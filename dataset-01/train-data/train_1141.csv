3,decent sound quality,these earbuds provide decent sound quality but they don't fit well. they caused my ears to hurt after using for 30 minutes
2,earbuds are too big for my ears,"I am a 5'7"" woman with an average head size. The earbuds are too bulky in diameter to fit comfortably in my ears. I can wedge them in somewhat but they hurt. My prior earbuds, made by Olympus, were just slightly smaller in diameter and thinner in bulk, and I could wedge them in easily. A small but crucial difference. These, I unfortunately must return."
4,good value,"wanted some inexpensive ear phones for wearing to football games, these fit the bill. Why spend a lot on something that is going to be shoved in a suitcase and jostled around all game??"
3,Good but not for long,"Every time I get these headphones they last me about a year, but ordered a pair on amazon and the left one died off in about a week. I guess I just got a bad pair this time but I'm still a bit upset."
3,Too Big :(,They won't stay in my ears cause they are so big.. I'm definitely not buying these again. You can'twear these to work out because they fall out constantly. I don't know if anyone else has this problem but I personally don't like them at all.
2,not the best,"I received these for chistmas as replacement to my ipod earbuds and I am less than satisfied, they will be returned. First, the bud shape is awkward and large, and becomes uncomfortable to wear after 10 minutes use. They are bass-ier than the ipod buds and I can't hear the singer's nuances as well, which may or may not be a minus to others, but I prefer vocals over boom. And yes they are light, but the material is a slick hard-plastic which is hard to grip and also hollow, so anything touching against the bud reflects into your ear..for instance, hair brushing over the outside plastic becomes amplified, which is annoying and distracting.The sound is decent for the price, and if you have short hair it may not bother you, but these are not the best choice for everyone."
1,I Guess You Get What You Pay 4,"These are really good to have sound wise,but far as quality you might only want to get these as a back up pair.My very first pair that came with my sony walkman mp3 player lasted about 4-5 years,I can deal with that.I bought my first pair of these to replace them and i pulled them from my bag wrong and one of the earbuds came of killing the sound from it,o.k. partially my fault.I got another pair and while i was at work i was jamming and then i litteraly tapped the wire and the left ear went dead WTF.Long story short good sound bad quality,buy for back up only!"
4,Good deal for earphones,"I also own a pair of Shure noise canceling earphones that I use for airplane trips. But those are too expensive to use for my clumsy workouts with my ipod, so I bought these as an alternative. Sound is much better than the Apple-issue white earphones and also an upgrade over similar JLab earphones I bought last year. The sound is richer and the bass is decent.4 stars based on price/value."
4,Great yet inexpensive product,When I purchased these I had the mindset of just giving them a try because they were only 8 dollars. I didn't expect too much. I got them to replace my Ipod earphones which are the lousiest earphones ever. more sound left the earphone to the surrounding environment than what actually entered my ear. These sony earphones are different. I am really happy with the purchase.
4,Great for the price!,"These lightweight, comfortable earbuds provide good, well-balanced, sound at an attractive price. They do not rival $200 headphones, of course; but they are better than one would expect for the price. There are no frills--I used to have a similar set with a small in-line volume control, but they were bundled with a Sony Cli√© PDA and don't seem to be available for separate purchase. One word of caution: an identical pair of these headphones developed distortion on one side after only about three months; I have no idea if it is common for them to go bad so quickly, but at their low price I was willing to gamble on another pair--so far, after about a month, there have been no problems."
4,Great ear-buds,"For the price and comfort, these ear-buds are great. I got these to replace the standard kind that came with my iPod shuffle. The chord is a little long and there's no way to shorten it which is frustrating when I'm jogging, but that's the only drawback. The ear pieces fit and are very comfortable and block out enough outside sound when I'm outside exercising. Sometimes I wear them for two hours at a time and experience no discomfort. For less than $10, totally worth it!"
3,"Good sound, poor design","Bought these because it seems like my standard in-ear headphones break once a month or so, and I needed to find a new cheap pair. The quality's actually pretty great. However, they hurt your ears after a while, and the cord is about 6"" too short -- it constantly pops out with my iPod in my pocket."
3,not bad for the price,"these earbuds sound ok, but there seems to be a slight buzzing when bass kicks in. i can't always notice it but it's there. also the cushion that slips over the ear pieces has already ripped, not that big of a deal and i expect it from 7 dollar ear buds. you get what you pay for, if you want ear buds that will last for years, go more expensive."
3,Excellent quality,"I have always been a Sony fan. This product has not let me down. The sound that comes out of this ear-bud headphones is really good. The quality of the material is really good, too. If you are looking for something cheap and good...this is your product."
2,Uncomfortable/Fall Out,"Not as good as the iPod buds. Contrary to the picture, these are intended for use with those cheap foam covers. Luckily, these covers were included in the package. Unluckily, these things ripped when I tried to put them on the buds. Without the foam covers, they are loose, uncomfortable, and fall out when running."
4,Great for the price,"For the price you cant beat the comfort and sound quality these offer. I wanted a pair that matched the comfort quality of the PSP headphones, which are the best bud-style I've ever tried. These are nearly as good. They sound quite decent too, which of course is as important.My only complaint is the cord could be a little longer - I use these for my PC at work, and find the length a little lacking."
4,Sony earbuds,"for $9, you cant go wrong. A bit bulky in the ear may cause a bit of discomfort but a solid deal."
1,not impressed,"I bought these replacement earbuds when I lost my iPod earbuds. I was unhappy with the thin sound, so I went out and bought other earbuds. I don't think I'll wear these earbuds again unless I lose the replacement earbuds I wear now and find that these earbuds are the only ones available to me."
1,blahhh,the sound quality was decent for the price... better than stock iPod earbudsonly problem is the left earbud busted after only a week. it works fine but with a very noticable buzzing.
4,Good sound not great.,"You won't get great bass out of these headphones but if you're in the market for ear buds you shouldn't be expecting it especially for this price. Unlike ear buds that you buy from the dollar store these won't burn out in a week. Anyways running for 4 months now, so far it beat all of my records for durability concerning ear buds I've owned."
2,They have come apart at the ears.,They worked great until the part that fits in the ear came apart. They were a back up set so they were used very little.
5,Very good Quality,"These are very nice headphones for the price.Just ordered my second pare, and plan to keep buying these if I need more headphones."
1,Breaks after 4 uses,The right ear bud failed after just 3 or 4 uses. It worked good until it just stopped working. Not much else to say about it.
5,FORGET THE BAD RATINGS,"THEY ARE PERFECT!! THEY ARE SO WONDERFUL WITH SOUND! I LOVE THEM! NEVER GONNA GET ANOTHER KIND OF EARPHONE EVER! As long as I have this and my sansa, I will live."
3,Short lifespan,"I owned mine for less than six months and already one side no longer works unless I shake the wire a little bit, but of course that gets tiring really quickly. And I'm pretty gentle with my equipment. Also, they do get uncomfortable when wedged inside the ear for too long. But the audio was phenomenal when they did work, so I have to accredit them a bit of a star rating for that."
4,Sony Earbuds,"This is a decent pair of earbuds for a good price. They have worked well for me. However, the foam covering comes off easily or eventually tears. The earbuds work just fine and are quite comfortable without the foam coverings though. All in all a good purchase."
4,I like this product,These are great the sound is good and they fit well.Con: The fabric that goes over the ear pieces will not stay on and I have already lost one of them.
3,Decent for the price,"I've had these for about 6 months and they've served their purpose. Decent sound quality, lightweight, and inexpensive. I never had a problem with them being uncomfortable, but they do tend to fall out from time to time when running/working out, which is the main purpose I have them. The real downfall for me was the short cord - if you have your desktop computer tower on the floor, don't expect to be able to reasonably plug them in and listen comfortably from your chair....or if you have your mp3 player in the wrong pocket the cord might not reach to your ears. Not to mention, they're malfunctioning now because of a broken wire probably that is causing one or the other speaker to cut out, so it's time for some new ones and I won't be getting these again. I guess you get what you pay for..."
2,Very uncomfortable and no bass,These earbuds are too big and don't fit in my ear without hurting my ears after awhile. You can definately feel that these are in your ears. As for the sound there is virtualy no bass whatsoever but the clarity actually sounds somewhat good. For the small price I paid I didn't expect much but these are too painful to use. I was hoping I could use these cheapos till they break but I'm in the market for a new pair of ear buds again.
2,Worse than what you pay for,"these ear buds itch my ears, and thier sound quality and comfort are worse than the pre-packaged iPod ear buds. these earbuds don't have noise canceling (i think thats a good thing but most people would disagree)I would recommend these ear buds if your like me and think that noise canceling is a bad thing;SONY MDR-E10LP Lightweight Earbuds (GRAY)"
5,Great value,"These earphones work very well for the price they are being sold at. I am by no means an expert in sound, but i am pleased with what i hear with these earphones."
2,Painful,After about 3 months it started shocking my ears and fell apart. Very painful. Wasn't even used that much. Next time will just pay more for better quality earphones.
4,I will buy more.,"I am a musician, and audiophile. I do not like in ear buds, but demand bass and treble. These sound terrific, especially for the price! No idea on durability yet, but I believe I will buy more! Give them a shot!"
3,Sounds great but they become uncomfortable after 30 - 60 minutes,The sound quality on these headphones is excellent but the size of the bud makes them uncomfortable to wear after a while...
5,Great company to deal with,Good ear buds for the price.Can't say how great it is to deal with Limited Goodskeep up the good work
5,A superb earbud for under 100.00 dollars.,Sounds inflated but some earbuds costing upwards to 100.00 don't sound any better than these do. The fit is not quite up to par but at this price point you have to give a little. Sony has done some good work on earbud tech. Lately and you are getting the rewards of this tech in all levels of product line.Buy them you won't be disappointed. Well worth the money !!!
2,the cord was too short,"I am around 6 ft tall, and with the ear buds in my ears, the cord was not long enogh to reach my pant pockets, the sound quality was fine, but the buds are a little big and the cord is a little short for my height."
4,Great for the $,"I got these ear buds to use along with my notebook computer since they are so small and easy to carry. I have had several Sony products in the past with no complaints and like this design of ear bud. Plus they are under $10, even if they get lost or break after a year or so your not out much. For what they are, they do a very good job. You can't really expect great sound quality or build quality in this price range. If you want a great set of headphones check out the Sennheiser HD-595s, you won't regret it."
2,I've never had luck with Sony products...,"There's little I can tell about the 818LP because my set...broke down after roughly 2 months of use.Other than that, I think that in terms of sound, they're worth the price but for a price just a bit higher you can get the Koss Spark Plug earbuds which outperform the Sony 818LP in ALL ASPECTS. The foam covers are not only difficult to put on, they fall off in an instant, mine lasted one week and one has gone missing, making the other one useless as there is no spare set included.Generally, I'm very disappointed with these earbuds, I expected more from Sony...MUCH MORE, but - just because of their sound - I give them 2 stars..."
1,Do not buy.,"These headphones do not meet up to their description. They broke after a week of usage. The sound was not clear as the original iPod headphones ( and a lot of people dislike the iPod headphones). I would not recommend. Buy skull Candy, way better, here is the link below.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005EV3JQM/ref=oh_o06_s00_i00_details"
2,bud too big,the part that goes into the ear is entriely too large hat it wont stay in my ear securely. EAR PIECE IS TOO BIG
4,Great sound,"The headphone is great for its size. One down: no foam replacement and they ware-out over time, and they don't sell them separate anymore (as far as I've seen)."
4,Sony MDR-E818LP Ear Buds,"When my other ear buds were lost, I went to Amazon.com to find suitable replacements and found these. I am very pleased and got them for a good price. I do wish they had a longer cord though."
1,"Cheap, decent sound quality, breaks in 1 week.",I've used these types of earbuds for about a year now. My first pair lasted about 6 months then if they are jerked out of your ear the cover of the bud breaks off and the cheap plastic bends so you can never put it back on again. Even if you do force it back on the sound quality is now distorted and you get high pitched ringing in your ears if you try to listen to music.I thought for [...] bucks it's fine to have to replace the earphones every 6 months so I bought a new pair. This time the earphones lasted 1 week and broke again in the same way. I don't know I might just have to go back to buying the overpriced ipod earphones.
4,"Decent, can't go wrong with Sony","I purchased these buds on a whim when I needed to listen to my Sony Walkman MP3 player. In short, these buds are decent for the price. Since I'm an audiophile, however, I love my Klipsch S4's much-much more. But at $80 a pop for what I paid for, that's in a whole different league.Sony, keep making great products!If you need something fast, something you can break-dance to while listening to music & not care if you yank on the cable and still sustain good audio quality, this is for you."
1,Needs real improvements,"I hate to write a negative review for such a great brand; I've been so impressed with Sony in the past. First off, these do not sit comfortably in my ears at all. I had my brother try, and they didn't stay in his ears at all either. There is also a fairly constant popping and staticy sound, which is highly irritating. They also look and feel poorly/cheaply made. I'm very disappointed in Sony, and I will think twice before ordering from them in the future."
1,Disappointing,"I should point out from the start that I've always loved Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni's books, and own most of them. They're the kind of books I'm always recommending to friends.But this was just awful - to be honest I didn't make it past page 50 because it was such a struggle to read. The language was very ""flowery"" and overdone compared to her previous books, and I didn't feel as strongly towards the characters as I'd done in the previous book.I'll undoubtedly read her next book when it comes out, but I'm not sure I'll be as eager as usual to get it."
3,"doesn't quite create the magic which was in ""sister of my heart""","after reading ""sister of my heart"", i was more than eager to read the sequel, but i must say that it left me very unimpressed. the magic that was present in sister of my heart was totally missing here, both in the contents and in the style. the author digresses so many times from the story, that half the charm is gone."
3,Not at quite the same level...,"After reading Sister Of My Heart I was eager for Vine of Desire. However, the fluid rhythms evoked in the first book did not translate here...I found this one lacking in in the same sort of magic - it was still a decent story, but not filled with the same imagery, smells, and delight of the first."
2,Definitely overwritten,"I loved Divakaruni's Sister of My Heart, so I was delighted to discover there was a sequel. However, The Vine of Desire simply does not compare to Sister of My Heart. My main complaint is that Divakaruni has taken the utterly loveable and pure characters of Anju and Sudha, and used what I consider gimmicky writing to tell the continuation of their story (among the gimmicks are letters, Anju's essays, baby Dayita's thoughts, and ""what I said"" and ""what I didn't say"" chapters). The book felt very unnatural to me; the forced styles put too much in the way of the reader and the characters. Reading it reminded me of high school writing assignments where doing something ""original"" (like writing a screenplay or poem instead of the assigned essay) was considered ""cool"". In The Vine of Desire, however, Divakaruni just couldn't pull it off."
1,Horrible!,"I've read about four of Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni's books and I have to say this was not an engaging read. Sunil's obssession with Sudha and her beauty was inexplicable. He hardly knew her, he fell in love with her just because she was beautiful?! I can understand attraction, but love? Come on. The man had hardly any redeeming qualities like most of the author's Indian male characters so I couldn't understand why Sudha or Anju cared about him either. It read like a silly 3rd rate Bollywood drama begging to be taken seriously."
3,A paler version of Sisters,"Although the prose is exquisite, as it was in Sisters of my Heart, the characters and plot were uninspiring in this sequel. Someone, the insight into the culture was strained by the US setting and convoluted, soap opera-like plot. We are repeatedly introduced to lovesick men pining for one women, but never are led to understand why they are so singlemindedly smitten. We witness the breakup of a marriage, but never really understand the cultural and personal dimensions of this disintegration. A second generation Indian-American is introduced as just another Indian, without much character development or insight into how he might have conflicts or identity issues when relating to Indians from India. In short, a paler and less stimulating read, unless you read it like a romance and little more."
4,Worth persisting,"I struggled to connect with the characters and for the story to develop in the beginning of this book after being rapt throughout ""Sister of My Heart"". Soon I was wrapped back into the atmosphere though. Don't discard the book early and you'll enjoy a classic tale beautifully told.I especially enjoyed the author's unusual techniques to flesh out the characters from many angles."
3,"Worth Reading, but a bit dissappointing","While Vine of Desire isn't nearly as great as Sister of My heart, it does have a charm all of it's own and completes the story. Sister of My Heart was a moving tale that spanned years, while this story was only a few months worth of life. Like another reviewer mentioned, I wished she would have stayed in India with her story.At times I felt it was overdone, too flowery. Sometimes it was confusing who she was writing about. Other than those drawbacks, I'd recommend this book to those fans of Sister of My Heart, and most importantly if you haven't read Sister of My heart that's a must!! It is by far the best book I read last year, full of emotion and beauty."
1,One of the worst sequels,This is one of the worst sequels ever written. Not coming up with it would have been better. Total waste of time and money.
2,Not nearly as good as I expected and hoped!,"I really enjoyed Sister of My Heart and was excited to learn there was a sequel ... and I TRIED to like it, I really did but the only reason I kept plugging away was in hopes that it would improve. The style of writing is MUCH different from the first book and no one is very likeable. Read her ""Palace of Illusions"" or Indu Sundresan's books instead ...."
4,Jealousy,"The Vine of Desire is a sequel to Sister of My Heart. It's the story of Anjou and Sudha, two cousins who have come to California from Calcutta. Both have problems from the past that they hope to begin healing through their relationship with each other - while at the same time learning to live with the knowledge that Anjou's husband is obviously attracted to Sudha. This book is written in a lyrical style, full of sensory descriptions that make it possible to absorb the writing thru the pores. Just open yourself to the colors, scents, sounds, and passion in Divakaruni's words - and melt into her world."
4,Awesome.... Just like Season One,"I love this show. Season two was great, but I noticed that the seasons get shorter. There are fewer episodes in this season. And I think that there are even fewer in the third season."
3,Two British musuem curators analyze legitimacy and loyalty,"This is a light-hearted, if still informative, book which I feel fortunate to have discovered in the bookstore at the British Museum in London. Written by two curators at the British Musuem in the department overseeing the coins collection, this book, well illustrated with coins and notes from different historical epochs, looks at the origins and dynamics of legitimacy, sovereignity, loyalty and rebellion in various episodes of political changes from ancient to modern times. Even though it reads more like a coin catalogue than a sociologically or historically penetrating analysis of these issues, it raises some important questions of how we come to give, withdraw, and subvert loyalty."
3,Ouch!,"Excellent item, at super low price. But packaging left something to be desired. First platter arrived shattered in pieces. Amazon quickly replaced at no charge, no problem there. Suggest adding a comment when ordering, requesting extra boxing / bubble wrap."
2,Predictable,I found the story boring and the characters predictable. The main character's motivations were unclear. Even the ending was dull.
5,A knockout book!,"I really loved this book! James Calder is a gifted writer who has created an imaginative, fast-paced, and truly clever mystery that hinges on cutting-edge biotechnology, but that also brings up interesting questions about the world biotech is producing. Bill Damen is a complex mix of macho and sensitive who has an artist's eye for detail, the hutzpah of a curious journalist, and a bulldog's fight and determination. But he also has a fine-tuned sense of how complicated relationships are between people, including himself, and a subterranean ambivalence about what it all means--so fitting for the Bay Area, I think. He's someone I'd like to know. The writing is witty, the story always compelling, and I can't wait to get my hands on the next one."
5,A book I will never forget,"I read this book years ago when I was a teenager. And like the previous reviewer, this book was given to me. It was very special as it was one of a collection that belonged to a grandfather I never got to meet. The memory of that story has stayed with me, even haunted me all these years. Unfortunately I don't know what happened to my copy and even my local library system doesn't carry it so I will have to track one down to read it again. I do agree that it would be great to see this book made into a movie."
2,Jacket Covers Matter,"I was excited to find one of the books that launched my preteen passion for science fiction, The Big Eye, still available. I purchased the book via First Editions and Rare Treasures. The hardcover book arrived in fairly good condition. However, the jacket cover was (is) badly torn and marred, including the jacket's spine. I'm disappointed that I can't display the cover over the book. Now, the jacket is carefully tucked in a plastic bag, leaving the bland hardcover naked on my shelf. At $12.95, I'm not happy.My other issue is with AMAZON. After my purchase I couldn't find the original product add to determine whether the jacket's cover condition was misrepresented or if I overlooked that the add had stated it was junk. I'd appreciate if Amazon would direct me to my order's detailed product description, including the jacket cover. Thanks in advance, Linda WichmanPS: I don't plan on future dealings with First Editions and Rare Editions."
5,definitely worth it!,"Bought this CD from a used bin , didnt expect too much but boy did it surprise me! At first you can almost hear every Seattle band's influence in them, but then the CD starts to grow on you...I dont go on any trips without this CD. Secret track on the CD is cool, without a doubt. Buy this!"

2,More Addiction Theology Than Actual Help,"This book is what happens when you take the position that the bible has all of the answers to all of lifes questions, and then try to fit everything else into that belief. This book is perfect for Christians wanting to read something that they already believe. Welch is clearly intelligent within this specific framework, but for someone who isn't already a Christian, well versed in the jargon and dogma, this book would barely make sense.Despite attempts at appearing compassionate and empathetic, the book still comes across as typically ""holier-than-thou"". It is more a book on ""Addiction Theology"" (that is, what does the bible say about addiction if we interpret with that in mind), but does not offer much real day to day help for a struggling addict.Although this book calls it ""sub-biblical"", I think addicts would be better served joining a 12 step group and going from there."
5,This book changed me.,"There is so much to say of the world today of idol worshiping. I took a hard look at myself and my ""casual"" and ""social"" drinking that I have been doing for some time now. I am a christian who is always attempting to grow in my relationship with the Lord. This book really spoke to me about a few of my idols that I have. I do not drink any more and I even slowed down on the sport team that I had been obsessed with. This is one of the best books that I have read. Very sound scriptually as well. I am ready to read some more of Welch's books."
4,Easy light fun - makes you want to visit Montana,I rented this movie based on the box cover. Not really looking for a romance movie just a nice drama. I found as I watched the movie I became more and more interested in the lives of the three main characters. The writing is not Shakespeare but the movie flows and the actresses are easy to watch. I enjoyed the play between the actors and seeing Montana. Did not really need the extra plot drama of the murderer plus ex-husband - one would have been fine. Otherwise a fine drama with some fun acting. I recommend if you want something easy for an evening.
4,It is what it is.,"This movie actually had decent actors. I think that should be addressed first and foremost. Most of the time when a romance novel is turned into a movie who ever decides to put it on screen usually casts attractive people with limited acting ability.That can no be said about this movie. The actors are pretty and seem to have acting capabilty. *gasp*I was a bit disappointed that the movie strayed so much from the Nora Roberts novel, but I can pretty much seperate the two and see each has its own creative merits. Lifetime didn't screw this one up."
1,Unreality,"The dialogue and action of this film from the outset hasan unreality that's hard to fathom. One example, 3 daughters attending their father's funeral and the blonddaughter is on the cell phone with some guy and she'sarguing loudly with profanity totally oblivious of theother sisters and the people at the funeral wake..like Icould care less..and the subsequent actions and script follow this general unreality in real life; I would dubthis as one of the worst examples of script, characteriz-ation and hardly worthy of Norah Robert's novel."
3,Disappointed,"I just had finished the book and really liked it! Couldn't wait to see the movie but was greatly disappointed. There was so much left out, along with changes that threw me off entirely, and saying out loud to my husband, ""No! That's not how it happened!"" And I did that several times. I was going to give it a lower rating, but... if I hadn't read the book, I guess I might say it was a mediocre movie-- thus the three stars. It could've been much better."
3,"The strong, the beautiful and the wimp","For those who read the book, this movie will be a disappointment. Conditioned inheritance works to tie this family back together, but not the easy way! Worth watching once."
1,"GT Interactive, too OLD for windows XP","doesn't play on newer computer. Made the changes to the compability as instructed by others. have many of the older Living Books CD games and after making the changes they are fine. NOT the GT Interactive CDs ""Just Me & My Dad"" and ""Just Me & My Grandpa"". they just won't play. bummer. They played on the old computer ... Looking for an old computer so they can be played."
5,Gotta get this one!!,"I truly believe any owner of a 94-98 Mustang must get this book. It is filled with illustrations and step-by-step instructions that make the procedure go smoothly.I needed to remove my door panel, for example, and I know that I would really struggled with it had it not been for the book. It showed what to do, and what NOT to do.You won't be sorry that you got this one!!"
3,"Good book, but using photos of 93 style 5.0 was wrong","Overall, this book has lots of good information but their coverage of the 5.0 engine was questionable. As anyone who works on the 1994-1995 cars knows, their are small but significant differences in the last 5.0's when compared to the 1993 prior models and when the author chose to use the old style engine photos I also question whether the specs published are correct for the 94-95 engine."
5,Concentric Circles of Concern,"The book was received very quickly and exactly as advertised. It was a gift for a friend who had been in the author's class at seminary. His copy of the book had been loaned out and not returned. He was glad to get this one, even with an autographed message from the co-author to the seller. I was able to tell him about the seller due to his excellent description of himself included in the description of the sale item."
4,Son loves this game,"My almost 5 year old has played this game everyday for the past month. I am sure there are still options he hasn't figured out. The game starts with a blank canvas to set up a train track and scenery to go with it. When you are ready to see the city come to life there is a control center to start your trains moving. The fun for him is setting it all up, just like with real legos."
4,Fun and easy to use.,"It's an easy game to operate with a lot of options that makes building the train line and city fun. However, it didn't come with any written instructions, and the Lego animated guide spokeman spoke very bad English with a Japanese accent. After 2-3 sentences, he only spoke Japanese, so the operations had to be easy to follow without written or verbal instructions. Other than that, it's a very fun game."
5,Very well written and entertaining book,"If you ever wondered if superheroes and supervillains can exist and have superpowers, then this is the book for you. Highly entertaining, well written and informative. I highly recommend it."
3,Light hearted escapism,"In an age when superheroes have more than a certain ""cache"" this is an interesting and entertaining series of essays examining the science of their arch enemies. Makes you smile and reflect in equal measure."
4,Hunter is back for more!,"Once again, Mack Maloney has written a book that I couldn't put down. Skyfire is filled with tons of action and even more mystery. If you are just starting the series, then this is a great one to start with. Series readers with find Skyfire to be an excellent continuation of the series!"
4,Charts that stand the test of time,"I had to buy myself a copy of this book after I borrowed a copy from the public library. I liked it that much.This book has 42 projects in all skill levels. Color photos of all projects are included in two gallery sections interspersed within the charts. Many of the projects also have black and white photos on the same page as the chart. Charts are black and white with symbols. Designs are charted for DMC and J&P; Coats floss. Most charts seem ""squished"" to me. I definitely used enlarged photocopies when working these designs. Charts are not computer-generated, so they appear uneven in appearance.Designs include trays, ornaments, bandings, framed pieces, bibs and other baby items, towels and linens, pillows, and more.I really like the designs in this book, but I think many of the color combinations used are awful. So I take liberty with my floss color choices."
4,Gifts or for yourself!,"this hardcover book includes many cross stitch patterns that you will want to stitch for yourself or for gift-giving. Chapters include Baby gifts, cat fancier gifts and heirloom gifts. The baby section has adorable animals and the cat section has many great cat patterns in all sizes. I like especially the smaller projects which are nice for gift giving in a hurry. A great book for the stitcher's collection."
3,The item works but..,The ad is kind of deceitful if I can post a picture of the actual item I had to use super glue to put it back together (it works though that's a plus!). I don't like how it's mostly plastic also..other than that it's a great product because it works.
4,Almost almost almost perfect!,"Straight out of the box, these cups and spoons are pretty phenomenal. The cups are hefty (I feel like I could do some serious damage with the one cup measure if I had to!) and long-handled. They are larger than what I'm used to--due to the oval shape and the long handle--but I'm sure I'll eventually get used to it.The only thing that held me back from a five-star review is that the spoons are *definitely* tippable. The clever handle that makes the spoon sit level paired with the rounded bottom makes for a pretty wicked wobble. All it takes is a small nudge to slosh out liquid measurements. But honestly, I can't think of a time where I've actually left a full spoon on the counter, so this shouldn't be a problem.Great set for a great price otherwise."
5,Measuring Away!,"When these arrived I tossed my old plastic measuring cup/spoon set and wondered how I could have ever used them.The stainless steel construction is durable and I love love love the oval shape. These are attractive, have good weight and just may sustain a lifetime of usage.These are however a bit pricey so if you are on the market for a similar alternative with the oval shape...go to Walmart. Oneida has a similar version for half the price. The only difference is Oneida's version is more of a brushed stainless steel, have shorter handles, and are slightly lighter in weight."
5,What a GREAT set.,"I simply love this set. Good weight w/out being too heavy. I had purchased a set of 18/10 scoops which came with a complete set of rectangular spoons (including the pinch and others) Thinking I had made a great purchase, I couldn't wait for them to arrive. What a disappointment, the scoops were awkward and the spoons were too long. Leave it to Cuisipro to save my baking station. Not only do I love this set, I intend to purchase the Cuisipro odd sized cups and spoons as well as the 2 cup measure to complete my measuring needs. I'm also thinking about the Calphalon oval canisters (oval seems to work for me)."
5,Professional Quality,I do a great deal of baking and using this set has been like going from a compact to a luxury car. My grandchildren will be using this set.
1,Did She Even Check Her Facts?,"I was looking forward to this book, learning about other female rulers, and at first I enjoyed it, until I got to sections on Queens I know about and found errors. She writes in the section on Elizabeth I that the plot that finally did in Mary, Queen of Scots was named after Anthony Bolington when it was actually ""ANTHONY BABINGTON"". In her section on Lady Jane Grey, someone I know a lot about, she called Frances Brandon, Jane's mother, Henry VIII's sister, when in fact she was his NIECE. And Elizabeth II's father is turned into George V instead of George VI! If she gets the history wrong on these 3 Queen's what history is she getting wrong on the others? Avoid if you want accurate history on female rulers."
2,Beware - this is not insurance . . .,"Both of my children have MacBooks for school and have been told that AppleCare is void once there are any dents or other indications that the MacBook may have been dropped. My daughter brought her MacBook in for a drive problem and was told she would have to leave it there for several days so she decided to wait. Then, when she brought it back for the repair she was told it was not covered because it ""looked like"" the computer had been dropped. The service is fine for software problems, but the chance that a college student's laptop will be in pristine condition after a year is pretty low, so next time I'll save my money."
5,Just To Clear Things Up,"Review Updated:It seems that my old review was wrong. Apple care can in fact be purchased at any time within the one year period as I had stated BUT it starts from the point of HARDWARE purchase not from the purchase of the warranty as I had previously thought. From Apple's FAQ:""Can I purchase the AppleCare Protection Plan anytime?You can purchase the AppleCare Protection Plan anytime within the one-year limited warranty period. Your eligibility for coverage under the AppleCare Protection Plan starts from your hardware purchase date. Apple strongly recommends that you purchase the AppleCare Protection Plan when you purchase your Apple product to maximize the additional benefits provided under the plan."""
3,Ask them what does it not cover ???,"You pay a hefty amount of $349 for applecare.. but if you accidently spill something on it and your macbook doesn't work anymore..applecare won't do anything for you. You are a busy person and have to carry around your laptop everywhere you go. But if you drop your sleek and slippery macbook by mistake and the screen is damaged, applecare won't care !!! In short any human mistake is unpardonable. You won't be given a second chance.I know that there are some other big stores whose extended warrenty covers these types of damages (spills / hardware damage) though."
4,"Applecare is a must, even just for the phone support!","Even if your computer doesn't break on you, the AppleCare phone support is great. When I had software questions, I was able to call in and get my questions answered very quickly, thanks to AppleCare. The hold time wasn't long at all, and I was greeted with some very nice and courteous people on the other line, who were able to help me out with my email issues with my Macbook.I'd definitely recommend it. I'm going to buy Applecare for my iPhone as well, because of the good service I received on my Macbook."
5,Best Computer in the World,"This is the best computer in the world, without a doubt, I will never in my life buy a PC again. Very quick performance, excellent graphics, greatest operating system. It has no viruses or spyware, etc, I dont event run a Antivirus Software. I really recommend this computer. I also recommend for quickest performance to buy an extra gigabyte of Ram, so that it has a total of 2 Gigabytes. I also recommend the Apple Protection plan, it is normal, that every computer in 3 years or less may have a problem, so to be safe, I would recommend buying the protection plan which is a warranty on parts for 3 years."
3,Protection,"I purchased this protection for my new MacBook Air, after repeating my purchase conformation to apple I finally received my AppleCare Protection Plan certificate. I purchased a 3 year plan but the certificate ends in 2012. Since I purchased the laptopapple gives a one year warranty this runs through 2010, AppleCare should run through 2013, right???"
3,NOT ACTUAL 3 YEAR WARRENTY,"It was great to now that I could get such comprehensive protection for my new Macbook. The great thing I was able to get it 50 bucks cheaper on Amazon. However, I do feel that calling it a 3 year protection plan is very misleading in that it counts the 1st year of ownership in the 3 years. Therefore, it is actually a two year extended warrenty, go figure?. I still don't get it, but its still worth it to get the coverage due to the fact that anything and everything does happen to these delicate electronics."
5,Applecare protection is necessary,I recommend this product for laptop computer users. This is additional coverage for your computer that is not covered by the original purchase.
3,too expensive,"This product may worth the money, IF your system suddenly stop working. Lower prices may beneficial for the consumer. Current applecare price is not appropriate with the laptop's depreciation value."
1,AppleCare Protection Plan MA519LL/A for MacBook,"I'm very annoyed because the product cannot be activated as it was purchased after the initial protection expired.I was not told this at the time of purchase and I have not been offered an alternative Plan. However, you have ofered to refund the purchase price. What a waste of time and effort."
4,Normally don't buy extended warranties...,But for a laptop I thought I would and given that Amazon discounts it $50 from what Apple charges made it a little easier to swallow. It is clearly something you hope you don't need to use but it is a bit of peace of mind.
4,Judging by the regular warranty's support...,"I had to use the regular warranty that came with the product more times than I wished I had, since it helped every time and the price for the replacement they changed were actually close to the Plan's itself. So I figured, given the circumstances, buying the extension is probably a good idea. In short, I'm judging by the support given under the regular warranty period, which I expect to be as good as the extension's. I'm not giving 5 stars because it's somewhat confusing when they say ""protection plan 3 yrs"". They are actually giving you just two more years (they shouldn't be counting the year given under the original purchase)."
5,One of Coach Troy's Best,"The variety of intervals in this video provides a great indoor climbing workout, challenging enough, but not ridiculous. I have a number of Spinervals videos and this has quickly become one of my favorites for a fairly intense interval day in my off-season program--an excellent tool for breaking up the monotony of indoor training."
5,Great workout,Of all the spinnervals DVD's I have this is the hardest workout so far. Very hard sprints towards the end of the workout. Great for Mtn. Biking.
2,"good book, nice layout, but oh the errors!","I'm referring to the McKay algebraic paperback edition here. I like the book a lot, it has some real nice games, some nice annotations, and the games are organized by theme and illustrate the concepts greatly.In fact, i might give the book 3/5 or 4/5 if it were not for the errors. There is atleast one error in every game i've looked at. I don't know if the errors exist in the original or if the problem was the conversion to algebraic, but it's really a problem.You've almost got to get the games from the internet just to follow the book, since the score in the book is so full of errors. Based on the errors I see, I suspect it's a matter of conversion to algebraic, and the problems probably do not exist in the descriptive edition, but that's just a guess. Almost makes me want to get the descriptive edition and find out...but not quite."
3,5 Star book 2.5 Star Edition,"I purchased this book after seeing that GM Spragget thought it was ""a truly great book."" I completely agree with this assessment. The games are exciting and tactical, but the variations don't swamp the reader like those in books by Nunn and Stohl.That said, the function of ""editor"" Burt Hochberg seems to be to mangle every piece of chess literature he touches. For example, the first game alone has three errors in the main game score. So avoid this book unless you have a large chess database to confirm the correct score.BTW, Hochberg's revision of Fine's the middlegame is considerably worse--I prefer the descriptive notation version for accuracy."
1,Pice of garbidge,"I am really surprised that the fanatic christians are even allowed to watch Tv. Isn't anyone who watches TV doomed to a life in hell and missery.But back to the subject. There is no evidence that Harry Potter is evil. J.K Rowling helped a little girl who had chancer. Do you think that soemeone who wanted to create an occult would do that?Secondly, Isn't Jesus teaching us to respect each other. Hasn't Lilly Potter died to save her son , just like Jesus died on the cross to save us. These books are not evil, they teach is the values of love, friendship and hope.Thirdly, these books inspired people to read again. That iis a good thing right.I can only recomend Harry Potter to anyone who likes to read"
1,This video tells a tale of the times.,I am troubled by this video and saddened by the fact that others want to control what to watch is acceptable. I and hopefully many others do not live by someone elses religious beliefs or look to a religious source for my viewing choices. This video! It is more fictional and dillusional than Harry potter.It seems that there are so many opinions on what makes a good person these days and what behavior is appropriate. This video is another crackpot conclusion as ridiculas as believieng that teletubbies have a sexual preference....
1,Pitiful,"Just don't waste your with watching this garbage. It is completely absurd and incompetent of defending Christian precepts because of its threatened religious position. True, even a true Christian by heart would and should despise this type of propaganda. It truly takes the full and typical Christian fanatiscism in their quest of survival. Poor, very poor material. Spend your money somewhere on another item."
1,john hagee is insane,"I saw one of john hagee's television shows on harry potter. He can not tell me something is evil when he hasnt even read it himself! He went on and on about how evil it was when hermione's head turned into a cat's head, but said that the Narnia series was ok. That is bull because in Narnia a boy is turned into a dragon by magic. When people make a stand on what is or is not considered evil by God they need to research beforehand. Harry Potter is full of morals and was only written for entertainment purposes."
1,Why is this garbage given credibility?,"If there was a no stars rating for this I would list it as no stars. This is an incredibly inaccurate, fear mongering video that not only lies about what Wicca is but does a disservice to the Harry Potter series as well. It is garbage like this that the Christian community swallows without question that does far more harm to Christianity than any enemy of the religion could ever do. The one thing I find interesting is that while Matrisciana is criticizing Harry Potter for ""propaganda"", this his her propaganda and she is profiting from this almost as much as Rowling is. The ironic thing is that she is making a living,however dishonest, by leeching onto Rowlings creation. Her fellow Christians should be ashamed of stuff like this."
1,Have You Missed the Real Message?,Any of you who love Harry Potter can agree with me and say that HP is not just about witchcraft and hidden meanings. If you have only seen the first movie you should be able to tell that the real moral of the story is about love and finding your innerself. The stories are fantasy and I think that everyone who reads them should be mature enough to know that. J.K. Rowling doesn't talk about casting spells on others for the fun of it or to make others feel bad about themselves. It is part of an interesting story that leads to a great and meaningful ending. None of you are J.K. Rowling so I do not think you should judge her by saying what you think she meant by some portions of her books. If you are a Christian (or any one else for that matter) I would not stop loving HP because there is truly nothing wrong with the books or movies if you know that they are fiction.
1,"ah, dumb","I go to a christain school and we had to watch it and it's stupid. I'm a big harry potter and and as all my fellow H.P. fans know, you really have to read the books before you judge it. I bet you that the next christain anit-something movie is going to be about the hidden meanings in Barney. Really now people, there are much better things to waste your time on. All in all this movie is supposed to be christain, but is completely full of hate. Now what kind of message is THAT sending out???"
1,*Vomiting all over the place*,"Well I'm a christian and I watched this video and this movie is STUPID!!!!!Prepare to puke all over the place after you see this. It is a pack of lies, and whoever believes this bull needs to get a life. All it is is just weak Christians going ""AH! HARRY POTTER! PURE EVIL!!! ALL DEVILS WORK!!!"" Oh puh-lease.Yes this is for christians, Well weak christians only. I'm a christian and I LOVE HP so SHAME on you whoever made this video."
1,"Stupid, beyond belief.","How someone can actually get a video like this released is beyond me. A a Wiccan, and fan of Harry Potter books (no I was a Wiccan before HP), I am disgusted. I never bash any ""true"" Christians, what I call them, who actually embrace the beliefs of ""Love thy neighbour"", and ""Judge not, lest ye be judged"".This video tells of how connected Harry Potter and real witchcraft are. First of all HP, and Wicca are NOTHING alike. We do not use lightning, or say funny words to make things happen instantly. Our rule is ""an it harm none, do what ye will"", a pretty basic rule.This video teaches your child to dislike pagans, witches, and others alike. Did we not learn anything from the Burning Times. You should teach your child to respect others for their beliefs, not to hate them for it. Do you really want to raise your child as a bigot?Oy vey. I only gave this video one star, because I had to."
1,"Liars, Damned Liars, and Jeremiah Films","This is another of those ""I wish I could give zero or a negative number of stars"" items.Jeremiah Films is a noted creator and distributor of what only can be described as books and videos of religious bigotry. This work, like others they have produced, is a mish-mash of ignorance-based mistakes, carefully-constructed half-truths, and outright lies, lies which the producers continue to spread even when the truth is brought to their direct attention.To put it bluntly, this is worthless trash, the modern equivalent of World War II Nazi propaganda about Jews."
1,Dangerous point-of-view,"As a Christian I feel I have to speak out against all those ""so-called"" Christians out there who seem to see evil in everything they disagree with. Those people are far more dangerous to children than any Harry Potter film or book! My four-year-old granddaughter is as sweet and innocent as they come and she adores Harry Potter. She is completely unharmed by this ""evil influence"" and has no plans to become a witch. And I'll bet she is far more healthy and well-balanced than those children whose parents see nothing but the evil in the world. Did you ever notice how these same people who call themselves true Christians never seem to get much enjoyment from life and have no sense of humor whatsoever?"
3,Informative but not exceptional.,This video probably contains information that the uninformed would enjoy. I did not find out much that I didn't already know. I would have liked seeing more scripture to validate how God feels about it. Exposing this material for what it is should scare people but it comes across as informative and benign.
5,Must See,This truly is a must see for all parents concerned withprotecting their children from the evils of this world.Satan is alive and well and we must take a stand for whatthe Word of God says. Have nothing to do with witches etc.Evil made to look innocent is exactly what the Harry Potterbooks does.
4,Very good Jeremiah Films video on crap children's propaganda,Witchcraft repackaged fro kids is still witchcraft!The Philosophy Lover is lost in the sauce. HarryPothead is brainwashing and garbage. Get Dave Car-radine's Wizards of the Lost Kingdom II instead.That was the original.
1,No stars & no brains,"Harry Potter is satanic demonism re-packaged,or so the two""best-selling""autors of this wildly moronic program would have you believe..Of course,once you become aware of the fact that these two write and shill for the extreme right wing of the fundamentalist christian movement thier claptrap becomes more understandable..I have to wonder who buys the offal these two churn out,giving them thier""best-selling""status..It is frightening to think that there are THAT many foolish and intolerant people out there..."
5,A VERY informative video on witchcraft and the occult,"This DVD is for anyone who is concerned that the Harry Potter books and movies might be dangerous for their kids. It's narrated by a former witch, so the information presented has more merit than it otherwise would. The video points out that Wicca, the religion of witchcraft, is a recognized religion that receives tax-exempt status in the U.S., and that Wiccan religious practices are present in the Harry Potter books. Some actual Wiccan practices that appear in the books include spell-casting, the drinking of blood, possession, and the manipulation of circumstances and objects with the mind. There is footage of actual Wiccan rituals, and several actual witches are interviewed. The DVD also points out other movies and TV shows that contain occultic material. ""Harry Potter: Witchcraft Repackaged"" was extremely helpful to me as I wrote ""Jaime"", the second book in my fantasy book series, as it deals with witchcraft and the occult."
4,Incredible insights on a working man's life on the railroad,"This book brings to life the hard, gritty and dangerous life of working on the railroad. While there's a ton of romaniticized railroad books, this one give the reader insights of what the working stiff had to endure. It does it, however, with an obvious love of railroading, and of the man the book is about."
5,So you always wanted to be a steam railroad engineer...,"As an amateur rail and telegraph historian I found this book quite enjoyable, full of detail and from a personal perspective. It really gave the feel for and understanding of what it took to be an enginman in the timeframe covered, the rise and apex of steam railroading in the US."
5,A Must For Steam Era Locomotive Fans,This is one of the very few books I plan to keep. I have read it twice and each time get more out of it. Oscar Orr was an outstanding loco engineman and his son is a fine author.I recommend getting a map of Pennsylvania so you can become familiar with the area where Mr. Orr operated. The maps in the book are good but a state map brings it more into focus.DC
3,Great product with a bug and poor support!,"My windows system (98SE) froze on reboot after I installed this drive. Called support number twice and no answer after 15 minutes on hold each time. Sent an email, CMS responded by email after 3 days. Response was not helpful. Eventually realized that the automatic formatting of the drive done in setup was faulty. Reformatted in windows and ran scandisk and now the drive works great. The software is the best automatic back up software I have ever used. Backs up different back up sets on any schedule in the background. The write time is extremely fast. The drive is quite noisy with an audible whine."
3,Man Awakened by Women's Spiritual Essence,"This book is great. Couldn't put it down. Start to finish this book guides you through the tumlutous path to self-realization. An in depth study that doesn't get bogged down in jargon, this book is suitable for the average reader."
5,EXQUISITE ALBUM,I have to write that this album is great. I love it. His voice is very beautiful and each song are very good.
1,Ahh i dont know about this,"Low in protein and no vitamins. But thats okay since its cheap.But from going from Isopure protein to this, i feel weaker and got sick.Im not sure if this was made badly, or it was a coincidence. This stuff is made by Vitamin Shoppe so it should be dependable.But i suggest sticking to companies that are famous for substance powders."
3,No improvements + Side effects,"I worked out as usual, took the product for over a month and all I got was bloated. You cannot take with milk but only water which makes it taste like chocolate Chalk. Product caused me several days of runnys bowels, headaches and otherwise no reconizable postive effects. Spoke to my doctor and of course he advised not to take products such as this. I am going to go ahead and use it up but will not be buying again."
3,"good storage, drags the bottom using the rollers","While this bag holds 50 lbs of carefully packed clothes for a business trip, It did prove to have a flaw during the transport from airport to airport. It does drag a bit while using the roller feature, thus after just one use it already has a hole in the bottom. hope this helps"
1,Looks promising,"I bought this about 8 months ago and used it for 3 trips within the US on different major airlines. The storage aspect of it is great and it's really easy to move around. But, after two trips that plastic buckles on the sides broke. After my 3rd trip the lining on the outside broke away (the green outside lining). So now it looks like a shredded piece of garbage after 3 trips. I won't buy anything from High Sierra again. :-("
4,Great Travel Bag,"Well designed, well made. If you need a larger sized duffle that can double as a roll bag or a backpack this is perfect. Can hold a ton of stuff, but also very easy to go over 50 lbs in it."
5,Built tough,I love the way this bag is designed with different comparments. It has a great design and is tough for those long trips requiring connections and many luggage movements. You can keep fragile items between clothes at the lower section. You can keep pressed clothes at the bottom. Bag of toiletries and books on top and then the side can take stuff you need to reach quickly either during your trip or as you arrive your destination.
4,Love this bag!,"The wheeled duffel is a great bag. Handle telescopes nicely, lots of compartments for 'stuff', rolls nicely, etc. Oh yeah, it has an 'expander' feature which comes in handy (like when you go on a trip and come home with more stuff than you came with). We have used this luggage, along with some other pieces on several trips now and they have held up well so far. The kids can easily pull their own bags. They are good bags for a weekend away or a longer vacation. My only complaint is that there are so many zippers that it's confusing and sometimes you wind up unzippering the wrong compartment. The only zipper pulls that look a bit different are the expander set of zippers. Other than that, my family and I love our bags!"
2,Poor zippers and handle design,"The zippers on this bag are a pain to use and they put a pull tab on the expanding zipper instead of the main compartment. When closing the main compartment the zipper hangs on every corner even when it's not full. After one international trip, the stitching coming undone on one of the handles. All in all this bag is ok, but I wish I purchased a Travel Pro bag instead."
3,TO SMALL,WAY TO SMALL...BOUGHT AS AN EXTRA BAG..BUT WHEN IT CAME TO PACKING IT...IT DOES NOT HOLD WHAT A HARD EDGE SUITCASE DOES...ENDED UP KEEPING IT FOR SHORT TRIPS32 INCH IT MAY BE..BUT NOT ENOUGH DEPTH ON THIS..BEWARE.
1,Fell apart on the second day,"My wife and I went to Amsterdam a few months ago, i searched the internet for the best rolling duffle bag i could find, i bought two of these for the trip.My wife's wheel broke off on the street day one and on day two the back of mine shattered, yes shattered and that made the wheels cave in. We searched all day for a luggage cart to bunge our new broken bags to and spent the next 10 days traveling europe wrestling with this shattered back, wheel draging crap!Dont bother with this brand if you need a strong pull bag!!!"
5,Great duffle that stands on its own,"My wife and I took this on a cruise recently and loved it.The features that I like about this duffle:1) It stands on its own even when fully loaded2) It has a separate drop bottom either for folded clothes, or shoes.3) You can simply unzip the separator to have one huge compartment if needed.4) It has large wheels that wheel smoothly.5) A separate zippered compartment on top for easy access.6) Collapses down for easy under-the-bed storage7) Fits a lot of stuff without overpacking...we came in at around 48 lbs fully loaded.The only areas I would improve are:1) There are two settings for the telescopic handle (short and long) so you have to jerk the handle past the ""short"" setting every time which is a little annoying. I am 6'2"" and the ""long"" setting doesn't seem to be long enough in my opinion.2) The velcro covered handle for the straps on the top isn't big enough and comes apart easily ."
3,roomy and functional,"I ordered this duffle specifically for a 10 day vacation with my family in Italy. While the bag is very roomy and the wheels made it easy to transport from location to location, the bottom got a rip in it the very first time I used it, literally when it came of the luggage carousel, I noticed the tear. Good bag, but not extremely durable."
3,Not a carry on bag,"I like the bag quite a bit, but saw it advertised as a carry on. It is definitely not a carry on - too large."
2,Really poor transfer,"This is about the worst transfer to DVD I've ever seen. The original films may have been shot on 16mm, which could explain it. The films are not really feture length, more like about 45 minutes each. I didn't even finish watching the first one; the second one is all right. Not worth the money."
5,excellent SPL meter,"I checked this the other day against an expensive, calibrated instrument. It was only about 1 dB off. Easy to use, convenient 2-range scale, has no more than the necessary options. A bargain at the price."
1,Disappointing,"I'm very hard of hearing. I bought this instrument with the idea that I could measure the sound levelsfrom my TV and radio and find out what people with normal hearing hear. That way I wouldn't beturning my devices up too loud. However this gadget doesn't offer an average sound level measurementand it's impossible to use for that purpose. Exactly what it's supposed to be used for I have no idea andthe ""instructions"" that came with it are so vague as to be useless."
5,Great SPL meter,"My Radio Shack analog meter finally died and I needed a good replacement for my pro-audio home studio. I looked at several different models, but not all had the modes that I need: fast/slow response and A/C weighting. This one has those settings as well as a hi/lo range selection and performs very well. I wish it didn't forget my chosen settings, i.e. slow/C, at power off. I have to reset them each time I turn it on. Overall, I'm extremely pleased."
2,Great for Pillowcases - Bad for anything else,"I've had my machine nearly two weeks now. I've made some beautiful pillow cases, but I cannot work with any fabric heavier than that! It bunches up and ties horrific knots in fleece, flannel, denim, I've adjusted everything from tension to feed dogs, nothing will help this machine. The one step buttonhole would be amazing if it weren't tying knots in my fleece. Decorative stitches are beautiful on lightweight fabric, but again, useless on medium to heavy fabric.Automatic threader works well for me. Would NOT recommend this product."
1,factory serviced? what factory??,"Purchased factory serviced machine thinking it had been serviced in a factory,wrong.Had been delivered less than 1 hour and I'm sending it back for refund.Broken pattern selecter knob,can't select any pattern.I have several Singer machines,this one is not up to par,even for the price.Would like to know what factory was it serviced at."
5,Mr & Mrs Wilkes,"My wife says that she loves sewing on this sewing machine and has been sewing for over 50 years. It is easy to thread, easy to use. In short she is very happy with it. This was our first purchase over Amazon.com and the price was right, delivery was good and the product is all it was supposed to be. This will not be our only purchase from Amazon.com. We are already looking at some other items we could use."
2,Good Lord,Good Lord. This was a very consise and insightful book. It's also very often wrong. Too often.
3,"Regular, kind of decaf....","I am preparing for the CCNA exam, I read this book first of all. It gives you a basic understanding of many topics in the exam objectives. But it's lack of in-depth concepts make it a bad single choice to prepare for the exam."
3,needs editing,"After reading the entire Steve McQuerry Cisco Press book, I found many mistakes in examples and questions in the CCNA CheatSheet book. There are also errors in the answers on the CD-ROM practice test questions. The book does a good job of summarizing at the end of every chapter what you need to know on those subject areas. But overall, it needs to come out in a second edition or the publisher needs to have a website listing known errors."
2,I prefer Hag Seed,It's nice to have earlier material from band (I only recently purchased this) but I think they really hit their stride with Hag Seed.
5,Its so cute and soft!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I got this and when it came my mom said look its my spotted frog and i ran and grabbed it from my mom and ran upstairs to put him online i love him he is cute soft and great for your webkinz collection i highly recommend it to any kid who likes frogs
2,"If you are looking for a hot Collectible, Check out Discmo","Haven't we done this before. Really, how many stuffed animals can a kid have. And if you want stuffed animals, try BEANIE BABIES....They sell for three bucks now, just like these will a year from now. Anyway, if you are looking for a hot collectible, check out Discmo. They are very durable toy discs sold in themed sets as well as individually. The cool thing about them is they are a totally opened-ended toy with educational value. On top of that, they are a collectible. Anyway, my kids and all thier friends love them. They like to find new way to play. I feel good becasue I am providing them with a toy that is actually helping them develop critical skills and also encourages use of the imagination. Check them out.Elephant Discmo"
1,A Good Movie to Cure Insomnia,"Good actors, bad movie. Sad, boring and somewhat mean-spirited. The plot and the movie will cure insomnia. I kept falling asleep watching this, but like a fool, would go back to try to finish it the next night, hoping that SOMETHING would be funny or interesting. Well, it never did get interesting, it wasn't funny, and the story wasn't much of a story. Maybe the editor and director fell asleep while making it, or someone lost half the script and made the movie anyhow.If this goes on sale for a penny, you might get your money's worth.Written by Dear Miss Mermaid, Author of ""Hurricanes and Hangovers""."
4,"Fun, cute, different","Nice to see something different from lego - I am sure lego fans have also got tired of yellow blocks to make diggers/earth moving equipment and the like, or grey stuff to make space stuff... so to find something cool like a snowmobile is great!The build was fairly challenging - which is nice as it keeps you interested and paying attention to the instruction sheet. Certainly kept the 32 year old recipient (a snowmobile fan!) entertained for an hour."
4,Essential reading,"At times this book was very tedious, but in the end very eye opening. The book is listed at 448 pages, but that includes over 100 pages of references/notes. Mr. Bovard is very meticulous and appeared, at least to me, to be just laying out as many facts as he could, then letting the reader draw their own conclusions. There's a great deal in here that may surprise you -- maybe even rub you the wrong way if you're a strong supporter of the current administration. The chapter ""Iraq and the War on Terror"" is very insightful and timely, in light of what is currently going on over there. Again, Bovard doesn't prescribe any remedy -- he leaves that to the reader. You owe to yourself to become more knowledgeable about the policies our government has engaged in/is engaged in -- in our name -- around the world, and what effect, if any, the current policies to address terrorism may or may not have."
5,KNOWLEDGE IS POWERLESS,"IM SURE FROM ALL OF THE OTHER 5 STAR REVIEWS THAT THERE IS NO NEED FOR ANOTHER COMMENT TO PRAISE THIS OUTSTANDING DOCUMENT.I NOTICE NO CRITISM FROM THE CONSERVATIVE RIGHT. BOVARD HAS 'EM BY THE BALLS, AND THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING EXCEPT LOOK THE OTHER WAY.THIS BOOK SHOULD BE REQUIRED READING IN ANY POLITICAL SCIENCE COLLEGE CLASS. IT EXPOSES THE LIES AND ABUSE OF POWER FROM THE U.S. REGARDING THE RECENT TERROR CONFLICT SINCE 1980, AND AMERICA IS NOT AN INNOCENT ""SLEEPING TYRANT.""TERRORISM AND TYRANNY IS KNOWLEDGE, BUT IT IS ALSO POWERLESS IN THIS HATEFUL, MODERN WORLD."
1,Waste of time and money,Hated it threw it behind the tv with meet the parents were it will never see the light of day. 1 star is to good for it
5,Long lasting outdoor flood,"ThisGE 40791 90-Watt PAR38 Outdoor Halogen 3-Year Floodlightwas first installed over one year ago, versus other floods promising long life. This GE 40791 is still going strong. I've had to replace the other so-called long life bulbs. I have outdoor flood lights that are on all night for security and beauty. I have standard outdoor flood light sockets, the kind you can adjust in all directions. This will fit standard sockets."
1,Does not work with recessed lighting fixture,The bulb is too wide to fit a recessed lighting fixture....No mention of this in the description...BEWARE...Returned for a full refuned
2,Looked cool while it lasted....,"The keychain itself looks sharp. I was very pleased when I received it. I didn't want it to get too worn, so I put it on a set of keys that gets very little use. After about 2 months of ownership, it broke! The screw holding the pendant on to the swivel stripped. I plan to glue it, but given the option, I would not have purchased it had I known it would break. Looks awesome if you plan to hang it on a hook and leave it there, but I'm assuming that's not your intention."
1,Taking it back,"This Singer is no good. I have attempted sewing with this several times, and have unfortunaly been able to make only ONE successful line of stiching. I have played around with this so many times thinking that ""maybe this time it will work"" but it hasn't. I tried contacting Singer and got back a standard email that did not have anything to do with my question. Also, the instruction book that claims to be easy to read, explains things in a difficult manner, and the pictures that go along with it are no help. Therefore, I give up, and am taking it back."
1,It has only been stress and a hassle owning this machine,"I have tried using this machine about 4 times and have had issues each time. The bobbin gets tangled very easily and my bobbin holder actually cracked so I need to replace it. The machine is not user friendly. It's very cheaply made. I'd recommend spending more money on a higher quality machine. So far, it has been nothing but pure frustration!"
3,It's pretty good,"I haven't had the issues that the other reviewers have had with this machine. I never did much sewing, but now I am making a quilt, and it's going pretty well. This machine is working just fine, and as I am going along, I'm getting better acquainted with sewing straight seams and getting things to look how they're supposed to. I think this is an okay machine, although to be honest, I don't really have anything to compare it to. My mother is a master seamstress, but I've always been forbidden to touch her machines, so I really don't know. All I know is that this machine seems to be working fine."
3,Fine for beginners,"My grandma gave me this machine when she couldn't use it anymore. It only has two different stitches- straight and zig zag. It doesn't come with many attachments and it's hard to find feet to fit on it. I was, however, able to start a small business with this machine. It did what I needed and is good for a beginning sewer. Don't buy it if you want to do more than straight or zig-zag stitching."
4,Riveting true crime story ... euthenasia,George Zygmanik was paralized from the neck down after a motorcycle accident. His younger brother Lester loved and idolized him. George begged Lester to kill him. Lester shot George to help fulfill his death wish. What follows in this book is the riveting true crime story of Lester's indictment for first-degree murder of his brother George. This book is mostly about the trial and all the parties. It's a truly riveting story!
5,Works well to remove Torbot Skin Bond,Works well to loosen and remove Torbot skin bond that we use to tape Doberman puppy's ears. We wipe the ears down with alcohol after removing the skin bond with Uni Solve.
5,great stuff,"will remove the toughest adhesive with no problem. my husband had major stomach surgery we were given a small container to remove the hospital dressing..it worked so well we purchased the 8 oz bottle, I little goes a long way."
1,This was a bad song by NAS,"NAS has done songs. Some of which were thoughtless. There were some good songs, like ""NAS is like,"" and ""Hate Me Now,"" but this was a dis to Eurythmics and M.M. NAS has crossed the line on this one."
4,High quality material but a little small,"This is a very lovely house flag, but it has two issues. First, it does not have holes for flag pole pins or screws to help hold it in place. It is also a bit small for my tastes, but I couldn't find a 3' x 5' of this flag. It is very beautiful however, and definitely annoys my Cubs loving neighbors. Go Reds!"
5,Hudson Taylor,"It inspired, and helped me.I love it solo much, so much, so much l love it so much. Bye"
2,For young kids,"I am an adult. I was excited to have picked this book up at a book fair. I really wanted to like this book. But , I couldnt finish it. The description says for 10 and up, should say 8-13. I found it too simple. Just couldnt get past a couple of chapters. I think anybody over the age of 13 will be frustrated. I am going to see if I can find an adult version...."
5,Hello Bo-Bo...,"My 3-yr-old niece really loves Diego. We got her the Diego plush doll and this Rescue Monkey. This monkey says little phrases from the show when you push the button on its collar, which she loves. She took him out of the cage right away, and now uses the cage like a lunch box, suitable for carrying sippy cups or other items. A great item for Diego fans."
1,Truly Awful Book,"I had no problems with the delivery or anything of this book, but God, it was horrible. Just the most dated, cliched, predictable feminist literature I've ever read. I got it for a book club. We all agreed it was bad. I understand it was groundbreaking when it was first published, but these days I would recommend skipping it."
4,Spiritual Heart of Historic Mining Town,"Colorful narrative by reknowned Nevada story teller about a majestic, Victorian Gothic church, which is the architectural centerpiece in one of America's most famous mining towns. Many of the old buildings in this mining town that financed the North during the Civil War are decaying and fragile. This guidebook invites you into the interior of the mother church to Nevada Roman Catholics, which has been lovingly restored. The author has been the choirmaster to St. Mary's Church for many years."
4,great album,"I heard 'driving in a perpetual summer' on WRAS 88.5 (georgia state university) and thought at first it was some project of j. robbins... well, he produced it. that song alone had me sold. the band is great. if you like jawbox's 'for your own special sweetheart' then you'll like this album. it just rocks!!!"
4,Simple to use - too quiet,"This metronome/timer works well. It's intuitive to change modes and adjust settings. The only drawback is that the ticking sound is too quiet, and if you can't hear it when you're playing, it's not a particularly useful metronome."
4,Low Tech-Hi Tech,"Suffering from whiplash & could not spent more than 15 minutes on my laptop. I now spend an hour or more. Was a bit worried about the weight tolerance as I have a ""larger"" notebook; but so far so good. I really like."
1,The ledge is very flimsy.,Mine broke after 1.5 yrs. almost broke my laptop as well.Will NEVER buy an xbrand laptop cooler AGAIN.next I'm going to try the R9-NBS-4UAK.
4,Just what I wanted,I was working in an area that was pretty cramped. This stand worked great for it. One thing if you laptop has anything on the front such as an dvd drive then it will be a pain to get to.
4,"Great, sturdy stand!","I wanted to get something like this for my laptop so that I could use another monitor, keyboard, and mouse with it so that it'd function more like a desktop model, and I used this stand for several years before giving it to a friend. I like the smooth sliding angle adjustment, the flip-down ""fence"" for the front of the computer, as well as the skid-free grips and how it could swivel for best positioning. The fan was a tad loud, however, especially so after years of use with dust build-up. When I got a newer MacBook Pro, I went ahead and bought a bamboo stand with a super-quiet fan and am enjoying the more slim look and the quieter sound of the airflow. My friend is enjoying this stand for this office laptop."
2,Adequate,"This is the second laptop stand I bought after I had to return a previous model which couldn't support my 17"" laptop in a stable manner.This one does support my 17"" laptop well but lacks portability and cannot be set to an angle that I like.I much prefer to use an altogether different stand from Targus which amazon does not carry at the moment. That model is much more portable and can be set to an angle that I like."
4,Great stand,"Not the heaviest plastic but it holds my monstrous 17"" brick with no trouble. Adjustable angles allow you to get it at eye level or line up with another monitor. Overall a great product. As soon as I brought it into work four co-workers ordered theirs."
4,was as described,"it is what it is--I like it, does what it is suppoeed to do, however if i had it to do over probably would have gotted the versoin of this stand that has built in usb connections. I didn't because i already had sufficient usb ports for my needs. Still it might have been nice."
5,just the one I was looking for,Hard to find item/ it was just the one I wanted. Arrived in a timely fashion even during the hectic holiday season
4,I did not see it coming,"Noomi Rapace is obssesed with protecting her son from the hallucinations caused by her mental disorder. Hallucinations that extend to everything around her. In order to protect her son, she goes to an electronics store and buys a baby monitor from the lonely Kristoffer Joner. Rapace often listens through the baby monitor to a boy being mistreated in the building where she lives, a boy that was killed long ago. In the meantime, Rapace's son befriends a boy, but who this friend is we only find out through the help of Joner, who gets caught up in Rapace's world of paranoia.Paranoia, loneliness and murder are intertwined in this slow pace but suspenseful and bleak norwegian film full of unexpected twists and full of figuring out on our behalf."
3,Interesting thriller,A rather deceptive thriller with a wonderful performance my Noomi .The film teeters between a study of mental illness and supernatural elements as well. Great performances from the entire cast.
2,Well Acted but Depressing,"Four stars for the acting, one star for the content, which averages out to two and half stars. If you're like me and prefer to watch movies which inspire or at least entertain (meaning you've gained something satisfying from it) then this movie is not for you. The only inspiration I got from this movie is a desire to put a gun to my head which brings me to the conclusion that worldviews matter and are reflected in the movie being produced- godless worldviews focus on depravity and hopelessness, but a worldview which affirms the belief that we are created in the image of God tend to focus on things that are pure and lovely and praiseworthy even in the midst of despair, such as, for example, Frank Capra's It's A Wonderful Life."
5,Great Disney CD with real Spanish vocalists,"Disney hired a variety of very talented and semi-popular vocalists for their Spanish versions of their animated musicals. This is a great compilation of these Disney princesses. From Susana Zabaleta singing ""Colores En El Viento (Pocahontas)"", the fabulous Tatiana (""No Hablare"" (Hercules)) and Analy (""Reflejo"" (Aladdin) and ""Reflejo"" (Mulan)), you get fantastic vocals that not only children will enjoy but adults who love vocals and musicals!Worth every penny to get some showtunes En Espa√±ol."
1,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with the music on this cd. The versions were not good, the music was not exactly as the one we're used to and some of the singers were not as good as those in the English songs. I wish I could return it."
1,Pathetic,"you know what i havent even read this entire book yet, but I do have to agree with the anger of the 1st comment poster, who actually is apparently related to me. If Arthur Mohr's parents were her grandparents, she must be his neice, and I am related to Arthur and Gloria Mohr(not a fact I am particularly proud of) thus making us related somehow. As far as the book, it makes me sick. Thats really all I have to say. What kinda of person writes something like that? I'll tell you, some one looking to make a quick buck and soak up soome pitty. Give me a break. People should have better things to do than read this pathetic attempt for attention."
1,A Story of Lies,"While I miss my Grandmother, Mr Mohr's sister and Mrs Mohr's cousin, every single day, I am glad she is not alive to read this book. It is full of lies, and the authors have chosen a ""Woe is me"" attitude. From the title, ""Poverty's Child"" to the last word, this book is nothing more than a way for them to make money. What about the brothers and sisters? It's as if he was the only child in that house. My Grandmother and Grandfather worked very hard to aquire what they had at the end of their lives. The depression was a time where most had a difficult life. Some choose to overcome and some choose to sit on a mountain of self pity."
3,beres does it again,"I have always been a huge Beres Hammond fan, he truely is the best. This is a very impressive cd. It becomes more and more enjoyable the more you listen to it. I have to behonest i was actually expecting alot more from him since to me he is the ""Phil Collins at his best of reagge"". Beres has a truely unique incredible voice and it never seem to age either. I was expecting this cd to be as good as his ""putting up a resistance"" cd but it came a little short. This able is far more diverse the all the other ablums and obviously Beres uses more modern beats but all in all it still was one of the best ablums to come out."
5,Wicked!!,"Once again the Maestro of Reggae music has delivered an outstanding album. How can one man be so prolific..How does he do it? The album is laced with some of the wickedest rockers beats and lyrics. If you don't have this one in your collection, you're making a mistake. Get it!"
5,A good book for all ages.,"My teacher read this book to me in 6th grade, and it is indeed a great book!!! I loved it then, and I love it now, I would recommend it to anyone and everyone. It *is* mainly a childrens book, but it's also great for all other ages!!!"
1,over priced,"end caps should be included with the cross bars...they are only pieces of plastic that provide Yakima's advertising. the product shipped from the east coast to Oregon. by the time I paid for shipping each cap cost me about $3.50 each. Even after using them for only a month, I noticed one of them had cracked and was about to fall out. This isn't indicitaive of most Yakima products. I haven't tried it, but it seems a champagne cork would work as effectively, and drinking the champagne would be an added benefit...times 4."
5,Original is good,"Stick with original equipment, I tried other solutions and they did not last or were not staying put at the right time."
2,Fragile,"These are great headphones. I've owned at least five sets. All of them comfortable, all of them sounded great. And the inline volume control is incredibly convenient. Unfortunately, I need to advise you NOT TO BUY THESE HEADPHONES.Why? Well, there's a problem with the construction that whenever the cord snags on something, more often than not the left headphone stops working, never to live again. The first few times, I just thought I was a klutz, so the third time it happened, I ordered two sets to replace it. Well, it just snagged again after a month's use, and again, the left headphone died.It's finally occurred to me (slow learner, here) that MOST people will probably snag their headphones at least as often as I do, so most people will not get more than a few months use out of these. So I regretfully have to advise you to avoid these otherwise wonderful earphones. And I'm looking for something comparably cheap and good with an in-line volume control."
3,Not for certified coaches,"Another of the many books out there with ""coaching"" in the title, but a mixture of life coaching, mentoring, sports coaching and other disciplines inside. If you are looking for a parenting book, it's fine. If you are looking for real life coaching stuff, there are better choices."
5,One of the Few bands that are the BEST but still not Heard,"This album is a different band than any you have ever heard. They swing from Hard-Hitting Metal/Acid songs like Cinema, to slow painfully sad (in a good way) songs like The Sad Ballad of Danny Boy and Clean Plastic Baby. It is awesome CD!!!! (I will be true, though, a couple of songs are like jungle beats, they are cool and everything, but they could have left those out.)"
4,Floater's first change of many,"In Floater's second album ""Glyph,"" the band takes on a bit more of a digestible turn but still retain their Progressive roots and heavy melodies. ""Glyph"" has produced Floater's most popular songs in ""The Sad Ballad of Danny Boy,"" a humorous but raucous tale of a drunken Father and his family, and ""Cinema,"" a mind melting journey into the psyche of lead singer Robert Wynia. Both songs a sure crowd favorite in a live setting. Other stand out tracks include ""Clean Plastic Baby,"" a churning epic sized song, ""All the Stories But One,"" a real sing along tune, and ""Crawl Into You,"" arguably possessing Dave Amador's greatest guitar solo to date. Drummer Peter Cornett bellies up to the mic in a great acoustic ballad (that's him on the guitar as well) ""Bottle,"" another humorous but somehow dark tale of alcohol and it's controlling nature."
5,defentally a work of genisus.,Floater is one of the best rock bands of thir time. All I have to say is this is my fave. album but I still love angels.... and sink. joe
1,Immorally a waste of $$,"I purchased this not expecting much, which is to be expected if your into these types of films, but i do enjoy eroticy. There was nothing to enjoy about this one. I find it hard to believe that even those who like ""artsy erotic"" would enjoy this. constant panning of the camera & quick scene changes were very frustrating. Such as the young lovers on the beach, I was shown more of the beach, cliffs & waves than I was shown of the characters, and then it was just quick shots too ""up close"" orfrom too far away. Big disappointment!"
3,Interesting! Different!,"You need to concentrate on this movie to understand what is going on. There are allusions to historical people. OK, not the greatest movie I have seen."
2,Those weren't the days,"IMMORAL TALES is one of the bits of art-house erotica that's sure to fall short of pleasing modern audiences. It's ponderous sex-scenes are their own penance for those willing to sit through them, failing to hold much interest outside of exposed flesh and suggested depravities. There is little content here or drama for that matter, just boring sexual-tableaux, drawn out to feature length. The cinematography is occasionally interesting, but never truly captivates the eye beyond lensing exploitative elements of period dress being pulled of young ladies, in period settings."
1,Creates loose stickes and is very picky,I've had this sewing machine for a while but hate using it. It is very picky and the slightest thing seems to mess up the stitch. I can't even use it now because the stitches become loose every few inches and the adjustment to the tension doesn't make it any better. I would recommend not buying this product!
3,Dont know much about bought as a gift,"So I bought this for a family member, It looked ok, but it also looked boring absolutely not enough pictures in it... Im a visual person, need those picture to see what im preparing, Id never buy this cookbook for myself knowing it didnt have enough pictures"
2,Very disappointed,"I bought this book about a year ago and have tried several recipes in the book. Many meals are bland so you really have to make a lot of modifications to make them taste good, which probably increases the calories. Save your money."
5,Great Cookbook for Nutritious Eating,"I'm a little bit of a cookbook junkie, and I'm always on the lookout for cookbooks that emphasize healthy recipes with whole grains, good fats, and low sugar. This book meets and exceeds all those desires. So far, I have made several recipes, and all were delicious. Recipes that I have used have inspired me to experiment based on some of the interesting combinations presented--with great results. The soup and stew recipes are wonderful. I highly recommend this--especially if you have the fear that healthy eating will taste bad, because the recipes in this book will prove you wrong."
5,An excellent guide for those who really want to change their eating habits!,"This book is exactly what is needed for people who are committed to changing their eating habits. The contents are well organized, the logistics are clear, the recipes provide pertinent nutritional information, are easy to follow and give excellent results. As a physician that I am I will most certainly recommend it to patients and friends. Congratulations on the team work!"
5,Great healthy food ideas,I have made several of the receipes from this cookbook. All came out great. Instructions are easy to follow and the ingredients are healthy. I checked it out of the library before I bought it and now feel it was well worth the investment.
4,Tasty dishes,"Overall, I really like this cookbook. I was looking for new, exciting dishes that didn't pile on the calories. This certainly delivers. I've only made a handful of recipes but have yet to be disappointed."
2,Remembering Who We Are,I didn't think most of the questions in it made any sense to me at all. They didn't go along with the Big Book at all and so I didn't like it.. I I feel I have to be honest about my feelings about it. There's another workbook out that I liked much better.
3,Dakota-Nebraska history,"Good resource as a general history of the westward settlement, but disappointing as a genealogical resource... for me. As such, way too much to pay."
4,Great,"Great gadget. The only reason I gave it four stars is that the battery life is pretty poor. I highly recommend buying a battery charger for this while on the road, especially if you plan on taking pictures or voice recording."
2,Sony Refuses to Learn From Their Past Mistakes,"I was convinced that this device or its big brother the NZ90 would be the best thing since sliced bread for the student or businessman alike. Then I discovered Sony was up to its old proprietary tricks again by utilizing only their memory stick and no other method of storage such as the commonly used, less expensive, and easily procured CF or SD cards. When will Sony realize this type of marketing only reduces the number of sales and increases buyer animosity. Due to this tactic, I opted for the Toshiba and have not been disappointed yet."
1,Nope .....it didnt waste my time.,I started this movie and could tell within few minutes not to proceed. Looked cheesy and once I got annoyed so Quickly...I pulled the plug. Dont waste your time. My instincts know a turkey pretty quick and this one a Gobble Gobble within seconds.
2,"21 Eyes? Nope, just one big ""Nay"".","An 86 minute long movie that might have been tolerable if shortened to 5. As it is, you watch and listen to detectives endlessly sorting through multiple videos of a diamond robbery, to find out if the obvious (to me) suspect really is responsible for what happened. I can't say it's an awful movie, but it's one of those that from about the 10th minute on, I'm regretting having started it, since now I have the choice of watching something else and wondering if maybe some last minute twist would have made it worthwhile, or sticking with it and finding out I've wasted more time. Turns out to be the latter case. There were no reviews warning me not to waste my time. Now there is one for you. Don't bother. The 2 rating is only because I've seen some far worse movies."
2,A Big Disappointment,"I bought this book thinking it would be like its predecessor, Kokology 1. It wasn't anything close to the first book, not as exciting or as fact-revealing. I wouldn't recommend it."
2,Not as good as expected: Part 2,"PS Where was the passion? And the sexual tension? When I read a romance novel, I want to BE the heroine, because the hero is so great, because they're relationship and love is so great and beautiful that I wish it was happening to me. This didn't happen for me with this story. To tell the truth, I couldn't wait for it to end. The characters seemed wooden and lifeless. What's a romance novel without passion? Well, not much at all."
3,"Good show, but same old stuff.","My daughters love this show, but this is the third go-around of releasing the same material, this time with worse sound quality. Also, my set only came with two of the three discs."
5,hi five season2,I purchased this for my 15month old son. He has loved this show since forever... We used to watch it (my huby & I ) when we feed him so now he recognizes the voices and songs. I love to watch him dance and get so excited!
4,Never ordered it.,"Read this book years ago while living in the Interior of Alaska. It's an incredible read, but the price to purchase it is way too high. I'll consider it again one of these days. Thank you."
1,The very same mistake or scam hereLIPODERM,"The Jonni jordan cat lover mess happened to yours truly and my beautiful German Shepherd Stud ""Mecko""32 ounce orer 8 oz delivery,I cannot get thru for change either,just a little mess.Lipiderm"
4,In-breeding,This book shows why in-breeding in the Senior Management ranks doesn't work. David Ure scratching his privates in front of a female customer pretty much sums up the Senior Management attitude during the 90s.
1,Does not work on a 64 bit operating system- Windows Vista,"I am sure the game is great, but I was told I would have no problem playing it on my windows vista computer--HOWEVER--After several emails with the support website for this product, I come to find out that this game is NOT COMPATIBLE with WINDOWS VISTA 64BIT OPERATING SYSTEM...It might work if you have windows vista 32bit system???? Good luck!....Just be aware of what operating system you have!"
1,Sad,Wish they would make a NEW verison of this that would be compatible with something other than Windows XP and 98. We have Windows 7 and it doesn't run on it. Made my son really sad to not be able to play this game when he got it. The seller was awesome though and allowed me to return it. When my son HAD this game 3 years ago on his old computer he LOOOOOVED it and that is why we bought it again...then we realized its still the old version. So I WOULD give it a high rating (at least a 4 star) for playability and fun but because you can no longer play it on any current machine - it gets a 1 star rating from us.
2,Forget this poor piece of literature,"I have seen, read and used a lot of other books in my work as an Airport Consultant. This book is so ridiculously topical that it amazes me someone took the time and effort to publish it! It's so expensive as well. This book provides no answers at all to the problems surrounding strategic airport planning. The forecasting is weak and goes nowhere, the design parts have been done elsewhere and better than this book, the case studies are an exercise in adhocracy. The first rule in airport planning is not to use airport systems in developing countries as examples for they're built with no attention whatsoever to what is appropriate or what is needed. For a book that was supposed to help in planning airports, the authors have not planned this book out well at all, there is no fluidity whatsoever. I cannot see this book helping any airport planners or enthusiasts anywhere, I am bitterly disappointed at having purchased this book. I expected useful answers."
2,"Not their ""Live Best""","Do not buy this album. Akira's solos are sloppy and unimpressive, and the overall sound quality (of the band) isn't that great either. The recording doesn't ""flow"" because they have jumped around and taken just enough songs to fill only one disc. Maybe I'm just spoiled with the 8186 Live and Live, Loud, & Alive in Tokyo recordings, the latter being their best live disc ever."
2,Real tightwads shouldn't waste the money,"I cannot imagine that there are so many people who would put some of these suggestions to work. This book is definately for the cheapest of the cheap and not someone looking for easy ways to save a buck here and there on groceries, etc. The book is just a collection of articles sent in by readers on how they save money and some of them are just NUTS!! If you really want to save money just use some common sense and self-control and DO NOT waste good money on this book. I absolutely refuse to put together a list of what my children will need in terms of clothing for the next 100 years, complete with measurements of sizes and then show up at yard sales at 6am every Saturday in the summer. Unlike some, I consider the time consumed with these tactics to be worth more than a pair of $3 jeans from a yard sale that I will then save for 5 years or better and make all my kids wear them. Sorry for being so harsh, but I really do not like this book!"
2,Pretty extreme for most normal people,"If you think a good way to save $ is buy broken-down shoes for your kids at garage sales and feed your family 25 cent mac & cheese dinners this is for you. For the rest of us the majority of ideas here are a bit on the extreme side. She preaches about how much $ she saves by not working at home - yeah but she has to drive to all those garage sales, bulk stores and thrift shops.One telling comment was in the ""time is money"" chapter, ""Since we don't live near any relatives we don't spend [i.e. waste] time visiting all the time."" Oh but they do ""need"" a large house and antiques. This is an obsession, beyond normal thriftyness.If you're looking for realty-based info try Mary Hunt or Larry Burkett. The key is managing your $ properly - not dressing your kids like the cast from Annie."
4,Tightwad philosophy and practical tips at their best,"I have read all of Amy's books, and love her straight-forward philosophy on creative saving and the thrifty lifestyle. I have recommended this book to all my friends who are looking for new ways to save. Some people may find a few ideas in this latest book bordering on the extreme, such as ""dumpster-diving"". However, she explains that everyone has different comfort levels of tightwadding. The book contains so much practical and valuable information, it was well worth my money. I highly recommend it for the nouveau tightwad."
4,Good Old Fashoined Sense,"From her wise sense of investing time and money right to her real way with child rearing Amy Dacyczyn is doing something right. Teaching her children and her readers not to be wasteful is what it's all about. Sometimes I wish I was not allowed to push food around my plate - now I must re-educate myself and teach my own to value money, not give in to temptation when cruising down the grocery aisles and using all my resources wisely."
5,Superriffic Books in a set !!!!!,I've read all of those books and none of them have ever been stupid. And now it's in a set! I wish I could have them!True Floridian Bionicle Fan
3,Hmmm....,"While the overall Bionicle storyline is indeed good, I found the writing of this book itself to be...rather dry. It failed to suck me into the story, hardcore Bionicle fan though I am. Same with most of the other books, to be honest, although that could just be my own personal tastes talking."
5,Can't Ask for Anything More,"You can't expect anything more from a book on this subject. It is suitable for a beginner that doesn't know a thing about LaTeX, but also includes details on important advanced features like BibTeX and makeindex. Perhaps most importantly in the long run, the excellent index and detailed appendices make this a valuable reference. I use LaTeX all the time and this book is never far from my side!"
4,Word almost does everything LaTeX does...,"I bought this book a couple of months ago, planning to write my thesis using it. In the beginning, I could not comprehend what was going on. After a while, I started understanding it, but the number of times I needed to refer to the book even to do something simple exasperated me in no time. While it's true that the quality of the output is superlative to word processing packages, I wonder if it's worth the time you need to put into it. I had to spend nearly a hour just to change the margins on the page! MS Word began to look more and more attractive to me and I managed to get an automatic table of contents using the styles options in it. Maybe LaTeX will become easy, but right now, I am sticking with Word. The book is good, but the software itself is not all that useful in the present day context."
3,Good reference but poorly organized.,"Kopka and Daly do an excellent job covering the breadth of features found in LaTeX. Unfortunately, they try too hard to satisfy users of both the old and new system. This effort unnecessarily complicates an already complicated topic.They should have separated features from the old system into a separate section or a separate text."
5,The best book to start LaTeXing,"Searching for a good book to start using LaTeX is a challenge. Some books are just too advanced, focusing in programming and stuff, some are just a reference of commands with tips. Few books guide you through the process of ""designing"" a LaTeX document, making small steps from a simple text to a complete report, and this is a nice example.It is very well-written, and it is very easy to follow. With its exercises, it is just like a class about LaTeX. You start on a topic, say general formatting, and do some exercises to consolidate the ideas. Then you learn how to make lists, and do some exercises. Then you add equations, and practice. By the end of the book, you will have typed a nice amount of LaTeX code and will have learned almost every major topic.Even if you are a more advanced user, it is impossible not to learn something from this book. So go get it."
2,Badly organized,This book is badly organized: My doubts are often the best answer in Internet than in this book
1,Does not work...,I agree with the other review. This does not work. Even the instructions tell you to stand perfectly still to measure your pulse - absurd.
2,inconsistant readings,"I read the directions carefully for this pulse monitor, but repeatedly received inconsistent HR readings. it seems you have to have your finger positioned exactly right, and without so much as breathing for it to register correctly. I would not recommend this product for the purposes of obtaining a pulse reading."
2,Project stuff,It was weird to operate...I bought it for my son's project...it is flaky and some times does it's own thing...kids are using it as a toy now :(It served the purpose so it's all good
1,pulse monitor poor quality,"This piece is advertised as a pulse monitor, it really doesn't work well, I do not recomend it for anyone who wants to quickly check their pulse while excercising."
1,Stay Away,"DON'T PURCHASE, MY BABY STARTING CONVULSING AND A FULL BLOWN SEIZURE. This is a bad product and the grain alcohol and rosemary oil causes seizures in dogs. I gave this product to my perfectly healthy pug mix and in 7 hours he was on his death bed having convulsions and seizures. We had to rush him to the er. We are still waiting for his recovery as he is still having mild seizures. IF YOU DO BELIEVE THIS, TAKE YOUR CHANCES BUT DON'T SAY YOU WEREN'T WARNED. I AM IN HELL NOW WONDERING IF THE NEXT SEIZURE WILL TAKE HIS LIFE !"
1,Love with a twist,My dog loved the fruit flavored gel and it worked. Unfortuneatly it seems to have disappeared. Since he hates the salmon & peppermint guess we are back to plaque.
1,Container/Delivery system is terrible,"I've only used this a couple of times so I can't comment on how effective it is. Since others have covered that, my comments concern the container. It is very difficult to get the product out of the bottle without ending up with too much or too little product.A different type of container for something this thick is strongly needed.If you want to use it, get the spray and not the gel, so you won't have this issue.Update: By the third use, my dog fights me completely on using this. I suspect it's the alcohol content since she has never objected to having her teeth brushed with other products. I do not recommend this."
1,Petlife Dental Oral Care Gel,"This product smells so highly of alcohol that I'm afraid to use it on my little dog. I would like to return it, but am not sure I have all the info to return it."
2,Not up to expectations,"I am a committed cat tooth brusher, but even so, tartar develops. I got this for one of my cats who had mild buildup on his top teeth. I hoped it would save a tooth cleaning. I dutifully applied it once a day (you can do it twice and that may have made a difference, but he is no dummy and once a day was all we could manage!). You have to do it at least 30 minutes before or after a meal. I used more than a bottle in a test period of about 2 months. At the end of that time, I saw no change whatsoever. He just got back from his dental yesterday. I will work harder on brushing and skip this product."
5,This really works,Pet Life tooth gel works well and my vet said it was ok to use it. I bought it at amazon. my dogs teeth are much better.
3,Not for my cat...BURNS!,"I have an elderly cat that has had her teeth cleaned before, but is now too old to undergo the process. I tried this, but she hates it. I asked a vet and he said from psychological standpoint, probably more traumatizing for her than the effects would be beneficial. She's really old and has trouble chewing dry hard food, but figure at her advanced age, better to not freak her out every couple days trying to get on her face for her to lick off. IF your pet doesn't mind it though, worth a try. Just an fyi, I did notice that when I had some on my finger as I was trying to catch her to get on her, after a minute or two, this BURNED! Maybe that's one of the reasons she didn't like."
1,DON'T BUY THIS! MY DOG ALMOST DIED FROM IT!,"Please do not buy this! I gave the recommended dosage to my 20lb dog for 2 days and she became violently ill! The vet said it was a reaction from this product. She became so sick very quickly and would have died if we did not rush her to the vet. I wrote the company to let them know about this and all they said to me is ""you cannot return this product if it was is used!"" Good thing they care about pets and about selling products that may be toxic! Please DO NOT use this product or buy from these horrible people if you care about your pets lives!"
3,Pet Dental,"I tried this product but as a gel it is very difficult to administer as an oral care for my pet dog. It requires that it be refrigerated which makes the gel version a lot thicker. It may be better to use the oral liquid version which can be easily administered as a spray.The ads and the description indicate that within a month the plaque on my pets teeth will start to disappear. Although I have had the gel version for about two weeks now is too soon to say in terms of results. The gel, when applied, does not adhere to the teeth and either gets dispelled by my pet or he ""licks it up"" and swallows which prevents a direct application.I'm still optimistic that this is a better alternative than traditional veterinary methods of teeth cleaning which require, and at great safety risk, to have the pet anesthetized. There is always a risk that the pet may not survive this method which is why I chose the gel application.John, NYC"
1,BEWARE SMALL DOG OWNERS!!,"I have to warn small dog owners about using this product without researching the ingredients. Yes, it is all natural but did you know that rosemary oil can be lethal to small dogs? It can cause seizures. Our mini dachshund had a full blown seizure within a week of starting this product. PLEASE, for your friends sake, do not use this product until you read the warnings on using herbal oils in dog treatments or food. I cannot prove that this product caused the seizure but the dog has had no such episodes in his four years of life. He is healthy and full of life. I will not continue using this product on my dogs after reading the effects and dangers of essential oils, specifically rosemary oil, in dog treatments and food. Essential oils are much too concentrated and are nothing like the whole plant. A drop of essential oil is 100 times stronger than a pinch of the herb plant. This product may work great but I will not risk my pet's well being for the sake of a quick fix."
1,Petzlife salmon gel disappointed,"Bought Petzlife salmon gel about a month ago. I've used it on my 2 yr old mini doxie faithfully. She's a rescue dog who is blind and deaf the dentist wanted to clean her teeth for around $600.They weren't that bad so I looked for an alternative and found Petzlife..I had already been brushing her teeth 2-3 times a week. So this sounded great..Maybe it's because her teeth weren't as bad as the other dogs commented on here..but I've seen no improvements. What plaque she had she still has. The light redness of her gums is still there. And she hate her brushing just as much as she always did..and this stuff is hard to get out of the bottle...and sinks..I smell NO SALMON smells, what I do smell is a harsh chemical smell.So far I feel as if I've wasted a lot of money..sad to say. So if I could I've give it a thumbs down. Will I buy this product again that's a big NO!"
2,Dog hates it,Dont know how well it works as my dog hates the taste - the salmon oil - its a fight to brush= so have been inconsistent. May try a different flavor.
1,My dog HATES PetzLife Oral Care Gel with Wild Salmon,"I don't know if PetzLife Oral Care Gel with Wild Salmon oil works or not, because putting it on my dog's teeth is problematic. She'll let me brush her teeth, but she really HATES PetzLife Oral Care Gel with Wild Salmon oil. After putting it on, she snorts, sputters and sneezes. It's not worth upsetting her so much. And my dog loves fish, which is why I got the salmon flavor."
3,This really does smell like Salmon,"Pros:* PetzLife Oral Care Gel isn't new to me. this is a product I have been using for a while now with my dog, one that has been doing wonders to his dental situation. I am very pleased with this.* It cleans in a way no other product could, at least in my opinion and past experiences.Cons:* This salmon oil kind is.. really salmon oil. You know that scent at the fish aisle at the grocery store? Now imagine brushing your pets teeth with that scent.* Although my dog would kill for some tuna, he didn't like this.* The scent is really strong and stays there for a long time. It doesn't get betterBottom line:I do recommend PetzLife Oral Care Gel- I highly recommend it.But I recommend that you'd go for the peppermint one. Your pet might not like it, but it's just one second and you'd appreciate the scent much more."
5,A MUST HAVE for small dogs...or cats,"This is the best. Gel works better than the sprays. Salmon flavor is better than mint for my dogs....and I am sure cats would like it better too. I have used it for three or four years, and have SAVED my dogs teeth, as well as preventing decay and bad gums!!And their breath is much better too!! Easy to use and lasts a long time. Forget the other expensive stuff...tried it...does not work.Janet, ...two chahuahuasps The Vet I went to before trying this said ChaCha needed MOST of her teeth pulled.....I never went back."
5,Easy peazy!,"My groomer recommended this product for my 15-year-old border collie. She said to just put some on my finger and smear it on her front teeth and she would lick it and distribute it all over her mouth. After I figured out I had to turn the bottle upside down and shake it down and then squeeze it out, I tried it a couple of times. She didn't like me messing with her mouth and I didn't like it either, but she seemed to like the taste Ok. Since you don't have to put it directly on all the teeth I decided to just take a soup spoon and squeeze the required amount into it and let her lick it off the spoon. She licked it off with no problem and after a week I saw no more brown on her teeth. The literature says it is safe for humans and I'm going to order some mint flavored for me!"
2,Eww,"I have a Yorkshire Terrier. I try to brush her teeth every day or 2 (yorkies are very prone to tooth decay), but she fights me pretty hard. I bought this thinking I might be able to cut back a bit. I thought it being salmon oil she might even like it. She HATES it. I can't say that I blame her it smells kind of minty... She actually fights me more just rubbing this on her teeth than she does brushing them. It may do wonders for some, but I think well just keep brushing."
2,cleaner teeth?,"I have seen no improvement in the appearance of my dogs' teeth after using the product for 2 to 3 weeks. It says it will help 30 days, so after 75% of that time I would expect to see some improvement and I don't. I won't buy it again."
4,Cleaner toowoofs!,"I think that this product has helped to keep my dog's teeth cleaner. Dachshunds have very bad problems with plaque, however, Madison's ""smile"" has greatly improved, since starting PetzLife Oral Care Gel - Wild Salmon Oil. For best results, store in the fridge!"
1,Didn't get what was advertised,"According to what I read there would be a 33 oz.box, 15/carton. I received the smallest box of Tide there is. And only one, 15/carton normally means 15 boxes in a carton. Very disappointed, I"
3,short but good,I picked this up on accident but it wasn't a bad find. I have never really listened to this type of music but the more I did the more it grew on me. But the reason I gave it three stars is because even though the music isn't bad the cd is only around 27 min long... I mean come on... for the price I should at least get more than just 27 min
4,"different, but don't just push it away","Many kids who are in the scene have a distinct disliking of what Victory does to bands (CBK comes to mind), but the latest release of With Honor should be an exception to this rule. Yes, most people consider their old EPs and Heart Means Everything to be classics in the modern hardcore scene but they shouldn't frown on This Is Our Revenge. Whereas the band does take on a far more melodic rhythm than on their previous albums, and making similarities between them and the numerous melodic hardcore acts of the mid-90s (Good Riddance, Kid Dynamite, think Jade Tree) wouldn't be wrong, I don't feel that they have completely lost their edge. With Honor are merely just showing what else they can do and are trying to change things up in a scene that is becoming very large but quite stagnant at the moment. Check out the songs Plot Two and Closets"
4,Solid positive hardcore,"This is just a solid positive hardcore record from a really good band. This Is Our Revenge doesn't retain a lot of the aggressive aspects of Heart Means Everything but theirs very little to complain about here. It's catchy, heartfelt, and actually has something positive to say. Given the current state of hardcore, this is such a breath of fresh air. There is defintely a bit of a Comeback Kid feel to this album, but some of the other comparisons from Victory are pretty off base (go figure). The only reason it says this album is for fans of Thrice on the sticker is becuase this album dropped on the same day as Vheissu and theres really nothing similar to Rise Against. If you enjoy the likes of Comeback Kid and Bane, then this record is for you. Highlight tracks include ""Elevens,"" ""Closets,"" ""You Always Said,"" and ""In A Bottle"" which has an undeniable Boysetsfire feel to it."
1,upsetting,"well considering how incredibly awesome with honor used to be this album made me want to cry. pretty much all that im reading on these reviews is excuses. they moved to victory and changed their sound to be more mainstream, i even saw them on a commercial with atreyu, man that pissed me off. buy this album if you want to sit around and listen to some crappy forced guy singing in a watered down version of a hardcore band. if you want to listen to some good hardcore get their first album."
1,Mc Aleese's Fighting manual,"This book is a shocking example of a manual. A clear waste of time, ha books these days! Don't buy it. It does not give you any explanation of CQB in real circumstances like the Iranian Embassy Seige. No Mp5's or color pics. No tips on getting fit for selection. Not for millitary experts! Run away!¬ø¬ø¬ø¬ø¬ø{PROFESSOR PETER GEOINGEHAN}?????"
3,WearEver BackPack Lounger,"I bought this chair for myself but, ended up giving it to my daughter. My daughter loves it. The good things are it's sturdy, the back is adjustable and it has a foot rest. The bad things are it's heavy to carry on your back, it is not at all a wide chair (to small), I had a hard time getting it off my back once I got it on. Just not my cup of tea I guess. All in all it's a good chair and will last a long time."
1,STICKERS....REALLY???,"I also wish that I would have read the reviews before purchasing this toy. I plan to return it immediately. Not only are the character stickers disappointing from a quality standpoint (some of my stickers were upside down or completely missing) but they are dangerous from a safety standpoint. I also thought the activity cube would have been a little larger. This toy is the worst $50 I have ever spent - I usually do not write reviews, but felt compelled to share my disappointment with fellow unsuspecting buyers."
2,This toy is not child-safe,"I recently bought this toy for my 1 year old triplets. They love it. It is a great toy conceptually, but there is a major quality/safety problem. All of those characters that you see in the picture are stickers, instead of painted on. They are stickers like you would find at a dollar store. Not special, extra sticky stickers, just plain, cheap stickers. In a word, cheap. My little boy played with this toy for 10 mins before I found a sticker on the couch. These stickers are just the right size for blocking the windpipe of the child for whom this product claims to be appropriate. I had considered trying to glue the stickers or find a way to make them permanent, but there is no way to do that without making the toy toxic to teethers. I am very disappointed in this product. I should have just bought the parents brand one at Target. It's not as neat, but at least they could play with it. Now I have a $50 toy that my kids can't play with. **Find something else**"
2,Not worth the money,"I bought this toy for my 9 month old daughter. Little did I know that all the pieces that move are decorated with Sesame Street stickers and not painted. As a result the second we opened the box, the stickers started falling off. Every time my daughter plays with it, more fall off and then she puts them in her mouth!Also, the top is made to come off for easy storage. Yes, this makes it easy to store, but the top never stays on! My daughter will sometimes grab the top while she's off-balance and the whole top comes off and she falls.I was very disappointed with this product."
3,Cute...,I actually bought this for my son that is 6 months old but my 3 year old daughter plays with it a whole lot more then him i know he is a little young for it now but i was really surprise this gets her attention and plays with it for hours. My newphew and niece also love it and they are 1 and 2 1/2 yrs. I did have to glue gun the stickers on so they don't fall off because i did loose 2 of them already and had it for only a week. But for the time and enjoyment my daughter gets out of it it is worth the price and little trouble i had to go through with the stickers.
1,CAUTION!!!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS TOY!!!,I cannot believe this toy is still being sold. It is 100% unsafe. I'm contacting the manufacturer today. My 8 month old daughter was able to peel off and ingest one of the stickers within the 30 seconds she was alone. She was gagging & threw up. Since she's been sick we thought it was her normal puke. But she didn't seem able to to catch her breath. SO I checked her airway and sure enough there was something in there. I was able to get it out- PRAISE GOD! It was one of the stickers off of this toy. She can't even get baby mum-mums in her mouth every time but she got this. Very unsafe. Pleas be careful if you already own this and do not buy it if you don't!!!!!
2,Choking Hazard,"Do NOT buy this item. It may be cute, but it is a choking hazard. The characters are stickers- they are not painted on. When we took the item out of the box, half of the stickers had fallen off. We pealed most of the other ones off so my son does not get them. I was very disappointed as I was looking forward to this item. I found a nicer one at Toys R us- a wooden jungle theme. Great colors and no stickers."
4,Great toy 1 year old loves it!,"I know the problems with the stickers and was aware of it when I purchased this. It is great, The little one loves it--yes the sticker are shedding like the leaves of fall but it hasnt reduced the fun factor a bit!"
5,Nikon lens hood for CP5000,"Great construction, original Nikon and made in Japan no less. What more can I say."
3,Good wireless mouse..but there are better ones cheaper now,"I purchased this product in a package of 4 for a reasonable price. However, with almost all Microsoft products there are good points and bad points. I use the mouse with my desktop and laptop. One annoyance is that the warning""Low Battery"" constantly appears on the screen when Nothing is wrong with the battery strength. There are better mouses out there for a cheaper price."
5,Night-night,"I've long used valerian root as a sleep aid. I am especially happy with Restful Zzz's. I am confident that the product truly contains valerian root. I have had trouble in the past with cheap, no-name brands that seem to have diluted the valerian or even packaged a lie. My body knows the difference.Valerian root has a distinctive odor - akin to dirty gym socks. I have used some valerian supplements in the past that forced my husband from the room when I took them. No joke. This one is different. They've somehow managed to tone it down. I can't explain it. Perhaps it is the capsules or a new preparation. No valerian supplement will be odor-free. But this one comes close.I'm sticking with Restful Zzzz's because it does the job without the smell. The price is reasonable for a therapeutic dose and I love the convenience of Amazon prime. And before I found it on Amazon, the health-food store employees instantly recognized ""Restful Zzzz's"" when I asked and recommended it highly."
3,Enjoyable Russian Animation,"I purchased this video in order to expose my children (ages 4 and 6) to the Russian language. They watched this video many times and seemed to enjoy it. This is a collection of several older animations. One of the animations has some Soviet propaganda but, otherwise, they seem okay. There is very little violence in this story about three children resisting the German occupation of their town. The Red Army then comes to save the day. The German soldiers are portrayed as comical and inept. The other stories seem fairly apolitical, however."
4,daily use,"We bought 5 of these remotes, we use them to buzz the door at our buiseness. This remote is a great durable product, we found that after about a year of daily use the buttons get harder to press"
1,Stick with the classic!!!!,"I had the Philips Webtv/plus unit before I ""upgraded"" to this piece of junk. The keyboard is the biggest problem,it misses keystrokes ALOT, The new OK button is in the same spot the scroll down button used to be in. Websites download a little faster, but not fast enough to bother changing if you have a classic webtv unit. And you can acsess a few more sites that you could'nt before, also not worth changing over. You can watch wmv files now, but you lose the ability to download zip files. It took me 10 times as long as it should have to type this review, I have to go back and add all of the letters the keyboard missed. Don't buy unless you have excessive amount of patience."
1,You will be sorry if you do,"This is not a device to make your life simple or getting on line without a computer easy. This is not a $100 upgrade from the old WEBTV, this is simply Bill Gates form of ""consumer 3 card monte"" to force folks into purchasing a computer. If you think you have problems now, just purchase one of these devices, follow the simple instructions and watch the headaches mount. This little contraption has enough gliches and booboos to scare the pants off of any seasoned computer pro. If you are used to the old webtv, believe me this thing is a nightmare. If you are new to using the internet, well just purchase a computer. The old webtv is being fazed out ad is next to impossible to purchase! I don't believe that the richest guy in the world would put out a product with so many horrors and hangups without some hidden agenda!"
5,mtv 2,"I'm enjoying my MTV 2. It has been recycled meaning used. Only one problem, but firstit was the best deal. The people at MTV 2 are soooooooooooo helpful. The only thing i didn'tlike was MTV 2 did not get all of the other persons info out of it. Now, I'm trying to getinto facebook and I have to call MTV 2 again. Other wise it is GREAT.BArb"
1,Disgusted with MSNTV2!!,"I bought MSNTV2 in 2004.I was more than happy with it.But over the years as computers improved and websites got better and faster, MSNTV2 couldn't handle it.MSNTV2 was created with Flash.6. Most websites today require Flash 9 or 10. Which means MSNTV2 has become old and outdated. It is very difficult to access websites anymore (the unit freezes) and forget streaming video like U Tube. Since there is no hard drive they can NOT upgrade it. Most of customers that have used it for years are very unhappy. It remains fine for emails and photos BUT NOT for much else. The yearly fees are $120 on top of your internet hook-up."
1,NOT A GOOD CHANGE!,"They stated the new MNS TV 2 would work fasterand that one would be able to do more with itthan the Web TV Classic; however, it does muchless than Web TV.I never had any problem at all with the Web TVand never had to phone for help or thing goingwrong with it; however, with the new MSN TV 2things are going wrong constantly and I haveto call. When one calls you have too waita really long time before you can even speakto someone. Then they do not seem to understand what one is trying to tell themwhat is wrong with it.STAY WITH YOUR WEB TV. YOU WILL BE HAPPIER!!"
2,Misleading info given on MSNTV2,I ordered this item for my homebound uncle to play games on the internet. I called the 800 number and spoke to a representive and he assured me that pogo.com was an option and capatable with this product. IT IS NOT. You have to have a JAVA to play these games.The game sites that allow you to play are not very person oriented. All we found only allowed him to play by himself. Well a Playstation 2 worked just as well and cheaper since not have to pay the MSN fee every month.Wish I had never purchased this product. My uncle used it 1 week and was ok for him to surf net but not play games which was why we wanted it. Would not have been upset if company rep not told me was ok with pogo and slingo.com Lost all respect for MSN.
4,Good for browsing,this works great. i haven't had problems like others clam to have. the only reason i don't need it anymore is i use aim more then msn. since this unit doesnt accept downloads aim and yahoo cant be added. i ended up getting windows xp full version since my ME crashed. its not a bad product. it gets 4 stars only cuz you cant download or update things like flash. if you dont want to spend a ton of money for a 2nd or 3rd computer for only $9.95/month (assuming you have high speed already) its a good alternative. thats what i used it for. 1 more important thing. there are a couple usb ports on the back. you can hook up a usb mouse to it if you like to click on things rather then use the remote.
4,whats all the fuss?,"I have had the new msntv2 since it came out, yes it was frustrating a little at first and I hated losing the pip and the scrapbook, but I dont understand people saying the things it wont do. I write email everyday on it, I cut copy paste without a mouse, perhaps some of these people just need a little more patience, give up my msntv2 NO WAAAAY. The main reason I like it is that I do not speak ""computereeze"" and so I dont have anything to compare it to, I did start out in the 80's with a Commodore 64 but thats another story. I started on webtv in '98 with the original classic and have progressed from there to the msntv2, of which I am on my 2nd one in 4 years but the nice thing is whenever I do have to change units, I have everything saved and appearing on the new unit and I can buy these new units at discounted prices thru amazon or ebay. I AM VERY HAPPY WITH MY MSNTV2."
4,Much Better Than the Old System!,"I upgraded to the MSNTV Player recently because I neeed to access certain websites that the old Webtv receiver couldn't do.I wasn't disappointed when I hooked the new system up.Navigating most websites is much more easier & it doesn't take a eternity to load.I was hesitant to purchase this unit at first,but now it was well worth it."
1,"AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL PRODUCT","How does Microsoft tout this product as broadband ready and get away with it? A few years ago, I purchased the original MSNTV for my mother. She was pretty excited to upgrade to MSNTV2 and after seeing all of MSN's commercials and promotions in-stores like Circuit City, I decided to buy MSNTV2 for her for Christmas. Nowhere in any of the commercials and nowhere in any of the materials I received from the Circuit City rep did it mention that an existing PC network was required to allow MSNTV2 to utilize broadband/DSL. As a standalone, MSNTV2 is not compatible for broadband. This was very deceptive on MSN's part not to adequately disclose this. In addition to the broadband compatibility issues, the new HP printer I purchased for original MSNTV was no longer compatible, even though it is a relatively new printer. Last but now least, MSNTV2 as a dial up option is much slower than the original MSNTV. I repeat, MSNTV2 is an AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL PRODUCT"
1,DEFECTIVE NIGHTMARE !!!,"item defective, returned to amazon.com for a refund ... have ordered a new MSNTV2, hopefully this one will work ??? ... (...)... in the meantime, i purchased a new WEBTV PLUS, it's useless !!! ... my next option is to purchase a ""real"" computer !!! ..."
3,"Unit does some things well, but too many problems and bugs.","The keyboard interface does not function well. As most of the buyers have reported here, it skips letters, and is impossible to use for writing emails or other text (like this) without constant fixing.As a multimedia unit it has severe limitations as well, not being able to access many popular video and audio files if they are not Microsoft.No ability to do CCP from web pages, though if you buy a mouse you can do it...sometimes. Scroll feature on mouse not enabled.The MSN TV 2 does surf faster than the old Web TV did, even on dial up, though display of some webpages is eccentric.Photo features a scrapbook which is limited to 100 low resolution pictures. With the addition of a card reader, digital memory cards can be read and images printed.BTW, I am on my second unit, the first one was so faulty I couldn't even register it.In summary, this unit is not at all ready for market. Caveat emptor."
5,I LOVE IT!,"I love MSNTV, this unit is not as good as the old Plus Units that unfortunately aren't being made anymore but it is still good for people who don't care that there are certain things you can't do with this that you can do on a computer but it's still a fun way to access the internet through your TV. BTW: don't believe the review from the guy who owns an Macintosh Apple computer that they can't be infected by viruses. as A former Apple computer owner I can say that isn't true and I lost my computer due to those pesty viruses. Any computer that has a hard drive can be infected by viruses but what's great about this MSNTV is that it can't be infected by viruses at all."
4,Better than earlier Model,"I ordered this MSN TV2 Internet and media player for my mother who refuses to use either of my two computers because of difficulty in seeing the screen. She had the earlier model which she sold when she moved in with me. I installed this model so that she'd be able to view the screen on my 34inch TV. I was impressed with the newer version which seems to move from screen to screen quicker than the earlier model. Mother doesn't like it because she can't make out the white lettering on the blue function keys. I still feel this is a superior model, so I give it a four. I have a feeling when I get it moved into her room, she'll be more impressed with it."
1,"Inadequate, Outdated","I have had a Webtv for about 10 years. The oudated browser was no longer able to handle the rapidly changing new websites. With great anticipation, I got this unit.What a letdown. I get constantly told by e-mail from MSN what a great unit this is, but I don't see it. I would recommend one get a netbook computer unless one is satisfied with the adequate e-mail and spotty website manipulation of this unit. You can do a search, find what you would like to investigate, and then find out this unit will not enter the website.Summary: If you just want to do e-mail and gamble on entering and navigating a website, or following a search, fine. Otherwise, you will be disappointed."
1,"HEED THE WARNINGS, FOLKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","My original Web TV unit finally gave out after 7 years, so I replaced it with MSN TV 2, despite reading more than a few negative reviews here. Biggest consumer mistake I've ever made. Heed the warnings, folks, they are not lying! First my email account didn't exist for several days. Videos WILL NOT PLAY unless you have high speed service, which I don't. In fact, the screen just freezes up and you must unplug the unit and reconnect any time you try this. The screen freezes up CONSTANTLY, in fact, whether you are trying to do ANYTHING. What a nightmare. Tech support was very helpful, I can't complain there at all. But after awhile, you just get sick of the problems and surrender. I sent it back, got a refund, and bought a REAL laptop computer."
4,I am very pleased,"I have used webtv-msntv for the last 7 1/2 years. And just switiched to the msntv2 unit last month when my new msntv classic died after a year and a half. Sure at first wanted nothing to do with the msntv2 because I had heard of the problems people were having with it when it was first released.I am glad that I changed my mind.Right now I am using the dial connection which is still faster than it was with the other two units.I also like the e-mail set up better,among other things,Sure it still has growing pains but what doesn't!And the unit is updated, So if you are not a computer person.Why not give this unit a try As of January 4th 2009 after so many years of owning Webtv products I finally bought the new Macbook. If it had not been for owing the webtv/msntv 2 the transition would not have been so easy. There are things that I will continue to use the msntv2 for but the Macbook will be my main unit, They both are now connected to dsl."
1,HORRIBLE,"FOUR WORDS ""DO NOT BUY IT"" AFTER YEARS OF WORKING ON MACS AND PC AND OWNING 2 OTHER WEBTVs I CAN HONESTLY SAY THIS THING HAS MORE FLAWS THAN I CARE TO COUNT AND IT IS GOING BACK OR THROUGH A WINDOW AFTER THREE DAYS."
1,NOT...GOOD !,I am returning my msntv2 unit for a full refund...it doesnt live up to the expectations of the phillips webtv plus unit I had that was destroyed in a power storm...I wish they were not bought out and still made these wonderful units that I could take my family videos and freeze frame pics to relatives...with this unit you cannot. Also it seems you could do more with the webtv plus than with this unit. I have to give the msntv 2 unit a very poor rating. I wish these companies would realize that sometimes newer is not always better !
1,very good,"I have connected the web tv box up to try it and it works, it's my back up so it's my spare box."
5,"Product in good condition, came fast",The product was as described (except for a remote that the seller added just to be nice) and came fast and in excellent condition. Best customer service you could ask for.
1,A Total WASTE Of Money!,"Let's see....$206 for the unit......$300 for a years subscription to MSNTV....$506. For that much money, you can find yourself a pretty decent COMPUTER. And you'll wish you had, because this thing is painfully limited and the ""tech support"" is pretty much non-existent.Bill Gates has got himself a real ""cash cow"" in this thing!"
5,Webtv Is awesome!,"Hi everyone,I am sorry that everyone is just giving good and bad reviews about the webtv anymore. I used to be one back when it first came out and also had my computer. I loved both of the services. I just ordered this one because I recently miss my webtv. So I think webtv is an awesome product for anyone in the world. It is for people that dont want to sit at a desk all day and just do the internet on their couch, hey, i do it, I will not complain. I work at my computer 24-7 and sometimes it annoys me. So that is why I cant wait to get the new MSNTV. MSN is an awesome service I have it for my computer and cant wait to get it for my tv, especially with broadband, it is going to be much more of an experience."
4,Inspirational Sparks,"One should read this collection of essays, not for answers to the great philosophical questions in art, but for inspiration. Mulvey's polemics, filled with unsupported assertions and often strange conclusions, are not philosophically sound. These essays, however, are provocative and one cannot help but respond, either in sympathy or in rejection to her works. A risk taker, she gives birth to ideas that have transcended the boundaries of third-wave feminist criticism and have found their way into mainstream theory. Mulvey is a must read for feminist theorists and critics in the visual, literary, theatrical and filmic arts."
3,ok,"This product works like it says it does, but is not very useful because by the time you hang a recycled garbage bag on it, and start to fill it up, it hangs too low. The cupboard door won't close."
1,E-Z Trash Bag Holder,"I was very disappointed with the E=Z Trash Bag. I didn't even try to put it up because you only receive (ONE) so it seems impossible to hang bags correctly to put trash in it. I think you would need two, one for each side of the door. Before I ordered it the instructions were terrible. I had to pay more in shipping that the item or I would ship it back. I think that has fixed me on internet shopppingl Joyce"
2,Save your money for more SkypeOut minutes,"A generally well-written book, but offers few nifty insights to save more money or get more service. Look, download Skype and start using it; if you want to go beyond what's obvious from simple use, google will have what few insights are out there; no book will offer a wealth of tips because Skype isn't that kind of produce/service. Secret commands or ""hacks"" just don't exist for Skype.And why does the author put that bizzare tip on how to physically cut your phone lines??The one thing I really wanted to have more info on--how to integrate Skype long distance into your existing home phones with Skype's products under Shop->Accessories--the book barely mentioned as Option 1 of several. Very little help."
1,"Have a Fireplace?, Need Kindling?, Buy This Book.","I previously owned a 1987 626 GT, which was meticulously maintained and am currently driving a relatively pristine specimen of a 1989 MX-6 GT. Based upon my experience with and knowledge of each of these vehicles, this publication can help no one who owns a post-1988 626/MX-6. In 1989 the 626 coupe was completely redesigned into the 1st generation MX-6 with minimal parts interchange... A fact that appears to have completely escaped the author(s). If you like reading about the inner workings of a vehicle you don't own, then buy this book. The 1983 thru 1988 info. may be accurate. However, 1989 should have been left out because the information provided is completely unapplicable to the car. I wasted money and hours of frustration. I refuse to consider the purchase of another these publication."
1,save a tree-don't buy this book!!!!!,"i is a mcanic is not good at ficsin stuf. Waste of Money!!! This book is useless at best, Try using the schematics in the back. My 1990 626 must be an orphan, or a pontiac in drag. If they didn't shrink wrap it i would have taken it back. Too basic for a mechanic & too inaccurate for a novice."
1,Useless,"I own a '91 Mazda MX-6 and bought this book to help with the minor repairs it needed, the electrical diagrams in this book are not even compairable to the wiring in the vehicle as well as the fact that the rest of the data is incorrect, I wish I'd bought a better looking paper weight."
5,One Book You Won't Easily Forget,"Anyone who has ever pondered the question of ""Nature vs Nurture"" and found compelling arguements on both sides will come away still wondering the ""truth"" after reading this novel. Be warned this book is very graphic in nature, but if you can stomach it, this is a book you will not easily forget. Leave it to Cormac McCarthy to write a novel so grotesquely original in subject that you will find yourself locked in until the very last page. Only such a talented and superb author can create a character so hainous and dispicable and in the telling of his story can make the reader feel a strange sense of compassion for him at the end. This book is a must read for all McCarthy fans."
3,Necromaniacs Rejoice!,"Ever hear of Ed Gein? If not this book will be a suprise to you. I was recommended Child of God by a friend. What is at first a simple story about an awful, troll-like man living in a shack becomes a story about an awful, troll-like man who loses his shack and goes to live in a cave, which soon becomes a kind of harem where he keeps the corpses of his dead lovers. You guessed it, necrophilia. With Mccarthy's typically poetic verse, the story is made all the more unsettling with great dashes of prentension thrown in. It's not his best, and suffers from the same problems I typically find in Mccarthy's work. It's a bit boring at times. The above noted pretension is laid on pretty thick - so many incomplete sentences. Certainly not a book for everyone, but certainly one worth a look if you're a Mccarthy fan or someone just into reading about dispicable necromaniacs. Hey, whatever floats your boat."
3,Child of God,"This book is not for the easily offended or a young audience. While reading this novel, I was shocked yet could not put it down. The main character, Lester Ballard, is disturbing but somehow the author makes the reader have empathy for him. VERY SHOCKING and DISTURBING!"
4,Child of Mean,"As always, this writer transports you to a vicious world and the reader becomes immersed in it, and somehow fascinated by nasty characters devoid of morals, and the killing reads like poetry."
3,It's allright,"The book was depressing, but did not have as much impact on me as The Road. To put is bluntly, it's like reading about the daily life of a mentally challenged sociopath. Not very exciting."
3,OK but not great,"I found the writing compelling but the characters...not so much. The main character is a study in the debased human character that may lie dormant in most of us, but not so much that I can relate to anything he does nor to any thoughts he may have. So, I can only theoretically and academically relate to the main character. Whereas, ""The Road"" had me thinking for days."
3,good book,"i didn't like it as much as The Road, but i still thought it was pretty good. Sometimes i got a little lost as to who was speaking, narrator vs character, but the ""story"" was good."
2,Where's McCarthy?,"Although a fan of McCarthy, this was an overall disappointment. At his best, McCarthy can create a sense of space that almost makes you dread turning the next page. Not so here. Try Blood Meridian, Outer Dark, Border Trilogy for McCarthy at his bes."
3,Where's the Nobel Prize?,"Poor old Cormac. He read Faulkner and saw where Faulkner won the Nobel Prize. He said, I can do that. So he wrote Outer Dark which his version of Light in August.(Woman traipsing around the country trying to find somebody) Then he wrote Child of God which is his version of As I Lay Dying.(Use of pronouns and stream of consciousness to keep the reader confused) But a funny thing happened on the way to the Nobel Prize. He ain't got one. Now, don't git me wrong. I ain't sayin Cormac can't write. He writes damn good. But I am sayin that he ain't original. A copy of Faulkner ain't Faulkner.Eddy Arnold"
2,Childish story,A very simple read but a very simple story also. sort of shocking but not by todays standards
1,too strange for me...,"This book was too weird for me, it was just too graphic. I read it only because it has caused a controversy in an area school. The teacher that allowed his student to read this book has now been fired. I know that I don't want my own kids to read this book. Mr. McCarthy has done much better with his other works."
1,Peter Smith hardcover WARNING!!!,"If you're considering buying the Peter Smith ""edition"" of this book, note that it is NOT a new ""edition"" in hardcover but the Vintage International edition rebound in red cloth, with the cover of said trade paperback glued onto the front. It looks like it's been rebound for libraries, is the type of thing that's usually not for sale to the general public (. . .) The book is WELL-REBOUND, and may still be worth it to you Cormac McCarthy diehards out there -- it is for me, and ultimately I'm just gonna keep the copy of it I bought, but it's still quite disappointing. Thought you deserved a warning, hope it came in time. McCarthy's a great writer, of course -- feel a little guilty about the one-star, but it's an issue of the edition, not the book."
1,Not my taste.,I found this author coarse & rambling. Subject matter disturbing with no point or redeeming qualities. I really wish I had not bought this book.
5,Intense and disturbing,"This is a gripping novel that probes the breadth of human depravity and perversity while plunging the reader into a malevolent and sinister world. Lester Ballard is a deeply deranged and demented individual with sexually perverse lusts that resides in the Eastern Tennessee countryside. He's accused of rape, imprisoned for a short time, then released after which he commits unspeakable acts against his fellow man. It's doubtful his incarceration had anything to do with his behavior since it's obvious from the start this man is troubled. This is a wonderful novel filled with effective imagery and stunning descriptiveness. I found the chapter where the town sheriff, deputy and old Mr. Wade rowing the boat through the flooded town streets to be quite interesting. A recommended book, but beware the subject matter is quite graphic and might not be suitable for those without strong stomachs."
2,Where's The Story Plot! Is This Guy From Deliverance???,"Bought this book based on some good reviews and hoopla on Cormac McCarthy. Actually bought several books by this author. Child Of God is somewhat of an interesting read. It jumps around a lot, little short chapters with ancedotes about the main character but I didn't see what relevence it had to the story(?). Basically, some society depraved, uneducated guy who lives in abandoned shacks and caves in the woods who kills people for the heck of it and then does unspeakable things to the females after they're dead. Not much of a story line, but the deeds this guys keeps doing, well, out of curiosity, you just keep reading to see. But in the end, very disappointing and you don't feel good after reading it. Suggest a pass on this one. By the way, I read 3 other of McCarthy's books and I will say this was one of the easier ones to read compared to the others."
3,una muy buena cancion,"this is good cd. there is one great song, the first one. Las canciones cambian de tono completamente, lo cual hace muy dificil relacionar las canciones con la musica. A mi hijo le encanta la adaptacion de que llueva, pero nada mas le interesa mucho."
1,Very Dissappointing,"This CD was not at all what I expected or what the cover portrayed. I thought this would be a collection of fun children's songs in Spanish, maybe some well-known preschool songs translated in Spanish. Instead, these songs sound like traditional old world hispanic music that is not appealing to my kids or myself at all."
1,Guessing Game,"How can you expect people to purchase movies, when you do not even indicate the titles?Is this too much to ask?Absolutley unbelievable to think that people are expected to buy a movie without knowing the title or the major actors."
3,good machine,"I purchased this machine a few years ago from costco (i dont remember how much i paid) after my moms old singer died after 20 something years. I have abused it quite a bit, but it still keeps going. I have used it on all types of fabric thick and thin and it has held up nicely. It had advertised on the box that it was capable of embroidery as well, im not familiar with embroidery but im looking into it now. I would recommend this machine to beginners (EASY to thread) and novice sewers."
4,Better than Seventh Generation,"These diapers are great. I didn't like that Seventh Generation diapers are beige, which makes them look dirty, they are also not 100% Chlorine free (read the small print on their package). I would say for younger babies Tendercare might not be soft or squishy enough but for older kids I like that they are not bulky and are easy for them to move around in. The only disadvantage to this diaper is not sticky tabs which lose their stickiness if you get any lotion or ointment on them."
2,not the most comfy diaper,"i'm glad they aren't bleached, but i'd rather have beige diapers that are stretchy & more comfortable for my little one's tush, like 7th Generation. these were too stiff and didn't fit as well. and i really don't like the sticky tabs - i prefer the stretchy velcro-like closures. not such a great bargain financially either."
4,Life Is A Movie...,"...that's not for rent. But you can buy this funky gem for next-to-nothin'. Canadian ambient funk, as I recall. Too bad none of the tunes can be audibly sampled here. Hard to describe in words what this CD does for your Chill Sessions - maybe 4:00AM - but it has a great slowed-down, street-wise, movie-theme kinda GROOVE you better not overlook this year...BUY THIS."
1,Extremely Disappointed,"I ordered this machine and the first one didn't have all of it's parts, the video was missing and the needle throat plate didn't sit in flush due to a casting defect. Amazon sent out another one which I just got today and it doesn't work at all. I've spoken with thier customer service and I am not impressed. I only get well you can return it and get a refund or we will send you another one. Then I am told to request to return online only the system won't let me because it still shows pending. Amazon & Singer obviously don't want my business."
1,missing parts,I haven't even been able to use this machine because it didn't come with all it's parts and it was in a sealed box!!! and I can't call anyone just send emails....I am not at all pleased.
4,small qualification,"I've been talking up and writing about this set for 40 years exactly the way most people here do. But I just revisited some of it the other day, after a very long break, and I must point out that in 132 the Marcia opening (immediately following the Song of Thanksgiving) has some really marked intonation problems, mostly (amazingly) Parisot's cello. I was very dismayed to hear it, as the Dankgesang is unsurpassed. I'm surprised they didn't do retakes, for the pitch sounds to me that jarringly off.PS - of course now on listening to other eminent versions I see that this is hardly uncommon. I mean, even the Berg and the Tokyo (whose work I love above all, or thought I did) sound a bit sour and overall imperfect in this little bracing quip of marcia writing. Hmm. Can an experienced string quartet player enlighten us all?"
4,Certainly worth having.,"Years ago, an old acquaintance of mine, a music professor from Columbia University in NYC, used to have a favorite term for recordings that may not have been absolutely top level (performance or sound,)but were enjoyable none-the-less. He used to say they were ""worth having."" This three cd set of the late Beethoven string quartets falls into that catagory. The sound is a bit dated (all of the recordings are around 40 years old,) but the performances are quite good, and certainly very enjoyable. And while they won't replace the Guarneri Qt., or the Italians, in these pieces for me, the recordings in this collection are worth every penny of the bargain price, and, indeed, they are certainly worth having!"
4,Exceeded Expectations,"There's always a bit of uncertainty in purchasing used products; this one exceeded my expectations. The description stated the condition as ""good."" The only drawback (if it can be considered) is the missing dust jacket. That being said, the condition was nearly new. The pages and binding are in great condition. The service was very prompt and accurate. I received the book just as promised."
5,More fun with Rachel,"As with all of the Signing Time productions, this set has visual, auditory and kinesthetic input for language learning. It adds early math and phonics to the fun. The fun and colorful presentation is attractive to the kids and adults alike and works wonders for those having problems with communication. Our 3 year old is an accomplished signer since he has watched the Signing Time CDs and now is countng to 20 verbally and signing and can add and subtract. He is beginning to sound words out."
4,A good tool,"I found this to be a fun and accuratemetaphorical story of how our Savior battled satan and death to win our salvation, and doesn't give up on us.In the vein of C.S. Lewis' The Narnia Chronicles. This would be a good story to read to kids and then show the parallels with scripture."
4,A Delightful Allegory,"I enjoyed reading ""Magwort and the Master."" It is a delightfl allegory following the Biblical World view. Specifically it deals with freedom and the bondage of the will. In a light setting it shows how a wild horse, one that is free, is in bondage to itself, its instincts, and its wolrdview. Then, when the Master claims the horse and subdues it, true freedom is found as the horse is freed from itself to serve another.A nice easy read."
5,Awesome product!!!!,I bought this for my best friend's birthday and she loves Tink! The sticker looks great!I put it on her car while she was working and she loved it!
1,Lasted 2 Weeks,The watch movement failed within a few weeks and Amazon stood behind their product (actually a 3rd party vendor) by giving a full refund. Granted it took about 2 months to get the refund but you live and learn. This watch is an icon and looks great on the wrist. It retains the classic Hesalite crystal and mechanical chronograph movement. The 1-star is due to the watch failing. I may pick one up again in the future.
1,Waste of money!,"In reading any fictional murder mystery, I like to come across the dead body by the end of the third chapter. This allows the author to introduce the characters and tell the beginning of the plot with lots of time left to investigate everyone involved and reveal the murderous culprit. If you like your novels like I do, avoid this Nancy Fairbanks book!! I most certainly didn't like reading more than 95% of this book to find out who got killed! And there is no investigation or mystery at all; the murderer is standing among several people, holding the pistol she just fired. If you want to read a mystery in which the dead body appears in the very first sentence, read ""Dark Tort"" by Diana Mott Davidson."
5,"""will you be my turkish delight?""",i bought this cd on a whim. my bf pointed it out to me. i tend to have a weakness for trampy looking girl singers. omg...let u me tell u... this has to be one of the trashiest cd's i own. it is (excuse my french) f****** fierce!!!the music is an infectious mix of turkish and dance beats. the vocals are rather limited but it doesn't matter. check her out! i can't even go on about how much i love this cd. it's trash-a-riffic fun! it never disappoints. it makes me want to dance all night long. and yes nez. i would be your turkish delight. this woman must release another album...NOW!
5,Great family movie night!,This was a very funny movie for a mature audience. We enjoyed it so much that we are making this our annual Christmas movie!
1,Ted,"very poor streaming, ordered HD version, but had to switch to normal DVD quality as streaming was constantly interrupted. don't usually have this problem when streaming movies with Netflix.."
1,Worst we have ever seen!!!!,"This movie was the worst we have ever seen. My wife and I felt that to use a teddy bear which generally represents love and cuddling, sends the wrong message to our children or whomever may end up seeing this crap. The cursing, the sex,the drugs, and story line...all garbage. There are some movies that may not be ""G"" rated that express opinions or views that are not so repulsive.We hope that Seth McFarlane will become more creative to consider his audiences and also hope those that find this entertaining will see this as nothing but what it is...junk. Seems that somehow we have become desensitized.At a time when our youth need guidance, lets give them a helping hand. Let them know you can have a good time without being profane or distasteful.Finally, we did not finish the movie and was angry that we were unable to get our money back (not the money, the principle).DN"
3,Original Movie - Some funny parts,I think this movie would have been so much better had they not hyped it up so much. Dragged at some points but there are definitely some great one liners in this film.Not for everyone. Definitely not for kids. You'll have to decide for yourself.
4,Good but definitely not for kids.,"My kids had to see this one. It was hilarious but dirty.Drugs, sex, F bombs everywhere.Hilarious show though."
2,Not as many LOL moments as I thought,"I had heard great reviews from many friends (although they were mostly from men who grunt) so I decided to give the movie a shot. While the movie had some funny moments, and it wasn't god awful, I didn't find the side-splitting moments that I heard others had experienced. As a child of the 80's, I did enjoy the pop culture references, and it was a bonus to discover that the guy who played Flash Gordon was still alive, but all in all the movie didn't live up to the hype. It didn't help that I couldn't get past the fact that the bear sounded like Peter Griffin. Glad I only spent $1.99 on the Amazon rental vs seeing it in the movies."
4,Funny,"Very funny in juvenile way,lik me, lol. Loved it. You will too. Watch it, if you love Famile Guy And American Dad."
2,Kind of funny?,"I was expecting much more from this movie. It did not have very good acting, and the bear was just stupid. I almost felt like I should laugh at parts just because I knew that was were the joke was.This movie is a good time waster so rentable, but not buyable."
1,POOR MOVIE,I DID NOT LIKE THE STORY LINE--WHEN KIDS SEE THE TEDDY BEAR DOING POT & LAUGHING & HAVING A GOOD TIME THEY WILL BELIEVE IT--ALSO THE SUPER HERO GOT EXTRA STRENGTH BY DOING POT--THAT WAS TERRIBLE--I'M NOT A PRUDE BUT THIS WHOLE MOVIE STANK!!!!!
4,Very funny Movie,Very funny adult movie. I hadn't had so many laughs in a comedy in a long time this is a great movie.
2,Could have been cute,"It had the potential to be qurky cute, sort of like Tom Hanks in ""Big"". But it was sooo vulgar & scatalogical that I didn't even finish watching it. Am a big fan of Seth McFarlane but he is so much wittier and brilliant than this movie. I give it 2 stars because I knew it would be over the top and smutty...otherwise I would have given it a 1."
3,Feels restrained,"I didn't know what to expect from Ted. I like Seth McFarlane and I watch his TV shows but this movie feels as if he was restrained. I suppose he may not wanted to have drawn too many comparisons with Family Guy or maybe he was trying to broaden his scope but either way, Ted feels half finished. Wahlberg acted his part well and the scenes with the bear are frequently funny but as a whole, I think either more time creating the story, or less time rewriting the story would have made for a much better movie."
3,comments regarding Ted,If you are looking for basic entertainment Ted is the movie. I found that after you were in to the movie the same repetitive humor lost its appeal.
3,Somewhat entertaining,After seeing the trailers I really wanted to go and enjoy this movie. The idea is cute but the script is rather weak. Very predictable situations. The acting is good and Ted is adorable while being rude and obnoxious.
3,Told it was a funny movie,"I liked the story overall, however, I did not think it was funny and I did not like the vulgar language. This movies could have been better for not the vulgar language."
3,Decent,Has some funny parts. All Family Guy characters actors are present which made me wonder why not a Family Guy live action?
2,wasn't impressed,the movie had a few funny parts but that is about it. this movie looked way funnier in the previews. disappointed.
3,Funny,"Not hilarious funny, but fun to watch. I wouldn't be tempted to watch again though. Good cast, looks like they had fun making it."
4,Ted,"Witty and worth the time. Put the kids to bed and enjoy some mindless entertainment. Your sides will hurt, not your head."
4,Never met a Ted like this!,Hilarious! Not for the faint of heart - when it says unrated it's because it should be - nothing like a trash talking Teddy Bear!
3,Ehhh...,"It was generally mildly entertaining with a couple laugh out loud moments. It's better than most of what's coming out as a ""comedy"" lately, but far from a comedic masterpiece.I wouldn't watch it again and might...might recommend to a friend."
5,Was a great gift for my husband who is hard to shop for,Was a great gift for my husband who is hard to shop for plus we got the talking ted and a mini Ted
5,great movie,great movie i wish i had seen it in theaters would mind seeing more Seth Movies maybe a Seth Rogen and Seth McFarlane??
4,So hilarious!!,"I didn't know how I would feel about this movie, but I thought it was hilarious. However, it does wear thin towards the end...*spoiler* they could have left the whole fenway park scenes out. Although, I get they had to show at least one scene there...as they usually do during movies filmed in Boston."
5,super funny a must for any dvd collection,"a great comedy very crude and what you'd expect you got to have a sense of humor for this movie ted was well done Seth MacFarlane did an awesome job with this flick the voice of peter griffin only added a great familiar touch of family guy , the bond of some thing from your childhood can be priceless to add some humor in the mix makes it even better , so give this movie a chance i just think the negative reviews on this movie are bogas them people just could not relate any of there life to this movie"
3,"Okay, has decent underlying current..","Okay comedy. MacFarlane has set the bar pretty high for himself with the coming together of Family Guy. I like the underlying current of this film, but other parts of it are a bit lacking. It is still a decent movie, just not as good as the director is capable of making. I sense that maybe he has had a bit too much success, maybe the ""Stewie"" part of his personality is finding its dominance in more ways than one!~"
3,eh,"it was like a family guy episode. a few zingers, but mostly it fell flat for me. perhaps you need to be stoned."
2,Meh,"Funny at times because it's Seth MacFarlane's writing, however, some of the scenes were just plain awkward to see acted out..."
4,"Hilarious, irreverent and fun!","This is just a wonderful romp. Sure, there's a moral to the story and all that, but it's just intended to be a fun ride for all. Enjoy!"
4,VERY FUNNY!,Do not have your kids watch it. I don't even think I would let my 16 year old see it. Definitely funny and for adults only.
2,this is a marginal movie with little to offer in comedy,this is a marginal movie with little to offer in comedy 9 more words required 5 more words required 1
1,"If swearing is funny, then you'll love it.","No substance. If a swearing teddy bear is funny, then you'll like it. It got old... fast. Admittedly, I turned it off after an hour. So, maybe it got really good at the end."
3,Not what many rave about,"Unique story, Plenty of good laughs. Listening to the voice of ""Peter from Family Guy"" as Ted made it difficult to see Ted as his own character. I think they should have used a different actor for that part. Well done movie but over all my feeling was... eh.I expected laughter from beginning to end based on people's recommendations but the voice issue was really the con for me."
3,college/profane humor,Over the top in regards to profanity; so much so that I think it detracts from the humor. Could have been funnier.
3,Not that funny,Not nearly as funny as billed in the trailer. A little clunky and awkward at times. Average comedy at best.
3,few funny parts,I thought this would have been funnier than it was........glad I did not buy offer go to the theater to watch.
3,It was ok...,...just glad I didn't pay full price to purchase or see in the movie theater. It is worth a rental but not anything else in my opinion.
4,Ted ROCKS!!,"Awesome movie!! Love Seth McFarlane!!! Gotta love the Family Guy type humor but if you do, this movie is great!!"
4,A must see,"Very funny, look for additional little laughs on boxes and in the background . A must see! Not for children!!"
2,Funny not HD,Funny movie but paid for HD version and had to watch in standard. Should not have been charged for HD.
3,Just alright.,Thsi movie made me laugh a few times. Not worth renting or buying. Wish I could reverse this sale. Not as funny as I thought it would be.
4,Ted (Unrated),This movie was SO funny. We laughed so hard we cried. If you're looking for a fun movie to watch this is a great choice.
3,funny and boring,"It has some very funny parts, very original. But the story is quite boring, too simple, even for an evening with friends."
2,Not That Great,"Was excited after seeing the commercials about this on TV, but never got to the theatre. Had it recommended by several people later, but was rather disappointed when watching it. I guess if you're a big fan of the The Family Guy, you'll probably like it, but generally speaking, it's not that funny."
4,Funny,Funny movie no doubt. Wasn't sure the wife would like it since she's not a fan of Seth McFarland and can't stand family guy ( which I love) she was cracking up the whole time too.
3,Ehh,I didn't expect this to turn into a date movie. That's my major gripe. I wanted more humor and less lovey-dovey.
3,a bit to ranchy.,Love Mark Wahlberg and Ted but I wrongly viewed the uncut version. Movie was up and down with humor. Some parts very funny but funny trailers doesn't make a movie.
4,Super Funny,If you are a fan of family guy them you'll love this movie. Ted is the funniest bear ever. Overall It's a good movie.
4,Funny,Thought this was funny for the first half of it then it went downhill and became kind of boring toward the end.
3,Enjoyable,"It was ok, but not as funny as I thought it would be. Maybe worth another 1/2 star for cast and acting."
5,Too Funny,"This was so funny. My husband and I had a family Christmas Party (adults) we watched it that evening, some guests spent the night and we watched it again the next morning over bagels and coffee and laughed even more"
3,Comment,If the movie was HD I think that you guys should make it surround sound plus subtitles...other companies does....
3,For grown kids,Ho_hum plot with an expected ending. But cute in a raunchy sort of way. I am a fan of Wahlberg so I enjoyed it anyway.
3,It Was Just Ok,"There were plenty of funny moments throughout the movie to keep viewers interested but, I think itcould have done just as well without all of the drug use/references."
2,Decent but humor gets old.,"Overall, I enjoyed Ted but the humor got to be old. Obviously, a movie about a talking Teddy Bear is a stretch in itself, but there was also a pretty lame attempt at a story line. I could have taken 30 minutes of the humor without a story line, but it got to be too much and too predictable."
1,not for me,I love family guy but sorry this movie just wasn't funny to me. Guess I'm just not into pot humor
1,NOT FOR CHILDREN!!!!!!,"This is not a cute Teddy. He is gross, disgusting and very vulgar. Do not allow your small children to watch this movie."
1,Worst movie I have seen in some time...,My wife and I are both fans of Family Guy so we thought we would give Ted a try. Big mistake. We were barely able to get through it (I actually fell asleep in the middle). Not recommended.
1,sucked,"We watched the whole thing, but we couldn't wait for it to end. It was a little ridiculous. The narration wasn't funny. The storyline was ADD."
5,Amazingly funny!!!!,Absolutely historical. I f you can not see the humor and wit in this movie then you should truly check to see if you still have a pulse. I cried from laughter! It was funny from start to finish!!!!!
2,Over Rated,I heard such rave reviews but I guess I don't get it. I was bored with the movie. It was a waste of my night.
2,Crude filth,This could have been a very funny movie but relied on crude sexual innuendos to make a story line. I was looking for something light and funny instead I was bought down.
2,Not impressed,We had high expectations but this movie fell flat. Same dumb jokes over and over. A few funny parts here and there but overall nothing great.
2,ted,"Funny, but not as funny as previews would indicate. Slow at times. Would purchase again. Mildly entertaining. Could have had more"
2,Not good,"Before watching this, I was debating whether MacFarlane was a genius. After watching this, I'm no longer debating the point. He's not a genius. Something about the nature of real action, as opposed to cartoons, exposed just how juvenile his humor is. Not funny."
2,"First time was wonderful, Second time was horrible","The very first time I saw this movie I was in the movie theater with my brother. We were in love with the movie and thought everything about it was hilarious. Later when I rented this movie to watch it again, alone, I realized just how stupid and plot-less this movie was. There were still some parts that gave a chuckle but I found myself getting up multiple times to do other things and not really paying attention to the movie. If you are a guy who likes to smoke pot and live your personal fantasies then this movie will be your favorite. But if you are someone who likes more realistic humor then this movie will be a vast disappointment. I believe this movie is only good the first time around ( I wouldn't recommend buying it) or it could have just been funny because of the company I was with."
2,Didn't Live up to the Hype,"For months, I've heard how great 'Ted' was, and that it was a ""must watch."" I finally caved and rented this, and indeed I had a few moments where I chuckled. However, it was far from the laugh out loud comedy I was expecting. I'm left with the distinct impression that this movie would be better under the influence of recreational pharmaceuticals."
2,Raunchy,This movie should have never even tried to be a comedy. It didn't even come close to a dark comedy I really can't believe that I watched it. Not worth the money to rent even if it was .99c
2,Wasn't expecting much,"and that is what I got. I don't like watching any of Seth Mcfarlane's tv shows, but my bf loves them,so based on that and the few previews I did see made the movie look pretty funny, so what the hey, right? Well, just repeating a lot of what I saw in the other reviews, all the funny parts are in the previews. It was an ok movie, but I think it could've been a lot funnier. The scenes (and I don't wanna spoil it) where they meet the hero of their childhood was pretty good, but other than that, just kinda blah... Btw, the bf who, again, is a huge Seth Mcfarlane fan,also didn't think too highly of it either, if that is worth it to any other SM fan, who is trying to decide whether to buy/rent this movie."
3,Remove the f word,To much f word and yes i use the f word myself 31 years in the construction business and a teddy bear cussed worst i heard. Hollywood get a grip . Or just start making pornos with teddy bears
2,I really wanted to like this,"I'm a huge fan of Seth McFarlane and the Family Guy show. HUGE fan. Also kind of a Wahlberg fan, ever since being blown away by his performance in Boogie Nights. Finally, I'm from the Boston area, so I always love to watch films set in our town. Unfortunately, Ted was a sort of triple let down.First and foremost, the movie is just not very funny. Certainly there are some good laughs in here, but the plot is thin, the jokes are too obvious and lazy, and the production value is lacking. It seemed more like an overly-long episode of a sitcom than a movie.I usually try to pay close attention to any film, even comedies, to catch some of the nuance of dialog, set design, etc., but I found myself paying more attention to my laptop while watching this. In fact, my wife and I both fell asleep during this movie. Though to be fair we have a three-year-old and a newborn, so perhaps there were other forces working against us at 10:00pm on Saturday!"
1,aweful,"This was one of the worst movies I have ever watched. Actually stopped watching it 1/2 way through. So stupid and disgusting. Extremely juvenile and obnoxious, especially towards women."
1,The worst movie I have ever seen,This is in the top five of worst movies I have ever see in 52 years of movie watching. Only two Will Ferrell movies were worse than this. This is 1 1/2 hours of my life I can never get back. Seth McFarlane- not funny IMO.
1,Horrible!,This is the most disgusting and vulgar movie I've seen yet....I was truly disappointed ...never thought I would see Mark Wahlberg in such a low class movie as this....so sad....
3,Not that great,"If this movie had 2 normal people in it and not a teddy bear it would of never been made. Not a fan of family guy so my review might not count but wanted to like it my kind of humor. Just because it is a teddy bear doing these things (bong hits, curse words ect.) makes it funny not in my book."
2,Didn't like it,most of the jokes were drugs related and they were not funny at all. A horrible script for such a great and handsome actor as Mark W.
2,Bland,"I thought it relied too much on the emphasis of extremely crude humor to be funny. Sorry story line, really bland, dragged on, thought it would be funnier than it was. Followed the structure of Family Guy too close. Could have been better."
1,Movie WAS GREAT!!! Amazon QUALITY HORRIBLE!!!,"The problem was Amazon streaming. it was worse than a pirate movie quality. The movie was extremely funny, Amazon gets 2 thumbs down!"
4,Hilarious!!,"I thought it was insanely funny but the movie is geared more towards guys. Needless to say, my girlfriend did not really like it..."
1,Disgusting--certainly not family entertainment!,"Wahlberg needs his brain examined... having accomplished other well-acted roles, to demean himself with the vulgarity of MacFarlane's warped sense of humor has diminished his capabilities in the eyes of our family and the majority of our associates. There is no one iota of social redeeming value in this trashcan flick... avoid like the plague unless you, too, reside in the gutter."
1,Watch only if you are a Seth MacFarlane Fan...,"If you are not a Seth MacFarlane Fan, do not watch this. I have watched episodes of the second iteration of Family Guy, American Dad, and Cleveland Show. I find his shows idiotic and formulaic. They are basically shows about randomized crass humor with no story line cohesiveness whatsoever. This movies is basically the same. I don't want to go on how it is basically stupid humor. That is obvious. But I want to point out one issue. Although I am a ""conservative"", I am for gay rights. Seth is a major proponent of gay rights but his humor tends to border on gay bashing. It really infuriates me. If you want to watch something crass but with smart and thoughtful humor, just watch an episode of South Park. They are very hit and miss, but a poor episode of theirs has more humor than anything MacFarlane can come up with.[Update 12/27/2012] Changed review title, didn't make sense"
1,Horrible,Ted was a waste of $3.99 and a 1 hr 45 min. of my life. Don't waste your money or time on this movie.
1,Terrible movie,If you like good movie do not watch this one. You will never get these 2 hours of your life back.
1,Stupid Movie,Stupid movie for stupid people. Its exactly what you would expect no plot surprises no thought provoking scenes. Hollywood just doesn't seem to care anymore.
1,Crude and Gross,Bought this movie because friends said it was the funniest movie they had ever seen. Guess we have different taste in movies. I didn't even make it a third way through it before I shut it off. I found it so very crude and gross that it over rode anything funny that could possibly have been in it. Seller was great...movie was not!
3,Meh,I chuckled at parts but it was predictable and most of the funny parts were in the previews. Worth $1-$2 to rent :)
1,a waste of time,"I would have rather watched a few episodes of family guy in the time it took to watch this. There were a few funny parts, but it was overall pretty disappointing."
2,Boring movie - do not purchase,Please do not purchase this movie. It is not worth the time or money. It is boring and I actually turned it off before the end. This movie is not funny at all and I had maybe 2 laughs.
1,How stupid,"Anyone giving this a good review is smoking dope. We didn't even finish the movie. Awful, Awful, Awful, Awful, Awful"
1,Infantile,Waste of time unless you want to flash back to your 20's and watch it stoned out of your gourd.
3,okay,it was ok. It defiently had its laugh out loud moments. A few times my husband and I were in tears but towrds the end it took a more serious note and I felt took away from the comedy of the movie. I did enjoy it though and would absoutly watch the beginning again.
5,Seth Macfarlane is a comedy god,"Always pushing comic social commentary just over the line (or well past it), Ted does not disappoint. If you are secretly harbor a wicked raunchy streak, this is an awesome flick."
1,Surprised,"After seeing the theater movie trailers it seemed like a movie to watch when it comes out on DVD. Surprise! The trailers did not indicate the F-rated language and context of the movie. Why anyone would take a childhood cuddly bear and turn it into a foul mouthed, dope smoking, sex fiend is an indication how low writers can go. Avoid this movie if you were looking to be entertained."
1,Family Guy repackaged and not very good,Ted has Peter Griffens voice!!! WTH? How can Seth use his most recognizable characters voice as Ted and then use all the actors from Family Guy in the same movie and think it's creative? Very disappointed.
1,Expected so much more...,"We were really looking forward to this, but it felt like I was watching Alf again. It had a very predictible storyline, and seemed to go downhill as it went on."
2,Not worth $14,"The movie is ok, not comedy gold. Honestly it's just not that funny or clever. It's a bit of a Wilfred ripoff, but with less complexity in the characters and storyline. If you're looking for something with even a little depth in the comedy, this is not your flick. If all you want is simple, surface-level jokes and puns, this movie would likely be a perfect substitute for Scoobie Doo while smoking a bowl."
1,Profanity,Too much profanity and ugly statements...Too much unnecessary action..Story line was good but took away from story with too much vilience...
1,Awful......,Ridiculous. So bad I didn't even finish it and I usually like Mark Wahlberg.Don' waste your time and money!
1,Not Funny.,"Stupid funny can be funny sometimes like I thought this might be. However it was just stupid-stupid. I watched it bc someone told me they weren't a Family Guy fan and found it funny. I'm not either but unfortunately it was more of the Family Guy type of ""humor"". If you like the show you might like this movie."
1,Major Disappointment!,Very thin plot. Mostly worn out jokes about body parts and gas. They missed a great opportunity to make a funny movie. Mark Wahlberg was solid as usual but the writing was weak and Ted came off as being creepy instead of cute. Hopefully we won't see a Ted2.
1,Wow! This was awful,"Mark Walberg has kids? I get it is rated R, but crude is an understatement. A movie that could have been funny but was vulgar just to be vulgar makes the viewing experience not worth your time."
1,NOT FUNNY,"Someone told me that if you don't find Macfarlane's ""Family Guy"" style of humor funny, then this movie wasn't for you. They were absolutely correct. Watching this movie was torture and had I not paid to rent it there is no way I would not have finished it. PS: If you are going to have jokes about child abuse, they had better be funny, otherwise it's just sad."
3,Funny but was expecting more,Glad I didn't pay movie theatre prices - but it was a fun watch during a snowstorm. I thought I would laugh more.
2,Disappointed,I adore Mark Wahlberg and see all his movies. I really wanted to like this because I think Seth McFarland is brilliant. Aside from a couple great lines and funny moments i thought it was boring and couldn't wait for it to end... Sorry Wahlberg fans
3,So so movie,A bit juvenile and raunchy but that is what I expected from the Seth (Ted). Middle of the road on this one.
3,It's okay,I did not laugh near as much as I thought I would. While there were some hilarious parts overall it was lacking.
4,Hilarious!,"Non-stop, raunchy laughter! Had to watch it more than once. Definitely recommend it. Instant video was a plus when deciding upon purchasing options."
2,Family Guy-style,"Ted had heavy marketing as a foul Seth MacFarland movie, but it fell short in my opinion. Yes, Ted has some bad habits, but the comedy falls flat. Ted really isn't that interesting, the pacing is somewhat boring, as well as the characters. Family Guy for the silver screen didn't translate."
3,Entertaining Enough,I was hoping that it would be hilarious being that Seth McFarland was involved and being a big fan of his other projects like Family Guy. It had a few good laughs and it's a great premise but it ends up being just okay. I think Seth McFarland's strength lies in the cutaway scenes to absurd situations to exaggerate a point like in Family Guy. Definitely glad I waited to see it via stream instead of going to the theatre.
3,About what I expected,There are definitely some funny parts in the movie but it's not great or anything. I would say that it is worth watching though. The Boston accents are enough for a few good laughs.
3,Not the funniest movie of all time as advertised,"it was alright, had a few really funny parts but wasn't as advertised ""as the funniest movie of all time"""
2,not good,"I would have thought was this written by Seth Macfarlane when he was 15. Awful. Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis, tsk, tsk, thought ya'll were better than this."
5,Item great. Packaging horrible!!!,"glad to receive the item. Box a little smashed though. Packaging was absolutely horrible! Box was not sealed... was crushed... you could see inside my package because someone was able to press the side which was just a folded together untaped box. It 's amazing my products didn't fall out. Terrible packaging!,, But product gets high rating."
3,meh,"Pretty disappointed in the movie and it wasn't because all the funny parts were in the trailer(which they were). I think it could have been better than it was, but it fell flat."
4,Funny but....,Probably don't want to watch this with your mother in law. Some awkward scene's and lines (It is a Seth Macfarlane movie after all!) I will never look at hand lotion the same!
2,Must be a guy movie,"The movie was not funny and rather stupid, not sure why Barbara Walters said it was one of the funniest movies this year ."
4,Fun Movie,Alot better than I thought it would be! We laughed and enjoyed this movie very much ! Give it a try!
4,Pretty funny,"Was ok but most of the funniest parts were in the previews, story line could be improved over all not bad for $1.99 would not watch again"
4,Great Movie,"Funny and a bit over the top. I would watch it again. But it's a bit like watching Family guy,"
3,It was ok,It was funny but some scenes where kinda bizarre. Story and acting where little below the mark but was a fun movie over all .
2,Just didn't like,I couldn't watch the movie after the poop sceen. Just too stupid. I know people are saying this is comic genius but I tried watching 3 times and hated it more each time. There are far better movies by ANY of the poeple involved in this move. Sorry Ted lovers- this movie was too dumb for me.
2,Not a fan,"I was not a fan of this movie. It was funny a few times but mostly just dumb. I personally would not recommend it to anyone, Maybe someone in early 20's would appreciate it more"
2,Ugh!,"What a slog it was to get through this. It was just a live action version of The Family Guy, and I like that show. Not very funny. Expected more from Seth."
1,Horrible,"I knew from the previews that this was going to be the stupidest movie I've ever wasted my time watching. I watched it to humor my husband and because we were told it was very funny. I gave it the benefit of the doubt, even though I positively despise ANY movie that stars Mark Wahlberg. Needless to say, unless your 12 or smoke a lot of pot, or just have somewhat off kilter humor, you probably won't really find it that amusing..."
2,Stupid...,"I am sorry, I normally like stuff from Seth, this one is crap. It was a slow going movie, boring and the jokes are lame."
1,Horrible,"This was a really stupid movie and my wife and I hated it. We saw the unrated version. Skip it, please."
2,Marky Mark?,Mark Whalburg can do better than this. The dialogue was awful and the jokes were poor stand-up material. Maybe two good belly laughs. The rest was crap.
1,Ted,"Ted is about a teddy bear coming to life and when he is older he drinks, does drugs and swears. I watched half of this and stopped it. If I could return it for something good I would."
4,Ted,Funny as hell and worth the rental fee . The bear and wahlberg are very funny as a team. Highly recommend
3,Laughter is healthy,This is funny but really and I say Really got tired of the foul language. You would think that writers would have a better vocabulary to use than the same ole F word.
2,Meh,"Was excited to see this, but it turns out all of the family guy characters are just shoved into ""Ted""'s teddy bear brain. Kinda lame for the most part. Very disappointing."
3,Like a Creepy Live Episode of Family Guy,"Since we see many of the voice actors from Seth MacFarlane's crew in person here, and since the humor is pretty much the same as Family Guy, this was just kind of like watching a decent, very long, episode of Family Guy or American Dad. For example, they make fun of the fact that the voice of Peter is the voice of the bear at least a billion times, which is old after the first time they do it. The novelty of the talking, cursing bear, is over in about 20 minutes as well. Still, there were a few funny moments, and if you like Family Guy, or that style of humor, then renting this in non-HD format is worth it. There are no special effects, or sound considerations here, that really benefit from an HD rental or purchase. I would strongly encourage you to rent, and not purchase, this movie. Still, paying to see it was a bit much for me. Oh well, I did it, and can't un-do it."
2,Really crude.,"Definitely NOT a family movie. Could have been a better movie without all the ""F"" bombs. It said in the ratings that it had crude humor, just wasn't expecting it to be that crude."
2,More crude than funny.,"I don't mind the crudeness as long as it is funny. There were a few laugh out loud moments, but that is it."
1,Such good reviews...but such a waste of time!,"I've heard nothing but how funny this movie is for months, so I finally rented it thru Amazon. What a waste of time and money. Awful cannot even describe how bad this movie is...and I watched the whole thing hoping it would get better somewhere along the line. It did not."
1,Poor Quality,"The movie skipped through the entire movie and blanked out - it was a mess! Not sure why, but disappointed considering I paid almost $20 for it"
2,not great,"you'd think this would be a good movie bc of the people in it, but it was pretty terrible and not really funny."
1,So stupid,"My wife insisted we watch this piece of ***** . I hated it. Even she thought is was terrible. REALLY, does Mark Whalberg really need the money so bad that he takes a role like this? I have seen Whalberg in some outstanding films and hoped there might be some substance to this movie......NOT SO!"
1,Worst movie I've seen in 20 years,"Complete trash, don't waste time, money or band width. Crap, crap. How they ever got reasonably good actors to play in this is crazy"
1,HD?,"The movie was hysterical, when it was on. I was watching on a 3mb stream and it took about 3 hours to watch this hour and a half long movie. Four or five times it stopped to load, then stopped saying the network was unavailable. The picture quality that I paid more to get looked like an amateur YouTube video. I will not be moving forward with this service."
1,Horrible,Only a few funny parts. I wouldn't waste my time to watching it again. Even for free. Save your money.
3,Ted (Unrated),I was disappointed in this moview. I thought it contrived and pretty juvenile. I wouldn't recommend it. Don't waste your time!
2,South Park Ted meets dud,"Story line starts out sappy, gets worse, uses lots of ""f*****g"" language which was supposed to be funny??? This really fell flat as a ""new idea"" movie. Ted has more of a life than the humans."
2,Wasn't as funny,Maybe I'm missing something but I thought this movie was way overhyped. It had a few funny moments but nothing you missed from the previews.
3,A three at best !!!,I did not see this as any grand comedy . I watched the first half & laughed out loud twice . Maybe I don't get stoned enough . I almost stopped watching & realized I had paid 1.99 to see the whole thing . The Flash Gordon bits were humorous . But I spent more time thinking that something funny would happen than actually being amused . If you can borrow or rent it for a 1.09 it might be worth it . This is not a movie for children .
2,Crude and almost boring,"A ""B"" movie if I ever saw one! Plentiful foul language makes this unsuitable for children. Only redeeming quality is Ted cuteness factor."
2,Terrible acting & an even worse story line...,"Don't waste your time or money. This movie is terrible. Bad acting, unbelievably un-humorous & a horribly written story line. I could only take about 20 minutes of this movie before wanting to poke my eyes out with a fully heated curling iron."
2,I had hoped for much more.,The premise sounded and look great on the previews but that was all there was with just more of the same. Disappointing.
1,Yikes.,I will not get that time I spent watching this back. It was just a train wreck...you couldn't turn away.
1,How could such a wonderful premis be so bad?,The idea is wonderful. The execution goes to far past vulgar to even be tollerable. Too bad they didn't think this through before they started.
1,Don't throw your money away,"Mark Wahlberg is funny, but the casting and script are terrible. Mark should stick to his tough guy role. We stopped this train deck at 15 minutes, because we couldn't tolerate it. I'm 57 and my GF is 52, but if you're in another age category, there is a very slight chance tha you'd find this thing (movie) to be funny. Watch the Candidate."
1,Awful,I'm not really sure what the point of the movie was. I kept waiting for the movie to get better and then it ended. Absolutely awful.
4,Very Funny,Ted was not a great movie but I laughed my but off. Because it is so funny I recommend it.
4,Crude but very funny!,We love Family Guy so this was right down our alley. Even my conservative uptight cousin laughed and stayed awake!Seth McFarlane is so clever!
5,Ted,"""TED"" is an excellent movie. It's a little slow to start however, it turns out to be an extremally funny movie. I love it. I have watched it several times and of course i recommed it to all my friends and family. I have purchased several copy's for friends and family."
1,Stupid!,Anyone who could possibly think this was remotely funny is very immature! It was horrible an a waste of money and time to watch!
1,Ted,"I really wanted to go and see this movie cause it looked funny, I mean come on a talking bear! But really Seth this movie didn't even make me giggle it only made me smile. This movie had very poor humor and went a little to far like are you serious a bear and a girl having sex like come on.PlotThe plot was that Ted and main character were childhood friends and then they get older and he is in love with his girlfriend and it was the whole me or the bear thing. Yawn. Then the bear is kiddnapped by a man and a boy who wanted to buy Ted so that his son could have a friend. Yawn.If you really wanna see it I would highly suggest you rent it ! I sat there wanting to go to sleep cause I have seen this plot like a thousand times it was a really bad movie that I felt embarrassed about wanting to go see it."
2,basic stoner comedy,"not really to my taste, the teddy bear could have been replace by any slacker and it would have been almost the same movie. the hook is a teddy bear that drinks, smokes pot, does coke, and has sex with hot women. with a minor in coming of age."
3,It's a real bear of a movie.,Entertaining but over the top with crude humor. The ending was the best part of the movie and the actors were good. You should know what to expect from this movie if you watch Family Guy.
1,Awful,I was told this was funny. I was so disappointed. There were few funny moments but it was just not worth the rental fee.
2,Not for me,"Poor story line. Humor even less sophisticated than the ""Family Guy"". Basically, if you don't like the Family Guy you probably won't like Ted."
2,Didn't live up to the hype,"Based on what I had heard about this movie, I expected to be rolling on the ground laughing. This never happened, not to say I did not laugh though. Lots of vulgar humor, which is popular today, and many times I enjoy it just as much as others. However, this fell rather short of my expectations."
2,Basically Family Guy,If you like Family Guy you'll like Ted. I don't so I didn't think it was very good. Ted is basically Peter Griffin.
2,Not worth the money,I was not impressed with the movie at all. It was weird to say the least. I would not waste your money.
2,Redundent and boring,Crude humor wears thin half way through and then very boring after the novelty wears off. My daughter insisted on renting this and then I find she went to bed and I was the last one standing suffering through this.
2,Ted,"For all of the promotional hype, I felt that this movie did not stand up to all of the critical acclaims."
1,Hard to sit thru this,Long Slow movie. Not recommended. All you can hear is Peter Griffin through the whole movie (Seth McFarland). Silly and not worthwhile. Save your money.
2,Sophomoric and vulgar,"The premise of this movie was potentially very funny and entertaining. Instead it quickly degraded into unnecessarily foul language and toilet humor, with very few laughs."
2,Wait til its free to watch,There were definitely funny parts but was it really necessary to drop the F bomb every other word. It also went longer than necessary.
2,not that funny,The movie wasn't much once you got past the first few laughs. You quickly realize the entire primus of the movie revolves around smoking pot. Wow.
2,"A few funny moments, and pure raunch.","You know, I love comedy and old slapstick, even Billy Madisonesque movies. This went way to far. The raunch took away from some very well written comedy, brief comedy."
3,"Maybe it's just that we're both over 60, but","One of our geezer friends said he LOVED it so we rented. I love Family Guy so a ""Seth MacFarlane"" seemed a good choice. But to me the humor lacked the cleverness in F-G and I had trouble getting into it. The compelling minutes to me were the beginning and ending - where life comes into the bear and .... not to spoil. Here I believed it. But otherwise, it was hokey. My wife, in a big surprise to me, liked it far better and she only tolerates F-G and Robot Chicken. Go figure!"
1,Didn't even get to watch it!,"Okay let start by saying how frustrated I am right now. I rented this movie with the understanding that I could wait to watch it until the 31st. As it said I could. BUT, when I did go to watch it, It wouldn't load. So I decided that I would wait a while before trying again. So I went to watch it tonight and to my disappointment.. THERE WAS NOTHING THERE TO WATCH? Did I miss something. I would love a way contact somebody and get my money back or maybe the movie put back on my list so I can actually watch it! I'm very displeased with this. Guess i'll be using movie rental machines outside stores for now on. -_-"
1,"Rude, crude and unfunny.","I am truely sorry to have watched this. I wanted to bail after about 30 mins but my wife tlhought we should give it a chance to redeem itself. Not by a long shot. In the words of Clint Eastwood, ""what a waste of film""."
2,this movie sucked,This movie stunk! I know there is a cute bear on the cover but this is not a kids movie. There is not a rating on it so that is a little deceptive. This movie is full of childish humor that is not appropriate for children.
2,Bad Movie,I did not enjoy this movie at all. I thought the plot was pretty bad and the jokes were mediocre.
1,"dumb movie, save your money.","Save your money or if you absolutly have to see it, rent it somewhere else cheaper than on here. Somewhere where they will charge $0.01 so you wont feel like you just spent 1.5hrs for nothing."
5,HILARIOUS!,"I loved this movie, although it is similar to family guy or southpark humor, so if you like those kind of shows, you will laugh your ass off!"
1,Unbelievably bad.,"If you were to take a black marker and draw fake eyebrows on your toes, they would be more high brow than this movie.Perhaps this is funny if you are prepubescent (or close to that age), but as an adult, I have no idea how anyone could suffer through this movie in its entirety."
3,Pretty lame,Save your money. Cld of been a lot more funny. Pretty gross at times wld not recommend. At times very stupid.
3,Ted,"I chose this rating because the movie was funny. I did not like all of the fowl language. It was very hard to enjoy the movie with the ""F"" bomb being dropped with every other word!"
2,It was over-rated,"I like Family Guy. I like Teddy Bears, even loud-mouthed ones. I don't like Flash Gordon; never did. This was good for a movie about a drug-addled teddy bear, but it was certainly over-byped over the last year. You should watch this when it's $2.99. $4.99 was too much & so was $3.99. But it was a good movie; it's just not worth more than $2.99."
2,funny lines thats it,"The previews of movie were the best parts. Over all a waste of time, rather have slept. Don't recommend movie"
2,Stuffed animal doing drugs?,Rented the movie via Prime and wish I had the money back. While humorous in parts the movie as a whole isn't suffering through to get to the funny.
2,"Flat, not funny","I like both leads, the bear animation is well done, but Ted just isn't funny, I can remember two laughs in the whole film."
3,Not as good as expected,This movie had its moments but overall wasn't as funny as I had hoped. As usual it seems the trailers show the best parts
2,The joke gets old quickly,"It's funny for the first 45 minutes, then recycles the same old gags and gets tiresome. So what if you can recognize the Griffin family in the voices.Not recommended."
2,Ted was a bomb,I was hoping for a super funny movie with this great cast but was let down. I thought the jokes were bad plot was horrible and I kept thinking of family guy with that voice.Wow how creative a movie about a guy who doesn't want to grow up and get married and is loser friend keeps pulling him back to him. Girl Hates friend and threatens to leave him. Blah blah blah. It's him or me story.It gets better towards the end but the beginning is horrible. Especially the part with the hookers.
1,WASTE OF TIME $$$$,waste of time and money fuuny is one thing and that is not this movie at all only watched 15 min and removed itworst one I have seen all year
1,Huh??,"This movie was weird. Parts were funny, parts were just disgusting and dirty. Some parts were heartwarming. I did not really like it."
1,One of the worst movies ever made.,I made it through about a half hour of the movie. It was juvinile...I felt like I was in junior high again. Skip it.
1,more pablum,way stupid for anyone with any sense of humor very basic tripe tired plot and inane writing do not waste your time unless you are under 14 and need to learn gutter
1,Worst movie of all time,"Literally unwatchable. No comedic value, horribly written, we did not laugh a single time in the first 30 minutes before turning it off. Please do not waste your time."
1,HORRIBLE,Would never recommend this movie to anyone. A bong smoking bear who is a grown man's best friend is simply not funny.
3,Funny in spots with good acting.,It's worth the watch if your a fan of the actors. Don't expect to be rolling on the floor but there are some good slap stick antics and story lines. They do a good job of bringing Ted to life so it seems he is real as you get into watching him. Plot is not too bad as Ted has to move out so his owner can get married. It's worth a look and you'll get a few good laughs. Not for kids but a bottle of wine or your favorite recreational drug will go good with this flick.
3,A Movie About What Would Happen If Your Favorite Toy Grew Up,"A decent entry into film by FAMILY GUY's creator, Seth McFarlane. The notion of a raunchy grown up teddy and his pal goofing around the Boston is fun for the first hour, but gets old quickly without the usual jokes that McFarlane uses to keep the Griffins fun in their TV spot."
4,very good,had way more adult content than expected but really funny. I woud ldefinitley recomend it and rent and watch it if you get a chance
5,I will never look a teddy bear the same,It was side hurting funny. I watched it alone but I think my neighbors could hear me laughing. I could not stop even when the tears started the laughing continued.
3,"Funny parts, but some really immature humor that is overly distasteful...","First of all, this movie surprised me - in a good way. It has some ""heart"" behind it, which I really appreciated. I am a fan of the American Pie series so I am definitely not an update movie viewer, but I have to say - some of the jokes in this movie pushed the line a little too far. Without giving away too much, the part involving poop was really distasteful and totally unnecessary. Other than that, there are some pretty funny parts. Ted is kind of a jerk but loveable all the same. I wouldn't go out of your way to watch it, but if it happens to be on or you're bored - go for it."
5,ted,"it was great to watch again, I remember watching it a year ago and it's still as great as ever. I would recommend it to anyone to buy."
2,EH,"Wasn't thrilled. LOVE LOVE LOVE Seth McFarlane but this was definitely ""boy"" humor. I liked it, I laughed, I enjoyed it just not one of my TOP comedies"
2,Expecting Family Guy funny? It's not.,"OK, I'm a pretty big Seth McFarlane fan. I love Family Guy and his Cavalcade of Comedy. This movie however, missed the mark. I had high expectations of it and it totally let me down. It had its funny moments and I laughed here and there, but the plot was BEYOND boring. I couldn't have cared less about the relationship between Mark Wahlberg & Mila Kunis. Any opportunity to shoehorn in an f-bomb was not missed. I swear more than the average joe, but even I thought it was unnecessary and excessive. So if you're a fan of Seth McFarlane and haven't seen this yet, go pay a buck & get it out of a machine in front of the drug store."
1,I wanted to rate it 1/2 star.....,"I just rented the movie on Amazon Instant Video. I've watched about 1/2 hour of the movie and I stopped. It's not funny. The language is foul and the jokes are crude. I think it would appeal to some Jr. High students - the kind that laugh at jokes simply because they're laced with a lot of foul language. The premise of the movie is creative, but it's a shame that the writer had to go with the typical, sarcastic ""comedy"" with a ton of expletives thrown in. I take my comedy seriously and really admire someone who can make me laugh without depending on foul humor. I paid to rent the movie and lost my money on this one."
3,Acceptable if only barely funny,"Another movie were all the funny parts were in the commercials about the movie. Had one great joke at the end that we busted out laughing at, pretty sure we will be going to heck for laughing at it. But the rest of the movie wasnt overly funny. A great attempt by the family guy people but sadly not good enough for me to want to ever buy the dvd."
5,Ted,Love this movie! Love Mark Wahlberg! Of course there is always the crowd that didn't live this part of life so they probably don't think of it as funny.
2,"Fun, but too much","This movie is fun, but definetily not a family movie.Sometimes it feels like the author did too much trying to make you laugh. And those times make the worst scenes of the movie.I recommend this movie if you want to laugh a bit but don't expect too much from it."
1,painfully stupid,Was supposedly a funny movie. It was much more stupid than funny. Some of the scenes were painful to watch.
3,Just ok.,I thought this movie was just ok. It did have some very funny parts in it. I wouldn't purchase this movie because I just don't think I'd watch this movie more than once.
2,Not my kind of movie,My husband liked this more than I did. Being unrated it had a lot of sexual content and also a lot of blatant drug use. I just don't like that kind of movie. Overall I thought it was pretty stupid.
4,Lewd crude and rude and oh yeah very funny,This movie is obscene Indescent politically incorrect and one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. If you don't like this movie you have no sense of humor.
4,Funny the whole way through,"Laughed during the whole movie, towards middle to the end, it got kinda drama, but was also expecting it to."
3,Amusing... Got a little long though,"Funny but not hilarious...had moments though. Worth renting, glad I didn't pay to see it in the theater. Made for an ok evening of entertainment."
4,Very Funny,I enjoyed the movie. I found it very funny.The language was a bit on the rough side but I thought it was fine.
4,Wasn't as good as I thought it would be,"I enjoyed it at the start, and then it just got old... I have heard so many good things about it, but just didn't see it myself."
4,"Funny and crude, my Fave!","Really a funny story and well done. It was exactly what I expected from Family Guy creator Seth macfarlane. If your looking for an academy award nominee, Ted probably isn't your pick. If you want a laugh out loud raunchy non-pc movie, Ted should be right up your alley."
3,Not what I expected....,I was a bit disappointed in the film. Did not find it as funny as I found the trailer. Glad I didn't see it in the theater.
3,Some pretty funny lines in this. But all in all only OK,"Pretty funny to hear some of those things come out of a teddy bears mouth. Had a few real laugh out loud moments. I liked it considerably more than my wife did. More of a guys movie. Some of the parts that I was rolling, I looked over at my wife and she wasn't even smiling. It was funny, glad I watched it."
1,made me ashamed to be an american,"i saw this movie in a beautiful, peaceful country. i was the only american present. the kind, graceful, beautiful people of the host country found this movie ugly, vulgar, violent, and crude. most walked away from the screen, unable to understand what kind of creature could find this entertaining. i was ashamed to be an american."
1,This movie sucks,"Hollywood keeps on producing sellout rubbish.The teddy bear CGI was really well done but the only remotely funny scene in the film was the punchup between MW and TED.Plot was lame and cliche and the humour was was unoriginal, juvenille and moronic. Most of the characters were obnoxious and stupid, and most of the humour revolved around sticking fingers into a55holes, farts, d1cks, bongs, dry humping, and that freaky looking Flash gordon guy. Even Mark Walburgs GF wasnt that hot."
1,Steer Clear Of This Movie If You're Christian,"In full honesty, and I don't care what others think, this movie is unnecessarily sinful. I absolutely hate it. It's disrespectful and raunchy (extremely!) If you're Christian, don't see this!"
4,Very out of the box humor,"Everytime I thought the movie was devilving into a sappy well worn storyline, I would get abruptly surprised, turning my cynical smirk into giggles and even on occasion guffaws."
3,Decent Movie,It's pretty entertaining. I love family guy so I enjoyed the prevented random humor the movie has. It was better than I thought it would be given the premise.
2,"Amusing, but not that funny",Mark Wahlberg tooling around with Peter Griffin as a teddy bear. Pretty bad acting. A few funny one-liners. At least the leading actors work Mark and Mila.
3,Long Family Guy Episode,"If you like Family Guy, you'll love this movie. A lot of the jokes are similar to the tv show. It's entertaining."
4,Funny. Not MUCH funnier than the R-rated version though.,One of the funniest movies of 2012! The unrated version is slighter raunchier and of course less PC but not a huge difference over the R-rated version.
2,Ted,"My son recommended this movie and I know why, it's geared for the younger generation. I found it to be more a parochial movie that would be appreciated by people, mostly of the male gender, in their teens and twenties. Although I did find some of the gags funny, I got bored with it after thirty minutes. I wasn't impressed and was disappointed with Mark Wahlbergs's performance, and I love his other work."
4,"Cute, funny and rated R for a reason!",As long as you consider that a talking teddy bear is the supporting actor and it's rated R it's a fun movie.
1,Not funny,You must be a huge fan of the Family Guy show to get through this movie let alone let out a chuckle. Not funny at all!
2,Had a few funny moments,This movie has some good moments that generated a few laughs from a chuckle to a gut busting guffaw. Then it got weird and stupid.
2,Bad Family Guy Episode,"It seems that I'm the one of the few that think this movie is not so great. There were a few decent gags, but overall the vulgar sophomoric jokes did not impress me. I've always thought one of things holding Family Guy back is the obtuse and unfamiliar pop culture jokes. Seems to be plenty of that in this movie. I think the idea of the teddy bear is one that worked, and the movie did have some heart. I really think Macfarlane needed some help with the jokes though."
1,Just not funny.,"This was a really bad movie. Just not funny at all. I'm not going to waste time telling you what it's about, but I will tell you not to waste your time watching it. Seth MacFarlane has become a lazy writer, or he's just run out of fresh ideas. I would have loved the tribute to Flash Gordon, because that's one of my favorite cheezy movies of all time, but the fact that it was included in such a bad movie ruined it for me. I had to force myself to finish watching this. Twelve year olds might find it amusing, because they will get to hear dirty words and watch a teddy bear smoke pot. Should have been relegated to an SNL skit. Oh, and Marky Mark has the same cardboard charisma he has in all of his movies."
1,Poor,I love Seth's tv shows. I thought this movie would be pretty great considering the premise and Seth's involvement. His voice alone is hilarious. However this movie isn't very funny and if you're a young man thinking oo it's unrated nudity! no... not the case. It was very lacking. not worth the 3 dollars I spent renting it. I laughed a bit but overall I spent a lot of time trying to care about the characters which is not something I wanted to do. It was supposed to be stupid funny but they tried to make it stupid funny and also give it a good plot but... it just sucked.
1,Atrocious,"What garbage. Mark Wahlberg, you're better than this. Take out the ""F"" word and there would be no dialogue at all. Thank God I didn't pay full price to see it at the theater."
2,Save your money!,"This is one of the worst movies I've paid money to see in quite some time. I knew it was a marginal success in the US, but I then read in EW that it had grossed over $500 million world wide! So I figured I was wrong. NOPE!Mark Wahlberg is as hot as ever, Mila is totally beautiful, and Seth McFarlane is as funny as he is on TV - - which is the problem. He can swear in a movie, but he has put his best foot forward on TV. His imagination and creativity is absolutely amazing - but this isn't his forum. You can't force Peter Griffith inside a stuffed bear - well, you can, but that would be porn - So I'll just keep watching the original on TV. This movie totally blows - and NOT in the good way!!"
1,Not so much...,"A few laughs but not worth your time. I love juvenile humor, but this even lacked for that , just ridiculous."
4,VERY FUNNY,LOVED IT! LOVE MARK WAHLBERG HES AWESOME! ALTHOUGH NOT A MOVIE YOU WANT TO WATCH AROUND LITTLE ONES OR IMMATURE PEOPLE.
2,Not my cup of vulgarity ...,"I'll admit that I didn't know anything about this movie before renting it on Amazon. I was told it was funny, so my husband and I decided to watch.I personally found it utterly vulgar, and couldn't wait for it to end. I just don't find this sort of thing funny at all.Parents, PLEASE take heed of that rated R rating. This movie isn't for anyone under 18-years-old."
3,Big Crowd Movie,"It's predictable, but funny. You should watch it with a big group of friends to get the most out of it."
3,need to use so much drugs for entertaining?,It is entertaining but the overuse of casual drug is something that bothers me. It creates a culture that accepts lifestyle like it.
1,Dumb,I love Family Guy and I was hoping this would make me laugh out loud the same way. It has a couple funny parts but overall it's just boring and dumb. Boo. Disappointed.
2,Give me a break,"I'm no prude, but this movie really let me down. Never seen a movie with so many 4 letter words. About 1/2 was all i could take. I was raised with the teaching that people talk like that coz not smart enouph to find a better word. I'm a huge Mark Wahlberg fan. But this was uncalled for."
2,Too many 4 letter words,"This is a movie that is about a boy and a teddy bear he received for Christmas . The little boy wished that he could talk. His wish came true and he got a filthy mouthed, sexual, bong smoking bear for life. So beware, not for kids and nothing cute about it."
5,Great flick!,The funniest film that I've seen in years. I would recommend it to everyone that enjoys a good laugh comedy
4,Hilarious,"This movie will make any adult laugh. From the opening to the end, it doesn't stop. If you like family guy, you'll love this humor."
4,Entertaining,"It was good. I don't look at many movies, so one that I actually finish is normally good. Most people would enjoy it. The unrated version has a bit more questionable language than necessary, but not too excessive."
2,Ok for a rental,This movie was blah. I did not laugh as much as I assumed I would...more of a few chuckles. Glad I did not pay to see this at the movies. Watch if you are extremely bored and nothing else is on TV.
4,If you like Family Guy...,"You will definitely like this movie, it's pretty much the same thing but with live big-budget actors. Funny all the way through."
1,Gross,"This is not a funny movie, even for a viewer that practices graphic language. The humor seems to be the foul mouth of Ted. Not creative entertainment."
4,Funnier than I thought,I was so sure that all the good parts had been shown in the previews that I was skeptical going into this movie. There are so many other great parts and funny lines that you are reminded just how well of a comedic actor Mark Wahlberg is. Definitely worth the rental.
4,Pretty Good,"Pretty funny. Worth seeing, but not the funniest movie ever. And now, ten more words are required... Three, two, one."
2,the best part of this movie was in the previews,based on.the.previews I thought this movie would be funny but it ends up that the best part was the previews. if I were you id wait until its on redbox or a venue that charges less than a dollar for it.
4,Quite Funny!,"I was afraid Ted would be one of those movies where the funniest parts were what you saw in the previews and that was it. Nope! Ted was hilarious from start to finish, with some serious parts in there as well."
4,"Funny movie, just not a family movie","This is a funny movie, but don't be fooled by the teddy bear on the front cover! This is a pot smoking, sex starved teddy bear. The movie has a nice plot to it, and it is pretty funny, (in a Cheech and Chong kind of way) but I was not prepared for how much sex and drugs was going to be in it. I mistakenly let my 12 year old watch it before I had a chance to see it. That was a very bad decision on my part. I have older teenagers that had seen it in the theater, and told me it was a hilarious movie. What they neglected to tell me was that it is inappropriate for the younger kids to watch."
2,"One joke, over and over and over.","Long, pointless and after ten minutes not very funny. Previews highlighted best lines and they turned out to be squeezed into an almost two hour movie. Surprised since this movie did so well at the box office. I get Seth McFarland's humor, it's just not for me."
4,Funny,Pretty funny movie. Will watch again if I ever get a chance. Would also recommend other to see this movie.
1,Terrible,"The only reason I gaved it one star was because there is no other option for a lower rating. Sorry but it's true, this movie is the worst!"
4,Funny,have now watched it twice..my hubby was surprised when he opened it for Christmas..he can't wait till part 2 comes out..
3,Beginning was way better than the end,Beginning was way better than the end. I really enjoyed it at the beginning. Later in the movie it seem to move slowly
1,No Stars would be more appropriate,"Turned this raunchy movie off after 15 minutes. What a piece of garbage and a waste of money, even though it did not cost much."
2,Stupid! Not Recommended,"We thought we would like this movie as the commericals looked interesting. For one thing there was way too much bad language and sexual situations with the bear. We should have realized, because it was made by the same people as American Dan and I can't stand that show. Guess I expected more in a movie and find it was even worse. NOT recommended."
2,Didnt care for it,"It started out alright. But than it turn into a movie that was really horrible. Why would you make a teddy bear be so nasty and curse so much. I should have give it a 0ne, Really wasnt for me."
4,entertaining,super easy to watch and as corny as it is - it's a good clean story line with some well executed juvenile humor that most adults will appreciate.
3,It was cute but nothing special,As I said it was cute but nothing special. I think it could have been better if TED had to be kept a secret and the world found out.
3,Lots of Hype - sort of funny,"There were definitely funny moments in this movie but I'm glad I waited for it to come out on rental instead of seeing it in the theatures. I have a friend that absolutely loved it but most people I talk to feel the same way I do - a few laugh out loud moments with a cheesy ""feel-good"" ending."
4,Hilarious,Definitely not for the kids. Great raunchy flick with many unexpected moments. Definitely recommending this funny adult movie to friends.
2,Funny,Cute movie. Had very funny moments. Predictable but then what did I expect about a movie with a talking stuffed animal.
3,Funny but Dragged On,The movie was mostly funny but seemed like it was dragging on at times. Overall I would watch it again after some time has passed and I can't say that about many movies.
5,Hilarious movie!!!,I got this movie for my husband and he loves it!!! The DVD works very well and we have had no problems with it. I like that you can see the theatrical version and an unrated version. I haven't been able to view the whole movie but from what I've seen it is very hilarious!!!
3,Ted - It's an OK movie!,"I got this movie on Amazon because I had heard this is a really good comedy. I tend to like Seth Macfarlane's output. I had high hopes and this movie didn't exactly meet them. It wasn't bad by any stretch of the imagination.I liked this film really explored having a live talking teddy bear in the film. Many comedy films so unconcerned with their underlying fantastical premises that it's weird to see a movie where the screenwriters obviously had at least a fifteen or twenty minute discussion about it.Still, I wish it had been a funnier movie but it's still plenty funny and a good movie to watch after work. Look, you know what you're getting into if you watch this movie you watched the same billion trailers I did back when it came out. Just rent it or don't."
3,Just okay,Thought I would love it but it wasn't my favorite. I really wanted to like it but it was just a bit slow. Maybe cause we got the unrated version? Maybe the regular version would have had a better flow to it.
4,Funny Movie.,"Funny Movie! I have a feeling, movies will be more and more funny here in Colorado as everything kicks in."
3,Ted,I thought the movie was entertaining and funny. I don't give 4 or 5 stars to anything that I don't truly love. I would watch it again if a date wanted to.
2,Only Maginally Funny...,"This is probably just my patircular taste but I only found a few snips to be funny. I only decided to watch the movie because I had heard some coworkers talk about how funny it was and I happen to love Mark W. However, as expected I didn't care for the movie."
3,didn't live up to the hype for me,"Maybe my expectations are too hi, but there weren't as many laughs as I was hoping for. I'm a Macfarlane fan and there were great reviews on this, but it fell short for me."
3,Some great laughs in a mediocre movie,"there were some funny jokes and situations stuck inside the shell of a cliched hollywood movie. It's probably exactly what you expect it will be (if you like Seth Macfarlane's humor). But you don't have to sit through a boring love story with Family Guy, like you do with this movie."
3,Funny but not fantastic,"Some funny moments but wouldn't say I was rolling on the ground laughing. If your looking for a movie to take up a couple hours on a flight, this would be worth the rent."
3,Okay,It was okay but not that hilarious as i thought it will be! Kinda emotional towards the end. Good Work.
1,Ted,This was one of the most horrible movies I have ever seen! I'm so sorry I wasted my time and my money!
1,Good sale from the seller,however OMG what a bad movie the few thigns that were funny i saw in the previews the only thing i enjoyed was seeing my hometown on the big screen i remember when they were filming i Cant believe they are making a second one i will not be buying that one
1,Totally over the imaginary talking creature humor,This movie had some minimal laughs in it nothing special tho. I gave it 1 star because I paid $5 to watch it. If it came on Encore or Netlifx or something and I didn't have to shell out additional money to view it would have bumped it up to 2-3 stars. not worth renting in my opinion.
1,Do not like,Not a good movie - speechless. Definetly Adult view only and not sure if Adults can stand watching much less listening to the strong accent.
3,Not as hoped,It may have been nothing more than my expectations were too high. I usually enjoy Seth Macfarlane's humor but this movie seemed like it was more interested in shock value. I'm not adverse to vulgar humor but all in all I just did not find this movie that funny.
4,Ted not expected,"Not what you really expect, but with a wrapped sense of humor this movie is very good. If you can not take a joke don't watch it, if you ever had a Bear that you liked it is worth watchibng"
2,Funny Moments but Overall Not very Good,"The movie has some very funnt moments, but overall it just isn't very good. A solid two stars, maybe two and a half."
2,very foul,"It was not a good movie, the language was horrible,there was not 10 min that went without a 5 sec cuss fest, if it was free would not watch it again..."
2,Not for those with reason,Just a vulgar movie with no reason to have been made except for those who have no other interests. Good acting but wasted.
2,Can't believe mark and mila made this movie,Dumb....just dumb! Can't get those two hours of my life back! Thought it would be funny and maybe it is if you are high when you watch it????
3,"A few laughs, that's all.","A movie about a teddy bear ""R"" rated. Seriously? There are a few funny lines but don't expect much and you won't be disappointed."
2,Disappointing,"From the guy that brought you family guy comes a mildly amusing film about a bear who comes alive. The premise is ridiculous yes but I expected that the script would echo the absurdity of it all. How is that a teddy bear comes alive and NO ONE is fazed by that in the absolutely ridiculous world that is built around it.The bear sounds like Peter from Family Guy, which is understandable as its the same person who wrote and created the characters on the show.The movie played out like some of the Family Guys as of late, the potential to be funny is there, but it misses its mark. Cherry Chevapravatdumrong, one of the original writers of Family Guy, wrote some of the best episodes that I can remember about the show and she should have had her hand in writing this script.The movie was unimaginative and totally predictable in a 80s theme style movie. Down to the childhood hero appearance. What a waste. I got 3 laughs out of the movie and they were just chuckles."
2,Meh.,"very formulaic and not very funny. Disappointed because I like Mark Wahlberg, Mila Kunis and Seth Macfarlane. Glad I didn't pay to see it in the theater."
1,awful movie,"I thought this was the WORST movie i've ever seen in my life. Horrible and painful to watch! (although to be fair, my husband liked and thought it was pretty funny)"
2,Ted,"It could have been funnier; the crude language and the fake Boston accent really was terrible. I managed to watch the entire movie, reason why I'm giving it two stars instead of one."
2,All the funny parts are in the trailers...,"I had so much hope for this movie. The trailers were hilarious and I LOVE Seth McFarlane. But, sadly, the ONLY funny parts were in the trailers. Save your money for when it comes on cable. I'm really glad I didn't pay to see it in the theaters."
4,cool,this movie was quite hilarious. it is a good movie to watch when you want a good comedy. i would definitely recommend it
4,What friendship is all about,"This was a suprisingly funny video about growing up with a live person like Teddy bear. It was real in the sense that the bear is just a regular guy and true to life best friend as any one would have, except he's a teddy bear. I laughed from beginning to end. And loved the ending as well when what life is about and best friendships come together. I loved it. Two thumbs up!"
4,"Very Adult, Very Funny, And Highly Watchable","What maybe should have been purely juvenile adolescent humor and fun (and it is that don't get me wrong) is almost deep a time or two as well. It's not the greatest film ever, and it won't change your life, but for what it is and what it tried to do, it succeeded. Plus, Flash Gordon and Sam J. Jones? Yeah that's a big part of my childhood and I marked out like a kid again. Loved this movie."
2,Not what I expected for content,"This video although funny, went a bit over the top. It lacked story line and tried to make up for it in shock value."
3,Very Funny,If you don't mind constant cussing and crude talk this movie is for you. Some of the scenes are really funny and many others a pretty dumb.
3,Not as funny as I thought it would be,Friends had tole me that this was a great movie and I usually like all comedies but I just didn't see the humor in this one.
4,Good.,"It's a pretty good movie. Not as good as I thought that it would be from what I had heard from other people. Overall it has a couple very funny parts in the movie, and is a movie I would recommend for adults with a sense of humor."
2,WILFRED Rip-Off(ish),"Bleh! This movie was terrible...First, it destroyed my opinion on Teddy Rupskin. Second, I am going to assume that Mark Wahlberg was forced to take this movie because I want to continue to have respect for him as an actor (on the other hand, this is a step up for Mara S. from that 70's show). Third, it was pretty bad...actually, very bad. I am saddened MW--step your game back up or go back to being half naked in action movies. That is all."
3,The Commercials were funnier.,"Bought this for my husband for our anniversary and was quite excited to see it, it was cute... very funny as well but was expecting more raw humor then an actual emotional plot that killed my nice laugh I had through the movie. Don't get me wrong the funny parts will make you giggle and squirm with glee just the emotional parts are like noooooooooooo! Whyyyyyyyyyy!? But I did enjoy it, just wasn't what all I expected. I would say we would watch it again and we might, but its been 3 months and still sitting on the self. Maybe would of been better to try redbox first."
1,A missed opportunity,"The idea for the movie is great - a teddy bear that comes alive, is a life-long friend and circumstances change causing problems. While it was always going to be a comedy, the movie falls into a barrage of crass nonsense almost from the start and never recovers. Clearly as the unrated version it was always going to have below-the-belt humor, but the director lost his way early on. He forgot about the story and tried to make every scene as offensively funny as possible instead. He failed completely. The movie Borat is one of the few movies that (sort of) got away with this type of approach. Ted (the unrated version anyway) fails completely.Don't waste your money."
1,horribly disappointing,"hI had to rate it with something...or else there wouldn't be any stars. I thought I would spend my night being sick enjoying something funny. TED is not the movie for that. In fact, it's not a movie worth anybody's time. The idea, I'll admit, is cute. The execution is vulgar and horribly done. It makes me very worried for the future of Hollywood and the kind of comedic films being produced these days....just awful. I DO NOT recommend this."
1,REALLY? They only got me for 10 Minutes. Ha Ha Ha.,"Kinda' reminded me of the older Eddie Murphy movies... You know, whitty wise guy that can't act but has plenty of cheap whitty wise guy cracks. Then the sequal comes out and it's ...you know, whitty wise guy that can't act but has plenty of cheap whitty wise guy cracks. Then his newest movie comes out and ...you know, whitty wise guy that can't act but has plenty of cheap whitty wise guy cracks.....................I think you get it by now.I WANT MY 10 MINUTES BACK :("
1,the movie is redicilous,Never let your under age kids watch it. The movie is dissapointing. The plot and language is discusting and cheap....
1,Not Funny!!,"I really do not understand what everyone was looking at that rated this movie more than two stars, because this picture was less than funny it was down right horrible and full of nothing but explicit language."
1,This movie is horrible,"This may be the worst movie ever made, or at least the worst I've ever seen. I think it is truly sick to take a child's toy and turn it into a semi-pornographic movie. Many stupid parents would let their kids watch without ever even checking this out just because it is about a teddy bear."
2,"If you like family guy type humor, you might like this one.....otherwise you will think it was a terrible movie like I did","If you like family guy type humor, you might like this one.....otherwise you will think it was a terrible movie like I did"
3,"eh, maybe too much hype","I couldn't wait to see this. In fact, we had it on Netflix list and since it was snowing, we decided to pay for the rental. It maybe that there was too much hype prior to seeing it, but I didn't think it was all that great. Yes, it had very funny moments, but I don't think I'd be quoting the lines. In my opinion, it is definitely NOT another Hangover. I'll stick to watching that over and over."
2,Not for kids!,"I watched this movie because the K-2 kids I work with all saw it and said it was funny. Well, I would NEVER let a child watch this with all the terrible language and sexual situations - what were you thinking putting a cute bear in a near-porn movie?? The story line was predictable and nothing new at all - sorry but it made Mark Wahlberg look like an idiot."
2,TED was stuffed with slut and obscenities,"I should have known better with Seth McFarlane, but Ted looked so innocent and fun in the trailers I couldn't resist. The animation was awesome, but the story dragged along at times like Ted's sorry plush derriere and the human acting was mediocre at best. By the end I was pooped (that's in the movie too) and not uplifted or refreshed after any big laughs, because there weren't any. If you like unending obscenities and scatalogical humor this movie is for you."
2,A near miss,"I was so ready for a good laugh, and this movie had such a good premise. Yet it just went to far for me, and I consider myself ridiculously open minded for a grown adult. With a way too crude sense of humor. Yet this movie still missed the mark of being funny. I guess these days there are absolutely no boundaries that kids don't mind. There were some very funny moments, and I didn't stop watching it. But in the end I didn't think too much of this movie."
2,Once again...,"...the previews showed the only parts of the movie that were actually funny. I was expecting a movie that would keep me laughing; instead, my husband and I spent the first half hour or so wondering when the movie was going to really get funny. I'm glad we didn't pay movie theater prices to see this one."
2,highly disappointed,"Thought it was going to be much funnier than it was. Funny parts, just an ok movie. Wouldn't watch again"
2,Sophomoric humor,"The cameos in this movie saved it from being a complete failure. I thought the premise was completely moronic and found little to no redeeming value at all. If you can watch it for free then it might be worth your time, but I wouldn't pay more than $0 for it."
2,Overrated!,It did not have a good story line and I did not think it was that funny. The previews basically showed all the funny parts.
1,Terrible,"This was the worst movie I've seen in a long time,it could and should have been a really cute movie if they would've made it so dirty.There were parts we could watch,if I didn't have to pay for it I would stopped it,terrible.I would not care to see it again."
1,Disappointing,This movie was enjoyable for the first 15 minutes then it tapered down to a stereotypical comedy with very little that was entertaining.
5,SUper funny!,What a hilarious comedy! I loved it so much. Can't wait to watch it again and again! Great plot and great ending!
3,What was Mark Wallberg thinking?,The movie is pretty juvenile. If you like a lot of potty mouth and not much plot then this is for you.
1,Couldn't Finish Watching,"We rented this and found it so boring and UN-funny that we stopped watching it less than a quarter of the way through. It wasn't humorous. It might have worked as a short sketch on SNL or something and been funny that way, but as an entire movie, it just didn't work for me at all. The humor is crass, it was a lot of sex jokes and cursing and drug references, just for the sake of... well, not humor, because it wasn't humorous.There simply wasn't anything redeeming about it that made it worth finishing. My son (who is 18) usually loves watching crass shows like this, and even he found it quite boring and just... dumb. I actually tried to see if I could get my money back on the rental, and I never do that--that's how bad this movie was."
1,"Dirty mouthed teddy bears - not my cup,of tea","We heard this was funny and rented it. After about ten minutes, we decided we had better things to do than watch a bong-hitting bear (or whatever you do with bongs!) say 4-letter words. My recommendation: skip it."
1,Disappointment,"I really looked forward to this movie - the reviews were hilarious. I watched it with my 24 yr. old son, who (surprisingly) was disappointed in it too. The beginning of the movie was cute and funny, but after the boy and bear grew up it turned into a sad, unsuccessful attempt at extremely crude and tasteless humor."
4,GRIN AND BEAR IT,"TED has some really hilarious moments and writer/director/co-star Seth McFarlane spares no one in his often crude script. Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis are surprisingly effective, as is McFarlane's motion-capture as the rambunctious title character. Some fun cameos from Norah Jones, Sam Jones, Tom Skerritt and Ryan Reynolds. Giovanni Ribisi, Patrick Warburton and Joel McHale provide good supporting moments.TED is not a great movie but you will find yourself laughing a lot before the guilt settles in."
1,This is entertainment?,"We chose to watch this film because Wahlberg can be funny and the concept COULD have been entertaining. HOWEVER, this is an uneven, poorly constructed tale that panders to the basest instincts. Sad and pathetic. Save your $$$$$."
2,Disappointing,"I heard this movie was surprisingly touching. I thought it was more like a typical, by-the-boiler-late buddy comedy, but just with a talking bear replacing the human buddy. And the bear talked like the dad from ""Family Guy"" and yeah, I kow it's Seth McFarlane. But the accent and tone were similar so I kept thinking of Peter. Kinda annoying."
1,Just not my type of film,"I was expecting more than toilet humor. I'm not a fan of these types of films, but I thought I was going to get a bit more laughs in this one than other films like hot tub time machine or the hang over, which I very much disliked.Other people like this type of genre but its just not for me, and unfortunately the film ended up being mostly potty humor. I ended up fast forwarding a good chunk of this, probably 60% or more after it became evident I just wasnt going to find laughs here."
2,Boring Pot Head Movie,"If you enjoy Pot this movie is for you! If you don't enjoy pot this movie is not for you. Boring, slow, and I had a very hard time finishing this movie. Ted sounds to much like family guy and I had a hard time getting over that too."
1,hate it,i did not like this movie there was nothing funny about this movie mark wahlberg can do better then this. yes th previews to this movie were funny but after i watch it. the movie was just down right stupid.
4,Pretty good stuff,"It was a decent movie with some hilarious parts. All told it's definitely worth a rental at least, a great movie to watch with friends."
2,Wouldn't watch it again,"This movie was extremely raunchy. Some parts were funny, but some were over the top. Would not watch it again. And any women dating a man with a raunchy talking teddy bear would just kill herself at some point"
2,I guess I have finally grown up,I watched the unrated version with my wife and we both hated Ted. First off I am ok with the idea of a raunch talking teddy after all I watch Wilfred and love that show so I am ok with the idea of Ted. I just felt Ted the character was not funny nor was the character well developed and I would have liked to see Ted take the rauchiness further. I also had trouble with Teds voice since it was done by Seth McFarland I kept thinking I was watching a boring episode of family guy. The plot was somewhat predictible nothing to write home about. I have recently seen some Adam Sandler movies and been disappointed so perhaps my tastes are maturing as I get older but Ted did very little for me or my wife. However two younger people in my office (early 20's) loved the movie and qoute it all day long and sing the Thunder Buddies song at least once a week.
2,Thunder Buddy,The Thunder Buddy song was the only redeeming factor of this movie. And Marky Mark's Boston accent grated on my nerves.
2,Not to my taste in movies,"Some funny parts but they are few and far between and I found the characters to be basically unlikeable. I find little interesting in slacker, stoner, stupid, ignorant, lazy, characters."
4,Really funny,"it is great movie, I love the voice of ted ""peter"" gives the movie good taste of humor. ;) ;)"
5,Funny!,"Pretty dang funny. Of course, since it's a Seth McFarlane movie, be prepared for a lot of references that you may or may not really get, but it doesn't detract from just how hilarious it is."
3,Funny but lacked some consistency.,I enjoyed this movie very much but I watched the trailer for the movie before renting it from amazon prime and much to my disappointment there wasn't a whole lot of epically entertaining scenes aside from what was highlighted in the trailers.
1,Not Good,"As someone who watches and enjoys Family Guy - this was not good. I imagine the first screenplay meeting went like this:""OK Guys, we have 2.5 hours of unrestricted joke time. Everybody write down 4 of your favorite jokes or crudest thoughts.""5 minutes later - ""OK let's collect them up. Joe, you shuffle them. Mike, lay them out in order and fill in the blanks with whatever lame storyline you can come up with.""20 minutes later - ""Done? Good. Let's start filming.""Crude just to be crude is not that funny after the first 10 minutes. 2 hours of it is painful."
1,it was disappointing,"i was very disappointed with Ted, pretty much the only good parts were the parts from the commercial, the rest of the time, i wasn't impressed at all"
1,Stupid,"This movie was just plain ignorant. Unless you like a talking teddy bear smoking pot, it is awful. We were so disappointed that we didn't make it past 45 minutes."
2,A few laughs but disappointed overall,"I really wanted to like this movie but it fell short in my opinion. While some may find the language and other material offensive, it's on par with other movies in the similar category. Really the only funny parts are the parts that contain offensive material to sensitive viewers (so they would not find these parts funny like myself).Anyways, I'd pass on this one if you can help it. I wish I had."
5,Hilarious,Exactly as my friends described this movie. It came with both the theatrical and unrated versions on the same disc.
3,Just ok,Nothing too great in this movie. A few good laughs but overall it was not as funny as I expected.
3,"Worth $2, not much more.","I'm glad I didn't see it in the theatre, but it's worth skipping the trip to Redbox to watch it on Amazon."
1,"Ted: Filthy, Dirty, Trash.","A friend of mine thought this was a funny movie and recommended it. This friend is a fine individual, but he uses the F.. word liberally. This guy has a Ph.D. and owns an IT company. I feel like asking him how on earth could have found this piece of garbage worth his time. Nonetheless, I started watching this movie, and could not get very far. I had to turn if off. What a bunch of utter vulgar trash! This is not what I consider good entertainment. I love good comedy, but not this kind of thing. There should be zero star, as this thing deserves a zero, even < 0! I suggest that you don't waste your time or money on this one."
1,Worst movie ever,If you've seen the trailer than consider it the best part of the movie what a complete waist of time and money
1,A silly movie for silly people,"the movie seems targeted at juvenile 35 year old males, and was a great disappointment. If you were not a child of the 80s this film is probably not for you."
5,Stupid Funny,"This movie was stupid funny. It was what I expected. It was sooooo silly, but fun. I enjoyed the movie."
2,Not good!,"My 18 yr old saw this at the theater and came home raving about it. So I pre-ordered it for him. Just watched it.....It was the most tedious movie ever. And TED was no more that Peter from Family Guy in teddy bear form. Just more gross. The writing was so so and the plot seemed all over the place.If you must see it, wait for HBO to show it."
1,Disappointed,"Well shame on me for not checking into this movie more before renting it, but made through about 15-20 minutes of this movie and just turned it off. Sophmoric, boring attempts at humor, etc., etc. Take Family Guy dad and substitute Teddy Bear for his character and bunch of real humans instead of the other characters, then a script that is too long and brainless for even a Family Guy episode and your mind immediately starts thinking about all the other things you could be doing besides watching this lame movie. You're better of watching a movie you like even if you have seen it 20 times."
3,Meh...,"Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of ""Family Guy"" and I do enjoy Seth McFarlane's humor. I guess I just found this movie a bit stale after an hour and a half. This movie does have some pretty funny moments, but it just didn't achieve the ""classic"" status that I expected it to."
2,wasn't as good as expected,I was expecting a funnier movie. It wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be. Disappointed entirely.
1,Not funny. Don't waste your money or time.,Not funny. Kept waiting to laugh. Waste of our money and date night at home! Can't believe mila kunis did this film and they are trying to make another one. So over the top obnoxious and dumb. Guess am too old for this crap.
1,Sophmoric,Wow - I probably could have written a better script when I was a sophmore in high school. Didn't enjoy it at all. Stopped the movie half way through and had no desire to watch the rest. Goes to show that anyone can write a movie these days.
3,The streaming quality was not great. The movie was Awesome!,The movie would buffer quite often making it annoying to watch. This has not happened with other movies streamed so I know it is not an internet issue.
5,Amazingly delightful!,I expected this to be somewhat stupid but was delighted at the humor and life situations in the movie. This is definitely a keeper.
3,"The plot is sweet, however very crude","I found this movie to be not as funny as expected. The story is great, a kid and his teddy bear being his only friend and such but all the cussing and crude humor was a little much. The bear sounds like peter griffin and Mr. Punishment rolled up into one, kind of hard to see it as a movie in itself and not another episode of family guy. The comedy was good at the beginning but got very old after awhile. If they would have improved the comedy and cut out the stale jokes it could have been a fun movie."
3,Not for Kids,Raunchy buddy flic with a funny concept and some humerious situations and lines. Not very well acted but good special effects.
3,"Pretty good, I thought it would be funnier.","It was pretty funny overall. What it really seemed like to me was basically a live action Family Guy movie. Which was not upsetting at all because as I said, overall it was pretty funny."
1,don't watch it,Awful they should have paid us to see it. A total bust unless you like mindless rude things and that is that
3,Average at best,The bear is funny. But most of the funny stuff was in the commercials. Not sure why it's received so much hype as being one of the funniest movies ever - not even close.
3,Ted,its great if you are a horney teen age boy with all the boobie shots. Ted had some funny lines but seriously-constant pot smoking? We get the picture after the first clip.
5,Fun,"We enjoyed this movie. It's fun and cute and we laughed a lot. No, it won't win an Oscar but it was an entertaining watch."
3,Expected a little more,Confused as whether it was a comedy or rude chic-flick. There were some funny spots but mostly I found myself trying to laugh.
3,Barely Okay and not as funny as everyone said it would be...,"This movie was just okay in my book. It started out rather funny, but soon lost its appeal. Lots of expected dirty humor, a teddy bear with no ""apparatus"" that was a sex-crazed maniac, and a plot line that cost me far too many brain cells.Save this one for the party with the guys that drink a LOT of beer and wait until they are quite far gone and it may be passable.Amazon's delivery was perfect as always!"
4,"Instant classic, but would've been better with a more age appropriate male lead","Great movie! It was fun to see Wahlberg and Macfarlane team up, but the movie might've worked better with an Ashton Kutcher, Justin Timberlake, or Scott Caan."
2,ted,It was just to silly for us. There are better movies he has done and many better to watch. Silly.
1,Very Disappointed,"We didn't finish watching ""Ted"" because of the language and content. Bad language, bad acting, but we shouldn't have expected anything different from Seth MacFarlane. They did such a great job putting the trailer together that we were sucked in."
2,disappointment,I did not like this movie because I felt it went way overboard on the cursing. Way way overboard past where it was funny. I guess I was expecting more from what I saw on the advertisements. The last fifteen to twenty minutes started to get better and I enjoyed the end of the movie. Would not recomend this to anyone. Almost total Disappointment.
4,"Laughed so hard, great funny movie","Seth Farland did it again. I loved this movie, it was so funny and also so touching. It is not a kids movie, this is aadult movie, I saw the unrated one. I will purchase this in the future. thanks"
3,"Alright, not great","There were a few good funny parts, but overall, it was a bit cheesy. Maybe I just didn't like the talking bear, but you might like it!"
3,A Simple Funny Movie ala Seth McFarland,This movie definitely feels like a live version of Seth McFarland's Family Guy series. Very similar humor and jokes plus he tends to lean more towards the 80's in his references. So if you're a Family Guy fan then give this movie a view. A good funny time to be had.
3,Tepid Ted,"The basic idea for the plot was interesting, but the director took the story down the same old tired path by injecting low level humor into the plot. I am not certain if this was Mark Wahlberg's first foray into comedy movies, but he should have been more selective on the movies he picks in the future. There are several funny parts to the movie, the fight in the motel room comes to mind."
3,OK at best,"Would give it 2 1/2 if that was allowed. It had it's moments, but they were too far between. Mostly it was just silly and the characters weren't particularly likable."
4,Ted at Home,I like the fact that when rented you can replay it for 48 hours. Play back was good with no buffering.
2,Disappointing,"Knew it was a silly concept to begin with but then for the rating it received, I was hoping that it would provide a reasonable amount of entertainment. It was disappointing at best!"
2,Not impressed.,"Was disappointed with this movie. Sorry, but I guess I wasn't in the mood for the type of humor is used. Guess it wasn't the Christmas miracle I expected."
4,Good movie.,Slapstick comedy. Typical of Seth McFarland. Although it is funny it doesn't leave you suprised in any ways. A good watch.
2,"OK, some funny parts.","If you still enjoy getting stoned, you will probably like this movie. I would recommend making sure your good and stoned before you hit play."
4,Hilarious and disturbing,"I can't look at my teddy bears the same. I like ""Ted"", but its a humor that I think can hit or miss some audiences. Ted owns the show...Mark Wahlberg was ok. I am not use to Mark in this type of genre."
3,A little disappointing,"I didn't enjoy as much as I expected to - perhaps the mood I was in. Laughed a few times, but not my type of humor I guess."
1,Leaves much to be desired,"I was told that this was a very funny movie, I was misled, it isn't close to being funny. It's stupid and I should have realized that before I bought it but I used to think that the person who recommended it had some degree of intelligence. I guess I was mistaken. This would be a good movie for children if it weren't for all of the profanity. Actually it sort of bridges the gap between being a good children's movie and a bad adult movie, or maybe not. If you are thinking about buying it, don't."
3,It was ok but kept messing up while streaming,It was alright but it messed up a few times while playing which made me a little disappointed because of how much I paid to rent it
4,Funny,"Great movie, full of jokes. The plot isn't the greatest, but the conept of the film and the delivery of the jokes is nothing but hilarious."
2,slow download kept buffering,Great internet connection but kept buffering and freezing. Paid extra for HD version and was informed AFTER purchase that it would not show in HD if slow connection etc. Most of the movie was not in HD. Will just rent from Redbox or Apple TV. Apple TV at least downloads enough before start to watch without buffering. The movie itself was decent
3,Not horrible. Lots of good one liners,Loser and his teddy bear get a girl and almost lose her...lots of good one liners but that's about it.
2,Fake Reviews - Do NOT Believe the positive reviews,"This movie is not the worst I have ever seen. It is maybe a 2.5. It isn't very funny, maybe if your 12. I was deceived by the positive ratings, every other place where this movie is rated it gets terrible reviews. When I read in one of the other reviews ""Funniest Movie I Have Ever Seen"" realized that this person must have been paid for his review."
1,family guy re-hashed,"If you like fart jokes, you will like Ted. If you are sophomoric, you will enjoy Ted. If you have absolutely no taste in movies, you will like Ted"
3,Boring,"Thought it would be funnier - glad I waited to ""rent"" rather than see this in the theater. It's okay"
3,"Not Bad, Not Great","was simply okay, the clips shown on the trailers pretty much touched on all the ""best"" parts of the movie"
2,A few laughs,"To me, an episode of Family Guy is better than this whole movie. It works when you're in a stupid mood, but there's no point in re-watching this movie."
4,Very funny,"Of course it's got a lot of Family Guy humor and you could even see a few FG animated characters personified in this movie, but it made me laugh quite a bit. Which is a lot more than any other comedy movie I have seen in the last three or four years. Thumbs up!"
4,Mostly good,"Pretty funny until the last 45 minutes or so. Something from Seth McFarland tends to be hilarious and have an unusual twist at the end. Instead of a funny twist, you get 45 minutes of wasted film."
4,Funny,Funny movie. I would watch it again. Not quite the story line I expected but still worth watching. Good movie.
1,Sucked bad!!,"This movie was nothin but stupid from begining to the end. If you watched the trailers, you seen the movie. Just hated this movie!"
1,Teddy bears should not talk like that,Seth MacFarlane is running out of good material. This movie is pushing the envelope trying to be funny and its obvious. I would judge anyone who says they like this movie.
2,a horribly bad choice,"My sister told me to check this film out because she liked it & thought it was funny. This movie is about as funny as a woman getting fisted by a lions paw while getting a colonic. I mean it wasn't funny, not even weirdly funny. It's just weird & stupid. The older Seth McFarlane gets, the more stupid he becomes. The first season of family guy was good, but since then he's delivered nothing but FCC approved soft-core pornographic garbage! If I'm gonna see a porno, I want to know it's a porno first. Don't try to surprise the audience with things that should be labeled adult instead of the R rating they've given."
1,CRude,"We are not prude people, but the language in this movie just would not stop. Maybe it was our sense of humor but wow it was over the top."
1,Not even close to a must see!,"This movie is a classic example of what makes ""old movies"" so popular today. To bill this as a ""must see movie of 2012"" is pure promotional hype and BS. It's not funny, crude for the sake of being crude is not comedy, it is just crude. Mark is capable of such great product, this is not that. I love good comedy, even raunchy comedy up to a point. Don't put this on if there are anychildren present, as in the same neighborhood, even if those children are well over 21. Could not finish watching this. Worst part, it wasn't funny it was pathetic. Next to Killer Joe this is the worst movie since Machete."
1,Atrocious!!!,"I rented this movie expecting a movie that would provide a few good laughs. The language and vulgarity in this movie was just beyond what any reasonable movie watcher would expect...a few off-color jokes would have been fine, but it was one after the other after the other...the movie was not worth renting for any reason."
1,Pure Dreck!,"This movie is a waste of good talent and money. It promotes the use of illegal drugs and poor relationships to the youth of this country. The produces of this movie should look to their own children ask themselves, Is this a lifestyle I would like them to acquire."
1,TED a terrible movie.,"This is perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen. Just plain stupid and not at all funny, just trash.Besides that. I was charged for it twice on my second day of my 30 day free trial and payment for Prime. The first itme I tried to view it, there was no sound. The second time, I could not believe such a movie was highly rated by so many."
3,"funny, but with a few misses","Shock Humor. With many moments that were way over the top. When the topic wasnt funny, it made it really awkward to watch. Less random, however, than family guy."
3,Essentially an extra long Family Guy episode,"Typical fare from Seth Macfarlane, a mix of 80s humor, stereotype jokes, and occasional shock humor. The movie had several funny moments but really is no different from the TV show. The fact that Ted sounds exactly like Peter Griffin and Mila Kunis is in it as well did not help disguise the fact. If you like Family Guy you will probably enjoy it, but if you no longer find Family Guy edgy then this will be a long movie."
3,Silly Funny!,This movie was funny! But not THAT funny...we are so glad we waited for the rental and didn't pay $20 to see it at the theatre!!
2,Teenage boy humor,"Mostly about sex, farts and other things that are boldly un-PC. Hate to admit that it made me laugh. A couple of touching moments."
3,Boston accents are funny...,"It's amusing but, not as funny as I was expecting. I am glad I didn't see this at the theater."
4,Funny Movie- Mila Kunis Russian Goddess,"Pretty funny movie...if you like Seth Mcfarlane's humor. At least he didn't try to get all political. Unlike most of these types of theme comedy, it didn't get old by the first half hour. And oh yeah- Mila Kunis is a Russian Goddess!!"
4,Funny,"I thought this movie was hilarious. At first I didn't think it was going to be any good and as movie went on, it was totally funny.I recommend this comedy. I gave it 4 stars because I liked it."
2,Ted,Why does most of Mark Wahlberg's movies HAVE to have the F-BOMB in them? Otherwise this would have been an enjoyable movie!
1,I cant believe I would say this but....I expected more from Markey Mark,"I would say this movie was childish but then again children cant see a movie with a bear dropping the f-bomb and snorting lines of coke. The simplicity of the humor makes ""Half baked"" look like a Moonlight Sonata by comparison and really there was no plot what so ever. If you think a teddy bear smoking a joint can ntertain you for an hour and a half....this movie id for you."
2,Should have known better,"The movie is perfect if you are a high school boy, but if you are looking for a good date movie with your wife, keep looking. While the family guy is somewhat entertaining, putting the same humor in a film was disturbing."
3,Worth watching,"Funny enough that it was worth watching. The unrated version is definitely not for children, not sure about the rated version."
1,Too vaguer,"The story line was good, but I found the language vaguer. Because of the teddy bear young kids would think it OK to watch"
3,"watchable, but not as funny as we expected",more of a 2$ or less movie. at least there were a few boobs. and ryan reynolds for the wife.
2,Blah,"All the funny parts? You have already seen them on the previews and trailer. In fact, just watch the trailer. It's free."
3,NOT A CUTE MOVIE AS EXPECTED. Raunchy language etc.,The movie is full of raunchy language and a ton of drug related scenes. Its very adult oriented as I expected but over the top in foul language and abuse. It would of been much better if toned down some. Not a very good Wahlberg movie considering his previous ones. Gen Y half high will probably love it though.
4,Damn the previews,"because the big jokes are spoiled, you've seen them. But enough remains, the smaller laughs to hold the viewer. Boston looks good. It is worth the time."
3,over hyped,the movie was funny but i think i would have found it more entertaining if i wasn't expecting to roll on the floor laughing.
4,Funny stuff.,Not the makings of an academy award winner... but a solid effort by Seth McFarlane.Mila Kunis is a happy bonus.
1,don't bother,Foul language was atrocious & absolutely unnecessary. Plot was senseless. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb. Below juvenile. Dumb.
4,Ted,"VERY funny movie and NOT a movie for younger children, but VERY funny actors and actresses. Highly suggest this movie"
2,Generous 2 stars.,"I am being generous to give it 2 stars. There were funny parts, but mostly just ridiculous. Risqu√©, off color or just silly does not always translate into humor."
4,An absurd presentation you can't help but laugh at!,"Seth MacFarlane always has a way of making me laugh even if I feel bad about it later. As an adult with an irreverent sense of humor I find genius in Seth MacFarlane's talents. This story of a young boy turned ""adult"" and his come to life Teddy Bear who both resemble the perpetual college roommates with nary a stated major. The multi-talented Mark Wahlberg fits the part very well and is truly believable as this guy with a gorgeous and exceptionally tolerant girlfriend (Mila Kunis) who always falls to the peer pressures of his life-long support system who is TED.This movie is certainly not for kids as the language, adult situations, and pure absurdity could leave scars in tender young minds! Have you not seen ""Family Guy""?"
2,Stupid movie,This movie was wraunchy. Not my type of movie. Not sure what I thought we would be watching but I wish I had never spent the money it took to rent it. It was a good concept that could have been presented more pleasantly than constant swearing and turning a cute teddy into a perv.
5,Best Movie Ever,I love this movie. I wish I had a talking Teddy Bear that should like Peter Griffin. I hope to get this for Christmas
4,Every Little Boy's Fantasy,"I think we've all wished for a best friend like this. I would say that it's not for children, but for pre-teens and older, it's a must see."
3,"Funny parts, overall ok","I was expecting it to be a little funnier longer.. If that makes sense.. The beginning was funny and it ended on a warm fuzzy note. Maybe it's one of those movies that's funnier when you're intoxicated? Overall just ok IMO. I wouldn't rent it again/buy the movie, but I'm not mad I did."
5,PISSED MY PANTS LAUGHING,WORTH THE WAIT CANT WAIT TILL TED 2 COMES OUT.....HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ALL THAT HAVE A SENESE OF HUMOR
5,Awesome,Loved it. Funniest bear since Yogi. Not a kids movie so don't be fooledWhy do I need 18 words on her?
4,Like Watching family guy the movie,"If you like watching Family Guy and that type of humor, Ted is like watching the live action version, but with cursing."
4,Was worth watching it for the Thunder Buddy Song alone,Fairly silly movie but fun nonetheless. Standard buddy movie with the girlfriend breaking them apart with added weirdness of the bear.
3,TED,Blu ray disk was good. I was surprise by the movie. I was expecting more comedy. Definitely not for kids...
3,Not very funny,"The previews for this movie shown in promotions were the only funny parts of the movie. While I found the movie entertaining, I think, minus the adult language and content, it would be a better PG or PG 13 movie."
2,sucked.,"I had heard great things about this movie from many people - let me just say, DISAPPOINTED. I laughed out loud probably once during the whole movie. Cursing isnt really funny (and this movie was foul with it), and the emotional plot line was lame, especially since this was supposed to be a comedy. Would not recommend it to anyone unless they were someone like the character that Mark wahlberg played in this movie. Dumb and Dumber is one of my favorite movies, so I can't say I don't like slapstick stupid comedy, but this was just....bad."
3,Ted,All i have to say is.. meh. It's ok. the funny is average or less. I liked the personality given to the bear.
3,Not my type of humor,"I watched this movie because my wife wanted to watch something funny, and we both heard good things about this movie. But, everyone has a different sense of humor, and I didn't find the movie all that funny. Maybe if you like Will Ferrel movies this will make you laugh non-stop, but for me the laughs were pretty far between. I actually got the biggest laughs from the movie using other movies' soundtracks in important moments."
3,It was ok,There were parts that were very funny and the animation with combining with people was good but some of the language was not necessary. Seemed like the writer got carried away with being vulgar.
3,It okay,"A bit too long, but funny parts. Not great, not bad. Enjoyable. Helps to be a big fan of Seth MacFarlane."
2,Disappointed,"I really like Mark Wahlberg, but I gotta say I was a little disappointed in this movie. If it had been cleaned up it would have made a wonderful childrens movie."
2,Trailer = Movie,"Its just the same joke over. Its funny at first, but it gets old real quick. If you have seen the trailer, you have seen the movie."
2,For immature people....,Very immature type sense of humor...it had a few (very few) kind'a funny moments but 30minutes was all we could take...F minus for us.....
2,Pedestrian,This wasn't nearly as funny as it was cracked up to me. The racist jokes sounded a little less tongue and cheek even when coming from the mouth of an animatronic teddy bear vs. Peter Griffin. Not worth it.
2,"Had its moments, funniest bits were in the preview","This movie had its moments but overall I'm glad I only spent $4 to watch it on Amazon. The funniest parts were all in the previews. The flash gordon story line was really stupid and all of the cameos felt forced. I like dumb comedies, but this one was a little too dumb for my tastes."
4,Funny!!,The movie was super funny!! I wish i had a bear like TED...I will watch it again soon. Mark is a great actor in all his movies!!
3,Don't know why I expected more,"I thought I read a review by Roger Ebert that this was a really good film, but I just never got that same feeling. Mark was a nice enough guy, and Ted was absurdly crass, but I just kept thinking that their hijinks were more sad than funny. I mean, who could jeopardize their relationship by leaving a party to go to another party and expect to not be caught? The humor was more silly than genuinely funny is what it boils down to, and the relationship was as unrealistic as the talking bear."
5,So funny,"My husband and I loved it! Good movie, not for kids. Find a sitter. Not much more to say than that."
3,Too Much Hype,"I am a fan of Seth McFarlane's works I like Family Guy, American Dad, and The Cleveland Show. This movie was not as funny as I had anticipated. It was a good laugh but I believe the hype behind it is not justified. I would classify this as a comedy with romance undertones."
4,NOT FOR KIDS!!!!,LOTS OF BAD WORDS AND HORRIBLE BEHAVIOR . DECENT MOVIE FOR ADULTS BUT DON'T LET THE TEDDY BEAR FOOL YOU!!
3,Not a Bad Flick,"Seth McFarland is a funny writer so the movie had a lot of good, smart one liners. Not Mark Wahlberg's best acting. For a story line with a talking bear it was a decent movie."
1,mystified by the positive reviews,"I rented this movie after reading the first 5 or 6 reviews thinking it would be hilarious. I laughed maybe 4 times toward the beginning and then... it became an un-funny, predictable waste of 1.75 hours."
2,well,"this movie had a few ups, but most of it felt like downgraded family guy that would of never been put into an episode. the plot starts one way. he spends time with his bear smoking pot. to another plot get rid of him. then to another plot an evil fat kid that grew up to be a strict parent with a fat evil kid that want to steal the bear... sums it up"
2,Just Ok,"The premise was a bit odd, and there were a few brief moments that made us laugh, but overall I would not recommend this movie."
2,A funny concept that falls short,"The problem with Ted is it tries to have a balance of gratuitous with typical Hollywood formulaic moral resolutions, when it should have just stayed on the side of raunchy and giving its target audience what it wants, family guy with no censorship, instead we got a boring typical Hollywood cookie cutter piece of crap with a few sprinkles of the dirty gratuitous pure fun we were hoping for."
2,Such potential but delivers few laughs.,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. I fell victim to the ""the best parts are in the trailer"" bait and switch trick. Solid acting and very well done CGI convinced me that I was actually watching a stuffed animal that came to life. Weak story is to blame here in my opinion. I'd definitely recommend renting before buying on this one."
2,Not on my Tivo,"This item was intended to be viewed on my Tivo. After purchasing online and setting it to download to my Tivo, it has still not downloaded."
2,"Unoriginal, if you watch Family Guy","The brand of humor is way too predictable if you are already a fan of Seth MacFarlane. So, this movie is best suited for people who like crude slapstick and have never seen Family Guy.Otherwise, as some other people have mentioned, they use up 2/3-3/4 of the jokes in the trailers."
2,Not what I would expect from Seth Macfarlane,"From the writer and creator of Family Guy, I was expecting a few more laughs and punches at celebs but whatever you saw in the trailer...that was the movie..not much else there"
2,Not funny,Very vulgar and not that funny. No surprise coming from the creator of Family Guy. Definitely not worth the $4.
2,Not very funny,I just didn't think it was all that funny...it had it's moments but it wasn't all that special. Family Guy is a 1/2 hour show for reason...that kind of comedy can't sustain a 2 hour movie
2,Not nearly as good as Seth's TV work,"As a fan of Seth Macfarlane's work for years, I watched this movie having high expectations for it, perhaps too high. The movie was a comedic disappointment. You can have all the laughs you are going to get out of this movie from the official trailers, and you can skip the rest."
2,Not as funny as the previews,"I am a big fan of Seth McFarland and Family Guy, so I was expecting non-stop hilarity. Unfortunately, this movie was like a 2 1/2 hour episode of Two and a half men--all bong scenes and fart jokes.A waste of my $5."
2,Not as good as I hoped,"We had heard good things about this movie and we were excited to watch it, however we were quite disappointed with it. It was not as funny as we had hoped!!"
2,"Sparingly funny, lack of taste abound","I had a hard time stomaching the movie after the VT shooting joke. Alas, i thought the movie was only slightly funny at intervals."
1,A bad family guy episode,It was like watching a bad family guy episode. Even at $1.99 it cost too much. Don't waste your money
1,ted,i bought this movie for 9.98 they should have paid me 9.98 to watch it !!!!not for family my advice keep your money and spend it on something else
1,Ted,"It was disgusting! My husband and I are too embarassed to even tell anyone we saw the movie. The language was filthy. Can't they make a funny movie without the filthy language! I don't mind a couple of ""f"" bombs, but this was horrible!"
1,TED is Dead Don't waste your money!,Neither funny nor cleaver. Its plain stupid and bad. Waste of time and waste of money. I just shows the limits of Macfarlene
1,Dog!,Mark Wahlberg is going to have to live this one down. Jack Ass 1 and 2 were better and they were really bad movies.
4,Good movie,Funny amusing and interesting I liked the movie ally actually the talking bear is funny and Seth McFarlane is great
3,Not for kids but a fun movie,"An interesting turn on ""be careful what you wish for."" There isn't a lot of depth in the actual relationship between the guy and his bear but the off-color humor is enjoyable."
4,"Enjoyable, but not as funny as I expected.","I enjoyed this movie, but it wasn't as funny as I was expecting. A good big-screen vehicle for Seth McFarland."
1,dumb & dumber or just plain stupid?,"Watched this loser because the 2 leads are two of my favorite actors. However, should have seen it coming with the teddy bear as the ""vehicle"" for delivering this ridiculous piece of fluff. Can't believe I watched it to the end. Worst movie ever seen.Sesame Street is better than this. Way better."
2,Two Stars,"Seth MacFarlane should stick to making cartoons. There were some amusing lines, but it just didn't feel right. My wife would have given it one star."
1,A Waste of Time,It would be extremely charitable to say this movie was 'mildly amusing'. It was a major waste of time. I kept waiting for it to get better but it got worse. I like Seth Macfarlane's work and I am a big Family Guy fan. But this was bad and not funny.
2,Language,I would recommond it people who are not appalled by bad language. It was funny but a little on the foolish side.
1,Worst movie I have ever seen,This movie was not in the least bit funny. I cannot believe Seth McFarlane will be presenting the Oscars. I guess that will be as tedious as this movie was. Fell asleep after 10 mins.
1,not good,i like the idea of fantasy. this was just silly immature humor. rhey could have wrote better dialogue for rhis movie then what they had.
1,My boyfriend like the movie.. i could care less for the movie,Cheap jokes and very boring for me. I guess you have to be a fan of Family Guy to enjoy this movie.
1,I love Teddy Ruxpin but....,"I just don't get it. When you do please reply. I love all things comedy, but didnt get this film."
1,How do i get my money back?,Unrated....Unfunny. You have to have more than 3 funny parts to make a movie. I expected alot more gross funny from a guy that does gross tv. He must have given in to the Career advisors.
4,awesome,The movie was funny as hell it is a must watch highly recomended why does the earth rotate on a
3,"Funny at times, but overall a miss.","A decently funny movie at times, but for those who are not really into drug/alcohol and crude sexual humor, you'll find it lacking. The ""disney"" ending could have been written better, and Wahlberg's nemesis (Joel McHale) could have easily been written out of the script as he had no depth and didn't cause all that much grief for the main characters. For some, they'll find an animated teddybear doing drugs with Mark Wahlberg hilarious. For the rest, save your money."
4,"Hysterical, potty humor.","If you like Family Guy, you will love this movie.A lot of cheap jokes which are still very funny.Great concept, well executed."
3,Funny Comedy,Lots of guy humor. as a grandmother if was funny but 30 something guys in the family found it belly laughiing funny.
5,LOVE,I got this for my husband for Christmas and he loved it so much so I decided to buy this one as a gift for our friend. So funny!
2,Easy humor.,Very disappointing. They went with easy humor. Might be funny for teenagers but not for adults. I thought the movie was boring.
2,Ted,This movie had way too much foul language in it. The plot was ok but I didn't enjoy it due to the language.
3,entertaining but overdone,"My boyfriend liked this movie better than I did. I've seen it twice. The first time was funny but the plot tries to get too dramatic for a talking teddy bear movie. Its ok and a good movie to watch as a couple, but I wouldn't buy it."
4,Ted,It was funny but not as funny as most people made it out to be. To me it was mainly a love story with some humor thrown in. Iwas expecting better.
1,Horrible!,"Not funny at all! A failed attempt at a funny movie, all funny parts seen on previews!!! Do not waste your time"
1,"Awful, complete waste of time","To call this movie ""awful"" would be a compliment. I like Seth McFarland, although even some of his jokes on ""Family Guy"" can go a little too far for my taste. McFarland did the voice of Ted, but it sounded like Peter (dad in Family Guy), so that was distracting throughout the whole movie. But it was the crude jokes and language that went way too far for me. I especially didn't appreciate the gay bashing or the ""retard"" reference. I kept thinking it would get better, but that never happened. Nothing made me laugh or even crack a smile. It's a shame I watched this movie because it has really turned me off on McFarland now."
1,Horrible,A ridiculous movie. A waste of time and money. I quit watching halfway through. I've seen a lot of great and smart comedies. This wasn't one of them.
1,Dumb,I think I laughed twice. Not even sure why I watched the whole thing. I guess if you like movies that involve lots of drugs and getting promotions for public indecency then this is your movie but I just wasn't impressed at all.
1,Terribly slow and boring,"I LOVE Seth MacFarlane and Family Guy type humor, and was excited to see Ted, but I could barely stay awake. Most of the funny parts were already shown in previews, and it seemed more like a romance with him trying to make it work with his girl than a comedy. I had a few small laughs, but had to drag through a lot of boredom to get to them."
1,Very Disappointing,Was very surprised how shallow this movie was. Expected so much more from the story and cast. Too bad for Walhberg and Kunis. Embarrassing. Yuck.
2,Disappointed!,I like Mark Wahlberg but was disappointed in this movie. I felt they could have made it more family friendly. The language was crude and not appreciated at all by me. I guess this may be more of a 'guy' movie.
2,Meh.,I thought this movie would be funnier. It had a few funny jokes with a lot of filler in between.
2,No as good as I thought it would be,"Many people told me how great this movie was. I thought there were only about 3 or 4 funny parts, the rest was pretty slow. Maybe its one of those movies you have to watch more than once to see the funny parts?"
2,"Kind of same o, same o with a foul talking Teddy bear in it.","Too much cussing, sex with a foul talking teddy bear? seriously? i thought it was in bad taste andboring storyline."
2,This is a children's movie gone wrong.,"There's some pretty raw stuff here, some funny and some not. If 5% of the jokes were toned down, it would be an enjoyable children's movie. As it stands, it's not suitable for children, and it's too predictable (and sophmoric) for adults."
2,"Love Family Guy, hate this movie",Seriously Seth? I didn't expect much from this movie but wow! It's just awful. Making a teddy bear smoke a bong and drop an f-bomb every other word is not worth more than one laugh. I give this movie two stars. One for Mila and one for Patrick Stewart. The rest of the movie is an insult to anyone with an IQ over 60.
3,"Good, but ...............","Parts are funny, but after awhile the language gets old. Flash Gordon seems to steal the moive, and he's on drugs. Could be better!"
1,Horrible,"Horrible, I rented this on a recommendation and now I will never get back that hour and 47 minutes. Complete waste of my time."
1,Misleading,The funny parts in the trailer were spliced together and the best part of the movie. Don't waste your money.
1,I've just realized Seth MacFarlane isn't funny,"I was expecting low brow humor. I got the low brow, just not the humor. I love a good blue comedy. This is not it."
1,I'd walk out,I'm so glad I didn't go to the theater to see this movie but am a bit miffed I wasted $1.99 on the rental. The only thing that would make it worth that is if Wahlberg took off his shirt but it was so bad I couldn't take any longer.You need to be under 25 years old and completely stoned to find this movie remotely amusing.
1,Horrible!,"Terrible language, glorified illegal activities, just plain dumb! Not worth your precious time. Nothing more than juvenile humor. Save your $1.99."
1,Ted,Ted The movie would not download and what did download was unwatchable. I am disappointed this was my forst try and probably last.
1,Bad Delivery Funny Movie,"I had to give up on Amazon streaming and use Comcast to see the whole movie which is very funny, Too bad Amazon streaming is so unreliable."
1,Trash,Wish I could get my money back.Trash mouth Language dumb plot.Miss leading advertisement.Would never recommend it to anyone.
1,Perhaps the most overrated movie of all time,"This movie is nothing more than a 2 hr ""Family Guy"" episode, and it's not Season 2 ""Family Guy"", it's Season 45 ""Family Guy"" (yes, I realize the show is only in its 11th season). The jokes are hackneyed and unfunny. Everything has a been-there-done-that feel to it. Seth MacFarlane doesn't even try to make a new voice for the titular character, it's just Peter Griffin as a bear.Mark Wahlberg strikes little new ground beyond his other recent forays into comedy such as ""The Other Guys"". He's proven he's a decent comedic actor (he still rocks way more in dramas), but this clearly wasn't his best choice for another move in that direction.I could go on, but honestly, I don't get why this movie did so well and got such great reviews. It's an okay rental, but it's just not worth owning."
1,"Poor content, not funny","Prieviews can be deceiving sometimes....this is the case here....such adolescent humor, teens will love it maybe. Too bad, hoped for more....love Wahlberg, not his finest hour(s)...."
2,who doesnt luv a potty mouthed teddy bear??,"the best and prolly only good part was the fight between ted and wahlberg. nice! but i hav to agree with another commenter, it pretty much was family guy recycled gags, although i luved that potty mouth bear! a bear after my own heart!"
2,Disapointment,"I was so excited to see this movie because of the funny commercial, but when I saw it I was so disappointed. It had a lot of really lame jokes like Mark's character farting in a restaurant. This was just a lame movie."
1,ted,The streaming keep freezing... Netflix streams well....support was frustrating.Support wanted me turn off and on ruko after stating that I was able stream Netflix..
1,Almost unwatchable,"I like Seth MacFarland, but this movie was super hard to watch. Super lame and cheesy. Definitely would not recommend."
1,Terrible,"Very disappointed with this. I have almost always enjoyed a film with mark wahlberg, however this movie was filthy and just plain stupid."
1,Annoying,"Yep, that's right. I rented the ""unrated version"" and found it to be very annoying. I didn't think it was very funny at all. There were a few moments when I smiled, but overall I found it to be juvenile and as I've stated before, annoying. I'm no prude by any means, but overall this movie just wasn't that funny. Don't waste your money."
1,Family guy the movie....,Boring could have just watched family guy for 2 hours and had the same experience. Dull acting all around and nothing particularly of interest story wise.
4,Gross but funny,"A slight tilt on the classic bromance. Typical tension with the girlfriend. Coarse but funny jokes. Surprisingly, at the end you really cared about the characters."
5,Ted,The movie was so cute and humorous but beware of Ted's language and behavior as he matures throughoutthe movie.
3,"Worth paying for, but not top dollar",It was funny at times but not hillarious. The story line was pretty good. Overall decent movie but dont spend 20.00 on it
5,I enjoy it,"I have seen the movie plenty of times, lend it to family members and co-workers. Funny and charming and a bit nutty...come on it is family guy at his best."
2,Funny at times,"A few humorous moments, but a pretty lame movie concept overall. Would not rent again or recommend to anyone I know."
2,Not for young audiences..,"I only ordered this movie because I had a amazon gift card and wanted to see how movies look on my Kindle.This movie was a big dissapointment .Very crude in some parts.I would not let my Children watch this.The special effects were great ,too bad story line was awful.I would recommend buying this movie like I did.Rent it.."
2,"Silly farce with boring profanity from a ""dirty old man"" teddy bear.","Seriously not worth the time. I kept hoping it would improve, but it just decended further and further into ""potty talk"" for grown-ups. Who needs it? I finally turned it off and found something more intelligent to do with my time."
3,It was just okay.,"I was expecting to be rolling on the floor laughing based on reviews, but this really was just okay. I guess I shouldn't have expected more out of a comedy about a talking teddy bear."
2,Dumb,Dumb movie.Thumbs downStupid concept and nonsense.cant believe Mark came out on this Mila was the only good part
2,had higher hopes for this movie..,"potty humor...if this is what you want, you will love this movie(and if you like the family guy). I love family guy, but didnt find myself laughing much at all. mostly one liners for the bear...seems to target very immature adults and 13 year old boys.."
3,Don't expect much from this story line.,Some funny bits are interspersed with a contrived plot line that meanders about in an uneven performance by Mark Whalberg.
3,just OK,"wasn't really moved by the movie, the promo was the best part. I was expecting a lil more from Seth."
1,One word- raunchy,"Absolutely not expecting the crude vulgarity and content, totally misrepresented and beyond poor choice. Should have warning label and not be made to look like typical animated movie."
1,Wanted to like it,"Heard this movie was terrible but I love Family Guy, Mila Kunis is hot, Joel McHale is hilarious, so I ignored that and watched it anyway.I kept waiting for it to get good. It didn't. I chuckled a little bit at one scene. The rest didn't even get a smile. Just flat out terrible."
1,not as good,This movie is not worth all the hype. There were a few funny parts but past that its just not really worth spending any money to see.
1,waste of time,I can't even call the attempt at humor juvenile because I'd worry about a juvenile relative who thought this was a good movie. If Charlie Sheen is your moral compass - go for it.
1,Not worth your time,Boring & not a good movie. We got really sick of swearing. Not much entertainment. Very disappointed. Not worth the purchase.
1,Terrible,"This may be one of the most disgusting movies I have ever tried to watch. Could only finish about 20 minutes of it. If you like the F word, you will love this."
2,Way to Crass,I could not finish watching it. The language was a low blow. That Teddy Bear need a class in manners.
2,Not Great thats for sure,Too much bad language that was offensive to some who were watching it with me. I would not recommend it to anyone myself. I was curious about it and that is why I purchased or rented it. Won't watch it again.
3,humor was okay,"I was excited to see this, but the jokes were not very funny. I like the opening part, but the story was just silly and repetitive."
2,I guess I should have expected it.,"When I first saw the reviews for Ted, I think I groaned audibly. After it was released, it got so many positive reviews, I thought I should check it out. It tries so hard to be funny, but comes across as crass and dumb. I wanted to laugh, I really did. . . .but it just doesn't work for me. I was really bummed because I like mark Wahlberg. I wasn't all that familiar with Seth Macfarlane's other stuff. Now I am, and will probably steer clear."
4,Funny and charming,Despite the over abundance of one line inserts - it was fairly well acted - even the bear.....and very heartfelt. The age old story of a man growing up....
3,ted review,"This was kind of raunchy, but that is the point I think. I think it would confusing for parents, who are looking for something to watch with the kids becausel it is definitely not kid friendly. Don't know if this can be compared to anything, because it seems new to me. There were funny parts though."
4,Funny as Hell!,"I love family guy, and if you're into that type of humor then you'll love this. more of a guys flick, but i still loved it."
1,Hated it,"I am obviously missing something because both myself, and my twenty-four year old daughter, stopped watching it. It was awful."
2,Just not that funny,"I guess this was ""ok,"" but really it was not that funny, and it kind of wore on. If you aren't expecting much its worth a watch I suppose."
1,What is beyond jbeyond juvenile...crass?,"I don't mind movies that most people would be offended at. I don't mind juvenile thinking, pranks, and jokes. This goes so far beyond that, there are no adjectives to describe it. There were a few funny laugh-out-loud parts, but for the most part, it wasn't funny. Don't waste your time buying or renting this movie. It's not worth your time."
1,movie TED,Did not care for this movie not my type of movie did not find it funny as many people stated it was.
2,Not as funny and the hype,Not sure I understood the whole story but it didn't make much sense to us. It was ok but not something I would watch again
1,Needs to be rated,I had seen some of the previews and should have watched the trailer. This movie should be rated as I think people have the right to know up front that it is pretty rank. I would never allow any child of any age to watch it. I shut it off within a minute of the credits and should have shut it off sooner.
2,Ted The Terrible Stuffed Bear,"To vauglar, bad language in every senterce. He is puffing marij. all the time. Just a boring movie I'll never watch again."
2,so-so,"previews were the best. 16 more words required, 16 more words required, 16 more words required, 16 more words required"
2,Lame humor.,"It's nothing Seth McFarlane hasn't done before, and it gets really old about half way through. It's. rude, crude, and has no redeeming qualities."
2,ok movie,"Ted was an ok movie, but not worth 5 buck rental. Wait for redbox or netflix and watch it for free"
3,"It had some funny parts, but it wasn't ROFL type funny","Typical Seth McFarland, some parts were funny. It was a great change for Mark Wahlberg as I usually only see him in adventure films."
1,Terrible Movie,"Just watch the trailer, all of the funny parts are in it. I knew this movie would be stupid but it was awful!"
2,you have to be kidding me,"Don't waste your time watching or buying this movie. Um, a teddy bear taking a bubble bath?! and SPOILER: I totally called it on the bear going back to being a stuffed bear when he came apart on the softball field. And the thing at work with the girl- are you kidding me?! This movie was lame!! Go watch something more worthwhile and inspirational! I hope you all are smarter than me to go invest your time doing something more worthwhile!"
3,Raunchy,"a bit too raunchy at times, but fun one time watch. Would recommend kids to not be in audible range also"
3,Hummm....,I thought it would be funnier. Seemed a little too dramatic for a comedy. I still love Marky Mark though!
5,Awesome!,"If you Like raunchy humor (combination of Family Guy and Southpark), this movie is a must see!The only problem is this version is the R rated not the Unrated."
4,"strange, crude but really funny!","A friend recommended this movie and said I would either love it or hate it. As it was on sale for $1.99 I decided what the hey and watched it. It is basicly a rude, crude not politically correct romantic comedy. I enjoyed it, but this is NOT family fare, if you are a prude or easily offended by ""cuss"" words this is not your movie. If you want a good laugh and are prepared to suspend your sensitivity for a few hours you may well enjoy it."
1,This movie was terrible!,"I expected it to be crude...actually I was hoping that it would blow my mind with how crude and funny it was. Well, it was crude but not funny at all."
1,Godawful,"This movie is a true testament to the power Mark Wahlberg must wield in Hollywood. It's hard to imagine a less funny, more poorly written script. The acting is wooden. The premise and direction are just hacky, and calling it predictable would be to intellectualize it beyond its merit (maybe you have to be from Boston to be dumb enough to think this is funny). I like goofy profane humor -- Anchorman and its progeny are hysterical. This is not goofy, profane funny. It's a marketing vehicle for harvesting cash from fools. If I could think of a more descriptive way of expressing my dislike for this POS I would post it here."
1,Absolutely Horrible!,"I was hoping this would be funny, even a little bit funny. A lousy film- no redeemable qualities other than it does end at some point."
1,It's just stupid,"Very long, less funny, episode of family guy. Boring. Predictable. Ted sounds just like Peter griffin. I fell asleep. Had potential, didn't meet the hype"
1,Horrible and not funny,"The movie isn't funny at all. I really wanted to laugh but couldn't come close, except maybe at it's stupidity and juvenile attempts at humor. Don't waste your money."
5,Whoever says this isn't that funny needs therapy!,"In a time where all we have is movies with supernatural, vampires, and gladiators, a good comedy is what we need. This is it!! I couldn't tell you how hard I laughed throughout this entire movie... How many of us did we want our favorite toys come to life when we were kids?? I bet at lease 99.9% of us! This movie is a gut buster... I hope there's a sequel!"
3,Not as funny as I hoped,"This movie had it's funny moments, after a while it was just plain tired. I'd hoped that it would turn the corner and become funny again, but no such luck."
3,Meh...,"The movie was not as funny as I thought it would be. Many of my friends enjoyed it, but it didn't do much for me. There were just a few parts that made me laugh."
3,Tries to be too much like Family Guy,"I really like Seth MacFarlane and generally love his sense of humor (Family Guy & American Dad are favorites). I also like Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis. Unfortunately, Ted missed the mark in lots of different ways. The thing that struck me the most was the similarity to the animated shows that Seth MacFarlane is famous for developing. There are certain things (situations/jokes) that work very well in cartoons, but they just don't come across the same way when using human beings. I really wanted to like this movie, but it just didn't do anything for me."
3,Crudely Funny,"This is a funny movie if I were in my 20's-30's, member of a Frat House. or just loved stupid humor....I will admit, there were parts that were funny... Not a film I'll watch over & over..."
2,Cute but not that funny...,I am not too sure what the hype was all about with this movie. It started off quite funny but it went down south afterwards. I am glad I rented it instead of wasiting my $$ in the theaters.
3,Cute and Funny,"I enjoyed the movie although I thought it would be funnier than it was, from other people's quotes. I don't regret renting it. I just didn't expect to see any serious parts."
3,Not Quite Enough for the Big Screen,"Some funny moments, but uneven and overall, unsubstantial. Might have been better suited to episodic TV. Wahlberg & Kunis sell it well."
3,Kinda funny,Great movie if your a stoned 15 yr old. Pretty funny if your a 30 year old who is not stoned like me...
4,Loved it,"Ted was a riot, Mark played a great roll and the writing for both him and the bear where great, so authentic, reminded me of when I was in my 30's with my buddies."
3,Some good lines....,"..but that couldn't make up for the areas where it drug. Its almost like they tried to create a lot of character development and plot in a slapstick, which just didn't work. Its a talking stuffed bear, no need to be serious.Not bad as a rental and sitting with a few friends on a friday night, but some of the fun will come more of watching your friends reactions to a few scenes and not necessarily the movie itself."
2,Meh...,"This movie reminded me of a not so funny, super long version of a family guy episode. I had a couple of chuckles throughout the movie, but it seemed to drag on and overall wasn't really that funny :("
3,"Funny movie, but expected too much I guess","There are some very funny lines, but I guess I was expecting more. Overall, still a good movie and worth it"
3,Pretty Good,It was about as good as I expected. Pretty funny if you like Seth McFarland (which if you don't then don't rent this movie). Some slow parts but the majority of it is funny.
3,Funny at times but mostly... just ok.,I rented this movie after being told it was hilarious. I just didn't find it very funny. I love Family Guy so my hopes were high... maybe too high. I was disappointed.
2,Not what it's cracked up to be,There was about 15 minutes of good comedy that made you laugh... The rest of it was stupid! Not what I thought it would be.
2,Not what I expected...,"I after watching the trailer and all the previews I thought this was going to be a great movie. Unfortunately, the raunchy language went a bit to far and was so repetitive & predictable I became bored & fell asleep."
1,Stupid,I was hoping this was funny. I have a great sense of humor. The laughs were few and far between. i actually feel less intelligent for watching it. I'm glad I only spent 3.99 to rent it rather than going to the theaters.
1,It have a lot ot bad words,"I didn't see the whole movie, someone recomended to my husband, but I didn't like it due to the bad words; also I didn't see nothing fun."
3,funny parts,"it was okay, a little vulgar. There were some pretty funny parts.These are extra words to get to the minimum"
1,Crass!,"Garbage. It wasn't cute, interesting or unique in any way shape or form. Maybe pre-teens's or the totaly immature ""adult"" may find it entertaining. Deffinately not for me! Sorry, but that's how I feel. We streamed it in HD, but the Video quality was very poor."
2,TED,"I was disappointed in this film. I thought it would be funny, but the joke got old fast.It would have been fine as a skit on SNL. Be warned, this is not a kids movie."
4,Very funny.,"Raunchy, but it is Seth Mcfarland. That is what you get. I laughed all the way through. A little corny toward the middle, but still very good."
5,Great Quality Via HD Streaming,"I rented the HD streaming version of the movie. I watched it on my Roku XS and the quality could not be beat. Also, the movie is pretty hilarious. If you're a fan of Seth McFarlane's work, then you'll love this."
3,Oh well!,"Sometimes when you see previews the movie looks great. However, you get and watch the movie, the previews, or trailerare the best parts of the movie. That's my opinion on this flick."
5,Great price for this special rental,It took more than 6hrs. to download in HD with Tivo and an internet speed of 12mbs. Much slower than Netflix.
1,Why is it so popular to use the Lord's name in vain?,"It never ceases to amaze me how the Name of Jesus, the Christ, makes it into the scripts of films and presumed to be funny. If they knocked a Muslim or Islam like that, they'd be hunted down and killed, yet (somehow) it's 'okay' to trash the Christian faith and God. I'm sure this review will go over like a lead-balloon, and if so, that's due to the depravity of the readers' spirit who align themselves with such antisemitism (Jew-hating) and anti-Christ values.Darkness cannot stand the Light, and will strike out against the Light. However, Light wins every time.Sure, the premise of the movie is funny, I mean it's a walking, talking teddy-bear after all. But when you lace a movie with such gutter values (many of which I didn't even address), giving it a 1-star is a few too many.Mark, give me a call. We seriously need to talk."
2,Definitely Seth McFarlane,"It was two hours of the same tired stuff from Family Guy... random comments trying to disguise themselves as jokes, immature humor, and complete predictability."
2,Not very funny,Interesting concept but fell short. Too much off color humor which then distracted from the story - not sure there was a plot.
1,I was sorry I paid real money to watch it.,"Save your hard earned money. Marc is always nice to see, that's all. I can't understand why actors feel its necessary to do these kinds of things, don't they watch the rushes? Make the decision then, UCK!"
3,"Cute, but wait til you can see it for free","Cute, but not a side-splitter. Knew it was going to be an adult-only movie, but the vulgarity was a bit much. Made this sailor blush. Wait til it comes out for free on Prime, so when you're finished watching you won't give yourself a ""Gibb's Slap"" (NCIS reference) in the head for buying it."
1,awful,"This was an awful movie and worst purchase. Someone said it was a great movie, and they obviously didn't watch it."
5,A must have for any move collection,Even if you are not from Boston this will be enjoyed. It is a mix of pothead humor with a great story line. This can be enjoyed by all ages... my dad at 60 loves this movie!
3,Good comedy,"A bit disappointing but only because my expectations were so high. That said, I did enjoy the movie. Some laugh out loud moments, but overall I'd say it was about as funny as an average Family Guy episode."
2,not tha good,movie was nice but not to be viewed on the big screen. ending is a little bit lame. but the ted is cute though
2,Stupid,"Ugg! Waste of two hours of my life! Couple funny parts, but that was it. Glad i didn't buy it, just rented it!"
4,Very funny film,I had heard mixed reviews on this one. We liked it. Kept us in stitches for most of the movie.
3,Okay,"If I wan't to listen to the ""F"" word for atleast 100 times I would of just taken a drive to the worst section of town. Some funny parts."
1,Awful,I was asked by a friend to watch this movie. What a waste of money. This has to be one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. My wife and I shut it off half way through. I don't recommend this at all.
2,Ted,"very different story, but the jokes got tired very fast. I soon lost interest and watched it from the back forward."
4,Not just what you see in the commercials...,"Hilarious, but do not bring your kids! I would not have expected anything less more Seth Macfarlane. May have to watch it again."
2,Not so funny!,"Maybe part of the disappointment was due to the fact that a couple of people had Tim me it was the funniest movie they had ever seen. I love Mark but it just wasn't that funny, I had a couple of moments but I don't get it!!"
3,"Predictable, but watchable and often funny","Although easy to predict the course of events, Ted was still a pretty funny movie. The most interesting twist comes early in the movie when we realize that Ted is not a figment of John's imagination. John's wish for Ted to be alive actually comes true and Ted's newfound ""life"" becomes a media sensation for a short time. Overall, if you keep your expectations properly adjusted and remember that you are watching a movie about a talking Teddy Bear, you can sit back, relax, have a few laughs and not have to think too much. :)"
4,Ted goes hard,This movie goes hard and is all out funny if you like this kind of humor. I think Seth made this movie for the kid in all of us.
3,Funny,"Maybe not the best comedy I've ever watched, but funny for a long layover on my Christmas day trip :)"
2,"cute, but a little too expected","You pretty much know what's going to happen in the first 5 minutes, Giovanni's dance scene is creepy in the best way"
5,Ted,Very funny movie. This talking Teddy Bear is a hoot. Makes you want a teddy bear that could talk. I recommend this movie to any on who has a good sense of humor.
1,Terrible,"Terrible movie, do not waste your time and money on this! Terrible movie, do not waste your time and money on this!"
4,"Good for western people, bad for Asians","i watched this movie in Korea.It has so many fun moments.But the thing is the Korean audiences didn't know what to do when the funny parts came out.They just didn't know how to respond!Am I supposed to laugh at that part or is this kinda dirty joke? They were confused!For instence, when the Teddy is playing with the lotion at the supermarket to look like he is jurking off, people in the theater were all very very quiet. Is this a joke or dirty sexual stuff?I know what to do but tried not to laugh out loud.I bought it in DVD just to study more.Did I liked it? It was ok. It reminds me of A.I(Spielberg's) movie that Teddy also appears.I am a filmmaker and need to learn more about my people-Korean (Asian)The picuture and sound are all good.Think no need to buy it in a bluray because it's not a masterpiece or anything."
3,Just okay,"Just okay, had its moments, fluffy storyline, comedy sporadic. I need 11 more words this review is stupid. La la"
3,Just Mediocre,"Don't waste your time purchasing this one. Very few funny parts. The main actor was good but I wouldn't care to see it again....ever,"
5,OHH YEA !!,Very Funny and laugh out loud . It is such a unique story idea I was surprised it turned out so well.
3,Ted,Funny movie but a little out there. Pretty raunchy in parts. Mark Wahlberg and Mila were great together. Definitely not for children.
2,Teddy Ruxpin on CRACK,"I really did not like this movie at all. It is highly vulgar but not really funny. It has it's moments, but it is like watching classic Eddie Murphy, Andrew Dice Clay, Martin, and Richard Pryor stand up, all rolled up into one, without a punchline. DEFINITELY do not watch with kids, even more mature ones. You will be embarrassed in 2 minutes."
2,"Wow, this movie is just not good.",This movie had so much hype and I bought into it. It is not a funny movie. I guess I had way to high of expectations going into it.
3,brain-dead fun for grown-ups (only). NOT for kids....,"just fun. gratuitous swearing, farting, pot-smoking, and overall parody on growing up in the 80's. silly, but works for a saturday morning grown-up cartoon. the plot/antics/dialog is juvenile however the acting is good."
4,Funny!,"This movie is mindless, raunch fun! Definitely not one for the whole family. But, if you're looking for something to pass the time, this is hilarious!"
3,TED review,The movie has a few touching and funny moments. Overall I wouldn't recommend it to anyone over 30 unless they still think like teenagers. No disrespect to teens but some of this stuff could only appeal to a bunch of guys or girls downing beers and drugs.What a waste of Mila Kunis.
2,GOOD STORYLINE POTENTIAL,The story had great potential to become a really funny movie. But it seemed raunchy language and juvenile gestures dominated the dialogue and actions.
4,LOL!!!!,"not for the kids, that's for sure.....it was fun, entertaining but wow, very profane, again, just for adults who don't easily offend."
1,horrible...,"We couldn't even finish the movie! It was stupid, not funny and a waste of my money and time, period!"
2,Love story sucked the humor out,"Beginning was ok, middle was funny, end was depressing. Reminded me of ""The Apartment."" Watching a breakup is painful, even if a talking/stoned teddy bear is involved."
3,Meh,"As a huge Seth MacFarlane fan, I was disappointed. The movie was funny and I enjoyed it, but I had expected it to be much funnier."
1,Another attack against Asians,"This man obviously has something against Asians. Look at all the work he has done, he can't thrive without taking a shot at an Asian person."
1,Sucked.,"Sucked. Did not like at all. Really did not like. Want my money back, that's how bad it was. Sucked."
1,The worst film I have ever seen,Went to see Ted at the movies last night. I was really looking forward to seeing it.The trailers were great. So how could they get it so wrong. It kept repeating itself. The comedy was just stupid. If I had been by myself I would of walked out. When the movie finished my friend said she did not like that.Come on Hollywood you can do better than that.
1,Offensive and not funny.,"As a parent of a child that had cancer, I really don't think the cancer comments in this movie are funny or necessary. ""TED' says ""no peeking, or you will get childhood cancer isn't even funny. Writers could have picked something that people don't actually die from, like no peeking or you'll get a boil on your butt. Also another cancer reference in the movie too. I guess it's funny, until it happens to you or someone you know. And yeah, I take it too seriously."
1,"If this is what comedy is now, then America has officially become dumber.","I've never written a review before on Amazon, and I only wanted to write this so I could warn the people who haven't seen this movie. This is a complete waste of time and money.Seriously, when did cocaine become funny and cool? It's not even that, the lines were just not funny at all. If you have low IQ or do drugs, you'll probably find this movie hilarious. How sad. Some of those 5 star reviewers are probably one of those paid people to leave great reviews on products. People wake-up! This is not even remotely funny. The only part that I found funny was when Mark and Ted were punching each other, that's it.People wake up!"
1,Ted,Sad evening. Many families with young children were there to see the movie. Deceptive poster implies that this could be a children's movie. It is trash that only gets worse as it unfolds. The Teddy Bear acts out the most vulgar behavior.
5,Finally!! an adult content childrens story.,"Put the kids to bed before watching the unrated version. I put this one up there with ""Blazing Saddles"", ""Team America"" and ""Dr. Strangelove"". Mark my my words, it will be a comedy cult classic. I didn't realize Mark Wahlberg was so versatile. All I knew about him was he had a troubled youth, he was now a devout Catholic and family man that made movies about athletes making the long shot. He really came out of his mold for this one."
1,not for everyone,Lots of pot smoking and the f word a lot. Certainly not for kids of any age. Had some odd sexual things too.
2,dumb movie,some funny lines...but not worth the money. It just seemed to drag on & on & on. Not for kids ears.
4,Funny stuff,"Somewhat unique, yet very much what you'd expect, I'm hardly a movie critic, but I enjoyed it. The wife though the language was a bit much at times (and it was). Still laughed plenty hard at points"
3,Surprisingly Raunchy,"While this movie was entertaining, it was more raunchy than I expected. Just make sure to watch it with someone with a sense of humor keeping that in mind."
3,"Good laugh, senseless movie, gets the job done.",If you want to laugh at something dumb... this is the movie for you. Nothing serious about a teddy bear who comes to life and makes his owners life troublesome.
2,terrible,What a waste of 2 hours. The only funny scenes were the previews. Bad choice for Mark Walberg. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone..
3,Not as funny as I was expecting,My expectations were high going into the viewing (perhaps unreasonably so) and I ended up finishing the movie underwhelmed. The movie was entertaining enough but not quite the gut laugh fest I was expecting.
2,Wow- could have been so good.,"Stupid, and no imagination on situations that could have happened with this. Walberg is not likable - basically HANGOVER WITH A TEDDY BEAR"
2,I was expecting better from Mark Wahlberg,Should have talked to my friend before viewing - it wasn't that great. There were funny parts but overall a flop.
3,Ted (unrated),TED (unrated)Really believe the characters could be funnier without being vulgar. The evolution of kid to man was missing.
3,Great for Guys,"Unfortunately I am a girl. Generally stupid and crude humor, but I did laugh a few times. It was worth $4 to rent for a group of people to watch. Not a fun date night movie."
4,Surprisingly funny,"I wasn't too sure about a movie about a teddy bear, but Ted was a fun movie to watch. At times it was a bit crude, but overall the movie was genuinely funny, sweet and was a refreshing change from other movies which all seem to have the same story line."
3,Funny,Cool to see Mark Wahlberg in something other than an action film. This movie has some really funny parts that include the teddy bear.
3,not that funny,have seen better movies the trailers were more funny than the actual movie was I do like Mark Walberg though
3,Funny but lame,Was a cute movie. Some great laughs but overall not a good movie. Surely not worth the money to buy.
