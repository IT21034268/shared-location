1,I'd rather be waterboarded...,"Absolutely horrible! Mr. Henderson should spend more time learning to write than reviewing his own books.On his website, Mr. Henderson describes himself as the ""Optimistic Realist"". Here is a ""Realistic"" review of this book: ""Mr. Henderson is literary troglodyte. Based on book sales, it is going to be a cold Christmas for the Henderson family."" --Waterboarding Weekly"
5,Beautiful story,"This is a beautifully written story, complete with it's own song and music, about a little otter who strays from his mother, and how she calls him home with song. A soothing, delightful bedtime story."
4,Justice League Heroes,"While it's no Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, Justice League Heroes does offer up the chance to play as the best that the DCU has to offer. The graphics are good as is the rock-em sock-em simplistic approach to gameplay. The only real downside is the lack of characters to choose from and the lack of a whole lot of wardrobe changes. All in all, though, a good game for anybody who likes Action/Adventure games."
4,Works ok,"When I first put it in the psp it wouldn't load but after taking it out, wiping it, it did start playing."
4,I am satisfied with the purchase,"It is OK, it came on time and my child liked too much. He told me that it is too funny and I recommended it for that reason."
1,Very Disappointed,"I'm a HUGE DC Comics fan, much more so than I am of Marvel Comics, and I really didn't like this game. In comparison to Marvel: Ultimate Alliance and X-Men Legends 2, it's not even close. The gameplay was boring, I didn't like the leveling system, The graphics were shoddy, and I didn't like how I could only use certain characters at any given point. I tried using a character cheat code so I could access all the characters, but the game kept freezing. After about a week, I gave up and sold the game. Waste. Of. Time."
4,Great starter camera!,"We got this camera shortly after our son was born, in early 2005. It is still taking great photos. Yes, the lag time btwn shots is terrible, but the ease of use and picture quality make up for it. Since it's old as of this writing, you might see it at a yard sale or something. If you find it for a good price, it's worth buying."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this camera for my 16 yr old daughter for Christmas. I wanted a basic camera for her first digital. Unless you are only a few feet away from the subject, the pictures come out very blurry.My older son and I both have the Olympus Camedia D545 camera. I was so impressed with that camera, I thought one step down would be the way to go.The Olympus seems to be a great brand, and has a great software program with it.I'm not at all pleased with the D-425, and am going to try to exchange it."
2,"No Viewfinder, Beware","If you are used to looking through a viewfinder and composing a shot, beware of this camera, it has none! You must look at the LCD to frame your photo and outdoors in bright light its just about impossible to see what your picture will be. There is no optical zoom so zooms are very grainy. And forget about the photo software that comes with the camera because it is not nearly as good as many that are free on the web. I really regret buying this camera."
2,very poor indoors,"i love the camera for outside shots, however when indoors (flash on, flash off, red eye or auto flash)you cannot focus at all. the function that ""freezes"" the shot before taking it is virtually non existent when indoors. i have had tremendous difficulty in taking decent pictures inside, even after numerous takes."
2,Not a camera for a serious photographer,"I was on vacation about a year ago and slammed my digital camera in the car door. I was in the middle of Utah and my options were limited, so I bought the D425 as a quick replacement. I have to say that the photos I took with it were spectacular, mostly of landscapes and geological formations in bright sunlight. Since then I have been very disappointed with the performance of the camera. The shutter delay is horrible and I usually end up with pictures of my friends with distorted faces because they ask ""whats taking so long"" when the camera finally records the image. There are no bells and whistles on this camera and the overall performance is okay for a rookie but could sometimes be frustrating. My wife was so frustrated I had to buy another camera for her to use."
4,"Tula Hat, Sierra -- stylish & well made.","Much more substantial than generic hat made of straw . . . the palm fibers are darker and heavier. Comfortable inner band and very soft leather straps that feel good against the skin. This model rides fairly high on head, does not touch ears, which is good if wearing with wrap-around style sun glasses. Only flaw were some slight imperfections in the stitching of the palm -- hardly noticeable."
1,Underdocumented To Death,"This is a slim compilation of short summaries of the bizarre manners in which people have been killed over the years. It's a fun read, but it's sullied by the lazy manner in which the information is presented - short on historical detail or documentation to support the facts. The authors make no excuses and admit upfront that some of the items listed may be less than factual, which is something I can't forgive in a book like this. If only they'd taken the time to actually check out the stories, so that I knew that was I was reading was true, it would be so much more meaningful. Alas..."
4,"Hilarious, and Disturbing","I found it sad and funny, even if some of the stories may have been factual... The authors weren't going for thurough, so don't expect a crime novel in this book. But still very amusing!"
2,not worth it,"I bought this set of films because of Blind Man, have been looking for a widescreen copy of this film for a long time. I liked it when it first came out in theaters and found it quite enjoyable. My complaint is the running time is only 1hr 23 min, yet according to other sources the running time is 1hr 45 min, so that means 20 to 25 mins are missing. Also if I remember right Ringo sang the title song and that was missing, so I'm really disappointed in what I purchased. As for the other films ""And God Said To Cain"" The slip cover says widescreen. it is not it is in pan and scan, just like three of the other films. picture quality on all six films is very poor, it looks like they where taken from a vhs tape. All have a lot of artifacting and are almost next to impossible to watch. I am disappointed in these films and feel that pop flix could have done a better job on them."
1,Waste of Money,"I purchased this product for my laundry room and installed it yesterday.I found the installation to be a little awkward because the holes for mounting the valve against the wall are on the ells right behind the valve body containing the lever.Frankly, I'm worried about leaks in the future because the only thing holding the water back is an O-ring that is compressed between the ell and the body of the valve by a screw. What's worse is this section of the valve can pivot - putting wear and stress on the O-ring seal.The quality of the casting doesn't seem to be that great either because there were signs of patina/corrosion in the hose fitting threads; and where the O-ring sits, the ell casting looks crooked where it was machined to mate with the body of the valve.Bottom line, I'm probably going to replace it with a pair of good quality ball valves and no longer worry about leaks. A waste of money..."
3,Nice books but not worth the money,"Nice books, I have the set, however for the money you can have a lot of nice fish and you get more information on the net than these books describe. Nice pictures and a ok reference book. If you got to get one buy the 5th, which recaps the first 4 books. Hope this helps"
1,Low volume,"The volume is so low on this phone you can hardly hear the person on the other end, even with the volume turned to maximum. Returning this phone today."
1,Horrible voice feedback,"These phones, look impressive, and are inexpensive, but your speaking voice feeds back into the ear so loudly that it hurts. yet, if you turn the volume down you can't hear the other end of the line."
2,Not worth the price after all,"We bought this set about a year and a half back, and for the most part, we were very happy with its performance. Sound quality was reasonable (personally did not feel the speaker-phone volume was very low). However, over the last few months, the calls seem to drop frequently, the amount of static has increased, and the displays on both units are toast. I was forced to buy a new set (Panasonic this time) finally. Less than two year life is probably not worth the price, I would rather pay more and have a set that lasts longer. (We keep the batteries well charged, so it is not a battery issue)."
2,"Speakerphone, what a JOKE!","I bought this phone really for it's speakerphone capability, or lack thereof I have come to realize, and will be returning it as soon as I get another one to replace it. The reception for the handset is also sub par. I'm quite shock because GE is known for making pretty reliable phones."
5,Excellent Early Childhood resource!,"Bobbi Fisher has done it again! This is a must for all early childhood teachers. A very readable, practical book about using shared reading as a strategy in your early childhood classroom, along with the added pleasure of having Bobbi's daughter talk about her experiences as a first year teacher. A must!"
4,Awesome Old school rap,"I had this CD way back in the early 90's. It pounded like a 4 ton sledgehammer. Trendsetter and South Dallas Drop along with MMM There it is were my favorites. I still catch myself sayin, MMM, there it is. I am gonna get another copy of this CD at some point."
1,Full of Bugs and S__L__O____W,"I've been working with computer doing design work for 12 years. Web for 7. I've used everything, Photoshop, Illustrator, Freehand, Flash, PageMaker, Quark, InDesign (love it), Director, GoLive (not bad). But Studio MX 2004 is so loaded with bugs and so slow that I've reverted back to an old version of GoLive. It's sad. Click to open a small file... and wait. CSS... oh, it decided to erase them and replace them witih crap. SO much for my styles. What you see is NOT what you get. AND tech support - awful. Their web site is the most awkward thing to navigate and find information on. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PIECE OF TIME-CONSUMING SOFTWARE. It will spin your wheels and give you headaches."
5,Movie Themes,"I love all of the ""Hooked on Classics"" series, so I ordered this ""Hooked on Movies"" CD. It is a great CD for anyone who likes movie themes. It is divided in several categories, so there is a variety of music. I enjoy the upbeat presentation synonymous with ""Hooked On"" CD's."
1,Silly,"The cd you receive is the wrong cd, it's a movie theme cd. I wanted OH That's Nice not a movie music cd!!"
1,Vladimir Kim,"I bought this book as I was interested in simulating in simprocess. The book is not useful at all neither for an experienced modeller, nor for a beginner. This is of no use for a practical modeller, theoreist or student.It is more of an entertainment kind of book with very generalistic sporadic examples about where simulation application was successful and funny pictures, double space 16 font text with no content.For beginners, one should rather buy ""Business Process Simulation"" by Laguna, which also has a student version of soft. One can go through simulation examples and learn a lot. (I bought this two books together)In general, if you want to waist your time and money, and read something in half an hour and learn nothing, buy it. But but does it make sense to pay for nothing and make the authors rich just because they are from GACI or Ernst and Young consultancy. Bad use of their brand to promote the sales of the bad book (but probably not so bad software)"
1,unwatchable mess,"this ""film"" trys hard and is very innovative and unique but in the end just comes off as more of a demonstration piece then a substantive film. i like the concept, but am disapointed with the performance."
2,Not So Great,"I ordered this for my new phone. Some of the strings started coming out of it. I just clipped them off. The case is a little large for my taste. Pretty much because I like to put the phone in my back pocket, and the case it a bit large to do that with. Overall, it does protect the phone well and it is a great fit for the phone! The buttons are easy to press through the protective plastic."
3,An admirable Shot-On-Video release.,"Slaughter Tales isn't going to be a film for everyone, especially those who have little to no knowledge of the SOV horror titles it takes inspiration from. But, the film is a perfect example at how dedication and enthusiasm can overcome limitations caused by a shoestring budget. I can honestly say that with the state that horror is in these days, Johnny Dickie's horror opus offers more originality and a true admiration for the genre that is lacking in the horror films released by major studios these days."
5,Get out your reading list . . .,"The author defines ""cult"" novels as those that speak ""not only to the reader but for him"" -- not a bad description. As a college student in the early 1960s, I was swept up (along with everyone else) by the cult authors of the day, especially Burgess, Tolkien, Heinlein, Kesey, Brautigan, and Vonnegut. (I managed to avoid Castenada and Hesse, I'm relieved to say. . . .) All of them are included among the fifty authors profiled and analyzed in this essay collection, though the author apparently whittled his original list down considerably. While I don't agree with all of his observations -- I think Hunter Thompson has long been vastly overrated, for instance -- he's so often right on the money, I found myself jotting down those titles I hadn't read in decades, plus a few I had missed entirely. For an avid reader who is always looking for other people's thoughtful suggestions of what to read, this is a first-rate volume."
3,Fantasy That Is A Little Over The Top,"In Tiger Prince, Caren Blakemore takes a needed vacation to Jamaica, where she meets Derek Allen. As they spend the week together in the romantic atmosphere they soon become lovers. The beginning of the book is more like a fantasy and fairy tale as Caren and Derek become ""soul mates"" within hours of meeting. Once back from their vacation the book starts to pick up and become more realistic. Caren finds that Derek has a secret he failed to tell her and she finds herself in a terrible situation. Tiger Prince is slow starting and once you get past the vacation in Jamaica it picks up the pace and becomes a pretty decent romance novel."
4,"Light, but very very pleasant","This is truly a book to travel with. Not heavy and can be put down and picked up again without losing your place. The Tiger and his lady made very interesting reading. Going on a trip, have some time to kill on the plan, in the car or on a train? Like romance? Do your self a favor and pick this one up."
5,Awesome! Very Romantic,This was the first Sandra Brown book that I read and I could not put it down. It is VERY romantic and sensual...you will be swept away.
3,NEVER WOULD HAPPEN!,"THIS IS YOUR TYPICAL LOVE STORY OF PRINCE MEETING AVERAGE GIRL, AVERAGE GIRL FALLS IN LOVE, THEN THINKS SHE NOT GOOD ENOUGH AND TRIES TO RUN AWAY, THEN FINDS OUT PRINCE LOVE THE GIRL AND THEY LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER. IT WAS A NICE LOVE STORY AND IS A GOOD READ FOR A RAINING DAY."
2,This Tiger is a Kitten in Disguise!,"TIGER PRINCE is a story about Caren Blakemore who goes on vacation to Jamaica to stop thinking about her trying job and a recent divorce. There she meets Derek Allen who is also avoiding the real world. They have what they determine is a fantasy affair, and think they will each go their own ways at the end of the vacation. Then Derek's secrets draw Caren into an international problem with little room to avoid a public scandal.TIGER PRINCE is a decent story, but very unsurprising. Characters are not as strongly developed as in Sandra Brown's later books. She originally wrote this one under the pseudonym of Erin St. Claire, and I've found that the books written under that name are not as dynamic and strongly defined as those written under the name of Sandra Brown. It's a fair way of spending a few hours but I wouldn't drop everything to read it!"
4,An easy read....but a little cheezy,"As stated above.....Cheezzy. Nevertheless, it was an easy read (read it in two days), and enjoyed it, even if it was a little over the top. The only thing that really annoyed me was the heroine insistently running away because she thought he was so much better than her......"
4,Challenging One's Faith,"Easier to read than other books by Willard, this one lays out a clear path for Spiritual Transformation. The challenge for the reader is to walk the path- which will probably require several readings and study of the scripture references."
5,Great ska,"I only came across this group by accident, but this album quickly became one of my favorite ska albums. The Siren Six distinguish themselves with a clean, tight sound. I also like the organ, which is unique (as third-wave ska goes) and used to good effect. It's really too bad that the group no longer exists."
5,this is rock n roll,this is what ska pop should sound like. listening to this gave me goose bumps i loved. its not as good as gherkin. the whole cd is rock n roll ska. i think that every ska band could take lesson from these guys.
3,DO NOT rely on the trailhead directions,"I purchased this book a few days ago and have already done two hikes in the Olympics. While the trail descriptions themselves are generally okay (mileage markers are suspect) and it provides area and trail starting points for a Washington newbee like me, the directions to the trail head for both hikes was completely wrong. If you purchase this book, buy a forest map as well, or stop at a ranger station for correct directions to the trail head. Wrong turn directions (right instead of left - that sent me 40 minutes out of the way) and, road name errors. I ran into someone on the trail who had the book who said the same thing happened to them."
3,Not laid out well,"This book has many great hikes,, but I do not like the layout. It is not nearly as easy to read as other hiking guides such as the Falcon Guides, ,or my favorite, the Sullivan guides for my area. I find I don't use this one much."
2,best hikes with dogs Western Washington,I disagree with the first two reviews. If you want a book to give you dog friendly hikes this is a start but the trail information on the hikes I tried was not very accurate. I even got stopped on one hike where the trail had been washed out several years prior to the publishing of this book. Use another source to actually make the hike or you will be disappointed.
5,great video shot in mexico,"This is an older video with some scenes from Duckmen 5 and also from Mexico hunts. I paid less than $5 delivered. The video is about 45 minutes long. Great video for my money. I really enjoy watching some of these older videos when Jase was younger and had short hair. Everybody else looks pretty much the same. I think it was shot in 2000-2001. As a side note, I have been watching Duck Dynasty religiously. It's a great show if you like the Robertson clan."
4,DelaBel Lookin for a New Breed,"Hostile 2000, the latest Delabel release in the Hostile series sees the big names in French Hip Hop putting their weight behind juvenille underground artists. The concept is original in the french scene but lacks the beats to back up the lyrical talent of the featured senior artists. There are some great discoveries on this album though, L'Skdrille shines through in his duo with Rockin'Squat. There are a lot of young talented artists here that can hold that deserve to have their own tracks. BElabel and Hostile need to go back to old format of discovering underground artists and giving then the freedom of performing their own style!"
1,Trivial and full of banals,"The book is partly obvious and mostly poorly researched. Nota bene, what really interesting and insightful about the financial side of life can someone write just two years after graduating from college? What's more, Miss Kamenetz writing style is stiff, repetitive and the final procuct boring. So, save yourself $14 and few hours of time possibly wasted on reading this opus."
4,"Its the family, stupid","This book hits the nail on the head when it comes to economic realities facing young people today. My husband and I started our lives with a combined total of 125K in student loans and faced unemployment disasters, but we are making modest progress for one reason: we got married and stayed married. It is very hard for me to sympathize with people who complain that they cannot afford to buy a house when they refuse to get married, instead preferring a playboy lifestyle. Young people need a stable partner now more than ever. It may sound old-fashioned, but believe me it works."
2,Partly true.,"The comedian Paul Lynde was once asked: What famous person said ""Truth is the glue that holds us all together."" The answer was Gerald Ford but Lynde said ""I thought we were all screwed together."" And this, I think is the point Ms. Kamenetz misses.We have put ourselves on a path towards a declining quality of life. That's a given. And employers will never do what's right unless they are forced to. Of course some people will do well and call the rest of us lazy as they watch from gated communities.It may be that this has fallen disproportionally on the younger generation but corporate America is laying off employees of all ages, as fast as they can. The difference is, if you're 24 and forced to take a job at Target, you can at least get one! Try and do that when you're in your 50s. Employers will not touch you, and why should they when there are 24-year olds available?"
1,An Unfortunately Terrible Book,"The arguments set forth in this book are often poorly reasoned, the research is inadequate, the people interviewed by the author are far too similar ... but worst of all, the book is horribly unbalanced in terms of the (liberal) political bias of the author. And speaking of the author, readers will rarely have encountered such a self-absorbed promoter of ideas she clearly has not taken the time fully to understand. I don't know how many times she interjects that she went to Yale. Who cares? She suffers the delusion that affects many (young/second-rate) journalists, which is that anybody cares about the personal opinions of journalists. This is a great topic for a book, and Kamenetz accidentally blunders upon a few good points, but it is unfortunate that the subject matter is done such a disservice ... the only redeeming quality is that she quotes a few other authors who actually have something to say."
1,you must be kidding,"""boohoo, life is so hard. i cant afford opulent luxuries like getting engaged on a european vacation or stacks of china and silver given as wedding gifts...oh wait i did get all that."" give me a break."
3,Tough to get a razors edge,"The sharpening system is a good one, but it is tough to get that razors edge I was trying to achieve. I have very high quality knives and I was looking for a sharpening kit to have the same quality. It takes some getting used to however, knowing what I know now I would have spent a little more and purchased a higher quality system."
3,Better in person.,"Having seen Barbara Higbie in a small-venue concert a few years ago, I jumped at the opportunity to own this CD. I was a bit disappointed that the music did not evoke the same feelings. She plays with a brightness and beauty few possess. It is amplified by watching her express her art as a performer. The music on the CD seemed unexceptional, though not unpleasant. I'm glad I own it, but it doesn't get heavy rotation in my playlist the way Eva Cassidy does."
5,Canon BCI-6,The product appears to be as advertised - original genuine Canon Ink. Experience has taught that my Canon S9000 Photo printer preforms admirably on Canon ink and not so good on generic ink. Product arrived in a timely fashion but poorly packaged although undamaged.
4,Really happy with product and the prompt shipping,I needed Canon inks for my 13x19 printer and these tanks render great color reproduction in all cases. I wish they had a high capasity cartridge so they would last a little longer.
5,sausalitoron,"I have a Canon S820 printer. I tried the non-Canon replacement cartridges from several dealers on this site. None of them produced a decent picture, despite their promises. I certainly do not like paying these high prices for the Canon cartridges, but they consistantly produce great pictures and other documents."
4,IT WORKS and gives good color,What can I say it is ink -- but it does the job. NOw if we could just get the price down on these ink jet inks - that would make it perfect.
4,8-pack is good when I need 'em all,"Canon Inks are excellent. I make a lot of gallery quality prints and the Canon Inks are splendid in my good Canon printer. When I need the entire range of inks this is the most cost effective for me.However, the packaging is a nightmare to get through. I have mixed feelings every time a supply of inks arrives as I know it will be a long time before I slice/slash through the plastic wraps to get at the product I need.Especially for a store like Amazon, it should be easy enough for Canon to dispense with the extra 'pilfer proof' plastic."
5,Most economical way to buy Canon inks,"I haven't found a cheaper way to buy Canon ink carts for my i9900 printer. I just won't use 3rd party inks for my prints, some of which I use to create cards which I sell. I have printed hundreds of prints with the i9900/BCI-6 and have NEVER had any plugging or printer problems due to inks. I just hope that this package deal will continue for those of us committed to this particular printer/cartridge technology."
5,Canon BCI-6c Cyan Ink Tank,"Great Canon quality ink tank. Good value, but if you need other ink colors the best deal is AMAZON's combo paper and ink pack which includes cyan, magenta, yellow, 3e black, and 50 sheets of thinner glossly paper (a very good deal). Highly recommend this product or any other Canon ink products !!"
5,Canon BCI-6BK Black Ink Tank,"I find the best prices for Canon cartridges on Amazon.I have used compatible ink cartridges and Canon cartridges, the compatible brands don't come close to Canon brand.I saved money on the off brands but the print head clogged,I have never had this problem with Canon cartridges."
4,Black Ink Tank - Canon,This item is available in many places. I bought it from Amazon because the price was good.
3,"wasteful ink, Canon $$$","Well this is canon own ink so the quaility is top notch and I have great photo printouts. My beef with this ink type is that it dry too quickly and canon printers waste too much ink when you turn it on and off, it does it cleaning or something. I don't use myCanon i960 Photo Printerthat often, when I do use it for black and white, I get low ink all the time. Sometime I only use black printout and the other color inks are out. I spent too much money here on Canon fast dry-up wasting ink compare toOriginal HP 56 Black Ink Cartridge in Retail Packagingand and old Epson that I could refill the ink/color. There is no chip on the ink, but I got a newCanon PIXMA MP560 Wireless Inkjet All-In-One Photo Printer (3747B002)that does use an ink with chip like HP.So you get good quality but Canon makes their money off the ink that dryout too fast when not used. Canon makes the best printers for the price/ features/quality so I am stuck with their ink again."
5,thank you amazon,"spotted this genuine canon yellow ink cartridge on sale, just before the holiday's;price was lowest I ever found. I needed it and ordered it; free shipping, no sales tax and it arrived in a couple of days, in perfect condition. Thanks, amazon."
5,amazon is the only place to order.the price was right.the merchandice was factory. with a canon printer you bettte use the canon,I HAVE TWO CANON PRINTERS. I TRYED THE $2.00 INK AND THE $5.OO INK AND WHAT A MESS. I HAD RAINBOW COLORS.NOT GOOD FOR THE PICTURES. YOU HAVE TO USE CANON INK OR DO NOT PRINT THE PICTURES.ED LINDSEY
1,Generic Ink Tank Substituted!!,"The seller opened the Canon package and substituted a generic Photo Magenta ink tank for the Canon brand tank. The tank was already leaking through the packaging, and, against my better judgment, I put it in my printer--very poor quality. DO NOT buy from this seller!"
5,Just as Presented,"I am very wary about buying ink cartridges online. On Amazon, even if you filter for new only and manufacturer only, it brings up used cartridges from unknown manufacturers.Used cartridges are really not good for your printer and you never know exactly what you'll get (unless you have your own cartridges refilled). Now if you still want to use them, that's up to you.My issue is that you really have to pay attention to make sure you are getting new and sealed manufacturer cartridges when you are buying online. (Wish Amazon would do something about that but I suppose they are busy.)So my review for this product? IT WAS A FACTORY SEALED NEW CARTRIDGE just like it said it was. Good place to buy from."
5,"Genuine Canon Brand Ink, how can you go wrong!",Why risk damaging your expensive printer using cheap generic's?I only buy Genuine Canon Brand Ink for my printer. Yes it costs a lot more then the generic but I don't want to have to replace my print head repeatedly because of it.
4,Buy the original Canon ink...,"Buy the original Canon ink if you are using it for your photos. The generic brands will fade in a few years.Of all the Canon ink, only one came damaged (my loss). But most is good quality but I wish they pack more ink in a package. It still runs out fast.Buy 2 at once from Amazon and save with free shipping."
4,Canon BCI-6 6-pack,Item received as ordered and indeed looks like orig. mfr. item and unopened.Haven't installed any cartridges in printer yet but expect them to work fine.
1,Unbelieveable,The Product is great! I just never got what I ordered. After 3 tries I finally gave up.
4,excellent product,"I have never had any problems with this ink cartridge. Never clogs like the lexmark. Easy to replace, also."
5,"Original Manufacturer's ink, just as advertised!","I am very pleased with the price and quality of the Canon inks I've purchased here. Same brand as the retailers, but about $5-$7 cheaper! After trying several generic inks from other online discounters, I've learned that they fade quickly. Now I only buy the Canon inks, but they're expensive at your local retailers. Amazon saved me $$$!"
3,"Buy this genuine product, but watch shipping costs","I concur with others who warn of using off-brand inks and toners. They can even damage your printer. On the other hand, I purchased this 8 months ago and since then the shipping cost has ballooned 800%. There is no reason to pay $7.50 to ship this item. The price here may seem great but factor in the shipping cost in your decision."
4,Canon has a 8 pack set which is great for the special printer,"The large size printer needs special ink. Canon's 13 x 19 printer requires the 8 color process. One of the things I found was on Amazon.com was some alternative supply of ink for one of their vendors. The quality of their ink compared favorably and we bought about a 3 year supply.The Ink from Canon is very high quality, but is pricey and especially compared to the competitor."
1,Inky Rip-off,"I bought this ink tank set thinking it had all the tanks for my printer (iP4000), Two of the tanks were duplicates, no large black tank (3eBK). Worse the magenta tank won't dispense ink. So much for saving money on ink. Just hope the other tanks work, probably can't return it to Amazon or Canon."
1,cheated,"This was not the product advertised, it was not canon ink, it was something else that I would not even put in my machine. I am veryy dissapointed in Amazon alowing this to be sold under their name"
2,Canon i960 does not use a red cartridge,"If this company does not check which printers actually use the cartridge, why should I trust that they really know their products work at all?"
1,"Ordered Canon Ink, Got Amazon Ink instead","I purchase lots of items from Amazon, but NEVER ink again!I ordered canon ink for my canon printer, but was sent""amazon inks"" tanks instead.I used them, but soon several nozzles became clogged, andI had to replace the printhead.I now buy ink directly from canon, or from a retailer whereI can see what I am getting. I regret that one star is thelowest i can rank this item...if i could, it would be morelike negative 5"
1,"It's INK, took over two weeks to arrive","OK, it's ink, Cannon Ink, common ink. Took over two weeks to arrive and the cost of shipping makes it not such a good deal. So we purchase online becasue it's easy, right? I just bought my next ink at Best Buy, even though I hate Best Buy. Why, beacause two weeks is too long to wait for ink! I also hate the Amazon policy where stuff comes from different suppliers, thus you pay multiple shipping. That makes Amazon less attractive to me. If I want to buy from Staples I'll shop at Staples. And the policy of hiding the price till you go to the checkout on some items? How foolish is that?"
5,be careful of which magenta you buy,"This, like all Canon products I've come across is superb. Be careful though, to get the correct Magenta ink for your printer. I mistakenly bought the BCI-6PM (photo magenta) instead of this ink because I wanted to use it to print photos with my Canon MP780. I ended up with every color print coming out with a greenish orange pall. I spent hours trying to figure what was wrong (Photoshop color space, ICC profile, Printer drivers etc.). Simply substituting the magenta cartridge for the photo magenta cartridge instantly solved my problem."
5,Great quality - better than fake.,I am using this cartridge with my Canon Pixma IP3000 at home. I have printed about 200 mid-sized pictures since I installed it in my printer. The cartridge has lasted four months. I finally received a message that the cartridge is empty but still am able to print from it. I have used cheap cartridges in the past with another Canon printer and came to a conclusion that what you pay is what you get. The cartridges lasted very little and clogged up the printer heads. I think that paying more for the authentic Canon is going to pay off in the long run - your printer will work much longer.
3,Recyclable Package?,"The paper part of the packaging says ""Recyclable Package"", however there is no recyclable symbol on the plastic clamshell part of the packaging. What say you Canon?Is it recyclable or not?"
4,Canon BCI-6BK Black Ink Tank,This is a standard Canon product at a discounted price compared to local computer stores.Ron
1,Deceptive product photos,"These are not in Canon boxes as shown in the photos. They come wrapped in bubble wrap inside a white box that contains a note stating ""that they were purchased from Canon's asset recovery program without retail box."". That is not what the product photo shows or what the product description states. The note also states that they are brand new, guaranteed fresh and is a genuine Canon product. That may very well be the case but as far as I'm concerned this is a blatant case of misrepresenting what is being sold."
3,didn't get what I ordered,"I ordered the product pictured but the actual delivered was different. First, I thought I was getting a Canon product but I did not. Second, I ordered a multipack of 6 and got individual packs of 8 different colors. I mean, I have no problem with the bonus 2 but the point is, I did not receive what I ordered in the first place. For this, I'm disappointed."
5,Works Just As Advertised...,"With gas prices these days, might as well buy them online. I ordered 3 of them with Amazon and got them within 2 days - pretty good. If you buy 3 or more, you get the free shipping which also saves money."
5,Excellent customer service,Very impressed with the shipping and the ink seems to work just fine thus far. I will buy from this company again!! Thanks.
5,canon printer cartridge,"I ordered this after viewing online, but didn't realize there is an extra color cartridge I cannot use. I don't understand why it was there but will use other cartridges."
5,Best deal at Amazon,Great product as always. Works perfectly with my seven-year-old S9000. The only problem is that most retail stores like Office Depot sell them for $75+. So I'm happy to see that Amazon has them for only $54...
3,"Good product, but slooow shipping.","Overall, the product was great, but the free shipping wasn't. I took nearly 3 weeks to receive the item--also there was very little tracking info on the USPS.gov shipment status or it reported the same status (being at the same location, for over a week without movement). Usually I receive my items quickly from Amazon.com, hopefully, this was just a one time occurence. Otherwise, I enjoy the product."
1,This is not a quality ink!,My pictures have been terrible ever since I inserted this cartridge! I have to print 2-3 prints before one comes out half way decent. I will never purchase these online again.
3,Drowning in ink,"I have had my Canon S9000 Printer for over 8 years with few problems except one...the ink tanks run on empty way too often. I suppose it is all political...sell a product that needs another product to survive. As ink tanks go the colors are all true blue, or pink for that matter."
3,"Good color, runs out fast","I love my Cannon i9900 printer, but it's amazing how quickly the ink runs out. These ink tanks don't seem empty when the printer says they are unusable, but continuing to use them supposedly damages the printer. It's frustrating to throw away a used tank when it still looks 1/4 full."
5,Canon BCI-6 ink cartridge,You can't beat OEM ink cartridges in my opinion. More dependable than refilled cartridges and better quality printing in my experience.
4,No substitute for Canon printers,"I own a Canon Pixma, I6000D. I've been a photographer for over 15 years. My first printed pictures (on Photo Paper Pro) from my digital camera were better then most prints that I had made with actual color paper.I've used other printer inks, and other papers. Canon's color is amazing, accurate, and the best."
1,Total disappointment,"We bought this set of printer ink in November 2011. When we tried printing the colours looked horrible! We did everything to rule out printer fault because we could not believe that this set of ink could ever be knock-offs, at the price we paid. This set should include photo colours so can you imagine turquoise blue water printed as brown! There are no green or blue hues; all our pictures have a reddish brown hue. Will not be caught again. BUYER BEWARE!!"
4,8 is enough,"The only problem is that the 8 cartidges do not exhaust at a uniformn rate. This is touted as a positive feature but these rather expoensive cartidges are an expense which hurts too much. I would print many more pictures if the cost of the ink and the paper were lower.I am not assured that this is the best ink and paper, only that it is a Canon product!"
4,cannon inks,"Recieved manufacture's inks. It was a multipack, no individual box, but all in good condition."
5,canon ink,Canon ink for my Canon i9900 printer I bought here in Amazon for the cheapest price on the internet
5,Do not use generic inks,"I have found that if I use the original Canon inks in my printer, not only am I assured of a superior quality picture, but I don't have to clean the ink heads (which uses extra ink) a tenth of the amount of times as I did with the others. Amazon is the cheapest place that I have found to purchase these original ink tanks."
4,Good value,This ink cartridge was well priced and arrived in good condition while printed right away after it was installed into the printer. What more could one ask from it?
4,Standard Canon Ink Tank,"For my canon printers, I have always relied on the genuine canon made product. I don't like the ink tanks running low so fast even if the printer is just sitting without daily use, but the colors have always been dependable."
5,printer ink,Have always ordered this product for my printer and have always received superb customer service and quality product.
5,Couldn't ask for a better deal!,"I usually purchase this set at least once or twice a year. It is such a good deal. You are getting genuine Canon ink. With my previous printer, I had bought cartridges with the ""compatible"" ink....and ruined the printer. Now I stick to the genuine stuff. These cartridges are anywhere from $10.99 to $12.99 in my local community, so to get these for less than $10 per cartridge is quite the deal.There are colors which are used up much faster than others, such as the PC and PM and black. I end up going down to a local store and shelling out the bigger bucks.Wish they would also sell multi packs of the individual colors at these prices!"
4,Results,"I have never tried anything except this product. The results are far superior to any other brand, that I have seen. Friends and neighbors, have a variety of different brand name, photo printers, and my prints are consistantly more vibrant. I even won a ribbon at the County Fair, using my canon i9900 printer with canon inks, competing against mostly photo's, printed by proffessional printers."
4,Great deal at a great price,"Would buy this product, whenever I need ink for my printer. Hope it will always be available."
5,Umm...it's ink?,"As you'd expect from Canon branded ink cartridges, they work exactly as advertised - no more, no less. Buying the complete set is the most cost efficient way to purchase ink for my printer, and asides from the black cartridge they tend to wear out at roughly the same rate. Bottom line is that if you have a Canon printer that uses the complete gamut of BCI-6 colors, this is the best bang for your buck."
5,I'm sticking with OEM,"I'm sticking with replacement ink from the manufacturer of the printer.I've read enough reviews to be warned about going ""cheap"" and the consequences it could bring.This is the real deal as far as I can tell and works as it should."
4,It works!,"What more can be said, the ink works in my printer! It is too expensive and does not last long enough but until I get a new printer I'll continue to order this combination package."
5,Completely Satisfied,I have switched back form Generic ink and my photos arfe much more vivid now. My printer works like new again. The cartridge came quickly and without any problem.
5,printer ink,"Item arrived quickly and in good shape. Printer ink is too d----- expensive. Your price is best I have found. (always looking)The ink is top quality. after a couple bad experiences I buy only Canon. I know someone else can make good ink for a fair price, but they have to offer me a free trial or forget it. I can't waste money and time trying all that is out there.Amazon has never disappointed me. I'll be back."
5,who knew!,"i was so pleased to be able to purchase the ink i needed online. i had no idea amazon sold it. it saved me a half hour bus trip each way to a store. as i am handicapped,that was a real blessing ."
5,Original Canon ink,"Prints great. Great value from Amazon. I prefer to buy Canon ink to ensure best quality and no damage to my Canon printer. I have purchased ink refills since 2005. Originally I bought the ink from an office store, but when I found that I could buy it from Amazon for 1/2 the price, I became a loyal Amazon customer."
2,Not Canon OEM product,"4 Aug 2012. From the seller in response to my question.""Dear valued customer,Please note that the items you ordered are generic, non OEM, compatible ink cartridges, not genuine Canon ink cartridges.This can be very confusing since the picture is the same as the original ink cartridge.We understand your concern and we apologize for the confusion.Our ink cartridges are made from the highest quality materials and contain the original chip from the OEM ink cartridge to ensure genuine ink results, the only different is the price.""The seller replied quickly and honestly and I was able to cancel my open order, so I have rated 2 not 1.I don't know the quality of this ink but it is not in a Canon cartridge. I have not yet found an off-brand ink for high quality photograph printing with my Canon i9900 photo printer, so I dare not try this ink. Considering the savings, you may choose to try it."
2,Shipping is a killer,I wanted to order 7 of these refills. Shipping for this is $30.00. Apparently they will not consolidate the order and charge for each individual cartridge. I am leaving for the local Office Max store.
1,Great Product- can't get it,Over a month since I ordered Canon ink tanks and I keep getting weekly delay messages- A the while Amazon advertises that by paying extra you can get the item in a day! A day? I haven't gotten my order in a month! Get Real!
1,good stuff-way too expensive,I am a new user of an i9900 Canon Printer. The color is exceptional and I love the easy interface.The ink cartridges are easy to snap in and the computer tells when one runs dry.My biggest kick is the price. What is that ink made from?I paid $400 for the printer and now have to pay $$$$ for the ink?
2,Poor order that got worse!,I needed three of the cartridges and would someday need the rest so I decided to buy efficiently. The deal was free shipping with any order over $50. Little did I know that the order did not qualify for shipping on the one touch order or whatever it is called. It turns out this wasn't free shipping. The order which was a marginal savings to begin with became a real loser for me. Amazon said sorry and threw in $5 to offset part of the shipping. The actual shipper who I contacted couldn't stop the order because they had already filled it and although it hadn't shipped they couldn't stop it. I sent it all back. In the future I will really read the fine print on all of Amazon's disclaimers.
3,INCCREDIBLE!,"About a month prior to this order I searched internet, including Amazon, for ink tanks for my Canon printer (including this item) but made my purchase from CARROT INK. On date of this order I ordered 10 copies of a book, and behold, there was this item added that I had in no way ordered at that time!!! But, the book order was perfect, and I could eventually use this ink tank, so I just let the matter drop until you asked for this review. Allan Anderson."
5,WOW!! Different and exciting!,"Yet another hit among exited readers, that enjoy reading about the Dragons and dragonboys of the Maneri fighting 109. Even though this book only really talks about Bazil and Relkin as they slowly make their way through the lands of terror and encounter things that may even be feircer than Bazil Broketail in full battle armor with a newly edged and sharpend Ector in his hands. I would reccomend this anyway since it is about the only book without much refference to the other books (history). b"
2,A change of pace,"Christopher Rowley changed the style and pace of the series with this book. Unlike the traditional dragon and boy fight together in the legions as they stave off an evil group of magicians, the plot for A Dragon at World's End is full of magical intrigues and elves who toy with the real world as they play what is to them a game. Rowley grabbed the ""me too"" line of giving his main character magic when Relkin, the dragonboy of Bazil Broketail, discovers an ancient force under his control. Really, my favorite part of the book was the preview of the next at the end. Evidently Rowley agrees, because his next book promises to go back to the basic storyline again"
3,A litte crazy,"Too much like CS Lewis... pulling stuff outta the air... my least favorite of the series. Dwarves, Elves, hidden cities, lizard people, giant monstars, its not Wolds End, is a circus with a little sickness."
5,You get a lot of watch for the price!,"I'd have to agree with everybody here. This watch was definitely a nice add to the ""collection"" and I find myself choosing to wear it at least as often as even the most expensive watches I own. I, too, truly appreciate the perpetual calendar with the leap year function.As can be expected, though, it takes a bit to figure out how to set the time/date/etc and I'll have to keep the manual somewhat handy since it's not necessarily a pull-the-crown-and-adjust-the-time affair like simpler watches.Overall, it's a beautiful watch and I'm very pleased with it!"
5,What a watch!,This watch is one of the neatest watches I've ever seen. All the functions are great and I have gotten MANY compliments on it. I love the eco-drive. Just a GREAT watch.
3,Beautiful display. Poor quality and service.,"I bought this monitor for my wife about 3 months ago. A few days ago, the DVI input started malfunctioning (I would be able to display in 640x480 resolution, but not higher; also the computer would not recongnize this as a plug&play; monitor). I isolated the problem to the monitor by swapping the DVI cables and trying with both a PC desktop and a Apple Macbook Pro - in all cases, the monitor would only work at 640x480 resolution.I called for warranty support. The support representative was pretty rude (much more so than the average these days). Bottom line is that the turnaround time for warranty repair would be 15 days, and there are no local service centers where I could bring it in for a quicker service. Since the VGA input still works (and the image quality is still decent - this is a plus!), I decided to opt out of warranty service this time around."
2,As good as other monitors priced $50 less,"I bought this on a whim, on sale at Circuit City to replace my LaCie CRT. At first I noticed that the text was a lot more fuzzier than my CRT and the color was way off. I spent about 2 hours trying different settings until they as close as I could get to acceptable. Later I noticed that the monitor was darker at the top and gets lighter as you go down, so a solid block of color appears as a gradation. About a couple months in the screen started displaying noise and artifacts as if some sort of interference was disturbing the picture.By the time I had discovered this, it was too late to return it. And the thought of dealing with the notorious customer service left me cold. I'll let this be a $260 lesson and next time search out better reviews from users like me. I wish I had used the money on a $600 monitor in the first place, I guess you do get what you pay for (or maybe less)."
5,best cutting blade,"This is the best blade I ever had for producing smooth, splinter free cuts for picture frame mouldings. I high would recommend it to anyone wishing to get a great cut."
5,Awesome Plywood Blade,"I bought this (Freud LU80R010 10-Inch 80 Tooth Hi-ATB Ultimate Plywood and Melamine Cutting Saw Blade with 5/8-Inch Arborblade for my table saw and the comparableFreud LU79R007 Perma-Shield Coated Ultimate Plywood and Melamine Saw Blade, 5/8-Inch Arbor 7-1/4-Inch by 60t Hi-ATB 38-Degreeblade for my circular saw. I used the circular saw to break down a 4x8 sheet of 1/2"" Baltic Birch into about a dozen or so over-sized pieces which I then cut to final size on the table saw. I did not have any, not one, chip or splinter with either blade! Every cut was knife-edge clean! I'm super pleased! The cost of these blades are worth every penny!"
4,A must have for SF Bay area HipHop Headz,"This lp covers the gamut of HipHop Rap flavas, from Universally Tight flows and beats, to Bay area regional stuff, it's all good and must be heard to appreciate."
2,Poor quality,"Picture quality is extremely poor, this is 2007, this manufacturer simply copied a VHS tape unto DVD.Extremely disappointed.Eros should be ashamed of themselves to sell stuff like to the public."
5,Great Book,"I bought this book on a discount rack at my local bookstore just because I thought it would be interesting and I liked that it has the nutritional breakdown of all the recipes. I use this book constantly. I absolutely love it. If you like ethnic fare and want healthy recipes, you must get this book. You won't regret it. I didn't."
2,URGH,This book was FULL of errors! You cannot do an entire section without finding errors! This book was also a lot easier compared to the real thing so I was very disappointed. I scored 93% composite on my PCAT but it had very little to do with this book. >:( WASTE OF MONEY!
1,Crap,"This book has a lot of wrong answers in the answer key, and justifies them in some way that will teach you the wrong information. I was very confused about they way they answered a couple of the organic chemistry questions. When I turned to my organic chemistry professor for help, she informed me that the right answer listed was not the right answer at all, and the same went for a couple of the questions I was unsure of. After I realized I wasn't confident in the answers they provided me for chemistry, It was hard to believe the other subjects weren't full of errors. I do not recommend this book to anyone."
2,PCAT,"The practice tests were way easier than the actual PCAT and a lot of the information was incorrect, for example the amount of time you get for each section was wrong in some cases. The quantitative analysis sections were the biggest disappointment. They were basically just algebra and geometry in the practice tests, but the actual PCAT had way more calculus including derivatives and integrals. I wish there was something better out there with lots of practice tests, but when I was looking I couldn't find anything. I just got my PCAT scores back and am applying to schools for next year. Good luck to you all!"
4,very good practice,"not as difficult as the real thing.has some areas it spends all its time on.others it doesn't touch.if repetition is your thing, get it.a lot of the same questions worded differently."
1,Don't waste your time nor money,"The answer keys are often wrong. Sometimes simply B instead of C, but several math errors where the correct answer they have listed is completely wrong. This book will underprepare you for the real PCAT. Avoid at all costs"
1,It took 2 weeks to ship thisNOT 24 HOURS,"Who knows if this book is worth the price. I ordered it on 3/22 and it shipped 2 weeks later, NOT within 24 hours. It is April 10th and I still haven't received this book."
3,Good practice,"Decent practice test questions for math, biological, & orgo & general chemistry. However, the verbal analogies/sentence completions are too easy, and the reading comprehension section depends primarily on outside knowledge and assumptions, rather than actual reading of passages. E.g., a question asked about the bioethical scientist's view on stem cell research. The direct statement from the passage states that the bioethical scientists want more stringent laws regarding the research, without explaining why they advocated legal regulations. However, the correct answer given by Cliffs is that the scientists debate whether people have the right to play God...Nowhere in the passage was God/religion ever mentioned.Also, some answers to chemistry and math questions provided wrong letter choices, even though explanations were correct. There are also typos in the questions and answers."
3,Good PCAT prep,"This book provides a comprehensive review of everything you need to know on the PCAT but cannot be used alone. For more detailed help, supplement with an MCAT prep book because the information is pretty much the same on the PCAT."
1,Do NOT purchase this book,"This book appears to have been written by a 2nd grader. SO many typos, so many contradictions--and the reading comprehension, well let's just say that just about every question has two possible answers, ambiguous and opinionated. The typos alone make this book not worth purchasing. I'm going to have to buy a different book--do NOT under any circumstance buy this book--by the way, it's not really five exams--many of the same questions show up again and again throughout."
5,Wings of Azrael---On Their Way.,"Wings of Azrael...Who's that? Only one of the best Pittsburgh area bands. Their debut album ""Suspension of Disbelief"" is one in my top three of all time. This album is amazing. These kids are on their way."
4,wings of azrael,"It's a very good EP. I noticed that ""Auburn Road"" and ""Ceramic"" really stand out from the rest of the songs. For only $7, you get tempo variation, great screaming and melody that everyone will enjoy. I can see that This Day Forward influenced the band a little but you can cross Coheed & Cambria & Atreyu in the EP description. It is very good, I suggest you to buy this."
3,title of review,"Auburn Road has a rilly nice intro, but degenerates into basically generic emo with only the keyboards in the background keeping it interesting. A Breath... is just blah. This is a band obviously trying hard to be unique, but it comes out contrived and overridden by generic conventional emo influences."
5,Great for any Halo fan,"Being a big fan of Halo myself, I got this as a Christmas present and was very amazed from the level of detail the book goes into. Although it being slightly outdated, only talking about Halo: Combat Evolved and Halo 2, This book was definately a great gift."
3,"Some Nice Concept, Too Many In Game Renders","I bought this book so that I could see the process that the concept artists went through to come to their final designs, and while there are some nice examples there are a lot of in game renders that I wish were not present. I already have played the game Bungie, I don't need to be reminded of what it looks like!"
4,A pretty good art book,"Packed with plenty of eye candy for the reader to look over and interesting writings about the development of the game. I was pleased to find a decent amount of conceptual sketches and beautiful environmental renderings.As far as the down side of the book, a good portion of the art is cut outs of in game 3D characters and weapons, which is fine in it's own right, but what really caught my eye is the amount of stretching and poor quality anti-alias 2d images all over the place. I wouldn't mind them so much if this was a general HALO book, but seeing that this is the ART of HALO Book, it leaves something to be said about the editors.That aside, i am really pleased with this book. I wish it were somewhat thicker but for it's size it really does provided plenty of good stuff to look over and read about.4 out of 5 from me."
3,Better to google for the images,"My advice is for the buyer to look over the actual book before purchasing.I had expected the book to be filled with awesome illustrations previously exclusive to Bungie employees, but most I had already found through Google. I was disappointed that they fill a good portion with space-filler character templates. The quality of some pictures printed don't match up to the quality of the same images uploaded onto the net by the company.The writers could of placed some effort in detailing how Bungie created the virtual world, considering how its part of the title... Its not as well written as other reviewers would lead you to believe. I'm not hating, the art work is GREAT. It's just not worth the money as it's currently priced (That's why I gave a rating of three).I bought this as a gift for a Halo addict, who loved it. A must have for devoted fans, but never buy it for yourself."
3,"To me, a little disappointing","I was expecting this book to primarily be for displaying conceptual drawings and paintings created during the designing process of the games. There is some of that, but the book is mostly filled with images of the 'in game' 3d models used for the characters and still shots of the 3d environments. The actual conceptual drawings take a back seat. The paintings that are there are great, but why aren't there more?! Overall, I think a 3d modeler would enjoy this book more than a 2d artist."
2,Decorative Murals,"As a professional artist/teacher, I was disappointed in this book. Currently, my high school class is working on a mural, and I needed some technical guidelines. This book is definately for the absolute beginner or hobbyist, who would like to decorate their home. If you are looking for artistic projects that are very easy, this is for you. However, if you're a serious muralist, who needs tips on proper media use, as well as transferring and enlarging, this book is a waste of time and money."
3,Only for fans of Donna Dewberry,"As a decorative artist I found this book somewhat revolting.Then again, I didn't know Donna Dewberry's work before.Well,she is great at the one stroke painting tecnique if that's what You like, You'll find some of that, but She can't draw at all.Wherever any basic drawing skills are required ,she just doesn't cut it.Her colors are in place though,and the book fills You in on the basics,here and there, but it's not detailed enough for a complete beginner, or would mislead him/her, and just useless for a pro.I keep it as a reference for clients, who like this folksy style,but I find it rather primitive."
3,Could be better....,This figure of Captain Kirk is really not too much better than those previously made by Playmates Toys [although the scale is larger]. The sculpt is only fair. Articulation is good but they could have done better. Why not give us the extra two cents worth of plastic and give the good captain a phaser and communicator as accessories. When was the last time you saw him use a tri-corder? Major flaw with ALL art asylum trek figures is lack of a peg hole in the foot. These figures do not stand on their own for long which is a BIG disappointment to collectors who display their toys.
4,A great idea book for handy people,"My husband is a handy guy with way too much energy. I saw this book and thought that it might give him some useful ideas and plans. He has really enjoyed it and looks through it every evening before he goes to bed. These are detailed projects for modern homesteaders-greenhouses, root cellars, honey spinners, chicken coops. This book probably isn't for beginners looking for cute afternoon projects!"
5,Build it Better Yourself is a handy book to have,We have gone through this book and have gotten lots of good ideas. It was a great deal for the price.
4,Good for ideas and beginners,"Great ideas for beginners, but if you already have a clue as to how things work and are built, it is rather pedestrian. This does not demean the value, but it's simply not very useful to me and I'm glad I borrowed it from the library."
5,A captivating illustrated history,"Civil War And Revolution On The Rio Grande Frontier: A Narrative And Photographic History is the story of the bloody fighting that erupted in Zapata Country only days after the shots fired at Fort Sumter initiated the American Civil War. Featuring more than 125 vintage images taken by a skilled Prussian photographer Louis de Planque and his followers, Civil War And Revolution On The Rio Grande Frontier is a captivating illustrated history that relates the deadly toll of war. It covers not only the Civil War itself, but the guerilla fighting that continued long after the official end of the war, and the murderous raids and mercenary armies that pillaged both sides of the border, as well as the ""justice"" that would sometimes amount to indiscriminate hanging. A highly recommended contribution to American history and reference shelves."
5,It works and is easy to use,"I've used this test several times over the past year and have found it to be accurate. On a couple of occasions my son initially denied using the drug that showed positive. However, in every case, he eventually voluntarily confessed. If he hadn't, I might have thought the test was faulty.I should add that my son tested positive for about 1/3 of the drugs in the test. Too bad it doesn't test for LSD, or he would have tested positive for that, too.Eventually, he started hiding bottles of good urine (urine that will pass a drug test) around the house and in his pants so that he could fool the test. A word to the wise...Today, he is on the Dean's list in physics at a major university. So, keep testing parents. Don't give up."
1,Beware of this product,"This product will not test for Synthetic Cannabis. I run a drug treatment program for teens and young adults. Recently one third of our teens tested positive for Synthetic Cannabis. This drug is very similar to pot and we are discovering that it is the ""in"" thing among teens who are getting high on this readily available drug and yet passing all the drug tests. Look it up in Wikipedia. [...]Larry FritzlanCorte Madera, CA"
2,"ummm, confused","I honestly don't know how this band made it this far with this singer. It's one thing to kind of sound like Ian Curtis. It's another to totally try and rip him off. This guy needs to chill and just sing. I mean, i like Joy Division a lot too, but not enough to stand in front of a microphone and TOTALLY try and sound like Ian Curtis. This is just completely rediculous. It's a shame too, because this is pretty good sounding record. the guitar sounds amazing, the drums are huge, the songwriting is decent... I just can't get by the vocals. If Interpol were a Joy Division cover band i would give them 5 stars. As it stands now, the only band i can give 5 stars to that sounds like Joy Division is Joy Division.Throw it down big man! THROW IT DOWN!"
3,An entertaining 80s retread,"I have to think that most of the reviewers falling all over themselves were listening to the Mickey Mouse Club & Kids Incorporated when bands like Joy Division, Echo & the Bunnymen, the Church, and the Psychedelic Furs were in their heydey. This is a pretty good album, but I have my doubts people will be talking reverentially about this album in 20 years as they do about albums like Songs to Learn & Sing or Unknown Pleasures. Let's not get carried away frothing at the mouth about Interpol. The album is fun if derivative. Other than a distinctive frontman, I don't necessarily think their lyrics are that great. Anyone remember Wang Chung? A couple of cool hits, but once you got past those two or three songs, everything else they wrote was mediocre. In defense of Interpol, they're better than Wang Chung was, but they're not worthy of 4 or 5 stars (yet)."
1,Interpuke,"This CD was recomended to me because I am a huge Radiohead fan. At first listen, each song sounded strangely familiar to tunes I had heard before in the eighties and early nineties, which made me anticipate a catchy chorus- instead I was introduced to Interpol's lead signers 'voice', which is plain unlistenable. In the recent past, I cannot remember a voice that was so difficult to enjoy. Each song left me unsatisfied and just plain dissapointed. No wonder it was at a discounted price."
4,Pretty darn good for a debut album,"I recently purchased the album and it immediatly reminded me of the strokes, but better. There really isn't much to say about Interpol other than they are an amazing band and hopefully will remain in the scene for years to come."
1,hype machine,"yeah, you heard me, ONE STAR.ok, so this band was SO hyped up, as some sort of rebirth of NYC post punk. yeah, was i excited? you bet.what did i get? a bunch of socially (and fashionably) inept hipsters ripping off everyone from the smiths (say hello to the angels) to joy division (....every single track).i hear all this business about complex song structures and melodies, ARE WE LISTENING TO THE SAME ALBUM?? i mean i guess on paper saying ""HEY WE'RE TOO COOL FOR A CHORUS IN THIS SONG, LETS JUST GO ON A BORING TANGENT AND SING LIKE THAT GUY FROM THAT BAND WHO KILLED HIMSELF"" might seem like a good idea to a bunch of people without ears or taste, but to the rest of us? come ON!i really really hate this band, and i dont understand how they get away with being a total cover band."
4,"Unoriginal, perhaps, but...","...these guys rock. Having seen their blinding set at Leeds festival I can safely say that Interpol's intensity and skill marks them out as the post-punk nostalgia band for the noughties. I love every track on here and were it not for the fact that there isn't an original moment on the album it'd get five stars. Practically everything about this band can be traced directly back to Echo & the Bunnymen and perhaps Joy Division (I'm not really hearing the similarity with JD, but plenty of others are). So one star deducted.But these NY boys imitate their Brit forebears with self-awareness and talent. Stella and NWA are particularly fantastic songs, but the album really doesn't have a duff note. And they mark themselves out by adding a distinctively New York flavour in the dark humour of the lyrics. Impressive stuff."
5,They really know how to turn it up to 11 !!!!!,"That's so freakin' funny - Thank you!!!!I think Interpol has already redefined Rock and Roll for the 21st Century. Thought it's clear there's a Division in these reviews, I'm confident that the Joy they have created will never cause their recordings to Fall from the charts. They are a Cure for the Echo of bad pop dancing in our ears from the radio's of the brain-dead masses. Their Psychedelic element, though a throw-back in time, makes me with wish I was in my Kitchen making special brownies.Those stale fools that comprise that `other' band so many people keep referring to don't hold a candle to Interpol. They're so lame they haven't even put out an album of new recordings in how many years? Talk about lack of creativity!Interpol - the New Rolling Stones! (Beatles shmeatles)"
1,SPINNING IN HIS GRAVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"IAN CURTIS WAS A ROCK GOD and nobody but his family and band members should be allowed to make money from his creations.Interpol are a talented bunch of kids with good taste in music who should have directed their talent into creating something new instead of RIPPING OFF JOY DIVISION!Hopefully the talent they show with TOTBL develops, and that with maturity they will find their own voice. I've got my fingered crossed for them.But in the end I completely agree with the one reviewer - If you want to hear Joy Division, listen to Joy Division!"
1,cut the bs comparisons and look at it for what it's worth,"Heard 'PDA' and 'NYC' and decided to grab the title after seeing good reviews all around with comparisons to groups I have come to respect. Lacking in the A&R comparisons is the actual quality and substance of Joy Division or the Bunnymen. As of recent, the trend has been to bastardize the philosophy and intent of the punk and branch movements. Of the lot, the Strokes are of a select bunch to emerge from the image machine with something melodic, occasionally original, but catchy and entertaining. As for Interpol, only a few tracks are listenable -'Obstacle 1', 'PDA', and 'Stella'. Lyrically, nothing accounts for the pretentiously absurd nonsense. On the other hand, this is still better than any of the carp on radio. But hey, cool name, post-mod design, and someone seems to think this bs is decent, so you could at least pose and make snide remarks with other music illiterates."
1,"Overhyped???,","Sure the songs are well written, but nothing we haven't heard before. I think if I could just pull the lead singer out, I would dig on this more. He is just so damn monotone and drab, he adds nothing to the music. Put a harmonious chick voice in there with more range and then we're talking."
5,shigidy shwow,"i can't BELIEVE i just saw THAT MANY 1 star reviews IN A ROW.i'm definitly under the impression that the same person did that.anyway, this is a wonderful album. you can ""this sounds like joy division"" all you want, i like this. if it REALLY sounded like joy division, I'D hate it, becuase i don't LIKE JOY DIVISION.dark, brooding, and at the same time a good album to put on while you're sleeping, it's definitly worth getting. If anything, buy it for that guys voice. he sounds SOO good."
4,Interpol,"I definately like this band. They are the best band that imitates that Joy Division kind of atmosphere sound. The other are Longwave and The Stills I'd say. However, both of those bands think they sound like JD by just making a big wall of sound which is not what JD was about. Interpol is therefore the best since they have a sparse sound for most of their songs at least and they have almost perfected that depressing JD sound that everyone tells me they have. On the lyrics side, I'd have to say that these guys definately have the depressing words down cold. They sound kind of mechanical even though they are often about love of some kind. And they always result in something bad - death for example. I appreciate the bass player because he really compliments the singer's voice and makes the music sound whole even though not much is going on. THe minimalist drumming also adds to this. Overall, an excellent package (I'd like to give it a 4.5 stars, but unfortuantely that is impossible)."
5,Underrated indie gem,"This album copped a lot of ""they sound like Joy Division"" remarks when it came out in 2002. I was really into Joy Division around that time so naturally I gave it a go.Yeah, it's reminiscent of Joy Division. At times it also reminds me of The Verve and US indie bands like Low and Cocaine, in that it's an incredibly cinematic sound. I love atmospheric music like that, this does a good job. The vocals are a baritone and the music overall is dark and dreamy, so I can understand the JD comparisons but this has its own sound.Good album, not a derivative ripoff, has its own sound. Recommended."
4,"Very good, worthy of the hype","Interpol does recall Joy Division, but where Joy Division was choppy and unconventional, Interpol is smooth and more melodic. There is a pensive tension throughout the whole album that makes it a very engaging and entertaining listen. What is amazing about the album is the maturity of it. A first release is always allowed some latitude as progress or evolution is part of the fun of finding a new band. But, this album seems quite complete, the songs hit the high points correctly, exploit the catchy parts and use tempo change to really create a pleasant experience.There is the atmosphere of 80's rock that was characteristic of bands like Echo, but the sound is harder. Interestingly, the middle of the album is live which hi-lights the bands ability to put on a good show. They are certainly worthy of mor hype than the Strokes. Their songs are more developed, more mature and vocally much better than the Strokes Vinny Rothbottom or what ever his name is...Interpol good"
4,"Very good for today's music, but flawed, particularly the lyrics","Interpol's mixture of often passionate music, awkward bridges, generally mediocre lyrics, and contemporary detached ""cool"" leaves me less than satisfied. The record is underproduced. Better lyric revision, small changes (like getting rid of the ""this song is called Stella was a diver..."" nonsense), and a dedication toward producing a heart-felt and meaningful record instead of a ""we can toy with you"" mixture of passion and detachment could have made this a great record. The tunes are there, albeit with flaws. Obstacle 1 is a good example. It is quite strong at times, but has really weak parts as well, and the lyrics don't really convince. The best track on the record is the last one, Leif Erickson."
5,Enjoy Division,"Ian Curtis-obsessed american miserabilists with a penchant for all things dark, introspective and generally Mancunian. Desn't sound like much fun does it? Thankfully there is much, much more to Interpol than there was to their angst-ridden heroes.Melodically superb, with a hint of the Smiths'jangle, tight machine-like drumming, dark yet light vocals, all sympathetically produced. Unlike many of the current crop of bands in that they are influenced by the past, but not attempting to replicate it.Turn on the Bright Lights is an instant classic. If you don't get it listen to it again and again until you do. It's worth the effort."
3,Blah,"This album is good. Don't get me wrong. I like it. The thing I don't like is people comparing it to Echo and the Bunnymen. You'd think they never heard either band. These guys sound like The Strokes playing Joy Division songs. It's that simple. It's good stuff, even better when you're drunk and it's playing behind the voices of some friends at a party... but it's not really deserving of any critical acclaim."
3,Ouch.,"Yes, they are a Joy Division cover band. But joy divison were so much more exciting than the art rock coming out of brooklyn these days. Hurray for joy divison and hurray for the band that covers them!"
4,Hindsight will tear us apart,"Damn it all, this actually does sound worse after taking their post-""Bright Lights"" career into account.So, Interpol: Take the philosophy and the production of early-aughts New York (that's Manhattan, not Brooklyn, which makes them either more or less pretentious depending on your perspective), add some deliberately facile lyrics, and coat every song in unvarnished sex.It's straightforward, and brooding, and at times it's really impressive. I still wish I liked it half as much as I used to."
5,"Moody but not depresshing, strong but not harsh.","I can't say that I agree with most of the reviews I've read that compare them to Joy Division, Echo & the Bunnymen or the Furs. Their sound is much too rich. These guys are pure Kitchens of Distinction with a bit of Ride or even early Catherine Wheel thrown in. No surprise that they're already a big name in the UK. I'm amazed at how strong their sound is. You can't listen to this CD with the volume low. Crank it up and let each song build a tidal wave that leaves you gasping for air. I love how the vocals struggle to stay afloat in the swirling sea of rhythm guitars and crashing drums. This is moody, cinematic and even ethereal music...but it truly rocks!"
1,foooooeeeeeey,"a band similar to joy division in that they play musicalinstruments.what is a soundscape, anyway?all the ones ive ever heard are real ugly paintings.you can hang this one over the bed in an ugly hotel room;the same painting in every room in the chain,but dont hang it next to ian curtis."
1,Arrest this band,"Take away the pleasantly dissonant guitar work and you've got Brian Ferry singing ""My Sharona."" Punk (post, pre, or whatever) is (by definition) irreverent. This music is as calculating as anything by Brittany or Justin, except that the lyrics are hoarier."
2,Overhyped???,"Sure the songs are well written, but nothing we haven't heard before. I think if I could just pull the lead singer out, I would dig on this more. He is just so damn monotone and drab, he adds nothing to the music. Put a harmonious chick voice in there with more range and then we're talking."
2,Am I Missing Something?,"OK, so the lyrics are decent (note:decent, not good), but everything else about this band is just pathetic. Granted, they've got a few more influences than just Joy Division, but there's absolutely nothing special about Interpol. Their arrangements aren't the least bit inventive, their rhythm section, while astoundingly tight, don't offer anything beyond the steady tumble cycle of a washing machine. It's too late guys, Sigur Ros already cornered the market on drenching guitars in [a lot] of reverb. and they had the sense to use a bow, ghostly keys, and GOOD SONGS. That's right, Interpol's greatest weakness is their complete lack of a good song. Indie fans need to wake up and realize that slow and dreamy doesn't necessarily equal good. Some dreams are scary, some are exciting. Interpol's are mundane. I'm increasingly convinced that people only like this band so people will think they're sophisticated. Trust me, it's boring music."
2,who cares about hype if you can be cool listening to this?,"i wasn't afraid to give the strokes a listen b/c i didn't care whether or not their hype was due to ""daddy"" or legitmate buzz, so i approached listening to these guys the same way. the music is ok, but i wouldnt say they're bringing anything new to an old game. for what its worth, if you like listening to joy div, the cure, or the smiths, then just keep on doing that. if you need another band in that genre that doesn't seem to push anything forward, then you can be cool caught listening to this..."
2,"Music great, lyrics lame","A friend gave me this album because he said it was the sort of thing I listen to, which offended me after I heard how lame most of the lyricism and singing was. This reads like a teenage angst journal that should have stayed under the bed. Band: get a new singer."
5,Excelente,"Por fín alguien se decidió o tuvo el coraje de recoger la antorcha que dejaron encendida grupos de hace 15 años como The Chamaleons o The Sound.Una excelente colección de canciones que redefinen un sonido que creíamos desaparecido pero que, felizmente, sigue vivo.Al fín algo brillante en estos tiempos de música aburrida."
4,"25 Years later, Joy Division finally has a succesor","The English legends Joy Division made two very dark albums at the end of the 70's. Now a fivesome from New York City has finally picked up where Joy Division ended.They sound better, there is a great sounding wall of electric guitar noise and synthisezir on the background, The bass drives all the songs, sometimes even with single notes that do not seem to fit but add something extra to the songs.They have borrowed some minimalistic elements from the 80's Sonic Youth making it dreamy, hypnotizing and spacy at the same time. I haven't been impressed much by some of the albums of the last 5 years but this one definitely is one of the best. Just put on your headphones, blindfold the room or yourself and listen, it's great."
3,kickin' it ol' school,"I agree with a previous review...they definitely remind me of Kitchens of Distinction. I'm glad to see (hear) a lot of new artists return to the [quality] roots of ""alternative"" rock, those bands of the 80s and early-90s that never really got credit for their efforts and achievements."
5,Sounds awesome no matter how you describe it.,"I have read the customer reviews and frankly agree with most of you who think that it doesn't matter what Interpol sounds like...they rock! And that's all that matters. It is a refreshing sound that they have created on ""Turn On the Bright Lights."" And when I am soaring above the Shomali Plains of Afghanistan in a helicopter at sunset...that music...well...it makes for a mesmerizing flight!"
3,Its Good But not THAT Good,"I walked into the record store to purchase this album expecting the voice of God to enlighten me and save me forever thanks to all the hype this album recieved.Obviously I was disappointed, no divine guitar solos here. Just simple layered guitars and a singer who sounds like he missed the Talking Heads audition by a few notes. I'm trying to say, don't buy the hype. Its a decent album, ""Stella is a Diver..."" is a great track so are the 'Obstacles', but I don't see what's revolutionary or particularly unique about this album. Check out any rock band formed in the 80s and you'll find a similar guitar pattern and singing style.All in all a good retro vibe album, but no guest tracks with God (Don't buy the hype on this one)."
4,Strange Free World revisited,"I like the album a lot, and any deviation from today's pop music is a gift. Interpol has some excellent guitar work, anxious vocals, and a wall of sound that reminds me of alternative music of the 80's. I do not see the comparisons to Echo, but I can see a little Joy Division and Furs. The most striking comparison however would be with the 1990 release of Strange Free World by Kitchens of Distinction."
1,They Stink!!,"Sorry, I know alot of you folks like this stuff - for some reason - but this band stinks! In trying to sound like a hodge podge of 80s bands (err - sorry they don't sound like JD) more like the Furs - they sound like no one. That is they have no soul or sound to call their own - they are just another long line of bands who go through their record collection for a 'sound' or songs - because they can't figure out how they want to sound. The only song I thought was OK was the one that sound like it was a complete [copy] of the Smiths. Which is fitting since the Smiths were the LAST pop band that had its own sound..."
3,When did the Strokes and Devo hook up?,"None of the hip magazines told me that the Strokes and Devo combined to make an album! This is pretty good stuff, in a robotic, New York City-like way. Devo's melody-free irony mixed with the Strokes irony-laden lyrics and constant guitar-strummed chiming...pretty good indeed.Hey, I heard that Hagar is back with Halen. Is this true? If so, what about David ""the maniac"" Roth? I thought he was back in the fold. Someone please leave message.BYE!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Boring Boring Boring...,Did you ever see the movie Sid and Nancy? Sid and Johnny eating beans and hating the tedious monotony of their lives. Yelling out BORING BORING BORING and then the classic Daleks inpersonation EXTERMINATE EXTERMINATE. That's how I feel every time I hear this band.No imagination whatsoever.If you're older than 25 you've already heard much better variations of this type of music so please don't bother with Interpol. They offer nothing original. If you're under 25 then this sound is probably new to you so you'll probably think it's cool to like this band.Life is wasted on youth.
1,Thud,"Man, I really must have missed the point on this one. This album is about as refreshing as swamp gas. Sounds like it was recorded in a wet paper bag. Does the guitarist know more than five chords? Wonderful what you can accomplish with a lot of distorted echo-y stuff. These guys sound like a catatonic U2. Comparisons to the Furs and Echo are insulting (to them, that is). Kitchens Of Distinction was grinding out this bucket of sludge years ago (rigor mortis in 3/4). Let these guys break new ground and provide their own headstone."
1,Horrid and Boring ... don't believe the hype,.... truly terrible beyond belief.... this would be played as punishment in prisons if it weren't cruel and all-too-usual... and good arguement for for a no star rating option
1,Seriously though,It's funny how music fans invest so much emotion and time into these bands that fly so far below the radar that they will never have an effect on other bands and in ten years time (at its extreme) will be largely forgotten and sold back to the cd store for the next newer repo-bands. People that don't buy into the major label bands jettison the fact that many of these musicians (please don't call them artists) have had a lasting effect on other musicians. Miles Davis for example. Hendrix for example. Simon and Garf for example. Ask yourself this if you're deciding against a major label band vs a poor man's Joy Division: Was I missing out on something genuine when my dollars went towards this garbage instead. Think about how little time you have on Earth and how better spent it would be to go with Bill Evans. Maybe when you're on your deathbed you'll realize how much a wasted life you were by devoting so much to so little.
2,"I'm sorry, but.....","...does anyone else think that if the singer in this band kills himself, the rest of them will go on to be a huge success and record the biggest selling 12-inch single of all time?"
3,Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery,"So the remaining, i.e. living members of Joy Division/New Order, Echo and the Bunnymen and the Psychedelic Furs should be quite happy with their young disciples Interpol. Interpol are not great, but not bad either. They are revivalists of a sort rather than originators. Which is not necessarily a bad thing because they add something of themselves while resurecting a good sound. I saw them at the 9:30 Club in D.C. last year and they were entertaining. Interpol are derivitive its true, but I like TOTBL nonetheless though since I was a huge fan of Joy Division and that early '80s sound and Interpol do it well. It's cool that someone is following in JD's dark footsteps."
1,"SPINNING IN HIS GRAVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,","IAN CURTIS WAS A ROCK GOD and nobody but his family and band members should be allowed to make money from his creations.Interpol are a talented bunch of kids with good taste in music who should have directed their talent into creating something new instead of RIPPING OFF JOY DIVISION!Hopefully the talent they show with TOTBL develops, and that with maturity they will find their own voice. I've got my fingered crossed for them.But in the end I completely agree with the one reviewer - If you want to hear Joy Division, listen to Joy Division!"
1,A Case for Mass Delusion,"What exactly do people like about this disc? Usually, when an act reaches the level of acclaim Interpol has, there is at least something likable about them. I can't find a single thing to recommend about this disc. Wake up people...the lyrics not only are pretentious and cumbersome...but they are also meaningless. The music is uninspired and dull. The performances sound forced (especially that whole ""Stella I love you"" bit...ugh). People are going to have to travel to sell this sucker once they wake up and realize it's not Joy Division they're listening to. Let's hope it happens soon, because I am going to lash out next time somebody tries to pass off this overwrought tripe as something worth listening to."
1,Oh dear !,A friend of mine said 'Listen to this album'.So I did and didn't realise that Kitchens Of Distinction were still going !! In anger I leant him all of KOD's back catalogue and he was left speachless by that group's brilliance . Interpol ? An incredibly poor man's KOD.
1,Boring Boring Boring,Did you ever see the movie Sid and Nancy? Sid and Johnny eating beans and hating the tedious monotony of their lives.

2,almost a 3,i dont want to bash this band i had nothing personal against them. but i was looking around cdnow and i came across this band a couple of times and ive never heard of them so i got the cd to listen. the thing about this band is its not psychedelic at all like everyone says. the drums and guitars were nothing fancy very simple. and after 7 songs it just got a little bland. noene of the songs seemed to have a climax point to it it just sort of faded away. for those of you who are realkly hardcore into the new york scene might find this album perfect but as a casual listener i didnt find it as good as they should have been
1,Uninspired Drivel,"At what point does a tribute band become shameless rip off artists? I would say w/ this Interpol album. You can hear bits of Gang of Four, The Chameleons, PIL, and Joy Division throughout. The guitar interplay completely rips off The Chameleons circa ""Script of the Bridge"". Completely empty is how you feel after listening to this - and you'll find yourself reaching for your copy of ""second edition"" or ""entertainment!"". This guys voice is awful - a shame they can't ape the amazing vocals of Mark Burgess or Ian Curtis. The worlds biggest cover band is on display with this release. Save your money and save originality."
4,Don't call it a comeback (of the 80s sound),"Yes, it sounds a lot like Joy Division, yes, the lyrics make less sense than old Beck (""The subway is a porno""? ""Friends don't waste wine when there's words to sell.""?). Did it bother you with Beck? Did you not like Joy Division? This is a compulsively-listenable CD, and as for the charge that they're just 80s recyclers, I'll quote the _Boston Phoenix_'s Annie Zaleski:""It's in alluding to these bands that Interpol find their own charms -- not as post-punk clones, but as preservers and extenders of a sound and an era."""
5,100% awesome,"i just have to say that this probably my most favorite cd that i own. recently just getting into indie rock music, i have found that i absolutely LOVE this sort of music. and you will too. it is just such a great cd. ""stella was a diver and she was always down"" is possibly my favorite song off of the album. it's even hard to choose a favorite!if you haven't boughten this already, BUY IT.your money will be very well spent."
4,"Atmospheric, haunting, brooding and BRILLIANT!","One of the best debut albums by a band in the past ten years! They are the most promosing band since Coldplay no doubt. Songs like Obstacle 1, Stella..., and NYC are just amazing. If you don't like the album on the first listen, then you'll probably love it after a few listens. It WILL grow on you. Yes, don't listen old, jaded reviewers giving this album a 1 star. This album is great. The only reason it didn't get a 5 is because it's not perfect, very few albums are."
4,Focused filters,"Still one of the better introductive indie rock releases of the decade, guided by a boldly assertive streak of beginning tracks, Interpol's debut avoids a conscious songwriting strain early success brought with future output, instead providing more effortlessly angular, darkened pop, properly emulating the oft-milked Joy Division prototype."
3,"No, no - stop the Joy Division comparisons",The correct comparisons for their best songs is with Kitchens of Distiction and the Wedding Present. I like about half the songs on the album alot. The other half are just ok.
4,Worth a listen.,"I will admit the first time I listened to it, I thought each song kind of sounded the same. However after listening to it once or twice I have more appreciation for each individual song. Worth a listen. 4/5"
3,Tubular!,"Ah, this album sounds like bygone youth. At least that's what I think whenever I hear it. I takes me back to the sounds of the mid eighties and its cornucopia of wave bands, infusing in me those memories of hyper serious teen confusion, sorrow and ecstasy. The lyrics attempt to convey a emotional legitimacy that I just can't seem to buy into. Their sound is definitely complex and refreshing, even if it is a mash up of once cool 80's formulae. By most accounts, one of the best albums of its year... for me, its good, but not not my favorite by far. In my play lists as a nice mix with Radiohead, Constantines, Hot Hot Heat, Psychadelic Furs, The Church, and Echo and the Bunnymen. This display of talent has me hoping that the brightest lights are yet to be turned on."
3,"A solid album, but not perfect.","I'm a bit of a dilettante when it comes to Interpol. I've had this album for ages, but the production and overly long song lengths have always kept me from really getting into it. The first four songs are obviously fantastic, but by then my tolerance has usually worn out and I'm unable to appreciate those which follow. Like so many of my fickle, reactionary peers, I too was forced to reassess the band in light of the recent leak of ""Antics"", their forthcoming second album. Fortunately, those problems I have with ""Bright Lights"" have been addressed on ""Antics"", and my enthusiasm for that album is such that I think I'm finally able to see some of the better aspects of this one. Surely, you don't need me to enumerate everything that the fans and critics have repeated at length for the last several years. Most of it is needless hyperbole anyway, but simply know that beneath the reverb is music of often remarkable beauty and passionate expression."
4,Pretty Good,"Well, I bought this CD used recently, and had no idea about all the 'politics' involved. However, speaking as someone who owns more than two Joy Division albums, I kind of like it. It's been in my CD rotation for a couple months now.The first track is kind of Mazzy Starish, which is cool. But the rest is, yes, a rip off of Ian et al. But hey, they closed up shop a while ago. Why not enjoy something that obviously pays homage to their genius? Even though they are making money off unoriginality, so to speak....it's actually pretty original if you think about it and actually listen to it a few times. Go on, give yourself leave to enjoy it!"
1,boring,"Yawn. Another bunch of hipster darlings who get way too much credit. They've added a little bit of joy division darkness to distinguish their own brand of trendiness from the harder-rocking fakery of the Strokes, but it still comes out boring. Doesn't anyone realize that goth bands have been making ""interesting soundscapes"" with ""dark themes"" and echoing ""joy division and the psychedelic furs"" for years? And although goth bands have produced more than their share of boring pabulum, the best ones haven't ever been noticed outside of small circles -- but as soon as Interpol sounds a little like joy division or The Faint figures out how to use an arpeggiator they're suddenly new and exciting. The only surprising thing about 'turn on the bright lights' is the bizarre, snarky sense of humor that lurks behind the suicidal posturings -- maybe if they let more of that out to play they'd be more than another lame trend."
1,Stinky McStinker,"This c.d, in every sense of the word, STINKS!I have never brought a stinkier c.d, i have alot of c.d's and this is definately the STINKIEST.I...am out. Raged."
3,Pretty OK,"I bought this based on other eviews, and while I can't say I ak disappointed, I can't Im jumping up and down either. The Joy Division meets the Strokes has its moments, but I recommend it at 2nd hand prices."
3,Okay,"Man, I had this cd and thought--boy, they sure dress like Josef K! Then I listened to a few more songs, besides the parts that sounded like a gothier U2/Radiohead, to the songs that sounded like a less inspired Josef K. So the moral of this story is, spring for the 3 Josef K CDs sold on Amazon.com--a truly amazing band, the real thing from the early '80s. Basically, this is retro mixed with a modern Radiohead/U2 vibe...if that sounds good to you by all means buy it. My big problem with this is that I don't feel there's much variety here, the songs tend to have too much of the same vibe/techniques/formula from song to song...but they sure dress nice, right?"
1,This Sucks!!!!!!!!!,"I'm just so gash darned ticked off that I trusted all these reviewers that gave TOTBL a high rating. Based on those 'Best Album of the Year' and '5 Star' reviews I went out and laid down my 18 dollars. I am very disappointed as I didn't like the music on this CD at all. I thought it showed contempt for the listening public by offering a poor version of a great rock-n-roll style, Post-Punk. I had my suspicions and felt that all the people who'd given them 1 star must not have an open mind to new bands. Something I've always felt I possessed. Unfortunately I was proved wrong.Find a friend and borrow this CD and find out for yourself. 30 second sound samples on Amazon and at the CD store aren't enough. Listen to the whole CD then decide for youself.Burned and bummed out..."
3,Promising,"Starts off well, the first 5 tracks are all very good but the album really drags from there on with little distinction between each song. Many of the songs suffer from being overly long and in turn sound unfinished. It seems the band was a little too preoccupied with creating atmosphere rather than memorable songs on their debut album. However there is still promise here. Interpol shows that when they get it right they are wonderful (PDA, NYC)."
2,Another Derivative CD Hyped By Pitchfork,"To me, Interpol is the musical equivalent of an amalgamation of last night's dinner scraps (my mom used to call these things ""casserole surprise"") - it looks familiar but doesn't taste nearly as good.Interpol is best in small doses. In fact, if I listen to PDA as a single, it's actually an excellent track. But, if I listen to the entire CD, the songs begin to merge together, and by mid-album, I'm falling asleep. Lately when I listen to Turn On the Bright Lights, I find I get completely bored at about the time Hands Away comes on, and I end up switching to a different album. So, admittedly, I am more familiar with the first half of the album. However, I did listen to the CD all the way through before writing this review (the things I do for Amazon), and I have to say that I haven't been missing much.If you like Interpol, great, but if you're buying into the Pitchfork hype, then I suggest looking elsewhere."
5,Happy and Sad at the same time...beautifully,"Like many of my fave bands Interpol treads the line between depression and euphoria, but for some reason I notice this more with Interpol. See also Clientele, Vitesse, Galaxie 500,"
5,Great album; never get tired of listening to it.,"I bought this after hearing ""Stella"" on XM radio. I've had this for over 2 years and the songs never get old. It's a timeless sound and I always enjoy pulling it out and playing it."
5,Guitar Driven Melancholia,"Sure, the connections to Joy Division and others are there, but to me they sound a whole lot like the ""today forever"" release by Ride from the mid 90's. This is a good thing. For some of us over thirty types, it's strangely comforting to hear these chords and soundscapes again, strange because they seem to celebrate impermanance. Newer listeners will enjoy being propelled along by the architecture of the songs. Overall, a great effort."
4,Interpol's precursors,"The comparisons to Joy Division have been legion, and while I see the analogy, these guys are not quite as gloomy nor anywhere as Gothic. (And the Psychedelic Furs -- those talentless twerps? Hardly worth remembering, much less mentioning in the same breath as this.) But what I hear (and I bet I catch hell for this) are echoes of REM's very first (1981) EP, ""Chronic Town"": mumbled lyrics (before Stipe caught Bono-messiah disease); jangly, hypnotic guitars; dense, interwoven rhythms. Not esp. catchy the first time around, but it grows on you and then won't let go."
4,Interpol's Debut Works Best as a Whole,"This is an album that works as a whole. Each song flows into the next song, giving it a life and vitality that I feel would be absent if the songs were seperated and isolated from the ones around them. Indeed, no song feels complete on its own. That isn't to say I don't enjoy particular songs: I love the guitar sounds and flow of ""Untitled"" and ""Obstacle 1"" has some really great melodies. But, to me, it is still an album to sit back and enjoy from beginning to end. There are songs that I enjoy, but the experience of listening to the album as a whole is so good that I rarely pick and choose particular songs to visit. That is what makes this album special. It is a mood record. Put it on while driving at night or as background music by which to read. Enjoy it as a whole and embrace the mood that it exudes."
5,"Wow, what an album","Turn on the Bright Lights has practicaly blown me away everytime I listen to it. I love it more and more with every listen. To name some of the great things about this CD is it is amazingly catchy, you find yourself singing along to every song. Even though it is very catchy it is also accompanied by some very intelligent lyrics. Another great thing about this band is they have pretty unique style. There aren't many bands who are playing dark post-punk, right now but this CD has already spawned a bit of a post-punk movement.This is one of the most classic albums of the last decade, if you are a big music fan you should own this CD."
5,Just Listen To The Music,"Forget about the reviews, the constant comparisons to Joy Division (yes, they do sound alike) and just listen to the music. I'm not one who tries to disect every chord, every note; I can only tell you that the songs sound amazing. They lend a very mellow, atmospheric mood that is perfect for any time (or emotion.) And, anyways, even if you don't care much for the smart, insightful lyrics... get it for Carlos' great bass riffs."
5,Was there a better debut in 2002?,"Interpol has easily turned out one of the best discs of 2002 if not the best. As debut's go you will be hard pressed to find a better one. From beginning till end it safe to say there isn't a weak track, although I admit the album does have to be listened to a couple of times to see that. Sure it isn't an album that has classic written all over it like the Stone Roses debut or Unknown Pleasures, but in time I think people will come to see how good it actually is. The question is now whether they ever will be able to top it. That has yet to be seen, but as of right now it is safe to say this is something special, even if it isn't entirely original but what really is? Almost any band you ever really hear you can tell they sound like someone, how well they can disguise it is all that matters and they disguise it very well I think. Enjoy this record people, not many like this come along."
5,"Really, Really Good",Everybody's comparing it to everything. Just shut up and listen. Best alternative stuff I've heard in eons. Wow.
1,Has this author ever considered the victims?,"I am appalled and shocked at the lack of respect and consideration for the victims and their families in this book. Did this author not believe family members and friends would open this book up, only to find these horrible true crime pictures of people they loved staring back at them. For whatever reason, I consider this tacky, unprofessional and yellow journalism. This type of sensationalism of the crime only victimizes those people again and again."
5,Excellent photo album,"The 8x10 photo album was exactly as advertised. It is well made and the photo display sheets are completely clear, but substantial."
5,A True Gem,"Once again, Aishwarya Rai comes through. Capt Karan comes off field duty to take two months leave and visit his beloved Nisha when he suddenly encounters young Sahiba running from trouble. He helps her out twice and decides to take her home and assist her to confront her angry father scolding her for her rebelliousness. Everyone in the family, except Dad, welcomes him with open arms believing Karan to be Sahiba's husband. Before Karan can explain the truth, he's suddenly become a part of the family, an experience he's never had before. Sahiba eventually falls in love with him.But Karan has his own life to lead, and the chararade has to end at some point. The story then goes off in a very interesting direction.Enjoyable musical numbers. Worth the watch."
2,Kaballah of The Da Vinci Code,"This is not a book for the average christian. If you agree with the theology of ""The Da Vinci Code"" you will love this book. The author reaches up into heaven, and pulls Yeshua (Jesus) off of the throne, and makes him only a man. She has him being married, being the father of the apostles John and James (because rabbis had to be married, and the father of a son, according to Hebrew tradition...which Yeshua seldom followed!), and surviving his crucifixion. It is an interesting read, it gives much information about the various aspects of each sephirah, but I disagreed with much of the ""christian"" part."
1,NO size is given on any Studio Silversmith products,"I have looked a several Studio Silversmith products and they never tell you a size, measurements. I want to know the size of a product I am picking, not just words like Large or the weight, but real measurements."
4,Good sharpening system with lots of options and easier angle setting,"Comparing to Spyderco Tri-Angle Sharpmaker Knife Sharpener has more sharpeners. Also it's easier to make proper angle here. But it is less handy to use for me, and easier to get cut during sharpening. I'm going to use it for hard cases, and use Spyderco's as a basic sharpener."
3,perplexed,"I owned the Lansky sharpening system which I wore out and wanted to replace. I love the result and ease of using the sharpening stones, however, my prior kit did a better job:1. with holding the knife in the clamping devise. I do not know what is different about how it is made from the prior unit I have, but this one keepsdropping the knives which is a little dangerous, so I am using my old clamp which works great.2. a couple of the sharpening hones come loose from the guide rods, no matter how hard I tighten them downIf you are diligent, this system does do a great job, but you really need to pay close attention not to get hurt or ruin the job that you have done if things become loose."
1,Very awkward sharpener,"The Lansky sharper may be an excellent system, but when I tried to use it on my kitchen knives I was extremely disappointed.The holder would not hold my knives securely and they kept falling out of the holder. The one knife I did manage to sharpen seemed to have a good edge but it is such a pain in the rear that I have pretty much given up on using it in the kitchen and have gone back to my Arkansas stone and full manual sharpening.System may be good for shorter knives and pocket knives."
5,Great sharpening solution,"I own a number of Benchmade pocket knives and usually keep them sharp with one of the ceramic V pocket sharpeners. Recently, I bought a used Benchmade knife with an M2 blade. The M2 blade is the hardest steel you can get in a pocket knife and is currently out of production because it is so difficult to work with. The knife I bought had been poorly sharpendd and needed the edge angle changed.I researched different methods on the web and finally found the Lansky YouTube video that shows exactly how to use the product.I am certainly happy with the outcome. The diamond hones are the only thing that could reshape the M2 edge in any reasonable amount of time. They made quick work of the process and I finished it off with the separate extra fine hone that others have recommended.The results were so good that I sharpened two additional knives while I was at it. My left arm is now pretty much bald from testing their ability to shave hair."
2,FLIMSY SETUP - NOT FOR LARGER KNIVES!,"FLIMSY SETUP - NOT FOR LARGER KNIVES!Has its uses but is way over priced. Not real good for larger knives, it seems to work best on pocket knives, but then again I don't need it for pocket knives as smaller knives are easily sharpened with just a stone.The clamp doesn't hold well for heavier knives and marred my Ka Bar fighting knifes black finish.It did a somewhat better job than a Smiths Pocket Pal but in the end I finished with the fine stone on the Pocket Pal.It would be good for re-profiling, but bottom line is I would not buy again."
2,"Ok for some applications, skip if you have Japanese kitchen knives","Pretty flimsy construction and cheap feel for the price.You can skip it entirely if you own Japanese kitchen knives (Shun etc.) as the angle will not be steep enough. In spite of how it is marketed it really is not a good all around set up. Try the Lansky Crock Sticks. Simple, good quality unit that will take care of all but serrated blades.Buy some Crock Sticks with medium & fine ceramic rods & a strop with some polishing rouge for much better results & save about 25 bucks.For many sporting knives the stones are also too wide for proper contact, depending on blade type (especially any mild recurve).I was very disapointed after reading the reviews and then purchasing. So, buyer be aware of the product limitations."
4,Lansky Diamond Hones,"I have used the standard Lansky system since the 1980s. Recently while browsing at Amazon I saw the diamond system and was intrigued. So I ordered one and when it arrived tried it out on a friend's chef knife. I was very pleased with how quickly the coarse stone put a new edge on the knife. The sharpening process took a lot less time than what I had figured. One caveat, I was happier with the finished edge that my LS 1000 Ultra Fine stone left than the one that the Fine Diamond finisher ended up with. If you buy the diamond system you may wish to invest in either the yellow ultra fine hone or the super sapphire hone to finish your edges."
3,Lansky sharpener,"Nice setup, easy to use, but if you get the diamond, which I did, get the fine or extra fine ""stone"" which I didn't. You need something finer than what is supplied for that extra sharp edge."
2,Disappointed,"After all the good things I had heard about lansky i was excited to get my skinning and filet knives sharp with this. When it arrived on of the stones had come out of its plastic holder. since then several more stones have come out of there holders. This can be fixed with epoxy or super glue, but this oversight in manufacturing made me question the overall quality of the product and so i have seldom used them."
3,Coleman Exponent Feather Review,"The stove burns good on high, but flames out if you try and run it down to a low simmering temp."
4,Great stove,"It will go down to simmer. I got it because the fuel storage is incorporated in the unit. I wish coleman had put a little more effort in designing it , and put a little sturdier metal into it. Also this picture isnt the stove i got. I recieved the Canadian model. The same just Green and not as flashy a logo."
2,"Well done, apart from one deal breaker","The stove itself is solidly built and easy to operate. Works just fine. Nevertheless, after filling in the fuel, there's no way how to remove it from the tank - unless you are willing to dismantle the pump and/or the burner tip each time. I bought the stove for my trip to Iceland not to be worried by searching for gas shells all the time, but once I arrived to Keflavik Int. I realized that the Berlin's Tegel airport security guards removed the stove from my backpack and threw it away as they considered it forbidden article. Technically they were right as the tank still contained a tiny amount of fuel which I couldn't burn away or otherwise empty out. The funny part is that I only used it once when testing it at home, cooking probably the most expensive pasta in my life (1 for pasta and 100 for the stove).If you plan to buy a stove for long-range trips where you need to use a plane, try another one."
5,To know the Heart Of God!!!,This book should be read by everyone in the world. It is a must!!! Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. IT made me Have tears of joy 3 times during my reading...then I went and bought 4 more of his books...all great...but the best was Joshua!! You have to read it.
5,Shines a bright light on how misled Christians have become.,"The hypocrisy of todays churches is exposed and challenged by this clever and needed character created by Mr. Grizone. This may be the most inspiring novel outside of the Gospels in terms of knowing how a true follower of Christ is to live. I would recommend this book to anyone that feels like they don't fit into their church community. Rules of ""religion"" are made for the people that create them. Joshua shows that the only laws God has are to love and be humble. If we all just followed these basic guidelines, we wouldn't need church leaders to lead us astray."
5,This book is enlightening.,The context of living the true Christian life is spelled out in this book. A life of peace that we long for is portrayed for us. Living the peaceful life is a quest that few complete.
3,Loved it,"I thought this story was very warm and inspiring. It spoke about my feelings about organized religion. And Joshua was so lovable. I got chills at the end. I was sorry the story had ended, because I actually missed Joshua, too. So I'm on to read the next Joshua story.My only complaint was also in the editing as one person pointed out. I felt the author stepped out from behind the curtain at some points and interjected his own feelings and disgust about things that weren't coming from the character of Joshua at that time. So the comments stuck out like a sore thumb and I resented them. It only happened a few times, though, and for the most part I had a most enjoyable read."
5,Beautiful,"This book is by far one of the best books I have ever read. It is truly inspirational. I found that it is like reading about Jesus in modern times and it helped me see how I can be more like Him. Fascinating book and wonderfully written. I recommend this book to everyone who is slightly interested in what Jesus was like, what He thought and how we can strive to be more like Him. Absolutely beautiful book."
5,A True Inspiration,"I have read this amazing book over and over since I first bought it many years ago. Every time I read it, I gain something more from it. It is a simple, heartwarming story with a REAL hero. It is very easy to read and very difficult to put down. I have bought copies of this book for others and they in turn have bought copies to pass on. This book is THAT good. I have yet to discuss this book with anyone who did not enjoy it. I have no doubt that Joseph Girzone knows Jesus, for he has captured the true spirit of Christ in ""Joshua""."
1,Oh God...this Time I really need help!!!!!!,"I had to read this book for school. It's times like that, that make me want to go to a public School!!!!!"
4,Barry is an immigrant.,"Barry you don't know regular grammar? Is it THAT hard to use proper English and use apostrophes. Joshua was a decent book, it was an easy read and kept me fairly interested. If I knew what Barry was saying maybe I would agree with him, but he can't pronounce th's. I must say that Joshua gives everyone a new look on almost all religions. Catholicism needs to be looked at differently, and this gives the new view we all need.I could go on for much longer but the bottom line is this was a good book, I don't like rambling like immigrants."
1,MY LARGE HEADED TEACHER (bc) MADE ME READ THIS JUNK,"If you bother to take the time to read this book, there is some sort of mental block in your cranium. Why not just sit on the john and read an Oprah magazine? This book is so poorly written, you might stop mid-sentence and fall asleep. You might have more fun playing badminton with a 7 year old than reading this."
1,Ack!,"What a sermon! The author is a priest who retired for health reasons, I can only guess we are talking about mental health here! The dialogue is so forced, I could hear nails screeching down the chalkboard. The author may have a few good points, but this book seems mostly to have been written as a way to avenge himself against people and policies that he perceived to offend/injure him in some way."
3,too simplistic for such a complex concept,"I found this book to be not too particularly well-written. The dialogue was forced and contrived to say the least. If you were to compare it to the beautiful language contained in the Bible or other great pieces of literature, then this book falls way short of being a masterwork. Having said this however, I must say that I happen to agree with a lot of the messages contained in the book. Religion has become too structured and free will seems not to be stressed as much as dogmatic teachings in most organized religions. Many religious leaders seem to have somehow lost the true message of Christ and seem to be more concerned with what ends up in the collection plate at Sunday Mass,at least in my experience. While I did enjoy many of the messages contained in the book, I just feel it was too simplistic to be a truly effective book."
5,Joshua,"I enjoyed every page of this book! How I wish Joshua would appear in my life for real. So many of my own personal beliefswere portrayed in this book. I was raised Methodist and con-verted to Catholic at my marriage. As a result I was saying""Amen!"" frequently as I read. I have now read three more booksin the Joshua series and all are excellent. I have also beengiving these books as gifts."
1,Changed my life,"I now believe in a big, bad, bullying God who needs to be propitiated - He is certainly punishing us with this book and now with a film, too. I heard that Girzone initially wrote a book on Satan coming to a small town and setting up shop as a bad author, but realized that he wouldn't have as much of a chance at having a bestseller or a movie deal so he changed a few words and here is the result."
1,I'm insulted...,that a tree lost it's life over such a wretched book. I can't believe people have wasted their time on such a childish story. Anyone with a 11th grade education could identify that this book is poorly written.
1,?,Do we really need another religious book? The answer is apparently yes when this was released and kids were forced to read it at school making them want to pry their eyes out and eat them because that might be more fun than reading this book.
4,Guidelines For Living,I think that everyone should read Joshua because it tells you how God wants us to live and how clergymen are teaching religion differently from how God intended it to be taught. How priests and ministers try to rule their congregations by force instead of with love. And of course Joshua is a character who lives a very simple life and everyone is attracted to him. This book was great!
4,Very Good!,"I have just completed reading the Bible as part of a 3-page a day quest. This book helped to make sense of that endeavor. It is the story of Jesus coming back in the 20th Century. The writing wasn't the best and the editing left much to be desired with many errors, but the story was very powerful and I would suggest it to those young and old alike."
5,A great gift and inspiration!,Have gifted this book dozens of times since reading it decades ago. God Bless Joseph Girzone for introducing this wonderfully forgiving soul in such a warm and friendly way.
4,Inspiring,"This is one of the great feel good books. It is fiction, but I think inspired. The ending is a little sad, but the seeds of progress have been sown."
4,Be of an open mind....,"Although I am only about half way done, I must say that I love this book. But, and a big BUT here, this book will make you question your faith, not in God, but in your beliefs and their structure. This is not for the fainthearted. This book will bring you to tears in that we, the people living today, are not that far removed from the Jews/Romans/Pagans of Jesus' time. There are good and bad in all. Pilate's wife became one of the followers of Christ and begged Pontius not to act. Nicodemus was one of the Jews in charge, but was Jesus' friend.So, what would happen if Jesus plunked himself down in your neighborhood? How many would accept him? How would your area be torn apart? Look at the fight going on now in Alabama over the 10 Commandments..the only religion that is winning is the Atheist...so 1% dictates..just like 2000 years ago. And we believe we are better off than then? Ha! Nice try."
2,Not Much to It,"Clearly this book has been very meaningful to many of the people who read it. It touched their wounds, validated their anger, and provided them with an alternative to the Jesus that was presented to them in their churches. This book is deeply loved by some. Fine. But I don't find much in this book that captures my imagination or evokes my thought. The book is thin. I have my own complaints about the way Jesus is presented in many churches. But I certainly am not so naive as to think Girzone's Jesus is closer to what we find in the Gospels. Jesus was not so one dimensional. The religious leaders didn't oppose him because they misunderstood him. His words and presence was a threat to them and not by accident. Girzone's ""nice guy"" Jesus might have rubbed some narrow religious leaders in the wrong way. But this Jesus doesn't have enough substance to have warranted crucifixion."
2,"Read the Gospels, not this book to learn about Jesus","I give this book 2 stars because it has its good points and it attepts it include all religions into Gods love and his plan. Jesus loves us all, not just Christians. And it seems this book tries to portray this.But it is very tough to write a story about what Jesus would be like be in todays world. And I think this book misses the mark on many things about who Jesus is. I would think you would have to know Jesus very well to take on a book like this and have it be accurate. Maybe you would have to be a saint yourself.This book also attacks the Catholic church and draws a false picture of the church and its leaders and what the church really stands for. My advise is that if you want to learn about the real Catholic Church, read the Caticism of the Catholic Church and some of the writings of Pope John Paul II.One side note, the movie was much better and many of the bad points of the book were not included."
1,Where's the depth?,"This story lacked any character development. I don't see why people would be so mystified by Joshua. All the characters were simply written. I didn't like the book at all. Perhaps it was written for fifth graders? Was thinking it may instill some good discussion in my book club but I thank my lucky stars I never picked it. I barely finished it, it was AWFUL."
5,Great book!,"I am a teenage girl and read this book in one weekend. It has made me think about life through a different angle and realize that Jesus comes in all forms.Joshua provided a lead of how I should live my life, plain, simple, and humble. A good book for those on a quest for a closer relationship with God."
5,Wonderful!!!,"This book had everything true about it. All Joshua said was pure fact. This is actually the REAL way. This book is so well written too. It is such a touching story. He is so humble. This is a perfect example of real religion. Buy it, its great!"
5,Joshua Parable for Today was wonderful!,This was an amazing book and wonderful story. I truly enjoyed the characters and the excellent way the book was written. This will be a great book for my teenage grandaughters to read. I will recommend it to all my friends. I purchased a copy for our pastor to read and share.
5,the best book i've read...,this book really opened my eyes to what god really is and actually the meaning of life... i've recomended this book to everyone. it's great. very insightful.
2,Simplicity Was Overdone,"Allegorical literature is tough to write and still capture the essense of the original, especially when the theme is as well known and studied as Jesus Christ. There were some very good conceptual points which addressed the ritualizaiton appended to the simplicity of the Gospel. I got that message the first time I read it - and did not need the repetitive presentation. Clearly, Christian organizations have embellished the words of Jesus with mixed results over history.Based on that fact, I would have rated the book higher.The writing style, however, left me cold. I checked to see if I was reading a children's book with an adult theme. The prose was so unimaginative that it detracted from the meaning. To readers who disagree, please read the dialoge with another person and try not to laugh. This book could have been better with a professional editor or co-author."
4,"Make available for Kindle, please!","One of my favorite modern day stories of Jesus. Would LOVE to put this on my kindle, pretty please!:)"
3,Easy read,"Considering that the book was written from a 1980's perspective and it was a first novel, I thought it was quite an easy read. The book was assigned to our adult book club in a Roman Catholic Church and generated some lively discussion. I think the portrayal of Christ was done well and the ending generated a lot of discussion. I recommend it for all ages above 12."
5,Joshua,Wonderful novel by Father Joseph Girzone. Fr. Joe sees the Jesus of love and compassion who embracesall unconditionally. Great book by a great author. If you're looking for a refreshing novel that views Jesus as a contemporary figure... this is it. I've given away several copies knowing that it will bless others as much as it has blessed me. I highly recommend it.
1,Unhappy camper,I had ordered a hard cover copy and received a paperback. I did not have time to return due to homecare of terminally ill client.
4,A simple message that should be listened to more........,"JOSHUA is a ""what if"" type story: What if Jesus came back today? Would he be disappointed in this fast paced world that we have become? Would He still love us unconditionally? Nay to the first question and aye to the second. Father Girzone writes a nice little parable with plenty of thought-provoking speeches from Joshua. The movie version was good too but it left out alot of events from the book and made up others. Still the book and DVD are inspiring."
2,insomnia cure,"I am a Christian and liked the message very much, but I don't see why the author had to take a novel to deliver his message in the way that he did: Joshua ate, worked with wood, slept, ate, worked with wood, slept...too much of the story was taken up with all of that. It was extremely slow moving, and not in a good way-giving the reader nothing to eat up and think about-just banging one on the head with the same message that was refreshing at first, but quickly wore out."
2,"Valuable message, but a bit clunky","Anyone interested in cultural values and how religion influences them could get something out of the the book. The story itself is interesting enough, but I found the overall script of the book to be a touch dull and too convenient. As other reviewers have pointed out, we don't learn about the title character through his actions or his relationships. Instead, we read his monologues, which are cast as windy, repetitive responses to unlikely questions. In essence, Joshua is more of a preacher than a servant, and the book reads like a collection of sermons."
1,"an anti-Catholic book written by a ""priest""","The Roman Catholic priests in Father Girzone's ""Joshua"" are arrogant, phony, inflexible, fat, balding, alcoholic, cynical, manipulative or doddering. Perhaps Father would be happier with Holy Mother Church if she didn't ordain priests until they had been canonized. Joshua babbles several times about an ill-defined freedom as God's wish for us, but Scripture teaches that our loving Father in heaven expects obedience (remember Adam and Eve?). It's no surprise that ""Joshua"" is popular among non-Catholic Americans: they get to have the lies they've heard about priests and Church leadership ""confirmed"" by a priest. Shame on you, Father G. And the rest of you, don't waste your time on ""Joshua"", it's a lie."
5,Filled with the Peace and Love that we were meant to show!,"I am currently reading the third book in this series and I can't get enough. I think they are wonderful stories that show how good life could be if we all learned to Love as Joshua/Jesus does. Never has a book filled me with such peace. In my opinion ""The Joshua Series"" it is a must read."
4,over all good,i though that the book wasn't very well edited and could be offensive to some readers because it critisizes the church very much.
5,Joshua and the Shephard,"I accidently came across the movie Joshua on TV a couple of weeks ago and this was the first time I had heard of the Joshua Books by Joseph Girzone. I have just compelted Joshua and the Shephard and I must say this should be required reading for every Bishhop, Arch-Bishop and Cardinal in the United States. I absolutely love how this man writes and his ideas are not on the edge but rather Christ like. That is what our Catholic Church has gotten away from, being Christ Like. Joseph Girzone brings us back to our roots!"
3,Check your sources!!,"Mr. Will Durst is misquoted; not only are there words different than the actual joke he tells, he is NOT a Canadian writer!! He is a native of Milwaukee, Wisconsin."
4,Young Billy Young,"This is one of the last great westerns. I was part of management of Old Tucson Studios when they came to make this movie. I did all their locations,etc. This was before the big fire at Old Tucson in 1995 when 2/3 was destroyed, including the sound stage. The actors were great and it had a good pace. You will enjoy this great western. The don't make many anymore. Too bad."
5,Strongly recommended.,"I am in the process of studying for Part I of the Psychiatry Boards and bought this book. I was particularly interested in boning up on Neurology. Turns out that the biggest chapter of this book (Chapter 14) is neurology. It also includes an appropriately measured section on each topic in Psychiatry. All of the questions have been appropriately challenging, the answers are appropriately explanatory, and overall the book has been very helpful in assessing my own areas of strength and weakness, and provided a very good spectrum of knowledge. I strongly recommend it."
5,Practically useful for Part I!,Succinct and thoughtfully designed with the information really useful for the study. A great book!
5,Solid Performer,"Our offices were wired by someone that really didn't know what they were doing. Most of the rooms have no phone jack and the idea of running cable for two offices was not very attractive. The GE Edge 5901EE3 set was the perfect solution. We have voicemail on the line and a nice digital answering machine with multiple inboxes that handle our messages just fine. All too many of the 5.8ghz setups come with an answering system build into the base unit. That was something I definitely did not want or need. The GE Edge system is perfect. Clear sound, three units, no answering machine, handles standard 2.5mm jacks for headsets, each handset has built in speaker phone, ringer can be turned off, calls can be transferred to another handset, etc., etc., etc. Great deal too - got the 3 phones for $29.99!"
1,Worst phone ever...,"This proved to be the single worst phone I have ever used. The phone always sounded muffled and I had multiple complaints of echoes from people with whom I was talking; additionally, when trying to dial, the phone would clear the numbers I had input (prior to hitting the ""Talk"" button) and remind me that I had no voicemail messages waiting. In addition, the phone would start sounding ""static-y"" if I wandered more than about 40 feet from the base. Finally, the phone would not allow me to pick up multiple handsets at one time - if I had to switch handsets, I would have to put the call on hold and ""transfer"" to another handset and it surely would not allow more than one person to talk at the same time."
1,poor sound quality,We purchased this set of phones several months ago and are now looking for another set. It is very difficult for the person on the other end to hear you when talking. I often have to call my husband back on his cell phone because I cannot understand him. One of the handsets just quit working. You could not answer incoming calls on it. I got so upset that I purposely threw it to the ground and broke it. Garbage. We have purchased several sets of phones over the past 8 months and just cannot find one that we are satisfied with.
2,"Decent sound quality, not user friendly at all! Avoid this set!","I purchased this phone when my multi-handset Panasonic phone was damaged during a cross country move. I should have went out an bought another Panasonic set becuase I never had any problems with it, but I figured I would give this GE unit a try since it was priced right.The only real positives about this phone is that is has decent sound quality, large easy to dial buttons, and feels comfortable in the hand.Now for the negatives. The worst problem is that you can not pick up more than one handset at a time. So if you're on one handset and someone else wants to join the call on another handset, they can't! On top of that, the Caller-ID feature is hard to use and hard to organize. All in all this just isn't a very user friendly phone. I would avoid it unless it is on a crazy sale."
1,Only better than nothing!!,"These phones were NOT a good purchase. I bought these because we can never find a cordless phone to answer, figured 3 are better than 1 but I was wrong. I still haven't figured out why if one is dead, they all are dead. There is not an indication of how much battery is left on the phone. If it goes dead, you must hang up all 3 phones in the main base cradle before any of them will work again. It is all confusing and I don't like something that is difficult to operate!!"
4,Now to find those wines,"I found this book to be very informative, and perhaps even more than that it made me want to find and try the wines from the wineries he writes about. Not easy to do here in the States, but luckily there's the internet and search engines! One great resource I found was an online Austrian wine specialty shop: www.winemonger.comPerfect complement for this book!"
3,poor quality,This was listed as NEW and it was actually a used book. That beside pretty good but very outdated information because it's an old print.
2,2nd one not so good,"This is the second Apex stove I have purchased. The 1st one lasted 15 years before the steel braided hose started leaking at the pump. Since it was cheaper to buy a new unit than replace the hose I purchased the Apex2. The 2 did not fair as well as the first one. The unit started leaking form the steel braided hose in the same place as the 1st, after 5 uses in a year. I do like the stove it has a good burn and I like the adjust-ability of the unit. The flame can be set on full blast or a very low simmer. The base can be adjsuted to be level on just about any surface and I never had to replace a generator on the 1st Apex and it got a lot of use. If it was not for the hose going bad so soon I would give this unit top billing, even with it's heavy weight. I may try to repair the 2, but I can't trust it anymore."
3,and american classic,Old Cooper is too wordy. It hard to imagine that a woodsman like Hawkeye would talk so much. But the storys are good and one does get some insight into life in the Northeast of America in the middle to late 1700s
4,I enjoyed it,It was a pleasure to read. It gave you a feel for the time in which it was written. A simple but hard time.
5,James F. Cooper Leatherstocking saga,"Better than any of the movies, better than most modern novels. This is the third time I have read this saga and enjoy more each time"
2,Good Idea; Still Beta Quality,"This is a practical little book concentrating on the vocabulary and grammer needed for basic encounters in a foreign country. The idea of a set of books advancing thru the same set of practical tourist and office conversation topics in ever greater depth is a good one. Unfortunately the publisher shipped the beta and there's still quite a bit needed for a finished product. First, someone needs to proofread and correct all the places where new German vocabulary is introduced without giving English equivalents. Next, to be useful for self study, it needs answers to the many reasonably good exercises. And glossaries, both German-English and English-German are a must for those of us who study on the run and and prefer to skip the extra dictionary. Finally, I'd prefer a workbook format with room to write answers, so I don't need to carry a separate notebook."
5,Best phrase book for the money,"This book covers all the tourist and travel basics, from greetings to directions, restaurants, travel, shopping, and more. No grammar lessons, just straightforward vocabulary and easy-to-understand sentences. Not exactly pocket-sized, but slim and easy to carry along, just in case!"
1,Don't Bother--REALLY,"This is a poor excuse for a beginners guide. Not enough explanations are given for the first 14 chapters and afterward, its still bad. Look for something else. I hear the Schaum's German Grammer guide is good for beginners."
3,AWESOME 3D Graphics,Great Video saw it at a pub in australia and want iti would love if it were available on DVD as it would run great and attract customers at my shopthis video lives up to its name and has you mesmerised for hours!
4,Fun story idea,I got this book to help my kids not be afraid of monsters under their beds. The book is a little long for my younger kids but my 7 year old is really enjoying reading it to the younger ones. It's a cute idea of a story though...and we don't have as many monsters at night either (not sure if it's a result of kids getting older or the story).
5,A childhood favorite,"Years ago my children and I actually met Robert L. Crowe in a small town school library and of course fell instantly in love with ""Clyde Monster."" I was so happy and amazed to find copies all these years later so I can share it with my grandchildren! A wonderful, surprising story, with a great message about facing fears and not jumping to conclusions and trying to see ""conflicts"" or worries from different perceptions."
3,depends what you are looking for,"Rubber rather thin, limp, and squishy but adequate protection and grip if that is what you need. Major problem for me is sizing --- I have small hands (about 6"" from wrist to middle finger tip) and neither skinny nor fat fingers and could have fit two of my thumbs in the thumb and the smallest size was still too big for my other fingers. So, depends on your finger size whether this will work for you or not."
3,"If you've never read Coupland before, don't start here.","I love Douglas Coupland, but this is just not one of his best. It's a fun, quick read, but it lacks the elegant twists and subtle social commentary in most of his other novels. The plot is outrageous at times, especially the ending. I also found some of the characters annoying (ie - Brian, Shw), but without the redeeming qualities his ""annoying"" characters usually have.But now that I've said all that, it was still a fun book and I enjoyed reading it. It was only disappointing because I know Coupland is capable of better."
4,Be serious.,"At first, I didn't like this at all. It was so ridiculous and in no way believable. Around page 90, I decided to let myself go and just roll with it. I thought, ""There is no possible way this could get any more ridiculous."" And, lo and behold, it did, to the point of being absurd. I read this for my book club and I'm almost positive I'm the only one who loved it. I've never read anything else by Coupland, so I don't know how this one ranks, but I do know that if you go into it an open mind and the ability to suspend reality, you will love it."
3,Arrested Development meets The Goonies directed by The Coen Bros.,"Just finished this book over two days of commuting and would recommend it. It's the only other book besides JPod that I've read of Coupland's and really admire his writing and imagination. He takes the real and twists it into the surreal so subtly and with such humor that you don't even notice. It's dark comedy along the lines of the Coen Brothers and this one in particular felt like Arrested Development meets The Goonies. It's light but not too light and I plan to read more Coupland in the future, for a nice break from heavy fiction now and then."
4,The Lighter Side of Dysfunctionality,"This novel tells the story of a dysfunctional Canadian clan that finds itself in Florida in 2001 to watch its only overachieving member take off as a member of the space shuttle crew. It's possible that one has never met a family quite as dysfunctional as the Drummonds. Their promblems include AIDS, liver cancer, suicidal depression, thalidomide-caused birth defects, baby-selling, adultery, illegal prescription drugs, just to name a few. You wouldnt' think that a book about this much tragedy is funny, but indeed it is. In fact, this book is very funny indeed. It's nearly impossible to explain the plot without spoilers, so suffice it to say that the novel jumps back and forth between the family's past and present, showing that they've always had issues. This is a great book for when you need something laugh-out-loud funny. Coupland has a tremendous gift for the bizarre and absurd. When you're done, you won't think your life is quite so strange after all."
2,Anticlimactic.,"This book could have been one of Coupland's best, however, the ending is so horrendous that you honestly feel the writer is mocking you for having read it in the first place. A thoroughly disappointing novel."
4,um... different...,"This was a great book to read, after the first 3 pages I felt myself being drawn into it, and I could see it happening, but I was drawn in anyways. Twisted little story with characters with a LOT of depth and kind of bizarre, but not to the point of over done, this was a fun and humorous read. While the characters are extreme in situation, they have a certain common feel, that you (or, at least I) can relate family with. The story is fast paced, humorous, and has some good points made about the world, well worth reading. The only issue I had with it was that it was kind of short, everything moves at a good pace and extra in it would probably destroy that, but you still want more."
2,It was an easy read...,"Well, I must say I picked the book up because of its bright color and seemingly interesting title. Yet even as I was lead into the book and the crazy lives of its inhabitants I found myself questioning my sanity for plunging deeper and deeper into the novel. It's an ok read if you have some time to kill- but other than that- its a bit too much B.S."
3,"Thick on ""story"" -- interesting to read before movie.","I have loved Coupland since I first started reading ""Gen X"". I eagerly await each new release, and in reading the hype on this book was suprised to discover that the film rights had been bought by Michael Stipe of REM's production company -- bad thing to know before reading the book. I found myself engrossed in each page, trying to figure out how it would translate to film. The thing that sets this book apart from the others is that there actually is a A + B = C kind of story. You get the build up, the climax, the surprise twists, and the unexpected ending. It's a little off the wall (everyone in this damn book, save 2-3 characters, are sick), but a unique and fun read. I'm still puzzled as to who will play Janet. Sissy Spacek? Glenn Close? Ellen Burnstyn? A puzzler indeed."
3,If you like DCoup then why not??,"I agree that it is not his best. (Personally I enjoyed microserfs the most of all his work) It's been a long time since girlfriend in a coma - I burned right thru this book quickly and enjoyed it. I totally related to and enjoyed his depiction of Florida.I was left hoping for more (the same way I felt about girlfriend) which is too bad, maybe I've set the bar too high when it comes to anything Coupland writes."
1,a BIG disappointment,"The book's characters feel artificial, the plot contrived, the ending ridiculous. Coupland's usual obsessions are trotted out in due order: disdain for pre-packaged culture, technophilia, contradictory character traits, and a wistful nostalgia for pop culture items. But saddled with too many characters, this book never gels. I found it hard to finish. Even quite boring at times. His former works (Gen X, Microserfs) are much better. I wish I'd read the negative reviews on Amazon a bit more closely before I shelled out cash for this dud."
4,I don't know why all the bad reviews,"I picked up this book hoping to fall asleep reading. Instead I was drawn in by page 3 and stayed up until I'd read most of it. The main character, in my opinion, is Janet, the mother. I think it's more or less in her voice, and that is why she is the most developed character.The book was very funny in an ""Oh no!"" kind of way. Sure, there are some outrageous stories and some things may seem unlikely to some people. They are lucky, I guess. I, for one, can really relate to the dysfunctional family and to a lot of the characters.But it isn't meant to be a character study or some huge philosophy assignment. It's meant to entertain you while you pass some time reading, and it does that just fine."
1,Unusual and not really reverting,"Why did I not like this messy book? And why did I waste my time plowing through it???? People who have Aids don't get cured when they share blood with a prostitute who has (....) 35,000 people with no protection and failed to get the disease. Everything about this book is stupid, stupid, stupid. The Parents are from Hell and the children are not far behind. How could anybody in the world like this??? How could a one handed female get to be an astronaut? Somebody set me straight!!!!!!!"
2,"If nothing else, this book is psychotic","In reading Girlfriend in a Coma it struck me that it was Coupland's attempt to find meaning in life. The ending of Girlfriend in a Coma was a disappointment and Coupland never seems to have recovered. All families are psychotic, but this book is so fanciful that it lacks the power to invoke feelings of reality. The power of Coupland's early books was in their ability for people to see themselves as GenX or as Microserfs (although this lacked something). All Families is three parts slapstick ridiculousness and one part hyperbolic soap opera family.Douglas, if you're reading this - keep looking for truth, because you have settled for mediocrity just like the characters in this book."
1,Very Disappointing Book From An Otherwise Great Author,"I was so completely disappointed with this terrible book. I loved Generation X, Life After God, Microserfs and Shampoo Planet and count them among my all-time favourite books, but this book is garbage. Truly. I could barely finish it, and I sold it to a used book store as soon as I plowed my way through it. The plot is stupid and absurd and I almost felt embarrassed for Coupland upon finishing it. I agree with many other reviews that Coupland's work has really gone downhill after Microserfs (ie. Girlfriend in a Coma, Miss Wyoming, and this piece of trash) but I sincerely hope readers will not judge all of his work based on this one stinker. I read that Quentin Tarantino has optioned the book, but I seriously doubt even he could make this story good."
5,One of Coupland's best,"I don't like all of Coupland's books, and as a matter of fact All Families Are Psychotic is probably the last one I truly enjoyed. The writing style is more traditional (and more enjoyable) than later books. I found the story and characters to be brilliant."
2,all families...,"i find that the newer douglas coupland novels are lacking thought compared to other douglas couland greats as ""life after god,"" ""microeserfs,"" and ""girlfriend in a coma."" coupland is a master of wit and culture, and with his two newer novels, thatys all you get. i find ""all families..."" to be dull, compared to his other works. perhaps its because i hold coupland so high. hes a terrific writter, and i do advise people who are not associated with his writting to check out a earlier novel before checking out this one. i think this novel is for fans only.xoxo"
3,Interesting and Provocative,"I enjoyed the book, but thought the reactions of some of the characters were not convincing. For example, as people become diagnosed as HIV-infected, it's all very friendly & philosophical like catching a cold, whereas in any family, never mind a psychotic one, I think there'd be more emotion."
1,Dreck. I'm disappointed.,"I continue to think of Microserfs as one of my favorite books, but since Girlfriend in a Coma, Coupland's pretty much left me behind. The handle he used to seem to have on the generation or whatever demographic of society isn't apparent anymore, and he just seems to be too interested in how many annoying coincidences he can tie together... truth is stranger than fiction? At least more interesting, sometimes. I really don't feel much sympathy for <i>any</i> of the characters in this book, and it is trying getting through the book. It's the same tired and too-hip-to-believe characters over and over. I think this book marks the end of my habit of buying Coupland books. It will be a travesty if a movie is made of this book instead of one of his books with more substance. Sorry to ramble..."
1,"You've GOT to be kidding! Hearts is the single edit, NOT the album length!",There isn't much more to say than that. I've been waiting for YEARS for this album to be released on CD to have the full length album version of Hearts--the single edit has been available on numerous CDs in the past. HOW do you issue the ALBUM and put the SINGLE edit on of the biggest track on here instead of the full length version???
1,rip-off sale,i bought track from an ad like this one on amazon. i thought i was going to get 12 pieces of track instead i got one piece of track. not happy.
5,I hit pay dirt!,"What I needed was a book to help me plan and plant a new perennial flower bed. I chose Clippings from Orene and hit pay dirt!The author named the Helleborus orientalis (Lenten Rose) a perfect perennial due to its hardiness. When the requirements she suggested matched my soil characteristics and exposure setting, I headed to my local garden center. I am thrilled with my newly planted bed and am looking forward to finding more ideas in this book.It is full of facts with a great index - yet written in a conversational style. Having Clippings from Orene on your book shelf is like having your own friendly Master Gardener to chat with and learn from."
5,"Excellent, accessible academic overview","I used this book for an undergraduate research paper. It provides a very thorough academic overview of the bias, prejudice, and stigma against obese individuals. The book is very interesting and accessible to the ordinary reader. Each chapter is written by different author(s), but the book is organized in a way that it reads well if read from start to finish. Whether you work in the obesity field or just know someone affected by this issue, you will learn a lot from this book both about the difficulties obese individuals have to deal with and about how people are so easily drawn into discriminating against others."
3,Not as it looks on the package,"This costume is really cool, but it doesn't look anything like the picture that comes with the product. I would guess that the costume pictured would be twice as expensive given the level of detail."
5,Gives encouragement at the same time it tells the truth.,"One of the first things people have to realize if they want a career with dogs is that they have to do it for the love they have of dogs. Few people get rich off this. A good living is definitely possible, but wealth beyond the dreams of avarice is rare if not impossible.But the intangible rewards, the licks from a puppy's tongue, the wag of his tail, the gratification of an owner, or the good work you've put into a piece of dog writing all work to give one more satisfaction than most people can claim to get from huge salaries.This is not a book to be missed by anyone considering working with dogs, or even the casual dog lover."
4,"This Book is Not the Best, But It's GOOD!","When you look at the cover of the book, you think that there will be really cool jobs like mountain-climbin, policew dog training and guide dog training. There actually isn't. You can pick a good job with this book, but the job won't be unique. It also only lists 18 jobs. Why give it a four? I'm planning to run a dog shelter when I get older and be an animal rights activist. That's why."
4,CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE!!!,I enjoyed the 'Fist'. It was one interesting book. Well written with great imagery. Nicholas knows how to put pictures in a readers head. A must read for sure! Can't wait for THE REFLECTION OF EVIL.
2,Disappointed with the language.,"I bought this book for our church library, but was disappointed with the plethora of four letter words. I think I am going to send it back. I can't help but compare his work with Frank Peretti's books and John Grisham's ""The Testament"". They write best seller without that kind of language. Perhaps if he eliminates the unsavory words, his next book may be a best seller."
2,The language to me was awful.,I bought the book thinking that it was like the series of Left Behind. What a dissapointment. The language was awful and as a Christian I could not ask any of my church members to read this book. It really surprised me for Nicholas is suppose to be a very devout Christian. The story was good but very biblical. Guess I expected more. He is a good writer just wish he wouldn't use that language.
1,SO DISGUSTING WITH FOUL/VULGAR/FILTHY LANGUAGE.,"I cannot believe how a Christian could read this book, the language is so terrible. I, myself, couldn't get through it as it just kept getting worse. The filthy language was totally unneccessary, as is all that type of talk, but to claim this book is a Christian book and read by the same folks that read any of ""The Left Behind"" series, I DON'T THINK SO. In fact, it is the DIRTIEST reading book I have brought into my home in years and one that could NOT be left lying around for children to see."
1,I'm thoroughly confused.,"I'm not sure if the other reviewers read the same book I did. The presentation (format and font) was terrible. Character development lacked. Confusing chain of events. I think it was a great idea for a novel, but it wasn't quite finished. The whole time I was reading I felt like I had been delivered a rough draft. I do not intend to discourage Mr. Nicholas, but I do hope he will sharpen his skills and broaden his vocabulary in his next novel."
3,SOME WILL BE OFFENDED.,"The Fist of God has a good plot and storyline, but a little thin on character development. It's a fast pace read and interesting, BUT some people are going to be offended by the VERY strong language. I suggest if you don't like books with four-letter words you might want to stay away from this one, OR wait until July for the clean copy. Regardless of the cussing, the message in the book was great."
1,"too predictable, too strange","Flat characters, predictable plot, strange (not in a good way) twists and turns, and a religious element that was ineffective and equally strange."
3,Hooked on Classics 4: Baroque,"This is my least favorite of the ""Hooked On Classics"" albums, but I have not yet heard ""Hooked On Classics -3"""
2,its not a good representation of this artist style of musica,i enjoy mr. toups very much its sad he was so poorly displayed on this recording!!!!!!!!
3,"Definantly NOT ""zydecajun""!","Sounds more like Eddy Money pop than any flavor of zydeco or cajun. Fairly listenable but definately not ""truth in advertising""."
3,Doxies Rule,What a sweet face on the front cover! Wish I could see the whole dog on the inside though. Love the doxie with his/her head down and repentive eyes. Nice coffee table book. Friends and family comment favorably. I have a loveable mini longhair choc dapple!
2,"Yes, the book is short but not long","I ordered this book after reading a SF Chronicle review of other works by Amanda Jones, who clearly loves dogs. I found the book a little lacking--it's a very short book with photos of the dachshunds of her friends. Two of the cutest photos are on the front and back covers of the book jacket and NOT reproduced in the book--another shortcoming. I was not overwhelmed by this book and would not have bought it if I had seen it in a bookstore and perused it. I own two mini dachshunds and thought this would be more clever--and two dogs long--in it's treatment of our beloved weiner dogs."
3,A gift book,This book served OK as a quick gift for owners of this type of dog; they are looking to add to their herd.
1,Dissapointed,"I wanted this to be a great book, but it wasnt.It was very hard to read. It did not flow smooth and I had to keep going back to get a better understanding.I really didn't learn anything new about Tiger from this book.The pictures were also of very poor quality.I would rather have read a Bio. of Ron Lipton who did the forward to this book."
3,Much better than I expected it to be.,"The Spellsinger series is not my favorite, but to give Foster credit, the quality of his writing is fairly consistent. If this had been an Anthony or a Chalker series, by the sixth book the story would have broken down completely.In this, the sixth book about the rock-n-roll singing wizard from another world, Foster maintains the level he set in the earlier books and creates an enjoyable read. Jon-Tom faces the biggest villain of all-- his own desire to go home.The plot is not perfect in the Time Of The Transferance. It meanders a bit more than it should. Foster really seems to forget the mission in some places and get caught up in cannibals and bad puns. Still, fans of Spellsinger should not be disappointed. As usual, people new to the series should begin at the beginning with Spellsinger and not here."
3,Cookbook with no concepts...,"The book is a cookbook of twisted based clients and servers, withalmost no material on twisted's core concepts (e.g., as noted in aprevious review, almost nothing about Zope3 interfaces.) Also verylittle use of object oriented ideas and visualizations (there isone interaction diagram in the book), even those central to twistedlike reactor. Also some of the more subtle issues important towriting real systems, like event loop bridges to GUI toolkits,multiple threads, or exception handling, are not covered. As acookbook it is useful in helping one get running examples goingquickly (somewhat like the online POE cookbook does for POE novices.)But a twisted fundamental concepts book still remains to be written."
2,Not for LEARNING Twisted,"When I first received this book, I saw that it was short and rejoiced. I usually never get through a 400 or 500 page programming book, because I get the early concepts, and then go off on a tangent, using the concepts in some way or another.This book disappointed me. It went through some of the concepts of Twisted without really going into the details about some of the best parts of Twisted. The concepts of deferreds and the reactor event loop were skimmed over too quickly, and I never felt like I knew enough to implement any sort of server in Twisted.There are better resources on the web to learn to develop with Twisted than this book provides."
3,"eh, could be better, could be worse","The book was a very basic introduction to twisted. For the most part it will really only benefit someone who is relatively new to Python and needs to perform some quick network programming.The tutorials described were good to get someone familiar with the syntax and to show the basic implementation of twisted, but more time is spent reading the book then it would take just to get the documentation and learn it hands on. Any programmer that has poured a few hours into researching code and documentation would feel that this book was a waste of time.So if you are new to Python and need to learn network programming this book should be able to point you in the right direction, but if you are an experienced programmer, just use the documentation on the website and donate some money to the maintainers instead."
1,Disappointing,"On the upside, this book is obviously written by someone who knows Twisted well, and shares the values of its developers.On the downside, one of those shared values seems to be ""documentation doesn't matter.""Twisted is well-known for being very poorly documented, forcing developers to regularly scan through mountains of abstracted source to find out what they need. I was hoping that this book would address that issue, by clearly documenting how and why Twisted works, what the different interfaces are, etc.Unfortunately, it doesn't; instead, it only leads you through a number of canned examples. As soon as you want to step outside of any of the capabilities that's covered in them, you're on your own."
1,"Wow, seriously flawed and outdated","I bought this book because I was having trouble making sense out of the Twisted on-line documentation. I'm really a book guy, anyway, and felt I needed ""The Book"" for Twisted. When the first page equivalent of ""Hello World"" blows up on Python 2.6 because of some obscure deprecation issue, you know you are in for real problems. It gets worse from there. I think this book was probably a great title years ago when the Twisted bits and Python bits were more in sync. This book is seriously outdated and in need a huge revision."
5,An excellent complete 7 piece bed in a bag set...great for guests.,"This set is very nice,for a ""large guest room with a king size matress""...The quality is good an is similar to their queen and full bed size sets. This set make an excellent holiday gift...and i highly recommend this set... thank you stewart l."
5,Great knives at a great price!,"I ordered these knives after hearing my boss rave about how sharp hers had stayed over the 10 years she had been using them, and I was not disappointed. These are the best knives I've ever owned! I ordered two additional sets of various kinds of Rada knives, and I love them all. I hand wash mine to make sure that the brushed handles don't discolor. If you're looking for a quality set of knives at a reasonable price, these are the ones for you. They're American made too!"
5,Great knives,These knives are very sharp and dishwasher safe. They come out of the dishwasher looking new. I would recommend these knives.
2,Good quality but...,"When folks were trying to cut their steaks, the tiny handles made it hard to get a normal grip. They cut okay. They're not state-of-the-art or anything. It's the thin handle that earned these knives two stars."
2,Like little baby knives,They are the tiniest knives I have ever seen - nearly an inch shorter than my old set. Knives are expensive - bite the bullet and buy good ones.
5,As advertised - quality made in America,"I bought these steak knives along with some other Rada knives as part of a Christmas gift for my daughter. I made her a knife block in the shape of the State of Alaska. These knives came quickly (I needed them to make the actual slots in the knife block) and were as advertised, made in America and of decent quality. The next time I need knives for myself I will without hesitation buy Rada"
5,knives,The absolute best knives. very sharp. I threw away all my other knives and have the complete set now.
4,4 out of 5 stars,Really nice. Only thing to watch out for is not to wash them in the dish washer. It will cause the aluminum handles to corrode to gray/black. Or it could just be our water around here.
4,Smaller Knives but good quality,I was a little surprised when I received these they were smaller than I expected but they are good quality and very sharp
5,amazing new band,"last september i saw in a small dutch town these amazing guys who call themselves one star hotel playing almost better songs than the great WILCO I bought the 2 cd 's they made and thince that time their music doesn't come out my head and cd player.If you like jayhakws,uncle tupelo,wilco richmond fontaine etc please try these friendly guys from philadelphia.Specially their GOOD MORNIING,WEST GORDON is great.Steve Yutsy-Burkey and Daryl Hirsch are the new Jayhawks combining the experimental aspects of WIlco with the strong music of The jayhawksPeople who love Wilco, the flaming lips, big star,neil young etc will love it.One star hotel 2003 and tyheir second cd good morning west gordon are released by srereofield/lucky dice records"
5,surprised,I was also at the Ford City event and also saw alot of talent.If you are a rock and roll guru then you would not like this type music but the energy and the show was great. The problem was mainly getting autographs and my own CD copy as what I could see.I would like to see the song ALL ABOUT THE CHILDREN releasedpersonally. The guitar actually had no purpose except to accompany one song...so why not have it there and who cares about what was played or not. Anyway cudos to the ones of you who find the same hot elements that most of the audience found from attending the great and differet type performance
1,This IS Island of The Aunts,"Whether it was a re-release, or the English version of the same story, this is the same book as Island of the Aunts. You can imagine my daughter's and my disappointment when, just after finishing Island of the Aunts, we opened this-- only to read, ver batim, the exact same opening words.I was not happy-- there WAS no description in Amazon.com of this book because it was used. (...)"
3,Island of the Aunts on cassette,"If this is truly Island of the Aunts, then it is a good story. Just beware that publishers like to rename and reissue books to see if they'll sell better."
5,AMAZING,Shipping was lighting fast. Have no complaints. So thankful I now have this movie on DVD to that I can share it with my daughters and everyone else that has never seen it.
3,Haven't watched this movie yet.... saw it on the Big screen and just thought we would like to enjoy it at home,Come on folks --- I'm tired of this kind of junk --- you need a way to simply say I like it or don't --- no need to write a book to justify why I like the item purchased......
2,Same cheap chinese item that everyone else sells,"I was hoping that this ""name brand"" part would have a sight glass on the top, like the OEM part does. No such luck. I would guess it will perform properly, but without the sight glass it is difficult to determine if your AC system is filled with the proper amount of refridgerant."
5,Fantastic watch,Fantastic watch and at a great price!!! So happy to now be a proud owner of a Michele watch :)
5,Victorinox 53916 Swill Card 12 function multi-tool,I love my swiss card! It's just what I expected. It replaces my old one that I used to death!
1,A Bad Review on a recent purchase,"I have an original book of the one that I ordered from Amazon. The original has my grandfathers name on page 547, and the name was ""Ross"". The book thAT WAS SENT TO ME HAD THE CORRECT COVER, THE CORRECT FIRST PAGE, AND THE REST OF THE BOOK CAME FROM ANOTHER YEAR. IT ONLY WENT UP TO PAGE # 548, AND THAT WAS THE ""y_z"" SECTION. tHE ORIGINAL BOOK HAS ""rOSS"" ON PAGE # 547. tHIS WAS IMPORTANT FOR ME TO HAVE THIS BOOK, AS i WANTED TO PASS IT DOWN TO GRANDCHILDREN, AND THE BOOK THAT THE FAMILY HAS IS IN MY BROTHER'S POSSESSION. i CAN SEND YOU A COPY OF WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE. SOMEONE TOOK THE COVER AND PUT THE GUTS FROM ANOTHER YEAR INSIDE THE 1926 COVER. IT'S A FRAUD. MAYBE THE SELLER HAD NO IDEA , BUT I DO."
5,Strength Training Anatomy Review,"As a person who is interested in strength training, and with an emphasis on wanting to accomplish my goals in a correct and systematic way, I found this book to be most informative. The diagrams showing the exact muscle groups that would be effected for each exercise were great. I particularly liked the explanation of each exercise with instruction on how to correctly perform each movement. I found this very useful since I want to not only be successful in my efforts, but I want also to avoid injury that would interrupt these efforts."
5,Excellent Intermediate Guide to Bodybuilding Exercises,"This book is an excellent resource for intermediate level bodybuilders. It contains gorgeous drawings of hundreds of exercies and variants for all muscle groups. Accompanying text explains how to do each one and what muscle groups or parts of muscles are emphasized. It's very useful if you need to learn how to diversify your workouts.The book is very focused (thankfully). It contains nothing about how to put together a good workout schedule, so it is not a good first resource for beginners. It also does not cover preparing for competitions, nutrition, or anything like that."
1,Major Disappointment,"Great illustrations, but the book is full of innaccuracies, perpetuating many of the myths of strength training.For example,there is an exercise showing how to work the ""inner pecs"" - something which is anatomically impossible, since you cannot contract only part of a muscle fiber.Also, he writes how different hand rotations affect different heads of the triceps during various pushdowns - also anatomically impossible, since the triceps attaches to the ulna not to the radius and is thus unaffected by arm pronation/supination (rotation of the forearm).These are only two of many inaccuracies!!Nice drawings, not much else!"
2,It's all about the PICTURES!!!,"I love this book because of it's pictures. It demonstrates which primary and secondary muscles are being workied during various exercises, which is pretty neat. Other than that, it isn't very useful. It doesn't provide good routines or workouts that best develop those very areas it demonstrates. Thus, it's not a good workout book, just a nice reference. It's nice to have, but not necessary. Buy it if you like pictures, but don't waste the money if you can only afford one book."
4,"i""m studieng body bulding trainer","i would like to by this book.my teacher got him here, a year before.yesterday i saw him,and i""d like to buy him too."
5,Strength Training Anatomy,"Excellent resource. Over the last 15years my sports experience includeds weight training, running, bicycling, skiing, yoga, pilates, motorcycling, dirt biking, kayaking. I've had the benefits of one-on-one training and coaching and I've read many books on these topics. I've suffered my share of injuries and learned even more about my body through physical therapy and chiropractic. It is surprising to me to have found a resource that at this point that can so quickly multiply my body knowledge. It is probably the most worthwhile fitness book I've ever purchased. The illustrations are the perfect compliment to dedicated personal training and professional coaching. I'm 36, and a very active woman and I know this book will pay major returns for me in channeling my efforts, and preventing future injury. Get it if you are serious about being fit and healthy."
5,See What You've Been Missing,"If you work out regularly, this book is for you. It shows whichexercises and which muscle groups you are presently missing, andleads you to a more symmetrical workout.After about 10 days, I have post-it notes on about 9-10 pages,and some really sore spots from working the groups that I nowfind I have been neglecting.This isn't like the other weightlifting books, or ""regime"" manuals; this is one you need, and won't regret buying, andit won't be gathering dust on the floor next to your workstation."
4,"Informative, Inspiring","Using a simple color-coded schema, Delavier combines sound anatomy with bodybuilding exercises to give a unique perspective that will improve your workouts and expand your mind as well as your muscle size. Even though the models for the illustrations have the bulky, engorged muscles that accompany chronic steroid supplementation, and are sometimes depicted in the ludicrous pin-striped, post-Flashdance thongwear popular in California gyms in the early 90s, the illustrations are amazing. The selective use of color makes anatomically relevant highlights leap out. For example, the reverse wrist curl comes to life as the humerus and extensor carpi radialis longus, extensor carpi radialis brevis, extensor digitorum, extensor digiti minimi, extensor ulnaris, ane extensor indicus all are labeled in the context of the lift, so you know exactly what muscles are working while you're doing the movement."
5,The most awaited book in the series...,"""Whither thou goest I will go, where thou lodgest, I will lodge. Thy people will be my people, thy gods my gods."" So Breanna says to John...at the alter! A wonderful, and much awaited novel in the series. ...This is a great Christian Fiction book for anyone to read. It is part of my favorite series, the ""Angel of Mercy"" series."
1,A First Draft Sorely in Need of Editing,"This is not nearly the quality of ""The Boy Who Cried Abba"" or of Manning's non-fiction work. The story has promise but appears to be a first draft in sorely need of editing. The story jumps from event to event with little connection or character development. Situations pop-up full-grown with no warning. The protagonist grows up in a couple paragraphs, becomes a famous artists in a sentence or two, falls in love and loses her in a few pages, goes blind in a couple sentences yet can read a telegram. Where ""The Boy Who Cried Abba"" was a fantasy well told, this just doesn't make much sense."
5,Great collection,I was glad to find a dvd collection like this one that has all these wonderful movies together in one.
5,Loved it,"It was nice to be able to buy what I wanted together. Being in blu-ray format made these movies even better,more detail."
4,Good movies,"I had seen the first two movies but had never seen the third one until now. They are decent movies at a good price, I recommend them and this seller."
4,Great Value,You get the whole set for $10 buck. very good value. I like the main title too. Nothing fancy. Just pop the disc in and the main manual comes up. The first and the third movies are the best. You can just skip the second one. The documentary is fun to watch too. But... the picture quality is very bad especially the first one. Shaded area is pitch black without any detail. Light area is over saturated. Horrible. And there is no subtitle. There are a lots of catch phrases in the movies. I do wish they have subtitle in case I don't get what they are saying.
1,Only one out of four is worth watching,"I feel like buying one movie for 20 bucks.The first one is fine but the rest of them disappoint me.I recommend buying only the first episode separated with a lower price than $20.Other than the movie itself, shipping was pretty satisfying me, delivered in 3 days."
3,as shown on TV,This Collection has no subtitles. Still a good price if you just want to watch the movie as it was shown on TV.
4,vampire flicks,"what more can i say. it's quentin tarantino after all. with his chopsuey approach to film making and directing, all films were never lacking in excitement and action. was pleased with my purchase of this collection."
4,Answered Questions,"This is a good book because it gets you thinking, gives you advise, and things to look forward to. I was glad to read this book for it made me feel better about myself and my dating and marriage finding skills. It had a lot of basic stuff but it is a good book every single adult should read."
4,Excellent starting point,"This book features high-quality, full-color pictures that will help you identify features that you are looking for in your log home. It also includes a introductory overview of log home building. Do not expect an explanation of the building process! This is not a construction/contracting manual or a technical plan book, instead it is an exceptional ""idea"" book. This is not the only log home book you will ever need, but it is one that will be very helpful during the beginning stages of planning a log home."
3,"Good ideas, but...","This is a good book with beautiful pictures and a few floor plans, but it seems more targeted for women who want to DECORATE a log home, or give their home a more rustic feel. If you are looking for many many floor plans just grab a log home magazine. They are more complete."
2,Lame if you are looking for floor plans,Stay away if you are looking for floor plans...I would have rather spent my money on three good magazines.
3,Not Really a Novel,"Somehow a novel that is too much like a biography is much more boring than a biography that is almost a novel. Artemisia falls into the former category-on the cover is printed ""a novel"", but what lies within the pages is not really a novel. Aretmisia is more like a very interesting biography. This is a shame, because it seems that Artemesia Gentileschi was a fascinating woman, who had many complex relationships with her father and lovers. Unfortunately, in ""Artemisia"" we only glimpse the story through the eyes of the omniscient historian narrator, and so never really feel close to any of the characters. Artemesia's story is interesting, but it is not portrayed in a compelling manner. While reading this book, I felt no emotion, nor did I feel transported to another time. I did learn much about the lives of painters in Italy, and I do not regret reading this fascinating book. ""Artemesia"" is an enjoyable read, as long as you know what to expect when you pick it up."
2,Check it out from the Library,"I agree with Masala1226: many of the chapters were quite boring. I think the author could have done a lot more with the story, especially some of the dialogue, which sometimes didn't seem to fit what was going on. I know she translated some of the original Italian, and because it took place hundreds of years ago that makes a difference, but still. I found it bland, and rushed through it just to get to the end, hoping it would get better, which is didn't. For someone who did so much research, she should have made it more interesting."
3,"Good story, but TOO much detail and fact","This is really, an excellent story about Artemisia, the first major female artist in Europe and it is made very clear that Alexandra LaPierre has done her research. Unfortunately though I found that many sections of the book almost put me to sleep with its endless descriptions of formal documents and exact dates. I understand why she wanted to write Artemisia in this format, though because of the never ending supply of facts it lacks a narrative spice to it."
1,An incredible disappointment,"When you cut out the endnotes, list of sources, photos and maps, this book is about 60 pages of text--maybe. Worse, Grant pads it with lengthy passages from other authors. When all is said and done, there is probably not 20 pages of original material in the book. Grant should have been ashamed to put his name on it. There is a story to be told here. Rome's third century--a period of chaos, warfare and near anarchy that almost brought the empire crashing down--would make for a fascinating study. This isn't it. Michael Grant is a distinguished classicist. Many of his works are excellent. But he's 85 years old, and perhaps it's time he considered retirement. A book like this proves he is clearly coasting on autopliot."
2,The Collapse of Michael Grant,"Throughout the majority of The Collapse and Recovery of the Roman Empire, Michael Grant makes a valiant effort to examine and interpret this short, but very significant time in history. His text is mainly very well supported, though many times supported by quotations taken from his other books! Though Grant's accounts are interesting and intriguing at times, a tighter conclusion of his thoughts would have definitely have tied the text together. Michael Grant's knowledge is vast, his perceptions are divine, but more should be expected from such a revered and experienced historical author. However, his book, despite its shortcomings, provides a solid foundation for understanding this weak period in Rome's history."
1,Not a Book at All!,"Wow - am I disappointed! I have become fascinated with the decline and ultimate collapse of the Roman Empire and was happy to find this slim volume by Michael Grant - whose past publications have been authoritative and readable - to tell me what happened and why. But this isn't a book at all. Its a collection of excerpts from Grant's and others' writings interspersed by brief comments by the ""author."" Worse the comments, like the multiple quotes on the same topic, are repetitive and lack critical insight. I checked this book out from the library; if I had bought it I would feel like sueing the author and publisher. What a sad end to a distinguihed career!"
5,Love's Abettor,"This film is a virtual dicotomy of two men in love. It portrays the likeness and intensity in the budding, building and final completion in this dicotomy of men's love. This shows the power of love, no matter the circumstances. This film ends in a Greek Tragedy where the physical union is broken, but the spiritual union remains forever. LOVE IS BUT A UNIVERSAL CONSTANT FOR MANKIND! NJMJr."
1,"Appalling, inexcusable animal abuse","The human elements of this movie are quite touching, but it contains the most appalling incidents of animal abuse I have ever seen. At least one very sweet dog and one rabbit are killed on camera for the enjoyment of the director and his audience. Other viewers clearly don't care, but I do.However inspiring this movie might have been otherwise, I strongly advise anyone who really cares about animals not to watch it. If you're the sort who can excuse animal abuse in the name of art or changing times (as others have done here), or if, like the director, you actually enjoy it, then by all means indulge yourself. But if, like me, you believe that animal abuse for entertainment was no less abominable and inexcusable 30 years ago (or 1000 years ago) than it is now, you should avoid this movie."
1,Hard to use,"It comes with a tiny instruction book that is very hard to read and follow which is a problem since the setup is not very intuitive. The manufacturer put a lot of effort into the outside packaging, but apparently didn't think that the instructions were that important. I guess the manufacturer was far more focused on sales than customer satisfaction.Also, when I put the outside sensor right next to the main unit the outside sensor says it is 4 degrees cooler than the inside temperature is."
1,Disappointing,"This book is almost identical to previous editions of the book. Although, I have not reviewed every single page, the book appears almost identical, page for page, to a previous edition that I already own. I thought that this updated version would provide updated photos. Sadly, I am disappointed with this version. A book that advertizes itself as an update should have substantive changes that make it different than previous versions, this book is almost a copy of a very old issue that my grandfather owned."
3,Very well written!,"Surrogate Child by Andrew Neiderman (author of The Devil's Advocate) was good. This is the second novel of his I've read (first being Child's Play). Based from the two novels, Andrew Neiderman doesn't seem to be a blood and guts type of writer. In both books, there have been mysterious behaviors, ominous undertones, and of course death and murder. The death however isn't written in a bloody,""John Saul"" manner. Surrogate Child had a lot of questionable behaviors and ""what if"" scenarios. I felt the writing and character develop was very good. I don't feel this book would be offensive to anyone who chose to read it. Nothing was graphic. There were a few scenes where I was questioning the character interaction thinking to myself, ""this isn't normal behavior"". All and all it was quite enjoyable."
4,...those were the days,"If you're into the whole 3rd wave ska thing this is definately a cd you should pick up (coming from a guy who sifted through just about every ska band {good and bad} from that time). Honestly, the first time I heard of this band was at their farewell show. Very good ska band from back in tha day. It's interesting to mention that one of the guys from Fishbone produced this album."
5,Serious description of a threat NOT mastered by the west,"If you don't have this book or have read it, you are simply not on top of the world of mine, countermine and counter-ambush. This book should be purchased en masse by the U.S. Army and made a standard student text at Combat Engineer School. Peter Stiff shows how the armies in the southern africa area SOLVED the land mine, automatic weapons fire ambush, and if we want to avoid learning the same lessons all over again at a high cost in destroyed lives, we should read and heed this book's ideas into our own Army. This is NOT being done as combat engineering concerns have been marginalized by armor/infantry branch officers dominating decision-making even though the LAND MINE is the biggest killer of our Soldiers since Vietnam."
5,And That's What's Up!,I am honored to be the first one to review this album. I'm suprised no one has done it yet! This CD is AWESOME. I don't listen to Classical much but when I do this is one of the albums I choose over all the rest. If you are in doubt I'm here to tell ya it's worth the low price:)
5,Hooked!,"This got me into classical music, what can I say??!! Full credit for introducing a lot of other people into classical music as well. I loved the fast beat, hey it was disco time! I slowly identified the pieces I liked, found out what they were and bought them. So today I have a small library of classical CD's and it's all because of Louis Clark who arranged and conducted the Royal Philharmonic."
5,Cute and Sassy!,"The shoes fit perfectly, and are as cute and sassy-looking as they appear online! The best part of all? Well-priced. Glad to have found the brand!"
4,600 recipes will help those going into the business,I liked the Espresso Quick Reference Guide better but they make a good team of books for those going into the espresso business.
1,BAD !,"600 recipies ... WHO NEEDS IT ? There is nothing said about the art of making a great espresso, a few useless pages in the begining and that's it. What about all the different types of coffee machines ( piston or pump ? ), the water, the milk ? In the little paragraph about milk, UHT milk used throughout Europe, the land of Espresso, is not even mentioned ... and yes you can make your own UHT milk. There are so many recipes that would make anyone SICK, the awful variations suggested were invented to fill in pages. A barista needs to know how to make good espresso and a few basic coffee drinks, no one needs a book suggesting Marshmellow in a rasberry flavored ... thing, topped with whip cream. Awful. Coffee lovers : avoid it."
3,The power of a good deed...,Howard gets turned into a goose after being rude to a witch. The only way he can return to his human form is to do three good deeds.Funny and easy to read.
3,A pretty good intro,This was the first book I read in this series. A good introduction. I can could tell from reading this book I enjoyed the writing style of the author. I am curently purchasing many more in this series.
3,If I had to do it over...,"If I had to do it over, I probably wouldn't have bought these guys. They're well made, look nice enough and all that. But I think the depth of the cup is bigger than a lot of cup pulls out there--they look maybe a wee bit large on my cabinets. Another disappointing feature is that these need to be counter-sunk, which means quite a bit more annoying work than the average pull, and it also completely obliterates any chances of moving the handles for any reason after you make your drill holes, as they are pretty large holes.With all that said, these are indeed good quality cup pulls, well made, and attractive. For me, though, the devil is in the details. I feel I should have gone for a smaller-profiled Amerock (or other brand) from Lowes or Home Depot. Would've gone a lot faster and been a lot easier, and probably would've been cheaper too."
2,banged up,"These are nice and I was looking forward to putting them on my new cabinets (drawers). However, the very first one I opened (from the plastic bag) had lots of scrapes and small dents in it. Apparently scratches from being bounced around with the other pulls in the box... Disappointed -- I will not put scraped up hardware on brand new cabinets. But if not scraped up, I'd be very satisfied. I guess I will try to open up the others -- you can't see scratches through the plastic bag.."
4,Look and Function Beautifully,These pulls are great an look beautiful. Plenty of room for your fingers behind the cup and for the price they feel very substantial once installed. You can't beat the style for the price.The only downside is they are difficult to install. The have pin sets that need to be drilled out in the cabinet door before screwing them into place. This leaves you with little to no room for error when setting them level. I wish they were flat backed which gives you a bit more room to work with when installing.Other than a more than average difficult installation they are amazing pulls for the price.
5,Drawer Pull Amerock BP53010-G10,We're very pleased with these pulls and the price was great! Delivery was fast and I would not hesitate to go through Amazon again!
2,Disappointing,"Given Lucie-Smith's vast experience in the field, I expected a more definitive work on the male figure in the history of art. I found it to be much short of that. The scholarship and the illustrations just don't measure up to anything like a seminal statement on the subject. In fact, there are many instances when the choice of illustrations is inexplicable. This is not a book that I have kept for my art library."
1,Poker game is too small,It looks large than it really is. For the price an older person definitely needs a magnifier to see it and also is unable to hold it steady.
4,Cobalt Blade,"This is the first B Daman.So let's start off with something you all don't know. Cobalt Blade comes with an accessory (as does every B Daman) that increases it's power. There is a spring on the B Daman the increases strength, simillar to the Beyblade Spring Shooter.So is this B Daman worth it? It has great power, however it's Zero 2 counterpart (if you look at the stickers it says Zero, in Japan they have two sets, Zero [B Daman] and Zero 2 [B Daman Fire Spirits]) is much more better. If I were you I'd head to [...](there is an ad for it on this website, it's totally safe there) and purchase Cobalt Saber.Well hope I helped, if just a little."
4,how cool is this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this b-daman is da bomb!even though at first i thought it sucked but this is da best b-daman for people who like to customize like me. my first b-daman was chrome zepher but i regret getting him first cuz i like to customize. i wonder how good cobalt saber will be or chrome raven. i got chrome zepher first cuz that in beyblade dragoon sucks so i decide to get da second main characters b-daman. but now i see i was wrong.
3,I'M FUGGIN MAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I went to Toys R us the other day I got hella mad at the fact of you can't find Lightning Kahn or any of the old ones. IT FRIGGIN SUCKS GODDAMN!!!!!!!! Lightning Kahn owns and I can't even find it anymore frick!!!!!!By the way right larger reviews other than dis is the best b-daman evar!!!!!! And how the hell do you fin dlightning kahn in this website!! It used to be here. Man B-daman gets suckier with each new one gosh damn you hasbro!!!!!!! Why can't American stuff be as cool and good as stuff in Japan !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,I dont get it?,"I havent bought a bdamon yet, but from all the reviews i've read i'll probably buy Chrome Zephyr. I'm still deciding. I know you are not supposed to ask questions about things here, but i was just wondering, whats the difference between a DHB figure and a basic figure. Is a DHB figure for playing with and is a Basic figure just an action figure? I'm confused."
3,A lot of Chekhov is here - but a lot ain't!,"Basically I picked this book up hoping that it would have the hard-to-find play, ""Wild Honey,"" the closest Chekhov ever came to being Noel Coward. Not here! Ivanov - not here! The Bear - Not Here! While the essays are here and several insightful writings - to call this book ""THE PLAYS"" is an utter falsehood, not when there is so much missing."
5,The best movie ever,I'm always surprised when I hear someone say they've never seen this movie. It is our family's all time favorite movie. All the characters are funny. Kurt Russell is hysterical. I love the dance scene between Captain Ron and Katherine. It's one of those movies that we watch over and over.
4,Best bet,"I highly recommend the Isacc Asimov presents Super Quiz, it arrived on time and in very good used condition. The price is right. Winter Ventures gets an A from me.The other book that I ordered is called ""The Best of Isaac Asimov presents Super Quiz"" is the same book, but printed in smaller font. It is also more expensive, certainly not any better than the first one. I thought it would be a different version of the material. Save your money, buy the less expensive book."
3,TMI - HEAVY CLUNKY BOOK THAT IS HARD TO FOLLOW,I had to buy this book for a class & I hated it!Don't bother!~
3,"Good book, lots of info but, what is exceeding?","This is a great book, i would give it a 5 out of 5 but i dont like one thing in this book and it is that some of the ""tips"" in here are just to obvious or simple and some of them you would probably never use. the way i see some of the tips in this book is like it would almost tell you how to change the hue of a simple photo or how to change the contrast of a photo. It's a great book but if they would only put some more challenging tips i would give it a 5 out of a 5. :)"
3,"Pictures small, alot of tech writing",Book more for an architect and a historian then for a person who wants to enjoy and have fun looking at full scale color pictures.I'd like to see this book done over with only caption writing and full size pictures. Too much info.
1,Poor Tape Quality,"The story was excellent, but the tape quality was awful. It appeared as if someone taped it at home on their VCR in ELP. I was beginning to think it was bootlegged."
3,overpriced,I feel like i got ripped off! I paid $57 & there was only 2 episodes on that disc. If u ask me that's bulls***!!!
1,Poor Tape Quality,"The story was excellent, but the tape quality was awful. It looked like somebody taped it at home off their VCR. I was beginning to think it was bootlegged."
5,Great view into the daily lives of Native Americans,"One of my favorite history books. Exciting, true life accounts of life among American Indians from the 1600's thru the 1800's. The customs and challanges of life in the wild are revealed in the stories of a number of captives who live to tell about it."
5,"This could be me, eyes wide open now",Excellent video that I think every married couple should watch now before it's too late and every engaged couple should watch before getting married and then every year on their anniversary.
1,watta heck?!!,"Again I could give a better review if i got the item, but due to bad customer service from both seller and amazon.com this will be my last purchase on this site.hana"
2,100% Religious Preaching; 0% Entertainment,"The title of this review says it all; if you are expecting a drama, then know that this is religious preaching. If you're expecting religious preaching, then that is what you will get with this movie."
1,Fireproof,"received 2 DVD's that did not work, I beleive these were remake copies. At this time I have requested and am waiting for my full refund."
5,Moving,"This is a must see for any couple either married or engaged. It shows how you ""get what you give"" and can be applied not only in marriage, but in everyday life. A+"
5,Excellent Movie,"While the acting can be a bit cheesy, the message is very moving. A must watch for today's youth, who grow to have less and less respect for marriage and family."
4,Very good in a corrupt world,"I watched this movie and felt it was great in some aspects and cheezy in others. The moral value is top notch. It does not shy away from Christian values in family and marriage. They aren't afraid to portray conflict in family. The resolution at the end was very moving. I have had my share of hard times in my marriage, and this movie spoke to me effectively in this manner.Compared to many movies coming out of hollywood, this one is not superb as far as special effects, writing, and other items like acting. The acting is cheezy at times, and the dialog can be unnatural. However, the moral quality is far above anything that hollywood would dare to produce.This movie is not a five star overall, but I do give 5 stars for moral quality, and 4 stars for production.It is a ""go see it"" kind of movie.D~"
5,For better or for Worse,"At first when i seen the beginning of this movie i thought. Kind of on the corney side but then as you get more into the movie and start to really take a good ""inside"" look and put yourself in that situation, you can truly relate to it. Because in reality and truth a marriage can become a shouting match,and not hearing anything your spouse has to say especially when anger takes over, not to mention we are selfish to our own needs and desires. I find this movie is very teachable and related to my circumstances.I was intrigue about the Love Dare Book it is hard to give in to please your spousebut in the long run it pays off if you give it to God and leave it in his hands. I encourage you to buy this movie or buy it for someone who is going through the fire."
3,A little over rated,"I think my family enjoyed ""Courageous"" more. This cost a little more to view so I don't think it was worth the extra $."
4,Kirk does it again,"I enjoyed the movie. It was troubling for me to watch such hate and disgust occur between the two main characters. However, that is 'real life'."
3,o.......k......,well my biggest problem with the movie was my grandpa is a fireman and buys fire moves hint the name fireproof. it wasnt even about that like ladder 49 or backdraft. but overall the movie was good
4,Great Message for all couples!,"The acting wasnt the best in this movie but I still loved it because the message was one ALL married couples could learn from. Even if your marriage is in great shape, this movie can help you learn to keep it that way!"
5,Awesome Movie,"This movie was awesome, a great message. I would reccomend buying this movie with the the love dare book as a gift or for yourself."
5,Skillful use of resources. Great plot,"This film is good evidence that a strong plot/ storyline can overcome a low budget-- which is not easy to go. (Consider that ""Revolutionary Road"" with Leonardo Dicaprio had top flight stars but no plot.) And this film was definitely low budget.Kirk Cameron is a devout Christian and it must also have been challenging for him to play the role of a doubter.Many of the actors obviously were not professionals. But that didn't really detract from the film. Moreover, there were strenous effort to make sure that the cast was very racially diverse (this was daring in itself).I've also seen many divorce/ end of the relationship films, and this one was definitely better than most. So, it is worth a rental no matter what your religious beliefs are."
3,Could be better,"If you want a good clean form of entertainment with no cursing, nudity, or violence then this qualifies. I appreciate this film for those reasons and will keep it in my collection.However, the acting is terrible. I know this was a low budget film but couldn't they have hired people who can act? I can deal with the soundtrack, the sets, and the quality of the filming...BUT please hire people who can act!I know people are upset with negative reviews but please let's be real. I didn't see this movie thinking it was going to have some life altering message. I just wanted to be entertained without being offended. On the basis of just being entertained this movie needed some work. I wasn't offended...well maybe I was offended by the acting... look the movie needs some improvements. So, stop thinking that anyone who gives it a bad review must be a pagan. People just know bad acting when they see it."
5,MUST!!!,"This is a must movie, this is one of my favorite of all times movie that I have ever seen in my life!Anyone who is anyone needs to see this movie! I don't care if you 0 years old or 1000 years old, this is a must for any human!"
2,2 stars and thats generous!,"Before someone flames me I am a Christian, but this was a 2 hour movie that could have explained its plot in 5 minutes.He left one partner (his spouse) to be a workaholic! Simple as that!How someone can stretch that for 2 hours beats me!But I guess if its a Christian movie, and its about stopping a divorce we are all supposed to clap and cheer and rave about it.No this guy, sorry.I could suggest better movies, Facing the Giants - Excellent, 5 starsFlywheel - could be better, but 4 starsFaith like Potatoes - great true story 4 1/2"
5,Helpful,It will help you get back on track. Anyone trying to save their marriage should read this book or watch the movie together
5,Must See!,"My husband & I just finished the movie and we both totally loved it! Yeah, we were both in tears at the end! First movie I've ever seen that focuses on real life struggles of marriage. Any married couple can relate to this film one way or another. Had to rush to my computer to purchase ASAP!!"
5,I am a divorce lawyer,I have been a lawyer for over 26 years. After seeing this movie I am now giving it to all clients who come to see me for a divorce hoping they will not go through with it.
5,Outstanding film.,It is to easy to jump out of the frying pan and into the fire. We can see how we can be decieved by another person when we are vulnerable. We saw that if we stick with our spouse God can do a miracle. Trust in the Lord and watch what he can do in marriage.
3,OK Movie,This movie was way over-rated. It was ok but I wouldn't watch it again. Most people say it was good to watch with your spouse..... Pure torture for most men if you do this.
2,fireproof,Not happy with this movie. There is a place near the end that the movie stops. You have to go the the main menu and go to sene selection. I need to contact the seller but have not done that yet
5,Wonderful message.,"I watched this with my daughter and I didn't have to worry about inappropriate content or cursing, and it had such a positive message."
4,I really the movie,I would suggest that people who are considering divorce should watch this movie. It will help most relationships. It helped mine.
5,Wholesome!,Wholesome movie! It's not everyday that a good movie comes - WELCOME TO THE NEW NORMAL what a statement. Great!
3,I have the DVD because it was free,"I saw this movie in the theatre with a group of people from my church. At the time I enjoyed it very much, because it addressed issues that so many people struggle with, in a thoughtful and Biblical manner. It also had a few funny moments, and a good overall message.However, I cannot discount a lot of the truly bad acting in this movie, most notably Kirk Cameron's dad, the woman who played Catherine, and ESPECIALLY ESPECIALLY that doctor whom she ends up having an affair with. They were supposed to be having a steamy affair, but there was acsolutely ZERO chemistry between them whatsoever, and the whole thing just seemed contrived. Catherine just ended up being annoying to me. That doctor is probably the worst actor I have ever seen in a movie.I own the DVD, simply because it was given to me, and I do enjoy it from time to time, but the horrible acting from many of the characters really takes away from the effect of this movie."
5,excellent watch!!,"This movie is excellent it really is good for married couples or couples on the brink of divorce as in the movie, Kirk cameron played a very good role as did the lady that plays his wife."
5,Very Satisfied With Purchase,I was very satisfied with the purchase. It was in excellent condition and was recieved early.
1,Worst Movie Ever!!!!!,"Talk about christian fundamentalist propaganda. Horrible plot, laughable acting, and Kirk. I'm embarrassed for anyone who had any part of making this film. Jesus would be offended with this movie. I do love that chic-fil-A was a make up treat. Nothing better than Gods deep fried chicken to patch up a marriage."
1,"""but it has a great message""","My wife and I kept hearing about how great this movie was, and how we would love it. This is just my opinion, but I though it was very poorly written, and the directing was so bad it was comical at times. Yet I continued to hear people drone on about what a wonderful movie it was. If I ever mentioned anything less than glowing praise for it, someone always said ""but it has a great message."" Perhaps, but it's entertainment value was poor. Want a good message? Then get this movie. Want to enjoying watching a movie? Find something else."
1,A movie starring turds for turds,"Bad acting, Christian propaganda, trash movie.......I was duped into buying this garbage of a movie at the behest of a friend who knows that I'm atheist. Bad joke. Anyway, atheist or not I can enjoy a good movie regardless of its content. The Ten Commandments is one of my all time favorite movies. Fireproof on the other hand is littered with bad acting, and its plot is as predictable as can be. To sum it up: Homeboy Kirk Cameron's character cannot save his marriage unless he turns Christian. It's a shame Kirk Cameron didn't stay a comedic actor because he sucks when tries his hand at serious acting.......Bad acting, Christian propaganda, trash movie!!!!"
5,A Wonderful Film!,"We need more films like this! It has an excellent message that will stick with you long after you've seen it! I can't say enough good about this film!I watched it in the theater and loved it! So I had to get the DVD!The quality of this movie is really good. It has suspense, action, humor, and most important, a good moral story that has a purpose.Kirk Cameron does a flawless performance as Capt. Caleb Holt, the firefighter who is struggling to find peace in his marriage. The rest of the cast does an excellent performance as well.This film is a testament to what God can do with a group of people who are committed to obeying his will in every step of the way!Our culture has drifted so far away from the truth that we no longer have the answers for life. May this film be used as a wake up call to America!"
4,Fire Proof,I bought this because it was said that all couples should see this. I truly agree. Marriage is for life and you need to give it your all before you give up. I yelled at both the actors to just stop but in the end I was happy.
1,"lame, bad acting, one sided","oh my goodness.....what an awful movie, some of the worst acting i have EVER seen.why is everyone saying how wonderful it is - are they blind?, deaf? - im sorry but the whole movie was incredibly one sided, the woman was saying how awful the man was, and how she needed to forgive him - when she is running around with another man, and is so totally self centered. my husband and i were recommended to watch this by our marriage counsellor, but really is is a load of codswallop, a truly ghastly movie."
5,Fireproof,This was a wonderful movie. I recommend it for all married couples and those who plan to marry. I will share this movie with many people. Lea
3,Sweet and Religious,"I knew this movie would have a religious theme, but I found itheavy-handed and preachy. I enjoyed it, but kept myself in check asfar as judging the overplayed message. However if I had friends whosemarriage was in trouble and they had religious leanings, I'd purchace thismovie for them immediately."
5,The proof is on fire,"So like most abducted children of Japanese ancestry I was shocked and amazed by this movie. Sometimes the proof isn't in the fire, but it's under the bed, a snippet of hair, an old shoe, a map, blood, dna...but sometimes the proof is that when we don't have answers maybe there are no questions. And when we have question's who's asking them? Is it Detective Waters who missed a clue which kept me under a barn for ten years, or was it his partner who died twelve weeks prior to the wrap of this movie. See we never want to believe things happen for a reason, but then a movie comes around and says hey remember when you were asking yourself why? I got your why right here. Knuckle sandwhich to the face!"
5,Excellent,This movie is well worth a person's time. It makes one think about the words you say and the actions or reactions of your life.
5,investment,"fireproof is great for all couples.. can relate to both characters...not just movie but a guide, a mirror for anyone...."
5,Great anniversary gift.,"My husband and I watch this on our anniversary and I give it away to newlyweds and tell them to watch it on their first anniversary. As many times as I've seen it, I still cry at the end...so touching."
4,watch this movie,A little after school special like but the message is priceless. Do yourself a favor and watch it. Marriage good or bad... watch it anyway
2,Don't Believe the Hype,"I wanted to add an ACTUAL review of the film and NOT a review of its Christian aspects. From an entertainment standpoint, this is a very below-average film that will unintentionally make you laugh. The production values are ""straight-to-video"" quality, the acting is laughable, and the script is ripped right out of a bad Lifetime movie.It appears that Dr. Dobson and his ""Focus on the Family"" must have a ""get out the vote"" agenda for positive reviews of this film. Don't get me wrong... I have no problem with the themes of this film, I just don't want people thinking this is the best film since Citizen Kane, as the overwhelming number of 5* reviews would have you think. A GOOD message does not make a good movie, and this is by no means even a mediocre movie."
1,Bad acting and too religious,"This movie has the worst acting, stereotypes, and a hard religious angle that you don't see till about 30 min in. I thought that at least the storyline would be decent even if the acting is bad....wrong. Kirk Cameron is a horrible actor, but look decent next too all of these people that wouldn't make my 7th grade play. I couldn't even finish the movie before I had to write this review and I will not....45min 43sec is all I can take."
1,Revelation,"Watching this movie reminded me why Kirk Cameron has not worked in about 15 years. His acting is simply horrible. I couldn't tell if it was the writing or the directing or simply his overall lack of ability but this may have been the worst movie of 2008/9. I totally get that the ultra-right wing evangelical viewers want to pump up the rating so people will be duped into thinking it's good, or even tolerable but it's not. Save you self the pain and skip this flick."
4,Fireproof for this world and the next,"Fireproof may not be exacting, resplendent, or noteworthy by Hollywood standards, but the story is compelling and the actors seem real. A firefighter, as the lead character, is very symbolic for he pulls people to safety while his marriage desperately needs rescue. The story unfolds when he discovers the biblical solutions to bringing consideration, patience, and passion back to his marriage. The is Christian and dominantly bible-based. I really enjoyed this flick and recommend it to all those who are married and those who desire to marry some day."
5,Very pleased,The item was shipped and delivered on time and was in the condition promissed. Very pleased with purchase and with seller.
3,"Awsome story, bad acting and visuals","I am a Christian and married and this movie was great and opened my mind up on how to work more positive on my marriage. Watching Kirks charactor grow and save his marriage was an awsome journey.The other actors where horrible and made it hard to believe their situations. the effects where almost as bad. but if you can get past those and enjoy the movie for what it is teaching that is main point.3 stars for the story, very strongminus 1 star for the horrible actingminus 1 star for the poor visuals"
5,Matthew Johns,Awesome movie! I was very happy with this movie. It met and exceeded my expectations. I would highly recommend buying it. It shows good family values.
4,"New Era of ""Christian"" movies","This movie is one of the first one for a new Era of Christian film making. Well done, this is definitely raising the bar for quality and entertainment. In my opinion I did not give it 5 stars because it seems to try a bit too hard to make it an evangelistic tool. Next time use a true story and will totally qualify."
5,Fantastic Movie!,"This is a great movie that inspires couples to make Christ the keystone in their relationship in a world that emphasizes that the only important thing is finding an illusive ""happiness"" that has the potential to draw one partner to leave the other behind. My husband and I saw this movie in the theater right before we were married in June 2009. When we heard the song ""Love is Not a Fight"" by Warren Barfield on the soundtrack, we knew it was going to be our song. It is the song we danced to at our wedding that continues to encourage us everyday in our marriage. Order it!"
5,Excellent movie with a redeeming message,I highly recommend this movie to anyone whose marriage is struggling and to the general population. It is filled with biblical truths on how to relate to your spouse. It is very well done and also entertaining and moving.
4,Fireproof,"The DVD ""Fireproof"" was quite new and untouched. It has increased my confidence in Amazon market."
5,Marriage Helper,"My husband is a fireman. He used to feel as if the department wasn't able to operate w/o him. Even a marriage counselor was little help, if any.One day something happened & he decided his family was more important.He is currently is on an emergency fire department. This is part of his regular job. His attitute is 100% better."
3,Surprisintly Decent,"I'm one of those Christians who doesn't wear his faith on his sleeve, and have always found such concepts as ""Christian Rock"" and ""Christian Films"" to be rather silly.But it's only because they usually earned their reputation.Not so with some of the recent Kirk Cameron flicks. Don't get me wrong. The technical production is often low-grade, and in some cases (the Left Behind films) the plot is a bit hokey.But Fireproof seems to mark an evolution in the Christian film genre. One critic of the film has accused the film's message of being overly simplistic: find Jesus and your marriage problems are over.Not exactly.The husband's efforts to save his marriage are taxing and the road is long, and he even comes close to failure at one point. The point comes through loud and clear: marriage is work, whether you know Jesus or not.That's the most honest message about marriage in a film I've seen in a long time: ""It's not without its rewards, but it's work."""
5,An example for all of us!,Every marriage can be strengthened! This movie shows how important marriage is and that we can't give up on it no matter how futile it may seem.
5,Fireproof is totally AWESOME!!!!!!!!!,This is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my entire life. I highly recommend it to everyone!!!!!
5,excellently done,"The quality of this story and the emotions it brings out are excellent. The whole cast does a wonderful job of not only making this story believable, but brings out the difficulties of trying to cope, facing reality and taking responsibility. Very well done and I highly recommend it to anyone who may be looking for help making their marriage the best it can be."
5,Great DVD with a deap message!!,"Great DVD with a deap message!! And also very helpdul, if you are in trouuble in your marriage. There's a way out!!"
3,Great Story Line-Horrible Acting.,"The acting is certainly sub-par; however, the story line and moral are excellent. A great couples movie, if you don't mind a little cheese."
3,Great message badly put together,"This was a very well intentioned movie with a great message. But, I only stuck it out past the first five minutes since a friend recommended it because it was very poorly executed. I am mostly glad I did but it really was weak and badly done. The acting was so stilted, the characters were almost stereotypes and there was a depth that could have been brought to it that was ignored. It reminded me of an after-school special...great intentions poorly executed."
2,Its just funny,"You all got Kurt Cameroned on fireproof and can't admit it , Utter trash one realistic user said I must agree also there is a verity of Kurt Cameroned films with great Names and great covers that are real trash , Don't get kirk cameroned again read the description of the Movie ,"
1,I've seen better acting in a high school play,"I was willing to give this movie a chance because it was a Netflix recommendation based upon other movies that I have watched. I am a writer and have high standards for movies, I will admit. However, I could not get past the first five minutes of this movie. The acting was stilted, as if reading from a teleprompter, and some of the characters were caricatures. I am not sure if the fault lies with the writers, the actors, or both, but if you care at all about quality, you will run in the opposite direction from this movie. You can have a message movie with good acting and good writing, this is not one of them."
1,"Moral yes, Quality No.","This movie is poorly shot, terribly acted, with a sub par soundtrack. I grow increasingly tired of Christians giving high marks for poor quality products in the arts. I know we're starved for morality in the media and God will use what he wants to turn hearts, but let's demand excellence from ourselves. I couldn't stomach this movie after 30 minutes. Another embarrassment for the Christian community."
1,"Interesting, but an awful movie, and mildly offensive.","I watched this film because 2 of my roommates highly recommended it and said it was amazing, and also that it was a good chick flick. First of all, this is not a chick flick at all. This film is very much about christianity. The reason I say it is offensive is that the theme of the movie is that people cannot truly love one another unless they love the Christian God first. As someone who is not christian, and whose roommates worked so hard convincing me to watch it, that is a very negative (and false) message. Furthermore, the acting and script are just awful. For much of the movie the actors appear to be just reading cards and barely put any emotion in at all. Better acting would be found in a super hero movie, as well as a better love story."
5,Fireproof,"This is a really good movie, very timely. I am surprised to learn that this movie is made by a community, not Hollywood. It makes it even better when you know that the main couple is a real couple. The extras are very funny! A must see!"
4,If you want to save your relationship...watch this film,"My husband and I viewed this film after having a difficult time in our lives. Although the film is not a big budget Hollywood type movie, the premise of the film hits on every emotional level a couple can go through. Follow up with the Love Dare devotional. I tell this to all of my friends who are experiencing trouble in their marriages. The film and Love Dare book changed the course of our relationship in a very positive and long-lasting way!"
5,AWESOME,"This movie makes a strong and valid point about God,and our relationship with him and our spouses. I highly recommend this movie to everyone. This is about faith, family (especially marriage), work, and ourselves."
2,Movie w/o Book,"First, yet not all that important when considering the message of the film, the acting is TERRIBLE. The movie was recommended by a friend for the message and I bought it without reading/watching the trailer. Had I not been interested in only the message, I would have turned off this movie after the first 20 minutes. I was expecting the plot of a man finding his faith and was disappointed by a man overcoming selfish behaviour.I agree wholeheartedly with the message of this film, but you do not get the complete message without the book...SURPRISE...written by the same people who wrote the script. It makes me wonder if the Kindricks' intentions were to boost book sales by releasing a ""companion"" movie.That be said, unless you want to bolster Christian film sales, you may want to purchase the book and leave the movie on the shelf."
5,My favorite movie,"I loved this movie!I recall hearing a story, a long time ago, about an anguished man who went to a pastor friend for help. ""I feel like there is a dogfight going on inside me,"" he said. ""A good dog and a bad dog, fighting to the death. And I don't know which one will win.""""I know which one will win,"" said his pastor friend.""You do? Which one?"" asked the man.""The one you feed,"" replied the pastor.Most movies these days feed the bad dog. This movie feeds the good dog.What a breath of fresh air!"
5,Gives your Marriage/Relationship a whole new meaning <3,I watched this movie on TV today and it truly touched my heart. It's definitely a movie you might need to have a box of tissues besides you. It teaches you not to lose hope or give up not just in a marriage but in any aspect of your Life. I'm currently going through some Life difficulties and was ready to give up but after seeing this movie it renewed my strength and to not lose hope or give up. I am hoping to buy this DVD soon so that I can have it in my collection as a constant life line in times where I am ready to give up and losing hope in my Life.
5,muy bueno..buenisimo,Es una pelicula muy bonita con un mensaje muy bueno para los matrimonios...la recomiendo ampliamente...deja muy bonita ensenanza...Yolanda
5,Inspirational no matter what condition your marriage is in,"You don't need Hollywood to get a truly inspiring and life changing experience from this movie. It cuts to the heart of many marriages and gives hope, no matter what stage your relationship is in. It's not too late!"
5,Fireproof,"This movie is worth the viewing even if you are single or married. The message is profond, to give in to what you believe will help you though any problem that may arise in a marriage or a relationship."
3,believe in god,"I thought it would be more firemen things and not so much love show... so on that note I thought it was not that good of a show, for me. It was a very good show if you want lesson and God for the story line, which I didn't expect. Though it would of been a fine show if it had more firemen theme (meaning more action in firemen stuff), therefore my rateing was low for this show. Michael S."
1,So cheesy and stupid!!!!,"Who are you people that review here? Do you live in the bible belt? You must because serious religious people are the only ones that can tolerate this silly and extremely cheesy film.I'm shocked to see that not enough people have pointed out how horrible the lead actress was! I see now why they could not get a decent female actress to take on this role...it's a joke.It is hard to even see a relationship between the two main characters, it is hard to see how anybody can see this for more than 15 minutes to be true.Seriously...if you are not a deep devoted christian that listen to Christian rock and wear silly christian rings then I can promise you that you will HATE this film!!! AWFUL......just AWFUL!"
1,Just get divorced!,"Kirk Cameron is being ignorantly used as a tool of evil. there, i said it.and YES, i am a christian."
1,dont waste your time,"I was thinking this was going to be a good movie, It seemed so christian. It was so so so bad. I did not even fisish it! The whole 15 min. I watched it was just so SO Cheesy! GAG ME"
5,Don't miss this movie,"This is an excellent movie. It shows how a bad marriage can be saved, and an OK marriage can be improved with just a little effort."
2,It was O.K,"I had heard so many good things about this movie. I think it would be a good movie for realationships that are going through a rough spell but we didn't really get anything out of it. After serving over 5 years in Iraq between us, we cherish every moment we have together. But I would recommend it to people going through a rough spell in their realationship. Over all, it was ok"
5,Excellent purchase,"I purchased two copies of Fireproof and gave them as gifts to my married sons. They watched it with their respective spouses and later thanked me and commented that they really enjoyed watching it. I feel that every couple married for years or planning to wed, should see this movie. It was well done and the plot made it interesting to watch as it has some action and humor to keep both the guys and gals interested. The deeper meaning worked into the plot, is very effective. Excellent purchase for self or gift to a loved one."
5,Fireproof Review,I enjoyed the the movie because it truely strikes a cord of how allowing pride and selfishness into a relationship. A wise man once said that all the success in the world does not compensate for the failure at home; point made in the movie.
5,The Truth About Love,"Fireproof, the movie, Stars Kirk Cameron (of the Left Behind films) as Caleb, a firefighter whoose marriage is on the rocks. Given a copy of ""The Love Dare"" by his Father, Caleb attempts to rescue his marriage from near certain divorce and discovers something more (the truth about love, and God) in the process.While I was slightly put off at the beginning by the lower quality of acting, by the time the movie was over I was hooked. This one is definately a keeper!"
5,Wonderful!!,"As a firefighter's wife, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. My husband did as well. We have been married for 14 years and agree that we wish we could have seen this together many years ago as we were struggling through many of the same obstacles. Not just for those in public safety though. A fine movie for all, no matter what stage of life they are currently in."
5,Great,Great movie!! Highly recommended I can't watch it without crying great great great great great great great great great great
4,Good movie--Not Easily Broken is better,I really enjoyed Fireproof and thought it was moving and good. I had seen Not Easily Broken maybe 5 or 6 months earlier so it came to mind when watching Fireproof. I think Not Easily Broken is a better movie and has a better message as well.
5,Great relationship insight,"This is an effective portrayal of a relationship in crisis. The movie is applicable to any personal relationship: marriage, parent-child, sibling, friendship, etc. in which we come to take another for granted and focus on our own needs/feelings over another's. The viewer is left with hope for an improved relationship regardless of the other person's behavior and actions."
5,Great Flick,"Great movie whether you (man or woman alike) are in a relationship or married. It can also help you understand how to get along with people in general. We consider this to be a 'B rated' movie (acting-wise), but watch it (with NO interruptions), and take the meaning to heart with an open mind and it will blow you away! It has brought tears to macho men and be prepared for the surprise ending."
5,Perfect For Couples!,The DVD was shipped promptly and professionally [as promised] by the seller. The movie is a must-have for couples regardless of how long they have been together. The spiritual theme is perfect for the world we now live in.
4,Good movie,"This movie was well written and the story focuses on a faith based relationship with your spouse and having Christ as the center of your life and relationship. While I am not quite sure that 40 days would be enough time to rescue a sinking ship, it makes an inspiring story none the less."
3,It Could Be Worse,The message is good. You can only change your own behavior and love is a choice.I'm not sure how to rate the acting. I thought it was the dialogue that was awful and the storyline was a little ridiculous.
1,READ THE BOOK... AND SKIP THIS MOVIE,"My husband an I read the book and loved the message... so much we rented the movie. Bad idea. The acting in this movie was unbelievably awful. My husband actually wanted to turn the tv off after about 10 minutes (which we should have done) but we instead watched the whole movie. Do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie... just read the book and you will take away with it a wonderful message. If you watch the movie, the message is lost."
1,"Sad, twisted message that denies God's grace","Once again the popular but unscriptrual message ""God saves those who obey Him"" peeks through the edges of this condescending, demeaning and frivolous movie. Although it makes you WANT to like the movie because of its family values etc, the cheezy plot and weak acting can't be overcome.The movie actually reinforces the view that ""Men are stupid, insensitive pigs, and women are weak, shallow and bitchy"". Come on people. Surely we can do better that this!Isn't God's grace superabounding over these trivial matters?"
1,Bore-ring,"This movie was recommended to us by someone else. Thankfully, that person shall never pick movies for us ever again.The acting was painfully poor and the scenes were predicable at best. The entire time I was thinking ""That guy looks a lot like Kirk Cameron, too bad his acting isn't as good"".The basic theme throughout the movie is Christianity saves all, including your marriage. If you believe that, then good for you. My wife and I both had enough of this movie and it's Christian-themed-infomercial-masked-as-a-movie somewhere around the half-way point, so we turned it off."
4,"wholesome, realistic",I found this to be delightful and realistic as to what can happen in marriage. A Christian movie that doesn't rely on nudity or cussing to get the point across. Would recommend it to a friend any time!
5,Great inspirational movie - definitely watch it with your spouse!,Watch it with your spouse and get the Love Dare and the marriage kit with it. If you're serious about working on having a truly fulfilling marriage they're awesome tools.
5,Love it!!!!,My wife and i had seen this movie in the theatre and was surprised how odd the acting was in it. But you get used to it and find its a really good movie with a great message. So i had to own it. And then my wife and i just saw the movie couragous. And the acting is perfect. I will buy that movie too when it comes out. Sherwood pictures are doing a greatjob and each movie the make gets better and better. But each picture is great and have there own special messages.
5,great movie,Wish I had seen this sooner. Very good morals being taught in this. Love the father son connection. One we all need!
5,"Great movie, must see","This is a great movie that every married couple should watch. The problems will come, this is an example of how to deal with them in a succesfull way"
5,We need more films like this!!,"Whether we like to admit it or not, watching most of the hollywood movies these days affects us in negative ways. Just like with a computer, garbage in garbage out... We watch the trash that they put out - mostly because there is not much worth a darn coming out of that more evil than not place.This movie - FIREPROOF - has wonderful characters, an excellent story and most of all a positive message. If they'd had some directors/producers with more talent, it could have been a great movie, I felt the actors (especially Mr. Cameron) were very good.I hope they make more movies with good messages, little by little we can make a difference in what they put out!"
2,Just a Poor Movie,"Regardless of whether anyone thinks the Christian values being forced on the audience is good or bad, this was just a hands-down poorly made movie. The acting was, for the most part, treacherous, and the originality in cinematography and all other creative elements was non-existent. Yes, it does push a good message, but it is extremely unrealistic and I would place it in the ""bad chick-flick"" category. I felt guilty while I sat through it because I felt myself laughing during the serious scenes. I understand the intent of this movie, but the execution was just poor."
4,Quick Service,The video was a last minute decision for a Christmas gift. It arrived quickly and I was able to mail it in time for a Christmas delivery. Much appreciated. Thanks!
5,"Have seen, will buy....","The movie is about a marriage relationship which has been devastated due to selfishness, unkindness, and communication-breakdown on the part of both parties--and the resulting atrophy of heart these (very common) relationship-killers lead to. The movie holds out hope for the restoration of broken relationships and flies in the face of the current Hollywood-driven nonsense that the only way to true happiness is to ""follow your heart."" Statistics show that most folks follow their hearts right into the divorce courts.There is nothing more robust and intelligent than the Bible's insightful depiction of mankind--no one is exempt from its piercing review of human frailty. Fireproof gives us a look at how the Bible's powerful message of mercy, truth, and love--exemplified in the self-sacrificing example of Christ--can be applied to our ailing relationships, specifically marital relationships. And it is honest in its depiction that the journey may not be an easy one."
5,"Must see movie, for anyone who is married, has been married, or thinks they may ever get married!","This is the best movie that I have ever seen, that portrays how a marriage ought to work, and what marrieage is really all about.This is the only movie that I have ever watched 10 times before it left the theatre. Every person in America needs to see this movie, so they can get at least one proper view of how relationships ought to work, after seeing thousands and thousands of terrible views from television, movies, music, etc. Great action, Great comedy, and Great romance, all in one movie.m"
5,Great movie!,The main character is truly a wretched man. Tells the heart and mind behind a real struggling relationship that can never work out without God's working hand. It seemed like a story of a real life person and couple.
4,Great heart rending movie,This DVD is of excellent quality. I enjoyed all the features on it. All the bloopers and deleted scenes provided lots of extra bonus entertainment.The movie is an A++++. I'm a teacher and I was doing a series of lessons on marriage to my students. I showed it in one of my classes. My students (very particular and fussy young ladies I might add) loved the movie. They wanted to miss their lunch hour in order to see the entire movie. My colleagues said the same of her class. This movie is inspirational and a must for those who are married or contemplating marriage one day. Loved it!!!!!
4,Kirk Cameron,"I enjoyed this movie. Not great, not bad; better than many, but worthy of no Oscars. But I will say this: I've seen plenty of movies in my time, and I've seen actors and actresses be angry on screen, very angry. Yet this is the first time ever that I ever really believed a character was angry. When Cameron becomes angry at his wife early in the movie and starts yelling at her, I cringed because I really sensed that this was not acting, but that he really was ballistic at her, like a line had been crossed from acting to real anger.I've never sensed this before, but Cameron let me sense real anger, anger that I myself have felt. It blew me away in a sort of scary way.Was he acting? Sure, but I couldn't tell at all; that's what was amazing."
3,"Imperfect, but good movie","it really doesn't matter if you're a Christian or a Zen Mystic. This movie is about a man acting purely out of faith. Initially it was a small amount of faith, but faith that something would change. People can applaud ""Slumdog Millionaire"" and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" which both have tenents of faith about them but because this has some Christian themes it's a big problem.What i did have an issue with is the acting, writing and direction. It's was B-Movie level production. That said, I quickly got over that once the story began to unfold. Stick with this to the end it's worth it."
4,Definitely works!,"Flies stick and don't come off, so it works. It worked well in catching the fruit flies and gnats too."
4,Good Buy,"At first I was going to write that this product is a good buy for the price. However, I bought an expensive Plantonic headset hoping that I would get better range and sound quality. I found out that unless you are willing to put out mega bucks, they all work about the same. In that respect, this is a great product for the price."
1,Don't buy this,"If you are looking for a 3/4 size guitar, this is not the one for you. We purchased this for our 10 year old daughter. When she took it to her first lesson the instructor told us that it is not a 3/4 size, but closer to a 1/4, which is not the correct size for a 10 year old. Now we are trying to return it and get the correct size, but have had nothing but hassles."
5,Yamaha Jr a Great Buy!,Perfect for beginners! It sounds really good too. It's a very good guitar for practice because it is portable so I just grab it whenever I feel like playing it and it does not hurt your pocket. The price and the free Amazon shipping makes a perfect purchase. I would have gone with a guitalele but I'm glad I bought the Yamaha Jr because the guitalele's chords are not same on the regular acoustic guitar so I don't want to confuse myself even further. I'd say this purchase is a perfect one for me. I will buy the Yamaha FG730s for serious and quality sound jamming!
5,Excellent student guitar for the youngster,"My 5-1/2-year-old daughter just started taking lessons 2 months ago, and this Yamaha is a great fit for her needs. Crisp tonality and ability to stay tuned make the guitar a great purchase for us. Her teacher highly recommends this guitar, as it can easily be played by an adult as well, meaning that the life of the guitar isn't limited as the student becomes older. In fact, its smaller size (read: portability) makes this my go-to guitar to play (over my own guitar) at the children's ministry at church.The only downside is the thin gigbag. Because my daughter is so young, she doesn't exercise as much caution with the guitar as I would like (which is a testament to how well it stays tuned). I'm looking into the better endowed Taylor Guitars Baby Gig Bag so the Yamaha can outlast my daughter's 5-year-old tendencies.I highly recommend the Yamaha FG JR1 3/4 size acoustic guitar for both young and old."
4,first guitar,Nice guitar for a little kid. I got for my 8 year old son and he loves it. Its small but thats what he wanted.
1,There are better choices for the money,"I borrowed my friends guitar in order to get my nephew to play. It is junk. With new strings, it still sounds lousy. The tuning machines are poor quality, one of the pegs keeps popping out, and the action is lousy (like any guitar comes out of the box unfortunately). I have had several guitars. While it is possible to buy a $130 guitar that is o-kaaay, you still need a luthier to set it up. In my opinion you get what you pay for and there is a reason that Martins and Gibsons cost over $2000 for a decent instrument. That aside, for kids starting out I would avoid this piece of junk and get something better, even an Epiphone maybe."
2,Beware of the Steel Strings,"This was purchased as a first guitar gift for my kids. I admittedly don't know much about guitars, but one of the things that make things difficult learning a guitar is sore fingers and apparently nylon strings are easier on the fingers than steel strings.Just wanted to let everyone know although this guitar appears to be marketed toward kids, it has steel strings... so beware.Otherwise the guitar sounds good for the price."
2,Crows Over The Wheat Fields - van Gogh,"While the print looks very beautiful, this particular poster has a 3-inch white border all around the actual art. I custom-ordered a frame to be used with this poster when it arrived and, of course, had to modify the poster afterward. Unacceptable. White border should be either nonexistent or mentioned in the advertisement."
3,Clock radio telephone,"This item has all the features that I wanted. The telephone works well and I am no longer tethered by my bed. However, there is some problem with the alarm volume. Even though I reset it to be low every day, it still comes on at high volume every morning. I have to struggle to turn it down before it wakes the world. That's a relatively small price to pay for having all the other features."
2,Could be better,After purchasing this item to replace my old clock radio telephone (even though I am not a fan of GE) I found that the radio alarm on both alarms did not work. Not having the time or the patience to return it to Amazon (who I am sure would make good on this defective piece of junk) I decided to keep it and use the buzzer alarm (not too pretty to awaken in the AM with). Beware of GE products.
2,Horrible radio,This is a good looking combo clock radio phone with some very serious flaws. The A/M radio is among the worst I have ever seen. The different stations are mixing together to make it almost unlistenable. Unless you live in an area with few stations-forget it. I sent to first unit back to Amazon only to find the second one was the same. The phone ringer has only the most basic electronic ringers-awful.
4,Great phone/Good size,"The phone is sleek and doesn't take up too much space. Our only complaint is that the LED screen is still too bright even on the lowest setting. The other features more than make up for that, however."
1,"poor design, poorly executed","The display is light blue on darker blue, and you can either turn the brightness up enough for it to be a nightlight shining in your face at night, or down enough to where you cannot read it even in the dark. Mine died after a month and a half."
3,phone review,The display is not as bright as it should be and not real easy to see in the dark even on the high setting. Also the ringer on the phone is very different and not easy to hear even on loud.
1,Shoddy,"I thought this was just the phone/clock-radio combination I needed. But it has been a disappointment almost from the beginning. First the clock runs slow enough I have to set it every month or two, which should be just about inconceivable with a digital clock. Then, the display started to deteriorate in the handset, to the point that we cannot read the number or ID of the caller -- it looks like that alien language on the screens in the Star Wars movies. And now, the clock display is so dark it is unreadable -- on the brightest setting. So there is no way to read the caller ID, no way to see the clock, and the time may be wrong if you could see it -- all of this in less than a year!The radio still works, though."
3,Good but,"Great clock and has all of the features I want and need being in Florida where the power is intermittent at best. The handset is high pitched and has some distortion especially when speaking into it, the phone rests in the cradle backwards. If there is any bad weather that rocks the phone lines with moisture and such it will read ""Line in use"". I really love the unit and would buy it again but I believe the quality could be a lot better. I would pay more for the same exact unit that had more quality to it. It is functional and the features are great!Update: It finally got zapped in a power surge."
1,Defective !!,"I initialy had high hopes for this GE made phone/radio. But alas... the radio reception was weak and the phone was defective and did not work. Also, the alarm clock set up process was very user unfriendly.I decided to try another brand.If you DO decide to purchase this GE model, be careful when you open the package. The seller won't take returns without all the original wrapping in un-torn condition."
2,Phone/radio review,"Very difficult learning curve. Instruction are poorly written. To date, I have not been able to get radio reception without getting extreme bleed-over from other stations. AM, even with antenna, is out of the question."
3,"Functional, but there are better ones out there","I bought this to replace the GE 26985GE1, which lasted forever until my kids dumped a glass of water on it. I'm not thrilled with the ""upgrade.""Cons:The ring tones are terrible; there isn't a normal sounding choice.The alarm is difficult to turn on and off.Pros:Big display.You can set the amount of ""snooze"" time.It is what it says it is: a cordless telephone / clock / radio. I think I'd rather have my old one back, though."
1,Disappointing Product for GE,"The quality and feature set on this product are disappointing, particularly for a GE product. The instructions are poor, and the unit does not respond to some of the instructions - in fact, it appears that the instructions might have been written for another rev of the product. The handset key tones cannot be turned off. The ringer selection is very limited and sounds cheap. The hand set feels cheap.I'm sending it back."
3,clock redio,the service was great got the itlems in real good shape and as told but fm station do not come in like they should
1,What a piece of Junk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This unit simply does not work! Sometimes it even does not get tone, sometimes decides to stop transmitting, cutting the mic. all of a sudden, sometimes I have to set it 6 or 7 times in the craddle to reset it. I need a unit with 2.4Ghz Cordless / Call ID / AMFM digitally tuned receiver/ and alarm clock; You would think by the year 2006 this could be acomplished by a ""relative newcomer"" to home appliances and electronics like GE, evidently not. Im returning this clunker, definitively!Give a wide berth."
1,Phone is not worth it,"Thought the combo would take up less space on bedside furniture, but it is not an attractive piece, not easy to use, can barely hear the phone ring and overall S--ks!"
2,Disappointed,I am very disappointed in this product because I cannot get a clear reception. I am constantly changing channels but the reception is still full of static and hissing sounds. I like the color of the phone and the adjustable lighting. It serves as a nice night light.
1,A phone that works for only 6 weeks?,"Ordered on line December 6th 2009. Great looking, sound was great,alarm was easy to set,time was visible from across the room Then after six weeks from the day of purchase, I was not able to make any outgoing calls. I changed the battery, detatched and reattached wires (as per instructions) but nothing helped. I returned the phone on January 28th and am waiting for my refund."
2,Uncertain,I bought this for a Christmas gift and it is now not working. Not sure what happened?? It was great for 1 month.
1,"Static on most stations, hard to program",I hate this clock radio phone. It doesn't pick up hardly any stations and its very hard to program. The phone has poor sound quality as well. I can't believe I wasted this much money on this item.
2,Poor sound quality and design,"I needed a new alarmclock/phone for my bedroom. This looked like a good choice from the reviews.However the sound quality of the phone is terrible. I can hardly hear the person on the line, even if I turn the sound all the way up.Also the design is bad. When you pick the phone up from the cradle, you actually have to turn it around. It sits backwards.In other words, if you pick it up with your right hand like normal, the earpiece will be down by your mouth and vice versa.Not a huge deal, but someone was not thinking when they designed this.I am not sure why they use a blue light background. If you turn it down low at night, you can't read the time...all you can see is blue.And turn it up any brighter and it lights the entire bedroom up.I thought about returning it, but was too lazy. So will keep it and bear with the issues."
3,Adequate replacement Clock/Radio/Phone,"Bought this phone to replace an older clock/radio/phone that was no longer working properly. I like the size and styling, but the alarms are difficult to turn off early in the the morning when you are half-asleep. The snooze button is easy to use, but I have to get up immediately and do not really need the snooze feature. It is difficult to locate the proper button and easily turn it to the off mode. Other than that small problem it has been a good phone and I use the caller ID and caller memory to check calls that come in while I am away."
2,phone review,"I returned this phone after only a few weeks because the phone part stopped working. The clock worked fine but the cordless reciever stopped working. I returned the phone to Amazon about 1 week ago and still have not had any confirmation. I did re-buy the phone again in a store (for easier returns). I wanted to give it another try because it had everything I wanted in an alarm clock radio. Cordless, caller id, 2 alarms and sleek design. If this phone works fine then I would give it 4/5 stars. I'm hoping I just got a bad one. But it does have everything in a nice compact bedside phone."
4,No speakerphone,"This is very good bedside phone and clock radio, however it clearly says in the description that the phone includes speakerphone. I was surprised to discover that the actual phone does not have speakerphone capability after all.On a closer reading of the description it appears perhaps they were talking about some of the features on other models, but clearly confusing.Otherwise I'm happy with it."
5,GE Telephone/Radio,"I really loved this product. It has a clear sound and the phone works well with a neat system of call tracking. Most of it was extremely easy to setup, but I had problems setting up the right radio station with the alarms. I called their support department and they were patient and thorough until I finally got it right."
1,GE 2.4 GHz 27980GE3 Cordless Bedroom Phone with AM/FM,"I was not happy with this product at all. The colon between the hour and minutes continuously blinks, very annoying. When a new call comes in the New Call button flashes continuously until you lift the handset, so if you answer another extention is stays blinking. The display is either way too bright, the whole room is illuminated or the lowest setting you can't read it. Also had problems with Caller ID. For the price I was thoroughly disappointed. Returned mine!"
3,Clock Alarm and Phone radio,"This product looked OK on paper. However, I found that the lighted screen which displays the time is not very good. It is hard to see in a dark room - not enough briliance and/or contrast. The phone works well and the controls are not difficult to handle. However, unless you work with the controls (timer, setting alarm, etc.) almost on a daily basis, you have to refer to the instructions manual to se the alarms.."
1,DON'T BUY IT!!,"This unit is terrible!!! Very inconvenient to use. The directions are poorly written. Each morning we wake up guessing whether we will wake up to the AM station we ""set it for"" or to static on an FM station. Even if I double check it we're still guessing. The 1st unit I got was defective, this is the 2nd one."
4,nice phone/radio,"Although it has a couple of features that aren't great, overall it is a real bargain. The phone works great and so does the radio. There are 3 things that could be improved, 1. the contrast on the display, 2 the ring tone is not great (pretty obnoxious) 3. the instructions on how to shut off the alarm are very unclear; it's easy once you figure it out but the directions are bad. This product was replacing an older GE model that was just about perfect. Everything worked great for many years. I would still have it if the buttons on the phone didn't start to stick."
4,Worth the cost,Quality of the phone matches the price. The features along with the clarity of sound from the phone make it worth the $50 paid for it. It would of been nice if there were an automatic screen dimmer vs. the manual one as to set it to be fully viewable in the day makes it too bright at night.
3,Had everything I needed except a speaker phone,"I've looked for a product like this everywhere, but it still didn't have the one feature I needed and that is a handset speaker phone. So I sent it back."
4,I recommend it,I like this product but some features could be improved:* Not intuitive. You will need to read the instructions manual* Radio reception not that good* Display too bright at nightThe cordless telephone is very good and it saves a lot of space next to my bed being three in one.
1,Messed up our caller ID,"We have removed this phone from operation, because with it plugged in, our caller ID in the house stopped working. We also had issues with some calls going directly to voicemail and not ringing in the house. Verizon came out to the house and after a lot of detective work, they found the issue was the phone. When we unplugged it, no more issues. I would have returned the phone but I had thrown away the paperwork.Other than that issue, the phone, its functions, etc. were all great, but beware of these issues if you get this phone."
2,LCDs are a problem,"It is a great idea to combine all these functions to minimize space occupied on the bedside table, but no designers seem to have tested the ergonomics of LCDs in these devices.We have sought a telephone clock radio since our last one died. We have bought and returned three, including one GE, because LCDs are generally a terrible design choice in this type of device. If brightness is high enough to read the time in a dark room then it will keep you awake, but if it is dim enough for comfortable sleep then there is not enough contrast to read the time when you awake in the middle of the night.Yes, LCDs allow all sorts of information about bell and whistle 'features', but LED displays do not have the contrast problem.We still are looking for a reasonable replacement."
5,Great phone with features,"There are several features that I like about this bedroom phone/radio/alarm clock. The alarm buzzer is so different than any other alarm clock I've used I get up with the first alarm, there are two available. The ring tone is different than most do it will get your attention, or you can just disable it. There are several brightnesses for the display which is nice when it comes to trying to sleep at night. Overall I only needed an alarm clock but I got a great phone and radio that is easy to use and takes care of a variety of needs."
5,""" You Gotta Have it - - - Phone""","11/4/06 I recently purchased this phone from another seller, I didnot know this phone ever existed. I decided to look on Amazon. Com and I was shocked it was 45 dollars cheaper and I even got free shipping and handling so I ordered another phone from Amazon at a cheaper price I kept the first one for myself and ordered the second one for my teenage son. I like this phone it has great features and I really need the 2 alarms it provides the caller Id and menu are bright and bold and the instructions are easy. Its fashionable it provides everything I need it to do for me and my son I was tired of trying to wake him up now he can arise to his favorite rap songs. The customer on 7/30/2006 really gave a great review and rating of this product. I total agree and it has everything I need in a compact unit. Thank you and sincerely, Rhoda Lynette"
4,"Nice, multifunction, package.","I am pleased with the performance of this unit. The phone has good range, a nice clear, static-free sound, and caller ID. The radio (which can serve as your wakeup call) has easy tuning, good reception and reasonably good sound for a unit this small. My only disappointment is the clock face. It is a backlit LCD that is very bright. A control allows you to lower the brightness in three increments, but at the lowest setting, it is very difficult to see the numerals - they are pretty much washed out. The next higher brightness setting ends up illuminating the whole bedroom.Otherwise, it is a very nice product."
1,bad design,"At first look this is a very nice looking clock radio with great features,but don't waste your money. The time display is hard to read from any angle but straight on, the AM can't receive even a 50,000 watt radio station that's 20mi away, the phone ringer is soft, and the telephone handset is very hard to grasp to lift it from the cradle. Most GE products are very good, but they missed it with this one!"
3,"Just ""Fair"" Radio","Perhaps I am old-fashioned, but in ordering this radio/telephone for $89. I was expecting a good radio. The problem I have is with the sound quality. I am not an engineer or technician by any stretch, but I believe it is the body of the radio that causes the poor quality of the sound. I have a GE clock radio that I have had at least 30 years, and it has much better sound.This radio has a very ""tinny"" sound that is sometimes very hard to understand if someone is speaking (as opposed to music)."
3,phone hard to set,have had the phone a month now and still have not got it set. I'll have to work on it.I think it will be fine.The buttons just don't respond.
5,Found my replacement and love it!,"I had a GE Bedroom phone/clock radio that I purchased in 2000. I loved it but cranked up the speakers regularly, blowing out some of the quality at a high level. This phone is it's replacement. I love it with the many newer features, reasonable price, and can only hope to get 9+ years out of this phone/clock radio, too. Amazon and Digital Distributors were easy and fast to deal with. This could have been a ""hard to find"" item; but not with Amazon! Thanks Amazon and Digital Distributors!"
1,Dissatisfied with recent purchase GE cordless clock radio phone,"This GE cordless clock radio phone has many things wrong with it. The alarm will not set. The colon on the time has an annoying blink which cannot be turned off. One cannot read the time unless you are standing directly in front of it. Worst of all the company will not refund my money. They will simply send another which will hopefully work this time. And if it doesn't, I suppose I just keep wrapping up a phone and sending it back (all at my expense). There were good reviews of this phone but an equal number of bad ones. Don't buy this phone."
5,Heartland,"This is a great series! If you like westerns or horses this would be a must see. It works for everyone in our family, engaging enough for an adult and interesting to our teens and preteens. I would definately recommend, 5 stars! Ordering from Amazon was fast,easy, and cheaper."
4,Family Show,Heartland is a show about life on a horse ranch. Tells a story about how this family handles every day things that happen. Great show for young people.
4,"Great series, but video quality is odd","I enjoyed watching season 1 and up through episode 9 of season 2 on Netflix streaming. So, I have purchased the ""Complete Season 2"" set in order to continue. As expected, the story line continues with the usual twists and turns, but what has disappointed me is a ""graininess"" in the video as displayed from my Samsung Blu-Ray player. I don't know where to attribute this - the streaming 1080 input was sharp and clear, but what I'm seeing is sharp but in the mid-tones there is an annoying graininess. I try to ignore it and enjoy the story, but it gets in the way at the most inopportune times. Without that problem, I'd rate it 5 stars."
1,Boo,IT was good but I didn't receive the full second season I had two DVDs the same and it seemed like one of them was missing
5,Hartland,It was a great series for all the family and at time you could get relate to yourself when you were growing up
2,It didn't,I already did a review but you deleted it because you only want lies and praises whether it deserved it or not. My opinion of it has not changed. It was not worth the money I spent on it. I love the show but 1/2 of the second season was reruns of the 1st and there were two bad spots where it did just stopped before finishing the episode and didn't run the credits at the end. So unless it was a flawed set and I get a good one sent to me my review will not change.
2,missing episodes,it was missing episodes so i sent it back so that i could by the other season that had the shows
3,Wrong movie,I am pretty sure I ordered the third season and received season two. We already have season two. That stunk for my kids on Christmas :(
5,Heartland,I really enjoyed it. I didn't mind having some of Saeason 3 on there too. I would purshase the rest of the serise as well.
5,great shows,"new item, would recommend this show to anyone wanting clean family viewing with a good message or lesson to be learned!"
1,Avoid this GE phone at all costs,"This phone is junk. The handsets forget that they belong to the base unit frequently, so it is likely that you will not be able to place or take a call from anywhere other than the base unit without reconfiguring the hand set at the base unit.In the rare case that the phones work, only one person can ever pick up on a call. The extra handsets do you no good when more than one person wants to join in on the call.I'd used some good inexpensive phones from GE in the past, but will never buy another one from then after this one. Free is too much money for this phone. After a year of pain with this junk, I now have a wonderful replacement from Panasonic."
1,"It's a ""lemon""","I agree with everyone who purchased this now worthless phone. Not only can I barely hear the caller on the other end, but the caller ID display is fading -- one is totally gone! I too got suckered into the discounted price...and, less then a year later, I'm looking for another phone. DON'T BUY IT!"
2,great idea..but make sure to operate in absolute silence,"My experience with these particular phones is that they are way too quiet. My brother-in-law bought the same ones. I decided to go with these because of the cool ring tones, answering maachine, and speaker phone feature. What a disappointment. I use it as an answering machine but rely on a two dollar wired phone from Goodwill if I need to converse.If anything is making any noise in the house, or if you're talking to someone who's soft-spoken, you had better reach for a different phone, because these are way too quiet, even with the volume at maximum. Same goes for the speakerphone. You nearly have to hold it up to your ear to hear what people are saying. This could actually be a perfect solution to the low volume, if the speaker for the speakerphone weren't on the back of the phone."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE AND ON ALL 3 PHONES THE SCREEN WENT OUT ON IT AFTER 6 MONTHS SO NOW I HAVE TO BUY ANOTHER PHONE SO I CAN SEE WHO'S CALLING. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!GE Cordless 5.8 GHz Edge 25951EE3 Phone with 3 Handsets, Call Waiting Caller ID and Digital Answering System"
2,No Good,"We received these phones as a Christmas gift and they are on their way back. We can not hear anything on them, it sounds like everyone is whispering. They do not have nearly as many of the nice features as some of the other expandable phone systems do. I would not recommend them at all."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!,"Purchased this phone set on sale. Now I know why it was so deeply discounted. The units are nothing but junk! Can't hear a thing on any of the handsets. If I could rate this lower than 1 star, I would."
3,It's not working,"May be a great item, but so far we haven't even gotten the answering machine to work and are in the process of returning the phones"
3,Item misrepresented by seller,"I purchased this phone because I already have another one which I really like. Unfortunately the seller advertised this as a new phone when, in fact, it is reconditioned and has seen alot of use by a previous owner given the fact that the paint is worn off the ear piece. I also can't seem to stop the phone from playing ""The Flight of the Bumblebee"" when it rings! The handsets are already designated by the previous owner on the caller ID screen as kitchen, master bedroom and living room.In short,I have always been happy with this particular GE phone model but am not at all happy that the phone is not new as advertised.Susan ShaugerBuckland, MA"

2,It's too hard and too tall,"This foam is not the real memory foam. It's hard and still smells after two months. It's ok for side sleeping only. I should've bought a real memory foam pillow like the other reviewers suggested. My old one was perfect, but is now too flat."
1,It's like a stone..,"I bought this one last week.. It's too hard for me, it's like a stone. I had been used another memory foam pillows about 4 years, but they are not like this. If you want a hard one, this is what you are looking for. But if you not, don't buy this :)"
2,Not very soft,"Perhaps if someone is looking for a firm pillow this will be great. Personally, I found it far too firm, which also made the pillow too high. I have a memory foam mattress and its much softer."
2,I did not like this pillow,I have had several memory foam pillows and I found this too hard and less than giving. I returned it and subsequently bought a Serta meomory foam pillow for a couple of dollars more. It was so far superior in quality in every way to this. Real Memory foam that acted like memory foam and MADE IN THE USA( not in China like this one)
4,"Yes, this is what I was looking for","I have been looking for a smart looking, powerful, hand-held vacuum cleaner for upholstry, carpets and my car interior. I bought Euro-Pro's Shark EP 85 SS. I used it. Found it has almost everything I was looking for. Except: Retractable power cord. I found in the store another Euro-Pro Shark model with retractible cord, but it has less power (850W). The product would have got from me all the 5 stars if this model too had retractible cord."
4,Hardwood Floors Solution,"I had been looking for a vacuum to cleam my hardwood floors for months. Nothing worked. Everything scratched my floors, but this little wonder did wonders on my floors. It works great to clean hardwood floors. Does not scratch floorsMy only oops..would be that the extension tubes fall out from time to time so its alittle bit of a hassle to be squeezing them tight, but overall GREAT JOB SHARK."
2,This is a vacuum?,"This vacuum is okay for cleaning up ceral, or some dirt but if you have pets be affraid! This machine does not pick up pet hair of furniture, or carpeting - and the little it does pick up ends up clogging the vacuum. If you are doing light cleanup - and I do mean light this is for you! Another bad feature the really short hose - what is that all about!"
4,Good basic materials book,Engineer to Win is a good book for anyone wanting information on metals and the science involved. I am an engineering student so I found a lot of the information very basic as it is covered in materials science within engineering. So things are slighty outdated but overall a good book for anyone with little knowledge of materials science.
4,Pleasantly surprised increased throttle response.,"Very pleased with this product. The install (2013 Dodge Challenger RT) was a little more difficult than expected, and I was surprised to discover that the instructions called for cutting away part of the engine cover. That being said, I immediately noticed a delightful increase in throttle response, which alone is worth the money for me. The car also sounds angrier at high revs. Would recommend this product to others."
5,Easy ordering for a good price,"It was easy to order and it was shipped to me in two days,and the product is quality.What more can you ask for."
4,Sellouts,I don't know who is more of a sellout? Movie makers or the companies that pay for product placement. I recommend watching this.
1,The Greatest Movie Never Sold,"I expected to love this DVD but once I opened the case, I knew I would hate it. There was no DVD in the case. Thanks for nothing, Amazon."
4,Why isn't this movie more famous?,"Spurlock's ""Supersize Me"" is rather well known, but his other films are worth watching, too. I enjoyed ""Greatest Movie,"" especially because I watched it with my advertising-student daughter, so I understood it more than I could have on my own. But it would be fascinating for anyone who would like to see what goes on behind the scenes of product placement. But be warned -- after watching this movie, you will be compelled to go right out and buy some POM Wonderful!"
1,I Love Documentaries but....,"I rented this movie on Amazon video service and so glad i didnt buy it. First of all, I am an avid documentary fan, but I didnt see the point in this movie. Mr. Spurlock has excellent movie making abilities, but he forgot one main element...a point to prove.Unlike Supersize me, this movie simply restates the fact that ads are all around us, in an uncreative and unneccessary manner. The whole time i was wondering ""Duh"", this stuff is so obvious, and cant claim to learn anything.I would not reccommend this movie, but would recommend Mr. Spurlock's other movies."
3,"Ironically, it's one long commercial","I like Morgan Spurlock and his approach to making documentaries but this one misses the mark. While it's definitely watchable and has interesting parts, the film inadvertently becomes guilty of doing the same things that it criticizes mainstream movies for doing.It's a neat idea to have corporate sponsors pay for the production of the movie but the problem is that it takes over the entire documentary. Literally 80-90% is Morgan seeking out advertisers and only a tiny fraction covers the premise of the title.So how much does corporate sponsorship influence Hollywood? Are advertisers drawn to scripts or are scripts written entirely to promote certain products? What is the agenda? All of these are great questions the film teases us with but never really answers in any detail. And that's a shame since it's a fascinating topic and Morgan Spurlock should be been the perfect guy to expose product placement practices."
5,Excellent Reference Book,"Logsdon provides the expertise needed plant, grow, harvest, and store all common (and some uncommon) grains using a low level of technology. If you want to know how to raise your own grains without major equipment - THIS IS THE BOOK. At least some of this knowledge is in danger of being lost. An EXCELLENT reference book!"
1,sorry I spent money on this,"The book's title and conceit piqued my interest, but I should have read more than a few pages before buying it... what a dull book!! There are a few interesting ideas in the intro, but the rest is just rambling and LOTS of unrelated (irrelevant?) references. I'm obsessed with einstein, but I couldn't get through this; it was excruciating reading.the book is more about the author's distaste for the field of physics than it is about einstein; he spends so much time rambling about physics in general, that you have to wade through pages and pages just to get to any einstein-related information -- and even then you don't know whether to trust it or not.my grasp of relativity is pretty basic, but the sections on relativity are misleading, and in at least one instance I caught the author in a basic error... after that, I just put the book down and gave up."
1,Richard Atkins is an ignorant,"The 567 references are there. Yet, most of them are junk, or unrelated to the subject of the book. Or, in many cases, relevant references which are misquoted and/or misrepresented by the author. But, of course, in order to know that one has to actually read the book and check the references before writing a critique.Hero culture? What kind of BS is that? Next thing the author is going to tell us is that Van Gogh was blind and that his paintings are due to his dog. And then Mr. Atkins will wag his tail and bark ""hero culture""......Basic intellectual honesty and rigor are completely lacking inthis book, and in Mr. Atkins critique."
1,something smells fishy with this book,"This book deals exclusively with the theory of relativity. It's funny that that theory was studied and expanded by many of the brightest minds in the world, such as Richard Feynman, Paul Dirac, and Steven Weinberg, all of them Nobel prize winners, some of them experts in the history of physics, and nobody noticed anything remotely similar to ""plagiarism"". It took a complete unknown like the author, without academic qualifications of any kind, to ""discover"" the ""plot"".Something smells very fishy here. I strongly suspect the problem is not with the author of the theory of relativity, but with the author of this book.Well, I guess everybody has to eat, and some people find ways of earning their beans with more dignity than others..............."
1,This book is junk.,"I had the displeasure of reading this rag and I wanted to write a scathing review about it. As I am a scientist, but not a physicist, I prefer to let a better credentialed person speak for me. This in not plagiarism, since I am giving credit to the linked author, so please, conspiracy theorists, don't claim that it is.Read this review, written by a real physicist, (with a Ph.D. in physics) and philosopher about this book:http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/17201"
1,A little about the author,"Do a search for Christopher Jon Bjerknes in Google or Yahoo and you will find his authorship of many anti semitic rants and then you'll understand all you need to know about the quality of this book. I gave it one star because if's useful to see how the anti-semitic, anti-Israeli industry manufactures propoganda."
1,Chris Bjerkens : The Incorrigible Trash Writer,"This book should be dumped by Amazon. It is nothing more than ""aryan - nation"" propaganda. If Brjkens' allegations about general relativity were tru then how come that :1. Hilbert conceded ?2. Hilbert never raised the issue ?"
1,A bigot's delight,"Albert Einstein is the greatest and most original thinker in the history of mankind. He was a Jew. He was a Zionist. Some people cannot swallow that. If you feel like you choke and you cannot breathe when you read this, then this book is for you. Enjoy it!"
4,Worth every penny,"Very comfortable. I went on trip as a tourist, where I knew I would need to walk a lot. I don't like to wear sneakers in the summer so a comfortable sandal was the only choice. This sandal did it, I was problably walking around for 3+ hours and my feet didn't scream once!If I changed one thing, it would be the fit around my toes. I found myself holding the sandal close to my foot as I walked; it didn't hurt but walking would take a little less work."
5,This is THE BOOK on this topic!,"I must respectfully disagree with the previous reviewers opinion and am wondering if he/she actually read the book? I have read the book and found it absolutely delightful! It was very enlightening and fun reading as well. In fact, the book is so above average, that it makes me seriously question whether the negative reviewer has an agenda of some kind. I thought Ms. Wu's book showed the greatest reverence for the spirit of the Tao, which is more than I can say for the mean-spirited reviewer."
5,My daughter loved it!,"I'm not into origami myself, but my daughter is. I thought the paper might be a little small, but apparently not. We bought this as a stocking stuffer, and she loves it! We now have all sorts of brightly colored animals decorating any flat surface. It arrived quickly and without problems."
3,Origami paper pattern,"Got this as a gag gift, but everyone loved it. Lots of patterns and paper for the price. Very interesting. You could get hooked and go onto bigger projects."
5,ORAGAMI PAPER,MY SON HAD A PROJECT ON JAPAN AND HE USED THIS SUBJECT TO TALK ABOUT. IT WAS EASY AND FUN AND HE GOT AN A ON THE PROJECT.
4,Papers are good I expect some more better for the price.,I was looking for double sided different colored paper. But I found only patterned papers in it. Those who want to buy this product kindly validate your need against what is inside. Here are some of the information.1. All 49 sheets are single side (One side it is white and other side it is colored).2. All 49 sheets got patterns like little flower outline or some pattern.These are good fro beginners.
5,Great variety!,"I bought this to use at work with teens as a way to build patience, persistence, and team building skills. They loved the variety in this pack, including that one side of the paper is patterned and the back is a solid coordinating pattern. In some designs where you see both sides of the paper this paper is perfect because you don't just see the pattern and a lot of white like you did with normal sheets. With this paper you see a much more put together piece of art."
2,For the traveler that's NOT off the beaten track,"For the traveler that intends to leave the beaten path, be aware that this atlas misses off hundreds of villages in between larger towns and cities. After spending four months in Cambodia, Vietnam, and Laos I found this atlas to be dead weight in my pack. However, Lonely Planet publishes an atlas for each individual country, which has more detailed secondary roads, natural features, and remote villages. Moreover, if you do not have the luxury of four months plus at your disposal and you are traveling in these fascinating countries in a rush, this atlas will more than likely meet your needs."
1,Worst Map of the Region,"Claiming to be ""the best, most up-to-date source of maps"" for the region this is a book by Lonely Planet that holds nothing it promises. I used the Laos and the Thailand maps to bike from the Chinese border at Boten to Bangkok via Luang Namtha, Luang Prabang, Vientiane, Udon Thani and Korat. I found that not a single (!) information regarding distances was right. And they weren't off by a few kilometres but rather by 10 up to 25 km (Udomxai to Pak Mong). Further the maps, especially in Thailand, depict roads to be unpaved where according to local information (and Thai maps) they were paved since more than a few years. The topographic shading is sloppy at best, if not completely incorrect. The mistakes are far beyond the ""things change fast"" warning published in every Lonely Planet guidebook and signal a further deterioration of quality at Lonely Planet. I strongly advice against buying it, it's just a rip-off!"
2,These things are like a laxative,"I bought these as a reward while dieting. The taste was weird, nothing like regular conversation hearts. Also, less than 1/2 hour after eating about 8 hearts, I experienced a stomach ache with a laxative-like side effect."
4,Original Mozart Style,"i receive this cd form amazon.com, i love the first clip, the arranged for the music of Mozart are beautyful, very inspirational, nice version of very artist like Bela Fleck, his version of this sonata are magnificent, very original, and other way to hear mozart music, maintenance the essential of the music author, buy this Cd if you love the classic music, and the jazz music same, the fussion are excellent and for sleep moment is nice hear this album"
4,Haunting,"For what it is, this composition is a fine work of art, practically perfect. It suits the mood for when the mood strikes, so it's not like you would listen to this all the time (unless you are creepy like that). Great piano and other textures."
1,Not what I was expecting,"For those who are familiar with Porcupine Tree, and Steven Wilsons side projects Blackfield and No-Man, but have never heard what Bass Communion sounds like, I recommend not finding out. ""Loss"" like other Bass Communion releases is nothing but background white-noise mixed with a couple of low-end piano notes here and there. For a project that Wilson claims is his ""personal labor of love"", it certainly doesn't show. The real ""loss"" was the $30 plus shipping it took to buy this cd. Sorry Steve, but I think I'll stick with Blackfield and No-Man."
4,Women of Eden,I read this one years ago and wanted to read it again. It was terrific the second time around too! Great romantic fun!
5,What a pity !,Coming new to Canada and beeing not so firm in english reading I got this book at a selling off in the libary! I dont get them all at our Library any more! Wanted to read them all.I think it is very pity that these books are not print again!
3,Hard to use,"I have been some what disapointed in the Lansky Sharpening. The guide rods swivle back and forth causing the stone to roll and the edge of the stone comes in contact with the edge of the blade. Other like sharpeners that I have used the guide bar was screwed into the stone and easier to use. The grip on the blade will not get tight enough to keep the blade from moving on small blades or long blades. I went back to the old fashioned way, holing the knife in one hand the the stone in the other. Think I'll invest in a large tri-angle sharpening system."
5,Works great! Makes sharpening easy,I no longer dread sharpening my pocket knives. Easy to follow directions. Made sharpening quick & easy.
4,Knife sharpening made easy,"Very pleased with this knife sharpener. I had tried to sharpen knives, scissors and other items free hand but could not get a consistant angle and so items were not very sharp.After reading the reviews on Amazon, I decided to go with the Lansky sharpening system. Very happy with my purchase and I now have sharp pocket knives and scissors. Have not tried to do serrated edges yet, but will try that next.Only disappointment with this system, would have liked the parts to be a little studier feeling otherwise I am well pleased."
2,Cheap and Dangerous,"I'm disappointed with this Lansky system. It's my first set angle sharpening system, and I think I'll stick with flat stones from now on. The problem is that you have to hold the clamp while sharpening and the clamp begins to loosen as you sharpen (especially with odd shaped knives like tantos). I purchased a Smith's diamond stone after this and it has performed wonderfully and quickly. If you need a good sharpener, skip this and either get a higher quality system, or get a few nice stones."
1,I should have known better,"Among my knives I have some Global Japanese kitchen knives. These need to be sharpened at 10-15 degrees. This thing starts at 17 degrees. Even at that angle the jig doesn't allow a small knife to be sharpened. The jig and it's screws get in the way. It won't sharpen penknives or whittling knives for the same reason. Apart from that, the whole system reminds me of some Rube Goldberg kludge. Too many fiddling bits. It is sized only for a wide paring knife. Anything bigger requires too many adjustments and changes, it would take hours to do a chef's knife. Just buy a whetstone and learn how to use it for your particular knives."
2,Might work for some...,"Two knives tried, and both are now duller than they were before using the ""Lansky System"". Sadly my quest for the ""No talent needed"" sharpening system continues, and this product and mounting system I bought separately for go into the junk drawer.Only reason I give it two stars is because so many other reviews say they are having good luck with it. I suppose it's possible I'm doing something wrong but, after carefully reading directions and watching the instructional videos not sure what it could be???Anyway, for those with dull knives and weak traditional sharpening voodoo, be warned, this might not be the answer."
4,Long time fan of this system,"I've been using Lansky's for at least 14 years. I love them. If you want a good sharp/safe knife this is the sharpner you want to use. If you have some good knives it is a must. I own a wide varity of sport and kitchen knives, Henckels Twin , Chicago Cutlery , Jimmy Lyle (the rambo knife maker) RIP Jimmey, Victronix, Kbar, Leatherman. It does a good job on all. The trick is to put the correct angle on the cut and to keep it. Using a stone. V shaped unit or a sharpening steel is not consistant. Also the better the knife is at holding an edge the harder it is to sharpen so this consistant angle is really important on them. If you can't or won't use a sharpening service this is a good alternative."
2,Totally overrated. Awkward system with mediocre results.,"I have over 30 knives of various steel and thickness, etc. The Lansky system is just a pain to use. Have tried it on most knives and was not pleased. The way the knives need to be clamped and then sharpened with those skinny stones attached with a wobbly wire is just no good. Usually you will either wind up cutting yourself or the whole contraption comes apart. If you simply want to get sharp knives without getting into the whole zen of sharpening (in which case i would suggest several japanese water stones) buy this: Messermeister 12-Inch Ceramic Rod Knife Sharpener."
5,Product works well for hot flashes....,I'm grateful for DIM because it really does take away my hot flashes which helps me to get a better nights sleep. But note that it most likely won't work overnight I suspect for most people. You have to give it a few days to a few weeks to kick in. For me DIM takes about a week and a half to start working again if I stop taking it for a while. Overall good product.
4,like it,I haven't been taking it long so I can't say much but so far I like it .. I will up date this when I find more out
5,Home town revisited,"I was born in Gloversville in the Nathan Littauer Hospital just as WW II was beginning. I lived on Franklin St. until I was 9 when we moved 30 miles away to Saratoga Springs. My father was a glove cutter, just like the ones described in the book. I visited his factory several times and can still see and smell the experience. Throughout high school I kept in touch with friends from Gloversville through youth group and school activities. This book is a wonderful description of the times and the history of the town and it truly catches the full flavor of the place and people. Many names I know from actual acquaintance or from conversations my parents had. I know the places mentioned. This book is well written and not at all academic in style and if you have any history with Gloversville you should enjoy it."
5,Much better book than I even hoped for,This book does not just tell the story of the Jews of Gloversville but gives great insight into the American Jewish experience. The writing is exquisite. The author's ability to express concisely some very complicated and subtle motivations of the waves of Jewish immigrants is a beautiful thing to behold. I expected a history of a community I shared for only 10 years but got much more than that. Having known some of the characters and even more of their decedents made this an exciting experience. This is a book that explains a lot.
4,Good beginning to the whole Charmed shebang.,"Despite being a play-by-play novel of the pilot episode, its still worth reading because on paper, you can feel, analyse and comprehend what the characters thought and felt. Its through this book that you can really understand what the sisters' reaction was when they found out about their extraordinary abilities and truths about themselves, and their tedious responsibilities. Gives you a clearer perspective of their powers and how they controlled them. Overall, a good book."
5,Charmed the Power of Three,"I enjoy Charmed, the Power of Three. I really recommend the book and this is why. Three sisters, Prue, Piper and Phoebe just discovered that they are witches. This all happened when Phoebe the youngest sister came back from New York. Only Piper, the middle sister knew that phoebe was coming. Prue got angry because no body told her Phoebe was coming. Phoebe went to the attic and read a spell out of the book of shadow. They received speacial powers. prue could move things with her mind, Piper can freeze time, and Phoebe can see the past. An eavil warlock wanted their powers, so he needed to kill them. The three sisters were trapped but they said a spell to destroy the warlock. You should read this book no matter what"
5,A Great Start To The Series Of Books That Lay Ahead,The power of three is a really good book. It gives you a more indepth and detailed look at how the charmed ones and it all started. It's a great book if you have just started watching the show and even if you have been watching it since the first episode aired.
4,good kick start,this is the first book in the series althogugh it mirrors the first episode completly. it introduces all the main characters well setting the scene well for how the sisters will cope with their new found witchiness. even if your not really into charmed but you do like wicca this is a great book!!!
3,"Charmed ""The Power of Three""","I love this episode of Charmed! I actually see the very first episode also. I have ALL of the Chamred books in my basement! I know that Phoebe went to the attic one day and went upstairs to find a ""spell"" book called ""The Book of Shadows"" that have all these neat spells that Phoebe Halliwell wne tupstairs to the attic to ""find"" a spell a book called a ""Book of Shadows"" that was inherit each generations from generations in the Halliwell family. The same day that Phoebe finds that same Book of Shadows in the attic, she reads a spell from the book the reveals the three spell that three witches know have....sorry, I can't tell you! You have to find out for yourself!"
3,The book lacked depth,The book lacked depth and feeling. Being a fan of the TV series naturally led me to read the associated writings. But the book mirrored the show perfectly except the author couldn't paint a clear picture. I couldn't picture myself there. As if I were reading a restatement of facts.
3,Charmed Fan Must-Read!,"This book followed the first episode very closely and even added a few insights into the characters of Prue, Piper, and Phoebe. It adds some different elements to their fanily histories also. I found it to be a little bit boring because it is based on the first episode and even some of the script can be pinpointed in the book. However, it is still a must-read for any and all Charmed Fans!"
3,A good beginning book,"I liked this book as it explained alot of things to me. It is the beginning book of the charmed series, the one where Prue, Piper and Phoebe Halliwell first find out they are witchs and they have to learn how to handle their differnt powers. I missed the first eposode myself so this book really helped me understand how it all began, and if you have never seen charmed you will still enjoy and understand this book and it will probably make you want to watch the tv series. This book has alot of detail in it and it is very funny in places where their powers get out of control. The author has been very effective so that you feel you are actually in the charators minds."
5,Charmed the power of three,"I enjoy reading Charmed the Power of three. I really recommend the book and this is why. Three sisters, Prue Piper and Phoebe just discovered that they are witches. This all happened when Phoebe the youngest sister came back from New York. Only Piper the middle sister knew that Phoebe was coming. Prue got angry because no body told her Phoebe was coming. Phoebe went to the attic and read a spell out of the book of shadow. They received there powers. Prue could move things with her mind, Piper can frees time, and Phoebe can see the past. An evil warlock wanted there powers so he needed to kill them. The three sisters were trapped but they said a spell to destroy the warlock. You should read this book no matter what."
3,Nice....but,"Nice, but plays right off of the pilot episode. This book is a mystical time portal for all those wanting to renew their memories of the sisters' first battle and wicca duties. Plus, there are moments in the book that help curve the pilot by adding snit-bits to the storyline."
4,Mysteries Unfold,"I watched the first episode when I was way too young to remember, I began watching it fanatically in the 4th season and I found this book in my next door neighbour's library. It is different in scenes, naturally, from the actual pilot, it was much, much better. When I watched the first episode after it, it didn't explain Roger well and Melinda Warren but the book explained it brilliantly. I reccomend this book for all Charmed fans, it is necessary for your collection."
3,Lukacs analyzes some concepts related to Hitler in history.,"All biographers agree on the basic facts of Hitler's life. The interpretive concepts, however, are sometimes foggy. This book usefully analyzes and clarifies many of these, referring in an opinionated way to the specific historians. Was Hitler mad? Was he a revolutionary? When did his views crystallize? Was he unrealistic in refusing to allow his armies to retreat? What did he mean by the ""Volk?"" Was he ""great?"" Some unintentional comic relief is provided by Lukacs's repeated use of the word ""fundament"" whenever he means ""foundation"" (Doesn't anybody at Random House/ Vintage own a dictionary?) He also confuses ""lupine"" and ""vulpine,"" for example."
2,"Pompous, Conservative, 1950's Style History","The author spends too much time trashing Marxism and telling us which biographers and writers are ""respectable"" in the eyes of him and his co-thinkers. One would never guess that Hitler's main support came from aristocrats, capitalists and the ""respectable"" middle class from reading this book. Lukaks' contention that Hitler was a revolutionary rather than a reactionary is utterly unconvincing. What kind of revolutionary sucks up to capitalists, generals and aristocrats, outlaws abortion, seeks and gains the support of the Catholic and Protestant churches, and smashes Marxist and Social Democratic movements? This book is a tired rehash of Cold War ideology."
2,"Wow, so not funny","The problem is mainly that these jokes are heavily outdated. Be very careful about using any of them. Use ""Look Inside"" feature to see that these jokes are just plain not funny."
4,Comforting Aroma,"I loved the smell of this tea but found the taste to be a bit to sickly sweet for me. I use little, if any, sweeteners in teas, so the sweet taste of this put me off! I have a friend who loves the sweetness, so this is going to be a matter of personal preference!"
4,"Relaxing, Refreshing Tea","I love anything decaff but I also like to taste the flavor of my tea. The tea bag does have to sitfor awhile but I usually nuke my tea so I think that helps bring out the flavor.I love honey vanilla and It helps that tea is good for blood pressure.This is an herbal tea and chamomile is said to be good for the stomach.At the end of the day, I love sitting down with a cup that won't jumpstart my nerves."
3,"Okay, but the vanilla or honey flavor seems a bit wonky","It's a nice tea, but the vanilla or honey (or maybe a combination of them both) leave it tasting a bit ""fake"" flavored, if you know what I mean. The plain chamomile from Celestial Seasonings is much better on it's own."
3,"Good Content, Bad format","I'm a big Cornelius fan. His album Point is one of my all time top 10 cds. Sensuous is a good album too. Not quite at Point's level, but enjoyable all the same. However, this CD and the replacement that Amazon has sent me has a formatting error between tracks 8 (Omstart) and 9 (Beep It) where the crossfade between tracks gets cut out and goes to silence for approx .5 seconds. This is really annoying. Since Amazon sells a few different versions of this CD online, I'll mention that the 2 sent to me are ""imports"" and were manufactured by the label ""EverLoving"" (note: ""Import"", as I am located in U.S.) I don't know if this same problem occurs with other label printings or versions of Sensuous. My overall rating of this CD is a 3 (i.e. 4 for Cornelius' tracks, 2 for formatting problem)."
2,Ay....ya....yay.....,"CORNELIUS is amazing, but Sensuous teases, yet does NOT please!I'm a huge fan of both Fantasma, Point, & his AMAZING live shows that are a MUST SEE....but unfortunately, this album fell flat on its face.A couple of good tracks, but too much gibberish noise and soul-less tracks.Honestly, don't they just sound like a bunch of B-Sides from point????Come on Keigo, I'll still buy the next album!;-("
3,Worth it to read,Bought this for my daughter and she never got into it.. It covers a great subject that all women can benefit from.
5,"Ya, dudes.","As book was for a friend, I have no knowledge of content, however great product, as advertized 'can't be told from new', good service. I definetly recommend this seller."
4,"Good service, good product","No complaints, sorry it took me so long to respond, it slipped my mind about doing a review."
1,Disappointed,"Terms were rarely defined and conditions were not differentiated from one another. Blame and victimization was pervasive. Very disappointed. Would suggest anyone looking into using this facility carefully assess credentials of people there, and compare it to others."
4,Attempting to resolve,I had not received the book order and sent a negative remark which I removed shortly after I posted it. I removed it because at this point Harry's Books responding so quickly to the matter and is helping to resolve my complaint. It may not be their fault.
5,Christian Coach Reviews Facing Codependency,"As a professional Christian Coach I am especially mindful of that which I encourage clients to read. Ms. Mellody provides sound insight into the world of codependency based upon solid clincal intervention. At Truth Coaching, we come along side of great people, who may be stuck at times. This book is a fantastic resource for those stuck in codependency."
5,An enlightening book!,"This book was recommended by my therapist. It opened my eyes to a few things I did not see before. It helps you put words and faces to things you see and experience. It is very enlightening and helpful!! I would highly recommend it for anyone. It helps you to see and understand codependency, and ways that it manifests in our lives and childhood. It gives examples of functional and the dysfunctional. I just got the workbook that goes along with it, and am currently working on it. I give it many kudos!"
5,Self-help book,Pia Melody is an awesome writer and very knowledged in this area.The person using this book is making wonderful progress due to theuse of this book.
5,this cassette is awesome.,this cassette will accelerate your healing. do not listen to it in the car at first because reality may scare you into a ditch. after a while leave the cassette in the car tape player and do not take it out.
2,Poorly written waste of time,"This book overwhelmed me with problems, but no solutions other than ordering more of Ms. Melody's books and workbooks (aside from therapy and support groups.). It is utter garbage."
4,How did codependence become such a catch all label?,How did codependence become such a catch all phrase? I got this book to get a better understanding of what codependence is. However this book is not about codependence. It is a book about the effects of growing up in a dysfunctional family system. If it didn't keep trying to lump everything under the codependent label I would have no problem with the book.Get Codependent No More instead. It is a much better book.
4,Personal Issue with Co-Dependence,"This book hits very close to home; I saw myself and my daughter all through it. Very helpful, and a bit depressing."
1,Worst product ever! Don't bother buying it!,"My daughter needed a replacement MP3 player and when the store did not have the one we wanted, she picked this one. It charged within 3 hrs like the directions said, then we loaded her songs, and within the first 15 minutes of play, the unit shut down and none of the buttons would work!! We tried to reset it but nothing happened. I tried to see if we needed to download the ""firmware"" from their website but the file format was something that I had to buy!! So my husband brought it back to the store, we got a replacement of the same item....went through the whole process and AGAIN the unit shut down! I then found some online reviews and basically, 9 of the 10 people gave it 1 star, and many had experienced the same problems!"
2,There must better MP3 players out there,"I'm new to this MP3 player game, but I've had this for 2 weeks and I still cannot really recommend it. First of all much the 4Gb memory is taken up by the 500 songs already added. It would be nice, but most of them are pretty weak. Eye of the beholder I suppose. Also, good luck finding accessories. Even amazon has no arm band or FM transmitters recommended. Portability should be the emphasis."
5,"FINALLY... a refreshing approach to Irish ballads, old & new","Powerful, intense, passionate...these words do no justice to this young man's love for his music and his Irish heritage. One does not simply..""listen""..to his music...rather,..it is an...""EXPERIENCE""...that you will not soon forget. Brendan's rendition of an old Irish favorite, ""Danny Boy"" will send chills up and down your back. The CD title song ""Atlantic Breeze"", an original, once discovered by the Irish Tourism Industry, will send this young man from the hills of Donegal to the hearts of Irish everywhere...as well as to those who wish they were...."
2,"No Notes,No Sources, Sadly Flawed","This is a fascinating story, it really is. But how much is true, how much is exaggerated, how much is down right false? The author left no way to verify what he reports, not even his own research notes. I personally believe the main theme of disappearing water supplies due to watering of thirsty high yield crops. But I certainly wouldn't use Pearce's specific facts without double checking them. Too bad, it is a very readable book with many possible insights. If his sources had been included this would easily be a 5+ book."
4,Interesting and thought provoking,"By now, many people have heard of the Aral Sea drying up or the Colorado River not making it to the ocean. However, this book is a good overview of many other issues people may not have heard about. The author seems to suggest that there could be enough water to go around, but that in order to make sure, we would have to change the way we go about doing a lot of things. The scariest part of the book is that large sections of highly populated countries may be living an unsustainable lifestyle with respect to water. What happens when the wells go dry? Whenever I read books about water, global warming, or oil supply, it makes me think that perhaps these are life and death issues that are put on the back burner by modern society. In any case, while this book may leave you wanting a little more, it'a very readable and informative."
5,A thorough and good read,"It's easy when writing about this topic to fill a book with facts and figures, and forget to tell a story that people can grasp.I've read many books on this topic, and this one is a book that I would share with someone who isn't familiar with the world's water issues since it flows so nicely.In this book, the author does a great job of providing stories from around the world that are symbolic of a growing problem. He hits the critical areas of aquifer drawdowns, dams and their real impact, and overuse of rivers, with the stories to go along with those issues, and of the impact and consequences of not addressing the issues at higher levels of society.Lots of stories that are thankfully brief, but to the point."
3,great deal!,"This tournament set is great! If you arenew to bdaman, you should buy this becauseit comes with a starter blaster and comes with6 bdaballs. Not to mention it also prepares you forall 10 games and comes with enough accesories.( or is it spelled accessories)"
5,this thing rox,I like this because there is a little shooter and I can use the sqeezer[the thing hold so it could shoot]and I could master my skills
3,beyb,i cant beleive i spent all my money on beyblades they are just stoopid spinnig tops.i cant what till i get this
1,Battle Bdaman Sucks!!!,I Agree with this guy that battle battle bdaman sucks. Beyblade Is Mutch Better than Battle Bdaman. So get off of Battle Bdaman and get on to Beyblades!
3,The First Bf109s to the early F's,"If you are interested in different colour schemes for the early Bf109's through to the first F versions, then this is the book for you. As always, colours are subject to personal interpretation as these are invariably translated from black and white photographs - but all in all, most profiles seem to be a sensible representation.The artwork may appear flat and does not reach levels of aviation artists like Richard J. Caruana. The perspective layout is also on the weak side, particularly the under-surfaces. The weathering effect can be annoying as it is done on a permanent layer and is repeated on every profile. There are certain elementary errors which could have been avoided, ex. E-1's should not have the undersurface cannon bulges...All in all however, the effort is commendable and the publication is in fact a good reference source if you want to choose a scheme for your models."
2,Osprey do it better !,"For a book based exclusively on a collection of aircraft profile drawings the artwork has to 'look right'; here it simply does'nt. A vast selection of Bf109s are illustrated but they all have a curious banana shaped fuselage and heavily shaded panel lines where none exist...there are no accompanying reference details and little in the way of photos. As the intro in the original French edition stated, this work was essentially cobbled together from a variety of well known English language sources and designed for non-English speaking enthusiasts. There seems ultimately little point in offering a translated edition...the bottom line... even Osprey does this sort of thing better..!!"
4,"Intriguing performance, poor audio quality","This is a very interesting and engaging video documentation of a live recording session, representing a fine and exotic artistic performance. Unfortunately the video quality is not great, and the audio quality on the DVD is very poor. It seems to have been captured from the microphones on the video cameras, rather than from the sound studio's recording system. There is however a companion CD available with much better sound. I would recommend buying the CD instead if you are most interested in listening."
4,Good Toolbox,"Nothing fancy about this toolbox, but it's roomy enough and has sturdy latches. The small-parts boxes that stay in the top with a friction fit have so far stayed in place. No complaints."
4,Great tool box,I love the size of this box. It is big enough to hold a good amount of stuff but still easy to carry. The storage in the lid is great for all those screws and clips I carry. Even holds my cordless drill. Be warned; not all drills will fit in here. I researched until I found this one that would hold my drill.
3,"Five stars for the toolbox, one star for the packing job","The box is big and feels sturdily made; exactly what I was looking for. However, it wasn't packed well and when it arrived one of the plastic bins on top had broken. I was able to fix it with some duct tape, but that's not ideal when you buy a new item, is it? This is the first problem I've had with Amazon and their packing, so hopefully it's an anomaly. Just letting you guys know."
4,Boy in Static? more like Joy Emphatic!,"sorry, that title was cheesey. but you know what isn't? this cd. that's right. it's a good one. if you like etherial computer blips and beats with a nice low key voice over it, then get this. radiohead of course paved the way for this type of music, but they paved a pretty wide street so a lot of people can add what they want to bring to this genre. don't expect to listen to this in the locker room before the big game to get you all pumped up. it's more like something you'd want to bring to an opium den or something. very relaxing music. it's good. just get it. you'll just waste your money on something else anyway. might as well have a good cd."
2,Made me laugh,"This book is a joke, it's not only bias, but it's incorrect. A lot of the ""facts"" in it, common sense and a quick Google search proves otherwise. They could still get water, just not the waste of the canal. and they would still get money, many of my rancher friends including myself know that is wasn't a big deal like how the media portrayed it. I give it two stars because it's written in English, and it's published."
5,As Great as I've Heard,"I've listened to the CD for awhile, which was very helpful when I received the music. I'm a beginner so some of the music is beyond me at present, but I truly enjoy playing several pieces. This is Exceptional music which people at all skill levels can enjoy. Thank you, Tina!"
4,pretty deep,"Stinky Stern is the 4th book in the Jackson Friends series. ""Stinky"" is the class bully. In art class he messes up Pa Lia Vang's snowflake on purpose. He is always doing mean things. Later that afternoon when school is out Stinky is involved in a terrible accident that leads to his death. Follow the students in room 201 as they learn to cope with the tragic death of a classmate.The book discussed the issues of bullies well. This book could lead to some great classroom discussions.Dealing with the death of a classmate can be really hard for young kids. This book could get them to talk about their feelings."
4,Remember,"I think Stinky Stern Forever is good because it teaches people many things and one thing is that even if you don't like somebody, you would still care about him if he got hurt or something.If you are really bad you will pay for it. Stinky Stern was so caught up in the snowflake he ruined that he didn't see the car that hit him.I like it because it's about a girl that really doesn't like him, but when he dies she's really sad, but she doesn't want anyone to know that. In the end, the class talk about him and she wrote pictures in her notebook about him and it makes her feel all right in the end. She remembers him by writing in her notebook.(...)"
1,"""Stinky Stein Forever""","Warning about ""Stinky Stein Forever"":This book may be upsetting for your child to read. Stinky Stein is a bully who dies in an accident. Please have your child read this notice before they read the book. This story made me very sad. Actually, I am still very sad about it because I think about how Stinky's parents felt to lose their son. I would not have read this book if I had known what it was about. If you still want to read the book, you could ask a parent or adult to read it with you. I am writing this because there is no warning on the cover of the book to warn young readers that the content might be upsetting. Readers are Leaders! Koa H. Age 7, 3rd grade"
3,"Good price, OK Quality",I bought this set at $39.99 as a gift to my friend. This knives set IS NOT made in Germany and NOT with lifetime warranty. It is made in China and with 10-years warranty. The knives were sharp but handles of the smaller knives may be too narrow to hold. No feedback from my friend yet...
4,Nintendo Wii Tomagotchi,My 8 year old daughter found this game for $3.50. My first thought was....it must be pretty crappy if it costs that little. But she really seems to be enjoying it. There are not too many Wii games that are interesting enough to hold her interest without being too difficult for her to play. She also bought Tomagotchi 2 (Corner store?) for the DS and LOVES that game.
3,"For a Mario Party knockoff, it's awesome!","I started looking online for Wii Mario Party and decided I just couldn't afford it. My sister has brought her's over quite a few times and we love to play it. Upon reading reviews and investigation Tamagotchi Party we decided to go that route. For the price and all things considered, its awesome. The kids love it, I guess I kinda enjoy it too.A few drawbacks, you don't all do the minigames together. All minigames are one player, and you don't do any after everyone's turn, you have to land on the space. The sound is a little annoying, we usually just turn on the stereo and mute it. There is no way to play with less than four players on the board. The computer can play but you always must have four players, so if you want to play by yourself it's slow.Like I said, if you are on a budget and like mario party, try it. It's pretty close as far as gameplay."
1,complete garbage!!!!,This game is a REALLY BAD mario party rip off! It really stinks do not buy it! It is totally NOT worth the money even a reduced price.
4,Relaxing Fun,"I'm 17 years old and I picked up this game from gamestop because A) When I was a kid I loved playing with tamagotchis and B) It was only like $5. It's obviously not a game for hardcore gamers or even for people using the wii as excersize... but if you're bored around the house or feeling lazy with your friends its a fun little game to play to keep yourself occupied. The point of the game is to win as many elections as you can, to become the next tamagotchi president. You do so by getting more popularity points than the other players which you earn by attending rallies, helping the community, and playing mini-games. I don't think it in any way implies that you need money to buy friends as some of the other reviewers have stated. It may not be the most exciting game in the world, but for a tamagotchi lover or someone who needs something to kill time and bordom sometimes, its great ^^"
4,Didn't realize this was the workbook,Bought this thinking it was the book (it's the workbook) but my daughter was thrilled (getting it as a Christmas present).
3,Review of Ramsey Book,"The book took longer to arrive than what I had anticipated. However, it did arrive within the allowable time frame and it is in good condition.In reading the book, I discovered that it was not what I had thought it would be. It appears to be an outline from a seminar and the pages look like bound pages from a standard copy machine. I found the information to be helpful, but nothing I had not heard before. Would have been better if there had been more depth or detail to each of the major points, rather than just an outline-style of presentation. This would be a good item to take along to a class or seminar. Plenty of folks may still find the information helpful, especially if they have never given any thought to financial responsibility."
3,Old but works,"This version was old, and was written in. I ended up getting a newer one when I joined FPU. Like I said, it worked for the time."
2,not as described,book was entirely filled out. Not a great purchase for a workbook. The post office had to put in plastic bag due to the packaging being ripped!!Not impressed!
5,Dave,"Awesome book,lots of good advice and ideas. It is really helping my family out. All of Dave Ramsey's books have been very helpful. We took the course at our church and it was very helpful."
1,Not worth the money.,I can sum up everything Dave Ramsey teaches in 3 words: Always Pay Cash!There. I just saved you at least $30.
4,It is classic and in a leagues of its own!!,PRT put a twist of conscious thought into rap/hip-hop and they actually made you contemplate much deeper issues than the typical rap music. It is too bad I cannot purchase this on amazon.com!!
4,360 degrees,"The initial recording of the conscious man's group, Poor Righteous Teachers, Holy Intellect sets the stage for each of the group's brilliant subsequent efforts. A definite classic, this album expands hip-hop mental state through 5 percent wisdom, positive mental energy, and pure funky msical sensibilities. Wise Intelligent, Culture Freedom, and Father Shaheed lift hip-hop to a conscious plateau enjoyed by only a few others in the current music industry. With hip-hop's meteoric financial success comes industry copycats, wannabees, and hangers-on. PRT flips the script on the trend 180 degrees, and is a must have for the mind, body, and spirit of any true hip-hop head. Check out Pure Poverty, Black Business, and New World Order."
5,A Great Book for Kids,This is a great book for kids with beautiful imagery of New York. It also tells an important story of paying attention to one's surroundings. I would reccommend for kids of all ages.
1,electrid chain saw,"Could not keep the chain from coming off the bar. Ended up buying a gas saw and discarding the electric one. Would not recommend, even for light duty projects."
4,a green place,a beautiful book fully loaded with ownership.good to hear the voice of maori in the world.
4,MADE IN HONG KONG,"THERE ARE SOME REAL GEMS ON THIS CD. ""THE POLICE TOLD ME"" AND ""MADE IN HONG KONG"" WOULD HAVE BEEN BIG HITS HAD BILLY NOT DIED. HE WAS THE BUDDY HOLLY OF THE 80'S."
3,Carnosine,"Amazon wanted me to review this item. But really, who notices on a short term basis whether vitamins are doing good or not? You use them because you know in the long run they will help you. This vitamin is supposed to be good for diabetes, so I take it as an insurance policy, to help contain the disease. I have always had good service from Amazon, so I will continue to do business with them."
4,"Simple Sounds, Lots of Soul","I have a preference for alternative music, but I love the richness of this cd's songs. I found Shadric's website on the net before coming here to order the cd. An interesting blend of old style country & bluesy twist. For a guy who's been around a long time, he sure has a fresh spirit. Simple sounds, lots of soul."
5,"Posivite, tuneful songs","In these positive, tuneful songs...life is an adventure and family is something to celebrate."
3,How Do I Listen to some tracks?,I read the review in Tricyle and I am intrigued but will not commit to anything until I can listen to some tracks first. How do I do this?
5,MST3K,One of the best shows on television. I'm so glad that Amazon has it featured on the instant watch. It makes me so happy.
1,Disaponted with the contents of the book,"The book was sent on time, but I was really disapointed with the contents of things you can make with Dino's. There are only a few. I could do better on my own making up things to do with Dino's. This book is just ok. Seems like it's more for children to make a science project, about 6th grade. I ordered it for my Grandaughter that is 3, and it's way to advanced for her to do the very few projects there are in the book."
4,Truly Intriguing!,"I'm not an avid reader, but I picked up this book and just couldn't put it down. Mrs. Sassoon puts a lot of details into her work. I usually get bored with books easily. If they don't literally keep me on the edge of my seat, I simply put it down and forget about it. There is something about the way she describes the beautiful landscapes and Mrs. Taylor's feelings and emotions throughout the book that made me realize there is such thing as a good book."
1,Horrible Book,This book is extremely unscientific and promotes inbreeding without ever once mentioning the disastrous consequences that often accompany such close breeding. The book is also flat out wrong on many topics.
5,For a hard-to-please man,"As always, Nautica is a great reliable brand name. Although slightly different then in the picture, I would say that it was like a navy heather color as appose to a solid, but great quality, My son will were it!"
1,"Worse than useless, don't buy it!","We went for a 5,8 gHz phone to avoid interference with our wireless network, and this is what we picked. Dialling on any handset only works if you stand stock still and within sight range of the base station. Voice reception is so bad in parts of the house we end up hanging up and calling back on our cellphones.We bought a Motorola when we got fed up. It works absolutely perfectly. Wish we'd gotten it to start with and not wasted time with this rubbish.PS - noticed a friend had the same model when visiting their house. Asked them how it was, and they had the same frustrations. It's just a badly made product."
1,DO not buy this phone!!,This Phone looked good from the start but then I pluged it in.- short range. Past 30 feet and the static starts.- If you hit redial and you are 20 to 30 feet away from the base it drops tones. you never know where you are calling.- call waiting will cause the phone to shut down- caller ID was slow to display- support was bad.I was able to return the phone after 80 days to Staples and picked up a Panasonic.
2,Nice unit if you could actually use all the handsets,"I was quite impressed until I hooked it up. While my son was on one handset I tried to turn on another so we could both talk on the phone ... the phone indicated ""CAN'T CONNECT"". After digging in the instructions I find that only one handset can be used at any given time. This phone is fine if you live alone in a big house, otherwise find a different unit!! There is no indication of this limitation on the box."
1,Wish we'd read these reviews first!,"If we'd read these reviews first, we'd never have bought these phones. We have endured every negative issue noted in the other reviews here--but no longer. We're returning them. The display is VERY dim and hard to read, caller ID frequently does not appear (yes, we do have caller ID, but for some reason, the feature works poorly on these phones). In addition, you cannot activate more than one handset at a time. Why is this?!? The only positive aspect to this would be the ability to carry on a phone conversation you don't want anyone listening in on. The only saving grace is the built-in answering system. We have had no problems with it."
3,Disappointing,"This phone set is not top of the market. The 5.8GHz technology is not digital. There is a 1-2 second delay when the person you are speaking to can't hear you when answering a call. This may be related to my internet phone service, but was not present in the 900MHz phone that I previously had. This phone set lacks several key features, like intercom between phones and room monitoring. Also the speed dial capacity is too small (20) numbers. There are better phones out there for a reasonable price."
1,A Waste of Money,"I agree totally with many of the previous reviewers. I bought this phone 5 months ago and already one of the handsets is not working. The lack of speakphone, no capability for handset to handset talk,and the poor volume control make this phone unusable. Get October's Consumer Reports for review."
2,vtech IA5874 cordless phone,"I am very dissapointed with this unit. It has a slow reaction time when answering the phone. Also, only one handset can be in use at any time. This may be common with this type of equipment and if so I was not aware of it. Even though the handsets are spread out around the house, another person can not pick up a different unit if the phone had been answered somewhere else in the house. A bad choice on my part."
2,Very Disappointed,"I'm disappointed with the Vtech IA5874 5.8GHz I purchased not just because of the sound quality or caller ID features but other ones that are important to me. Although the price was good the features are not. There is no mute or speaker for this phone, I haven't tried using the phone with multipule callers so I can't say if that feature is available for this model but not having mute when I'm yelling at my grands or a speaker when I need to perform other task is not sufficient. I'm returning the phone and the GE I bought to replace it after reading the reviews about it. I'll stick with Panasonic, AT&T,(I've had previously) and possibly Uniden since the reviews are good."
1,Fuzzy is all I can say.,"Received one call, the message he left was NOT audible. When we called him back, he said our greeting message was terrible as well. Had the phone for one day which was one day too long. Looking to get a Panasonic KX. Great reviews on it.Blessings to all."
2,poor handset sound,"This model has VERY POOR sound quality -- no one can hear me unless I yell into the phone.Have no options to replace phone since its functions are not included on all models. Purchased this phone because it had a particular function that was important to me (called ""announce only: where it gives callers a message/information but will not take a message, thus will not exhaust incoming message space while on long trips). Very few phones have this function and the handset to my previous VTech phone had broken."
1,Terrible product,"Owned this phone for little over a week when it stopped letting us dial out. Could hear a dial tone but the phone would say connecting, and then could not connect. Returned it and got a better phone, not worth the hassle even for the low price."
1,Vtech IA5874 Cordless Phone System,Very short range making it useless for the purpose it is sold. Remote phones have a MAXIMUM range of less than 30 ft in the same room. Less than 20ft if a wall seperates them. LED displays have several dead pixels. You have to guess at what it is displaying.
1,waste of money,"The Vtech falls down on a very basic point -- no one can hear what I'm saying on the other end. The lack of options (no mute button, so speakerphone) are obvious when you purchase this phone, but its poor quality in delivering sound is apparent only after many ""can you repeat that?"" ""I'm sorry, I can't hear you"" ""Can you speak up?"""
4,Excellent product and a problem solver,When traveling without a computer this product is a nice way to store videos and pictures without having to carry numerous sd cards. I find it very handy.
1,Lost Many Many Photos,"I just returned from Machu Pichhu, the trip of a lifetime where downloaded my photos daily with the Digital Foci's battery fully charged. The problem with the unit is that it turns off at 30 sec. and if you're not alert (not multi-tasking) it will turn off before you have confirmation that all photos have been copied. I once downloaded my photos twice and although it indicated 100% copied, there was an entire day of photos missing.Avoid this product unless you don't mind losing photos.Customer service did answer some questions in regard to my loss and why it happened, however, I followed these suggested procedures while downloading and I still lost photos. They also indicated that their new model does not automatically shut off if the copy is not 100% - seems that feedback on the new unit is also negative."
2,"Good idea, poor execution","I had a similar experience to user IIB ""Kula"". In fact, I even took mine to Machu Picchu too.The UI is overambitious. It only needs one button in my opinion -- ""save my stuff."" Instead, they put a ""delete my card"" function in that has no confirmation, so I accidentally deleted a day worth of photos. I also had one card not copy for some unknown reason. Note I only ever used the unit while plugged into wall power, so it was not a battery problem. Finally, when I got home the unit had turned itself on and was frozen. I ended up disassembling it while it was running so I could unplug the battery, wondering if I was about to destroy two weeks worth of photos. It turned out OK, but was very nerve wracking.It's a good idea, and I want to like it but it has some fatal flaws. If you do end up using one of these, be sure to slide the ""read only"" lock on your cards before putting them in."
2,worked 'once',"I was very pleased the first time I used it with an SD card, but the second time I tried to insert my CF card and it would not go in...then I saw that one of the contacts in the middle was bent. So now, the whole reason I bought the device is not possible. I am NOT a novice and as a professional photographer I am very careful when inserting CF cards. What now?"
1,False advertising - these are Chinese knives,"I don't know if these knives are any good, as I bought them as a wedding present. But the ad is false. The ad clearly states that they are made in Germany and have a lifetime warranty. The box clearly states that they are made in China and they have a 10 year warranty. I have complained to Amazon, yet they haven't corrected their ad. They seem relatively well-made, but they aren't what is being advertised."
3,You get what you pay for - absolutely no match for anything resembling a factory finish blueing job,"I purchased this out of curiosity to see if it could even come close to a factory blueing job - it obviously didn't. Remember that age old adage, ""you get what you pay for,"" as it holds true here. It is find for average to below average blueing jobs, but don't expect your firearms to look balanced and thoroughly after using this. A waste of money for me, but it may serve someone else just fine."
5,Authentic New Orleans: Perfect Recipes from Private Cooks!,"This, my most treasured cook book, was a gift from my beloved New Orleans mother-in-law in 1972, the year I began law school at Tulane. I know for a fact the Garden District and Uptown Junior Leaguers submitted these recipes from their fantastic family cooks and from the ""back room"" at Antoines. With these can't- fail recipes, you can prepare incomparably authentic and delicious New Orleans cuisine. I live in California now, and last night I did the Plantation Cookbook's extraordinary crayfish etouffe' with whole, frozen crayfish I found at Ikea of all places!"
5,Best Cookbook Ever,Every single recipe in here is perfect. I have made about 95% of the dishes and if you follow the recipe exactly your dinner party will be a smash!
2,A propaganda piece with a righteous message from 1939.,"The vhs copy I had only contained Beast. This reprint was so poor as to be distracting. Sound, production & lighting were terrible. Pre-war anti-Nazis resisters are betrayed & interred in a concentration camp where they endure beatings & interrogation. Acting leaves something to be desired but it is an early Alan Ladd effort with noble subject manner. It is drama but has a few documentary scenes of Hitler & the Nazis dropped in. The story itself has a happy ending for one of the prisoners & his wife. That quickly dissolves into early scenes of World War II. Madacy Music Group in Canada did a poor reprint job. If the material they had to work with was so poor they needn't have bothered."
2,Price Guide to Costume Jewelry,Not for the beginner or if you are looking for to identify the less expensive pieces.
2,A lot of information but hard to appreciate pictures.,"I found this book to have a lot of interesting information. It included more practical advice on the cleaning,repairing and care of jewelry than most books do. The problem I had with this book is that most of the pictures were black and white. On costume jewelry examples, it loses so much when it doesn't show their color! The beautiful color ranges are the main reason I collect costume jewelry. The small colored picture section was nice. I just would have liked to see all of the pictures look this way. I also didn't like when several examples were shown as a group with a price range that served for all of them. Which price went with which pin?"
2,Not so good..........,I loved BR movie and would tell all my friends about it. But this....This is crap. For some reason I just had to read the first 3 books but now I have officialy stoped reading. The character development is very good but one thing that keeps this from being good. ITS WAY TO GRAPHIC FOR ITS TASTE! I know it says Mature on the back but still jeez! I mean you see some much brains and intestince get shot or pulled out. For an example Shuyas orphin brother gets shot in the cheek and you see a graphic picture of him laying on the ground with a huge whole with his tung sticking out. And than the teacher finishes him off by shooting him between the eyes. Its extreamly violent. And when you get to the last chapter on this lets just say if your into Hardcore Pornagraphy than you'll like this. This book went waaay overboard. But its in your taste what you like. All I know Is I've stoped.The novel and Movie is really good!BATTLE ROYALE 2 was not that good.Later.........
2,A couple nice points but it cutesiness becomes boring,"The writer attempts to write in a cutesy tone - probably in the name of being entertaining - but because he tries too hard the writing just becomes boring.This book reads like a series of columns about data warehousing. Most of the discussions are okay but somewhat on the superficial side. The author is at his best when he discusses the people side of data warehousing - especially the political issues.If you do not want to get deeply involved in the technical aspects of the subject, W.H. Inmon and Vidette Poe provide more easily read and more penetrating introductions to data warehousing."
3,"Good foundation, but getting rapidly obsolete","I enjoyed reading this book and found it an excellent foundation to issues in data warehousing. However, note that this book was published in 1997, so it does not include anything that was developed after that date. (To be fair, it accurately predicts some trends.) I wish the author would update the book to 2004!"
1,Dada Warehousing for Dummies?,"No typo here. The whole book can be reduced to 10 pages of somewhat useful information. The rest is boring, repetitive verbiage."
5,A Miracle,"This is required listening for every commander and every staff officer, and for every intelligence professional, both at the entry-level and at mid-career. Two things really hit home from this album: 1) the fact that we were completely clueless about the physical, mental, and cultural toughness and dedication of the Vietnamese who opposed our interference in Viet-Nam; 2) the fact that we are completely unable to detect tunnels under our base camps or in the tactical environment (although new technology is coming along). They dug 200 miles of tunnels by hand, including extensive networks under the major Bien Hoa complex. Enjoy!"
1,Rip off,THis game is an exact copy of the PC storybook i suggest you save your money and get the story book for your pc which runs smoother and faster
4,Disregard the other review...,"The other reviewer here is writing about the Russian import version of the CD, not the mp3s on sale here. I just bought these tracks and the sound quality is great! The songs are classic Giorgio Moroder circa 1979 so if you like ""Bad Girls"" and his ""E=MC2"" CDs from that year, you'll like this. Thanks to Rhino for putting out these great CDs in mp3 format."
1,Misleading title -- NOT a halloween dvd,"I had been looking forward to this dvd for my daughter because we believed it to be a Halloween dvd for the ""My Friends Tigger & Pooh"" series. I'm very disappointed in Disney for this. Not only does it mislead with the title ""Hundred Acre Wood Haunt"" but the cover makes it look like a Halloween DVD as well because of the darkness and the pumpkins everywhere. This is nothing but a copy of previously seen episodes. The ONLY Halloween episode on here is not even Tigger and Pooh! It's a Handy Manny ""bonus"" episode! Whether or not the contents of this dvd are listed on the back, this whole release was deliberately misleading and I'm very disappointed. I will definitely scrutinize my future dvd purchases in the future instead of being enthusiastic about having another Disney to add to our collection."
2,Disappointed,"My son saw this and was so excited to get it- he thought it would be a new movie like the Super Sleuth Christmas Movie DVD was. However, this is just a DVD of some of the regular episodes off the TV show. I believe there was only 1 episode he hadn't seen on here. He was very disappointed.I admit I should have read the back of the DVD better- it does state specifically which 6 episodes are on here."
4,More TV Episodes,"This is more My Friends Tigger & Pooh TV episodes (3 episodes/6 stories) put to DVD, although I hadn't seem them all before. And like I've stated before, the title has NOTHING to do with what is on them. There is little Halloween-related on this disc. The episodes are: Super-Sized Darby/Piglet's Lightning Frightening; Eeyore's Trip to the Moon/The Incredible Shrinking Roo; and Eeyore's Home Sweet Home/Rabbit's Prized Pumpkin. Bonus Feature is a Handy Manny Halloween Episode: Halloween/Squeeze's Magic Show. Hmm, OK, so the bonus feature is halloween-themed. And most of these videos have some sort of game or something on them as well. If your child likes My Fried Tigger & Pooh on Disney Channel, he/she will like this DVD."
4,Product arrived quickly & daughter loves it,"Bought this used as a surprise for my 3 year old. We'd borrowed it from the library before and she loved it. Cute stories and it makes her happy. It is nice to have a fun, smart, inquisitive girl in the Pooh movies. Girls need good role models, too, and my daughter was happy to see a girl in the films."
3,Too Scary for my little one,"My 5-year old daughter likes this movie. She said it's scary, but she likes scary. My 3-year old son, however, kept leaving the room, so we finally ended up turning it off to resume when he was asleep. A little too scary for my 3-year old, but I'm sure he will enjoy it later."
1,Not buying,"My DVR has these all. It is a waste of money to buy this DVD. I would buy a ""first season"" package, but not this. Disney greed is yet again in the way of customer satisfaction."
4,RUN DMC IS BACK AGAIN,"This group is definitely hot. RUN DMC should be inducted into the ""hip hop hall of fame"", no doubt. I been listening to Run DMC for years (even before the Krush Groove Era). These fellas has not lost their hip hop edge. Hard Core beats and tossed lyrics was always a hit and Run DMC mastered that part of the RAP GAME. Eventhough, It's been a while since their last recording Run DMC is still my favorite. ""The KINGS FROM QUEENS"" is still hotter than ever."
4,Underated Bouncy Grooves,"Though ""Back from Hell"" was released in the midst of the rise of commercial hip-hop and gangsta rap, Run-DMC still came through with a fun album that stood apart from the trends of the day. Telling tales of the city and throwing in some party-like anthems, the group put itself in between people like Hammer and NWA, not to be safe, but to keep making rap music the way they meant it to be. Looping some great grooves and adding in some funky keys, You can't help but enjoying this record after a few listens. Run and D still shine through with their mc abilities, just as they did with King of rock, Raisin' and Tougher than leather. This album seemed to close one chapter of their career, in a stylistic sense, but as the title says, also opens a new chapter for the 3 originals."
3,Definitely a cool album. Peep the skills!!,"""THE AVE"" is definitely a head-rocker, my favorite joint on the album. Slept on by fans even more than Tougher than Leather, but deserves a listen, even if only as an alternative to the often trite product coming out today..."
5,Heiwa Peace Poetry in English and Japanese,"Poets from around the world come together in this 160-page book devoted to peace. Short prose, haiku and tanka by veterass, soldiers and others confirms the message of peace. A gentle and recommended read."
2,Cheap construction,"The night lights is exactly what it looks like. Unfortunately, the light did not work. The Snoopy/Woodstock plate is very nice but the construction of the nightlight itself is very cheap. In fact, mine did not work. I am hoping to buy another $1 nightlight at Target and seeing if I can clip on the face plate to it. Would I recommend? Depends if I can clip the face plate to another light---"
5,Cute,I purchased this last year for my son's nursery. Now at 11 months he loves to touch watch Snoopy.
2,TEDIOUS CLEAN-UP!!!,"The pan worked fine. However, I'm glad I didn't follow the baking instructions to fill the pan 1/3 full. I filled it 2/3 full and the cakes came out perfectly. The horrible part about this pan is cleaning it. Even though I soaked the pan immediately upon removing the cakes; it was a very tedious process to clean it. I will think twice before using it again. Trying to get into each cake cavity and work around the center spindles, which are not removable, was frustrating and time consuming. I plan to look for something else that has removable bases/spindles."
1,Mini angel food cake pan,This is the worst pan I have ever purchased. In fact I returned it. The cake sticks to the pan & cleaning it took a great deal of time. Don't waste your time or money on this pan.
3,Weak!,"Very nice netting, as long as you don't pull too hard to wrap around cage, tears very easy!Garbage can is new home.Good thing I purchased 2 of them.Will treat this one with TLC!You get what you pay for!"
1,This is not what you think,"Was very disappointed with this purchase. No where did the product description say that the songs on this CD were redone, not the orignals. On the CD there are only two original songs, by the original artists. This was a waste of my money and has made me very wary of purchasing these type of cd on this site."
4,Good quality product,I bought this to go in the back of my ATT U-verse set-top-box so I could plug in wireless headphones. Sound quality is good. Great product.
4,Not shielded,This cable does the job. Too bad it isn't shielded. You might pickup a humm or a buzz depending on what you are connecting to.
4,3.5mm Female to 2RCA Male Cable,"Good cable. I have had no shorts or cut ins and outs with it... then again it does not see much daylight or movement. For the price you cannot beat it. Cables are overpriced if you ask me. You probably feel the same, if you are purchasing cables off Amazon as well. It serves it's function well!"
3,Why buy when you can build,I was going to buy one of these adapters to save myself some time. I have been making my own adapters from female jacks I had laying around and then cutting 1 RCA cable in half. Big deal both RCA plugs are the same color. I have already made 3 of these at basically no cost to me. I made two for the school I work at and one for a friend who uses a DVD player through a projector. Just add a cheap pair of computer speakers.
5,Great Product,"I was looking for a way to hook up my PC speakers to my flat screen, and this worked perfectly. As per usual, the order right on time. NICEEEEEEE."
3,JUST INCREASED TO FIVE STARS,"Great product for tv's without headphone jacks (but which have the standard red/white audio outputs).I live in an apt. and like to watch tv loudly in the middle of the night without disturbing my sleeping neighbors. Gave 3 star rating because this adapter would not work with my old tv, as it HAD NO AUDIO OUTPUTS. The old TV used the audible speakers only so this adapter could only be used with the DVD player using the audio outputs).UPDATE !!! Since replacing the old tv with the newly released Vizio 32 inch plasma, I am able to watch full cable, as well as, the DVD via my headphones. I highly recommend using inline sound adjustable headphones, as the sound is NOT adjustable via your tv or DVD remotes."
2,It doesn't work,"I may be using it wrong (Sound from 3.5mm wanting to be output to RCA), but this cable is not working for me."
1,received wrong item,"The package said it as 3.5 Female to RCA Mail Y cable, but I received a 3.5 Male to two 3.5 females.Sad for me since I needed this cable to use the item I ordered."
2,broke too easily,"Prong broke off as I was removing the jack, didn't even get to use it. Luckely I was able to get the prong out of the jack. This is cheap junk and I do not recommend it."
1,Wrong Item,They are obviously shipping the wrong item. I received a 3.5mm Male split to 3.5mm Female cable. Not even close to the description and not even close to the picture. I would not purchase this item without checking with Amazon first. I thought it would be corrected from the previous reviews because the seller was different. I was wrong. The package was labled correctly with the same description as on here but the contents were wrong.
1,Defective cable,This cable is cheaply made and mine has a short in the mini end. It will work if for a moment if it is held in just the right position with my headphone only partly into the mini end. Totally impossible to use. Return costs $5.50 so I'll be tossing this in the garbage where it belongs. I'll be shopping at Monoprice for a replacement (this came from MarginMart).
1,"defective item received, not replaced","In defense of both the item and the seller, I admit this is an unusual situation. But here are the facts, draw your own conclusion. I ordered one of these and had it delivered to my brother-in-law, who lives 3000 miles away. He's not electronics-savvy, and didn't realize he could use this to output his Roku to a pair of powered computer speakers. He called me and told me ""I just can't get any volume out of this set-up."" He finally sent me the Y-splitter, since he wasn't going to use it. It turns out that it has an internal short, and barely puts out anything except a loud buzz. Now, any cable like this can have a manufacturing defect, so that's forgivable. But I contacted the seller, CMPLE, and explained the situation to them, no response. Yes, it's been six months, but I think they should have at least responded."
3,Fine....except for the obvious deception.,"There is nothing 'wrong' with this product. In fact, it works and does exactly what it says it will. HOWEVER, the product picture clearly shows the cable with GOLD connectors. Anyone who knows about analog signals, knows that GOLD connectors are better quality than NICKEL connectors as they conduct electricity better and eliminate annoying feedback. The product you receive is NICKEL plated, not GOLD plated (as in the picture). And there lies the deceit. Of course, for only $4, the cable is still a good deal, its just not what the picture shows."
5,Great,I had no problems with this cable. I used it for audio from my laptop to my TV to watch movies.
3,The volume goes in different situation,I decide to buy this product because most of the HD LCD tv don't have the headphone jack input. I discovered that this product will make it work for the headphone jack to plug in the audio output. Only one problem is the volume. I tired to turn the volume up all the way to 80 and it was loud enough but it wasn't suppose to be that way. It should be 30 to 40 to be loud enough so I don't know why it does like that. I decide to deal with it. This might or not be satisfy for anyone who are please with volume. For this product.
4,Very handy to own,This is very nice to own as I can just plug it into my tv and listen through some nice headphones for aroudn 50 dollars instead of buying specific tv headphones for about 100-200 dollars so this saved me a lot of money!
4,TV Audio to PC Speakers,"This connector does exactly what it wanted it for, to connect the stereo audio outputs of my TV to a set of inexpensive PC speakers. The built in TV speakers exhibited a lot of distortion when watching DVD movies. The $40 three piece speaker system, left, right and sub woofer nicely solves this problem. I power off the external speakers when watching standard TV shows. They are unnecessary and the lack of remote volume control is an inconvenience.The connector construction is light weight. It is not designed for high power applications and I doubt it would hold up well in applications that require frequent plugging, unplugging or cable flexing. It works just fine in my hookup once and leave alone forever use.Jim McGrath"
3,Its okay,"I really did not used it that much. The product was okay I think because everything time I plugged my speaker to it, the sounds are just not right. I don't know if its my speaker or the cable. So its okay."
5,Worked as expected,I bought these to hook up a set of headphones to my older TV for late night viewing. I plugged then into my TV's audio out and they didn't work at the beginning. Since I have a digital cable box I decided to plug these in the audio out on it and it worked perfectly. I'm not sure if they will work with the audio out on your TV unless you have a menu option but if your cable box has audio out they will work fine.
5,Yeah Im glad Such A Great Movie Is On A Video Game!,"I Can not wait for this game or movie to come out!I wish they had the plot of the game or pics,but i know itll be great!"
5,ESSENTIAL HIP HOP FOR THE TRUE FAN AT HEART,"this is raw, authentic hip here. man, this made me want to get a high top fade and some ewings or something. my head would not stop noddin'. love the PRT collaboration on here. my joint on here though is BE BLACK. i wish that today's hip hop was more like this in the modern sense. today, there is too much emphasis on the material. this takes me back to that conscious era when cats were saying something to reach, teach, and uplift!!!!"
4,"meant for Brazilians, not those learning Brazilian","I find the book useful, but I wish there were a similar book written for those wanting to learn Brazilian, not Brazilians wanting to learn English. I can use it for my needs, but I am still somewhat frustrated at times. It gives the Brazilian word and the English word for each item, but it gives suggestions to Brazilians about our culture, not the other way around."
4,The Nine Numbers of the Cosomos,"Great! A new book for the course I'm teaching on Glorious Accidents. Rowan-Robinson includes photos, plots and data that add a reality note to pretty abstract stuff. He describes complex issues in words that are usually clear and non-technical, but sometimes mathematically oriented. My artistic and non-tech students would have a hard time with about 1/4 of the book, so I suggest limited portions and supplement this book with chapters from others: ""Just Six Numbers"" by Rees; ""The Five Ages of the Universe"" by Adams and Laughlin; ""The Origins of Life"" by Smith; and brief readings from Theilhard and Zen (theology), Hawking (physics) and Mayr (biology). It all makes for a stimulating experience for us all."
1,Don't buy this book,"This book did absolutely nothing for me. If you can get through all the typos and misinformation, you may pick up some general information, but it didn't help me accomplish anything."
1,Samsara Eau de Parfum,"I am completely dissatisfied w/the product I received from this vendor through Amazon.com. I have purchased this exact product many times both in the States and in Europe while living in England.The scent completely dissipates after about 20-30 minutes. I suspect I was sent the Eau de Toilette, which contains more alcohol and dissipates more quickly than the Eau de Parfum, which I ordered and is more expensive.I have done business w/Amazon.com for years and never bought anything that I wanted to return and get a refund for until now."
2,Samsara Eau De Parfum Spray 3.4 Ounces,"I have worn Samsara since 1995, and this bottle, even though it looks as if it is the real item, does NOT have the same wonderful fragrance as my previous bottles, AND the fragrance disappears quickly. My previous bottle, Eau De Toilette,which is almost empty is much MUCH better. It is as if the manufacturers have really DILUTED DOWN the product. It's a shame I paid so much for the Eau De PARFUM, maybe I should have bought the much cheaper Eau De TOILETTE, like my previous bottle. Totally Disappointed."
1,Very Sad One Star Is TOO many,"I drown myself in this before I leave the house in the morning. The sent is gone by Noon or earlier. I went to the mall and sprayed ""the real thing"" and the sent lingered through the night.Why I didn't read reviews before purchasing???? I can't even return due to shipping flamable restrictions.Don't be fooled. This was a waste of my money!"
2,Where's the fragrance,"Fragrance doesn't last long. I even tried ""over doing"" it, and it was still difficult to smell. If I had known this I would have spent my money on something I KNEW lasted."
3,Could be better,"I was given this as a gift for Christmas the bottle is very lovey a deep and sensuous ruby red color with gold accents, it looks very elegant.This is my first time ever using Samsara the scent when it first goes on is very very very strong, it does mellow out significantly through out the days to a more powerdery soft smell."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!,"I should have listened to the other reviewers! I have wore Samsara for over 15 years. Though I received a real Samsara bottle, the fragrance is not like the real Samsara. The fragrance only lasts a few minutes unlike the real Samsara that lasts for hours. Do not waste your money!"
4,Beautiful & Classic,"It opens a bit green & citrus, and moves to the ylang ylang before heading straight for business ... powder, violet, powder, rose, powder, orris. Did I say powder? The powder is at the perfect level - not in your face or stiffling. However, the powder is there, changing and morphing, coming to the front, moving to the back, and teasing the senses. It's a changeable powder that is a powder lover's dream. It dries to a powdery, vanilla, tonka bean, amber on me.Samsara is not an 1980s powerhouse. It's an oriental woody at its finest. Ironically, it seems fresh & unique after the onslaught of edible, aquatic, and happy scents of the last 20 years. I've got the office-appropriate EdT, which is soft and close-wearing - very samsara. I will be adding the EdP to my wardrobe soon. I love it!"
3,not so pleased,"i wasn't sure if i was using this correctly as it left my hair incredibly tangled. i apply it after the Nisim shampoo and leave it in for 30 sec (recommended) - 1 minute, but still tangled. hair feels frizzy. However, this product does not leave my hair with a heavy, greasy feeling. i have oily hair but this products keeps the oiliness away for as long as 2 days at a time."
4,You can't go wrong,"Finally a Flash book that takes the reader step by step through the creation and production process. Although it won't win any literary awards, it does deliver on what it promises in the title. Too many computer books and tutorials found on the internet give some but not all of the information needed to successfully create an actual application from start to finish. This no-nonsense book should really be called a Flash 5 ""Cook-Book"". Why? If you just follow the detailed steps outlined by the author, you will end up with something beautiful to behold. I also liked the CD that ships with the book. It has an awesome interface, and entertains the reader while making it easy to find everything you need quickly.A must have for Flash users"
1,"Not recommended, even for beginners","This book has 21 example flash movies and how to make them. It is not a book to learn the basics of flash, just examples. Each of the 21 chapters/examples are so wordy I kid you not, it took 21 lines just to describe how to copy frames from one movie to another. Superbly wordy. If feel the authors were definately trying to fill in space with words or they are totaly undermining the intelligence of their readers. (Epic (the authors) you need to fix this, it's was most annoying). Secondly, the examples were way too simple and not did not progress throughout the book. Many of them were not much different from each other (come on, not fair!) Even as a beginner they were too simple. For the cost of this glossy paged book it was definately not worth it at all. (Epic, your gonna need sleeker, more advanced examples that are really up to par with the Flash world and please, please streamline your verbage times two)."
1,Old content in this book!,"The samples in this book look great! It has the best graphics I've seen in any Flash book. Unfortunately that's where the book stops being good. The book seems to be missing the ""Meat"". All the samples are very simple; some are rewrites of what comes with the actual program(ie: calculator, and drag and drop game). I actually regret buying this book, next time I will read the first chapter of a book before buying it. You can't judge a book by it's cover, or the graphics inside! Hope this review helps anyone trying to decide what book to buy."
1,I'd rate it below one star if I could...,"Look, I've been researching Flash inside and out. I bought this book, but now I'm beginning to wonder why. This book if anything shows you how to assemble projects, nothing more. The actionscripting in this book is still Flash 4 based. Heck, if you goto the author's website to download any of the 'extra' examples that he mentions in the book, there's a nice little note stating that he'll email the examples to you, but for flash actionscripting advice you're better off elsewhere."
4,Ellen Rosner Rocks!,"I've seen Ellen many times live and she puts on an energetic show. It's wonderful to know that all that spirit was captured on her new CD. Listening to her words she not only understands how you feel, but knows how to sing it out with attitude. She's not timid in her playing, she's aggressive and it's such a treat to her with a band. Definitely worth trying if you're a Joan Armitrading fan, Ellen does her idol great homage. This artist is one to keep your eyes on for making a wave in the music world."
3,A bit of a tough read,"OK ... there is some good information in this book. However, it is not a lite read. You really have to be interested in the history of the Carolinas and in Cherokee history to make it through this book."
3,Not too helpful,"It is always a pleasure to watch a young Nicklaus playing. For beginners, this DVD is good, in order to understand the mechanics of golf. However it is too basic and he makes look everything so easy when it is not, which can lead into troubles for the inexperienced. There are a few tips that can help your golf indeed, but does not worth paying for this. There are better sources - free - in internet. In the other hand, the visual resources are very - very poor, which perhaps in understandable since this was recorded in the 80's (hey, that is 30 years ago...!). Instead, buy the Tom Watson's DVD, which is way better in quality, visual resources with different cameras and approaches, as well as very and well detailed explanations"
1,"Great service, item was not as pictured and low quality","Great service, item was not as pictured and low quality. Fast refund when returned, but it cost me $10.00 total shipping and for that I qot zip."
1,Waste of money,"I love Patsy Cline, but this was not a good choice for me. The Kindle download had problems (some of the names of those who were reminiscing were absent or blurred). This book consisted of a few anecdotes. Period. Good to borrow from a library, but not good enough to pay for."
4,Great carseat!,"This is our second Boulevard model carseat and we love both of them. My only complaint is it's hard to get it centered/level in the back seat when it is rear facing (I have a 04 camry and my husband a 06 corolla). The tether wants to pull it to one side or the other. We also had to pull out the back support pillow in order to get the latches to click without cutting off the circulation in our daughter's legs. But the cover is very luxurious - more so than you can see from the picture. I was holding out for the Shannon cover but Britax kept pushing the release date back, and I needed to get a seat quickly as my daughter was outgrowing her infant seat. I was very, very happy when I saw how pretty the cover is.Other than the asthetics of the seat, it seems very solid and safe, and I am very comfortable knowing that it is keeping my daughter safe and secure when we are driving!"
3,Crotch Strap NOT adjustable,"I bought this seat for my 4 year old so I could have him in a harness longer than his other seat that went to 40lbs. This is a nice seat and we loved the side impact protection. Unfortunately, when we put him in the seat his sat on top of the crotch strap instead of it being in front of him. So, in other words, his "" jewels"" we crushed when we tried to buckle it. Needless to say, he kept saying ""TOO TIGHT, MOMMY!"" I'm returning the seat tomorrow. Try your child in this before you buy. The decathlon does have a 3 position crotch strap, the marathon and roundabout do not, but there's more room in those compared to the boulevard."
5,SHAMROCKED ROCKS THE BOOKSTORE,"It was great to find this book on the recommended titles table in my favorite little bookstore!First of all, I love the title. Second of all, I love the girl named Cassie who is having all her adventures up there at Shasta.Cassie is definately a character to root for!The writing is lean. Universal emotions play through the book.Your kids will love it. They will really be able to root for Cassie!"
3,Not as much fun as I expected,I bought this game because I enjoyed it so much on my i-phone. It was not really like the phone version. I haven't even played it much because I was so disappointed with it.
3,"Fun game, but gets old fast.","I bought this game because Zuma is not yet available on DS and I love playing it (Zuma) on my Ipod. Luxor is very well designed - the screens are very pretty and the music and sound effects are excellent complements to the game play. But like Magnetica, it gets boring after a while. it could be because I have it set to medium difficulty and of the first 70 or so levels I have only lost two times... and it seems like you get TONS of power ups and electrical storms so there isn't much of a challenge... I'll bump up the difficulty level one of these days, but for now, it is fun to play but it is not something I think I will play forever like Tetris or Battleship..."
3,Lack Luster,"It's sad that this is the only version of Auralia that's available for Mac. This editions is VERY old and is low on features. The few features that it does have can easily be found somewhere else. The ancient interface is appropriate for the overall feel of the program. I have been studying ear-training for 2+ years and have found more effective, and easier to use features everywhere else for little or no money.For starters, www.musictheory.net offers a wonderful flash program that can do intervals and chords, melodic and harmonic. It even offers and offline download. As for melodic/rhythmic dictaion, just google something. You can at least find a program for less than this one."

5,Outstanding Collection of Harp Music!!,"I heard one song from this cd on the radio and had to buy it! The music is simply fabulous! I highly recommend this collection to anyone who enjoys harp music or just enjoys listening to relaxing, uplifting music in general."
4,"Soothing, and not sappy",This is a beutiful collection. The music make you feel like the breezy sunny afternnon of the New England.
1,Magnet is not strong enough,"I never got around to testing the performance of this antenna, as the magnet is far to weak to hold it onto the car properly. My other mag mount antennas are strong, but this moves with the slightest tap. It might be good for 30mph, but I wouldn't trust it to go any faster."
2,Junk,"This antenna is terrible. Do not waste your money, put it towards a better antenna. RX can occasionally be mediocre, within maybe 3 miles, but don't expect to be heard with this thing. You get what you pay for..."
5,sounding better than ever,"i love this record. i love the fact that you can hear your favorite songs done in an entirely new light. i've always loved 80's music. and i've always loved acoustic songs. so naturally this was a no brainer for me. certainly it doesn't disappoint. the berlin track is my favorite. up tempo, fast moving, and acoustic! the men at work track is also great. an amazing song performed in an amazing manner. i also like the outfield, heart (whose electric version i never loved that much), tommy tutone is awesome, the motels sound great, and the rick springfield version is awesome.i highly recommend this cd to any 80's fan."
5,How do they do it?,How do they take songs that I thought I did not want to hear again and make them new and exciting? Even though I have heard these songs a million times I'm enjoying them all over. I highly recommend this whole CD as a new lease on some great songs. The whole thing is great - every song.
4,80s with some emotion!,"Most of these tunes acquire a nice, attention-getting emotional edge in their acoustic settings. ""She Blinded Me With Science"" is hilarious no matter what you do to it. Enjoy!"
3,Good gift for Fans of the Decade,Purchased this CD for the revision of Thomas Dolby's Science as a gift for a sick female scientist. Played it at work. At first it seemed like the worst hits of the 80s but improved as it progressed. The 30 somethings thought it was great start to finish. They were singing along.
3,not a rip off?,"no its not, there are some good tunes here, good stuff for the over forty music person who misses their Martha Steward M-TV days, beyond that I can't see who else would want it!"
4,"Good collection, but not necessarily all are ""new"" recordings","I bought this new collection hoping it would be all new recordings. In fact, some of these versions date as far back as the original recordings. Not that they sound bad, but there is a chance that you might already have some of these in your collection somewhere. I'll do you a favor and list all the new recordings, as the CD does not provide this until you read the liner notes. ""Jessie's Girl,"" ""The Metro,"" ""Only The Lonely,"" ""867-5309/Jenny,"" ""She Blinded Me With Science,"" ""Promises, Promises,"" and ""Our Lips Are Sealed"" are the new recordings. The rest are B-side and live acoustic versions. I'll leave it up the the listener to decide if these songs lose their aesthetic feel without the synths that made all these 80s songs so unique."
5,Scrub Rocks!,"This is one of the best indie albums I have ever heard--beautiful female vocals and pounding beats that really keep you moving. Each song is original--no ""isn't this the same bassline as the last track?"" I reccommend it to anyone."
5,Kick Ass!!!,"I have a very old signed copy of this from back in the day. And it skips so bad cuz I played it over and over and over again! lol. They played in a bar I worked in and I allways asked off so I could be there to enjoy it in the crowd when they came to Chattanooga, Tn. Love these peeps! LOVE them! They are the coolest group very outgoing and Petras vocals kicked booty! Serious booty! I loved Mikes drums and the over all experience listening to these guys are awesome! Very great stage performance live and on the disk. Does anyone know if they still play? And if so, where? I would fly to see them again!"
5,Scrub rocks,"This is one of the best albums I have heard. Somewhat dark lyrics, but very moving and energetic. This band is awesome live, if you get a chance, check them out."
5,Serenity in a jewelcase,"I use this tape whenever I have problems with migraines, sleeplessness or anxiety. The tones of the harp are soothing and smooth. The addition of ocean waves and seals barking at the end or beginning of the songs makes it easy to mentally place yourself on a deserted beach at Big Sur or anywhere on the Northern California coast. This CD is a true getaway from the stresses of life."
5,Most beautiful Music in my collection,"I am always looking for just the right piece of music to encourage relaxation and aid meditation, and have bought numerous CDs promising to do just that---but they don't. This CD is the most beautfiful of any I have ever heard. It takes you away with the first notes and you don't ever want to stop listening. The cover insert says ""we captured a magical interaction of musical souls creating on a bed of ocean wave sounds."" The seal who came to listen is a bonus. The only problem with this CD is that it's too short!!!"
5,"Great in ""Sliders""---Great in his CD!","From the first time I saw ""Sliders"" I was HOOKED--and looked forward to each and every episode with anticipation and joy. My two favorite characters were Arturo and Rembrandt ""Crying Man"" Brown of the Spinning Tops--he could sing and PLUS he looked handsome and proved to be very classy as the show progressed. If you are a fan of great MUSIC then this CD is for you. Though I'm probably buying it more for Rembrandt's memory than I am for Mr. Derricks, I still think that the ""Crying Man""/Cleavant Derricks can sing VERY WELL and has a GREAT voice! ""Kind of"" reminds one of Brian McKnight, except I've grown to appreciate Cleavant Derrick's style more than Mr. McKnights. Go Remmy!"
5,A Masterpiece,"""Beginnings"" by Cleavant Derricks is a work of art, and there is not one song on this album that I don't like. Cleavant is a class act, a great guy, and a truly talented musician. I look forward to more from him!"
5,Remmys slide,"Cleavant Derricks is the best singer ever and is the greatest on sliders playing Remmy""cryin man""Brown.i love the song ""remmys slide"" it is the best of the best so his he.and i like cruisin L.A. i wish there were more actor/singers in the world"
2,"Great voice, disappointing style","I'm a big fan of Mr. Derricks. After hearing him in ""Dreamgirls,"" I recognized his voice when I recently saw ""The Full Monty."" I was delighted to learn he had released a CD. With the many positive reviews, I eagerly anticipated listening.Unfortunately, this CD is very one-dimensional. There is very little up-tempo/energetic singing from Mr. Derricks, the kind of singing that characterizes his Broadway voice. His singing is earnest, and his voice is truly gifted, but it is the style of music on the CD, not the quality I was disappointed with. Most of this album seems to be techno-pop arrangements of ballads/mid-tempo music with little distinction. Not a CD I will listen frequently to."
1,nursery school lyrics,"I can't explain this CD, but the lyrics to me are very nursery school. Derricks does have a nice voice it's just not for this type of music."
5,perfect for kids young and old!!!,"Our kids listen to this all day long. My son's first word was ""Bop-bop"". We can't wait for more from this talented musician. We love the variety! I recommend this to everyone with a kid in their life."
1,Read better books,"Wrong. Sounding strangely like a Y2K book, Bright predicts a coming world wide revival by 2000 (like many of the late 80s and 90s), they sell books, but lose credibility as anyone can look back and see that this book was a false prediction. Maybe if we brought back the Mosaic law which required the stoning of false prophets (Deut 18:20) people would make less of them. It must of also been long periods of going without food that led Bright to come up with the ""carnal Christian"" heresy. Bill Bright was one of many who led multitudes of college students (Campus Crusade for Christ)to accept Jesus as Savior and made Lordship optional."
5,BIG BIG BIG BIG fan of the movies :),I love Disney world and I love love The Pirates Of The Carribbean! Great if you like both!
1,Some book contents is deliberate Fraud,Hi - I have purchased several copies of this book (Pirates of the Caribbean: From the Magic Kingdom to the Movies) for evidence because within it are several pages that contain deliberate concocted facts and lies about the history of Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean ride attraction. Written by Jason Surrell and signed off by Marty Sklar this book was used with their defense during legal proceedings of a lawsuit over the Pirates of the Caribbean movie (Royce Mathew vs Disney). I welcome all communications - I have a website with details pinpointing the concocted facts and lies found within this official Pirates of the Caribbean book. Google for more info etc..
5,This Pirate says arrrrrrrrrrlright !,"Lots o' great info on both the Ride @ the Disney Theme Parks + the Movie [wonder if they'll release future volumes including new chapters for the two PIRATE movie sequels?] ....If you don't want to read the book, please buy it for the artwork[best priced Disney Merchandise vs. what you will pay @ the Theme Parks] ....~(^)~"
3,children's stuff,As advertised. But the episodes follow a long list of advertisements for Disney products not exactly something a 2 year old is interested in...I am always a little disappointed with Disney's profiteering...wish I could find the old Mickey Mouse Clubhouse of the 60's!
5,Fantastic!,"I have a year and a half old baby girl and she is huge Barney's fan. We thought it would be a good idea to see if she'll like Mickey and got her this dvd. Bingo! She loves it. She can sit quietly and watch the whole DVD (4 episodes) at once. And she dances with them too. Of course she is scared of Pete, but I am always there so she can hold my hand when needed. If I manage to film her doing her Mickey dance (stumping her feet shouting Mickey, MIckey...) I will post it too for everyone to laugh.Although we bought this dvd at Target, we also had some problems with the running of the dvd. The picture would freeze and that was ugly. But, our DVD player was getting really old and sometimes wouldn't play other dvds as well, so we got a relatively cheap solution at Best Buy - sony dvd for fifty bucks. Now, everything works great. So, it could be that DVD disc is a little bit proficient for older dvd players. I am not a technician, just my thoughts.Cheers for the Clubhouse!"
1,Where is my DVD?,"I would love to rate this DVD, but I opened the case and guess what? The case was empty. Thanks so much. Nice Christmas gift....."
4,"Good collection, all repeats","You will not get any new episodes on this DVD. All of the episodes are previously aired Disney channel episodes of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. That said...This is a good collection of episodes with a common theme that they are all based on or similar to classic Fairy tales. My daughter loves the ""Donald the Frog"" episode and I love, ""Sleeping Minnie.""I read that some people had a problem with their dvd. I don't know if that is common, but I didn't have an issue with mine. We've watched it maybe three times (they are repeats we've seen, after all) and haven't had any problems."
5,Great DVD,"Great DVD, the stories are great, my son is almost 2 and he watched it three times last weekend and loved the bear and the frog stories. I was worried about the DVD quality after reading some of the reviews but the DVD worked great."
5,We watch this over and over and over and....,"My son adored this movie, I adored the price. Very reasonable price and great quality. I will continue to purchase from here in the future."
5,MM CLUBHOUSE,"This DVD is fun, entertaining, lively, colorful. My boys loved it and will watch it again and again and again!"
1,Could not use,Had to return this DVD it would not play in our system due to format was from overseas and I was unaware. Did get refund from this thanks!
4,My son LOVES Mickey Mouse!,"I bought this for my son, and he is absolutely mesmerized by Mickey Mouse. The episodes on this DVD are awesome and keep him entertained!"
5,Hours of fun for the kids,"Mickey Rocks! This is a great DVD, my son sings and plays along when Mickey ask for participation from the viewers at home. It's a compilation of different episodes from TV on one disk. I would recommend it."
2,"Dull, dull, dull","I was given this book as a gift, and was intrigued because I live in the Hudson Valley. All I can say is that I could not drag myself through this book. It is *not* lively; it is much too scholarly for what this book is trying to be."
2,Seen better,Not too informative. Cute little book for someone who has never had sex. Anyone who has had sex more than once knows as much as this book.
3,Very basic but good for married couples,It is decent and does give you some fun ideas to try with your spouse. As long as it is not to expensive it is worth it.
1,Disappointed,not what i was expecting at all - i should have returned it - not the seller's fault of course - just not what i thought it was !
3,Not What I was looking for but....,"Its great to see history about witchcraft and deamons and so on. Some of the pictures are somewhat disturbing and yet understandable where and how the ignorance of the 16th century began. Please remember, that this book barely has words; its just pictures and nothing else, so, buy it if your a history buff in witchcraft and the occult."
3,A picture book,nothing else....just a picture book...not too much text. You can't really learn a lot of background knowledge.
5,A Goddess' Perspective,"I danced to these songs with the band as a Goddess a Go-Go hundreds of shows. We had so many great times... Rockabilly Queen busted my butt though!Billy's music on this compilation was (and is) joyful, pleasant and uncomplicated. I loved it then and miss it now.I was shocked and moved to know it is still marketed... pulled it up via a Google search. This says to me enough other people are moved by Billy's music that it is still being produced. This is profound in that it means Billy continues to live and that is all he hoped for as his health deteriorated.Anyway, I only got one copy of the album (yes, that's all any of us got in the band without paying for them) and I left it in the backseat of my VW... it warped right after the release party at Lung Fung.Twenty years later, I finally can get a copy on CD and listen to it again...after all these years.Thanks, Amazon. This is very cool!"
3,I have mixed reviews about this album,"I grew up around the Portland, Oregon area and knew Billy. That is why I have mixed reactions to this album. I own it on vinyl and bought as a joke due to the fact that i was mostly into punk and retro garage/psych stuff. So I had to pull out my album and listen to it again. Not too bad pop rock. It does bring back memories when girlfriends would drag me to some of his shows. BTW if people don't know Billy died in 1987 or so. Eventhough i didn't like the guy personaly, it was sad to hear about it. Died of some kind of cancer I think. It really surprises me that his stuff is still in print.For the music review, He adopted a style called Boom Chuck Rockfrom a local one man musician. He could write some catchy songs,check him out out. EVL"
2,Amazon's system is broken,"Amazon has a system in place for buying things like these mud flaps to make sure that they will fit your car. I went through that process, chose the correct modeal, make and year and ordered mud flaps that supposedly fit my car. They didn't. I was having some body work done to my car and had asked about putting mud flaps on. The guy at the body shop said he'd be happy to put them on for me for no charge. When I got the car back he told me that he tried to put them on but there's no place to attach these on my car, a Buick Riviera. He showed me and there was no surface that these could be attached to in my wheel well. The product is probably good but I have no way of confirming that. Be carefull when ordering online, they may not fit even though it says they will."
4,Dear Abba a Hit,"These letters to the editor of the Jewish Forward give insight into the trials and tribulations of the early 20th century. Most correspondence is from recent immigrants to the United States who are trying to adjust to working conditions, personal relationships, family matters and legal problems. In spite of all the myriad issues, one is left with the impression that the letter writers are happy to have arrived in the ""Golden Land""."
4,Harriet is back!,Harriet is back spying! Ole Golly has come back to babysit while Harriet's parents are in France. But something is wrong with Old Golly and it's Harriet job to find out what. I loved this series of mysteries.
5,An older Harriet is in eleventh grade,"Helen Ericson's Harriet Spies Again provides a companion volume to Harriet The Spy, albeit by a different author. An older Harriet is in eleventh grade - and still pursuing mysteries. While her character has changed - she isn't the isolated youngster of the original title - her interest in sleuthing has only expanded. Readers will find this a satisfying continuation of Harriet's misadventures."
3,***,"I really don't know what to say about this book. I mean, it having one of my favorite characters of all time in it gives it one star on it's own. But, as the past 2 people mentioned Harriet's whole ""spy personality"" isn't completely there. I don't know, she's just different.Helen Ericson is a talented writer, but this book doesn't have the Harriet-esque features that ""Harriet The Spy"" and ""The Long Secret"" had. I hope to read more by Helen Ericson, but also hope that her newer writing is better than this."
5,Harriet the Spy,I think that this book is just so inspiring: it actually feels like you ARE Harriet. It's just amazingCooper Ackerly
2,Will the real Harriet please expose this imposter?,"In a concept fraught with peril, this sequel to Harriet the Spy (authorized by the estate of the late Louise Fitzhugh, but why??), has some redeeming details, such as the increased role of the prickly Cook. Unfortunately, the plot has turned Harriet into an obtuse narcissist. Instead of writing and observing, now she makes wild ridiculous speculations and spends her time, not on her notebook, but on a timeline of her life. Janie has disappeared in order to introduce a mysterious new girl across the street, though this intriguing character isn&#65533;t developed. Newer readers are likely to be more entertained than die-hard Harriet fans, who are apt to be appalled at this caricature of our beloved heroine."
1,I Won't Let My Kids Read this Book,"This book might be OK if you weren't capitvated by the original Harriet. If you're a true Harriet fan, however, you'll find yourself wondering about this imposter.It's not that it's a terrible book. The characters are funny and interesting, there is a nice plot, there is some resolution to the characters' stories from the earlier book.But it also isn't quite right. Harriet seems a bit whinier, meeker. She was always so funny and astute. She doesn't seem to have it here. Instead of finding her and her foibles delightful, I found them verging on annoying. The little touches, like her crashing weddings, seemed unnatural and forced.I plan to encourage my children to read Harriet the Spy. But this book, I'm afraid, might ruin the magic for them. I was curious as to what another writer might dream up for this childhood heroine of mine. I think I would have been better off wondering and coming up with my own ideas."
2,I like the original,"I think this is a total fake to the original Harriet the Spy- not even by the same author. I have even heard on a website to 'avoid it like the plague.' I think that nothing could possibelly replace Louise Fitzhugh's wonderful book Harriet the Spy, especially not a fake sequal called 'Harriet Spies Again.' I am sorry to say this, but to be truthful I must."
2,"Simple love story, but...","I have read other books by this author and while they do have some minor faults (editing, typos etc) I have enjoyed them. I can understand an author wanting to set a book in another country but wish a little research was done first! As an Australian I was very annoyed at the misspelling of Sydney with an ""i"" vice ""y"" throughout the book. Also we do NOT have rattle snakes in Australia; many other equally dangerous snakes etc but not rattlers. Otherwise the book was enjoyable but very very predicatable. An easy way to spend a few hours."
5,Improve your French,"Almost unknown in the US, Mylene Farmer is the largest selling francophone singer of all time. The lyrics are literate. The arrangements are clever, and the production values are impecable. But this is what you would expect from someone who can sell out a stadium (in France) mere minutes after the tickets become available on-line."
5,Nonstick Angle Cake Pan,Great quality materials and sturdy enough for daily use. Releases cake easily with no additional cooking spray. Heats evenly and quickly!
3,Not really satisfied,"Well, I got this game thinking that it would be a great killing spree kind of game. With violence and the whole bit. It's sad to find that this game didn't show the violence action that I was looking for. The blurred out scenes made it hard to follow the cruel executions because you're trying to read the controller's instructions AND trying to focus in on what's going on. It's almost impossible if you're not used to the controls yet.The storyline is about the only thing that is keeping my interest. I can see where the storyline is going but playing this game feels like watching an action/horror with the action part missing. It's pretty sad.The graphics of this game is alright, you can see they really tried to integrate a somewhat realistic game with the wii's compatibilities.All n all, it's a solid game but it's missing a few things fans would love."
2,not thrilled,This game was rather hard to navigate through which made us lose interest quickly and now it is collecting dust....
3,"Great until the ""shooting"" parts","Like some other reviewers have pointed out, this game is excellent at the beginning but when you get to level 8 named ""Assassination"" it becomes a shooter and I didn't feel like continuing to play at this point. I think they should have stick with the ""stealth"" gameplay with less shooting throughout the game."
2,Buggy,"I'm not really able to enjoy the game as my character continually freezes or seems to get stuck. I then have to flail the controls to get him unstuck. This happened several times in the 1 hour I played the game.I can't say I enjoy the controls, having to move the Wii remote and/or nun-chuck in any number of directions to kill people. It would be nice to have simple button controls for a game like this for more accurate movement."
2,"Good, but lacking any replay value","This game features some intense violence and gore, but does not focus entirely on that. It is a stealthy action game that involves hiding from a group of enemies and slowly trying to find your way around them (usually means killing them). The story and acting is the best Ive seen in a game, so if you really enjoy a good story, Manhunt 2 in definitely worth it.But if you like the original Manhunt, you may be a little dissappointed in Manhunt 2 mainly because there is no bonus levels and no rankings on the levels, meaning when you beat a level, theres really no point in playing it again because you cant even try to beat your last time or anything. I did like the new weapons and new execution types, but since the game got filtered, there is no point in trying to do the most gruesome execution, which was another replay value for me in the first one.Overall, a good game and story, but since theres no replay value, its really only worth renting."
2,Defenitely dissapointed,If you played the first game the first thing you'll notice about this one is the executions. Compared to the first there PG rated. You cant even see whats going on in them. I had to turn the brighntess up all the way and squint like i was blind to get a remote idea of what was happening. A huge dissapointment from the first.Overall gameplay is very similar the integration of the WII remote is actually very good. When you shoot you have to point the Wii controller as you would a good and it works very well. the graphics are also very similar. But if your looking forward to a game as crazy and gory as the first your going to be dissapointed
4,Bad Rockstar,"The game is fun. But it definitly doesn't live up to all the hype. It's not scary and not violent enough. Guess Rockstar caved in to much, bad Rockstar bad."
3,Noritake Gracia snack set,NORITAKE GRACIA 5792 SNACK TRAY & CUP SETSDelivery and packaging were excellent however the price of the item is too expensive.
5,A Great BOOK,If you are looking for a book that will keep you spellbound and on or toes this is it. When reading this incredable book I could Barely put it down. Defiantly read this series.
5,Drumroll please,Rowley comes through with another dragon story that looks into the far past and brings it forward. Readers finally see one of the other-plane dangers mentioned before. If the dragon master fails to publish again it will be a crime against humanity
5,House Music All Night Long (Say What?),"The third installment in the Best Of House Music series features yet more twists and turns. This time Detroit is invited in. One of the most recognizable tracks at the time was included on this compilation-and rightfully so: ""Strings of Life"". And, of course you can't have Rhythm is Rhythm on the album without the other breakout sensation, Inner City: ""Good Life was getting much airplay on Chicago radio, especially on the college stations. The included version of ""Rock To The Beat"" by Reese has that original Detroit Techno feel to it--before everything got 'distorted'. New York, New Jersey and Chicago influences are still evident, and there is even some representation another adopted home of House, London. ""Voodoo Ray"" is another track that stands the test of time because it's just that dancable!This is a trip down memory lane that is just as enjoyable as the other two. You can't go wrong with this album...House Music All Night Long!"
5,House Music All Night,If you're between 29-37 you remember these classic house tunes. The Eighty's are a memory of college days which have swiftly passed. 5 Stars for the house...HOUSE MUSIC FOREVER!
3,Don't be fooled.,"This CD is not the collection of early tracks that it claims to be. Rather, it is a transparent cash-in consisting of tracks already available. The first and last ""dancey"" songs were actually made in the 90's using samples from TG tracks. Don't believe it? Check out the ""Fractured Garden"" album by Genesis's project Splinter Test. Many of the other songs on this CD are lifted directly from TG's live series. That said, it's not a bad CD. There is some great material there, but be aware that the liner notes are not to be trusted."
4,Throbbing Epistles!,"This is probably the most listenable of the TG albums that I have yet to hear. ""What a Day"" is clearly one of the highlights of this album, mainly because it features an excellent sample of an inmate at some penitentiary talking to adolescents about the rigors of prison life (a la Scared Straight). ""Leeds Ripper"" is also a perennial favorite as is the first track on the album and ""Her Arm Was Her Leg"". Whatever anybody has to say about TG in terms of musical ability/talent will always sound a bit presumptuous to me (especially if the criticism happens to be negative or derogatory). TG seems to have been first and foremost conceptual art/cultural terrorism interested in exploring/exploiting conventions and cultural mores in an attempt to discover what lies beyond the frontiers of acceptability. Music just happened to figure into the equation as a means of achieving specific ends. Well, if you're interested in the TG sound I would recommend this album and also Dimensia in Excelsis."
5,Waiting for the next installment of Lucky's adventures ...,"Order Silicon Secrets for your book group (we did), gather your girlfriends around, and have a rip-roaring time discussing Lucky and whether or not you'd put up with his shenanigans."
4,Interesting characters,I enjoyed this book. The characters were interesting and the dialogue made the book flow with quick pacing. The rapid evolvement of the plot makes Silicon Secrets a recommended book for those looking for a pool-side read.
4,Excellent Read,The characters came to life and the story flowed with multiple POV's and intertwine plot lines. The way the different story lines came together at the end of the book was impressive. Loved the surprise ending.
4,Will be kept in my read-again shelf,"I loved the Characters in Silicon Secrets, and the way the story climaxed into a surprise ending. There was Lucky who I couldn't decide whether to hate or love; Heather, the sweet one with the secret life; and J.J. who was one of those people you marvel at like a somewhat wicked fantasy. The story had a touching concept. I can see Catherine Burr's exceptional talent for writing in this, her first novel, and I am looking forward to reading more of her writing."
4,"Tuck ""Silicon Secrets"" into your beach bag!","I was immediately drawn in the troubled life of young Lucky Lukovich, whose passion for life, matched his passion for women. Like a wild animal, would Lucky be tamed by free-spirited Heather or become like his mentor, J.J., whose interest in Lucky, was not all business. The sexual tension between J.J. and Lucky was hot-hot-hot."
4,An unenlightened opinion,"I'd heard only unmemorable snippits of this band before I heard ""Schnitzel Boy"" on the radio. It was enticingly clever, catchy, and comparatively hardcore, but I didn't know who the artist was. I searched and found it was by Consolidated, which surprised me because I thought they were strictly industrial, or at least more electronic. The whole album, while not quite as tight, is mostly very good harder rock with a mind behind it (again knowing nothing else by them) and an occasional dash of technology. It gets preachy, perhaps even heavy-handed, but that doesn't really detract from the sound. More power to them if they can make a musically-sound political album. All in all, this doesn't convince me to buy another album new, but it's a welcome addition to the collection (and should be in yours as well)."
2,Not that great - Stick with the first two,"I like Consolidated quite a bit - they're one of my favorite bands, in fact. However, this record is real garbage. With feverous anticipation I purchased it about six months ago, threw it on the cd player, listened for twenty minutes, and was disgusted. Stick with Business of Punishment (really really good) or Play more Music (almost equally as good with a great song done with the Yeasty Girls !)"
3,Fibromyalgia by Don Goldenberg,"The book is clearly written and very helpful to the lay person. It combines academic and experiential teachings in a superb way. The fact and fiction section at the end of each chapter is very helpful. This is amust read for anyone who has, or is close to someone who has fibrmyalgia, CFS or any other chronic pain syndrome. It is also a must if you have chronic pain, feel fatigued and have not found a doctor who has helped you."
2,Foreword by Prof. Simon Wessely- 'nuff said,"Prof. Goldenberg is a smart doctor, but unfortunately, like many others, he has had the wool pulled over his eyes by Prof. Wessely, Barsky and other insurance lobbyists trained as psychiatrists and posing as scientists. Prof. Goldenberg explicitly states that there is a biological basis for ME (""CFS""), Fibromyalgia and IBS (p.74), but almost in the same breath (p. 73) he states they have no documented biological basis. The first statement is the true one, btw. He also attributes far too much weight to emotional perpetuation (and it seems causation) in these diseases. He is part way there to understanding these diseases, which is far further along than the vast majority of physicians. I would ask him to go the final mile in trying to understand these physical diseases. I would be more than happy to discuss this with the author. Thanks for taking the time to read and good luck healing everyone!Justin"
3,"good information, but too much filler","Dr. Goldenberg is a legitimate authority on fibromyalgia, and this book does a good job of separating fact from fiction, but the vast majority of the content is annoying stories about his patients and research. I think the intent was to provide examples and provide a cathartic outlet for the reader, but really it is just a waste of time.However, each chapter has a 1-page summary at the end that tells you almost everything you need to know. You can read these summaries only and get 80% of the valuable content. Nonetheless, I recommend the book because it is one of the few trustworthy sources in a sea of misinformation, scams and outright lies.Fibro is a very poorly understood disease and many seek to take advantage of it's victims with miracle cures, magic diets, 'alternative' treatments, and so-called 'research.' With Goldenberg, you can trust what he says."
4,Fun racing game for Master System,This is a fun racing game for the Sega Master System. It's probably one of the best racing games made available for an eight bit system. I highly recommend this game for anyone who owns a Sega Master System.
5,A great story to share with children,"This is a wonderful story to share with children. I read it to my class of 7,8 and 9 year olds and they would clap and cheer when they relised it was story time. There is something for everyone; boys and girls will love it. There are twists and turns, so be ready for the unexpected!"
5,A near-model anthology,"I use this book, together with Paul Muldoon's Contemporary Irish Poetry and Fallon/Mahon's Contemporary Irish Poetry as texts for Adult Education.Crotty's book has 47 poets and gives a short insightful introduction to every poet. It is a wide-ranging book, including 3 modernist poets, 5 poets who write in Irish--for which there are sensitive translations by Crotty himself as well as Muldoon and Heaney. Most space is given to Muldoon, Heaney, Kavanagh, MacNeice, Kinsella, Durcan, Clarke, O Riordáin, and Ní Dhomhnaill in that order. The poems are generally well chosen. Ciaran Carson is represented, and the other fine young poet in Irish Cathal O Searcaigh. There is the good humor of Durcan, Duhig and McDonald. My students feel warmly about the book, and are writing surprisingly good poems of their own as response to it."
3,wrong case,I just received my order of 2 cases for my night guard. They are neither white nor do they look anything like the ones on the pictures. They are taller...what I actually don't like...because I travel a lot and I wanted a slim one like on the picture...but I have to say the quality seems to be much better than the one I had from my dentist!The colours are nice too...green and blue...good for a kid I guess ;)I won't send it back because I don't want to wait for new ones to come in and I doubt I would get the ones shown on the picture!!! That's the reason for 3 stars only!
1,Item not as pictured,"I always feel awful writing a bad review but I did not get the retainer case I ordered. The retainer case that arrived had no holes on the bottom, which was the reason I picked this one over any others sold on Amazon. Also it was just flat in the front, no easy open plastic you see in the picture. What I ended up with some cheapo retainer case that looks like its going to break along the connection points after opening it a few times. Given the price point, it's not worth my time to return it but I could never recommend this to anyone."
3,ok product,"They made this thing with as absolutely cheap quality as they could. It basically fulfills its simple function, but I don't expect it to last. The hinge will give out before long I expect. I'm getting so weary of cheap China-made junk such as this."
1,This sucks stay away,"I was told to just plug both ends of this thing in. One to my router the other to the computer. It doesn't work and the setup guide is rediculous. This is the biggest waste of money, buy a reputable brand who wouldn't put a piece of crap like this out on the market."
2,same bright pixilation,"I came across Satan's Slave from Netflix. About 15 minutes in the entire screen would pixilate brightly for a second. This happened every minute. After five minutes of this I gave up. Poor quality is one thing, outright rolling flash pixilations----intolerable and inexcusable. It sounds like from the other comment that this defect might affect production runs of this product. The movie had potential, but a technical defect in transfer and production can destroy the watchability of any film."
1,broken,"Bought this knowing the quality would be garbage, but didn't expect it to actually be glitch ridden. Fifteen or so minutes into satan's slave, the screen would flash every so often in a bright pixelated mess. This happened frequently thereafter. It happened on a different player as well and the disc was scratch free. I'd say the tranfer was never even watched by the distributors. Unless it is a faulty disc in the lot, seems this version should be avoided at all costs."
1,Beware,"Do not purchase this machine. Besides the toner being so high you will be in for a surprise at the other consumable items that this machine requires. I purchased my 9420 in October 2005 and it has a page count of 14216. Today it come up with an error code to replace the OPC Belt. After looking in the owners manual I find that OPC Belt has to be replaced every 60,000 IMAGES. Please not that I said images, not page count. After contacting Brother I discovered that this OPC Belt carries a price tag of $503.99. If you add the price of the OPC Belt ($503.99, replace 60000 IMAGES), Fusing Unit ($577.99, replaced approx every 60,000 pages), and the high cost of the toner this unit is a real lemon."
1,BEWARE,after 60 000 pages you will have spend well over 4000$ in consumables apart from the required tonersafter 4000 pages complete replacement of low stater toners600$every 15000 pages500$ belt kitevery 60000 but really about 40000 pagesa wopping 799$ fuser kit replacementWhat a joke on brothers part. Contacted them and they admit their fault but far from ready to correct their disaster. I even heard they send free belt kits to calm the furious responses of customers. Simply not buying anything with their name on it!
1,MFC 9940 sucks both in terms of networking and amount of time it takes to set this up,"I have had the MFC for a few hours and moved twice. Each time its been painful to reset this up. I tried to set this up as a network printer and OMG. This thing sucks you dry in terms of time and amount of nonsense. Try using the Brother Website to find a drive. It says this product does not exist. Brother's customer service. Non existent and no help.I have an old HP 2600 that was bought before the MFC 9940. It took me all of ten minutes to set it up to print in home network.I am never ever buying a Brother. I have used so many of Brother devices and each time I have the same set of issues. Forget the price folks, just pay a bit extra and buy some other brand."
1,70 lbs. of garbage - don't even think about it,"I selected this color laser as a follow on to my previous Brother B/W laser because it was such a reliable workhorse and it lasted for years. Boy was I disappointed. My first mistake was assuming the label ""Brother"" on the front actually meant anything. This printer is not even a Brother design, which explains a lot. I've had this Printer for over a year now, and basically, it's the worlds most efficient paper jammer. Even though it has all my checklist of features, and I can refill the toner without buying the expensive cartridges, it's all kind of pointless if you can't get the paper through. This will be the last time I buy any product by name brand only. I suspect that the problem is something simple with the paper sensor, but in my opinion, if it was designed properly in the first place, there wouldn't be any problem. Oh Brother, where art thou quality?"
1,Brothers sells Junk,"This thing has been nothing but trouble. We have had problems with the drums, the ink cartridges, paper jams, etc. Brothers has NOT been helpful in workig with us to resolve the problems. The thing will only use Brothers cartidges...and they cost a fortune...and they don't last near as long (print as many pages) as they are advertised. Don't waste your money on 'Brothers' products."
1,Brother MFC-9420CN is the Yugo of Laser printers,"I bought the Brother MFC-9420CN about 6 months ago. It worked fine for the first 3 months. But now the thing is a useless paper weight. It is noisy, and very SLOW. It takes 60 seconds or more for it to warm up before it will print. And I still have never seen it print as fast as they claim. I have contacted the technical support so many times I think they have me on their Christmas card list. I requested their ""in home repair service"" 2 weeks ago, and still do not have an appointment scheduled. At this point I am about ready to donate it and get a Cannon or HP. I mean even a box of crayons would be better than this thing."
2,Comes with starter toner cartridges.,"Something you should also consider when buying this is that it comes with the starter toner cartridges which have half the toner of the ones you normally buy. These toner cartridges go for around $130.00+ a piece (they have 4 seperate cartridges in each printer, black, cyan, magenta, blue, for a total of around 400.00+ more if you need all 4) so in a short period of time you will be spending hundreds of dollars more on this printer.Brother should have the full toner cartridges in this unit when you purchase it."
2,"Excellent Printer, if it doesn't start falling apart","I have only had this printer for 2 days. I don't think I have printed/copied more than 20 pages yet! The first day I used the copier and it copied color pages really good. It printed fine with both the MAC and PC. Today, I copied another color page and the paper jammed. I unjammed the paper and tried to make another copy. It jammed again. I was able to get the paper out this time, but I had to grab it from the bottom. Now the back door will not close. Somehow a little part came loose and I don't know where it belongs. The part did not fall out, I saw it loosely wedged behind something on the door.I cannot believe they made something so flimsy. I did not do anything with the back door. So, the printer is going back."
1,Terrible,"This product is very slow. It claims 30+ pages per minute, but first it needs to warm up for up to 2 minutes...all while making loud noises as if its struggling. Color copies are not color-accurate...even after tweaking the settings. Jams up-often...atleast once a day. The only thing this is good for is a fancy paper-weight to make the office look impressive. Thats about it."
1,"Mac users, DO NOT BUY.","No driver for OSX 10.4 tiger!Current driver prints 4 copies when you ask for 2,, Will not print a web page from the browser. Have not seen any acknoledgement on there site about this, NOR a timetable when the driver will be fixed,. The color is terrible after callibration,,,, calibration, panel selection does not work and will not reset to factory defaults..ENVELOPES, have tried 3 different kind of envelopes and JAMMED ON ALL.You must unload the paper tray to print batch envelopes and resize it, even if its just for one envelope. Manual didnt clearly specify which way to load envelopes .and in the end not helpfull in several areas, nor was the lack of a functional driver. The printers control center software is a awkward affair compaired to other brands i have used. I cant reccomend this printer for any thing more than a paper weight for a Windows or Mac user , personal or business....."
1,Horrible,"Just HORRIBLE!!!! Do not buy this machine. It is extremely slow, noisy, and expensive to operate. What a waste of money. I wish I would have read these review before my purchase. This doesn't even deserve one star."
2,Too many consummable parts,"Like other Brother products I have purchased, I was initially happy with the printer...until I discovered all of the items Brother has on it that are ""consummable."" Ugh! $500+ for the UPC belt, $500 for the fuser assembly. I found both items for about half the retail price from online discount sources. After I'd replaced both of these units, there is still a problem with the print quality - there is a large black line down the center. I'm told it needs a new drum and other parts with a price tag of almost $400. The bottom line is the workmanship is of poor quality. My next printer will be a solid ink printer (Xerox Phaser)."
1,I should have checked here before buying,All the reviews I have read are right on point. Our small non-profit org. had been in the market for a new all in one color printer but didn't want to open an expensive account with a maintenance agreement. So when I say this machine on sale at Office Depot for less than $400 I jumped on it. Wow! What a fool I was. This machine has cost us several times as much as we paid for it just in toner and now after only a few months we need to change the OPC belt. Brother should be ashame of themselves. I wish I had checked here before buying.
1,Useless Junk Returned to Seller -- NO Stars!,"It took close to 2 hours to unpack and set up. Then it jammed on the first copy and I couldn't unjam it. I spent another hour re-packing it (it took 2 of us to do that because it weighs 76 lbs) and it's going right back to the seller. DON'T BUY IT!! If it can't function using ordinary copier paper like my other 3 printers, it will likely cause endless problems."
5,mat hoffman has done it again!,"ANYONE WHO HAS EVER PICKED UP A BIKE NEEDS TO PLAY THIS GAME!!!!this game is what you'd expect from activision awsome and fun all rolled into one.this game is great, in my opinion everyone should play this game bmx rider or not this is ... a sick game take it from meits sweet!"
5,All's well that ends well.....,"As part of a remodel for our bathroom we included a bidet. It was easily installed and works very well. Great water pressure but, you do sometimes have to wait for the warm water. I feel it has greatly increased the hygene of my family, especially, my wife and daughter......"
3,lacking pressure,"I bought this model because I've had good luck with BB in the past, but I have moved on and left the old unit in the old place. Although easy to set up (even the hot water was a breeze), the BB Envie really doesn't have a lot of pressure when maxed out. If you are looking for help with constipation or anything other than just a wash, I wouldn't recommend this. But it got me by until I rigged up electricity and purchased a powered bidet (Clean-Sense 1500R)."
2,worked for 4 months..then broke and cant return.,"From a prepper standpoint you need TP or a wash to maintain a clean house and save money. This worked great for a tp saver and comfort. When you mount it your seat no longer sits level. So when my old seat bent there was a little pressure on the plastic mount. It was fine and then pow, broken. Broken at a gasket point. Cant return and am wondering if all the headache of install is worth an upgrade. I probably will, just dont know to what. Frustrated for spending 70 bucks for 4 months and have no recourse. I suppose if it works on your toilet money well spent. If not, you lose money and time. Like everything."
1,Didn't work!,I have had lansky's for years but this specific one was dull within ONE knife sharpening. I suspect the diamonds were not attached to the handle appropriately. I would still use their products but would like to warn folks about this problem.
3,Average for good standards,"Brief segue showing more left-field electronic dance influence starting to creep in with this fun, but not necessary release. It's not one of their must own EP's, but at least B&S never seemed to exploit the format like so many others."
5,more perfection,"the best band of my generation continue their brilliant work, five stars is never enough when it comes to the genius that is belle and sebastian."
5,Excellent!,"Like the new iPhoto 5 Missing Manual, this one is in full color as well.What I liked best about this book is that it spends a majority of the time discussing how to take better shots, how to give the editing a more polished look, and generally how to improve your finished product. Along with showing you how to use iMovie, the book goes over when and why (or why not!) to use the various transitions and special effects. Always with an eye toward ""professional techniques"".All told, a must have book on iMovie HD.One thing I was looking for but couldn't find was some discussion on iMovie HD vs Final Cut Express HD - what the differences are, why I would use one or the other, when to upgrade advice, etc.Oh, yeah - the information on iDVD is also great - plenty of tips and tricks on getting the most out of iDVD. Once you get great looking movies, iDVD makes putting together a great looking DVD a snap."
4,music to meditate you,"Whether you're lost in trance or deep into the dishes, this cd exerts a powerful pull into the subtle world of spiritual sentiments. Just as background music, it has a spiritualizing aura that slowly spills over into your most mundane moments. A must for us ""too busy to meditate"" types!"
2,Do not stay cold,These bandanas do not stay cold longer than a half hour or so. I work in a very hot environment and these did NOT keep me cool.
2,Ehhh.,"Ordered RED, received BLUE. Naturally disapointed.On a very hot day in Detroit area; didn't stay cool very long. Disapointed."
3,Good idea,I think the ice bandana is a good idea and the instructions and information given with it indicated that it would keep you cool or the ice wouldn't melt for 3 hours. Well I'm lucky if the ice bandana stays cool and not melted for 40 minutes. It's good for the first 15 minutes or so and then after that it is not much help.
3,nice & interesting,i like this book... it is one of the best i bought on points and figures...but there are not enough good examples...
1,Spills,"Lip too shallow, so you can't fill pitcher and pour without spilling, and even half full, you have to pour very carefully. I hate to throw out plastic, so I'm using it for a dipper for bird seed."
2,Polycarbonate is BAD for food storage,"Polycarbonate is made with Biphenyl-A, a chemical invented in the 1930s in search for synthetic estrogens. It is a hormone disruptor (creepy!). Leaches into foods as product ages, but cold conditions like a refridgerator might make plastics brittle and supseptable to fracturing where potent acid residues (lemons, citrus, tea tannins) can harbor and work the plastic to a leachng frenzy! Not to mention, brewing teas or pouring hot coffeee(to make iced coffee) will likely soften and expose the plastic to restructuring/decomposing.Enough with the fear tactics, it's just 'clearly', not a good idea for you or your loved ones. I don't know what plastics are alright, but if you can't get a glass container, try one made of acrylic."
4,Pretty in Pink,"Pink Lemonade, that is! I really like this pitcher and am very pleased with my purchase."
3,Spoken word for Rozz enthusiasts,"This is like any other spoken word, for those who either like spoken word or just truly want another piece of the artistic work of Rozz Williams. Another piece for true fans to hold on to his memory. Some of the sounds are crude but as always Rozz puts his true soul into it and let's you get a little closer to who he is inside."
2,Cheesy packaging,"Like the previous reviewer we, ordered these cameras and were very dissapointed in them. We returned them. I just wanted to emphasize how cheesy the actual item looks. I cannot overstate how goofy the photo of the wedding couple printed on the cameras is."
2,Wrong packaging,"I was disappointed when I received these cameras because the picture on the website showed that they had an orchid print (my wedding theme) on each camera. Instead, they arrived with a picture of a wedding couple on a yellow background -- no orchids. I wouldn't have ordered these cameras if I realized that they weren't packaged as shown."
3,He's done much better,I've been a fan for a long time and was looking forward to this one. It kept my attention throughout -- I stayed up till 3 am finishing it. But there's not so much there there. A lot never really went anywhere. Some beautiful writing and good story-telling. The parts never added up enough though.
2,"_Man Who Fell_ lite, and not in a good way","I do my best never to judge a work of art by comparing it to another. I started reading _Now Is the Hour_ specifically reminding myself not to compare it to _Man Who Fell in Love with the Moon_, (which I loved) but it was impossible. _Now Is the Hour_ is so much like _Man Who Fell_ that it's like trying to resist comparing a cheap knock-off to its real inspiration. Shed's voice in _MWFiLwtM_ was believable, riveting, and quirky in a true-sounding way. Rigby John's, to be understated, isn't. Mr. Spanbauer uses far too many of the same allegories, speech patterns and literary pyrotechnics, and warmed-over, they seem kinda cheesy.I was disappointed with the book, but I wonder how I'd feel if I hadn't read _MWFiLwtM_ first. I have a feeling I'd still consider it a superior work of fiction to _Now Is the Hour_."
2,"""Punctuation Please!""","This is my second Spanbauer piece and overall the story was a good one. However, again I find his writing difficult to read as the guy doesn't believe in using ""quotation marks"" to set off the dialogue from the rest of the narration. Anyway, the book came highly recommended to me and I have to say I was rather disappointed."
4,Tom Spanbauers worst books beat most author's best,"Okay, if you're already a Spanbauer fan, you should know that much of the material in here echoes that of Faraway Places, especially in the relationship with the father. For newbies, I can say a couple things. If you're a fan of rural fiction, like that of Kent Haruf (Plainsong) or James Galvin (the Meadow) this would be a great book for you. It's as much about small town America as anything. For those of you who found SPanbauer through his protoge, Chuck Palahniuk, I would advise you start with In the City of Shy Hunters as it's more like one of Palahniuk's."
4,Humorous and painful,"I read ""The man who fell in love with the moon"" first and enjoyed it alot. This was a painful and humorous insight into the 1960's-early 70's deep country coming out process. God !! religion can be such a blind and damaging tool. Some might find parts a bit tediously slow as I did because of his stream of consciousness dialogue."
4,Nice unit for much less than the competition.,"The Tiger2000 is a nice compromise for the budget conscious folks who want a quality wet sharpener. For the cost of this unit and all the jigs you could dream of it is very possible your costs would still be less than that other ""glamor"" sharpener.Most of the Jet and Tormek jigs will work on this machine and the only one that for sure doesn't is the planer/jointer knife jig. Rikon is the distributer for Scheppach in the US and is helpful should you have any questions.The unit does have a smaller grinding wheel than the Jet and Tormek but for most folks in a hobby shop the life of the stone will be fairly long regardless.The units motor is adequate for the task it is designed to do.The tool rests clamp firmly in place and hold your jigs securely to ensure a solid sharpening surface.I would recommend this unit to anyone who is considering buying a high priced wet grinder but having trouble swallowing the inflated price."
4,Seems to be a good machine,"If you don't get the nut tight enough the grind wheel will come loose when you put pressure on it, so it would have been better to have the shaft and nut threaded the other way but other than that I'm happy with the overall quality of the machine."
5,The Complete Man,"After reading Angeles Crest, I bought two more copies and I'm putting them away for my boys and will give them the books in a few years when they are young men. Michael Modzelewski is the type of man I want my sons to become. In this very personal book, we meet a man as strong as steel, yet so incredibly sensitive. With such passion, he loves nature and women intertwined. He's an athlete, very much in a beautiful body, yet at the same time he's a bookish scholar. He's a material realist with his head in some pretty courageous clouds. And he's the very rare man who actually communicates his feelings (brilliantly!) Amazing how one man encompasses so much of life -- and then some!!"
5,Keeping the pace within,"Mr.Modzelewski has written an impressive book that not only affects the spirit, but the physical being as well. We travel through each grueling mile at an exact pace with him as he relates electrifying stories which keep him going that extra mile and us turning the pages. I really felt as though I were running with him. This is an excellent choice for any person who has experienced an awakening that has affected their spirit, their soul, their very essence.In Mr. Modzelewski's case it led to an outstanding performance of a difficult marathon, a bonding with his family and a soaring of the spirit. I could not put it down and I can't wait for his next work!"
2,loved the part about the Angeles Crest 100,"The parts of this book about the Angeles Crest 100 were great. I could not get into the stream of consciousness elements that are 90% of the book. I tried, but ended up skipping them and reading the parts about his 1989 sub 24 hour performance at AC. Not sure I gave it a real chance, but after a couple of pages, it seemed self indulgent. But, his race report was very good"
5,A Dharma Bum Supreme,"In our age of crass materialism and 'Who Wants to be aMillionaire?' ... Michael Modzelewski leads us down a different path, where the wealth is far richer. In ANGELES CREST, he turns his back on commercialism in pursuit of spiritual rewards. As I read this book, I kept thinking of how Jack Kerouac would be proud, and a bit envious for this author has not only carried on the tradition of being a rucksack wanderer and dharma bum all across the american west and most of the world, but Modzelewski goes much further, actually finding the deeper enlightment that Kerouac was seeking.... The highs in this book are all-natural and hard-earned each step of the way. Modzelewski is not only a great writer but an enlightened bodhisattva. Bask in the glow!"
5,Five Really Big Stars,"I read this book mostly on the strength of Michael M's first book, ""Inside Passage."" I loved reading about his adventures on an Alaskan island, and his encounters with the wild and the whimsical in that remote wonderland. I must confess that I am not a runner, and wouldn't necessarily have bought ""Angeles Crest"" to read about running. BUT AM I EVER GLAD I DID buy it! This book is a chronicle of the most remarkable metaphysical and spiritual odyssey that I have ever encountered, and I am a metaphysical book junkie. If you have any doubts about the existence of ""parallel worlds"" that are accessible to any of us who are willing to make the trek into them, via running or any other spiritual practice, this book will blow your mind. Two big thumbs up, and five really big stars."
5,Brave New World,"I always sensed that the daily low-down life that we accept as being normal is far from the highest reality available to us. After reading ""Angeles Crest,"" especially the amazing, soul-shaking second half, I now know that a better world can exist if only we rise up, as the author has done, to meet it. Mr. Modzelewski, in a very personal quest has done this: shown the way into a brave new world that solves so many of the problems we are now being destroyed by. This is such an important book, but may not, at first read, be considered thus, for it is very entertaining as well. If you think an individual life can't matter much -- read what incredible depths Michael has explored for us, recalling that saying that ""One man with courage is a majority."" You will never look at life and the limited way we live in the same way after reading ""Angeles Crest""."
3,Solid release.,"Being a part of the audience during Manson's Guns, God, and Government tour led to purchases 2 albums from both the opening acts, one being The Union Underground and the other being Godhead. After giving 2000 years a listen I went and purchased this older release. Power Tool Stigmata has it's peaks and gutters of both good, bad and even unique efforts,but, other than being a solid studio band, Godhead is clearly in their prime when on stage in front of the people. Their live show alone makes them worth mentioning."
5,"Amazing CD, but they are even more amazing live.","This cd is a must have for any music lover. Listening to it is an emotional rollar coaster, so if you are in a bad mood you can put this cd on and feel exactly where Jason's lyrics are coming from, Or if you need some good music for a party this cd is a winner. Just buy it you will not be dissapointted in any way. And I highly recomend seeing them live their performance is very powerful"
3,3 and a half stars,"I bought 2000 Years of Human error, and i thought it was awesome. But this one should have been a little heavier with a little more catchier songs. I mean, the last 6 songs or so aren't that great, but they're not as bad as the beginning of the album. I just wish these guys could have had an album that human error was its sequel. Its not worth buying. Try getting it burned, or download some songs off Napster."
5,Godhead's CD Power Tool Stigma is a extremly intruging CD,"I don't know where to start so I'll just say why I like this CD so much. First of every song has a theme moral story and much meaning to it which I like most about any CD meaning. Second well it sounds great it isn't metal, punk, or techno but a aswome mixx of them all giving it a distincive feel and sound :)"
5,"safe, effective pain relief","After being diagnosed with degenerative disc disease, I thought I was doomed to a life of regular ibuprofen use. When my liver began to show side effects from the regular use of ibuprofen, I thought I was doomed to a life of pain. Then I began to research herbal anti inflammatories and decided to give Crystal Star Anti Flam a try. I did not notice an instant effect, but after a month of taking it twice per day I was almost pain free. Not only did Anti-Flam reduce my disc and nerve pain, it also helps with my nasal allergies and sinusitis. The herbal mixture seems to work on every kind of inflammation, unlike ibuprofen and acetaminophen.My husband suffers from a facial nerve disorder and has tried anti-seizure medication, anti-inflammatories, and acupuncture. I highly recommended Anti-Flam to him and he noticed an immediate reduction in pain. I have started to recommend it to anyone who suffers from chronic pain--it is a life changer!"
4,Matt's review,I read Bull Rider by Marilyn Halverson. I liked the book because it had a lot of cool parts in the book. I liked when Layne got bucked off a bull named Rhino and when they loaded the horse up in the back of the truck and the horse fell out because these party animals drove and shouted out the window. This story is about a boy that wants to become a professional bull rider but his mom won't let him. His mom won't let him because his father died riding. I think the person who would like this book is someone who likes action and bull riding.
2,boring,I did not like this book. If you really like reading about what happen all during the trial then you will.I don't.Patricia Springer is a good author but this one book was very dull & boring.Just about 3/4 of the book is the trial. She tells you about the child gone missing & the arrest & then it is the trial totally.This man was suspected in 2 rapes & three murders.
3,Dull prose with good intentions,"Author Patricia Springer tried her best to relay the murder of eleven year old Stephanie Flannery. And while I wanted to see justice prevail, I couldn't do it.I wasn't able to make it to the end of this book- which would be the sentencing. I knew he was executed, and that's all I needed to know. Springer does a decent job telling the stories of the primary players in this tragedy - McGinn, McGinn's first wife, McGinn's family, Stephanie, and Stephanie's mother. Stephanie did not have an easy life- she had family problems. Her last home, provided by McGinn, was horribly primative. Somehow, though, Springer shows us the story of a little sixth grader who played the flute and loved to take walks. Springer did an average job going through the investigation and the judical process, but the narrative fell flat."
3,Gives the reader more questions than answers,"When I first saw the book come out, I at first thought that it would not have a lot of good to say about Ricky McGinn(my family & his became acquainted through a cousin of mine who knew Ricky on death row)and the case in general. After finishing the book, I realized that the narrative provided numerous inconsistancies about the case(the missing rape kit, the handling of the body & the investigation two notable examples) and I hope that whomever reads this book will also come to the same conclusion that I have: The case against Ricky Nolan McGinn was a total fabrication. Hopefully others will also come to the same conclusions that I have and someday the truth will come out about who really murdered Stephanie Flannery."
2,GRRRRRRRRRR,"It's the only radiator I could find and it has PLASTIC top and bottom, which I KNOW will crack in about two to three years! I HATE THIS PURCHASE BUT I HAD NO ALTERNATIVE! If you can find an all aluminium radiator pay what ever extra and do it, you will save a lot more money long term. Unless your screwing people over in resell or trade in, then that's up to you. For me even I would invest in the well being of others! HATE THIS PLASTIC!Product fit, no problem with installing, looking at trashing my car, simply because I won't be able to depend on this part. PLASTIC %^$%$&#"
4,"OK, but not the same","I enjoyed the walk down nostalgia lane. I was hoping to find them at a price in line with soft drinks like they were years ago in the grocery stores.The assortment is OK, but missing some of the flavors I remember as a kid and has some more 'exotic' fruit flavors. I remember cola, orange, lemonade, and root beer but that is all."
2,Not like it used to be...,"Mom told me these were great when she was a kid, they just don't make 'em like they used to. There are better things to spend your money on..."
1,Fizzies fizzes out,I can see why these were once banned. They taste awful. I loved them as a kid. No more. Number one is the fact there is no warning about the incredible amount of sodium in this drink. No one over 35 or 40 could drink this. Not good for the little ones either. They do not dissolve unless you use hot water first. Then of course they taste awful. The postage is a rip off. A terrible product and a terrible price.
1,no fun anymore,"Like many other people, we have fun memories of making Fizzies as children. I recently came across them and bought a package in root beer flavor. They were just disgusting.. as someone else said earlier, it tasted like soap or worse. Save your money and your memories!"
2,Why These Flavors?,"Wasn't a fan of three flavors. The lemonade and orange flavors are pretty good, though. Just wish they had the cherry cola and grape flavors as an assorted box"
2,Hardly no fizz,I came across these after using Alka Seltzer Cold cherry flavor and thought 'somebody' should make a drink without the cold medicine. This is the right idea but they really don't taste that good and for a product called 'fizzies' I'd expect more fizz!
3,Has Flavor But The Fizz Is Weak,"Unlike the Fizzies of my childhood, these did produce a favorful drink, but you need to wait a rather long time for the fizzing to work. Don't know if it is because the formula is now diet conscious but I had planned to surpise some older family members with them. Glad I didn't because the rapid fizzing is gone."
4,Great no sugar drink!,"I found these Fizzies soda drink tablets at the Cracker Barrel Store ($2.49 for a 12-pack) and I'm hooked. I've been drinking diet pop (soda) for a while, but the fizz is way too much for me. I like that these don't have sugar in them and only have 5 calories.I bought the root beer flavor and I wasn't expecting much. I was hoping that they didn't taste weird and surprisingly they don't (they actually taste like a root beer, albeit not a very strong one). The taste isn't overwhelming, but I did make my first cup with 12oz of water (instead of the recommended 8oz of water). The fizz is there, but it's not so bad that you have to burp or anything. I love these and I will certainly be buying more of these again. I want to try all of the different flavors!"
5,FUN FUN FUN!! Having a blast sharing Fizzies!.,"My husband remembered Fizzies when we saw them on Unwrapped. I looked for them online found and ordered them!! Fantastic, we are having so much fun sharing them with the little ones in our lives. He loves sharing a piece of his childhood, and watching the excitement as the children discover the same joy he remembered. Parents enjoy the Vitamin C as a bonus to the children FUN!!Thank YouMelody"
4,JUST LIKE THE MOVIE!!!!,Beleve me when I say THIS GAME ROCKS!!! I've seen the movie and I think the game is just as good!
5,The Final Countdown,"Do not start this book unless you have plenty of reading time. The phrase ""hard to put down"" is an understatement. For most of us, we watched the events of April 29, 1975 unfold on our TV sets. Author David Butler not only watched, but was also a participant in the final hours of the American Presence in Vietnam. His eyewitness accounts are both gripping and detailed. He has also collected and researched numerous first-person accounts from those who were in Saigon during those last hours.The North Vietnamese Army made thier final push at 4 AM and in the process cut off the only available airfield. The only means of escape from the siege would be a massive evacuation using helicopters. While reading these accounts, you can feel the tension and confusion along with countless other emotions of those involved. A Hollywood script could never compare to this real-life drama. The Vietnam War was a long road in American History. The Fall of Saigon was the last milestone."
1,Alice Faye deserves better,"To anyone looking at this book for information it is quite impressive. People giving these rave reviews aaasume the information in the book is correct. Anyone who knows about Alice Faye would know that the information in this book is unreliable. There is a mistake of some kind on almost every page. The author was given a wealth of information/corrections to work with but he and the publisher were more interested in getting it done now than getting it done right. It's a shame that people refer to these so-called ""reference books"", assume what their reading is fact, and the mistakes get copied over and over. To sum it up - opportunity lost. A big let-down for people who love Alice Faye. The book to find, although not as broad in scope, is ""The Alice Faye Movie Book"" (aka ""The Films of Alice Faye""). It was written by someone who actually saw every film."
1,"better than nothing,but not by much","well its a rifle case but thats all. its a blowmold hard plastic case that is not flexible if you have a bolt action or scope that sticks up, you can close it with some effort getting it open i had to use force the latches open, and of course hard plastic does not flex so the first time i broke one latch then threw the whole thing in the trash. buy the doskosil or the gunguard more expensive but worth it if you take care of your stuff."
1,Can you tell the lies.....,"For someone who writes about the lies of paganism, the author sure doesn't mind writing a whole book of lies himself! I found this book to be disqustingly biased. It's a great book I suppose if you enjoy teaching intolerance, lies, and prejudice to people."
1,Bigotry and Ignorance,"Typical of the Extremist Religious Reich agenda of today. This does not speak for the beliefs of most Christians, only the ones that refuse to hear the Bible's words for themselves. Blood libel, hatred, intolerance, propaganda, and outright lies fill this work of trash. Save your money for something real on the subject from Bob and Gretchen Passantino/Zondervan Books: Guides to series."
4,The one and only way,"While the title may seem direct, the point of this work is that we too easily in the evangelical world allow a ""hollowed out"" gospel to substitute for the one and only way. This not only undermines God's glory; it also silences his people. This book has something to offer anyone interested in thinking about where America is today. It will challenge the reader to explore-- ""who do you worship, what do you worship?"" The work is clear, concise and nonthreatning. There are five chapters, each devoted to explaining a different point of view from the world's perspective, followed by a corresponding chapter showing the Christian perspective. At the end of each chapter are thought provoking questions that include biblical verses to support the author's conclusions. These questions make the book a good resource for small group discussion. This could be a book you would want to give out to friends who have a worldview inconsistent with the Gospel Truth."
3,Very Weak.,"In comparison with other books he has written, I found this one to be very superficial. I wouldn't recommend it."
2,Censorship and poor story choice,"1. Executions are censored. The gaming industry took precedant over the First Amendment and caused RockSt*r games to chicken out and create kiddie executions. Manhunt 1 is now MUCH more violent than Manhunt 2.2. The first game told the story of a man being constantly watched, forced to murder to become free, and eventually getting revenge. The second game tells the story of a man who gets freedom but goes looking for why he was experimented on. You don't get the feel of fear, since your character could leave at any time and be safe. Bleh.ROCKST*R! RELEASE THE ADULT VERSION. That's the only way to save this game."
3,Good Game,"Pretty good game, but it's a shame about the censoring that was implemented. You can fix it if you want, but you might just be better off getting the PSP version."
3,Manhunt 2,"A Walk Through LifeManhunt two is no way near as good as the first one it's an average game and what spoils it is the executions. On the first one you could see them clearly but on Manhunt 2 the kills are all distorted. At the end of each level you do not get a rating like you did on the first one this takes some of the thrill out of the game, I was anticipating a much better sequel."
5,ManHunt 2 for Playstation,"This must be a great game...my son rarely leaves his room long enough to even eat, let alone anything else. We have to pry him away from his computer!"
1,Very Disappointed,I bought and played the 1st Manhunt game---LOVED it!!! (yeah I'm a little twisted). The overall quality was awesome and the character dialog cracked me the hell up!!!! This game is very disappointing. I got bored with it almost immediately and I'm haveing a hard time playing it again. Hate to say it but I think I wasted my hard earned $$$$!!!!
2,An okay game,Game has some good action in it. Lots of blood and gore which makes it a pretty good action game. It was very entertaining. Lots of short videos throughout the game that were very awesome and somewhat funny. But yeah for the price i recommend this game to those who like action horror in one game.
4,ps2 game,The game was delivered in great condition also in a timely manner. Both very important to me concidering that this was my first internet purchase.
