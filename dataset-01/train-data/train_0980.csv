1,never received it,it downloaded but didnt work. I tried different ways but still didnt work. There is no way to return it
2,Kindle Version is a Mess!!,The Kindle version of this book is almost unreadable in parts. The tables that apparently exist in the original arrive on the Kindle unformatted and makes no sense whatsoever... just a string of numbers. It was free so I gave it two stars instead of one.
4,New Boy Band Ready To Be Discovered in America!,"Basically this CD is what you would call part of the Boy Band Pop Rock era. Touch√© is like Backstreet Boys, N Sync, 98 Degrees, LFO, and those other pop bands, but personally I think they're a lot better. They're know well in Germany, and I hope soon they'll be discovered here in America! This is a MUST buy if you love those other boy bands!"
5,Great Product,"I purchased this product for small project, and it works great, but don't expect it to cut 1/8"" metal without comsuming a lot of air. but for small projects its a good tool to have. I found it to be great for cutting bolts and thin sheet metal, Great to have in your tool box. I do recommend it to all users."
2,Hilarious except for the S Leone bit in the middle,"What you see is what you get - there is a scene in the middle with a family scurrying across the village square under the bell tower, could be out of any other film - fantastic - acting wooden - historical accuracy, who cares.If you collect all things Che it is another item to add to the hoard."
2,George Foreman Grill Review,"Have not had much luck with the grill. The meats, such as hamburgs, chicken breast, and steaks have been undercooked. I have had better luck with broiling."
5,Quick Shipping and Great Price,I got this blade quick. It was exactly as the seller said it would be. Will buy from again.
3,Avery practical guide for the manager,This book presents global experience and provides complete support with fundamental guidance for each stage of corporate transforming.
5,You have GOT to hear this!,"This is an incredible album. It's hard to imagine anyone who wouldn't like it. I've had the very good fortune of seeing this band perform live, and let me tell you, everyone from those who like hip hop and rap to those who like country, and yes, those of us who like rock and roll enjoyed the show. The music appeals to your emotion, the lyrics are relevant, and the whole package is just unbelievably great. This is one of those CDs you buy, and you're more than happy to discover that you like every, single song!"
5,Stunning alt rock,"Incredible album start to finish for those in the rock/alt rock/pop rock space. Both the highly talented singing and songwriting flow throughout, and the beginning-to-end story being told is both depressing yet uplifting at the same time. Some very very catchy melodies. Found, Began, and Make could all be radio worthy. Have a listen from a strong and totally independent band from Arizona."
2,I agree with Aaaarrrggh from Seattle,"I have to say 2 things first...I love Indian food and have several Madhur Jaffrey books and love them...I also enjoy vegetarian dishes, though I am not a vegetarian...sounded wonderful!!! What even sounds more wonderful is looking over the book (very well laid out, I must say though) and reading the recipes...they sound wonderful and you want to make all of them. The problem is they don't taste at all as good as they sound..they just don't work. I wonder if there was any test tasting done or they were just simply complied on the basis of the author and the way the recipes sound. Save your $$$$$"
4,This Cookbook is Inspiring and Educational,"I used my local library's copy of this book before buying. When I first started eating vegetarian, a lot of ingredients and ways of thinking about food seemed weird and unfamiliar - but the way you learn, is to DO. :-) Fifteen years later, as a well-seasoned vegetarian, I think this book is a wonderful complement to the vegetarian cook's library. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I would have liked to see a lot more pictures; but the pictures that she *does* have in there are very helpful, showing different types of rices and grains, for instance. This book moves ""American"" eaters out of their comfort zones, for sure. Borrow it from the library first if you aren't sure about it, but I personally love this cookbook. The only sort of person I imagine would NOT like this cookbook is someone who really does prefer their food to be bland and boring. I also really enjoy reading the personal anecdotes she includes with a number of the recipes."
5,The Ultimate Veggie Cookbook,"This cookbook is perfect for people who liketo cook vegetable preparations. The authorpresents very detailed recipes for virtuallyevery kind of bean in creation; namely,Azuki, Garbanzos, Fava, Mung, Soybeans,and Urad.Here is a sample recipe for Star Fried Azuki beanswith Green Pepper from Yunnan, China:o Red Azuki beanso Black Mushroomso Scallionso Garlic Cloveso Green Peppero Soyo Sesame Oilo sugar ( I prefer ground Anise for diabetics)All-in-all , the book is an excellent choice.There are areas where readers can improvise on therecommended ingredients to customize meals toindividual needs."
3,"I'm in the minority, but...","Ok, so I'm in the minority here, but this book isn't great.First the positives: she provides great information on the different ingredients and there are a ton of recipes using pretty much any ingredient you might have in the fridge.The negatives: the food lacks flavor. My husband is an Indian vegetarian (who, sadly, is a terrible cook), so I thought it would be nice to have a bunch of interesting dishes explained for a western audience. While a westerner can definitely cook these dishes, they're pretty boring, even for me. I have mainly made the bean and lentil dishes, and while they were edible, they were not repeaters."
5,YUM!,"This cookbook will go a long way in enhancing my vegetable offerings, both main courses and side dishes. We usually have lots of produce from our garden in the summer and new ways to prepare it are always welcome."
4,"Good, but....","I'm biased, because I'm a college student with a limited budget, and limited kitchen/pantry space, but I'm always struck by how many ingredients most of the recipes call for! This book is still valuable, if just because it explains the theory behind the cooking (a tarka vs. tigannissi, for example, as a way to flavor lentiles), and I'm so glad to have it on hand because of its explanations for beans and grains. But most of the full recipes require pretty intense grocery shopping to do properly."
5,deliciously practical,"I first bought this book for myself because I loved Madhur Jaffrey's ""Taste of India."" I have used various recipes and passed those on to other people. The Korean Tofu Salad is requested by even my carnivore husband of the once-conservative tastebuds. I have given this book to various friends, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. All of them have been thrilled. I even love reading it as if it were a novel. Thank you Mrs. Jaffrey."
4,Great Variety,"This is my second favorite vegetarian cookbook, after Moosewood Restaurant Cooks at Home. I have several of Madhur Jaffrey's cookbooks and I always find that preparation instructions are easy to follow, the recipes work as described, and that her suggestions for substitutions or variations are right on the mark. This book is particularly enjoyable to browse, as the recipes are broken into sections (vegetables, grains) then sorted based on the dominant ingredient (cauliflower, pasta). If you buy this book, you will find that you can cut the amount of oil recommended for most recipes to 2/3 or 1/2 of the suggested amount and things will still come out fine. Many of the recipes can be used as side dishes if you need to cook for a meat-eating crowd. There are no ""duds"" in this book as far as I can tell."
3,Great Recipes BUT . . .,"This author is so well known to the Culinary World, it's hard to avoid her. So I bought this book thinking I'm going to incorporate more vegetarian dishes into my life, well . . . I haven't even cooked out of it yet! Buyer beware, unless you are going to really cook out of this on purpose, its not for the curious cooks!What I do appreciate about this book is her endless and useful (!) information on each of the food sections she has. The section on BEANS is fascinating on its own!"
3,Library of Sonya Armfield,This book was interesting because it offers a different perspective of Malcolm X. Its good to read this book with the autobiography of Malcolm X.Sonya Armfield
4,"Good Reading, but Needs More Relevant Maps/Illustrations","This was a concise and quite interesting summary of a man who conquered a half of the world. A good attempt was made to examine Genghis Kahn the man, and not get caught up in technical and mechanical details. However, it would've been even nicer if the book contained more maps and relevant illustrations to enliven its content. E.g., a map showing the routes that he and his generals took from Gobi to Persia would be have been a fascinating illustration, a map showing who conquered which territory would've been good, too."
5,A home run!,"I'm not an Angels fan. I'm a Yankees fan and what I want to know is why MY team doesn't have a kickass book like this. With his fast-paced, tightly-written countdown to victory, Fox does the seemingly impossible. He makes the Angels look like the Yankees. And for that, I tip my pro cap to him."
5,Big A,Great introduction for new fans to the history of the Angels and a great rememberance for long time Angel Fans. It was a fun read because you could just tell that the Author is an Angels fan.
3,"The Highflying Angels: Their 50 Greatest Hits, Pitches and Plays","I can admit it now, but for a long period of my life, it was quite painful: I'm an Angels fan. Have been since the days of Bo Belinski. That's why I was delighted to see Bucky Fox's addition to the history, lore and trivia of my beloved Angels -- be they of Anaheim or Los Angeles. His book is crammed with stuff I didn't know or, in many cases, had forgotten. Like ""Adam Kennedy's Reggie Moment,"" when Kennedy hit three dingers in Game 5 of the ALC championship series to beat the Twins. Or the key role played by the relatively unknown pitcher John Lackey in a number of major Angel wins (Game 7 of 2002 World Series, Game 4 of 2002 ALC championship, Game 2 of 2005 AL Division series). Bucky's book is filled with this stuff.For a demented Angel fan, it's all pure gold."
2,Just Doesn't Work For Me.,"I just watched ""Faceless Killers"" and I have to say that while it's entertaining, I've also been working my way through the second season of the Swedish version with Krister Henrikssen and Lena Endre and liked it much much more. The acting, pacing, writing and stories are more engaging and the characters much more interesting. Part of this is personal as I've traveled and worked a lot in Norway and Sweden and I prefer the Swedish series for a sense of authenticity that the BBC series lacks. It's well done and Branagh is certainly a compelling actor but I guess I'd rather go with the original. I was pleased to see some familiar faces from the Swedish version as extras and in minor roles. Just as a matter of personal bias, the original also gives me a chance to brush up on my Swedish. If you don't like subtitles, you'll probably be better off watching Mr. Branagh's Wallander."
2,Not that good,"I love the books, I love Kenneth Branagh. I had high hopes for a great series. Branagh is an overwrought, over-acted Wallander. The series would have been much better if they had chosen one book and made three episodes, instead of three books three episodes. The plots suffer from a lack of time devoted to the each book, they are a bit of a mishmash. And a lot of time is spent with a brooding Wallander gazing off in the distance (Wallander is not Hamlet after all). Wallander isn't a happy guy, but he is a great detective and that is never very apparent."
4,Interesting series...but poor Wallander could sure do with a dose of anti-depressants,"While I'm not usually a fan of gloomy, moody ""entertainment,"" my husband and I became rather hooked on this series. Branaugh does an fabulous job of portraying the Wallander from the original novels by Henning Mankell. The music and scenery throughout the show really add to the appeal. In this second season, the main character, Wallander, continues his descent into severe depression, but seemingly with an overwhelming compulsion to solve the crime...generally at the expense of his already strained family relationships."
3,who done it?,"I like how the other characters done their parts, but wallander is so depressing and sad. I wondering if he is about to have a break down and most of the time I have to wonder if he'll have a breaking edge before he solves the mystery. Other wise i liked it"
2,"Disappointing, on the whole",I feel it's a shame that writers' take a good series and take it too far. Gratuitous violence for the sake of shocking the viewers is unnecessary and this show was really good before that started happening. Too bad.
4,Slow but steady wins the race,"For those who like shows like Law and Order (I do) You may find the pacing of this a little on the slow side. Stick with it. Once I got into the story I appreciated the beautiful cinematography and in-depth character developments. Some of the plot lines are a little cliche, but that is typical in the genre."
4,Just found Wallander,"Just found Wallander recently, kinda reminds me of the old, grumpy, comfy Inspector Morse. Love this series, look forward to more. Although, I would have liked to have known more about why Vanya left; she was with him for apparently 2 years (in the off-season), he obsesses over one case and she's gone! Didn't he work any cases in the previous 2 (off-season) years? BIG hole!"
5,Wallander with Kenneth Branagh,Fabulous series based on the books by Henning Mankell. Don't miss any of the Wallander episodes. Kenneth Branagh is superb as always!
2,unkind.,"In ""Faceless"" Branagh again demonstrates his superb and convincing acting, but the script is so unrelentingly unkind that I began to find it tedious. I watched to the end to prevent the possibiity of my coming back to finish it someday were I to leave it early."
1,This must be a joke . . .,"I was put onto this through the Pharyngula site. The ""histomap"" has absolutely no connection (certainly no logical connection) to ""history."" A vague sense of ""importance"" that is not only thoroughly subjective, but quite incalculable is used to ""map"" the relative relevance of various . . . what? Regions of the world? Cultures? Races?The altogether positive reviews are obviously by idiots who--insofar as they use this to teach history (!!!)--are doing massive harm to younger generations."
5,Great Chart,"In my opinion, as an interesting, informative, and truly unique chart, the Rand McNally Histomap of World History is only surpassed by Napoleon's March to Moscow by Charles Joseph Minard.I wish they would reprint it and update the chart to reflect the fall of the Soviet Union and the ascendancy of China. I would buy a new copy immediately."
4,very informative,"This is an excellent graphical display of quite alot of information. However, the meaning of the the width is unclear, and it would be nice to have an indication of how the OVERALL width should change with time."
4,Histomap of World History,"For some time now, I've been searching for a copy of the ""Histomap of World History: The Rise and Fall of Peoples and Nations for 4,000 Years"" by John R. Sparks. I know that this must have been a controversial product, but it was also very useful as a starting point for discussions on the flow of time and the impact of different civilizations. This diagram has been out of print for some time, and now people who own copies of this chart are selling them on e-bay for progressively higher prices. Rand McNally should consider publishing an updated version based on the book ""The World is Flat"" by Thomas L. Friedman. It would be fantastic if they could offer a set of all three maps -- the original 1952 version, an update 1990 version, and the new ""World is Flat"" version."
5,"Yes, we know it's great, but where can we get one?","If anyone knows of an outlet that still carries copies of the Histomap, please post the information."
3,Fun at first...,"This game is fun at first. Then, you get the idea, and it wears off. This is definitely NOT a party game, as each turn takes one minute to complete. If you have six or eight people playing, it can take six or eight minutes until your turn comes around. In the meantime, you, and the other players are just sitting around waiting. My 8 year old daughter likes to play it with me. It is educational for her. Otherwise, leave it."
2,Less than expected,I was disappointed in this game. The reviews made it sound so good! It's very easy to memorize where the pieces go as you play the game. To make it harder I suggest the board is turned 45 degrees for each turn. It would be great for kids no older than 13 or 14. It was not worth the [money]it cost with tax and shipping.
2,Cheap.,The product is very cheaply made. The banana terminal is small and fits too loosely in connector on my power supply. This makes for inaccurate readings. Therefore of no value.
2,"Thin, stiff, and non-stacking","These guys are alright, but the wire is stiff (at least it's stranded, tho) and thin. Also, the banana plugs cheap - the wire has a lot of 'slop' inside the jack, plus the holes thru the jacks are just there for show, they are too small to allow a banana plug (even a higher-quality, more flexible plug) to seat inside.I won't say don't buy these (they're certainly usable), but be aware that you get what you pay for, and here you're paying for cheap cables."
2,Ask question before buying,"As I recall these test leads were listed as a buy together with test meter. However, they do not plug into the meter I selected, so buying them was a waste of money. You need to call or somehow verify that they will work with your meter of choice."
2,Banana jacks don't seat correctly,"I got these test leads to go with a benchtop multimeter I have. The banana jacks don't seat very well, so any readings I try to make jump around wildly with the intermittent contact. I've tried plugging them in really hard with no benefit. As a consequence, these leads were pretty much a waste of money for me. They're too cheap to send back so they just sit around. I might try bending the metal in the middle of the jacks to make them wider. That might help. I don't recommend these."
4,Great,It was everything I was hoping for. They fit my meter and are of decent quality. It would have been nice it they were a bit longer.
1,Cables,"These cables are nice, but they're not the ones advertised in the picture.The ones i received can't have stackable plugs. These are okay, but I was expecting something else. These plugs must sit at the top of a stack of connectors and nothing can be plugged in on top.I'm leaving the seller 1 star as this is simply unacceptable to me. I'm not interested in returning my cables for a 6 dollar refund or for the correct cables. That's a miniscule amount of money. At such a low price, the seller knows nobody wants to deal with returns or replacements so they ""accidentally"" send us all an inferior product. They realize only a small percentage of us will return the product and the rest won't bother."
2,Not as pictured,"I was surprised by the poor quality of this product.I have bought many good products from Elenco, but this cable is a much cheaper version than the one shown in the image.The unit sent to me did not have stackable plugs like the one shown.Its a cheap Chinese product.Sorry Elenco you can do better than this.."
5,good product,"Good product.Really tired of the 20-word-minimum thing - is it really necessary?, so: Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product? Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 words."
1,these are junk,The bannana clips do not fit my brand new power supply and they are too loose. My other hight quallity clips are just fine. these are junk that's what they are. spend a bit more money and buy a decent set. that is what I did.
1,Still haven't recieved.,I still haven't recieved this order. Why can't I get a call from a person to tell me what is going on with this order?
1,"Don't separate these cables, they'll tear","These cables look decent enough. My issue is that the outer insulating material of each lead is fused together almost all the way to the base of the alligator clips (about 1 inch down). when I tried to separate the leads by slowly pulling them apart, the insulation tore to the point of no repair. (I suppose I could apply some heat shrink or electrical tape to the tear, but for a 4 dollar cable, I'll just buy a better one from someplace else). Very disappointed. Full disclosure: I have not attempted to contact the seller to rectify the issue."
2,Really small aligator clips,"I ordered these as they said ""large"" alligator clips. These are anything but large. I would really hate to see a small set."
4,Works,The overall quality lacks. No connections on them are soldered and there is no kind of stress relief on the wires. Luckily both of these issues are fixed in about 5 mins with a little solder and some electrical tape. I did a few wraps of electrical tape around each banana plug for stress relief and also a few wraps where the wire is crimped to the alligator clips after soldering them. I would prefer not to have to modify a brand new product out of the box just to improve its quality but its not that big of a deal. I was satisfied enough with it to purchase two more after receiving the first but I just cant give them 5 star after having to modify them to achieve a more standard build quality.Works with Mastech TRIPLE LINEAR DC POWER SUPPLY 30V 5A HY3005F-3 - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ISD7T6/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00
3,"Crap, but it works","The wire feels so cheap, it's disgusting. The ones I use at school are 100 times better, and I can't find an electrical hardware store if my life depended on it. When I do find one, it's $35 for 3FT ..... This test lead is cheap, but it works. Go for it"
1,DANGER!,"Shame on you for selling this junk. The clips are not even soldered on and the wire can be easily pulled loose, the protective sleave is so thin it is worthless. The connection to the meter on the black lead is 1/4"" shorter than the red, and wont stay in place in the 3 meters I tried it on.Worst pile I have ever bought, straight to the trash."
5,"""MANologues""","In this intriguing story of one man's journey through post-adolescence, the author manages to cleverly guide the reader through a series of life experiences as seen through the eyes of the proverbial MALE. This set of ""vagina MANologues"" about beer, babes, and football will take you back as you reminisce about much simpler times where a mans dreams and aspirations are often contemplated over beer, frequently destroyed by babes, and vicariously restored by that last second touchdown by your favorite football team. Well, ok, so you don't have to go back that far and the times are not all that simple, but Golf Balls are Female will definitely touch an emotional cord with the audience, as you laugh, cry, and reflect on your own experiences that so eloquently parallel the author's rendition of past experiences."
3,Sound is average,"This is an average system that is nice because it has a dock and allows you to have multiple CDs in it at once. The remote worked well, and there are a good amount of radio presets.Do not buy this stereo if you're hoping to turn your iPod into your home stereo sound system. This product unfortunately has very little bass, I thought with it being touted as a 20W system, it'd have some more powerful sound, but I think it fell short. Also, the radio reception seemed a bit flaky, stations that typically come in well always had static."
5,Early Model E30 or up to 1990 vert',"I have this on my 1989 BMW 325i convertible, its a robust hitch. fits on any diving board E30, installs pretty easily.. I think install took me 20 minutes alone.I have pulled other cars on dolleys with it, utility trailers, our fishing boat, this is no meager hitch.my only gripe is they don't include a ball, but $8 primed got me a 2"" small shank ball and Im very happy.gotta love overnight shipping for $3,99 too!amazon prime rocks"
1,jason head,very poor ratin for this item it was huge n couldnt possibly fit on anyones head i know?....but it was cool lookin just not for average human heads :(
3,Great Piece,"Its a very nice and scary mask, but its WAY too big, its has some foam inside to make a ""normal"" head to fit inside, but u end up looking like light bulb... Id recomend this for people measuring over 1.9 meters...Also, kinda pointless to remove the hockey mask, because u cant wear it there's no human head large enough to fit this mas confortable"
3,not what i thought,"well first off, your head has to about big as a globe to fit correctly, and the removable mask that seems to be cool in the picture is weak like walmart power ranger plastic mask material so its cool but the foam one i have is better.its pretty in expensive but you get what you pay for."
3,Hawkmoon: The Reluctant Hero,"Hawkmoon is another winning novel by Michael Moorcock, however it is plagued by one fatal flaw, its hero. Hawkmoon is not an uninteresting figure, but he tends to be a bit two dimensional. He constantly bemoans his fate as Champion of the Runestaff and tends to be unimaginative and slightly dim-witted. He sees the world as a black and white construct and this perception occasionally fouls his ability to make enlightend decisions.His companions Oladahn and D'Averc, are the characters that make this novel interesting. Furthermore, the marriage of magic and technology in a world that resembles our own is an excellent and intriguing touch. The novel also contains a number of references to modern society, thereby hinting at the fact Hawkmoon's Earth is a future incarnation of our own.Hawkmoon is without a doubt a good read, but it doesn't hold a candle to some of Moorcock's other novels, namely Elric, Von Bek and The Eternal Champion."
3,"Good, but not Moorcock's best.","This book continues the Eternal Champion series in the classic ""dark fantasy"" style. The lines of magic and technology are an indistinguishable blur, making for an interesting world. However, the plot flows somewhat intermittently, as the hero's efforts shift from one goal to another"
2,Seems like a waste of money,"Colors take awhile to appear.In less than 2 mo. the pen tip is crushed and frayed, like a used up marker. Board is still in good shape though.But my children (18 mo. & 32 mo.) like it so that gives it some redeeming quality."
1,Let Down,I bought this for my grandson who is 21 months old. He loves to color and I had seen the doodle pad that uses water. I thought this would be great for traveling. This isn't good for anything. His great-grandmother got him the doodle pad and he loves it. This piece of junk is junk. You have to really drowned it with water and wait for the colors to appear. I would rate this a -5 if I could.
3,"Best for very young artists, 12-24 mos.","We bought the Splash Art toy for our 18 mo. old son for Christmas. He absolutely loves it and is delighted to have his own 'pen' to write with. I was hoping for a non-messy activity for him while we're trapped inside during the winter. I got that much! As an adult, I have my own issues with it, same as others have mentioned. The pen releases way too much water, which soaks the writing surface. My son is oblivious, but I find it irritating. He doesn't care if one side doesn't dry while he writes on the other; he actually flips back and forth with abandon. I cannot see this toy working for children older than 2, who are more aware of what the toy should provide. I am also bothered by all of the markings on the packaging about the toy being made in China, references to Hong Kong, etc. I do not need to be inundated with those things! No wonder it's such a crappy toy (from a knowing adult's perspective, anyway)."
1,Terrible Toy,"This toy was a gift and it is awful. The pen leaks out too much water and makes the picture run. The ""brilliant color"" is a dull grey at best. It takes forever to dry. It makes my three year old son so frustrated we have to take it away."
4,Interesting read,This book gave me a good understanding on what Jehovah witness's believe. I was always curious what they believed and it gave me good insight.
1,Purposefully Misleading,"This book is purposefully misleading to the millions that read it as truth. It is a shame that those who really believe this are people truly seeking God and wanting to please Him. The problem is that the watchtower has knowingly mistranslated the Greek and Hebrew of the Biblical text. Do not waste your money or your time on this false teaching. Instead, look up the Apologetics Study Bible and/or other apologetic books. These will equip you to recognize these false teachings. Stay away from the JW cult because it has too many contradictions and falsehoods."
2,shallow....,i have read many of the watchtower publications and this one has got to be one of the watered down doctrinally. i thought you can live forever in paradise was a better book. it was full doctrine. maybe that is why this book is advocated by jws... people just aren't reading the Bible and are lured by shallow material.i talked to many kingdom hallers and the put an emphasis on the pictures and topical index. it's a shame that the chronology and the hermeneutics are totally messed up. what a waste of paper.
1,Best if read without a Bible handy,"I didn't have enough ink in my red pen to mark all the errors, false conclusions, and un-Biblical doctrines contained in this little tract. I got up to about page 40 before I had to stop. I just wanted to make sure that the information and teachings of this book did not conform to the clear and unambiguous teachings of scripture, and I was not disappointed. If you want to know what the Bible REALLY teaches, open it and read it, and ask God to tell you how the scripture applies to your life and what He wants you to learn. This is obviously more difficult than simply memorizing somebody else's ideas, but isn't it worth it?"
1,This book is not accurate,This book is based on an erroneous translation of the bible. The Watchtower Society changed the text of the bible to suit their beliefs. They will not tell you this but this is what happened way back when Charles T. Russell first started the WTBTS.This book is full of errors. Please do not be deceived by this book full of lies. If you wish to learn about what the Bible teaches please find a real CHRISTIAN Study Bible. You can obtain a good study bible FREE ONLINE! You can get it at the Crossroad's Initiative website at [...].You can also go to[...] to know for a fact what the bible teaches and says. Another good one is [....]. Please check those out. God bless.
1,This is a free publication that people are selling?,"I absolutely refuse to even read this book, it was left for me by the Jehovah's Witnesses. I will stick to reading my HOLY BIBLE thank you. I would rather read truth than watered down garbage dreamed up by a cult. Recycle your copy today!"
5,AMAZING!,"This book is amazing! It absolutely explains the bible in such a great, detailed way. And by the way, if your still a little hesitant or skeptical, compare the bible verses in the book with your very own bible! It will say mostly everthing the same! It will help anyone get closer to God and learn more of his purpose for humanity and this system of things. It explains many questions we have all been yearning to get answered like, why does God permit suffering?, whats God's name?, it answers questions about death, and if a hell truly exists. But again you can get this book for FREE!!!!!!!!!!!! Next time a Jehovah's Witness goes to your door ask them for one and they'll gladly give you one!"
4,Sexy shoes,I have never seen another woman out with these shoes on. They are really cute but the beading detail is delicate. I would recommend taking the shoes off while you drive.
1,Inaccurate,"This book is not only unremittingly malicious in tone,but well known as being inaccurate, sloppily put together,and a book whose author clearly had an agenda in depictingPaley as some kind of monster of evil. A bad book thatleaves you feeling bad."
2,Fairly weak product,"I found this to be a fairly weak product. It is thin and needs to use about 2X other products that I have used. It's recommended usage is 1oz/gallon which, for me, gives about four 4-gallon buckets for a whole bottle. It seems gentle enough as well, but I've used better. To me, it is really not much better than a high quality ""bulk"" car wash.I would say P21S Bodywork Conditioning Shampoo is vastly better (more concentrated and more gentle) and if ultimate gentleness is not a priority, then the Finish Kare 1016 is better (and cheaper) which provides some anti-static properties and polymer wax. Now that's a high tech wash."
5,Calling Lady Luck,"Fun to look at on the outside, and fun to play on the inside. For the uninitiated, here's the scoop: JINX is a by-word for `I am in trouble now'. So do what you can to get Lady Luck on your side. Wear your lucky socks, grab your lucky charm, and kiss the dice before every roll. Just don't expect much sympathy from others if you do get JINXED - believe me, it can get pretty heated at times!!!! I love games of chance, and this one takes the cake. Suspense is always in the air. Just a game? Yeah right!"
1,"Cheap, Cheap, Cheap","This game is worth $2. It consists of only a small gameboard, a handful of cheap pawns, and 2 dice. Total manufacturing cost must be well under a dollar.It has a black die and a white die. The board has a grid with white die values on the first axis, and black die values on the other. You simply place your pawn on the grid where the die values dictate. There is no skill involved. The only possible educational benefit of this game is that kids might learn how to find spots on a grid, a sort of Battleship-trainer, if you will.My 5, 6, and 8 year-old children quickly tired of the game, and it was all I could do to finish a single round. Tedious, tiring and boring."
3,Just ok...,"Jinx is a great game if you have just a few minutes and want to keep the kids busy. The good thing about it is there is absolutely no skill involved, all moves are decided by the roll of the dice, so my 5 kids ages 3-13 can play together and nobody has an advantage. It's definitely not a favorite in our house, but the kids do get it out about once a week."
1,Awful,This is just plain stupid. No fun at all. The quality of the little board is cheap and I regret having paid good money for it. It will be going to the thrift store tomorrow.
1,Boring. No skill or strategy required. Cheap board,"My family played this game exactly once and put it back on the shelf, most likely for good.The problem with this game is that it's purely a game of chance. There's nothing to celebrate when you win, no rivalry between players, and we felt nothing but relief when it ended. The game's physical design is interesting, and I'm sure a more engaging set of rules could make it worth your time. As it is, Connect Four is one example of a much more entertaining alternative."
5,A Great Game for everyone,Jinx was one of those rare finds where everybody playing was having a blast. The game moves so quickly that it kept everyone on their toes. Watch out --- you might be JINXED -- so pay attention and role the dice!
2,Disappointing,"I hoped that this mobile version of Filemaker would be up to the standards of Filemaker 5, but it fell far short. FM mobile allows you to transfer only 20 fields of your database. Furthermore, you can't transfer calculation fields and you can't use pop-up menus.There's probably more that can't be done, but I returned it before I could find out. FM Sync/JFile is a sync/database application that allows more fields and doesn't have the other limits of Filemaker mobile."
1,Gin Rummy Game has some flaws,"I bought this Gin Rummy game to replace one from Radio Shack that I wore out, and they don't make anymore. This game has only a few different hands, and repeats them over and over. It does not take long to memorize them and know exactly what the score will be and who will win each hand. Also, it sometimes will not let you win when you have a winning hand. For example, in one hand I had 4 10's and 8,9,J,Q&K OF the same suit. It would not allow the 10 of that suit to be played in the straight. Itstead, it kept it with the other 3 10's to make a set of 4. Therefore, the 8 & 9 were not playable when it should have been. Also, I would prefer to keep the sound off all them time, but this game requires you to turn the sound off each time a new game begins."
1,wanzingi,"It's not gin rummy but a version all of it's own with it's own built in refusal to allow the player to accomplish moves that are usually in gin rummy, giving the player no options to accomplish true gin rummy plays and the advantage only to it's built in software. If you like to play gin rummy DON'T BUY IT."
4,I wish it weren't made in China,"It would get 5 stars from me if it weren't from China. But it is just what I wanted so I'll keep it. It is simple to operate.When did alarm clocks become high tech? My last alarm clock, purchased because my 30 year old clock radio died, was a nightmare. I couldn't figure out how to get it set they way I wanted. I thought I had it right but it either didn't go off, or went off at random. The controls were almost impossible to see, and were so touchy I seemed to have changed settings without knowing it.In this little gem, the controls can be seen and manipulated with older eyes and fingers not adapted to tiny controls. It does what I think it is going to do, that is go off at 6:00 am with the station I selected. The red display doesn't light up the room. It is also very inexpensive, but I would have paid more for one not made in China, if I could have found one with the same features."
1,This clock radio is good only for providing the time,I do not recommend this product if you're looking to use the radio of this item. The reception and sound on this radio is unbelievably bad. I've put the radio in every room in my house trying to see if the reception would improve but it did not. This is the second time I've purchased a product made by Coby. I purchased a Coby DVD player 3 years ago and it did not work from the day I pressed the power button. I had hoped that their products' performance may have improved since then but I now see that it has not. I'm now saying goodbye to Coby products forever.
4,It does it's job.,"I needed a small compact clock for my room as I was tired of finding my cell phone to see the time.... So I got one of these as it was cheap and compact looking.I cant comment on the alarm clock function as I use my cell phone for that, or for the radio, as I have my own stereo system.... Hence only 4 star.Other than that, it's sturdy, small enough to fit in the spot I wanted it to, but not too small that I have to strain my eyes to see the time.For $5.99 and promotional 4 for 3 deal, I think it's a great value for the price."
4,Great shooting game for kids and Adults. Highly recommend.,wild West Target game is a Fun game for kids and adults - highly recommended for the whole family.
1,Bad Deal,The item did not work and it comes with only half the batteries....If you have to return it be prepared to pay shipping a second time because there isnt an exchange you have to reorder the item!
4,Super Fun,I bought this shooting set for my 4 year old nephew for his birthday. He loved it! The adults at the party even enjoyed it. Hours of fun and enjoyment for everyone.
1,Junk,"Product did not work, Buttons would not release to pop cans, used new batteries, at any distance, could only get one to pop one time after twenty tries."
2,Not as good as it looks,"I was so excited when I purchased this for my 5 year old son, thinking it would be a great way to spend some cold winter afternoons. However, it is still sitting in the same place he unwrapped it nearly a month ago. Although the directions clearly tell you how to shoot and aim appropriately, they are a bit flawed. The gun is not ""calibrated"" to send the infrared beam to the can or bottle. Nothing happens when you aim for the bottle, can, or log. In order to hit the target, you must aim at the bottom edge of the log resting against the table or floor. Once you aim there, you can knock it off every time. Thus, there is nothing realistic about trying to hit the target. Once we showed him where to aim to hit the target (essentially, the floor), the game lost its magic because that makes no sense to a 5 year old. What fun is it to aim at the floor and have a can on a log fly off? Great idea, just not so well made..."
1,Such a waste.,"I bought two of these for my twin nephews' birthday. They are easily the worst games I have ever purchased! One of them barely works, and the other doesn't work at all. There are other similar games out there that actually function. PLEASE learn from my mistake and don't waste your money on this toy!"
4,Exceeded expectations!,"Bought this for our son for Christmas. I was a little skeptical when we ordered it, but it actually works really well and the distance on it is pretty impressive. We set it up the full length of the hall and we were knocking off the cans at about 40 feet. (Yes, I admit it - I did say we. I have enjoyed playing with this with him.)"
5,Mystery Log!,"I bought this mystery log at Goodwill yesterday. No idea what it was. No gun, no bottles, no batteries, but it had a speaker and some buttons, so I figured it did something neat.Turns out, you don't really need a gun or bottles for the mystery log to be fun. A television remote will trigger the targets and launch whatever you have on hand. We used a little wooden tree and some plastic dinosaurs and used the remote control to launch them into the air, pretending there was a giant earthquake and that's what killed the dinosaurs NOT the Ice Age. Still fun. We're going to try it with cheetos as soon as we go buy some cheetos. Five stars."
4,fun for all,Daddy liked it just as much as the 6 year old.An attention getter for all! And great sound effects!Especially the broken glass sound......my favorite.
1,Not worth it,"My son was so excited when he got this but it doesnt work. It makes noises some times but that is it. The only times the ""cans and bottles"" jump was when the gun was 2 or less inches away. Very disappointed"
3,Fun but requires patience,"This has a great concept however the execution of the product lacks user ability. You have to be lined up perfectly, placing the cans at the perfect distance and perfect height for the cans to go off. It claims it works at a great distance, but I do not believe that to be true, it is a kids game so lining it up perfectly probably isn't a great set up"
4,target shooting set,"These work real well. Just the age group is a bit off. This seems like its more for a small small child. More of toddler age. I say that only because it really doesn't explode like we thought, it just falls apart in 2 pieces. No biggie. It makes noise, but nothing special. You have to hit below the target as well, just to make it work. So the aim isn't officially right.Its well made and I could see a younger child (toddler to maybe age 5) have lots of fun with it. But any older than that and it gets boring. Just our experience. But its well made!!! Does what it says it does."
2,Disappointed,Within the 4th time using the one or more of the buttons would either not press down or would not come up. I would have to play around with a screw driver to push up or down. Very disappointed.
1,Was thrilled when we received it but....,"My son was so excited when he got this. We put in the batteries, in the gun and the log, and nothing. No sound, no static, nothing. So, we are in the process of returning. Hopefully we can get another one and it will work."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,My two sons both bought this at the store with their own money. I thought for sure it would not work or fall apart soon after buying it. I was pleasantly surprised! Its been a number of months and my kids still take it out to play with it. It is durable even with being kicked/tossed around. Someone mentioned that the TV remote sets this off and it does. We found out the hard way and completely freaked out a guest staying in our bonus room trying to turn the channel on the TV!I would definately recommend this toy.
3,Partly Works,"This toy is a fun concept. My son loves seeing the cans fall off the log. Problem is, the toy only worked fully for a few shots. Now, only the right side will pop off the cans and the left side makes noise but nothing happens. We aren't returning it only because there isn't an exchange available and my son likes the gun."
4,Fun,"My kids and I have enjoyed this - first time I orderd, it did not work, but I returned it and ordered a new one and it has been a lot of fun"
4,Where have you been?,"This was one of the best Christian Rap Groups. They really kept it ""REAL"" Not some of this watered down stuff we hear from our Christian rap artist who seem to be scared to give Jesus the glory in their songs.Bruthaz Grimm put out something new!!!"
4,"""Pleased"", but...","These are pretty nice, and relatively comfortable, but to me the whole concept of a ""sandal"" or slide is that it should be quick and easy to take on and off... and this shoe is definitely designed with slimmer feet in mind. Though I can get them on, I find that the plastic cuts into the top of my foot if I wedge myself in too much. Consequently, I have to wear these with my heels just barely at the heels of the shoes if I'm barefoot. I know it's not a shoe size problem as they are otherwise fine, and I've never had this sort of issue with others... oh well. A simple pair of stockings or thin socks works just fine to remedy this.Other than that, one thing I particularly like about these is that the heel is more...robust than I had expected. In other words, they are not quite as perilous as spike/stiletto heels, despite the height. I feel relatively grounded and don't have to watch my steps quite as carefully."

3,test lead,"Transaction was fine and shipped quickly, but the minigrabbers on the cable was pretty cheap looking. They appear to be functional though."
5,Nice probes..........,High quality probes. Worked well and price was right. Unit I ordered came with alligator clip type....these are much more secure and worked very well.
4,"Works, but inspect connectors","One of my BNC connectors arrived with one of the internal connector fins slightly bent. All I had to do was push it back into place and it worked fine, but do not try and force it onto a connector. If it doesn't slip right on check for an obstruction."
1,Cheap,Cheap then again what do you expect for a few dollars. It does the job but going into the Megahertz range shielding is a problem. Should have paid a bit more and get a much better quality.
3,inexpensive but slow,"sent what i ordered, but it took a while. good place if you are not in a hurry."
4,"Amusing truths of the commong ""drugstore""","Enjoyable light reading, this book has many little known facts that will astound professionals as well as the general public. Vince Staten remembers well a slowly fading side of Pharmacy. Slightly superficial, but not meant to be anything but entertaining. All in all, excellent."
3,Opposite Action Review,Good content and very useful. Could be a little longer for the price.At 23 minutes....it is very short.
1,Flimsy!,"I bought a bunch of these to use with power supplies in my classroom. On the first day, one of the wires pulled out of the banana connector, and several of them snapped off! I've been teaching physics for over 20 years, and I have never had this problem. Also, quickly, the teeth of the alligator ends started not lining up. Just too flimsy all around."
4,Functional,It was cheap; I got what I payed for. Isn't overly impressive but seems to do the job. Not sure what else you can say for something like this.
2,HTC charging cradle,"Spare battery charges in normal time, but if you dock your phone, the battery in the phone takes triple the time (no joke) to charge. Annoying LED lights, that flash and are too bright. You can't connect external speakers to your phone while in the cradle. So, if you use your phone as a music player, then you only have the internal speaker. Can't use the radio function due to no wires to act as antenna. Item was returned."
1,I've never seen a garbage like this before,I don't know why Dr. Chow put this garbage in his series.
5,Just what I needed,This is just the size shower arm I needed and this is where I found it cheapest. Good quality too!
5,"Looks good, works great","The shower system we purchased came with an 8"" arm - too short, so we needed a replacement. This one was reasonably priced, looks good, and I got it quickly with my Prime account."
3,Problem with the color,"We purchased this item to go with a separate showerhead made by Kingston. Unfortunately the color of the ""oil rubbed bronze"" was more brown than the showerhead so we had to return it. Matched with a different showerhead, it might have worked fine."
2,True Disappointment,"I read 4-5 books a week since I do not sleep well. This was a real disappointment; unfortunately, I read the review and listened. BAD MISTAKE!"
4,Good,"Normally, I would not have watched this (it's not my genre). However, we had a paintball scenario based on the movie (it was called ""Eight Legged Spiders"" to avoid copyright problems). The scenario was fun, so I watched the movie. Pretty good movie. Not too slow. Somewhat predictable, but good for cheering on the home team. Not really gory and not littered with nudity like some others."
1,Most sickening movie ever made.....,"This was the most sickening movie ever made. Not just in effects work, but also in the terrible acting and the pathiec way Warner Brothers presented this as a summer movie when they did not have a better one or a big one to promote.This was the end result of Warner Brothers becoming an AOL/Time Warner Company, making garbage like this, and it continues to this day."
2,Eight Legged JUNK!,This a bad movie that is only interesting for it's comedy. David Arquette does a good job(as always) but that is about the only thing worth watching this. There aren't any great features either.
1,Not for those with arachnaphobia,"In all truth, I didn't really care for this movie. It probably has to do with the fact that I hate anything of the arachnid species, but there is something else to consider. Granted, the acting was actually quite good, yet there wasn't a good enough plot or script to support the actors in their endeavor, and even with some humorous scenes it just couldn't recover from that. It was a nice attempt to freshen up the material from the 1950's, 1960's, and 1970's, however if you are looking for an interesting evening watching a thriller, stick with Wait Until Dark (1967). And definitely do not watch Eight Legged Freaks if you are frightened by spiders."
2,Skip away from David Arquette,"Run away from any picture featuring David Arquette. Man, the guy is an atrociously bad actor. Every quality this movie could have (be it, fun!)is destroyed by his ""acting""."
2,Makes the toilet look like Mars Attacks!,"The graphics are great my miserable writting,, The acting is good but no logic, in my opion their is no basic diologe,.....ide strongly suggest rentin it!..."
1,Bad Movie.,This movie is so bad that I can't even describe how bad it really is. This is supposed to be a cheesy horror film with action. Instead we are bombarded with stupid dialogue and notice how they jump from scene to scene just like in soap operas. I am not going to waste anymore time on this. Bye!
3,Cool And Boring,"cool and boringa science-fiction movie that is both at the same time, boring and fun...if you want it to be more fun include popcorn"
4,Spider Camp!!,"Campy is served when the small town of Prosperity is taken over by toxic waste induced giant spiders. A fun `B' movie that might be considered scary if you have a phobia about spiders. Plenty of cheesy lines abound throughout the film and a alien conspiracy nut who doesn't want to get the dreaded `anal probe' treatment from space travelers that never arrive. Arquette plays the same character he did in the `Scream' series and Kari Wurher taking the role as a no nonsense Sheriff. Of course one of the Sheriff's kids is a spider expert and the rest of the cast acts like a bunch of bumbling fools who I would not want with me If I were under attack from regular size spiders, much less giant ones. Special effect are great, they work well in making a believable spider unlike the fake props that they pay honor to in this movie with a brief scene on the kids TV. My 9 & 11 year olds had fun with this also so grab the popcorn, kickback and enjoy!."
4,GREAT movie!,"Creepy, fun, edge-of-the-seat movie that I would never part with! I've watched it several times already. This movie made me fond of David Arquette, who I couldn't stand before I saw this movie. The characters are fun and endearing, and I love when David yells the title line of the movie out! Funny every time. Buy it if you like good, clean spookiness. It's a must have!"
4,A cool movie about HUGE spiders.,"ELF is very fun to watch. Many great sequences (especially the dirt-bike chase) and the spiders are amazingly rendered. My favorites are the jumpers, the trapdoors, and the massive tarantula. Not only that, but it mixes humor effectively with menace. If you want to freak out to the sight of giant spiders (watch on as large a screen as possible) then this is a fun time. The anamorphic / Panavision camerawork looks GREAT. The disc is loaded with lots of extra material. Again, never a dull moment and very entertaining."
2,Great Movie for my son,"My son use to watch this movie almost everyday on a *internet streaming company* then they took this movie off the instant streaming que so i had to purchase the movie. Was not pleased when with in the first 10 minutes of the movie it started skipping. It skipps 3 time threw the whole movie but never skips more than 30 seconds of the movie and my 6 yr old son doesnt notice, so he is happy either way, but i was not happy to pay for a movie that skipped."
2,"TOO MUCH SPOOF SINKS THIS ""COULD OF BEEN GREAT"" HORROR FILM","The biggest problem with this film is that it doesn't know what it wants to be. Is it a horror movie? Is it a comedy? Is it a campy spoof? It is all three,but not enough of any one of them. If they would have changed the spider sound effects to be more threatening, rather than sounding like Gizmo from Gremlins, this would have been a very scary and good movie. It seems to me the action didn't fit the sound effects and really sank this one for me. Too bad as it had a lot of potential. The short that inspired this movie ""Larger than Life"" is included on the DVD and is way better than the feature film because it takes itself a little more seriously."
2,It sucks!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the worst movie ive ever seen.david arguette(Screams 1,2,and 3)could have done better."
2,You've Got To Be Kidding Me,"Don't get me wrong! I love horror movies, science fiction movies and movies with big creatures in it. I'll even go as far as ""just"" buying a movie rather than rent it - BUT - This has to be possibly the WORST MOVIE I ever bought.I gave this movie only 2 stars. 1 for the realistic look of the spiders as they reaked havic on the citizens towards the end of the movie and 1 for my main man on the radio. He was the only actor in the movie that delivered any comedy to his lines.The rest of the acting was totally stupid and my recommendation to anyone is: If you BUY them instead of RENT... Then, don't rent it at all. Even on a Rainy Day!!!"
3,I Enjoyed Myself,"Corn ball creature feature about a small town over run by giant spiders. It reminded me of one of those 50s movies where the mad scientist turns small creatures into monsters. I had fun. At least I wasn't bored.Where's ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" for this one!"
5,Great fun for those who miss B movies,"This was probably the most fun I've ever had in a movie theater. Not a David Arquette fan, I found him quite humorous. The diologue alone made the movie great, I mean ""Shave your face, it looks like a strippers crotch"". You can't get that from The Lord of the Rings.And the Mall scenes, people running around a [poor] mid-western mall [a-la Dawn of the Dead] protecting themselves with weapons and, Lawn Furniture?If you're looking to have a good time, and not devote a lot of thinking. Definately check out this flick."
4,Larger Than Life,"Eight-Legged Freaks was inspired by a short film titled Larger Than Life (included on the disk). It is a tale of a spider museum, crickets that have been exposed to toxic waste, and a dying mining town.Crickets become toxic, crickets get fed to spider collection, spiders grow escape and terrorize. No other movie has down the swarm of giant spiders as well as this one. The effects are superb, the characters clever, and the action builds and runs non-stop.Add a prodigal son, a paranoid radio personality, a relationship revisited, greed, corruption and more giant spiders than you could ever dream of and you get a fun and wild film. Despite the subject there is little or no gore even though quite a few characters succumb to the ravenous freaks. Currently the king of giant-spider films. An absolute must see for fans of the genre."
3,Trust me; it's a comedy...,"If there's anyone over age 5 who was genuinely scared by Eight-Legged Freaks, you really need to stick with G-rated from now on.The plot is beaucoups lame, the acting equally so, the sound effects ridiculous, and the script weak. What make sthe film stand out is 1) the special effects, which are very good, and the fact that at absolutely no point in time does the film take itself seriously. That's the point. It's a tongue-in-cheek Satrurday matinee re-do, and to that end, it works well. Worth owning only if you get it ultra-cheap."
3,Fun and Good Bug Action,I don't usually like it so tounge in cheek but this one had a good action story and great spider Sp F X. I liked the radio guy and the end was okay but predictable. Had fun.
5,"It has the Sexy Scarlett Johansson. ""Super Scarlett:Super Woman.""","Scarlett Is Beautiful as ever. The story is about Giant Spiders invading this town, but the citizenry band together in order to stop these fellows. It is not gross at all, but actually quite funny! You feel like if your watching those movies from the 50's and 60's on Giant Insects. It is so cute and lovable. But like i said, Scarlett Johansson looks super incredible. Yes-Recommended!"
3,Super spiders running amok,"Tons of fun, this tongue in cheek flick has enough laughs, cartoonish death and all around feel good heroics to make it a worthy collectible for those that want a modern twist on the 1950's pulp monsters.Arquette is funny and seems to be having a good time."
2,Should've played it straight.,"I bought this dvd without having ever seen it and it was an ok movie, but they should've played it as a straight forward horror movie. It could've been great without all the extremely cartoonish sound effects, but they went for laughs and that was a mistake. As it is, this movie is ok if you have some time to waste but it is nothing special. Bottom line, it's worth watching once."
5,ITSY BITSY SPIDERS - NO WAY!!!!,"Any movie that allows its humongous spiders to ""talk"" has to have something going for it. I loved the way the spiders made little noises while in pursuit and how they did their ""ugghs"" and such when they were killed. Tongue planted firmly in cheek, EIGHT LEGGED FREAKS supplies just what you want. An update of those delightfully tacky B movies of the fifties. (Remember Leo G. Carroll getting his come-uppance in ""Tarantula?"").The movie's effects are wonderful, both chilling and hilarious. The cast is as ""bad"" as a movie like this should be. David Arquette is stonefaced and properly heroic; Kari Wuhrer is stone-faced and properly sexy; the rest of the cast does their thing in the manner to which one hopes they would.If you have a phobia of spiders, this movie definitely should get under your skin.It was fun to watch! Bring on the Milk Duds!!!!RECOMMENDED."
4,"Good, clean, hairy, web-spinning fun","An amiable and well-paced creature feature comedy, starring David Arquette as a nebbishy every-guy who has to help save his hometown from an infestation of giant, mutant spiders. The leviathan arachnids are escaped from a local vivarium, which means we get several different varieties of exotic monsters, each with their own special powers and habits (jumping, spinning giant webs, attacking from hidden trap doors, slurping out human innards like they were Icees, etc.). The special effects are great, the spiders make cute, anthropomorphized noises, and the script is funny and not to be taken seriously on any level. It's a fun film."
3,kinda weird,The Movie Is Good Which Is Why I Wanted To Rate It 5 Stars But It's Too Weird. No Way I'll Give It Credit For Comedy Like Gremlins. It's Fun And Cute.
3,Not as Pictured,"Everything arrived timely and in good condition. My only complaint was that the items were not as pictured. I was expecting to receive the vacation and celebration shape cutter templates as the picture showed, but received two different ones instead."
1,Don't bother,"This show is nothing but a soft core porn series trying really hard to be a Lord of the Rings wannabe and falling flat on it's face as it laughably attempts to be so.Do yourself a favour and rewatch Lord of the Rings, you'll be much more happier and intelligent for doing so."
1,don't get the hype,I watched the first episode and fell asleep multiple times. its like watching lord of the rings but worse. the show is too graphic too with a lot of cussing.
1,Soon?,"I have to agree with the other reviewer (Tpang). It's not released yet, so why review? I've been waiting for months and months, and still no info on a release date.Update January 2013: I put it on the hold list at my library... Cannot wait to see the second season."
2,Much Ado about Nothing,"Read first two books in series, found they pretty much fizzle out at that point, do not find the HBO series much better. Cannot recommend books or the show. Long series of books that results in a waste of my valuable time, as I sure this series looks to be if they keep making them."
2,kept pausing,The series is excellent but I could not watch it because it kept pausing. It made viewing difficult. I don't know if it is a settings issue but I could not find any help
2,hbo,great movies but it take HBO to long to release it to blue ray. In fact i still do not have it I had to get HBO to watch it
2,"Too long in waiting, price steep!",Don't have HBO but love the books and therefore the series. Season one was great so I've been waiting out for two. I'm disappointed in how long it's taken and the price point seems steep. I'm actually turned off by both HBO's delay to get the DVD out as I am of the author for the next book to come out in probably 5 years. I rather see an series made from A Wheel in Time books at least that finally will be complete in January.
2,Mistakenly watched,I was looking for the second season of the series. I watched this with no real interest and if I could have unwatched it I would have.
2,"Not the series, behind the scenes!",It is NOT the series but behind the scenes..Bait and switch it should be listed as a first look!
2,Short & Simple: No HBO or DVD or Blue-ray needed!,"It's an okay series...and I could go into detail but I'm just not going to bother wasting my time with the G.O.T. troll fans, which I'm sure would pick apart anything wrote or try to censor you for a less than a holy 5 star rating.Oh, and the main part of this 'review' is really just to say you don't need HBO or a high priced disc sets to watch it (and considering all the problems people had with the season 1 Blu-ray discs), you can go Green and just get it today at one of the million online sites, for a discounted rate or even for free. And yes, they are high quality versions out there, just as good as any overpriced deluxe packaged discs.FYI: I'm not allowed (by Amazon) to reply to any questions or comments left. And I don't want any and normally delete them...so, please go write your own review. :)"
1,"Great show, but the set is missing the digital copy code","Great show, but the set is missing the digital copy code. So it gets a low score since I'm not getting everything I paid for..."
2,Flimsy disc,"I had season one, so I wanted season two. Opened package to find disc one had a crack starting at the center hole. I was able to watch it, but I'm not sure how many times."
5,Love this series!!,"Very quick delivery, and everything came in 1 piece. One of the discs had come off of the plastic part, but everything was still fine."
5,So good!,"Why are you reading the reviews?? Best show, watch now you won't regret it. Watch the first season first though, it might be slower paced but builds up to second season"
3,Just let George R.R Martin write the scripts to every episode.,"Giving this a 3 because season 2 is awful if you've read the books like I have (there are good moments like Jaqen, Ygritte, Ironborn & Theon scenes but then you'd have character assassinations of Cat & Littlefinger (not to mention his teleporting), NotJeyne!Talisa, Ros the whore, every one of Dany's scenes as well as that House of the Undying scene) & also I discovered, when I was watching the Dragonstone featurette, that Disc 5 of the BD was scratched so it skips which sucks because it was the first thing I watched from the BD set."
1,Missing Disc 5,"I saw that another reviewer was missing Disc 3. Well, I'm missing Disc 5... What the hell is going on??"
5,Second Season of The Game of Thrones,This purchase has to be the best purchase I have made for my husband who is a BIG FAN of The Game of Thrones! I purchased the First and Second Season and will continue to purchase every Season as long as the series continues!Along with my husbands purchase I now have other family memebers who I also make these same purchases for!
3,"Don't get me wrong, I love this show, however","The product was slightly beaten up on the edges, and on the normal DVDs were a few scratches. From what I can tell, the discs are working properly, but I'm afraid of future issues. Amazon probably should be more careful with their products. I will say that it was wrapped twice, so a little extra protection there. That was a plus."
4,No Issues,"This was ordered with seasons 3 and 4. Both of those purchases arrived before this one. We are not all the way through watching season 2, but have had no issues so far."
3,Blue Ray/ DVD/ Digital Copy Nonsense,"As much as I love this series, I must admit I'm having second thoughts about purchasing the 2nd Season, at least right now.The primary reason is the pricing. I have no problem paying for something I want, but the ""bundle"" option that Blu Rays are all coming out with these days is just ridiculous. I DO NOT NEED a DVD copy nor a Digital copy, I just need the Blu Ray. The fact that they want to charge an extra 20-30 dollars to force feed me the DVDs and useless digital copy without an alternative is just too much.As for the series, the first season was better. The second season took too many liberties with the story. I know that there has to be changes for the adaptation to the screen, but it was too much. The season wasn't bad, but it wasn't as good as the first."
1,Useless!,"Too bloody and violent. Found no redeeming value. Nothing else needs to be said.When a product is this bad, why do I have to take so long to pan it?"
1,"Not HD, and no options for upgrade.","No returns, no upgrade option. All I wanted was the HD version but got excited about the price, and hit purchase before noticing that it wasn't an HD version.I'm out $40 and unwilling to shell out another $40 to Amazon to get an upgrade. I'll spend my money on a disc version from some other vendor. -1, Amazon. -1."
3,Wish it offered Castellano!,"My family was so excited when Season 2 arrived in our mailbox, but we were so disappointed when Castellano wasn't offered as a language option like the 1st season was! We are from Spain, and Castellano is the kind of Spanish spoken there, and it's very different than the Spanish spoken in Latin America! It doesn't sound as smooth or fluent as Castellano! I hope they'll add Castellano again to the 3rd season when it comes out on DVD!"
4,Loving It,"I thought I read the second season was a bit more over the top than the first, but halfway through and I'm enjoying it. Seems a good balance. It definitely captured the book ... it's been several months since I read it but I felt like I already saw several scenes because they are so close to what I read and imagined in the book. Definitely enjoying this CD set! I'm not one to use a lot of bonus features or other add-ons so my review is strictly focused on the main episodes."
5,One of the best new shows!,"One of the best new shows out there, and one of the best book-to-series adaptations I've seen since LOTR. There is lots of sex, nudity, violence, gore, etc, which I'm not usually a fan of, but in GoT, it makes the characters and their flaws and ambitions all the more real.The second season is even better than the first!"
4,Great deal on a very good box set.,"This was a great purchase at a great price. Too good of a deal to pass up.As a fan of George R. R. Martin's ""Game of Thrones"" book series, I basically think that the Blu-ray series is very entertaining and follows the storyline very well. However, there are lots of details in the books that haven't been included because of the length and complexity of the books. If you have read and enjoyed the books, more than likely you will enjoy the Blu-ray collection and be very satisfied with your purchase."
1,Warning-- Will Not Play in all Bluray Players,"I have a Sony Bluray player and the Season two Disc will not work ... I confirmed that my Firmware was updated and I had no problem with playing season one...It seems that the majority of seta are working based on reviews, but if you have a Sony bluray player model BDP you should be aware of this problem."
5,Great Fun to Watch,"Thoroughly enjoyed watching the Second Season of Game of Thrones. While all of the cast does fine work, Peter Dinklage as Tyrion is particularly outstanding. I'm not sure I would enjoy the series as much if I had not read all of the books in the series. The shows have a limited time to tell the many stories and I believe that having the background allows me to fill in the blanks and make the series that much better."
2,Great except for the playback glitches,"I had such high hopes for this edition - given the lush, visual goodness of the First Season on Blu-ray. This Season and the Blu-rays are indeed beautiful to behold. However, my review is mainly about the technical side of things. Buyer beware about pre-ordering the first edition on the production line. Although I am only on the 5th episode ... I am encountering glitches, freezes and skips in EVERY episode. Produced with the highest standards ...?!?! Sadly - not my copy. Hopefully, this isn't happening to to many other customers - it's a terrible shame to ruin such an incredible show."
1,Beware - Blu Ray Issues,"I would advise anyone considering purchasing this fine series to avoid the blu ray editions. Save yourself some money and a boatload of frustration by going with the dvd versions instead. The older blu ray software (powerdvd) on my home theater pc will not play these disks without purchasing an upgrade to the software which costs more than the disks themselves. This is extremely frustrating to say the least and has led me to conclude that these will be the last blu ray disks that I will ever purchase. Just as a point of information, there are hundreds of FREE Game of Thrones torrents floating around the internet. None of these copies are crippled with the drm that prevents me from watching my legally purchased version. Must I employ questionably legal actions to view the material that I legitimately obtained? Somehow, I feel like a victim of a scam."
5,I have not yet received this,"Love season one. I have not gotten season two yet, but I am looking forward to watching it. Love the cast and the story line."
1,No Digital Copy/ Great Show,Hate to do this bc the show is awesome but the digital copy insert is missing from the package. Seems a lot of people are having this problems and repeated emails to HBOdigital copy support have not been answered. Some people have had luck by emailing a pic of the front and back of their DVD case for proof of purchase but not me. I only bought it on bluray for the special features and the digital copy so I could watch something on plane trips (no reason to buy if you have HBO otherwise)...severely pissed off right now.
5,:D Great Series!,My husband and I loved this series. Full of action and suspense. Has you on the edge on your seat...
3,Oh dear.,"I do enjoy seeing my favorite characters come to live on TV but It is just a little too gory and a few too many scenes featuring naked women. In ‚ÄúGarden of Bones‚Äù I think a saw another set of boobs about ever 3-4 minutes, and can't say that I found them necessary. If I had not read the books and loved them I would not watch this series. I love the story but find the nudity a little overdone."
4,"Good follow up to first season, recommended buy!","For those lucky enough to not have read the book this season is 5 stars, for George R.R. Martin fans that have, however will most likely agree that it is a 4 star performance.Pros:Very noticeable increase in production budget, scenes are grander and the Dire wolves are done right!Several scenes not in the book add to the character depthWonderful immersive storySalidor San was casted perfectlyConsSome parts it deviates much from the book, Stanis' family, the faith of Davis, and the continues relationship of renley- all go away from the book which is a disappoi ntmentIt does feal a bit rushed as well fitting a 40+ hour book into a 10 hour season will cause thatSummaryBuy it, enjoy it, but if you have the option watch this before reading the book, then go buy the book!"
1,3 of the disks can't be played,"Only the first two disks are played well, the others are all having trouble reading. It says the format not supported."
5,Martin,"You just can't beat his storytelling in this series. Awesomeness!If you haven't seen this series before, begin with season one. You won't be disappointed."
3,packaging problems,"The blu-ray disks play fine so far, but the insert with the code for the digital copy is missing. I don't want to return the set, but I want what should be included.Also, there was no order summary with the shipment. There were 2 items in the order which arrived on time, but this is the first time there was no packing slip. Weird.That said, I love this series. Hate that HBO waits until the new episodes are about to start before they release the previous season on disk."
5,great show,"I know this will be excellent, have it ordered, now waiting on season 3 to start next year. great series"
5,Awesome,"Got this as a gift for Christmas, awesome series. I just ordered the second season, can't wait!Think I need to get HBO again!"
5,Very Smart,"I purchased Wordplay because I am always on the look out for games with an educational dimension. My son (aged 9) seems to have taken quite a liking to it, which is great since he tends to shy away from anything that he says `feels like school'. He loves the spinner in the middle of the game board (a nice touch), and the idea of `spinning to get your letters' (which are then used to form words). The words themselves are left to the child's imagination and vocabulary skills, ensuring that the game remains flexible and interesting. Even when he is not playing with some of his friends, my son sometimes comes up to me and asks that I spin for him (so that he can proudly show me the words he has formed using `my' letters). All in all, very smart. Sometimes the simplest ideas really are the best."
3,Fun game; cheap cheap make,"I played this game with my kids (under 8) and they seemed to like it: it is a spelling game and can be exciting for kids who have just mastered reading and writing. The participating adults can guide the game along, making it a cooperative game, rather than competitive.The down side--and it is a big down side--is that the game is so cheaply made that it is nearly impossible to play the game: The spin-wheel, which is key to the game as it determines which letter of the alphabet gets randomly selected, does NOT spin at all. I can't imagine this particular part, if made slightly better (say, barely usable), could have cost that much more--this game isn't cheap to begin with.Frankly, as much as my kids like this game, I feel that my money is not well spent."
5,Educational FUN!,"We got this game for our 6 year old, not knowing what to expect. Turns out that it really challenges her to come up with good words! After a few times, though, we didn't have to use the ""adult rules"" because (1) she was too good at it now, and (2) it was just as challanging for the adults as the children! Now, my 4 year old has joined in the game. We use a ""stripped down"" version of the rules for her: Now that she knows phonics, she came come up with a word that begins with one of the letters spun, and then writes down that word. Great practice for the whole family!"
1,Very Cheap,"I bought this as a gift for someone else and was embarrassed by how cheap it looked when we opened it. To top it off, the sand in the timer was all glued or stuck together so that the only element of the game which you couldn't make yourself didn't even work. The parts look like they're worth less than a $0.25 and the boards and pieces are ridiculously cheap. They could've at least put an extra nickel or two into the spinner, the key element of the game. As it is, I think a kindergartner could make this game in their arts and crafts hour. I'd recommend traditional word games like Scrabble or Boggle instead of this."
4,Great carrier!,"I got the 40"" for my 95 lb Rottweiler. He had plenty of room to lay down comfortably. It was great to be able to open the door from either side. The door was very easy to open/close."
3,Mind the Door!,"So, a carrier is a carrier is a carrier? This assembles easily, and can just as easily be disassembled for storage. Yay.I like that the door ""latch"" is operated from the top, and you can open from either the left or the right.However, the bottom of the door tends to close either under or over the plastic threshold, and care must be taken to ensure the door has latched securely through the bottom hole. If you are in a rush and might forget to double-check the door, maybe look for a more fool-proof carrier."
4,Happy Puppy,"My dog is an 8 month, 46lbs. Canaan Dog. He is growing so fast. I have used this travel kennel before, but in a much smaller size.I found it to be very sturdy and well build. I wanted my pal to have a clean, safe environment that would also give him plenty of space to stay when I can not be at home to let him roam free within my house......this Pet Kennel was the answer.Firstrax 40-Inch Pet Suites Multi-Use Pet Kennel"
2,Quality Control would be a GOOD thing!,"When they work... it's an awesome pet carrier! I have several and liked them so much that I wanted to get more. All it would take for this company to go from making a terrible product to a GREATone would be for someone to check that they function before shipping them out. I ordered two and could not operate the latches on BOTH of them. Amazon was great and sending them back for replacements was easy. Same problem with the replacements. This time I kept them hoping that the latching system would ""break in"" over time. Chances are equally good that they will just ""break"". I'm very disappointed. My old ones are great!"
4,Gets the job done,"This carrier is VERY easy to put together and a good size for a large cat. It does feel a little bit flimsy, compared to some other carriers I've owned, but worked well for moving our cat across the country with us."
4,A different Reagan,"Reagan as Governor of California was very different than Reagan as President. Probably because he was in more control then. This was the Reagan that admired Ayn Rand and put forward what was then a very pro-choice stand on abortion and signed some of the most progressive women's rights into law. At the same time he worked hard on fiscal conservatism and chopped a lot of waste.I find it interesting that a guy who never went to church would run for President like he was born-again (which of course he wasn't). I suppose you do what you must to win. Still, I liked the old Reagan best, which is why I really enjoyed this book."
5,Excellent overview,Lou Cannon is the recognized expert on the political career of Ronald Reagan and this is one of his best in a series of works on Reagan. An excellent overview.
2,Disappointed,"I was eagerly looking forward to reading this book by Lou Cannon, as I was under the impression that it deals solely with Reagan's term as Governor of California. Well, I guess I was wrong.The book discusses, in addition to his Governorship, his formative years in Illinois, his time in Hollywood, and the years that followed his Governorship from 1976-1980, subjects that have already been written about (by Lou Cannon and others) over and over again. I don't quite understand why these areas were included in this book.The section of the book that does deal with Reagan's Sacramento years are very informative. However, I do hope someone will come along and devote a book exclusively to Reagan's Sacramento years."
2,Could be better,"This doesn't inspire me the way it should. I want to see how Reagan became the greatest president that ever ruled the earth. There should be more details on how his way of thinking was formed, so that we can teach our children in the same way."
2,"Was good, but now....","This dresser seemed like a great investment when we bought it, however, after about 1 month of LIGHT use (we only use it for PJs, shorts, PTs, and underwear - all light things), the drawers have started breaking. At first we thought the first drawer was because of something that we did wrong, but now that 2 more drawers have broken, as well, one of which only had a couple of sleep pants and t-shirts in it, we know that there is no way we could have messed up building 3 separate drawers, with a 4th drawer beginning to fall into it's lower partner. I do not recommend buying this is you want it to last more than a month!"
4,Great for the money!,I probably looked at about a hundred dressers and went to about ten different stores. I was shocked and annoyed at how pricey composite freakin' wood could be! I wanted something that looked good and matched my other furniture but was under $150 and I found it. The key is assembly. I assembled it myself and it took almost a full day. If I had used some wood glue and a couple of extra nails this thing would be sturdy as all get out. Follow the directions carefully. The drawers slide in and out with quiet ease. The only negative thing I can say about the dresser is that it does chip easily but I've had it a few months without incident. Other than that it's fantastic.
4,Excellent watch..Great look.,I bought this watch very recently. Watch is having a gorgeous look. I guess the quality will be there since it is from Citizen. I bought this item for giving as a gift. Box of the watch does not look good since was having a shabby appearance. But over all I am happy for the price $55 with free shipping.I have given only 4 stars since the watch was bought a week before.
3,A little Drawn Out,Not a bad book but not great. A light chick lit read but it was a bit drawn out could have cut out a few of the chapters.
3,Ok Resource,This book is not outstanding but provides basic advice on the Performance Appraisal process. For $10 this is a decent resource for supervisors and managers to have in their library.
3,Crimper works fine,"The crimping action of this tool works fine, but the wire cutter/stripper is pretty iffy. You are better off to slice lightly around the jacket, removing about an inch and a half, and then lining up and flattening the necessary strands, and cutting to length (about 1/4"" for R11 and 1/2: for R45). Easier to work with that way, and less errors."
4,Good series,"Started reading this because it was made into a TV series and as usual the book is a lot better than the movie. He gets really wordy with names and the list of minor characters is immense. It got to the point where I could no longer remember one knight from another but that doesn't detract from the story. In fact I'm in awe as to how in the world he was able to keep all this stuff straight in his own mind.It's well worth reading and don't start it unless you want to get caught up in it. No sooner than you think everything is working out for some character they then fall deeper into something or they just get killed! Definitely a page turned and a grittier ""Lord of the Rings"" sort of book and not for the kids or young adults unless you want them to read four letter words and sexual situations."
2,Boring and stupid,"There are many twists and turns in this book. Unfortunately, it is done in a boring way. The twists are generally so ridiculous that I laughed, even though they are all supposed to be grim. It's a dark novel, but its so campy and silly that I just can't take it seriously or get into as much as other authors."
1,One of the Worst Books I've Ever Read,"This book took me an entire 3 months to read, just because it was so boring. War, war, death, burning, war, and more war, sums up this book. If you want to read this series.. I suggest skipping this book altogether, unless you enjoy extremely long accounts of war, more war, pain, mayhem, and endless, utterly long sequences of death. The other two books in the series so far are alright, but this book is worth skipping entirely. The whole book drags badly, and I had a hard time finishing it because I honestly disliked it so much, and so little was happening except for the above. George needs to learn how to seperate a fantasy from a made-up historical novel, with all the treacheries and evils and pain of true war.. and that's what this book reads like. NOT a pretty tale at all."
1,Well Done! But WHAT does it do?,"This writer really knows how to write! The book has all the elements of a good story, however, it is depressing to read. This reminds me of a good architect designing and building a fine structure as grand as the Stark's Winterfel, which people admire, but upon looking closer, the building blocks are made of compressed garbage. For all its fine design and craftsmanship, after awhile, it starts to stink. I would plead with the author to use his considerable talent to make something uplifting, maybe even inspiring. There are sources. In real life there are heroes who are good (not perfect), and smart and flexible and selfless. Love and sacrifice are as good for a story as lust and vengance!!!"
3,A Compelling Story From a Perverse Mind,"The author has an unbelievable ability to craft complex and believable characters. Moreover he can really make you hate the bad guys and love the good guys in this book, while making you worried about the fate of the good guys. There are even fascinating grey characters who are quite likeable, such as Tyrion. They are plenty of plot twists here, with major characters getting killed, changing the landscape of the story. The story appears to be building to some great climax that makes you want to read more.I would have given this book 5 stars, but I have one serious gripe. The author is perversely obsessed with sex. He feels compelled to describe various illicit sexual situations in many chapters in great detail, adding nothing of value to the story in my opinion. There is also unnecessary foul language. It's a shame because I'm still looking for good novels that I can allow my 10 year old son to read. This isn't one of them."
1,Buyer beware,"Not exactly a review of the product itself (it's a review of listing problems for this item), but I don't know where else to put a note like this.Just a heads up that this is not the only listing of the book and there have been some listings marked higher than those on the other Clash of Kings hardcover entries. Trying to see if Amazon will get rid of this listing since it's basically a dual listing that only allows buyers to purchase from individual sellers rather than through Amazon, for those trying to take advantage of the free shipping. If this entry is still coming up towards the top of the search, the other can be found by limiting the search criteria in the left for hardcover after you enter the title, or by using the ISBN."
2,Disappointing distractions,"Though I was transfixed by the previous book in the series, I did not make it through this one. Call me a prude, but the constant self-satisfying and obligatory sex in this book really distracted me and put me off. It seemed to me that the author had some kind of sex fetish and had to put as much of it in the book as he could. Simply put, his previous book in the series was tight. Though thick, nearly every scene and chapter moved the story. Not so with this book. Slowed by ""extra"" chapters detailing characters having sex, this book was not written for fantasy lovers, but for porn lovers. If you like to read such distraction, then buy the book, for the author's prose is both rich and lyrical. Too bad."
2,Book 2 goes back in time???,I am completely confused. I am reading Clash of Kings after finishing Game of Thrones. But most of the characters they are talking about have already died in book 1 or at least their experiences already happened in the first book. Clash of Kings does not continue the story from Game of Thrones but instead repeats things that I have already read. Am I psychic? Am I imagining this? I cannot find anyone else's comments that reflect this. Is this a glitch in the Kindle edition?
4,Good long read,It was good. Make sure you have lots of time to devote to it. Awesome series if you enjoy fantasy.
2,DISAPPOINTED WITH THE AUDIO VERSION RENDITION,Two disappointments: 1) No table of contents or indexing of what's on each of the 36 or so Audio CD's. What could be simpler than an accompanying single piece of paper with this information. 2) Disappointed with the narrated rendition. I am a BIG FAN of the King of Thrones Genre. The narration is bland at best. Too bad.
5,Game of Thrones- FABULOUS BOOK!,"Great story, with more to come, a must read. And especially if you are watching the show, you must read these, they leave and change so much in the shows. Very good reads the books have been!"
2,I won't buy any more of the series. Changed my mind.,"The original Game of Thrones was a great book. A good plot with lots of intrigue. For some reason the author must have thought if he added lots of filthy descriptive sex it would improve the book. It didn't. Also,the plot was so spread out it was a little hard to follow. If it wasn't for the gratuitous sex I might have bought more of the series. I'm not going to.The second half of this book was not so filthy as the first half. I did in fact buy the third in the series and will see how it goes. So far it has not been bad. Will review it when done."
5,Awesome,Once again these are some of the best ADULT fantasy books ever written. Just be warned if you are looking for orcs or goblins these are not the books for you.
5,Good fantasy with a complex plot.,"If you enjoy getting caught up in a book, go for this one. I also recommend something I just read that might be considered a modern fantasy series-- R. Doherty's AREA 51 books. Check them out. Lots of history and legend in a present day setting. Best thing I've read in a long time."
5,I demand that you read this!,"I was totally blown away by the scope of ""A Game of Thrones"" and likewise by ""A Clash of Kings."" Martin's work does not cover a very long period of time but the detail involved with Clash is amazing. I read this over the course of a week or two becuase I needed the time to digest just the amount of detail presented. I found Clash spellbinding and at the end of this 700+ page novel, I wanted more. You have to read this."
4,Almost as good as the first two...,"I have been thoroughly enjoying Martin's medieval/fantasy series. I especially enjoy that the series is about the story itself, not a particular character (otherwise it would be called 'A Song of Ned Stark' or 'A Song of Robb Stark'). Martin's willingness to kill off characters that have become beloved isn't a terrible thing at all. It keeps the story fresh as the reader wonders what will happen next. The only thing that awards this chapter 4 stars is that some of the plot is a little difficult to understand as a logical sequence of events (which was so great about about the first two instalments). I think these are probably petty concerns but it detracts just a little from the story. If you have read the previous instalments - buy this one. Don't stop or you'll never find out what happens... If you haven't read the first ones, go back and read them before you start on this one. It will make things a whole lot easier to follow."
5,Keeps the series interesting...,"So I'm not really sure how to review this on its own. I can't help but think of it as a continuation of Game of Thrones. It doesn't stop getting interesting, you've already grown attached to the characters and this part gets you even more into them.The ""weird"" thing is that you get some new characters and that might not be as fun as the other chapters, but that's just because you've grown closer to the other characters and know more about them by now.You can't stop after Game of Throne! You must keep up with this one... things are just starting to get massive!"
5,Can't Get Enough!,"I love this series! Just when I think I know what's going to happen, Martin completely surprises me! I initially became interested in the series after watching the show on HBO. But I was so confused by what was happening that I decided I needed to read the books. After reading the first 674-page paperback, I knew I had to get a Kindle for the remaining books in the series :) My favorite character is Arya and I'm eager to see where Martin takes her story. I definitely recommend this series to anyone who has the imagination to go with it!"
3,Clash of Kings,"A Clash of Kings (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 2)For fear of giving away too much, I'll be vague: The ending of the battle disappointed me. I came away feeling that the author gave up on a thread introduced early in the book ( the Red Priest and the Shadow Assasin). The book still kept me on my toes; must have read the book within three days. The characters, Jon Snow and Danny does not hold much interest for me however."
3,A mixed bag,"Well, I know I said after Game of Thrones that I would just settle for watching the series when it came out on DVD, but I guess my lack of patients got to me. I just finished the book and I feel that I worked pretty hard for a disappointing pay off. For a book that took me just over a month to read, not very much happened. When this book started out, Arya was on the run, John was deep in the wilderness, Sansa was being held by the Lannisters, Danearys had baby dragons and was trying to build an army, Joffrey was king and I hated his guts, and Tyrion was the hand. Now that I'm done, not much has changed. For me this series is a mixed bag. I'm sure that I will pick up the third book eventually, but for right now I want to get back to reading stuff I can read in about a week.Apparently the books only get longer from here. That's all I can say for now."
2,Yawn,"I enjoy the story,way too much time describing what each character is wearing and the ending stunk! Leaves you hanging so you have to buy the next one. I'm done with this author....."
2,A Really Slow Clash of Kings,"After reading ""A Game Of Thrones"" (this book's predecessor) I expected much more from ""A Clash of Kings"". The first book truly ""unfolded"" before my eyes, and introduced the world and its inhabitants to me in a very intriguing way.In contrast, I found this one slow and a bit confusing through most of the book. There was so much information about such a large number of characters that it was often hard to figure out who was doing what to whom and why. It was as though I was being force-fed character development information and background info in preparation for a test the next morning. Yikes!I will still read book 3 when it is released, in hopes that it is closer to the ""feel"" of the first book. If you are of the same mind, you'll want to trudge through this one so you don't miss part of the story.[Update, 2005] - I did read book 3, and have found it to be much better. Just thought I'd let everyone know that."
4,"""Paperback""","The internal was good, I have no complaints about the author.However,it would be nice if Amazon made were more distinction for an 8x11 TRADE paperback from a regular (What are they calling it now, ""Mass Market""?) Paperback.Just know you're getting a hardback-sized purchase with this particular link. I clicked too soon, and I regret it."
3,Clash of Kings,"I read all of the books, but the reason I rated this lower is because it is hard to wade through all of the characters and incidental details. If those were left out it would be a 2-3 very interesting book series, instead of the 5."
5,Awesome,I really enjoyed this book. I really enjoyed this installment but it has left me hanging - so I can't wait to get started on the next one!
5,really enjoyed,loved the way you explore the different charaters. thouroughly enjoyed. i did not want to put it down. didn't have enough time in the day to keep reading.
5,Second in quality only to the prequel,"George R.R. Martin has done it again, and with style, I might add. His innovative writing that was displayed in ""A Game Of Thrones"" makes a triumphant return. Two new characters' viewpoints are added to compensate for the loss of one in the first book, both of which are insightful and fun to read. I am astounded by the way that the author can empathize so accurately with NINE different characters, all which build off each other to convey the hugely addictive storyline. I found it impossible not to care about the characters--the witty Tyrion, the grim Davos, the arrogant Theon, the saddened Catelyn...I love them all. My only complaint is that magic is used more than in the first book, which slightly detracts from the gritty realism. Nothing to sneeze over, though. This is a great book written by a brilliant author. Do yourself a favor and add this one to your collection."
4,REALLY REMARKABLE,aS YOU SEE BY NAME i DONT NORMALLY READ FANTASY BUT MY OLDER BROTHER IS AN AVID READER OF SEVERAL AUTHORS. i HAVE READ ONLY TWO SERIES BEFORE THIS ONE (JENNIFER ROBERSON IN THE EARLY 80'S AND OF COARSE WOT - ROBERT JORDAN)BUT I HAVE TO SAY SO FAR THESE TWO BOOKS HAVE KEPT ME WANTING MORE AT THE END. WHERE AS I CAN NORMALLY PUT A BOOK DOWN AND GET ON WITH MY DAY NOT SO WITH A CLASH OF KINGS SO THOSE THAT HAVE FOUND THIS BOOK BORING GET AN IMAGINATION!!! GEORGE KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK AND GIVE US #3 REALLY SOON.
1,What a shame!,The marketing people released this without ever listening to it. The prologue sounds more like a tedious prayer recited at church than a rousing good tale that grips you and doesn't let you go. God awful performance and it just may be the director's fault. If only someone had thought to read with feeling rather than recite an epic. Too bad! Maybe they'll release a version that the book deserves. This one is for the dustbin.
2,Boring,I skiped pages and pages. The description of every single thing was tiresome. I passed page after page without reading them looking for a quotation mark to see where the dialog followed.Borring.
3,"love the series, hate the price","I love the series, but I can't believe these books are 8.99 when most of the Kindle ebooks I buy are between 4 and 6 bucks."
3,A little long and dry but good.,Pretty good but not as good as the first. Some of the characters got a little boring. Can hardly wait to get it on DVD though.
5,Clash of Kings,"Good read. Very interesting. Characters grow as the plot evolves. Though lengthy at times, it flies nicely. Recommended for readung"
5,Must read,"as usual good book he keeps you wanting more - as the first and the 3rd and so on, this is the first time I've read George Martin - look forward to his other books"
4,Awesome Book,"I have been watching the series on HBO and was really interested in reading the books. I couldn't have expected anything better, a must read."
3,More interesting but still the problems still persist,There is the inherent problem in epics. They never focus much on all of the cast and introduce new characters. Still a interesting cast and story but the pacing is terrible.
4,A Clash of Kings,"Like the first two books of the series,along with the third one, but the next two aren't as good. Taking a long time to read through a Dance with Dragons. Wish they were all good as A Clash of Kings"
4,Connie D,"I loved the first book in this series (Book of Thrones:A Song of Ice and Fire), however the second book, A Clash of Kings, is more war oriented and I personally wasn't as thrilled with it. If you like war you may like it. Still good but sometimes monotonous."
3,Can't care about a character because they will die,I just finished reading this book (really audio book don't think I would have stamina to read this type of novel). Got 3/4 and had to go to to wikipedia to see what happened because it was just too slow. This reads more like daily fantasy soap than a novel. Too much killing and raping not enough movement of the story. I will wait to see this on HBO maybe it will make me interested again to read 1000 pages for the next 5 novels.
1,ZZZZzzzzzzz.....,"I barely made it through book one of this series... I got book 2 because I hate to leave a story unfinished, but this one is sooo boring I just couldn't stand it anymore. I just couldn't manage to care about any of these characters..."
3,Too many characters!!!,"I LOVE Game of Thrones and plan on watching the whole series, but the second book is just too tedious and bogged down with characters. I quit around page 150 after reading a paragraph that contained no less than 5 name drops of characters I either couldn't remember or didn't know yet. GRRM is such a great storyteller. Just wish I could read him without using a flow chart."
3,Beter than the usual fare,"I read the entire series. Well written but tedious,overlong descriptions. I skimmed much of the series looking for action and plot. It kept my interest enough to slog through all five books hoping for a satisfying conclusion. It finally ended in a shaggy dog ending. The final epilog was no different from any previous chapter. I was very disappointed, romantic that I am; I wanted a happy ending. No such luck. It seemed that another book was waiting to be published to finish thing off. I kept feeling that with good research, the books could have been redeeming by being actual historical fiction."
2,Depressing,"First let me start off with the fact that the book is well written. There are a couple unfortunate problems. One the author slows down the book for pages and pages of dialoge. Second and more important his books are just too depresing. People get raped it happens I get it. I am okay with a little bit of it in the book, but this author seems to believe that every twenty pages of the book someone has to be raped, and the other twenty someone is having sex with their brother. Then there is the fact that Martin seems to think that no one can be faithful to their wives. I understand some are not but that is not a universal constant there are people out there who are loyal to their wives or husbands their whole life. Finally every character seems to be a bickering, petty child. People may not be simply good or evil but not all people have a desire to conquer kill and rape like 95% of these characters did."
5,Buy This Book Immediately!,"I am a fantasy series burnout. I read Jordan's 'Wheel of Time' as far as the first 5 books - looking back I wish he would have stopped writing after that 2nd one....So it was something of a joke when, on the recommendation of a friend, I picked up George R.R. Martin's 'doorstop' fantasy series. The big suprise is that these books are tremendously fun to read with great plots and characters. No plastic here, just great stories.I can't wait for the next book...."
4,Excellent Author desperately in need of Prozac,"Mr.Martin is a superb storyteller. He pays great attention to detail and references his past works diligently. My main problem is these books are so depressing. After 8000 years of this civilisations' existence,(8000 years of the Stark name being extant), the people in this story have barely gotten past inventing the wheel. Imagine being stuck in a cold murky castle, with a feudal system of crazed knights, lords and kings for eternity - this is the definition of a nightmare. Does the story line get less depressing with this book? Heck no, it's worse. Maybe after ten 1000 page books, these folks will discover the steam engine. I don't consider this series fantasy - it is pure horror. I will read the next installment in the series, if only to find out how much mileage martin can get out of this well thought out nightmare."
4,A relief in most ways,"Of all the things that annoy me in books and movies, probably the one problem that grates on me the most is the fact that main characters never die and that all the evil characters have no motive or real train of thought beyond 'Be evil'. Whereas the good characters will be painfully good. A Clash of Kings was a welcome breath of relief. Main characters die and there were no truly good characters. Most the time I didn't know who to root for though I knew who I wanted dead (Joffrey and Joffrey again).About the sex and violence: Violence I've never minded unless it's exaggerated, unrealistic or pointless. The sex isn't needed but those parts are generally short and can easily be skipped over.This book went somewhere, at least one king and maybe two are disposed of in its pages and I see an end for it closer than the Wheel of Time at least."
3,Its a great book just.....,Its hard to remember who anybody is though. Because the story jumps back and forth to much ....give a few more pages to the characters. Not just the normal 40 or 50 that you have been giving
1,Roy Dotrice does not do the book justice.,"Every character sounds the game, and they all sound like they're straight out of Treasure Island. I wish for another audiobook option, as the terrible voicework absolutely ruins it."
3,Details and Description Galore,"I just finished this book, the second in the series and I am taking a break to read something lighter before I go on to the third. I have not seen the HBO series and some friends have told me to watch them before I continue. Although Book 1 and 2 are very well written sometimes the details seem to get in the way of the story. I discussed this with others that have read the books and they agree. Some have even given up."
5,"Happily Ever After? Well, no.","The bloodthirsty carnage continues. Most sequels have some kind of let down. Don't believe it here. George R R Martin's second volume of ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" is just as loaded with strangeness as the first one was, and that means bad things are going to happen to lots of people.Not only will you not put it down, when you're done, you'll go buy the third book. This makes my top ten for the past ten years, and books one and three of the series (A Game of Thrones, and A Storm of Swords) are right there with it.Buy them, read them, and be chomping at the bit for the next book to arrive."
5,Thrilling!!!!!,"I was just dying for the sequel the moment i finished a Game of Thrones. I didn't know this would be even better!!! it is extremely well written and i was never bored for a second. It's hard to stand the suspense between chapters!! it's high paced, exiting action. the characters and setting are developed so well it's hard to beleive it's fantasy. the plot is nearly perfect; everything fits together and moves so fluently.i haven't read many fantasy books, but this is definitely the best of them all."
3,Not as good as the first,"To preface, I absolutely loved the first book. This one dragged out too much. I would nuke about 300 pages off of it, which would make it flow like the first one did. There are a lot of characters to follow, and I found myself losing interest in some of the lesser important ones. Even the important ones had chapter after chapter written about them which did not advance the story noticeably.I will keep reading this series, I'd rate this book at 'worthwhile read'. I am hoping (likely in vain) that the author will get back to making every chapter count and getting me to really turn pages."
4,A Clash of Kings: A Song of Ice and Fire,Because it is very enthralling....main characters getting killed when you don't expect it.....hating to put it down.....and can't wait to get back to it.
5,great book,the book offers much more insight into the Westeros world than TV series. few lines (esp. Tyrion's) are quite hilarious
5,Amazing,"This book is great. The writing is tight, characters are believable, and the drama -- although omnipresent -- is gripping.Having read all five books, the only caution I have is that the series drops in quality. It may get better in later books (i.e., after Book Five), but right now, the decline has been steady though not uniform: the first three books are all pretty great, while the fourth is confused/confusing, while the fifth is almost hard to read."
2,just couldn't do it...,i know these books are really popular and i did get through the first one: by the end it was finally getting exciting! with the second i felt i was plunged back into this boring diatribe about who was son of so and so and cousin to such and such and who was heir to blah and blah. i really like the characters but the writing is so heavy handed i think i'll just watch the mini series.
4,Very good,"well written and excellent book it is deffinetly some thing new to the read, i give it a thumbs up."
4,Another Winner,"A Clash of Kings was equally as intriguing and fun to read as A Game of Thrones. If you liked the first book in the series, you'll like this one as well. It starts off a bit slow with even more names and places to learn, but quickly picks up speed in a race to the end."
4,A Clash of Kings,This is a great book if you enjoy fantasy novels. It is rich in detail and story lines. I had to read the whole series so I could get to the end. It was money well spent.
4,Book 2 Review,Better than book 1 and much better than the HBO series and the HBO series is fantastic. Can't wait to read book 3.
4,"Great book, but a slower Follow up to the first book","This book was well written, but was very slow at times and wasn't as action packed or had the twists in plot and mystery as the initial book in this series. Overall a good read, but I'm ready to go to the next book, ""A Storm of Swords"""
1,poor print copy format,"unreadable book format.. text too small, pages too small, book size too deep, awkward.. had to download ebook... what a shocker!"
2,depressing,"I found this one even more depressing than book one. I have always said a good book will never let you down, this one is and did. I also read the authors interview, and did not care for his attitude toward his readers. I would recommend this book only to masochists."
2,Poor character development - boring!!!,"It's really hard to relate to his characters. You only get about 8 - 10 pages at a clip, and wait over 100 pages until you get back to them. Really crowded!!! Too many characters, and most are under the age of 13. G. R. R. shows his lack of connection to this age group (and female characters especially) by making most of them wooden - you really start hoping that they die soon just to get them out of the way of the more interesting figures - like the dwarf. I won't be reading the next installment..."
1,Skipping CD's,"I am a big fan of the whole series of ""A Song Of Ice And Fire. The author is fantastic and the reader is great. I am so angry that CD""s 26,27, and 28 skip HORRIBLY! I am not even finished so I don't know how bad the rest of the collection is. RUINING a great book. The CD's are brand new with no visible marks or scratches. I have to purchase the book to find out what I missed. NOT GOOD!"
2,He's clearly losing his touch,"The first few books were brilliant, but this one compared to those seems lackluster and lazy. For something that ultimately is this ""late"" beyond its original promised date (by the author) I was saddened to see him re-using the same plot elements over and over so frequently that plausibility shoots right out the window."
4,Like but not love,"Like many others I loved the first novel but I feel this one falls short. I still enjoy the read but I skim much of the, what I think, is unecessary descriptive and long winded text. I still love the characters and the plot and look forward to picking it up every night."
3,Book,Since most of the main characters have been killed off or wounded so badly that they probably won't survive long. It almost seems that the author is on a schedule and lacks the skill he showed in the prior books.
4,Gripping characters that keep you interested until the end!,"Although the plot hasn't changed much and no new significantcharacters have been introduced Martin still Manages to keep thereader interested until the last page. Some of the flare has been lost from a ""Game of Thrones"" and more fantasy has been introduced, Martin still kept me going and dying to read the next one."
5,A Clash of Kings,"I am currently reading the book, almost finished, enjoying it very much. I read the first in the series after watching the HBO show. I bought all the books in the series and will be looking for more of George R.R. Martins books."
5,Incredibly Developed Characters and Storylines,"George R.R. Martin has taken a fundamental fantasy plot-style and made it his own. His characters come to life and keep you glued to the pages waiting to see what happens to them. I have read thousands of science fiction and fantasy books - this series is definitely up there on my list of favorites. If you enjoy getting your monies worth from large volumes of excitement, this series is a must add to your list to read."
4,Sweeping story,"This is a must read after the first novel. Again, the story is almost too big to keep up with. There are all kinds of interlinking stories. Very fast paced."
4,A Clash of Kings: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Two,"This is a marvelous continuation of Martin's Throne Game series. The complex and engaging story line features interwoven tales of intrigue, lust for power, political dynamics and ambition. The characters are rich and wonderfully constructed. I am reminded of Tolkein but perhaps that is unfair to both Martin and Tolkein. I'm thoroughly enjoying the literary journey."
5,"Compelling, I was beyond the Wall.","Just like A GAME OF THRONES, this installment of A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE gripped me from start to finish. The twists and turns, the suspense, the absolute disbelief I would experience as my favourite characters were plunged further and further into seemingly inescapable choas. Fantastic! Mr. Martin, please write quickly, very quickly. Volume 3 cannot come soon enough. Long live Bran!"
3,Little disappointing.,"While I like the story line and the main characters, book 2 had too much graphic violence and sexual content. I found myself skipping over many pages to get past stuff i did not want to read and that had little to do with the plot. I have decided that I will not read the other books even though I was fascinated by the plot and the protagonists because I am not interested enough to wade through that kind of junk."
4,Even better than the HBO series,"The second volume in the series moves a little slower than the first, and has fewer scenes with big emotional impact. I love all the books but this one is tied with A Dance with Dragons for 3rd best. There is a lot of great stuff in this book that is done better than the HBO series, particularly Jon Snow and Arya. There are a few scenes that were also hard to translate into television, for instance some of Dany's POV regarding prophesies.Don't miss out, read this book even if you have seen the show."
5,Brilliant Book 2!,"After watching the Game of Thrones series on HBO I was immediately hooked on the storyline and the characters! I wanted more. I never really have extra time to sit and read but I made time for the next book and it was SO worth it! I do get a bit confused with all the different Ser's and Lord's after a while, but Mr. Martin is very helpful with his maps and charts at the end of the book to help with the confusion. I couldn't put the book down and am starting book 3 today. I enjoy that after watching the HBO series I can put names with the actor's playing these characters. It makes the story even more exciting. I hope that the tv series keeps taking off like it has and we will be able to watch all five books come to life."
3,"An okay read, but not great.","Martin does a fair job of interweaving a complex plot, but I wasn't totally drawn into his world. There are too many characters and not enough character development. I also felt the book was too long--there are long stretches where very little is going on."
3,Here things start to fracture.,"Mr. Martin starts to digress as he spends more and more time with more and more characters. The shifts in Points-of-View become tiresome. The story fractures as its focus shifts away from the Starks, the protagonists of his first novel. A good read, but really several stories rather than one coherent story."
3,Who dies next?,"The first book introduced a very detailed world and the rather ""earthy"" tone of the writing was refreshing. My question is whether this is really simply a narrative of some role-playing group's campaign? It seems that the author by some random means--perhaps dice?--decides every hundred or so pages to kill of what one thought to be a main character.Also, for the amount of pages you would hope there would actually be more movement in the story rather than introducing yet another mildly interesting character for no apparent reason.I truly hope that Martin hasn't bought into the Jordanesque ""let's see how much I can milk this for"" style of writing. It would be a shame, because the story line shows some very good flashes."
2,2 1/2 years between books--is the fault the publisher's?,"I guess no. Most publishers would not want more than a year to lapse between hardcover publication of a [potential] best-selling series. After reading this book, my guess is that George went through a difficult period in his life that delayed his writing this book AND changed its ""ambience"": this book is nasty, brutish, and crude--I will probably not finish this series. Accomplished craftsman that he is, the book works, but not with the 'feel' of Volume 1. I have no worries about George as a writer, but if my guess is correct, (I) hope he works through his personal problems."
1,Too long,Martin needs to take a lesson from Tolkien and learn how to write a book that is manageable to read. I quit reading this about 800 pages in when I realized there was still over 500 pages to read.
3,"Interesting story, annoying storytelling","Nicely plotted with a plethora of well drawn characters, but his commitment to equal opportunity POV storytelling makes this a tedious read. So many cliffhangers involving the busy characters followed by multiple chapters of ennui from characters essentially doing nothing. The sword is at the Kingslayer's throat! But first let's spend another 40 pages with Daenerys waiting for her baby dragons to grow up! I'm sure I'm not the only reader who would have been glad to just spend the whole book with sly, witty, basically humane Tyrion."
3,A Clash of KIngs,"While there is much to like about this book, there is one HUGE problem: it's FAR TOO LONG, and unnecessarily so. Arent there any editors at Bantam Books? If so, they should meet Eddard Stark's fate for unleashing this monstrously overlong tome on the reading public. Due to all the excessive verbiage, the story really DRAAAAAGS at times. Indeed, there are WHOLE chapters that could be cut without losing even the most nuanced parts of the tale. While the story is interesting and the characters compelling, the pacing is awful and the plot frequently drifts aimlessly. The paperback version is 969 pages. At about HALF that length, this book would be a much more enjoyable read!"
3,"beautiful in parts, lags as a whole","Let me first say that I enjoy this series and am looking forward to reading A Storm of Swords. I rate Clash of Kings at 3 stars, because I must unfortunately compare it with its predecessor, Game of Throne-- which was far more focused. I have to admit I am also missing the absence of a particular character I came to admire very greatly in the first novel. Clash of Kings wanders in the first half and offers at least one unnecessary point of view (Theon). By the second half, Martin brings it back into focus, with Tyrion and Catelyn serving as the binding forces of the novel. The inclusion of Melisandre seems somewhat forced and is treated often like an afterthough, though I do like how magic is gradually slipping back into the fabric of these people's lives. I will continue reading the series, especially as I am anticipating the next volume to be a vast improvement over this one and hopefully more reminiscent of Game of Thrones."
2,Leave this author for 10 years,"I can't give Martin an A or F for his effort- I grade him incomplete. This is another grand epic, well written, but released by the cup full when only the bucket is compelling. I am making the same pledge after Clash of Thrones as I did after reading Jordan's Path of Daggers. There are so many primary characters and they all have separate story threads, so that now instead of one story you have nine stories, which means that none of characters get resolution over the course of a 400 page book, because they are only in it for 40 or 50 pages. This wouldn't be a problem if the whole story was there on the shelf, then- I would only need to decide whether to invest all my liesure time for the next 6 months reading it- but when you get it in dribbles, it is hard to remember who any of the characters are, what trouble they are in and what they planned to do about it. I am putting this author away until his story is no longer a work in process."
2,What a disapointment,"Well, A Game of Thrones was a great book. The characters were the most incredible people I've ever read, and the plot line went along amazingly smoothly, considering that there were many different people and the point of view changed from chapter to chapter.Unfortuatly, all is not well in paradise.A Clash of Kings book is heavy, boring, and cumbersome. While I could stand the sex scenes in A Game of Thrones, they became beyond disgusting in this installment, making me wonder if the author wrote them for his own personal enjoyment. The characters were excellent, but the plot line confusing; more than once did I wonder what on earth was going on.Not the greatest, but I'm sure not the worst. Let's hope that the next book is better."
2,ebook sucks,its kindle version has vertical margins between paragraphs and its page information is broken. it says the book is 41 pages long.
2,A downward spiral.,"I read this book while under the impression that it was the second part of a trilogy. In trilogies, it's customary for the second book to be rather dark (so that the heroes can win against all odds in the end of book three). Because of this I wasn't surprised when ""A Clash of Kings"" described a bloody civil war, the torture of innocent villagers, murder, dark forces closing in, and so on.Still, too little happens that actually develops the plot. Mostly, it gets more and more comlicated. Characters die, but many more are added. I read on, thinking that the first book in the series, ""A Game of Thrones"", was much better, and that part three would probably be better than this too.In short, I had a feeling I was watching Martin's world slowly come apart. I hoped he knew what he was doing, but even so, I didn't find this book very enjoyable but quite a disappointment."
1,Tedious,"I liked Book 1 of ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" a lot . This one was just tedious, with Ser this and Ser that. It lacked the human interest of the first one. This is reflected in the HBO series - Season 1 was much better than Season 2. However I was able to watch all of Season 2 but was unable to finish the book and put it down about two thirds of the way through."
5,Would reccomend,"These books are great, especially on the kindle. They were so easy to read I could not put them down."
5,The next great fantasy series.,"I am the worlds number one fantasy fan . I am 16 and I have read nearly every series in the genre( and I mean it). I have been a faithful jordanite(wot)for 6 years but in this book I have found a new champion. A Game of Thrones is truly one of the greatest fantasy novels ever. Martin has a masterpeice here . The story line is mysterious and magical as well as unpredictable. The characters seem to live and breath . Martin has definitely shot to the top of the genre . And hopefully the rest of the series will push him to the peak. I am telling you, you have to read this book!"
3,Didn't live up to book One,I just didn't seem to become as fully invested in the new characters of book 2. I was still caring about the original cast. Perhaps they were better developed and either more colorful or sympathetic. In addition the lengthy battle scenes were repetitious and I found myself all to often skimming to get on with the plot.Have not yet moved on to book 3 but would consider giving it a try when my reading list has dwindled.
4,overall great but too much torture & horror,"These books really are a cut above the usual, and I'm glad I read them, but I won't be going on to book 3. I appreciate the realism and it makes a refreshing change, but there is a bit too much sadistic torture/horror for me to stomach. To give Martin his due, he is the only fantasy author I know who tells the truth: shallow people prattle about how suffering ennobles the soul, but in fact cruelty disfigures the soul, as much as it does the body. People who are brutalized often become brutes. But I just don't want to watch as Arya becomes more and more twisted and vengeful."
5,Game of Thrones,Game of Thrones is captivating and keeps you totally engrossed. Hard to put the book down. A must read for the whole series.
4,season two/book two Game of Thrones,"enjoyable reading, if you like Game of Thrones,you need to read the books for details. This is adult fantasy/adventure."
4,Hubba Hubba,"I have enjoyed this series immensely, and am desperately awaiting the coming of the paperback 5th book. I was introduced by a Grandson at Christmas, who gave me the first book of this series. It is a little hard to keep juggling all the characters in your head while waiting him to tell us more of what is happening in their life, but I like it more than if he was trying to keep them all together and comment on their activities. It would be so confusing, somewhat like real life....Kuudos.Walt Ray"
4,"Slow at first, worth the wait","I loved the first book and read it fairly quickly considering the 850+ page length. I couldn't wait to get to book two. However, the first few hundred pages (40% or so on Kindle), I felt that the story was dragging. I found myself seriously considering not continuing with the book. Then, all at once, things started to happen. I was glad I ""plugged through"" and ended up enjoying the book. One thing is for sure - there are surprises and unexpected happenings left and right in this book. Thankfully, I am now looking forward to book three."
5,I LOVED IT.,This book is amazing! I couldn't put it down when i started reading. Such great characters and fantastic story telling. I am so pleased that i am ordering the rest. I am currently reading book 3. Amazing books.
3,Okay,His approach becomes less and less unique as the series goes on. It is somewhat entertaining. However the series is growing tiresome.
5,GRRM - What can I say that has not already been said?,"How can someone like me, review someone like George R.R. Martin. I am soooo not qualified.I bow to the master andI patiently . .patiently . . .patiently . . . .await THE WINDS OF WINTER."
2,"Good writing, suck story","How can a book keep me entertained enough to finish, while simultaneously making me hate the story that is being told? Ask George Martin. The characters never quite get there. As soon as I begin to enjoy them, they're gone. I should have been warned by the series title that the real story is about the futility of politics (duh) and not wasted my time, but, alas, I'm an idiot in search of a good story to read."
4,Go Forth and Conquer,For me it always starts with prose and as seems to be the trend with Martin's it is easy to follow and really just a pleasure to read.Other than that I find it hard to write about books in a series. Should you keep going? YES!This one moves at about the same pace as the first one with a bit slower of a finish. Even the big stuff doesn't feel all that grandiose (but this isn't a bad thing).There is one thing that happens in this book where I had to breathe a sigh of relief when the events didn't actually come to pass.Really the major point here is keep going because I sure am.
4,twists & turns,I throughly enjoyed the crooked paths of the many characters Mr. Martin devolped. Each chapter left me wanting to read just a little more.
2,did not finish. would be very good is good keep swearing out,martin is a very entertaining writer but i was disappointed at the vulgarity that was totally unneccesary. any reference to sex has to have the 'f' word. i hear enough garbage each day and find it refreshing when a writer can communicate without swearing. many books contain a lot more bad language than this book but it turned me off. george you lost a reader for what it is worth. so long for this book and any you write.
3,"Good, but choppy","I enjoyed both of Mr. Martin's books, but both suffer from what I call choppiness. If you try to read the book the way it is written, it becomes way too cumbersome as you switch from character to character trying to let each develop while letting the plot progress. If someone with influence with Mr. Martin reads this, please ask him to put 2 to 3 of each character's chapters together. I believe doing this will promote greater character development, lessen the cognitive load created by trying to read a book from cover to cover in a relatively short period of time (he is pretty good you know), and not impede the flow of the plot. If book three remains the same, well, I guess I'll do what I did with the first two -- skip from character to character saving a few chapters at the end for last."
2,Clash of Kings,"A bit too graphic for my taste. A lot of blood and a lot of sex. Will suit others, just not me."
4,Game of thrones book 2,Another triumph from the man himself. This book is everything the first one is and more. More characters have been added which gives the story more depth. I can't put this one down. Great stuff!
2,Boring!!,"Currently almost halfway through the book. It is almost nothing but a series of conversations and exposition. Does anything exciting ever happen, at least a litte bit in the second half?"
2,Too descriptive. Waste of timee.,inconsequential details that only make the book harder to read. Boredom is setting in quickly. I have read the first four and becoming more disappointed.
5,Great sequel,This arrived new and in a timely fashion. It is also a great sequel to A Game of Thrones. Enjoy.
4,An epic segue...,"A Clash of Kings continues Martin's epic. A great read and epic segue into book three, A Storm of Swords."
4,Kings,This book was in excellent shape and a joy to read...i appreciate the quickness with which it was shipped
4,A wonderful world to lose yourself in.,"I don't normally read fantasy epics, but I've been a fan of Martin's since I first read Fevre Dream, the ultimate 19th century vampire novel. This series has it all. Memorable characters. A wide range of venues and adventures. Twists, turns and wolves. Winter is coming. And so are the dragons. Sign on now, read up, and get ready for the final two installments. Anything might happen. And, knowing Martin, it will."
5,"""Outstanding; Awesome; Far and Away One of the Best....""","Martin has taken Fantasy to the next level. I can not recommend this book enough. For anyone who reads Fantasy & Sci-Fi: Get this book you won't regret it. Martin, weaves together the most captivating tale I have ever read; Characters that you care for, plot twists that keep you jumping and a style that keeps you turning the pages. Martin is truly one of the ""Best""."
5,Song of Ice & fire series,"Loved this whole series, am disappointed we will have to wait so long for the next book to come out, will need a lot of chapters bringing up to date, or will need to re read the whole series again. It was such a surprise when main characters are killed off, sending your thoughts on to a new direction. I read the whole series on kindle, I think I would have found the books with the small print and large size a bit daunting. The story line challenged my imagination and for a time I could enter another world."
4,"Eh, pretty good","This is certainly a well made book, the characters and the action are great. It all moves together quickly, never having the characters rest in one castle for too long. Thankfully it has expelled some of the brain damage caused by the Wheel of Time series (Jordan is a money grubbing banjo-hitter.) The problems; sometimes you want the Lannisters(generally more bad than good) to win, or you want the Starks (more good than bad) to win. ... Winter is coming."
4,Great read,"A great continuation from the first book, just as entertaining and intriguing, very glad I read it. Haven't kept up to date with the TV series, but now am very keen to go back and watch it, especially with the additional details I know from reading this book."
4,A Clash of Kings: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Two,I'm about half way through and this book is as good as the first. Best part about it is not having to remember all the characters since they are the same as the first.
3,Didn't Enjoy,"The writing is excellent, but if you become attached to the characters the contuining strife and pain the characters face can become overwhelming."
2,Mantasy,"I read the first novel in this series at the urging of a friend. It was ok, a bit violent for my tastes. I did like the plot twists and style, so I started reading this. The plot twists and style were still there, but I could not finish it. Frankly, the wanton and gleeful depictions of rape and violence were too much for me. I found it deeply disturbing, enough that I felt nauseated.I guess it may be different if you are a man; I have yet to meet a woman who actually liked this book. My male friends speak enthusiastically about this series. Ugh. Even thinking about it now is making me queasy."
2,The second book lets down.,The book was a weak follow up to a very promising first book. It can be summed up as much ado about nothing.
2,A good story but tarnished...,"The plot to this story is immense, with many different facets. However, at every turn in the book the author would perform extreme violence or debase women in such a way that seemed to go beyond the context of the story. Perhaps the author wished to show the violent nature of people or portray a character as evil, but the nature of acts committed to women, from graphic rape to extreme violence instead brought me out of the book and made me angry at the author, not at the character committing the acts. Other talented authors have conveyed character motives and attributes in different ways, unfortunately this author did not. I will not be purchasing any future works from this author."
5,The depth of the characters.,When reading this book it evolved the story line from book one but also the real personalities began to emerge. Left me wanting more immediately.
5,Absolutely Enthralling,We have been watching Game of Thrones without realizing that they were based on a book series. The books fill in the characters so much. It is exciting reading.
3,Depressing as hell,"I am enjoying this book, as I enjoyed A Game of Thrones. However, it's mercilessly sad. People die, and get killed, and die, and rape each other. What's the point of a book without hope?Nonetheless, the action scenes are riveting, and Martin holds our attention with the ominous foreboding of the Haunted Forest and the continued adventures of our Winterfell protagonists.If you are a big medieval and action fan, you will like this, but it is depressing."
5,Best Book Ever,"ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ, AND I HAVE BEEN AN AVID FAN OF F @ SIFI FOR OVER 8 YEARS READING ON AVERAGE A BOOK EVRY WEEK/TWO WEEKS."
5,Absolutley amazing!,"I am a fairly diehard fantasy fan, having been weaned on hardcore scifi as a child. Up until now I was rating Robert Jordan at the top of my favorite authors list. Well sorry RJ but George Martin just bumped you a notch. The author does an excellent job a fleshing out the characters with a minimum of words (unlike RJ). I am torn now knowing that characters I have come to respect and know are destined to be enemies, and Mr. Martin has the nasty little trick of developing really great characters and then killing them! All I can say is that I am anxiously waiting the next book and my only solace is that RJ's Path of Daggers is due out next month."
5,"Awesome, amazing, astounding","This is the best sword and sorcery I have EVER read. Wonderful characters, compelling world.My only quibble is this book is NOT for kids. It has graphic, sadistic sex and children in very dangerous situations.But as an adult read.... fantastic."
5,addictive,I can't put it down! It's so intense!! Definitely one of my favorite series and I am only on book 2!
2,Slow Motion,"I stopped reading this armor-porn on book 2. This story moves so slowly, it seems that Martin is betting the income for his entire life on this series. And do I have to have a 2 page, inch by inch description of every suit of armor and every change of armor in the series? And if it's to be so slow, why is so much happening remotely and told second hand?I love fantasy and sword and sorcery, but this moved at a glacial pace. The only thing I will miss is the story of the knights on the wall. I skipped through half this volume to read their tale."
2,Not worth It,"I don't want to give away any spoilers out of respect to tnose who will still buy this book. Accordingly, i will be brief. My problem with these two books is that there are few likable characters. The few that are charidmatic or heroic are killed and you and up reading hundreds and hundreds of pages about characters that you simply dont like. Eventually, despite the undeniably remarkable imagination of the author in creating this universe, it all feels like a waste of time."
5,Real-istic fantasy. Martin is the Heir of the Kingdom!,"Of all the fantasy series I read in the last years this is the most exciting and thrilling one. A real masterpiece for the genre: epic, honor, violence, human feelings, lust and evil mixed up. A brand new interpretation of classic fantasy style, a sort of new writing philosophy of genre. Martin is the Heir of the Kingdom after Tolkien, Eddings, Williams, Jordan and Goodkind. Can't wait too long for the next book."
2,Test Your Endurance! Can you continue to care?!,"Oh, gods... I'm not sure how Martin has bagged such critical acclaim with these books. His stories progress at a glacial pace. This would not be so bad if these were enjoyable characters to follow. They arent. Or rather, the majority of them aren't (Tyrion is a pleasant exception). If he picked a single character, that might make for interesting reading. Or if the characters were dynamic, that would be alright. The characters are too often like pieces of flotsam tossed on rough seas. Life is like that sometimes. But it doesnt make for good storytelling.The books I'm reminded of most to compare these to are Brin's Galactic Civilization books. He also split the story among many characters. But he did it in cliff-hanger serials with scrappy characters you wanted to like. Martin's characters are an often luckless assorment of not very interesing or fun people with lives that manage to be somehow boring against grand spectacle."
5,AN ABSOLUTE 10!,"Unlike many novels of this genre, this one uses the supernatural only as a delicate seasoning, enhancing, not overpowering. The real story is in the characters, exotic settings, and intense rivalries. My only complaint is why the author is keeping us waiting for the second course!"
2,Doom and Gloom? Leave the Children alone.,"(Spoilers) Having watched the HBO show of the Game of Thrones, I wanted to experience the books. I thought Game of Thrones was a very good story with compelling characters. Clash of Kings is very dark book. I have a particular issue with GRRM's continued plotline of children being brutally killed. The authors descriptions of the events is quite disturbing and had to put the book down.Alot of the characters act irrationally and unbelievable as the story goes along. Particurly the fate of Jaime Lannister. Not believable at all considering his family murdered her husband and was holding her daughters hostage.This book gets compared to LOTR. I agree that LOTR was too fairly tale with all of the main characters surviving despite numerous battles. Clash of Kings goes to the extreme in the other direction. There should have been happy medium for the Good Guys to win.Also missing thoughout Clash of Kings (unlike the tv show) is Robb Stark."
5,Excellent book and series.,"I do not wish to provide a spoiler to those of you who have not read this book/series yet.However, it is a well crafted book with good story, well developed characters, and will engage your interest."
5,"Like LOTR, but less boring.","A Clash of Kings is a great sequel to the most thrilling fantasy epic ever written. It's fast paced and compelling, and since you now know that no character is truly safe, you fear for every member of the Stark family as they struggle to survive, fight, and prevail over their enemies. The element of fear for these characters makes this a truly exciting novel."
4,Great book,Great book and a great series. I recommend this book especially if you like the HBO series. If follows very closely to the story line.
4,a clash of kings,"The authors series of books is very tolkien like. He has a vivd imagination and very creative when it comes ot creating ehat is basically a new language. Also he has created new and imaginative creatures, etc."
4,excellent,"positive: everything on time. The book is excellent, you should buy it. The seller is very professional.negative: the hard cover was a little damaged"
4,Transitional book of the series,"I found this book, the second in the ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" series to be very good. It moved the plot along and maintained interest even though it is quite a ponderous volume. I did find it a little disconcerting that the major players seemed to take a backseat to the supporting cast. With one major exception, even the battles--the clashes of kings--are reported on after they happen. Still, Martin creates a world and spins a web of characters that is remarkable. It is only when compared to the first volume in the series that I give it four stars."
3,clash of boredom,after the first chapter i was interested to read more but ive found this so far very tedious except for the Tyrion hope the next book is better reading these b4 watching the tv series where at least they can cut half of this tedium out:)
5,Great series,I guarantee you'll end up reading the whole series. Without fail a great series with complete characters and plots to keep you entranced.
2,Disappointed,"This book just feels like I am being played by the author. Many of the chapters barely move the action along. I was really invested in all the characters and wanted to know the outcome, but I lost patience about half way through. It really feels like there is about two full books worth of ideas and action being stretched into six (or seven) books. If you can read chapter after chapter without any real payoff or reward, then you have more patience that I do and you may enjoy this series. I am done."
3,A lot of hot air,Good book but is the start of Martin's let's fill up some pages. I just finished the forth book in the series and it was so full of useless background information that now I need to read fifth book to find out what is going on with half the characters from the previous book. I doubt that the fifth book will get to the point either. Find another author with another series. You would be wise to not invest your time with this series.
2,Frustrating.,"I bought this title for use with cello. What you can't tell from the title is that it is a violin edition. (There is no mention of this in the description). Thus, in order to use it, I must transpose from one clef to another. Or, as I did, I simply played the rhythms as if they were written in the bass clef. Works as long as you don't have a key signature involved. But why have a rhythm study that throws in a key signature issue at the same time? No point. Not worth the cost."
1,Not very funny. Don't waste your money!,"I purchased this video to show at a bridal shower. I thought it would be funny and entertaining. Thankfully, I viewed the tape before showing it at the shower. The tape now sits on a shelf, and there it will remain. It definately was not worth the money that I spent for it."
1,Don't waste your time,"I purchased this video to use for a vow renewal celebration. My mistake! Not only is it mostly not funny, the video footage is terrible and the hostess is no Bob Saget! Unfortunately, if this is what you're looking for, there isn't a lot of competition."
5,Wonderful Item!,"My Boyfriend's mouse died out on him and due to his ""old"" system we had no luck at all finding the mouse. I purchased this for him and it works wonderful, brand new... I am extremely happy with my purchase! and he is happy he can work again! Thank you!"
3,DECENT FOR THE MONEY,WORKS WELL AS LONG AS IT ISN'T USED ON A LIGHT COLORED MOUSE PAD OR SURFACE. OCCASSIONALLY THE CURSOR JUMPS AROUND THE SCREEN UNTIL YOU PICK THE MOUSE UP AND MOVE IT.
5,Takes sound from one place to another,"I'm no expert, but I purchased this spool because it is sheathed and I was installing it in a wall and through an insulated attic. Works great. The only reason I bought Monster Cable was because of the price I found. Otherwise, I would've gone ""generic""."
5,"Overkill for what I needed, but it got the job done.","I still have 400+ feet left, but I've got cable going through my attic to feed my surround channels now. Really good stuff...the outer jacket is soft PVC, and the insulation strips easy too. As someone who has worked with some good wire and some bad wire, this is good, though I don't like how Monster has positioned themselves and blow a lot of smoke and generally sell snake oil infused wire at a premium....but, this is very plain by their standards, and is of good quality, and not too expensive, all things considered."
5,Awesome,This is great cable and very well packages. Cable comes out of box on a spinning spool and cable has the length printed on the cable for easy matching
3,It's ok,"My son (22 months) really likes Big Bird, but this show doesn't hold his interest for very long. He likes parts of it, but most of the time he leaves it to go running around. The Baby Einstein first signs video is the one likes before bedtime. They show ""sleep"" right before it's over and he usually takes himself right into the bedroom when it's over."
4,Bedtime Stories and Songs,"My son likes this video; however, it does not help him go to sleep as of yet. Possibly its because he has a multitude of Sesame Street videos and there are parts that are re-used from different videos he already has. He is starting to get a little bored and needs some entirely new material."
2,Very disappointed... for non-content reasons anyway,"I am sorry my rating is actually low, as video's quality is higher than average. But I had to give it a low rating, because it won't open in the DVD player! I bought this with another Sesame Street video, and that one did play. This one would play only in the computer, which is not very convenient, as I need to show it to my daughter on TV.I am so sorry again. I did not expect this to happen. I won't buy any more DVDs on Amazon.com because of this."
5,I cannot imagine bedtime without Sleepytime Songs and Stories,"Although my husband and I always said TV would not play a part in our 19 mos. old son's bedtime routine, we have both come to love this dvd. It's some of Sesame Street's best, including one of my favorites from my childhood, ""Everybody Sleeps"". We don't use this dvd every night, but it is a sure-fire soother for when our little guy is all wound-up. I cannot reccommend it highly enough, and I only wish we had bought it sooner."
4,"Interesting show + Engaging Songs + No subtitles. So, very hard to sing along.","- The show is interesting.- The songs are engaging. What I hate about this DVD is it does not have subtitles as other Sesame Street. Consequently, it's very hard for the parents or teachers to sing along in order to encourage the kids to sing."
4,Real Deal,"Have to say that for the price I was skeptical - but this is a very sturdy, well built, all metal tool. For the price, you can't go wrong!"
3,Fine for the price...,"These are fine for the price, but the base on the one I received was uneven, resulting in the unit rocking back and forth. I had to take it to work and grind the base flat to be able to use it. I also glued a thin piece of sheet rubber to the base for slip resistance. After all that these are usable and should do the job."
4,Good for small soldering work,"The base of this product is nice and heavy and the arms stay put when you move them. One nice feature is the alligator clips can be replaced with just about anything that can be cut to fit the clamp hole (including other clips when they eventually wear out). The only downside for me is that my project is a bit bigger (doing wireframes for an art piece) so the cross bar is a bit short for that. Also I wish the bottom had a clamp so I could clamp it to the edge of the desk so it could hold more weight without tipping over. Right now I would guess it can hold about 2 lb (unsupported) with the arms outstretched. On the bright side, it wasn't too hard to fashion my own clamp since the bottom is flat."
3,Not what advertised.,"Jeweldent says it sells the Xacto stand. They dont, i got a flimsy little box that had very poor quality printing. It looks like a knock off. The item itself is neither good nor bad. It works but feels like it might fall apart. DO NOT ORDER FROM JEWELDENT!!"
4,"Great for holding, not for magnifying","For holding small projects this works great. It does need to be tightened up well or it will slide around, but that is not hard to do.The magnifier is nearly worthless though. It only works if the object you are looking at is perfectly centered, and the poor range of adjustment means that is almost impossible to do.I can easily get this to hold things just where I want them, but the magnifying glass just doesn't have the freedom of motion to line up properly. I just gave up on it and leave it hanging to the side out of the way."
4,Useful little tool,"I bought this in order to assist in soldering, and it does that job nicely. The base has a good weight and the magnifier does not overbalance the system, even with a circuit board held in the clamps.I am nervous about the teeth on the clamps damaging the traces on circuit boards, however. I would like to get some smooth jaw clamps for this to prevent that."
3,Eh,"This piece of equipment is helpful, but not the best.The alligator clips don't hold tightly, the magnifying glass isn't very strong or wide in diameter, and it's not easy to adjust.But it is somewhat helpful since I only have two hands, and one must hold the soldering iron and the other must hold one component and the clasp can hold another."
4,"Holds Great, Magnifies Poorly",I've started in on a project that requires a lot of small soldering work on circuit boards. My hands aren't very steady so I have difficulty with such small work. Added to that the tiny tiny color bands and markings on components were giving me a head ache trying to decifer them with my unaided eye. This gizmo seemed like the perfect solution to my challenges.It definately does a great job of holding small components steady for soldering and the adjustability of the arm positions works well. My only complaint is that the magnification is very low. Myabe 2X at best I think. Fortunately my vision just needed a very small boost to help identify the parts without getting eye strain so it works o.k. for me. If you can't see small stuff at all to start with this product may not provide enough magnification to help.Overall the construction seems to be sturdy and as noted by others the base is good and heavy for its size.
3,workable,"This works well, but there are 2 improvements I would look for if I were looking for another one...I would look for one with a heavier base - this one is too easily moved and tipped. It would also be able to grip bigger stuff.Otherwise - the arms adjust well, stay put while in use and the magnification is sufficient for the size of the unit."
2,Find a better one with a warranty,The second time I tightened the bolt for the magnify glass the threads stripped. Seems there is no warranty. Now if I want that to work properly I have to spend the money on the tools to fix it. Super. Spend your money on something of a higher quality.
1,glass not protected,magnifying glass chipped and scratched badly not ptrotected at all the way it is shipped the rest seems sturdy and think it would be great if they protected the lens
3,Cheap and easy,"I bought 3 of these spice racks because I was looking for something as cheap as possible that I would be able to hang on the wall to use for my spices so that I can free up counter space. And that is exactly what I got. The quality isn't the best, and it is a bit flimsy, but it does exactly what I wanted. I have them mounted on the wall so I don't have to worry about things falling off, they will fit different size bottles as well. So if you're looking for good quality, or even for something to look real nice, don't buy these, but if you're looking for something cheap and easy for the wall, this is it."
2,"Dense and frustrating, by design","The book is well-written and accurate, but it follows the instruction-by-example philosophy: to accomplish this task, open such-and-such an example file, then (1) select this tool, (2) click yonder icon, (3) run that menu command, and so forth. It carefully avoids explaining the concepts behind the operations, leaving the poor reader to deduce them (or, too often, guess at them). This approach makes everything five times harder to absorb than it ought to be.I found that I could often learn most effectively by glancing over a lesson to grasp its overall object, then figuring out the procedure on my own. It's pretty sad when an instructional book impedes the learning process to this extent instead of enabling it."
5,Adobe Acrobat 6 Standard classroom in a Book is Very Good,"Adobe Acrobat 6.0 Standard Classroom in a Book is very Good.It describes exactly how to accomplish basic operation clearly.Acrobat in common with other Adobe Products uses some non intuitive ways to get atbasics. This book shows the ""Adobe Way"""
4,Great inexpensive headphones,I use these headphones for my computer and find the frequency response to be be great with good bass response for my computer.
1,Worst headphone I ever bought,"I had a good experience with Panasonic headphones previously. So, I bought this RP-HT46 Headphone. I was very disappointed to say the least. The sound is very weak compared to other heaphones and there's no bass at all. Even though they are light, it's still uncomfortable to wear them due to its tight head band. I had to return it (even though they are cheap) just to make a point. Granted they were made in China, still I cannot believe Panasonic is putting its trade mark on this junk headphones."
2,"Decent sound, poor build quality","These headphones sound decent enough, and they're comfortable when everything is in working order. The folding feature is poorly executed. The metal pins have a tendency to slide out of place. If you're careful, you'll be able to re-insert them and re-assemble the headphones without bending the pins. Even if you are that lucky, the pins fall out often enough that your luck will run out eventually. You'll either bend the pins or mangle the plastic in the connector. I resorted to using a paper clip to replace the pins and making them long enough to bend them and prevent them from falling out. Not elegant or particularly ingeniuous, but a set of headphones shouldn't require any level ingenuity to make it functional."
4,Practical Unit,"The Panasonic headphone was purchased at Amazon to clearly hear television at one volume while the speakers were at another. It does the job nicely. The volume control works beautifully and the lightweight fit makes them comfortable. These are not meant for the serious audiophile who needs exceptional sound, but are fine for conversations. At Amazon's price, they are a good buy."
5,Valentine's Day in XXXHolic!,Valentine's Day is a special day where a female is expected to give a male of her liking some dark chocolate. This is meant as a gift of love the male is obligated to consider the female as a possible girlfriend. One month later is White Day where a male gives a female White Chocolate with the same obligations. This selection of the XXXHolic series shows the love or lack of love is affecting the characters. And there is this female hand rising from a grave that people can't seem to figure out. On to the next book! I learned about XXXHOlic from the Amazon Vine program and the pressure of having to buy Manga for my classroom. I like XXXHolic very much.
1,dora vanity,"cute vanity, my daughter choose this one over the Princess one but after a couple of months the hair is a mess! and now a year later it is totally unmanageable. You cannot run a brush through it or fix Dora's hair. I loved my style head when I was a little girl and wanted to find one of quality for my daughter but this was definitely not worth it!"
3,Tangled Mess??,"I agree this toy is great from the size, to the accessories, and even Dora's head... My problem is that the hair is a MESS! Am I the only one seeing this? My 5 y/o got this for Xmas and as of now (May) she barely plays with Dora b/c you cannot do anything with her hair. I've read on-line how to fix the hair but it's not working (detangle shampoo, Downy, wig brush only (this is key I think - that's the only kind of brush you are supposed to use with the American Girl dolls)... I'm contacting FP on Monday to see if I can get a new head for her.... Any other suggestions??"
2,What a waste of money...,"I got this for my daugher for her 5th birthday and she LOVED playing with it-as did her 2-year-old little sister. The problem is that once the hair gets tangled up, there is really no coming back from that. The hair on it is so ""plastic-y"" and cheap, that when I try to detangle it, it just stretches and breaks! I tried to order a replacement Dora head from Fisher Price, but they only sell replacement kits for the accessory pack (blow dryer, curling iron, barrettes, etc)-but no head. Alas, it sits in her room and does not get played with at all-will probably give it away to Goodwill or something to make room for something new this year. What a waste of money :/"
4,Great Vanity Overall,"My 2.5 year old daughter got this for Christmas, and it was a hit. She played with it for 2 hours straight. The novelty has certainly worn off, but she still uses it about 3-4 times a week.I thought that the sound was a little too loud, but it's not terribly anoying. The toys/tools are pretty well constructed, we haven't had any break yet. The mirror is also really good; it's not a sticker. I would buy it again if I had to.I love that it keeps her busy."
2,The Hair is poor quality...,"I purchased this for my daughter because she loves Dora and likes to play dressup. It's a fun toy, but the hair on Dora is poor quality. It has become so matted, it cannot be combed, basiclly adding less value to the toy. There isn't an easy way to remove the doll head from the vanity set. It's really not worth the price."
4,Dora fun,"I got this for my 2 year old daughter. She loves it. It is plastic so not sure it would handle hard use. As you remove the items to use them, the vanity talks. It also has cards you slide in and out and it talks of getting ready for one of the characters party. My 2 year old can put the cards in and out. My daughter has pulled the drawer out, but it just slides back in. We like it a lot."
2,Quite Disappointing,"Holcombe Waller has a pretty voice, it's true. But he makes terrible use of that pretty voice. For a particularly egregious example, listen to track 7 (""You Love Me"") which, much like track 4, is sugary pop dressed up as indie, alternative whatever. Newsflash: sugary melodies are sugary melodies whether they're about love or Condeleeza Rice, of all people.If he hired a decent producer instead of producing it himself, and if he collaborated with someone who knows how to write compelling music Holcombe Waller could really be something...."
2,Is it a crime to Plagerize Yourself????,"I was disappointed by ""Wisdom"" as I have liked many of the author's previous works. Most of his insights were very familiar to me as I'd just finished ""Invention of the Human"" and his thoughts on Shakespere here were almost word for word what was written there.I know many Orthodox Christians and Jews will disagree with the sections on Biblical and xtra-Biblical Wisdom. He seems to trust that the Gnostic Gospels and the Kabbala present a clearer picture of Judeo-Christian thinking."
1,Tedious,"The author does a fine job at sounding esoteric, but at the expense of the reader. He presupposes prior knowledge of his topic leading the unwary into a wearisome and verbose dialogue of nonsense. It is difficult to to remain on track and to know the author's direction.I am glad I checked this one out at the library first. Not one for my book shelf. My recommendation is to go to the primary sources in search of wisdom."
5,Open your mind to knowledge,"""Where Shall Wisdom Be Found"" clarified many of my ideas about the believes we have learned through our lifetime. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in the knowledge of our believes.Mary Pride"
1,This book displays a complete lack of wisdom,"Apart from learning from personal experiences, wisdom is found in learning from the collective experiences and mistakes of mankind. This means reading history and biography. A basic science literacy is also necessary - certainly one can find important lessons from cosmology and evolution. Only after history, biography and science does literature come into the picture, and even then to confine oneself to the literature of the West, as Bloom does, is shockingly short-sighted in both senses of the term. Judging by Bloom's works, one feels that he doesn't even realize such countries as China, Japan, and Iran even exist."
3,What a piece of crap?,After readng like 30 pages I ask myself why am I reading this? I am still asking the answer?
2,Hard to read,"without a great background of classical reading, this was the most difficult of his books to read"
1,Bennis' style is chaotic and has a serious left-wing bias.,"I agree with Bennis' premise that there is an ""Unconscious Conspiracy"" which sucks the life and creativity out of would be modern leaders. However, I was extremely disappointed in the chaotic prose and exclusive stabs at politically conservative leaders. For example, he highlighted Ralph Nader as an example of a good modern leader.Throughout the book, I had trouble figuring out what Bennis was trying to convey. I don't normally hate a book, having loved so many before. But I hate this one. Stick to Dilbert, it's more apropo."
1,80% Rant,"I am mystified why Peter Drucker would lend his endorsement to this book. I'm only 70 pages into it, but have elected to write my first book review because I DISLIKE this book!So far, I have read chapter after chapter of ranting about why the golden of age of America began in 1962 and ended in 1963. Television, fast food, yuppies, and above all, rock and roll, have conspired to corrupt America and with it, ostensibly, the world.What a crock! How about getting on with life!"
5,One of the most exciting books I have ever read!,"Warren Bennis has a talent for being able to see and articulate the ""big picture"" problems that are plaguing the majority of organizations today. He uses many, many examples to show cause and effect relationships between poor leadership and organizational health. He is an outspoken fan of creativity, vision, trust and momentum within the work force and exegetic in his treatment of corporations, colleges, the military, Non-Profits, etc.- He is blunt about greed, reactionism and hubris while presenting an exciting picture of our Country and it's potential when leaders (not managers) are allowed to instill hope in the people who do the work.I am buying a copy for each of my employees!!"
1,STAY AWAY!!!,"I have Adobe Premiere 6.01 and while it has good intentions, it is the ""buggiest"" program I've ever used. If you take one step forward, Adobe will take you two steps back. Fix one problem, two more will pop up. Playback problems, exporting problems, editing problems....Adobe should have kept this one until all the bugs were worked out. If you need proof, visit Adobe.com and browse through the hundreds of fed up customers on their Forum page. Ulead Media Studio Pro is a lot less painful to use, and you get the same results."
4,Great 80's Movie,"Cheesy 80's space movie, Molly Ringwald is awesome in it. If you don't like the cheesy stay out of the 80's"
5,Toshiba Regza 37HL67 LCD HD TV,"We purchased two of these Toshiba LCD TVs after I spent several months researching this brand/model and at Consumer Reports. They rated it as a superior set for quality, reliability, ease of use and overall quality of the picture and sound. We got rid of a JVC and an old Toshiba analog set in favor of this model. All I can say is that I am still astonished and pleasantly surprised at the crystal clear picture and sound! It is so clear compared to the reasonably good picture and sound we had on the old analog tube sets. And, we couldn't be happier with Amazon's good service, discount price and the on schedule delivery of our order which was free. Amazon and Toshiba deserve our five-star rating for this entire transaction."
1,TV only lasted 3 years!,What else can I say? I'm shopping for a new TV already. This is the shortest-lived TV I've ever owned in my over 50 years! I'm staying away from any Toshiba branded product after this experience.
2,unreliable color quality,Less than 3 years old and the color is saturated to a point it is unwatchable. Out of warranty and cost of repair approaches a new unit. Very disappointing.
2,Bad design,"I've had this TV almost three months. I got it about $150 less than Amazon's lowest price.The TV looks great in my small apartment, almost too big. The picture is great-I'm using it with DirectTv HD service. But the one thing that bothers me about the TV is the stand/base. You have to screw the base on manually. After having the TV for a few weeks the TV started to wobble. We had to take it down and tighten the screws, same thing happened a few week after that. My husband used both a hand and power screw diver to ensure a tight fit- but to no avail. The bad base would stop me from buying the set again"
5,Almost perfect,"After having done plenty of research, I ended up getting this model at an electronics store for less than it could be had for online. It was manufactured in April, and I bought it in May. It's done everything I'd hoped for and more. Using the digital tuner, it can pick up four of the five local channels in HD without a cable box by doing a cable scan. When I purchased it, I declined the 4(3)-year extended warranty because Consumer Reports said that there are very few repairs needed in the first year or two. There wasn't one mention of dead pixels. My chance to get the extended warranty would expire in 30 days, so when I noticed 2 dead (black) pixels on the 29th day, I went out and got the extra warranty because they (UE) provide better coverage than Toshiba would. The pixels don't bother me that much, but knowing it'll be less of a hassle to get it replaced if any more show up gives me peace of mind, despite it costing a couple hundred extra."
5,great product,"Have this TV now for 5 or 6 weeks, together with a $100 sony upconverting dvd player and the picture is just beautiful (who needs blu-ray).Watching my old dvd's looks so different now with so much detail that couldn't be seen before. Was originally trying to get a 1080p but after some research into whats available right now with this screen size and also reliability ratings, I decided on the toshiba. My old toshiba was a great tv, I hope this one lasts as long. One minor issue I have is if you use a surge protector and turn it on before you try turning on the tv, then it sometimes takes 2 trys and/or a short wait before you can actually turn it on. Overall, highly recommended (eagle shipping was a week late but I guess you can expect that)"
2,did not last long,After about 3 weeks and a very good performance picture wise thevideo went out and I had no problem to return it to Amazon .Helmut Kade
4,Great Flat Screen,"Finally, I can review a product I am happy with overall in price, shipping, and timeliness of receipt without any problems. Great overall picture with good clarity, and I really enjoy having a 37"" screen. However, I have 2 issues: 1 is that when showing videos on this television, they are very fuzzy and the picture comes out quite badly. Perhaps I need to read up on screen readjustments for videos, and 2, the volume control seems to not work properly. At 45, it just seems normally loud, but doesn't get as loud as I think it should. If I were to put my 27"" Sony that is downstairs at 45, I'd blast the roof off!"
4,SATISFIED,"Satisfied so far, have had it in operation for 3 weeks. No major problems.Have to get used to the delay between channels when you use the remote to enter new channel, not the channel up or down button. Not a biggy. Also the only screen that you can see the ticker tape on the bottom is the full screen. If you use the theater 2 or 3 the top of the heads goes away. Just a little problem not expressed in adds or brouchers.The TV arrived on the day the shipping info said it would, took 10 days as it came from Dallas,Tx to Seattle,Wa to Yakima,Wa to Cle Elum,Wa, and no broken parts!! Plugged it in, hooked up the anolog cable and great picture."
1,Broken Right Out Of The Box!,"This LCD brought me nothing but problems, It took them a week to get it to me and i took it out the box and it looked great however i plugged it in and all hell broke loose. The screen was broken, i couldn't see anything. When i wanted to get a replacement becuase i got it for a very low price i couldn't get it.Amazon warehouse only gives refunds on LCD's not replacements. And no telling when i will get the refund or when they will pick it up.Highly Disappointed!"
2,Screen cracked on arrival,Screen cracked on arrival. It was very difficult to obtain answer from Tiger Direct as to whether the TV would be replaced or whether I would have to obtain a refund from amazon. In the end amazon was prompt in organising a refund.
3,The secret a story of juvenile rheumatic arthritis,"Would nice if they had one to reepresent boys, my son has it and I would like one he could connect to easier."
3,Informative but very corny,"A pretty informative video, however it could have been condensed a bit. My wife and I learned a fair amount from it. Beware though, it is painfully corny. So corny, that it made us wince at times. Overall, it is recommended for first time parents to be."
4,A fun read!,"This book was very interesting to read. It consists of stories written by different authors that are all about South Africa and its justice system. My personal favorite story in this book was called, ""the toilet."" Sometimes the stories dragged on and were annoying, but overall its a fun read."
3,"""B.A.D."" to the bone.","Some people might just want the ""Greatest Hits"", but I'd actually rather have this album. It includes ""Rush"" and ""The Globe"", two hits that any alt-radio listener would know, plus the good tracks ""Can't Wait/Live"" and ""Innocent Child"". Also here is ""Green Grass"", which is a fairly catchy song, and I think contains a ""Kate Bush"" sample. The end of the disc isn't as strong, but it's still decent. Overall this is pretty good, it's no ""Clash"", but good."
2,BAD News,"As a massive fan of Mick Jones, and most things the former Clash lead-guitarist has ever done, i have tryed my hardest to like The Globe, but lets face it, this is BAD's worst album! its not the fact the line-up has changed, i meen Higher Power (under the name Big Audio) is up there with anything BAD ever done.This album lacks any real spark, it is innoative, something that Mick has always gone for in his music.Twon songs though do really stand out, the kool, ""Kool-Aid"", which i admit is a very enjoyable and entertaining song.Another stand out is the awsome ""Rush"", yes it does sound so much like The Clash's ""Should I stay or Should I go"", yes Mick exploited The Clash's new found popularity in UK and made this song the B-Side to Should I stay..'s Re-Release, but its still good.Then theres the awful tracks such as The Globe (which goes to far in the exploitation of Should I Stay...But honestly do try and buy any of the other BAD albums, after all their much better"
4,Art of Arantza,"The drawing is very good. The few men are definite body builder types. The women are drawn softer but still look strong. The poses indicate action, sometimes with mild threat, but no one looks really hostile. All drawings except the cover are in black an white, but it's still a great value. Arantza should sell a lot of art, whatever she decides to draw."
3,Fine but salt added. Why add salt to these?,"These are fine. As promised, they are flakes not whole beans. The only complaint I have is that they have added salt. As these are dried (really dried!), I don't think the salt has anything to do with preserving them. It is a lot better to be able to add salt if you want it and not be forced to eat a bunch of salt. Not for a low or no salt diet. They would be 4 stars if they didn't have all the salt added to them."
1,Don't walk BUT run away...,"If you're the type of person that likes to be mugged or have your purse stolen, then go ahead and buy from these people. OUTRAGEOUSLY Expensive for what you get."
5,Good,"Very easy to read and understand. Unlike (Reviewer: HowManyGospelsWereDestroyed?) who rants against everything religious (check out his/her reviews and you'll know), I am actually interested in pursuing the truth, and there is a lot of it here and easier to understand for someone who really wants to understand the all important truth, not rant against it."
4,Pleasantly surprised!,"Based on my view of the book referred to as the Living Bible (it was in fact neither living nor a Bible), I did not expect to approve of a translation carrying a variation of the same name. I was pleasantly surprised. The New Living Translation is an excellent version of the Bible and I often recommend to those who want a translation into simple, modern English. If the Contemporary English and Today's English/Good News translations appeal to you, then I would challenge you to look instead at the NLT. The translation is sound, the phrasing smooth and easily understood, and the language inclusive where appropriate. I would still place the New Revised Standard Version at the top of my list, but the New Living Translation is my second choice. I highly recommend it."
3,The lesser of the easy read Bible interpretations,"While it is easy to read I find it to be too far from the Hebrew and Greek texts to be used for study or teaching to those unfarmiliar or used apart from a more accurate translation to show that it is just trying to bring true text to life a bit more. Very good when used in conjunction with the ESV. I believe that it is a bit dangerous to submit people with poor knowledge of the Bible to an interpretation due to the twisting that can happen in reading. For those of you with less knowledge of the Bible please concider a more accurate version such as the New Century Version. Or if you are a bit higher english comprehension and want to really know what God says, bite the bullet and read and New American Standard Bible, its as close as there is to what God wrote in English. Also if you are interested in a high literary level that is very understandable, I would recomend the English Standard Version. This is the number one Bible I use in teaching."
4,Inspiring,"This is a 'way of life' eating instruction book that is easy to understand and doable for today's fast paced schedules. Most of us know that different types of foods trigger weight gain and water retention and other foods help with lowering cholesteral and assist with achieving the recommended vitamin and mineral intake. Jana explains all of this in language that anyone can understand, grasp and follow. Can't wait to get started."
3,Not another High Protein Low Carb Book Please,"If I read another high protein diet book I am going to scream. Here is what this one has to offer.Pros: Has great advice about weightloss but nothing earth shattering. Eat higher, good quality protein, lots of veggies, a little fruit and add calcium to your diet. Oh yes, and excercize is good for you.Cons: You either need your own personal chef or have scads of time to make the salads, fish dishes, etc... Oh yes and the food that she recommends are usually more expensive than what you probably already buy."
3,No secrets here,"Yes, another diet book. This one attempts to slim America by sharing the ""secrets"" that have worked for this Park Avenue diet doctor and her clients.The only problem: There's nothing new or ""secret"" here, and we all know that socialites drink like fish, smoke like chimneys, and frequent the plastic surgeon's office so often they should have frequent flier miles.Eat smaller portions. Push away the bread basket. Drink water instead of alcohol. Get 60 minutes of exercise a day. Sound familiar?I also had a problem with the ""Manhattan is the center of the universe"" attitude that Klauer adopted. You know, there are other states outside of New York, and we don't all have access to Central Park and NYC restaurants.All in all, it's not a BAD book. There's just nothing new. And nothing that's going to turn you into SJP overnight."
4,Very informative!,"I could not believe just how much I have learned from this book about calcium alone. I was amazed to learn that what you take it with, depends on whether or not you assimulate it. This book opened my eyes about several things diet and I thought I knew it all."
3,How do the Rich & Famous Really Get Thin???,"Yes, the book is a good read, however the information provided is not much of a secret. For the most part the wealthy remain thin via the use of amphetamines, and recreational drugs...I would bet money on it. I'm sure there are good many who do maintain an active lifestyle and try to eat right, but for the most part, it is latter. Instant gratification is what it's all about, and money can and will get you anything you want."
5,This CD rocks!!!,All ofv the specific aspects of this CD are so good that it blows me away. This CD is the best that I have ever heard. I love Rob Zombie.
1,you guys should give music for free insted of making us pay,give stuff like singels for mp3s and wimamps out for fre
2,Disappointed,"I got this book thinking it would be another book on alien agendas, coverups, abductions; the works. What I got instead is a book full of pages where it looked like someone's college notes that were published as a book! Other than that, the book arrived on time and seems to be in good condition. I thought I was getting a good deal for the price, but now I know why it came so cheap! Maybe I misread the description of the book, but it will be something sitting on my bookcase, cause I won't be reading it any time soon!"
5,Its about time.,Its about time we started to unfold this cover up and begin bringing out the truth about ufo's. This book starts it off right.
3,A UFO Document: Serious Business,"The author here has assembled an impressive store of official governmental releases pertaining to the UFO phenomenon from around the world. Most cases are visual & radar sightings that are compelling but very repetitive in nature. The author suggests that most governments are still covering up extensive evidence of extraterrestrial visitation to avoid public hysteria. His wish is for our government to really disclose all it knows about UFOs, but does not tell us what should be done beyond that. It would appear our civilization is ""helpless"" to affect the situation anyway, with or without all this undisclosed information... if what the documents say is true."
4,An assortment of the best,After reading and watching most of the better books and DVD's ( some of the not so good also ) I must say that these are the highlights of the cases that were really amazing to me and well documented that I had the pleasure to read. I can recommend this as a great book for those who would like a detailed over view of the best cases reported in my limted opion.enjoyputnam
4,fictionalized bio may be part of the point! duh!,"To the people complaining that he ""made up"" his military past: Did it occur to you that maybe that's PART OF THE POINT?! To fictionalize/shroud his character, as an added element that brings further meaning to his work! Lots of artists do that sort of thing, & have perfect creative license to do so. (It's not like he was running for office, here, folks.)...No one seems to have a problem with Banksy's ""mysterious"" existence; Andy Kaufman's entire career was based on us not ever really knowing who he was (and sometimes having OTHER people portray him/his characters); we went crazy with glee when Sasha Baron Cohen passed himself off to unsuspecting ""regular folk"" as Borat/Ali G/Bruno/etc. I can't speak for this artist, but I presume the ""biography"" is part of the art, and, besides, if you remove the knowledge of the artist, the work is still pretty great & speaks for itself!"
1,Totally Bogus,"Micah Wright admits to lying about being a Ranger, fighting in Panama and many other things. Check out his web site: (http://www.micahwright.com/ranger.htm). He made the whole thing up!So why should anything else he says or writes have any value?"
1,Witchhunt,"To me, there's a serious probllem of double- speak coming from many reviewers here. 1. it seems to me that many who like this profaneness also dislike bush, the millitary and iraq in the current events. 2. yet to me, that's where they stop. All they know how to do is criticize whithout coming up with valid counters to replace what they're criticizing. To me, it seems that if these reviewers seriously cared about the military men and women, and the direction of the country (whcih they consistenly say is disastrous) then they'd do more than just get in their cheap 2 cents by smearing bush in whatever they force to be correlated, no matter how irrelevant. Are many of the ones who like this book democrats? by how they write their severly narrow-minded scoldings of bush, they sure love to impersonate all teh democrats doing it right now in the senate"
5,Smart and entertaining,"I find it frightening that Wright has been called a communist for expressing his First Amendment right to self-expression. Can there be an act that defies the do-as-you're-told mentalities of communism more than expressing yourself even in the face of mass disapproval? And for that matter, is there even mass disapproval or just a handful of lonely fascists with intolerance to diversity? I'm betting on the latter.Back the Attack is a funny, smart and entertaining look at a shocking mentality that's taken a hold of our country and should be applauded for it's originality and bravery. Disagree with Wright all you want, just don't call him a communist or question his patriotism for doing what any American should be proud to do."
1,Author admits not being a Ranger,Enough said. Wright lied about his service history - he never was a Ranger.Lovely; so much for the (so-called) enlightened opposition.
4,"Hilarious, timely, incisive","First, yes he lied. Wake up, the author is just another reader, as is said in postmodernism. It doesn't matter whether Micah lied, or whether he is a murderous demon or another incarnation of Hitler.It's the book that matters.It's very funny and well taken.The followup book is decent as well, but round 3 is getting a little repetitive and uninspired."
2,Unfortunately He Turns Out To Be A Fraud!,"Considering the author's recent revelation of lying about his past as a Army Ranger has cast a pale shadow over this book of antiwar posts. Whether you adopt a liberal or conservative point of view. You have to consider that the author was lying about his military record and experiences in 1989 Panama that never happened, in fact he was never in the military. I sympathize with his political stance but it's difficult to support this book in good conscience. It certainly gives a political black eye to people who adopt similar political views."
4,"ranger or not, that doesn't change the posters",What Micah was doing in this book doesn't change because of a lie about his background. The propaganda is still brilliant.
1,Utter trash,"Methinks Mr. Wright should move to another country, say North Korea, and see how much ""better"" the quality of life is there. Of course he's allowed to criticize...that's freedom of speech. But like many liberals he complains and offers no solutions of his own. It's sad when people put partisanship before their country."
5,Gold-plated monkey wrench in the propaganda machine's gears.,"In-freaking-credible! Micah has taken WW2 posters and detourned them into new messages against the creeping fascism the USA finds itself in today. The typical visions of charging soldiers, the Statue of Liberty, and various patriotic images are framed with ironically Orwellian slogans or calls to rebel and protest. Perfect for enlarging as protest signs, or copying and leaving on a public bulletin board or under an SUV's windshield wiper.Next to each poster is a text written by the Center for Constitutional Rights, giving further detail to the message of the poster.Anyone even remotely interested in curent politics, or political activity should buy this book. Better still, reproduce the images (something the artist encourages in the inroduction) so others can be enlightened.Buy this book...while you still can!"
5,"Powerful, Edgy, Funny",These posters speak for themselves. Every conscious American will love this book....
5,Johnny Horton: I'm A Fishin' Man DVD,"Just recieved this new DVD. Johnny Horton has long been one of my favorite singers. I believe his early death on that Texas highway robbed the world of a voice that would have been one of the best in country music's history. It was great seeing him perform some of his greatest hits.The picture and sound quality are not pristine, but lets remember, these tapes or 52 - 60 years old. That said they are enjoyable. I watched it with a smile on my face from beginning to end. The disc price is a bit pricey at $40 bucks... but the rarity of this makes it totally worthwhile.How Johnny Horton is not in the Country Music Hall of Fame is beyond me. His influence and talent live on to this day!"
5,pastor manual,This is a great help for a pastor.It help me preach a funeral and we help me on future services.
3,Hmm...,"Well, the features of this product are amazing, and it's definitely a great solution to video editing. But this is only true once you learn how to use it! At first you have no idea what's what, and it's the typical Adobe product with windows all over the place. Sure, it's a great product, but it's only for those who have lots of time to sit down and learn how to use it."
2,Very disappointing. A direct ripoff of sooo many other fantasy books.,"I read Britain's first book Green Rider, and it really wasn't bad - so I was quite looking forward to the second one. Sorry to say though, it wasn't worth the wait. It's dull, trite, very predictable and pretty much a direct plot rip-off of at least 10 books that I can think of (George R.R. Martin is a MUCH better writer, so don't 'borrow' part of his plot - it shows!) She also has some really horrible writing in this one. I'm having a hard time finishing it and certainly won't be buying the third one."
3,This was a good story,"I really enjoyed this story a lot, until I got to the end. Aren't Zachary and Karigan going to end up together some how? I thought it was a horrible ending. Is Kristen Britain going to write another book?"
4,Great second book,"I was really looking forward to this book having loved the first so much and Mrs. Britain did not disappoint me. I found the way each rider heard the call very original along with many other concepts in both books. The author doesn't try to impress you with her vocabulary, she just tells the story. The result is two books that are good for adults and young readers alike."
5,Fantastic book!,"First Rider's Call, sequel to Green Rider, is really excellent. It continues the story of our favorite green rider, Karigan. After resisting the call for about a year, she finally succumbs to the wills of Lil, the first green rider. Although this book was somewhat less exciting then the first, it was definatly the better of the two. Karigan grows into a more developed charater as do those around her. The story focuses on the beginnings of the Green Riders, and the influx of magic that's effecting the surrounding land. The ending does not dispoint but is bittersweet leaving many issues unresolved. I'm personally looking forward to the next in this intriguing series."
2,First Rider's Call: Green Rider #2,"The correct book.... But the book is bigger then a normal size paperback (about half a size bigger)That was not written anywhere on the products info page. Only that it was to an Bargian Price. I have kept the book, but is a little sad about the size of it.The Story is on the other hand the right one, and just as perfect as hoped for."
3,Could Have Been Better,I read this book a while ago and found that the first one was much better. It seems that Karigan complained and whined about how life is unfair and the plot seemed a little dry in some areas. I can only hope Britain's work on the third book is better.
4,"Enjoyable followup to ""Green Rider""",I liked it; I did not start reading series until 1st 4 books were published or I think I would have been ticked off waiting 4 years between books. Did not perfectly seem to fit with first book and did not seem to be a complete story arc in and of itself (definitely would not read without first reading first book in series).
5,"First Rider's Call (Green Rider, Book 2)","A very well written sequel to ""Green Rider"" with lots of action and detail to the story."
3,"Please, let there be a third!","While First Rider's Call may have been a bit slow, I still read it straight through. I was captivated by the first one and hooked by the second. The only problem was I was so dissapointed by the ending that I wanted to cry. I say, if there's a third there's still hope, but if that is where the second one ends then I'm tragically caught in a web over a large rivine in concern to Kristen Britain's Green Rider books."
4,Great Read,"I thought this was great except for the longwinded descriptions of the sentience's actions in Blackviel Forest. I was disappointed with the end relating to Karigan and the king. It was a bit sad...But I found the description of the relationship between Alton and his cousin darkly entertaining. For the basic story action, the first book was a tad better but I love the character development in this one, especially relating to their romantic lives."
4,A Young Mercedes Lackey,"The flavor of The Rider's Call reminds one of the writings of Mercedes Lackey. She spins a tale to hold your interest and thankfully minimizes scenes of blood and gore! I enjoy the thinking of the reluctant heroine and her internal struggle to complete her task that she has been called to do. She portrays character growth and makes choices that reveal ethical strength. I was transported to another world, what a vacation!"
5,Continued enjoyment,"I liked First Rider's Call as much as I liked Green Rider. There is adventure, magic, intrigue and wit all written wonderfully into this story. I think that Britain is very talented to be able to use typical magic, but weave it into a book that isn't like anything else you have ever read. Recommended to anyone who liked Green Rider or just enjoys a good fantasy book in general."
5,Stunning Sequel,"Despite Britain's debut novel ""Green Rider"" being capable of standing alone - if you ignore the question of what happens next with the breach in the D'Yer Wall - Kristen Britain comes through with a sequel worthy of her amazing series opener. The good-versus-evil plot thickens without being resolved (after all, that's what book 3 is for), new characters appear wonderfully realized and fleshed out, and the romantic subplot tangles into a gratifyingly complex knot. The tensions at the end of the book leave the reader avidly craving the next volume."
5,Awesome,Great book. I couldn't put it down. I can hardly wait for more books from this author to come out.
4,My Opinion,I felt that this book was a very good sequel. The only problem I had with it was the abrupt ending! When will the next book be ready? I want answers!!!
4,Good for the nightshift,"I am not a game man myself, but this is a fun game for when the nighshift starts to become booring. Fits easily into the inside pocket, so you can take it anywhere."
1,Didn't Last,After only a couple of washes these sheets began to fray. Then they completely came apart before the year was up.
5,good and cheap,i use it to connect my ps2 to my computer's soundcard so i can hear the game via my speakers/headphone while using the computer LCD as display.
2,"Save your money. If you still want to try it, buy Traders and Barbarians expansion instead","I bought this expecting it to add to the Settlers of Catan experience. It didn't really enhance the game at all.I was disappointed. I think I played it once before giving it away.As far as durability goes, it's a single cardboard piece that can be bent easily. Furthermore, the directions for this are printed on the BACK of this cardboard piece. How dumb is that? You have to scan or copy it if you want to refer to it during the game.NOTE: You do not need to buy this addition if you plan to buy the Traders and Barbarians expansion, as it is included in that, along with the Fishermen of Catan addition."
4,Catan Rivers of Gold,"We found this expansion plays better when we play 5-6 players rather than 2-4. (Fishermen, on the other hand always plays great- 5 Stars for that) Since players can't set up on the three River tile inserts, it eliminates a large part of the 19 hex tiles to work with. With the 30 tile 5-6 player game these three hexes aren't so significant in the initial set-up.These Gold bonus hexes will usually produce about 5-6 victory points with one player taking 3 VP and another 2 in an average game. The real key to how agressively players pursue these Gold VPs is the numbers in the hexes. If those numbers are 5,6,8 & 9 the rush will be fast. If the numbers are 2,3,4,10,11& 12 the rush will be proportionally less.I'd say for the ocassional player, they could take-it or leave-it on this expansion. But for avid weekly players Rivers is a ""must have"" $3.00 piece of cardboard."
3,River tile for Settlers,"We liked playing with the variation offered by the river tile, just to make the game a bit different. Make sure you make a copy of the rules, written on the back of the tile, so you have this to refer to as you play."
4,Settlers of Catan River Tile,"This is a great addition to any Catan game and my family loves to use it. The only problem we have with it is that the three-hex tile is slightly smaller than our game hexes. Granted, we have the latest edition of Catan & Cities & Knights and the River Tile may be from an older edition... but it doesn't fit quite right with all the rest of the hexes so there's little gaps between it and the rest of the game. Also, don't let it get bent, it's very hard to get it to lay flat again once it's bent! Other than that it's great piece and we enjoy it very much!"
2,Not worth it,"Obviously this is a cheap add-on to Catan, but even so, I'd say it's not worth it. It hardly changes the game-play at all, such that after a few times playing the game with it included, players started ignoring the fact that it was a different part of the board and didn't even bother collecting ""gold""."
3,The River - Settlers of Catan,Fun little addition to the Catan Series. Played it with the standard game all they way up to Cities and Knights with Seafarers. Just creates more varieties of scenarios you can enjoy.
2,Not what we expected,"This didn't look nearly as fun once we got it. In fact, after reading the directions, it looked confusing and like it didn't have enough pieces to make it work properly with the game. We returned it and didn't even play it. Disappointed"
5,Interesting,"It is really interesting for manufacturing or management. It will definitely give you an advantage in management when you understand how to avoid blaming the wrong things (or the wrong people) for set backs or waste. It also helps you avoid doing useless things that don't do any good in managing. It also makes me realize there once was, and should again be, a reason to even have management in businesses."
5,Terrific!!,"I've had this CD over a year now and it's been a favorite of my family. Along with Haris Alexiou, George Dalaras really conveys the spirit of what is so wonderful about Greek music. So get this CD, and site down with a glass of wine (or ouzo, if you're adventurous) and let the music take you away!"
2,"Brisk production, poor video quality","Vision Video Classics, the distributors of this 1947 British production, has put out a very poor-quality copy of this fine film. Cedric Hardwicke is suitably striking as the title character, and all of the actors are wonderful, with the director giving the lengthy story a brisk, energetic pace.But the print itself is very dull and muddy, with tons of scratches and video clutter, and as far as extras, there are NONE, not even so much as chapter breaks, or a menu screen, other than a brief advertisement for their other ""Christian"" videos with a toll-free number to call. Too bad a better print of this excellent Dickens adaption couldn't be put out by a company who would do a better job of cleaning and restoring these worthwhile period films."
4,Poor Quality DVD,"I love this movie and gave it 4 stars, but the DVD from Vision Video is of such poor quality, I had to return it. I have other old Dickens like Lean's Oliver Twist, so I thought this would be as good, but, golly, it's so faded you can hardly view it. And no skipping to scenes. If you have the VHS tape, hang on to it and wait for a better release. Critereon take a hint."
4,Underrated Dickens Gem,"I'd worn out my video copy of the 1947 NICHOLAS NICKLEBY and had almost despaired of its ever appearing on DVD, when low and behold my prayers are answered! The production values aren't quite up to the David Lean Dickens masterpieces, but the actors are universally fine, particularly Sir Cedric Hardwicke as the heinous Ralph Nickleby and a heartbreaking Aubrey Woods as Smike. The film features a host of recognizable character actors, including Stanley Holloway and Sybil Thorndike, and viewers familiar with the 2002 feature film would enjoy comparing Christopher Plummers performance with that of Hardwicke."
1,Don't buy - terrible quality reproduction,"Such a great classic... too bad the distributor, Vision Video, does not say it looks like a poor-quality copy of another poor-qualitycopy. Some parts are so bad it is difficult to discern what is happening. Sorry that Amazon allows vendors like this on their website. I will think twice about any further purchases."
1,Nicholas Nicleby on dvd,"I love this film I have seen it several times when TCM plays it. However I did not like the quality of the film, it had not been remastered. The TCM channel shows the movie very clear and crispy. I was very dissapointed with the dvd."
4,One Question,"I have but one question. If a weather ballon fell in your back yard, do you think the military, then or now, would spend all the time, money and energy validating it?Wouldn't it be very obvious it was a weather balloon? Why the secrecy? Why the blockades, the obvious panic displayed by the government?It was apparant that balloons fell to the earth at this time, but there is not one case documented that the government went to such an EXTREME to note that it was a balloon and not an UFO.Read the book and see what you see."
3,Too many rumors.,"This is an interesting book, however, it listed too many rumors that the authors have heard. I was expecting to read it with scienfitic analysis. Although those rumors are quite interesting and could be true, but the authors did not actually further investigate. Therefore, it can't be taken seriously as a book that you can prove that it really happened in area 51."
1,Never got it!...Yes I did!,"Still waiting - going on two months now. I'll post a better review if I ever get the book.Edit: Well, this is embarrasing - I did receive this book and in good time, too! It just got buried under things. I will read it this week. Sorry, I don't know how to change the Star rating above."
1,A Waste Of Money,"I was given one of these as a gift. I replaced it in my Dolby Digital DVD to Amp signal path. It sounds no better than the cheapo Wal-Mart video coax cable I had been using for a couple of years. Then I thought, isn't that the whole reason to go digital in the first place? 1's and 0's don't know the difference between Oxygen-free copper and regular wire! Save your money."
4,Hatfield is mistaken,The Hatfield reviewer doesn't know what he's talking about. A regular RCA cable will transmit some signal but will NOT transmit digital audio no matter what brand it is. You must have a digital coax to do this.Monster makes a great affordable digital coax and this option provides the advantage of durability when compared to the optical cables.
4,CoLAB as in: CoLAB-eration,"Kurt et al doing what we,as Lambchop fans expect- Painting some wonderful pictures and doing some ""electronic noodle-ing"".You would really be hard-pressed to find any Lambchop album WITHOUT some electronic noodle-ing.(Thanks Mark Nevers?) It seems Kurt might be searching for a new vein to mine and the boy releases everything.See C'mon/No You....So,buy it,enjoy it and just wait to see what happens next.Good CoLAB-eration."
2,Sunday School Book,"Have you ever heard of a SWOT analysis? If you have, then this book is not for you. This book is very good for an entry level book. The authors have very little successful experience in business plan writing and the tasks they include are elementary. You would be much better off reading and intro to marketing textbook instead. The textbook would cover fundamentals of marketing. I respect the authors background, but most people would be better off with a different book."
3,Kodak printer cartridge,"The service from Amazon is always superb, however, the Kodak printer cartridge was less than adequate. In purchasing the Kodak ""40"", and from past experience, we expected 40 prints from the camera dock. Thanks to Kodak packaging, it is only available with the printer ink and photo paper combined. The ink cartridge only produced 18 prints and we have tons of paper left over that is unusable for all intent and purpose. Guess it's time to get a new camera..."
5,Great deal on Kodak printer items,This was the most reasonable purchase of the Kodak PH40 cartridge and paper I've received.
2,Kodak Refill kit Review,"I received the product but there was no ink inside, so I contacted the buyer and he refunded my money. Overall, my experience would be a 5 out of 10."
3,Review of Kodak PH-40 EasyShare Printer Dock Color Cartridge & Photo Paper Order,"I was disappointed that the ""new"" item didn't come in the Kodak box! Other than that, the item itself was okay."
1,Get twice as much for $10 more,Newegg has 80 picture double packs for $33. I went there after amazon would not free ship!
2,Ink runs out!,"We have had very good results with the photos that printed. However, the ink cartridge runs out before printing all 40 of the blanks that are included in the kit. We now have a total of 48 blanks with no ink!"
2,Kodak PH40 Media Cartridge for Kodak EasyShare Printer Docks,While I love having the printer dock- the printer cartridge runs out long before the paper does. It would be much better if they sold the printer cartridge by itself. I would gladly stock up on those. Hopefully this will be something Kodak does in the future. If not I'm sure another company will start selling cartridges that are compatible.Bottom line- too expensive when you can't use all the paper cause you got no ink!!!
2,Kodak PH-Easyshare Printer Dock Color Cartridge & Photo Paper,The photos came out with lines on the edges of the photo paper and couldnt print out as many photos with the cartridges.I can print 20-30 photos on 1 cartridge but these didnt do that.So alot of my Christmas photos were unable to be printed & the others had lines on each side of paper.I was going to get in touch with you to let you know but waited til Christmas was over.Im disappointed in what I got.
4,Kodak Printer Dock Color Cartridge refill kit,Exactly what I was looking for since Office supply stores no longer sell this. Printer still works well and is easy. I will definately buy more.
4,kodak easy share ink and cartridge set,"this product works great, the option to get kodak paper is very easy, but to pick up just the ink cartridge is very diffcult and would like to see this become a little more easier for people like myself who do not use the computer a lot. would like to see this user friendly."
1,Old paper,This product was in a old box and it had a tag on it from the goodwill for 6.99 and I paid a lot more then that. this was totally stupid.I have ordered a lot of things on line.I do not think i will in the future
3,Mrs. Perry,"I was pleased with the quality of the photos. However, the ink runs out before the paper does. I have 8 remaining blank sheets(out of 40) and no ink."
1,Dissatisfied.,"I ordered an out of stock from kodak film cartarage. I ordered it from Amazon.com because I thought it would be a good one. But you subed it out to another company and I a piece of junk. The film was coming out of the cartarage, my wife tried to put it back in, but it wouldn't work. When I tried to return it, it wasn't returnable because it came from another company, whom you subbed the order out. I wound up paying good money for a piece of junk that I can't return. You've probaly figured it out, I'm disatisfied and won't be ordering anything more from you!.Claude"
1,Cartridge had only 11 photos on it . Was supposed to be new with 40. Returned it.,"The cartridge produced good photos for the eleven pictures. Since it did not come directly from Kodak, someone used it before selling it to me. Kodak has discontinued making the PH-40 so we are the mercy of resellers."
1,huge waste of money,Ok I have owned this printer dock for a while when I used it to print up pics from a trip and I was able to print a few pics then the ink ran out so I went to get another cartridge and continue then same happened. My printer is so much faster and better for this job that I have never gotten another cartridge. Save your money and use the regular printer
1,I feel I was sent an expired kit,"I paid double for this Kodak kit to begin with (because the kit is now out of production and only available online). However, the pictures I have tried to print are very poor quality. I have always been able to print high quality pictures on my little printer until I tried this cartridge. I have thrown the box so cannot say for sure, but feel I have been sold an expired kit. I really should be refunded for this product."
3,Kodak PH 160,"Kodak has a wonderful product here, however, you can't find it anywhere anymore.Soooo, those of us out here needing this are all alone."
3,"Bulk Product, NOT Retail Packaging as Shown","Illustration shows retail packaging, but product arrived in loose packages of photo paper and the film cartridges. Labeled with Kodak labeling, and I have no reason to doubt it's OK, and will work OK, but informational material should clearly and prominently state that this product is not in original retail packaging.Somewhat delicate plastic film cartridges were shipped only in padded shipping envelope. Product made it OK, but could easily have been damaged in transit. I would think a carton would be more appropriate for protecting the items in shipping."
5,Happy with my purchase.,I have the Easy Share Dock since 2004 and I find it works very good for me. I was disappointed when Kodak discontinued the cartridges. But I was happy when I found out I could order it through Amazon. I hope this will continue.I take a lot of pictures and find it is easy when I can edit and print them out myself.
3,Not enough info,I ordered this because mine broke. I had to compare pictures to see if it was like mine. Everything looked the same but when I got it my camera doesn't fit the dock so I can't use it plus it was packed very loosely in a box that was too big for it. Hopefully I can find someone who I can sell it to. Steve Tomminger
4,Very good,Very good. What else do you want me to say. It is either good or bad and if it was bad I'd return it.
2,Mission: Impossible,"Not one interview, not one picture; no screen tests, no deleted scenes nothing. Nothing I could not get on TV land. The only advantage of course is no commercials and I can watch them whenever I want to. By the way this is not a good time (07-16-2010) to buy this set. You can buy them separately for over $20.00 less."
5,Love this series LOVE it Love it,I can't wait to start watching it. No problems with shipping it and no problems from the outside. I have not started watching it yet so I hope all the discs work.
5,MISSION IMPOSSIBLE COMPLETE SERIES,"I want to thank you for offering this series, it made my son, who is 51 yrs old, very happy at Christmas. It is of very good quality and I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoyed this television show when it was being shown in prime time.Again, thank you for having this complete series for all to enjoyDianne Bird"
4,Truly a Mission Impossible,"Remember record players?? How about 8 track tapes?? Or maybe reel to reel tape players... If you said yes you are going to love these movies. Straight from the 60's and 70's Mr. Phelps is in action, with Cinammon, Barny and Rollo. Don't try to get to technial... These cars still burn leaded fuel.. Enjoy"
4,Great until the last season.,"I have enjoyed watching this TV series over the past few months, but worried about the packaging because of previous experiences. The plastic centers that hold the disks on many of the last seasons were broken into tiny pieces. I knew it was only a matter of time before I got to the one that was scratched by the tiny pieces of plastic. Sure enough, the next to the last disk is damaged. It's really frustrating because these were sold to me as NEW and now 6 months later it's hard to know how to replace this one disk. My message to the manufacturers: There are plenty of tried and true DVD packagings that work. I'll pay the extra pennies for the good ones, no complaints."
2,Nothing Much to Write Home About,"I must have missed something, considering the amount of praise heaped on the author on the dust jacket, I thought I was about to read War and Peace. There was nothing new here, and the story line moved around like a heart monitor display - no consistent track - grabs something here, something there. This really is a very disappointing book."
1,You can even sell these songs individually,"It will be helpful if you can sell this kind of songs with different language , individually like all other CD's sold on Amazon. If someone like the whole CD, well and good. But if i like just 4 songs i wont spent all that money buying all other songs ,i don't understand what they are singing about."
2,acid alkaline diet,I was hoping this book would give me recipes to follow. Examples of weekly menus would have been nice. I was hoping for something more.
2,Once is Enough,"Grab a glass of water if you are going to read this book in its entirety as it is one of the driest reads on this subject.You will have no problem finding a stack of books that tell you how to tract your own ph and with less clinical of an approach. The food comparisons were nothing new and the information has been surpassed by more current approaches, more interesting formats and more inspiring dialogues.This book might be useful for students studying to be dieticians but his textbook prose was disappointing.Nothing new unless the reader has never read any books on Acid vs Alkaline lifestyles prior to this writing.Once is enough, reading Vasey's book, no need to keep it for referential reasons."
2,so so !,I was a little disappointed on this book..I give it 4 out of 10...I like Sang Whang 's book much better ! Reversing age ! its easier to Read and much better book !!! get Sang Whangs book !!!!!! you will love it !
5,Best Book on Topic At Time of Purchase,"I bought this book about 3 years ago. At that time it was the best book I'd come across on this topic. The author clearly explains the basic concepts and clarifies some myths people may believe about what constitutes acidity and what doesn't. The book is brief, user friendly, and contains helpful lists."
3,Didn't Al Kaline Play For Detroit?,"The book is dry without miraculous cures or backbiting scandals - Vasey defines pH & proceeds to qualify almost every food as alkaline or acidic (although their translated variations become alkalinizing & acidifying??) - He further quantifies the same as slightly, mild, or strong. Apart from food selection, he mentions alkaline salts to remove excess acid.Some of Vasey's information contradicts earlier texts - For example, he claims millet is the most acidic grain, whereas every other book I've read speaks of millet as the most mucusless,alkaline grain (along with buckwheat). Who knows who is right?There is enough new information to recommend this book, just don't expect to be dazzled - I originally encountered Vasey via his website & product line of alkaline supplements which are excellent..."
4,Acid-Alkaline Diet for Optimum Health by Vasey,"Well organized & professionally written ... for a reasonably knowledgeable audience. I'm new to the subject and not put off by technical terms. The author explains them clearly. Incls. tables, resources, and an index. Good as an introduction and for later reference."
3,Good basic information,"Contains great basic information on pH balance. It reads almost like a science book but well worth the read to understand how to balance pH. It is not a fanatical diet book, just good information. I am keeping it as a reference book."
3,The Controversy Continues,"So far I've read four different books on this subject, including this one, and EVERY ONE states different things about what is acidic and what is alkaline. They also don't explain why, according to their diet, half the American population should be dead. Period. I don't care how much mineral reserve you have, or how adaptable the human body is, nobody should be able to survive smoking, drinking little or no water, drinking coffee and soda, and eating no fruits or vegetables. And yet, half the people I know fall into that category and aren't dead.So, while I am giving this book a decent rating for recommending eating more fruits and vegetables, and cutting down on some other foods (meats), and that seems to be a healthy way to eat across the board, it doesn't adequately explain itself, so I'm rating it lower."
1,Don't waste time and money on this book,I was waiting for this book for months and was very disappointed. It does not cover anything new nor undocumented features. One of the most misleading title and an absolute waste of $. Two thumbs down.
4,Tough but good book.,"As did someone in a previous review, I bought this book for a bit of help in an advanced graduate-level math class. This book provides a lot of Bessel function examples. It really is a problem-based text with tons of pertinent examples. Most of my learning was done by reading/trying the examples and then relating them to homework problems."
3,"Horrible sound, fine though","Horowitz plays the concerto like he does; i love to watch him play anything, especcially something that is so difficult that, for him, looks so easy. The recording is horrible though. The balance between orchestra and piano is off, and there is a static sound much of the time. I would not like to have this on CD, it would bother the heck out of me...Sounds like a home video recording."
5,One of the best Science Fiction ive read,"I was lucky eanough to be able to read the entire series when it first was published in paperback and loved it. Ivew read it several times and never get tired of it. The way the storyline unfolds and the way the characters are described makes you feel that you are right there in the middle of it, and the political concepts are mindboggling. I just wish he had continued the series even after the colapse of the Soviet Union."
3,it's ok,"this book may give you the tips and good moves, but it doesn't exactly explain how to do the moves, like how to set the opponent up to get him in the stone cold stunner."
1,WWF is a Joke,"I am 30 years old from Atlanta Georga as a former WWF wrestling fan, I am now completly against the WWF. I am a member of a small organization working to ban WWF from television. Our work is going VERY well and we are well on our way. I have heard that WCW is a cleaner less leazy company. I have not gotten a chance to catch it's Monday Night shows but I will see for my self next week. I am now getting 10 of my friends from California to join my organization. When they join, I will have 40 people against the WWF."
3,Just ok,"could have used more pictures to illustrate the displays at the musuem. I was there several years ago and was interested to see what, if anything had been added."
1,defective product,"Tried to install this program, couldn't it is defective.tried to get support from adobe, which is like asking for a kidney.sent multiple emails to ctraltdelete computers, which resulted in no help, andI still cant get information about returning it and getting a refund, they onlyavoid that subject.all in all, the program wont install due to defective merchandise, and thecustomer support deserves a zero rating."
4,Great Program but....,"I jut purchased my first editing program adobe premiere 6.0 and it's really fun but.... I was amazed that if you owned a pc that I couldn't import music right off of a music cd. I have another program that came with the computer I purchased and it imports music cd's just fine with out having to covert them to a wav file. I paid how much for premiere, and it can't do what this free program can? Ca'mon premiere lets step it up and add this wonderful feature."
5,Like butter or better . . . .,"This is just the smoothest prose. I loved this book, it was a joy to read."
3,Typical Ani,"If you enjoy Ani you will like this compulation. She is very original and this album captures her greats. I guess you would have to call it a folkie type album, maybe more like a hippie-folk would be more fitting."
4,The Amazing Ani.,"Ani DiFranco has done it again ... piercing lyrics, harmonious vocals, no nonsense approach to life and love. Excellent. Amazing."
5,Let's kick off!,"I got this book to refresh my routing skills and ultimately to take the lab. It was OK and well organized with enough examples to walk you through the steps required to take some further steps! To be honest the only section that I didn't like much was its redistribution chapter but the rest of the book seemed very interesting to me. Although it's not mentioned in the book but you will find it extremely helpful a couple of weeks before your lab date just after doing all labs developed by different vendors it again tastes like a Cisco resource for a Cisco exam.HTH,"
2,"Okay, sort of boring",This book was kind of interesting in the sense that i love free stuff. But some of it was like con artist type stuff. I sign up for a lot of free things online now. Plus a lot of things in the book are outdated. I'd get more into detail but i cannot seem to find the book.
3,Good film gone bad,"You know there are problems when the director of a film removes his name. This was an ambitious film with great sets/costumes and actors. It also has a decent story. The problems, however, started when Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione shot additional explicit porno scenes and placed them throughout the film. These scenes total disrupt the flow of the film. Without these additional scenes, the film is already filled with plenty of sex, but it is handled very well. If you can get your hands on a version of this film without the porno, then I highly recommend it. Otherwise, you'll have to deal with it."
2,WITHOUT CHIP means without electronic chip that runs ink cartridge,"Maybe I'm new to this printer ink game but in my experience I get printer ink cartridges that have the electronic chip on them that allows you to insert them into a print so they start printing immediately. They do say in the title tag here WITHOUT CHIP, but I didn't pick up on it and just wanted to warn any future buyers that in order to get these to work you'll have to use razor blades and double stick tape to transfer the electronic chip to these ghetto little ink cartridges. Canon doesn't make them and I doubt they're even legal. What kind of third world company sells ink without an electronic chip. I give it an extra star for me being an idiot and not realizing that WITHOUT CHIP means without the essential printer ink cartridge electronic chip that all ink cartridges should have."
3,Don't get too excited,"Maybe its me but these days when I buy books that will make your life easier in some way . . . I am left with the sneaking suspicion that the writer doesn't really know that much more than I do about the subject.Certainly isn't a bad book and all the recommendations are good but I can definitely find them all in my brain, my friend's brain or online.If you're looking for a good general guideline for moving, its probably an okay book for you. If you're really looking to dig deep into your soul and understand the spiritual, emotional and life contemplating nature of a move, this might leave you wanting more."
4,Att: Independant Skilled movers,"I read this book one year before I immigrated to Canada from Lebanon .I found it - eventough helpful - insulting to the more intelligent reader.It has a somehow discouraging tone. It had no treatment for the case of independant movers. The section was just few things where a lot could have been said about Independant Skilled workers movers...It did not contain tricks and ideas that I was expecting...However, few things in this book were really helpful.Later, after I moved to Canada, I found that most of the fears that the book expose did not apply...maybe it helped me!But I feel that I could write a much better book now!The Winning point that makes you need to buy this book is this: This book is good reference to go back to from time to timeIt entertain your immigrant souls it helps you clear your head about few things if you are too lazy to think that about them.that is why the 4 stars."
1,DON'T BUY IT (That's One Less Thing to Move),"Having moved frequently in my life, and about to move again, I picked up this book out of curiosity -- was there something I'd been missing? Some advice that could make the task moving less of a dreaded burden and more of a joy -- or at least tolerable? 200 pages later, the answer is a resounding 'no.' All I got was a redolent heap of psycho-babble from a self-styled ""life coach"" (is there any other kind?), and a mild headache from rolling my eyes so much. Do yourself a favor; move without it."
4,"An engaging, thought-provoking journey to Vanuatu to find kava suppliers.","We're featuring this book in a section of COCONUT, the Web Guide to the Tropical World. The section is all about kava, and the author's new book comes out at a perfect time, as interest in Kava is growing rapidly all over the world.This book rambles at times, but the story of the author's encounters with a village of ni-Vanuatu people is wonderful and memorable and happily, it forms the bulk of the book.For a full review of Chris Kilham's KAVA book, check out the COCONUT website (which will be making its grand opening in August 1996) at http://www.coconut.com.---- Brian Dear, Editor of ""COCONUT&quot"
5,Kava: review,"INTERESTING! Bought it for my Kindle Fire...Recommend it for anyone to read about, and perhaps incorperateinto their lives."
1,I would give it zero stars if I could,"The title of this book is a sham and completely misleading go get people to buy it. I'm a religious person myself but when people, no matter what conviction, use underhanded tricks to sell you something, it's nothing but a con job.This book is for religious people too lazy to read the Bible and all it offers is quotes and excerpts from it. Save your money and buy the real thing."
1,Forget it!!!!,"What Women Don't Know (and Men Don't Tell You): The Unspoken Rules of Finding Lasting LoveDear Ladies!!Please trust me and don't waste money on this religious piece of crap!!!This book should be call what women don't know/God answers lol lol.The book will not answer any of your questions,because the only thing the author is talking about is God,Adam and Eve and Jesus!!"
4,Biblically based,Biblically based book hat is n easy read. Self reflective passages. Meditation moments. Great author. Have several of he books.
5,One of the BEST books I have EVER read,"The title of the book caught my eye one day when I was in a Walgreens Store near my house, and I flipped through the chapter titles and decided to purchase the book. I began reading the book right away, and couldn't believe that the price was only $6.99 - this book packs a lot of wisdom, and other books on similar topics will cost you much more, but I'd hold this book up to any similar book without hesitation - I learned a LOT. I have told ALL of my single girlfriends to go out and purchase this phenominal book. I found it life-changing, and after reading this book, there are some things I will definitely do differently when it comes to dating, and deciding whether or not someone is a suitable mate for myself.This book has been a real encouragement. Peace, Love, and Blessings, to both authors - you did a GREAT job.Pamela M."
5,Get this book,If you are looking to be in a relationship that produces Marriage this is your bookThis book shuts the church methods and makes you answer biblical truths in a modern world
1,Wow big let down.,"The first chiodos CD all's well that ends well was an amazing CD. There is not one song i did't like, although my favorite were the heavier ones. The new CD sounds like they were listening to Panic at the Disco or the new Used cd while they wrote it. Its boring and they hardley have any good break downs or heavy parts. Your best bet is to download the one good song on the CD becuase the rest of the cd is horrible. They are a great band live but if they are going to be playing this CD count me out. Listen to Bless the Fall or the Devil wears Prada. SO much better."
5,Very good.,I'm very happy with my CD as I always am with Amazon's service. I received my order very quickly and am completely satisfied. Thank you Amazon :)
3,Disappointing...,"One of my favorite things about this band was the creative keyboard parts that dominated a lot of the songs on the last album. Unfortunately, I don't really find that on this release. Many of the songs are rather mellow and my favorites are the heaviest ones. It clocks in under forty minutes which is also a disappointment. Overall, I can't say that it was a waste of my ten dollars, but at the same time the disappointments outweigh any of the good things I can say about this release."
3,Disappointing.,"I was expecting amazing things from Bone Palace Ballet. The songs they released on their myspace were, unfortunately, the only great ones on the album. ""The Undertaker's Thirst for Revenge is Unquenchable"" is, without a doubt, brilliant, and I really enjoyed ""Is It Progression if a Cannibal Uses a Fork?"" and ""Teeth the Size of Piano Keys"" (sounds like a Blood Brothers song title), but the rest of the album is...pretty average.Definitely not worth a purhcase, but it's worth a download at best.Go listen to Scary Kids Scaring Kids' new album, instead. Now THERE'S an improvement."
5,Grand Coda Indeed,"Very good album, however different it may be from ""All's Well That Ends Well."" I must admit, at first listen I wasn't too impressed and focused heavily on comparing it to their last album. This, however, is not the way to go about understanding the true value of a release.While Grand Coda may not be worth the extra cash to the casual listener, any Chiodos fan would be foolish to pass this up; The few extra tracks very much deserve a listen, and though I might not say this about albums very often, the acoustic tracks are kept interesting enough to compare to their non-acoustic partners.Considering that Amazon.com does not allow for half-star's in their reviews, I will round up from 4.5 and give this a 5."
4,Good Tunes means Good Times,"This band had a place in my heart when I heard ""The Words Bestfriend Becomes Redefined"". This is a great follow up and still has a likable standing as far as I'm concerned. The album could be a bit longer but that's up to the guys in the band and the producer. Who cares about genera, what should matter is if it sounds good! This is ranked right beside the previous album in my book. FOOD FOR THOUGHT: The Hard yet meldodic self-tile release by the USED followed by In Love and Death which was compleate opposite because Bert needed tone it down from his Throat surgeries. Maybe there is something we don't know about with Chiodos. All in all, great album and i love the head pounding bass in ""bulls make money..."" buy it and you won't be sorry."
4,From School Library Journal - 7/98,"Rather than concentraing on the origins of the Great Depression and the Stock Market Crash, this series offering focuses instead on the people of the United States and how they coped with the resultant political, social, and cultural disruptions in their lives. Nishi presents a well-crafted fusion of information, statistics, and apt quotations that have been thoughtfully selected from primary and secondary sources. The concise text is straightforward, objective, and lively. The author lets the words of the era's participants, backed-up with facts, tell the story of that turbulent time of change. Black-and-white photos, reproductions, and maps enhance the presentation. An extensive bibliography and a useful index are appended."
4,No thrills but lots of tension,"""All Quiet..."" was quite amazing. Nothing much happens except an apparent endless cycle of abuse to which the main character submits sort of gamely. All this taking place in a very simple setting somewhere in the UK which is nonetheless charming in many ways. I loved the nightly pub scenes which were not only fun in an of themselves but cruelly insightful as to the social divisions in the town. Mills' prose is fantastic for its simplicity, realism and detail and this applies both to characters and to settings. But for all its simplicity and ""unveventfullness"", ""All Quiet..."" is nonetheless quite gripping. And the power of the story becomes all that greater when we gradually realize the community as a whole and (somewhat surprisingly) the main character himself are far from innocent. Certainly not a book to be read for thrills, but rather one to be savored for building tension. I look forward to more by Magnus Mills"
2,A Protagonist Perhaps More Sinister Than His Boss,"I agree with the other reviews, but only up to a point. That point is the ending, in which the poor, put-upon kick-me-Charley sudddenly turns sinister. This raises some questions: WHY is he so acquiescent? Why has nobody ever heard of him, at the place he said he previously worked? Doesn't anyone see the connection (so to speak) between the chain in the first man's death, and the last line? I don't think I'm giving anything away when I say that this book reminds me of the movie ""BlowUp,"" though it's nowhere near as good. I gave the book only 2 stars because I think it's a little too subtle for its own good. Like people who hide Easter eggs so cleverly that no one can find them, the author is so low-key that it's hard to realize what he's getting at."
1,"Out of thousands I've read, this is the worst","I don't often take the time to review books here, but I felt it a duty to humanity to warn readers about this one. After a lifetime of reading novels--thousands of them--I've come to expect a story to begin within the first five or ten pages (and more often within the first five or ten paragraphs). In ALL QUIET ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS, no story begins within the first hundred pages, which are about a man being inveigled into doing dull, strenuous odd jobs around a camp ground. The rest of this nonstory is clearly indicated: he will continue to be inveigled into dull, strenuous odd jobs around a camp ground until the end of the book. Judging from other reviews here, many readers find a novel without story, suspense, action, or surprise--a novel in which nothing of interest happens--to be quite a refreshing change. I wish them well. Unless you're in the mood for mind-numbing boredom, however, I'd recommend staying well clear of this book."
5,Exactly what I was looking for!,"Thank you to Will Richardson for providing us with a book that is filled with practical information on blogs, wikis, podcasts, and other powerful tech tools. When I purchased my book, I found that I couldn't put it down. There were ideas that I could try immediately to helped me begin my journey of implementation. So many books only talk about theory, but this book gives you tips on what to do right now to get started on these topics. I found the book to be refreshing and exciting, and one that I reference often. Highly recommended."
3,Blogs and wikis,This item arrived a little late and was somewhat damaged. I had to cut some of the edge off because it was dirty and had damage.
4,Great ideas - helpful resource,"UPDATE 2012: Received email question about this book/review. Here iare my thoughts - this ia dceent primer for the non-tech staff, but for anyone comfortable with surfing and ffiguring things out on the go - things have developed WELL beyond the resources presented within this text (as predicted)ORIGINAL POST:As with any tech manual - things change quickly - and you have a wide-variety of audience skill levels. However, this is a great book for those who are used to dabbling about on their own.I appreciated the resource lists and ideas beyond the basics (Flickr ideas got things popping for me beyond what is mentioned in the text).I wish more time and details were spent beyond the basics of how to set up a blog, etc. but more about student application in the classroom (or out), etc."
2,First Impression: Not great,"I've done aerobic workouts of all kinds most of my life with dance aerobics being my favorite. I own most of the really good dance workouts already so I can compare easily. D's dance steps were cool and I liked learning them. But can you say,""REPETITIVE""??? After each step was added to those before, D would practise it over and over starting at step 1 EVERY TIME! She ended each section by asking her group,""Are you already gone??"" I was screaming,""YES!!! The ship has sailed, the barn door is open and the horses are gone, you name it,D, it's gone!"" I am a very patient person. I have only stopped a workout video/DVD a few times in my life! But I had to. I found myself repeating in my head, 'kill me now, kill me now!' Sorry, D, nothing personal. You're a great dancer."
2,Not was I spected,"I bought this video expecting a faster tempo-high NRG hip hop class , the class is nice and well explained , the instructor have great teaching skills , but not much energy , this is a great workout if you are a beginner , but if you're not you should search for something else ."
2,Difficult To Follow,This tape is for someone who is an experienced dancer. I just wanted something that my daughter and I could do together. She is much younger and still found it to be difficult. The moves are not repeated enough for you to get the entire routine. I definately do not recommend this one.
1,Measuring lines,"I do not recommend this product. The grids line/squares are not designatred on the entire flat plate of the cutter. So lining up paper is very difficult. If I would have realized that there was no grid lines, I would not have purchased the product."
1,Worst Blades Ever!,"This cutter works well - WHEN it works. The problem is that the blades dull out in literally no time. I have needed to use it to cut cardstock paper and at about the 30th cut - it starts to shred the paper. Overall it does a fairly straight job - but I end up going through blades like I do tissues - it really is ridiculous. And on top of the price of the cutter itself, to get 2 replacement blades it is around[...]. This cutter has not been worth it at all for me and the measurements - to add on to it - when you get between the 5 and the 6 it's almost as if it's not accurate and difficult to measure! I tried to cut an 11"" paper in half at the 5 1/2 and it is always off enough to notice. It's very odd actually. Would not recommend this."
4,Good value,"For a reasonable price, this trimmer does the job. I am not a heavy user... just use it to trim an occasional picture. I did use it to trim 1000 reply cards for a mailing that my group did. The trimmer handled the job fine."
5,"a little bigger, better...","I bought a smaller fiskars trimmer like 3 years ago and is still in good condition. I replaced with this bigger trimmer so i can cut an 8x11"" paper. i like this products."
1,"It cuts, but it gets jammed ALL of the time","Yes, the paper cutter cuts. Does it cut well? No.I use this for trimming pictures on photo paper.The little groove where the blade goes when cutting gets clogged with paper residue and makes it hard for the blade to slide. This makes for horrible, jagged-looking paper edges.This is the fourth paper cutter I own and definitely the worst one. Good thing it was cheap because I'll be pitching it soon."
4,I really like it...,"This little item works very well, as long as you put enough pressure on the blade while youre sliding it. it will trim 2 pieces of cardstock at once, and very well at that.*SIDENOTE*-I just discovered today that the cutting slider button has broken off, and I have no idea where it's at, so I guess now I already gotta replace it. Only had it around 6 months. Bummer!"
2,Save your money,"I have had this paper cutter for about 5 years. I use it for projects every few months, and it really hasn't held up to that much use. The blades aren't that sharp, and the shuttle that holds the blade is able to be angled/wiggled a little within its holder, which can easily lead to slightly crooked cuts if you're not really careful. This has been frustrating and wastes paper. The cutter is also unsuitable for scrapbookers or card makers who use 12""x12"" paper regularly, as it's only large enough for 8.5""x11"". I would recommend saving your money and purchasing a larger, better made guillotine or rotary cutter."
2,Read the screenplay instead - it has more depth,Not much to say about this novelization. It offers little beyond the screenplay and actually changes some of the most entertaining dialog.
1,Not Readable!,There are many overwrites - words printed on top of other words. Found five of these on one of the very first pages. Beware!
2,What? Is there nothing new in soap making?,"If you own Sandy Maine's books ""The Soap Book"" and ""Soothing Soaps"" do not waste your money on this one. Everything in the other two books is in this one ""word for word"". There are a few new receipes but not enough to make it worth your money to purchase this one if you already own the others. I was disappointed."
2,Anything New?,"Scanning through this book, I just wanted to let others know that it appears that Sandy Maine has just taken her first book (""The Soap Book""), added a few new ideas to it and called it a new book. All of the introduction and the body soap recipes are word for word identical. I hate it when authors do this, and find it borderline dishonest. By the way, ""The Soap Book"" is a nice little book for the price, more for the general info and photography than for the recipes, which are all variations of one theme, each of which makes too much of one type of soap, and uses way too much essential oil."
4,Good Soapmaking Book - Recommended,"""Clean, Naturally"" is a very good collection of soap and household cleaner recipes. We own a small business and have expanded into producing Bath & Body care products, so picked up this book to add to our library.This is one of the best collections of practical recipes we have found but, as others have noted, many are contained in Main's other books (Soap Book). This is not a big issue for us, but if you already own that book, you might want to pass on this one. Also, several of the the recipes use Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS), which is a serious skin irritant for many people, but for those that are concerned about SLS (like us), Sodium Coco Sulfate is considered a safer alternative.The recipes are generally easy to follow and many have color pictures to show what the finished product should look like, which is always helpful.Recommended!CFH"
5,One of the best fire app. books out there!,"This is a must have for any collection. Jam packed with lots of interesting information about Mack fire trucks. Includes chapters on each different model of fire apparatus. One mistake is that the Mack E Cab-Over-Engine featured went to Chicago Fire Department as a Squad. As a Los Angeles County Fire Department fan, there could have been more LACoFD rigs."
3,"Good for Strategy, Less fun","This game is not as high quality as it could be, all be it it's a simple game. The pieces consist of little blocks and chips, which are like the really old thin plastic poker chips. All you do is roll the die and try to get the most chips by landing on them, with the other people placing blockers hear and there to get you from reaching your goal. I guess the game is somewhat unpredictable, because anyone can land on you and take all your chips away, but it gets monotonous after a while, and the game just isn't as high quality as most. Overall it's an alright game, but if you have a lot of other high-quality games (Cranium, Monopoly, etc.) I doubt this is for you."
2,Don't Pay Full Price,"This book is so out-of-date as to be almost dangerous. Do not think that you're going to buy this book to use as a reference later. The book was written for 2.2 BW; the updates in the appendix for 3.0 are confusing, misleading, etc.The only advantage that you will get from this book are some sample test questions to get your mind working. However, some of the questions do not relate at all to 3.0; some of them have incorrect answers; I don't remember recognizing any of the questions on the test from the book.The book describes the administration of the test. This is very out-of-date in terms of number of questions, length of test, how the test is graded, etc. Don't rely at all on this part of the book.If you can't get a cheap used copy of this book, don't bother.Catherine Roze or Wiley Publishers: If you're out there listening, please revise this book. If you need help, let me know; I'm an out-of-work Certified BW Consultant. . ."
1,outdated,"I did pass the exam (Business Warehouse 2002), but not because of reading this book. Both the content and the sample questions now only have little to do with the exam content. It will be even less with the upcoming Netweaver exam. The introduction about how to prepare for the exam might make you a bit confident, but that's all. But you can also have this information for free: the BW 2002 exam is multiple choice, consists of 80 questions and takes three hours. BTW: as far as I remember, the book says 60 questions and one hour. You see, there must have happened something in the meantime."
4,Good book but does not cover everything,"Since there is no other certification book avaialable in the market, I would say this is the best available book. However, this will not cover all the certification questions. And, it is not in detail. You have to study other books."
3,National Geographic's Tigers of the Snow.,"It is a very interesting look at Siberian Tigers in Captivity,However I would have liked to have seen more Tiger Footage instead of Humans interacting with them,The saddest part would be the Mother Tiger Who did not groom or fed her Little Babies and one ended up dying,It is worth watching but it's not like the Usual Animal specials that have A Lot of Footage instead of one group or person's conservation efforts(which I applaud).I disagree that Human Greed have anything to do with it,more so Local Hunters in the area and people who are ignorant."
2,Not much!,"There was not very much footage of the tigers here. It looks like the fillmakers spent a lot of time in some town in Siberia, which is apparently a lot like white trash America. So instead of feeling taken away, I felt like I was taken back to the Ohio. Also, the scientists spend lot of time looking for tigers or avoiding seeing the tigers so they don't get eaten. And not much time actually running with the tigers.There is one really cool part about hunting tigers from a helicopter (with dart guns to put radio trackers on them.) They should make a video game out of that part.I think the whole idea of a nature documentary about one animal sounds good on paper, but it works a lot better to watch a documentary about a geographic region - you get more variety in your movie."
4,World-Class Guitar on a Christian Blues CD,"This is the best guitar work that I have ever heard on any Christian cd. The guitar work is definitely world-class, the harmonica is very good, and the vocals are certainly adequate for rock and roll/blues. I have heard other Glenn Kaiser's live music, but this is definitely his best. He starts off wailing on ""Torch"" and does not let up throughout the entire cd. I have heard his other versions of ""Do Lord"" and was somewhat unimpressed, but this version wails. His tune ""Runaway Train"" is extremely good; as good a blues train song as Clapton's version of ""Smokestack Lightning"" from ""Five Live Yardbirds"" (and that is one of my favorite blues tunes to this day). I would highly recommend this cd for any lover of Christan Rock/Blues."
2,Doc/Moc,I expected this to be either more documentary like or more theater. It didn't really meet either of those expectations. The acting was pretty bad. It did tell the story like the book did. I feel like the book is a far greater way to experience this story though.
5,One of the Best Family Show's in History,"Chris Rock and Ali Le Roi really made a hit with this show. It is authentic, genuine and hilarious all at once. Even the racial slurs that Caruso makes to Chris cracks me up. This is a show that should have continued as long as the Cosby Show. It is shame that the plugged got pulled from this show. It should've never happened. But the bright side is at least I could always own it forever on DVD. I highly recommend each and every episode of Everybody Hates Chris."
5,Brilliant Series,"One of my favorite sitcoms. The situations and the actors are great in the first and second seasons. The kid playing Chris Rock was brilliant and fit the situations well. When he grew older and taller and his voice changed in the later seasons, it wasn't so funny then."
1,displeased,"Ordered this game but could not get it to work. Could not return. I would suggest another word game, maybe Flipwords2"
3,My thoughts,Intriguing. Proves there is always hope to make your life better! Find where and with whom you belong in this world.
3,The new Tormex truing tool is better,The new Tormex diamond truing tool uses a screw feed to move the diamond across the stone while the Jet is moved using your hand as the feed. This causes a more random truing action and requires more time to get the stone absolutely round.
3,Diamond truing,This was the last tool to arrive. I had used the wheel for a week before it arrived. The plane irons and flat chisels trued the wheel. When I tried using the diamond the plane irons had already done the job.
2,sample + snapple = snample?,"Ah, the sounds of Tokyo...Wait a second, I live in Manhattan. The record consists of short &/or obscure samples presumably from Tokyo, Japan. I could gather up several dvd's worth of samples within a block of my apartment that no ambient composer could tell are not from Tokyo. Someone washing dishes?! Cool. Why couldn't the talented Mr. Stone DO Something with his sampling (ala Tetsu Inoue) instead of threading them altogether for a completely UN-evocative trip through the metropolis. Snooooooorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.....Oh, good sampling job, though; I think I'll push it on some dj friends, copyright whenever."
5,2005 is looking good for Metal,"I have been a metal head since 1972. Raised on Black Sabbath, Grand Funk,KISS and many others. I am always looking for the next fix of ""pure"" metal. I certainly never expected to get that fix so soon in the year. I am a big fan of KREATOR both live and studio. I sensed they were on to something good with VIOLENT REVOLUTION but I never get my hopes up. ENEMY OF GOD has totally surpassed my wildest expectations. I realize it is only January and that Judas Priest and Overkill are coming up soon but I can safely say that ENEMY OF GOD is going to be in my TOP 5 for 2005 if not #1. It is a brilliant peice of metal."
4,Not quite Violent Revolution,"Great album in the band's new style. Crazy fast and precise and agressive. Loads of thrashing.For some reason, ""Enemy of God"" seems to lack the continuity and use of themes that ""Violent Revolution"" had. This is still one of the best thrash albums to come out, recently. There just aren't enough bands still making straight-forward thrash like this. Its just pure agression, with an attempt at clarity and provocation and instigation. I have no idea what the message is, though.Lyrically, its pretty uninspiring. Nihilists always know all the problems of the world, and none of the solutions. So, after you finish getting out your agression by pumping iron while jamming to this album, you can go out and spread some love, because that's a solution!"
5,Olnly Five Stars,"i have to give this 5 because it's the best metal CD since the last Exodus CD (Tempo of the Damned). This CD is not as good as Violent Revolution though - i belive that one to be the best Kreator has ever put out. They seem to have just remade VR, but it was that good. If your a fan of old-school Metal this is as good as it gets."
5,another thrash classic,this cd is just filled with complete brilliantsi wish they would have started out this goodjust the combination of elements for a good thrash album are hereso i suggest if you like or love thrash metal buy this album
5,Exciting Thrash Metal!!!,"Enemy of God is a great solid effort from Kreator. This release if full of killer guitar riffs, blasting drums, its just totally kick a**! Favorite tracks are Enemy of God, Impossible Brutality, and Dystopia. This is how real thrash is done, f*** Metallica's St. Anger!!!"
5,Love this!!!,"I have bought this tamper for my De'Longhi espresso machine.I love the wooden handle and feeling of the perfect weight, not too light nor heavy."
5,Saeco Aroma,Good weight. Looks nice. Fits perfectly in a Saeco Aroma double basket but NOT in the single basket!
4,"Waugh strikes again, brilliant as usual","Basil Seal, bored with predictable london sets off to witness political revoultion in Africa, paid for by the timely theft of his mother's prize emerald brooch. An hilarious and biting satire of anyone and everything, including himself. Brilliantly morbid, In Black Mischief Waugh has definitly found his voice and once again delights his fans who take vicarious pleasure from his efforts"
4,Pretty funny,"Either literary humor hasn't changed much in 80 years or Evelyn Waugh was way ahead of his time. This was a really funny book and chock full of memorably amusing characters. There's more setting than plot and nearly all of it takes place within the Author's invented country of Azania, floating off the coast of today's Somalia. The book alternates between detailing the culture and history of the island and the dialogues between its ridiculous inhabitants.This book was one of three English-language choices in a German-run hostel somewhere in Asia. With a name like ""Black Mischief"" and a publication date of 1932 I wasn't surprised at it's politically incorrectness. Nearly every ethnicity and segment of society lives up to some sort of stereotype or another; the net effect is more misanthropic than racist (but a little more racist than some of the other reviewers seem to think).In any case it was a quick and enjoyable read."
4,yessssssssssss,"not bad i do love the info in this book wont buy another book by this guy but this book i do love what i learned from it but he milk u to buy other book from em and tht where i,m going to have to say no u greedy punk i,m not buying from you anymore"
1,"A great wallet stretcher, but that's about it....","This book was a disappointment. I have no idea how this book could garner a 5-star rating, especially when you factor in the cost. YES, there are some interesting concepts, some of which conflict with ""western"" practices. You will be beated into submission about how slow stretching is for pansies. The overall concept of this book is really nothing more than a hybrid approach, with emphasis on working the body parts only to the flexibility point that YOU really need for YOUR sport/activity. The best concept I got from the book, FLEXIBILITY WITHOUT STRENGTH IS USELESS. BOOK FORMAT: Overall layout and chapters, WEAK. The pages of text are cropped and only fill the center of the pages. Pictures are grainy and gee-zow most of them are of the most simple stretching excercises ever seen, you know, the kind you can pick up at any doctors office or gymnasium. Sorry for the bummer write-up, but I gotta tell it like it is."
2,Not what I expected.,"Basically, the book takes old information and puts in SOME new info and charges $34.95 for it! The book gives no programs or routines to follow, it just displays the exercises and doesn't give good or complete descriptions on most of the exercises shown in the book. This book is not for the experienced or for the beginner for that matter. There are better books out there that discuss flexibility in greater detail like Kurz's book's and Marco Lala's tapes. Now there are some good points of this book: It doesn't use heavy scientific jargon, like Kurz's book does. Instead, it uses modern, easy to understand language which I appreciate and also makes it very refreshing. This book also gives SOME new info that are not in the older books on stretching (such as STI's). Overall, this book has information that has been covered in other book's and at a much cheaper price. But it does give some new stretching idea's, if your looking for new ones."
2,too expensive for too little information.,"As I stated in the headline... Pavel's books, are way too expensive... When I ordered this book I was expecting a tome of several hundred pages... color photos, well described excersises. I got none of those things. I will say that Pavel's writing is humorous and never boring... but this book is certainly not worth the money. Especially since you can find most, if not all the excersises and techniques from the book online and free."
3,"Informative, but disappointing","As a biography of one of our most famous and respected Presidents, I had high expectations for this book. Given that the author had devoted 30 years of his life to studying Washington and that this was a one-volume abridgment of his original 7-volume biography, I expected more excitement.Though I learned quite a bit about George Washington the man, Freeman spends too much of the book with weekly and monthly accounts of the lengthy revolutionary war, most of which Washington and his meager army spent waiting for the British to make a move. Too little actually happened to warrant devoting so much of the book to this period.However, the description of Washington's youth and Presidential years are very well done. Overall, a decent (although dry) account of Washington's life."
4,I must say that I prefer Flexner,"Although I greatly appreciate the tremendous historical significance of Freeman's work, I have to say that I strongly prefer Flexner's 1-volume abridgement of ""Washington: The Indispensible Man"" over this one. Although I think the scholarship and scope of both are excellent, Flexner is much more readable and enjoyable in my opinion. Maybe historians would prefer Freeman, but I think most lay readers (like me) would prefer Flexner.Joseph Ellis' ""Excellency"" is also a great read, but not comprehensive enough to challenge Freeman and Flexner as the best single-volume biography of Washington. I am currently reading Ron Chernow's biography of Washington, and I think it will give Flexner a good run for his money."
3,Not as easy as Lee,"This is very interesting stuff, not as easily read as Freeman's abridged Lee. It is well researched and still classic Freeman."
1,Same as two other albums?,"While I haven't heard this particular release, the song titles and the other review make it almost certain to be the same recordings that are on both ""Small Town Blues"" and ""Groovin' Is Easy."" As the other reviewer said a little more pointedly, not the best way to appreciate the Electric Flag. ""A Long Time Comin'"" is definitely a great album, especially for Mike Bloomfield fans like myself."
3,an interesting addition to the two main albums,"Though not as essential a purchase as the two main Electric Flag albums, for fans this release offers some more studio and live performances of the band. A personal favorite is the first song, Spotlight, which features a soulful Buddy Miles vocal. The last few tracks are live performances. As stated in other reviews, the sound quality isn't top notch by any means but perhaps historical interest outweighs this for some fans."
2,Strong Premise; Poor Writing,"In Brightness Falls from the Air, Ms. Triptree has written a rich yet unsatisfactory novel. Ms. Triptree's characters are an interesting collection and the general backdrop of the novel is well staged. Yet the novel is consistently hindered by the short-sighted and outright unintelligent attitudes of the characters. As such, what might have been a sophisticated novel soon becomes tedious and trite. Ms. Triptree does provide a final, dark revelation that proves eerily satisfying -- but ultimately it is the writing, not the plot, that prevents this novel from ever taking flight."
2,An Oldtimer's lament,"From the late 1940s through the 1970s and early '80s I was a frequent reader of science fiction - hard science, soft science, whatever classification Philip K. Dick can be placed in, and the sort of fantasy-with-gestures-toward-science that Silverberg wrote in his prime. The James Tiptree stories I read and loved were pretty much in that Silverberg vein, with a hard-nosed toughness at or near the surface, or somewhat more science based but just as strong.I hadn't realized that the author's style had matured in this direction. ""Brightness Falls From The Air"" is soft fantasy. It may be 'better written' than her work from the Good Old Days, but I don't like it.I recently picked up an anthology of ""the best science fiction of 2003"", and didn't find a 'real' SF story in the bunch, or even a story that was well written. So... the problem is mine, folks. My tastes are too far out of date to be relevant."
5,very good present for sailor moon fans,I love this book. I got this book form my brother who gave it to me for a present. I love the storyline. I think the pictures are good for this story.
3,I'm a New Yorker,"I heard about this book from a friends mom, and about 2 years later, I rode in his cab and bought the book from him personally! It is a really fun book, especially for me to think that I was right there where all of those fun and crazy stories took place. Although the book is poorly written and has many grammatical and spelling errors, it's still a lot of fun. There are stories about people fighting over a seat in the taxi, a Chinese man leaving his baby in the taxi, and Mr. Da Silva even saved the marriage of an arguing couple!!!"
1,yellow stories,book is a good first attempt about writing about taxi driver experiences. the story that i found most interesting was th eone where he was robbed by the blond woman. Overall its a little tough to get through. i wouldnt really recommend to anyone but if i saw another book by him i would take a look to see if his writing skills became better.
5,Great Product,"Was pleased to find this hand wash refill on Amazon and at a great price. It was received on time and was packaged extremely well. If you haven't tried this product yet, you'll be pleased and wonder why you would use anything else. The coriander and olive is a wonderful scent."
5,The Fall of the Berlin Wall,"This book is really fascinating. William F. Buckley Jr. writes with amazing detail about the symbolism of the Berlin Wall, both its rise and ultimately, the meaning of its fall. I really found the personal stories included, of people trying to escape to West Germany, to be so powerful. Anybody who is interested in the Cold War history should read this book."
1,Worst piece of medical software I've purchased,"This textbook was a real let down. It is difficult to navigate, and I've only been able to use it when I have an open internet connection. It doesn't seem to work if remote access can't get online. E-mail to the tech support address (supplied by product documentation) was returned as undeliverable, and the internet address referenced by the recorded telephone number (there was no one available to speak to when I called the telephone number listed for tech support&#65533;you are asked to leave a ""voice mail message."") for tech support was rejected by my browser as not an active site."
4,The feel of a very good stageplay in the form of a movie,"This movie is not for everyone. There's little action and nothing special in terms of cinematography - it's a pure dialogue movie. It's got the feel of a daring stageplay that's been transformed into a movie. If you go in realizing this, then you'll be happy.Campbell Scott shows that he's got his father's acting skills as he plays a womanizer who's showing his nephew that ""Sex is all around you"" in New York. And Elizabeth Berkeley! She actually redeemed herself for Showgirls in this movie.This film is not for everyone, but still, a very good piece of film by a freshman writer/director who shows promise."
2,Maybe I just don't get it...,"Maybe I just don't get it...I found this movie to be boring and draining. It opens with a scene of C. Scott talking and smoking while he supposedly holds a rapt audience of his co-workers in his grasp. I kept expecting it to end and cut to something at least a little interesting but it kept on and on and on and...well you get the idea. The dialogue is bland and labored, and it just felt like it was trying to be TOO smart and TOO important or something. Like I said, I guess I just don't get it. The character of Roger's nephew was a bright spot, and the DVD extras are ambitious, but obviously not very entertaining if you didn't enjoy the movie. I would have to say avoid - nothing is really missed by missing this movie."
3,when your oncle wants make your sexual education !,"This movie is interesting for the confrontation between a seducer man, who seems blas√© and a teenager, romantic, pure... and when this young boy meets Jennifer Beals...She understands his sensibility...Watch it ! It's a nice story."
1,Genuinely unpleasant.,"You know how, when you watch a David Mamet movie, the dialog is brilliant--even if nobody actually talks that way in real life? Well this is a cross between a badly written Mamet movie and a Woody Allen movie, minus the humor.Whether you think this is brilliant social satire or just R-rated T&A, there's nothing really clever or insightful and its ultimately pointless. So what if the acting is good. Miserable people doing miserable things. Now that's what I call entertainment!"
1,Better name...Oral Roger,"If you want to get irritated by listening to someone that can't stop talking about his own empty opinions, then this movie is for you...."
1,camera shake...,"I thought from the description that this could be an interesting film and gave it a shot. It was terrible. First because of the camera shake, I don't know about you but I can't sit trough a film with continuous camera shaking. Needless to say I didn't make it through the whole film, but from what I saw the main actor was irritating to watch."
4,Say What?,"Great dialogue and perfect casting made this film work so well. ""Roger Dodger"" made me realize that in our ADD-plagued world, people don't listen very well. What a shame, though a sharp tongue can be your downfall along with the habit of botching the dreams of others. Lots going on here and a clever resolution at the end is unexpectedly welcome-nearly perfect.Michael Durankowww.bootism.com"
2,typical one dimensional album,"Bland, unimpressive, and an insult to Russell's talent. One does not need to have harsh vocals to be dark. Cmon SX...dont fall into cliches!The title track, Paradise Lost, is by far the best song on the album and easily one of SX's best. This is how Russel shines! Its the only reason I gave the album 2 stars."
2,Dream Theater type sound,I will admit that I did not listen to this record past the third cut. The over all effect was like the band was a lame version of Dream Theater. The musicianship is excellent... just not particularly original. 2 out of 5 stars.
2,Killed by the vocals,"There are so many promising metal bands out there with good drumming and good riffs, and then some lame hack starts singing. No exception here. I must have listened to 20 new prog metal bands in the last few months and they all start out promising, and then the vocals kick in. The high wailing opera guys suck. The gritty barking guys suck. The stupid trying-to-sound-scary screaming and growling guys suck too. To ALL of you young metal bands out there, see that guy in the middle posing and belching some lame love/death/mystic/childhood b.s. trite and tired lyrics into the mic? Fire him. Go instrumental. Seriously."
2,you can save hundreds of dollars by switching to geico!,"huh? whats all the screaming about? 5 years, maybe he had throat surgery? i dunno, good music,bad vocals(not on all tho).certinly not Kamelot stature."
5,Album of the Year,"By far, this is my Album of the Year. It is absolutely brilliant! Disregard any negative press. The music is flawless. I highly recommend it. If you get the chance see them live."
2,Not Symphony X's best.,"After listening to Symphony X's great albums like The Odyssey, Mythology Suite and Divine Wings of Tragedy this album stands out to me as a dud. X has switched to a more raw metal sound in this album, dropping some of its prog-ish goodness. Granted there still is some prog in there, but not as much as I'm used to. The guitar playing is still fantastic on the album(duh its Romeo), but lyrics are too dark for my taste, and Russell's singing isnt as pure and awesome as it is in the other Symphony X albums. You might want to pass on this one."
5,Synphony X goes to Hell!!!!!,"Wow, this is powerful stuff. This album is perhaps the band's second best after V. Is solid, fast, articulate and intelligent. The guys took ther time to craft a majestic and dark masterpiece. Not many people can take a book and turn it into a great album, but the have done it twice( the Odyssey was the first). The only thing I do not like is...well...the overall theme. As a Christian I do not like stuff relating to satan or demons, not because of fear but because I find that bunch of losers deserve no air time at all. But since this is based on Milton's poem Paradise Lost, and I know the details of the author's life I can understand the whole concept. This is a great metal album. I just hope the guys will go lighter next time, how about the Illiad, or some 20,000 leagues under the Sea for the next album? Only Michael Romeo could simulate a giant squid attack with an electric guitar!!!"
5,Rock-n-Roll,"This was my first Symphony X album but it's not likely to be my last. Paradise Lost hit the spot, with a core ""old school"" Metal style with enough zigs & zags to keep it interesting. This would be a good stepping stone for anyone wanting to get a feel for Prog-Metal but not wanting to take a big plunge into it. Paradise Lost will give you a feel for the genre but not enough to turn you off if you decided it might not be your cup of tea. Symphony X dressed this album up with some nice melodies, killer crunching and lead guitar solos. So if you are like me and wonder if today's bands forgot how to play guitar you will thoroughly enjoy Paradise Lost. If you want an album that isn't one speed fits all, you can play from beginning to end and not get tired of it, then Paradise Lost is an album you should add to your collection."
3,'paradise lost',"aside from the good drumming, guitar playing, and nice vocals, the songs are fairly mediocre. the instrumental intro was great though. but, the lyrics are bland and hardly go with the illustrations. maybe a more collaborative effort would have worked better. but, the CD has good packaging..."
3,What a Bummer,"Big letdown from this great band. Like ketchup pouring out of a bottle, I waited with eager anticipation for the release of this CD. However, the final product was just ordinary- some nice moments here, some good playing. But, overall this has to be the biggest disappointment of the summer of 2007. Don't listen to the super fans. This is a weak CD lacking any memorable songs. I love this band, so it pains me to write this. I am even going to go as far as saying that I hate the way Allen sings on this CD and he is one of my favorites. Oh well, I hope their next effort is a lot better. Sorry if I made you mad super fans...but I am a super fan also...I'm just an honest one."
3,5 YEARS FOR THIS ?? WHAT A LETDOWN,"After all these years, this is what we get ..Ive listened to this cd countless times since its release and really nothing truly stands out . its just kind of dull... 2 decent tracks but the rest of the cd has no flow and zero symphonic overtones. not sure what's next? they need to go back and go over what got them a fanbase . truly there weakest cd since "" The Damnation Game"" I mean If I want to listen to Pantera I would.... C'mon Guys , your better than this!!!!"
2,addendum,"This book is shrinkwrapped with the words ""No Return If This Is Opened"". In other words if you look at the book you can't return it. That should have been my first warning. I have ordered a lot of books on Amazon and this was the first time I encountered that."
3,"Yes, it's a good book but let's not kid our selves","I enjoyed reading this book. filled with mysterios things but lets not kid ourselves it's not 5 star material here. It's neet though what it ends up being (I cant give it away.) but the stary is neet. however it is one of those plots that's always there, one that you can be expecting. something threatens the enterprize and everyone thats on it."
2,Too fast and distracting,"The graphics they put on this to make it look ""cool"" are distracting and annoying. The dances are all too fast for kids to keep up and the stretching part is only 5 minutes long. Not worth the money!"
5,Wool Boot Socks,"100% virgin wool. What other type of socks will keep your feet as warm,even if they happen to get wet. Wool breaths and is very durable."
1,Died before the 1st year was out,"Last September I decided that, after almost 30 years with my old Zenith digital alarm clock, it was time for me to get a new clock. I chose the Timex MP3/cd line-in alarm clock. It is somewhat confusing to use. There were a couple of times when it didn't perform as I thought I'd set it to, and I don't know if I did something wrong or it was malfunctioning. The performance and features of it are, however, decidedly secondary to the fact that it's now dead. I woke up, over an hour late, this morning to see a random pattern of lines displayed across the face. Regardless of the buttons I pushed there was no response or change. I unplugged it before I left and plugged it back in when I got home hoping for some sort of revival, but I was disappointed. I'm really pissed off, and all I can do is write this review. I really wish I kept the old Zenith; somehow I think it would be working today."
1,unsoothing noises,"I bought this clock to hear nice soothing background sounds while I sleep,which I believe is the purpose of the clock. NONE of the sound choices are soothing or helpful in sleeping (ie: ""Wind"" sound had chimes in it,""Brook"" had noisy birds);It is definitely NOT a sleeping aide!"
3,Similar to the ones I see in Hilton hotels,"A little disappointed that it doesn't have radio; it's my fault not reading the description correctly. Otherwise, it works fine."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CLOCK AT ANY PRICE,"After 100 years of digital alarm clocks being available in the market, setting an alarm should not be an issue. In this clock it is. Save yourself some money and lots of trouble."
2,Does not play CD's well,"The alarm clock was adequate, the line in is a nice feature, but what's the point of a CD player that skips when playing CD's? At first I thought the CD was damaged, but it played fine on my other equipment. I have to conclude that it's not a good idea to purchase a player that holds the CD vertically rather than horizontally. I cannot recommend this item."
3,"Good book, easily destroyed","The concept is great, anything to help us brush the little ones teeth. For some reason I thought this was one of the books with thick pages that can stand up to the kids. It is not. Has thin pages that are destroyed in no time."
4,Complete Yoga Book,The book is informative and contains practically everything needed for anyone who is interested in beginning yoga.
1,This item is worse than any of the reviews!,"Yes I must admit that my daughter loves the car, but it is a really really low quality car. I don't think anyone reading the reviews would imagine how low the quality is. Yeah it costs almost $25 but it is probably worse $5.Find another car for your child. It is nt worth the money AT ALL!"
5,enjoy real life crime stories,The book was well written. Looking forward to reading other books she has written. if anyone enjoys true crime stories this is one you shouldnt miss.
1,Not enough info to warrant a bio,"Since Nick Drake didn't talk much, there just isn't enough info to sustain an enaging text. Worse, the author spends little time trying to glean meaning from the only real record we have of Drake's innermost thoughts: his lyrics and music. Instead, you have a scattered and ultimately insightless bio on a figure that will continue to remain a mystery."
2,I love him but ...,"I have found most biographies will give some insight into an artist/person's reason, background, or basis for their work(s). This book, whilst interesting and as factual as he can make it, infuriatingly, only makes Nick Drake the man of mystery) more enigmatic and puzzling.If you are looking for the man behind the cult, give up now; we will never know, understand, or fathom how he was able to receive a recording contract (for three albums), let alone what spurred him on to create these monumental albums."
2,I love him but ...,"I have found most biographies will give some insight into an artist/person's reason, background, or basis for their work(s). This book, whilst interesting and as factual as he can make it, infuriatingly, only makes Nick Drake the man of mystery) more enigmatic and puzzling.If you are looking for the man behind the cult, give up now; we will never know, understand, or fathom"
2,Too much fluff,"As the other reviewers have said, there is too much useless information. He should have given in to this and made a concise, quick read, but instead seemed to set a page number goal and filled most of it with fluff."
3,some good stuff but it over extended itself,"I read the book roughly and got a great idea on the life of I believe to be a genuis, Nick Drake. While I was reading it however I noticed an alarming trend. The stories center seems to be focused on Nick Drakes depression. Now I do sympathize with Nick on his illness but the book is drowning in self-pity for him. Every other page described how bad Nicks depression was and they would elaborate it and attack it at different angles. Not necessary. It definately detracted from the experience which was kinda cozy until it wallowed in depression repitition. However the book has enough shine to it so its worth reading if you like Nick Drake. Just dont read it when your depressed."
1,Code Name Stinkbomb,"Kathleen Kinmont is awful in every way, but there's a whole lot of bad acting to go around here, including of course O.J. Simpson. There is no possible way to believe that Kinmont and the kid have any relationship, much less mother-daughter. The special effects are hilarious, though. I love the way the bodyguard creeping through the utility passageway suddenly turns into a stunt man being blown off a ledge, while magically reversing direction in mid-air! They must have loved that special effect, because they used it for two different deaths! What a joke. I only bought the DVD because my late friend Bil Barratt played the bodyguard who got blown up. Otherwise it wouldn't even be worth the $2.50 I paid."
2,Details on CONGRESS VIDEO's 1989 version of Dead of Night,"There are TWO videotapes available of DEAD OF NIGHT (1945). One is a 1998 REPUBLIC release, the other a 1989 CONGRESS VIDEO edition. Comments here (and the star rating) are specific only to that second tape.This is of the very poorest quality! Recorded in ELP speed, it has a terribly degraded picture that looks multi-generational and a linear audio track, meaning NON-HiFi. Even the sound is bad. There's a faint background squeal and the spoken word is partially garbled.Definitely avoid the 1989 CONGRESS VIDEO release of this otherwise SUPERB movie.(PS to DEAD OF NIGHT fans: Sorry for the two stars, but with 28 current reviews on this film I don't think the overall rating will be dragged down at all because of it. The tape in question is so AWFUL, there was little else to be done, IMO.)"
3,tiresome,"the idea of the movie was good, but halfway through it i got really bored, especially the golfing segment. it was an alright movie for its time and the ending was good."
4,Very engrossing,"Terrific entertainment, though I have to reluctantly admit that I was just a little bit disappointed...though I suppose that's inevitable when you hear so much about a film before actually getting to see it. One point I'd really like to make, specially considering I've never heard it referred to before: isn't it remarkable how the ending of the ventriloquist segment seems to point forward to the closing scenes of 'Psycho'? - what with Michael Redgrave, completely possessed by his dummy, grinning maniacally at the viewer (complete with voiceover) and the psychiatrist's explanation (""the dummy side of his personality took over..."" instead of the ""mummy"" side!) For that matter, even the coachman of the hearse looked a little bit like Hitchcock!"
2,outdated bore,"Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of creepy black and white horror movies, but this 'horror' anthology looses its appeal at the very beginning. I usually don't think movie remakes are a good idea, but using the outline of this movie (dummy that comes to life, living out a dream) in a more modern day setting would probably be pretty good. Dead of Night attempts to be atmospheric and ends up just being..dead.."
2,Probably Good at the Time...,"I watched this movie on the recommendation of a friend. I don't want to say that I was misled, but the movie is just a little too old to be enjoyable compared to movies with today's standards -- poor acting, very corny."
5,"Horror Anthology before Hitchcock, Twilight Zone or Thriller.","If your a fan of the great horror anthology shows of the50's, 60's and 70's you will love this. This is the originaland very best. The stories are incredible and the movie is ahorror mystery classic gem! Why this doesn't get the creditit deserves. It's well made and acted. The quality is notperfect but very good but I like the old look to these typeof films. Don't let the cover fool you it's not some cheesybat monster movie! It reminds me of the Thriller tv serieswith Boris Karloff. A lost gem in this genre."
1,Sad News for Classic Movie Buffs,"This ""CV"" version, alas and alack, is the same one being sold on the website of a well-loved three-letter cable network whose genial host, Robert Osborne, introduces most of the films. However, same network shows this gem from time to time, so one might be just as well off making a home copy next time it airs.Sad, sad, sad."
1,"Great movie, horrible video","I agree with a previous reviewer- this is a wonderful movie, one I had waited to buy for years. This particular taped print is unwatchable- both sound and video are bad. Don't waste your money on this print, please! I returned one copy and got another, and it was just as bad. Avoid this version by ""Congress Video Group"" and pray that someday someone puts out a watchable version."
2,"Review of DVD quality of ""Dead of Night""","This represents a very poor transfer from film to DVD. Both image and sound are very poor. I have seen ""Dead of Night"" broadcast on movie channels with much better quality. If you can sell a high quality or restored version of this film, I would be happy to pay a higher price for it. This copy is definitely a cheat at any price!"
2,"Great film, horrible video quality!","Our anonymous reviewer from California is 100% on the money when he says that the ""this particular taped print is unwatchable."" I also had his experience of ordering twice and both of them were equally bad. It's a great film and I'm encouraged to see that it's now out on DVD. If you love the genre, you might want to fork over the 22 bucks for it. But DON'T spend the 10 on the VHS version ... you'll be sorry!"
2,Great film in a bad tape,"The film is worth 5 stars, but this VHS tape doesn't do it justice. The video and audio transfers are made from a very deteriorated source. I've seen a much better transfer from a PBS TV broadcast. Much of this landmark horror film's effectiveness comes from its great black-and-white photography and this tape is a poor presentation of that. And the price tag tells all.I was going to review how great this film is, what's the use if this tape cannot possibly present to you the greatness of this film?Has any of the reviewers before me actually bought this tape and seen it?"
1,"Great Film, Horrible Quality","Each episode of this masterpiece conveys a sense of dread and impending horror. This is achieved by gradually turning reality askew until it's a nightmare. No need for chainsaws and chop-chop. Unfortunately, the print I received must have been pirated by a drunken one-armed lodger with Parkinson's Disease, sitting in a vibrating chair in a dumpy London flat while struggling to keep his Toys R Us video camera trained on the flickering blue screen of a 10-inch Dumont TV situated behind the dirty window of an apartment on the other side of the Thames during a foggy night."
3,Great movie/Bad DVD,"Dead of Night is a terrific film. The DVD I received, however, would not play properly. It skipped, had odd artifacts and would randomly stop at times. Therefore I had to return it for a refund. The picture quality was also poor. It's an old movie and is very difficult to find a good print."
1,Almost unwatchable video transfer,"Dead of Night is a wonderful movie, however, this video transfer is literally almost unwatchable. At times I had difficulty distinguishing one actor from another because they were so out of focus. The sound quality was equally dismal.As much as I really enjoy this fim, I can not recommend purchasing this video edition. Wait for it to be shown on TV or for a better transfer to be made to video."
3,Good Scandinavian mystery,"The Princess of Burundi by Kjell Eriksson is an interesting and well-plotted mystery featuring Swedish detectives Ann Lindell and Ola Haver. They work together to solve the mystery of who tortured and murdered John Harald Jonsson, an out of work welder and tropical fish enthusiast. As like many other Scandinavian mysteries, the atmosphere of the country and thoughts of the characters are as important as any action. I like this style but felt this novel lost momentum part way through. However, the writing was eloquent and story was good, so I will undoubtedly pick up the next book in the series."
2,The Princess of Burundi,"I could not get interested in this book. I read 40 pages or so and finally gave up. I found the characters uninteresting. I had no feelings for any of them, not even sympathy for the widow and son of the murdered man John. The winter landscape was depressing but that may have not been a problem if the story had been better.From the editorial reviews this sounded like the perfect book for me. I'm not giving up though. I'm going to try reading it again in a few months and hopefully my opinion will change."
2,Overrated,"Although the writing in this book is good and even very good in parts--ultimately it is a loser for three reason: 1)totally unsympathic and self-centered feminist lead detective; 2)periodic intrusion of author's obnoxious leftist politics; and 3)nonsensical actions by characters, ie person thinking he would be arrested for murder and accidently killing himself trying to escape when he clearly acted in defense of others. There's much better crime fiction from Sweden; read it."
3,A mystery the author couldn't solve,"An intricate story full of character development and reflections on Swedish life. Interspersed we see a murder, an assault, and a few other crimes, and a police team going about the often tedious work of investigators. This is not a book for fans of the slam-bam detective book. Unfortunately, the first 80% of the book has nothing to do with the ending solution to the crimes committed. It's as if the author couldn't decide who among the herd of suspects should be tabbed as the bad person and gave up on any of them."
5,"Emotional, Mysterious Swedish Police Procedural","The Princess of Burundi is not only unique in it's title but also in its emotional content. Uppsala police detectives are involved in solving the murder of John Jonsson, an expert in tropical fish and fish aquariums and former thug. The story unfolds with the secrets father and son kept from John's wife and it is also a few days before Christmas which adds to the longing and loneliness of the holidays. Princess is an excelent 87th-Precinct-like novel. The cultural differences are fascinating. Highly recommended."
3,Slow paced Swedish detective procedural,"I found this detective novel to be boring, and I quit reading it twice when I was loaned much more interesting books. I really liked the Henning Mankell and Steig Larsson novels and have read all of them. If this series is as plodding as this book is, I will not read any more of them. I do keep this one at my bedside, five to ten pages of it puts me to sleep every time. I may never get it finished."
3,100 Pages Too Long,"I too was disappointed in the novel. I like Scandinavian mysteries: the darkness of the sky and of the soul. I like Ed McBain, too. This ain't them. This novel is like a bland version of your favorite Chinese entree. The murder is interesting, the intro is promising, then it goes ""off"" for about 100 pages. The shift of view from one member of the force to another is badly paced. The lack of evidence bores rather than involves us in the police's frustration. The female police officer is a yawn. True, the book picks up in the last few chapters, but that almost feels like punishment: you have to keep reading."
2,Fairly pedestrian scandinavian crime novel,"My wife and I read this after becoming hooked on the Scandinavian crime scene, mainly through Larsson and Mankell. The Princess of Burundi shares the bleak landscape and social themes of the Wallander series and the Salander books, but little else. The plot is uninteresting and so are the characters, who mostly walk around complaining about their boring lives. The detectives do very little investigating, or much else for that matter. This might be what you get when a mediocre writer attempts a Bergmanesque thriller and fails miserably."
1,Disappointing Read,"I have read many crime novels from Sweden, Norway and Denmark in the last two years. Some have been well-written with interesting characters and clever plots. This novel I found very disappointing in all respects. I could not get interested in, nor develop any sympathy for, the main characters. I abandobouts easing it about halfway through. I considered reading the last few pages to see who did what to whom. Frankly, I no longer cared. Other reviewers enjoyed it, so it might just be my taste. I have another novel by this writer waiting to be read. I hope it's better than 'The Princess of Burundi'."
2,A Disappointment,"While the subject matter of this book is potentially facinating, this book has problems. First of all, it is shockingly poorly edited. Second, the author can't quite decide to take a detached view of the material or to be lighthearted. One way or the other might not be that bad, but both is annoying. For a better, more in-depth treatment of this subject, I recommend Nicholas Campion's ""The Great Year""."
2,The sensational idea that the world will End - It may not.,The book's point gets lost from chapter to chapter when it provides detailed accounts of fundamentalist Christians in US history who ruled by fear that The End was coming. There aren't many prophecies in the book and basic prescribed methods of preparation for the end. Some Hindu and Muslim mythology is incorrect due to the lack of core understanding. It mainly focuses on the freaks in the US with little information about the rest of the world. The overlapping predictions of some of the New Age psychics are a bit redundant. Read this if you are in the mood to skim - it is the only way one can see the last pages. It seems like a basic stepping stone that could lead to better reading if the subject matter is of interest to the reader.
1,does NOT fit!,this filter DOES NOT FIT HYUNDAI TIBURON GT! so don't bother. you need the one that goes into a fuel pump!
4,acupressure teckniques,a weath of information for those of you who want to learn more on the acupressure point. very helpful for my class. The book arrived in outstanding condition for the money. Thanks so very much Amazon.
3,only work on a very smooth floor,"We bought this toy a year back and at that time, we only had carpet in our apartment. Other than making some noise and flash light, the tractor cannot move at all. After we moved to an apartment with hard and smooth floor, my son started to show interest in it. He's 1.5 years old now. However, my 3-year-old daughter never shows any interest in it."
4,Nice and fun but....,"The kids love this toy, however it was so hard to get out of the packaging! There is a little plastic piece that should come off easily so that the little man can sit in the tractor but we couldnt get it off! We had to use a special screw driver to get it off so that the toy would work. They need to get a different system."
4,Large focus on meditation and breathing.,"Was expecting more on diet and supplements, but found there was a huge emphasis on exercise and specifically meditation and yoga. Lots of techniques and explanation as to how to meditate and use breathing exercises to relieve stress. The feeling from the authors is that stress is a key contributor to PMS symptoms, which I'm not sure is the case. I'm unclear as to whether stress aggrevates the symptoms or whether your experiencing these symptoms makes it less likely that you can deal with stress as you normally would. I haven't been practicing the techniques so I don't know if they are helpful although I do exercise 3-4 times a week and although it does help while I'm exercising, it does not help later when I'm not and I experience stess.So, if you feel that you can fit the exercise component into your life this is a good book, otherwise, look elsewhere."
4,So many pieces!!!,Hard to assemble but very cute once you get it put together. Works great in my 3 and 5 year olds' rooms!!!
1,Not Good !!!!!,"I purchased this product and 3 months after the warranty ran out, the retracting spring just let go and now it won't roll back up. I probably wouldn't have written this except that in the last 15 months, I have used it less than 12 times !!!!! Buyer Beware."
1,Piece of Crap,"Purchased this reel for occasional use in a pole barn. We hung it from the ceiling. After about the 10th pull over a 6 month period, the internal plastic broke. We took the cover off of it to see if it could be repaired. Everything except for the sring is plastic. The spring pulled loose out of the plastic mount. The internals are plastic welded so it is can not be serviced. Basically I spent over $[...] on an extension cord I could have purchased for $[...]. The label on the reel cover stated for light duty use only. It should have said not for actual use."
2,wont retract,"Bought this ""automatic"" reel for my truck so I wouldn't have to manually roll up my cord, not the case. This will only roll up about 2/3's of the cord and the rest you have to push in yourself. Do not recommend this product."
2,Returned item,"My son changed mind about this costume, wound up returning it. The mask was VERY tight and uncomfortable......but you get what you pay for, right?"
3,Just OK,"As in most cases qith customs, this one looks a lot nicer on the picure than in person. It is not finished well with a true waist band, and the accessories are cheap and ""plastiky""."
4,Bright and colorful ! Only for those who are into Thomas!,"If you have a child who is into Thomas and Friends - then I would answer ""yes"" in regards to purchasing this item. You need to beware that the quality of the material is not up to standard. They are thin and itchy when you take them out of the package. Had to wash them and use rinse softener plus the dryer sheets to get them softer. Yet, it will take more than one washing.Yet after the washing, the colors remain intake very well. After washing, my son doesn't mind the sheets. He just wants to sleep with Thomas and/or James who is his favorite engine."
3,Good for the price,The sheets are cute and bright! My son loves them and I like that they are soft. I was expecting them to be crispy!
2,Rather unappealing protagonist,"I think I would have enjoyed this book more if Susan Henshaw were a little more appealing. Is it me, or is she the most self-centered creature on the face of the earth? Or maybe she's supposed to be one of those people you love to hate, and I'm missing something. I keep looking for her to redeem herself with either some razor-sharp wit or deep insight, but I'm still waiting. Disappointing book."
4,Chrissy's getting married and one of her gifts is a corpse,"Susan is trying to give her daughter the perfect wedding. In addition to the usual stress, her daughter's dress has not arrived from Italy and her future son in law's parents have invited all of their former commune buddies to a rehearsal dinner intended only for the family. The usual stresses of family only add to the fun. When the dress finally arrives, Susan goes to pick it up only to find the body of a strange woman with a wedding invitation inside the otherwise empty box. How can she give the perfect wedding in a crime scene?This is one of Ms. Wolzien's better efforts. Her grasp of the details of a large wedding and descriptions of the crazy commune members are wonderful. I really enjoyed the many intertwined plotlines, and the crazy characters really kept me laughing."
3,"Cute, but not a whole lot of substance","Susan's daughter Chrissy is getting married, but when Susan tries to find the wedding dress, she finds the box, and there's a woman's dead body in the box. In a desperate fit to keep the wedding from being ruined, Susan and her friend Kathleen hide the body in various places planning to tell the local police when the wedding's over. Valerie Wolzien has pretty much staked out suburban Connecticut as her place of mystery, and usually, she can be counted on to provide a good mystery and some fun along the way. The problem I had with this book is that Susan seemed to be acting out of character with respect to the law and the process of investigation of a murder. However, having seen my own mother go crazy when my sister got married, I should probably be less harsh. Still, I enjoyed reading this, and as long as you don't take it too seriously, it's a light fun book."
3,Ho-Hum....,"I ordered this mistakenly thinking it was a cookbook for one- but it is not bad, but not great. A very rudamentary cook book. Be advised the ""low fat"" recipes are scattered throught (and highlighted), so not all are 'heart healthy'....(one has mayo as the main ingredient). With all the other cookbooks out there, I would recommend 365 Easy One-Dish Meals by Marie Haughton and Natalie H. Haughton...much better layout.... I don't think the paperback spine layout of this book made it easy in the kitchen....nor did it list ingredients well (don't tell me ""1 cup of milk"" and then in another part of the recipe tell me about ANOTHER ""1/2 cup of milk"".I will keep this cookbook as a reference, but not as a day to day....many of the recipes I have seen elsewhere, and easier to use/read/reference.... Save your time and hassle- go buy 365 Easy One-Dish Meals (not trying to plug it, just like it so much better...)"
3,Nobodys fault I just dont like book,"I chose rating because book just doesn't grab me. I didn't like hardly any of recipes in fact none. I would recommend this book to someone that doesn't cook often, maybe."
3,"Lovely, but ...","This is a gorgeous watch ... exactly what I was looking for. However, it does not work. I presume it's the battery, but how would I know? Reluctantly, it goes back."
4,Wix Air Filter 46887,The wix air filter was purchased by me. I then took out the old and put in the new. no worries or hassles. So far its working good.Biggie Smalls
5,Great Pokemon Book,"This book rocks. If you like Pokemon you'll love this book. ""Pikachu Shocks Back"" continues the story of young Ash Ketchum's journey to become a Pokemon master. He is accompanied by Brock and Misty and of course the adorable Pikachu. This book starts off with the challenging Pokemon race. It also includes the first appearence of team rocket in the manga.There is Pikachus excellent adventure, the Evee brothers,and also Ashes hard decision of whether or not to let Pikachu go into the wild."
1,Defective DVD,"This was a multiple DVD set and upon the first time it was played, the 2nd DVD started freeze framing when it was 3/4 way through the movie."
4,Timeless Classic,If you are a baby boomer you probably saw this when you were a kid. It still holds up as a classic feel good movie. Of course the star is the dog and the dog's acting is impeccable.
5,"That was then, this is now","And I love this movie now as much as I did back then! Wonderful cast, wonderful acting, and awesome-beyond-compare plot. You just don't get good movies about dogs nowadays. This is a classic."
3,Wonderful movie deserving Blu ray restoration,"I bought this Warners DVD and although it is great to have such a wonderful movie, it is sad to have to watch it in such compromised quality. This title really does deserve restoration and transfer to Blu ray, alongside other wonderful childrens' titles such as National Velvet, Captains Courageous and the 1949 classic 'The Secret Garden' with Margaret O'Brien.The two companion titles on this three-movie pack are excellent too (especially because of the special presence of the young British actress Elizabeth Taylor) but the original 'Lassie Come Home' is hard to beat for its verity and its unashamed pathos which never ever descends to bathos."
3,A teacher's perspective,"The textbook writing is simple but meanders enough to lose focus. The busy student could benefit from the many tables and figures, but somehow the link between text and graphics is lost in the voluminous chapters.The summaries are point like renditions of the text and do not highlight important material. Likewise the comprehensive self-test questions are not graded according to importance and carry no link back to the text.Overall, a comprehensive textbook, but lacking the focus and layout for easy adoption and study."
3,Good Introduction to Microbiology,"This book is well written (apart from a few minor typo's). It uses a lot of real life examples to help you understand how useful some microorganisms are, as well as how harmful others can be. It starts right at the beginning and steadily introduces new topics that carry on logically from previous ones. It doesn't bombard you with a lot of new words all at once either.The illustrations have been carefully thought out to make it easier to understand more complex processes. So, overall this is a good book for those who have not studied microbiology before. Although the book is written with the presumption that the reader does have some basic knowledge of biology. If you have not studied biology for a while though, don't worry all the important information necessary is also reviewed in the book."
1,I did not even purchase this book from this person and it was sent to me by mistake I ordered another book from wich was correct,This book was sent to me in a mistake. I never ordered this book from this individual. Honestly I do not know how this mix up was caused. I am not responsible from other peoples mistakes or the mistake of your services. I do not denie buying a book from him because I did but not the Micro-Biology book.I would like to speak to some one verbally over the phone so that this can be risolved and at no expense to me. Because I did not order this book. I would like to be reemberst for the money spent to send this product back.
5,Schocken Book of Modern Sephardic Literature,"Wonderful in all respects. Received promptly, execellent quality, wonderful material."
1,Sounds impressive but doesn't live up to the hype,"I purchased this to keep our shredded beef and chicken warm for a dinner party. It sounded so great....keep food warm with controlled heat. Sadly, it has not heat. The unit doesn't even warm to the touch on high. We exchanged the unit for a 2nd one and it too had the same problem. Both were defective. We ended up using Rival Crock Pots with much better results. I would not recommend this product, especially for the price"
4,Terrific item,"This holiday we wound up hosting more parties than I would have thought possible, so my husband and I purchased this item and the similar Deni 3-section server. Both trays were great at keeping food warm, and more than one guest swore they were going to rush off and buy them as well. They clean up easily and were the hits of the party. My one complaint is that on the temperature dial, the ""off"" setting does not work. The only way to turn the unit off is to unplug it from the wall. (It seems to work fine on the 3-tray unit so it's apparently a fluke.) Still, I'm not the type to leave heating appliances plugged in when not in use to begin with, so I'm not overly concerned. You probably shouldn't leave these running unattended in the first place. Fabulous purchases and highly recommended."
2,Not a very useful book,"The number of examples in this book that don't work in one browser or another is astonishing. While this is in the nature of html, it makes the book rather useless for development of an internet site. For development of an INTRAnet set, where MS Explorer can be enforced, it's not bad. Better proof-reading of the CD that contains the examples would have been helpful. Some of the scripts needed editing to enable them to conform to the filenames on the disk."
2,You can find better!,"As I bought this book knowing zero about D-HTML, it was a decent introduction, but became increasingly frustrating as I began to understand how D-HTML works. The major problem (aside from some code snippets not working) is that examples for effects are presented for either MSIE only or for Netscape only. Very seldom is code shown that will work for both. As a web developer, developong for only 1 browser is not an option! This book is great if ALL you'll develop for is MSIE -- but if you want compatability with Netscape, buy another book!"
3,The fun and easy way to start,"And now you may think that programs that do it all for you would be easier to start with. However if you do not have a basic idea of how Dynamic HTML works you will not be able to answer the questions on what to do. This book goes from the fundamentals to building a practical website. Unfortunately it does not show how to mail ""form"" information back to you from the website. There are a lot of practical examples but this book is somewhat dated. The book is also geared to Apache server and UNIX concepts therefore it should work on 90 percent of the web sites that you encounter. The code is also more transportable because of this.You need to check with your potential I.S.P. to see if they're using Internet information services (ISS) if so this book may be of little use because it is proprietary and uses a weird syntax."
4,Dynamic HTML,"Well, when I read this book I found that you really need to know HTML and Javascript. Back then I had no idea what Javascript was and I wasn't very good with HTML. Even though I didn't understand most of it (I was only 11) I still enjoyed the Humor that Michael Hyman put into this book. I now love making the money with DHTML, CGI, HTML, Java, Javascript, VB and more..... Buy this book if you now HTML well and can Scrap up a script in Javascript. Get this book."
2,"Interesting premise, so-so delivery","The premise of this book - 12 short stories with surprise endings - lead me to purchase the book about two years ago. It's taken me two years to get through it. Oh, each story passes quickly enough, but never seemed to whet my appetite to read the next story. Too bad"
3,Twelve Red Herrings,"Jeffery Archer is a master of his craft. I'm read many of his books and I must say this has been my least favourite. It a collection of 12 very short stories, which is probly where my problem lies. Mind you, the stories are good...if you like short stories."
4,O. Henry endings entertain,"Archer delivers twelve short stories, each with a different conundrum. Nine of the stories are based on real-life incidents; three are pure fiction. Each story has a decidedly O.Henry ending. (The last one has four options!) For the most part, this is a good read. It won't change your life. But, it should entertain you!"
3,Total Time Pass!,Its entertaining but there was something lacking...One would expect more out of an exceptional novelist like Archer...Its not one of his best works but if you have some free time this novel is not all that bad!
2,Wannabe,"Ignore the brown-nosing reviews on the back cover, many of which lifted from the British right-wing press. This is amateur storytelling, at best, with watery plots and weak -- sometimes embarrassing -- choices of phrase. When it comes to scorpion tales, Mr Archer, I'm afraid you're no Roald Dahl."
4,Good for my 1st Archer book,"I consider this compilation of fast-paced short stories to be a good read. If critics say this is not one of Archer's best, then, I look forward to reading his other materials.Compared with Roald Dahl's Tale of the Unexpected, which is also a compilation of short stories, I prefer this one more."
2,Not one of the Jeffrey Archer masterpieces ....,"I liked Archer's novels better than this collection of short stories. These stories are written with vivid descriptions, but they fail to pack a punch.One commmonality among the short stories is the Archer penchant of an unexpected finish. Though at times, this too gets to be as predictable as discovering the identity of 'bad guys' in a Superman comic."
3,Okay for an author of Jeferry Archers Calibre,The book is nice. The endings are usually totally different from what you expect. Nice book to take with you if you are on a metro or taking a long journey or on holiday. Those looking for a literary genius please avoid.
2,"Re-defining the term ""Red Herring""","Jeffrey Archer is one of my favourite authors, so youcan imagine my disappointment with this book. A ""red herring""is supposed to surprise you; the ending of each story issupposed to knock you off your feet and scream ""Boomshakalaka!"".Unfortunately, Archer succeeded to (mildly) surprise mewith one story only - out of the twelve, and that, in mybook, reads ""total failure"". Archer should stickto his one-story-per-book approach, and abandon theseforays into the short-story genre."
4,Nice looking...a little quirky,"I needed a nice looking clock radio with ipod support for less than $100. This just about fills the bill, however, my old $25 Sony clock radio has buttons much better figured out in terms of intuitive use. Biggest problem to date has been that it will stop working for no reason. So far I haven't really solved this, except that I unplug it, replug and play with the buttons again."
1,didn't work,I don't know if maybe I just got a defective product or if they're all bad but mine did not work. I was able to turn it on but the speakers didn't work. The selling company emailed me to check up on my satisfaction and quickly got back to me about how to return it which was good. They were sold out so I couldn't exchange it so I was just refunded.
1,Can't be played with--falls apart,"A very disappointing toy. Very flimsy pieces fall apart at the slightest touch. We got this for my 6-yr-old and he was excited--then we opened the box and he got to use it. Nowhere near the ""playability"" of the 12"" Joes from my childhood."
2,GI Joe Parachute is a Ripoff,"This toy is without instructions as to how it should be used for play. What heighth does one have to get to get it to work? If you toss it into the air, everything comes off it and is loss if you should be in the back yard, and the parachute still does not open fully. Overpriced ripoff is all I can say. I bought two of them! I hope you will not make the same mistake."
3,Disappointing parachute issues.,We love GI Joe but the parachute is a pain. My son is 5 and can't hook it up himself without entangling every extremity of the action figure. We need to drop it off our 2nd floor landing and it never really opens fully to support the weight. Parents should plan on lots of assisted play and kids should expect frustration.
4,I like this !!!,"I like this toy. I got it on sale $10 free shipping. I play with it a lot. It is very good quility and realistic. I recommend this toy very much to any g.i. joe lovers! The parachute is cool and realy works. I like the sniper rifle because it is very durable, but you have to be careful with it. This is a good toy!"
3,Paratrooper GI Joe,It's cool but didn't come with directions and none are available which makes the parachute useless.
4,Good & lightweight yet warm too.,Nice color if you like pink and it's warmer than you'd think for how lightweight the material is. Washes very easily too.
3,Frayed edges and long loose thread after washing,"I was hoping these towels wouldn't fray, but one did, one did not. After washing, probably 10"" of one edge was frayed considerably with a long thread undone which has to be cut off at the risk of the whole edge coming undone.I use one towel to cover a bread cutting board when it is not in use so that I can enjoy it. The material is lovely."
4,Final episodes of Generation 1,"This set contains the final episodes of Generation 1 Transformers. It picks up where the movie left off, although I feel that the episodes in this set aren't as good as the first 2 seasons let alone the movie. If you watch this set without watching the movie prior to this, you're going to be confused as to what happened between Seasons 2 & 3, especially due to a new Autobot leader as well as a new Decepticon leader. The ending of Season 3 a lot of people enjoyed that and for those who haven't seen this series I won't say a thing, never like giving away any kind of spoilers just hints. There's only 3 episodes that make up of Season 4 which would later become what is known as the 'Headmasters' series. I give Seasons 3 & 4, 4 stars out of 5."
4,the gen 1 is far superior!!! gotta love the originals!!!,"DOes any fan of the show like myself think that Megatron, Soundwave, Starscream, Rumble voices are like so cool?? Love the comedy between megatron and starscream. Star is always trying to overthrown megatron in some way, any chance he can get and if he -megatron finds out he like so mad..cracks me up! Love the older cartoons better the simpsons, tmnt-original series and tranformers G-1, inspector gadget my faves!!! anyone agree? p.s who does starscream and megatrons voices??? thanks"
3,The deathnail.,"I loved the original Transformers. The movie came and went and I thought it was awesome too. The new episodes started but the show wasn't the same. I remember as a kid being confused as what the heck I was watching. The show eventually met its end and stuff like Captain Power or C.O.P.S took over. This box set is great, but I wouldn't say its great because of quality. The animation is horrible. Post movie the new episodes were animated by a cheaper company in Japan and it shows. Devastator is the size of a regular Decepticon and sometimes their are characters clitches. Like an autobot randomly hanging out with a decepticon. The worst is however the animation quality. Its almost on lazy standards. I do enjoy the show mostly because it reminds me of when I was a kid, but going cheap really killed this great show."
4,Transformers Season 3,"I know I'm in the minority on this. But I don't care. This season was vast improvement from season 2 for me. This is where everything ties together. Yeah it was sad to see some of the characters from Season 1 get trashed, but c'mon! We got characters just as likeable out of the deal. Even at 8 years old, this was my favorite season. We get more space adventures, some attempt at character development for Rodimus Prime, and the best Transformers origin story ever. With the exception of the 3 part Rebirth episode and the Return of Optimus Prime, this Season had some of the better episodes."
3,"No Megatron, Starscream and Optimus is like the NBA without Jordan, Bird and Magic","Sure Starscream shows up as a ghost in one episode but that was my guy, after he died in the movie I knew this series wouldn't be the same. Accompany that with Optimus not coming back til the end of the season, and the pitiful attempt to resurrect Megatron as Galvatron gay is all I can say about that! We all grew up watching Transformers for the big names Starscream (my guy), Optimus, and Megatron without them this series was really on borrowed time. Stick to Season 1 and Season 2!"
1,disappointment,"This item is so small, I was really not happy about it.Sending it back may take more effort than the time is worth.I am very disappointed.Is not worth a rating"
4,Another one from Bob & Doug....,"This has got some pretty fantastic songs on it, for sure. There is an undefined '70's influence running through the entire thing - Doug's distorted tone is of a Black Sabbath hue. But I can't help feeling that Bob sounds tired on this one; his melodies aren't as melodic as they have been, and often he will resort to intoning strange monologues over music that I wish he would have sung on. Songs like Shorter Virgins and Surgeon Is Complete would've benefited from more expressive vocals, in my opinion. I feel like Doug really carries this one. My favorite is Society Dome - just beautiful. Everything gels on that number. As far as Bob & Doug output, I prefer Speak Kindly Of Your Volunteer Fire Department, but this ain't bad a'tall."
2,agree with reviewer below,"I agree with the review below. Hobbs is really condescending. He insults anyone who's ever bought a petunia. And he expects the reader to buy expensive, rare, and tender plants in order to be interesting. But then he insults the reader by saying that a banana in the garden is like ""foliar graffitti."" Well, which is it? I don't appreciate the mixed messages of encouraging creativity and then mocking those who do try to be creative. I did not like this book.It's also assumed that readers have the money, time, and knowledge to stage their gardens. Not everyone owns a rare plant nursery! And has a whole staff to help them with their garden."
2,All About Echeverias,"If you love Echeverias, bowling balls and risque sculptures in your garden, you'll also love this book. A big disappointment after Shocking Beauty."
1,Jewel Box Garden,Amazon has been nagging me to write a review...HERE goesTHIS book is NOT AVAILABLE. (Or wasn't when I ordered it)People - Please check your records as to whether the customers actually RECIEVED the items - before you repeatedly email these review requests!!!!!!!!
1,Old and disappointing,"What a disappointment this DVD is. There is nothing complete about this 'guide' to channelling. It merely skims over the idea of channelling and has a few examples of channels demonstrating their 'abilities'. There is nothing profound about the information channelled - it is all routine, basic everyday conversation. Another Penny Price production with a recent production date (2006), but using VERY old information and substandard material and video and audio footage. Not recommended."
1,Too old stuff for the new age,I bought the CD and got very disappointed after viewing it. It was filmed over 20 years ago. The film was showcase of four channelers who did not add any thing new to my knowledge. I do not recommend this anyone.
3,REMASTER???,"As much as I love this CD and ELO, this is the weakest remaster that they have released. If it is remastered. I always play the old CD and the New Remaster to compare. The new CD volume is almost identicle to the original, as if they just ran it off on more modern equiptment. The sound is fairly thin, not a lot of bottom end. Like the original CD. The"" Face the Music"" CD was a major step forward in sound Quality, as were the other remastered releases.. I can't say that about this one. This is Jeff Lynne's best work..Actually, I don't see anywhere on the package or CD where it say's Remastered..I don't want to be to harsh here..I love this CD..I was expecting better sound. Still a masterpiece..."
3,REMASTER???,"I don't find this a remaster at all...Has anyone compared this to the 1990 release? The sound is not much of a change...but then, I don't see where Amazon or the CD packaging claim it to be a remaster...The other ELO CD's that state remasters are great. This is still a great CD."
4,E.L.O just the letters say all i need to say,I was doing a search for E.L.O and found this a complation of whats on the market ..bloody good .well the album I have a copy on vinal thats well...had its days now i have the cd a dam good investment im a bit of a nutter when it comes to elo so mutch so that i am still looking for all thear albums on cd ....and doing well ........this album is a good start for an up n coming fan the ufo you see on the cover was a prop thay used on a tour so thats the cover...the music well some is a bit toung in cheak some is just experimental some has a bit to say on whats going on in the world then (hidden stuff n hints ie:secret messages)....but hay lets non forget one thing ....just sit back and ENJOY E.L.O........At thear best ....
1,Side 1 and side 1,The condition of the records themselves were fine and they arrived in a timely matter but unfortunately this record is a 2 disk and it came with 2 of the same record. :(
2,wow i wasnt expecting this,"this compilation is for diehard elo fans. i just could not relate to any of the songs. in my opinion their album oOLE' ELO, is more my cup of tea."
4,fine symphony pop/rock,"an excellent album of rock/pop music with classical overtones. the group's leader, jeff lynne, is an extremely talented individual with an extraordinary sense for fine pop melodies. the classical overtones are more mozart, than say, stravinsky or mahler. the orchestra is always moving forward, elegantly, to a satisfying resolution on each song. the songs themselves are almost all fine, but my one gripe would be that this was a two record set, thus a looong cd, and the tempos of the songs are all fairly similar (upbeat, but not really hard rocking), thus towards the end it does seem that some editing could have been used, and the whole thing made just a tad shorter. small complaint though. i highly recomment this album. wonderful stuff."
5,A Wide Load!,"Across 16 selections ""Out Of The Blue"" tend to make you realize ELO don't deserve much of their criticism-their music isn't so much pompous art rock as it is elaborate Beatle-likepop/rock with catchy melodies and grand vocals and nothing hereon ""Out Of The Blue"" is removed from that,except for three tracksin the tropical-influenced ritual of ""Jungle"",the synth-rock hitin ""Turn to Stone"" and the very clished Beatle-sounding""Mr.Blue-Sky""-the three best and stand-out songs here.But nothingelse lacks melody so keep on listening-you'll be glad you did!"
5,ELO's Very Best Album,"I really like ELO's unique style, and Out of the Blue is my absolute favorite. I get tired of listening to their other albums - composed mostly of songs that simply miss the mark, or consist of too much Top 40 jello. This album is their most dynamic and I never get tired of listening to it. The mix of songs is just right, with real zingers like ""Turn to Stone"" and ""Sweet Talkin' Woman"" flowing into others with a different twist. And living around Seattle, the juxtaposition of ""Standing in the Rain,"" ""Summer and Lighting,"" and ""Mr. Blue Sky"" is simply brilliant. Lacking a strong cup of joe, ""Mr. Blue Sky"" replaces a jolt of [...]e anyday. Crank it, baby! Awesome. ""Steppin' Out"" brings a touch of melancholy that is so unusual in popular music. Wow - nuance!? Amazing!Ok, the Whale is a bit much - unless I'm in the mood, then it is the greatest. This is a wonderful album and deserves a re-issue. The Amazon review is totally wrong-o this time around."
5,excellent....,"i am 16 years old and recently came across out of the blue. the songs are catchy and memorable; i fell in love with the album instantly. i definietly recomend this, whether you are a new fan like me or you are and old fan looking to expand your collection. in my opinion, out of the blue is second to only a new world record."
5,The Best ELO Album!,"I have always been a late 70's rock fan. When I first bought this as an record album I wore the vinyl down until the grooves were dull and flat. Now with the CD version that same excellent sound is there. This album shows more range of the group then any of ELO's other albums. This album was the turning point of the group from Classic Rock with violins too Pop-rock and the high tech sound, like in their albums Discovery and Time. To know Electric Light Orchestra you need to own this album, Out of the Blue."
5,Pure Joy,"This was the album that got me turned on to ELO. After listening to this, I went out and bought every album that they produced, and have enjoyed every one of them. I had been buying the CD versions, but with the remasters all in the process, I'm waiting for each one.This one is currently being shipped, as I purchased it from another site.Something that I did not see listed here is the list of Unreleased Bonus Tracks included on this CD, which are as follows:Wild West Hero (Alternate Bridge: Home Demo)The Quick And The DaftLatitude 88 NorthLatitude 88 North was recently released as a new single, and is getting considerable air time in the UK.If you like ELO, you'll love this CD. If you're not sure, I know that you're familiar with Turn to Stone, Sweet Talkin' Woman, and the huge hit, Mr. Blue Sky. Those three songs alone should tell you that the rest of the CD will be pure joy."
5,kinda like seeing the birth of christ,"one of my roommates questioned where i had heard of this album. i told him the old testament. he believed me and bought it. i suggest you do the same.i like the pop on this album. if you like this, listen to merzbow, the parallels are uncanny!"
4,stands the test of time,"I'm too broke 2 buy new music, so I'm going through all the vinyl i've ever bought in my life alphabetically, just got up to E and wasn't looking forward too much to my ELO albums which i bought as a kid in the '70s . But haven't been able take this one off, it sounds awesome on a 21st cetury stereo.There are some fillers - birmighamblues, jungle, steppinout, acrosstheborder but the rest is gold. mind you facethemusic is the album to buy, but i even like discovery at the moment so who'd trust my iopinion.nevermind, i'm listening to brianeno tomorrow, then theexploited"
1,Mediocre cheezy radio music from the bowels of the '70s,"This band, while starting out well (The Move are a great '60s psych band) was by the time of Out Of The Blue the epitome of corporate, commercial shlock. I could barely tolerate their particular brand of ""rock"" back when I was in highschool, but now they sound even more dated and downright silly. It's gutless, cheesy, whiny and without the benefit of nostalgia, sucks @ss. You know not everbody can be Brian Wilson or the Beatles no matter how hard they try, thank god. File under pretentious wankery."
5,SOLID ORCHESTRAL ROCK,"GREAT ORCHESTRAL POP ROCK MUSIC CONSISTING OF ACOUSTIC & ELECTRIC GUITARS,BASS,DRUMS,PIANO PLUS A WIDE VARIETY OF ELECTRONIC KEYBOARDS,PERCUSSION AND SPECIAL SOUND EFFECTS AS WELL AS NICE VOCALS BACKED BY A 40 PIECE ORCHESTRA AND CHOIR.THIS IS ONE OF ELECTRIC LIGHT ORCHESTA'S BEST DISCS. I REMEMBER VAGUALY IN A BEV BEVAN(THE DRUMMER)INTERVIEW W/SCOTT MUNI OF WNEW F.M.IN NYC BACK IN 1977 OR '78 IN WHICH BEV SAID THAT THE STRING ORCHESTRA PART WAS RECORDED TWICE OVER(OVERDUBBED)OR ON TOP OF EACH OTHER TO MAGNIFY THE SOUND OF THE ORCHESTRA.I'M NOT SURE IF THIS IS TRUE.DOES ANYBODY OUT THERE KNOW IF THIS WAS HOW IT WAS RECORDED?PLEASE LET ME KNOW OR MAYBE HOW I CAN FIND OUT ABOUT THIS.THANKS. DAN"
5,ELO AT THEIR PEAK!,"I HAVE HEARD ALL OF ELO'S ALBUMS, AND OWN MOST OF THEM AND I MUST STATE IN MY HUMBLE OPINION THAT THIS IS THEIR FINEST HOUR!"
5,A work of genius!,"This album is a gem, and ""must have"". 25+ years later and this disc sounds better than ever. All epics in their own right.Where do you start with these classics? Stunningly lush and brilliant, the tunes are daisy chained together to provide a wonderful listen. Time after time. No need to mention how underrated Jeff Lynne, that's a known. Sweet Talkin' Woman, Birmingham Blues, Across The Border, Wild West Hero, Steppin Out' to name a few. This is ELO's ""Sgt. Pepper"". Let's face it, if this isn't on your wish list, well, you figure it out!"
5,Classic ELO,"This album, along with A New World Record and Face The Music, are essentials in the ELO catalogueOut of The Blue flows very well from one song to another and shows ELO at the pinnacle of creativity (particularly Jeff Lynne).This fact can be why some songs are considered filler tunes. I personally love the album as a whole, but if I'd have to pick songs to leave off they'd be most of side 2 actually (the last half from Jungle on), The Whale, and Wild West Hero. I just feel they are a little weaker than the other songs on the album (maybe even Mr. Blue Sky).But as I said before, it is great the way it is. That's what makes it a good album.One more note : The production of this album is supremeo! Bravo to Jeff Lynne and associates!Worth the money for a cool trip!A+"
5,out of the blue,great cd we have been waiting for years for this to come out to replace our treasured vinyl
3,"OK, so I'm not going deaf.","I too was disapointed in the remaster. I've read the comments on the other reviews, and there are a number of reasons why the remaster didn't seem to meet my expectations. But the bottom line is that I bought this expecting a significant upgrade in the listening experience, and I didn't get it.The book is cool. The little cut-out spaceship and the printed stuff is a fitting tribute to this pop masterpiece, but I expected more in terms of sound, and bonus tracks for that matter (although what's there is good and we've already got a double album on one CD so there's not much space left for bonus tracks).I suppose that if this is the best that can be done after thirty years, then as the old saying goes: that's all there is; there isn't any more."
5,Absolute masterpiece,Out Of The Blue is an extraordinary album with production work that I couldn't even begin to compete with. I don't think any musician has the studio wizardry that Jeff Lynne has. Not Paul McCartney. Not John Lennon. Not Brian Wilson. Not Phil Spector. But the album is very very very very good. It blows my mind! Album of all time probably. I don't mean anything I'm saying here lightly. This album is unbelievable.
5,Excellent cruising info,"Mr. Young's cruising guides continue to impress us as the most useful and comprehensive available, particularly when linked with his excellent web-site."
4,Cruising Guide to Western Florida,"This much-needed guide provide a wealth of useful information for the cruising sailor. Written in an enthusiastic and readable style, the author invites the reader to explore the varied cruising grounds of Western Florida. Of great value in this coastline of difficult channels is the detailed information given for each approach, including low water depths in shoal channels. Another feature is a listing of the charts (by number) to cover each area. Photographs and non-navigational charts are also shown throughout the book. Altogether, an informative and useful guide."
2,"No good maps, too detailed",We picked this up for a week-long sailing charter out of Tampa. There is way too much information in here and no really good maps. (Certainly not any larger maps.) We wanted to locate good anchorages for day-fun and overnights.... This caters mostly to people who are looking to dock at a marina. I found the book confusing and not well indexed.... I was hoping for a bareboat charterer's guide like we have found for the Virgin Islands -- This is not it.
2,Cruising Books,I had the third addition and purchased version 7 in hope to look at a current Version totally updated. Like many revised books the purchase price multiplied but the new information did not!
3,Interesting...,"I still don't understand how Lassie showed up in the title to this movie because she plays a male dog named Bill. Elizabeth Taylor is OK, but the best actors in my opinion are Frank Morgan and Tom Drake. The end is heart-warming, but the trailers sure didn't sound like the film would give anybody warm fuzzies. Watch the movie before the trailers. It's better that way. All in all, this is worth watching for the scenery, with its breathtaking shots of mountains and lakes."
5,Sublime,"I'll add my praises of this disc to all the others. I fell totally in LOVE with Bossa Nova back in high school. I collected everything I could, from Best of Sergio Mendes - which is also very highly recommended to those who love this genre- to Joao Gilberto. In fact I made a trip to Brazil back in 1975 because I had to see this land where this sublime music came from. Anyway back to the disc. I had everything Jobim had recorded but this one intrigued me the most. It was his darkest and most complex. Worth adding to any collection of jazz, bossa, latin or anything else."
3,ok,no power its soft volume is like talking quietly if ya want to have some real fun this isnt the amp for ya if ya took a vow of silence and you dont want anyone 2 hear ya the amps for ya
4,Slammin',"I came across this movie on Showtime,but I've yet to see it from beginning to end.But I plan on catching it on demand.But what I'm writing in hopes that someone may be able to help me me in obtaining the song that's sung during the closing credits.I do know that the artist's name is Gary Clarke jr.and the song from the movie is called""I'll be just fine"".I've searched high and low for this song.Mr.Clarke does not even have this song on any of his 3 existing cd's that I found on cdbaby.com If there is anyone out there who is familiar with this song or with Gary Clarke jr's work who can help me I would really appreciate it.I just want to say that it's so sad when you hear all of this great music from these movies 9 times out of ten there is no existing soundtrack or any info as to how we can obtain the song or music.So many movies I've come across and the muscial artist get NO recognition.I know Mr.Clarke is based out of Texas as far as perfoming.Thankyou in advance for any help you may bring."

5,An outstanding compendium of modern photography.,"Olley has collected a wide range of pictures from some 20 or more photographers, most having different styles, selecting different model types, and using both colour and B&W to produce their art. The benefit of this approach is that you're sure to find some pictures that appeal to you, either intellectually or erotically.Each plate is indexed, so it would be possible to follow-up any interest you have by scouring the WWW or bookshops for further examples of your chosen photographer's work.This is a richly produced book, with glorious quality pictures but hampered to a degree by having a soft cover. Nonetheless, it represents a superb coffee-table book to entertain your friends."
3,Revoltech Revy.,A bit over priced but reasonable I guess if you compare it to the other really over priced items from this company. This is totally for display. I can see this comming apart with to much movement. So set it up the way you want it and leave it that way!!!
2,Torn book cover,"The book cover had 2 larger rips on front and back of the cover. For a price of $100 it is not acceptable. My husband really wanted the book for Christmas, and I did not have time to reorder, so I left the book and tried to fix the cover. Otherwise it would be going back."
5,This should be every true patriot's second bible!,"This soft cover easy to use compact book is a valuable reference tool for those who really desire to do something patriotic for this country and help keep their jobs!Even if consumer's change just a few of their brand choices on even the most minimal purchases, it would all add up to a stronger American economy regardless of your political stance!I was shocked to find out where the ""lion's share"" of the profits ended up on some of my former purchases!This book gives the consumer more power to make their choices ACCURATELY and I cannot wait for the updated second edition this spring!"
4,A MUST HAVE,I meant to give this book 5 stars!This book is VERY useful. Everyone should pick up a copy. It may just keep us out of an economic depression.
2,Does not focus on American made,"I can't recommend this book if you are looking for American made products. Book focuses on American owned companies. Big difference. While I understand the importance of supporting American owned companies, there are thousands of such companies producing junk in China. That is not what I'm looking for."
2,how to by American,"I haven't read the whole book, because so far I would have to hear from the author regarding why there are so many 'made in china' companies in his guide. I have not had time to contact him, but I saw furniture, clothing and shoe companies in this book, I know are not 'made in America' companies. I've lived in NC recently, and contacted the aclu on behalf of many of the long time employees of these factories, who are now on unemployment, instead of being compensated in any way by these factories for their many years of service. A few of these furniture companies stayed open on a smaller scale, or reopened, and are putting furniture together with kits from china. Several of the clothing and shoe labels he says are 'made in America', still say 'made in china' or other countries, when I see them in the stores, so I don't see where he's coming from yet.The aclu is another whole can of worms. This is not 'what they do'. They are also very unPatriotic."
1,Moronic,I just read the Review and selling off domestic-buying as patriotism is just idiotic. Restricting imports will eventually hurt exports and exports creat many more jobs domestically than the few lost because a product is bought abroad. The world market needs to be affluent in order to function and thus needs free trade. Buying American will hurt America in the long term.People who read this book should consider different opinions.
3,How Americans Can Buy American,Information was probably good when it was written. Kind of outdated. I liked the way the information was presented and would like to see something more recent.
4,read the first 5 chapters so far,"I bought this book for a graduate level database management course. It starts off with the very basics. Thankfully, my professor breezed through the first few chapters. Overall, the content is good and I would recommend it for anyone who wants to learn the theory behind database design and management."
2,don't judge the book by its looks,it's a thick book but doesn't have much depth and the way they cover the material will put most to sleep. An expensive >$100 database book should be much better.
3,Theory Theory Theory!!!,"My book was very poorly bound. It started to fall apart 2 months after I bought it. I would say the physical book quality is junk. As for the content, if you want to learn about relational algebra, DBMS operations, normalization and such in a theoretical context, then this is the book! It had a lot of good information on SQL statements. Don't be mislead by its description. There is some info on Access and practical database implementation, but not enough to mention. Just depends on what you need to learn."
1,Full of SQL syntax errors,"It is very disappointing that in its third edition this book has so many SQL errors that waste enormous amounts of time. Basically, if you do not have another resource handy you will make no progress with the example queries provided in this book."
4,"Good on relational theory, poor on object orientation","We use this book in a theoretical relational database course at the University of Oslo. The book gives an in-depth introduction to databases. It attempts to cover object oriented databases as well as relational, but there are quite a few errors in those sections of the book. If your primary interests are OO, get another book. If you need the theoretical fundaments of relational databases then this book is for you!"
3,A confusion of purpose,"This 1100 page tome of a book is a case study in what happens when you try to be all things to all people. There's a good book on database theory in there somewhere (most of chapters 5,6,10,11,...), and there's a good book on database design and practice, and there's a good book on database implementation.This book, though, is none of those good books. Instead, it is a gigantic bunch of unmotivated information that lacks any kind of focus or goal. It's impossible to read about database theory without being lectured about ER and EER diagrams or wading through ""business"" examples with employees and payroll systems. It's impossible to read about database design without encountering extreme formalism in the descriptions of the normal forms. The information needed for implementation is scattered so sparsely that one would be well-advised to find another book (preferably that weighs less than five pounds)."
2,"Good theory, more advanced","In my opinion, 70% of this book is theory. I don't understand how anybody can use this book as a continuous guide. The first couple of chapters of the book are great, but it goes down hill from there. This book is good for those that want to gain a deep understanding of DBMS and how they optimize queries or things of that nature, but this book should not be used for an undergrad course. This book explains alot of concepts behind DBMS, concepts that might be nice to know, but will not benefit you in your database implementation. There are a couple of chapters dedicated to SQL, but that is it. And to be honest, it did not help me much at all. I agree with another person who made the comment if your course uses only this book, drop it because it will probably be a waste of time, unless you are interested in the inner workings of a DBMS."
4,Great Resource! :),"This is an excellent and thorough analysis of database processes involving transactions, concurrency control, security and covers relational tables, object-relational databases as well as object oriented technology. There is a thorough overview of UML as well as ER design tools. It is a tough read and covers a lot of material and is very theoretical but practical. Relational algebra and calculus are covered thoroughly. This is recommended for an advanced database course as it's coverage of SQL is coarse and cursory. Instead this book is intended more for a behind the scenes analysis of database technology. An excellent database course as a prerequisite for using this book would use Mannino's Database Design, Application, Development and Administration. Mannino's book has an excellent coverage of SQL and its applications."
4,Good for School and database in general,"This is for someone who is very interested in database. maybe if you want to be a dba, system, or databasehouse analyst.Little bit old but very good."
1,An Absolute Abomination!,"I am a Sr. Database Analyst for a state agency! This pile of crap is an absolute abomination! It is written without any desire to educate the people who read it. It is impossible to read and is best left to use as kindling for a fire. I have never had a textbook as terrible as this! I think my calculus textbooks look like kindergarten work compared to this crap! The author is beyond arrogant, he has written a book that might as well have been written in Swahili. As a database analyst I have learned absolutely nothing from this book. I would rather recommend SQL for Mere Mortals! That is a book written for the audience. This book was written for nobody!"
3,"A lot of knowledge, but sometimes to abstract","As a student just started studying computer science, and knowing nothing about relational databases, I think that the author use to much mathematics to explain simple relations between tables and records and fields in a table.I would not recommend it to a total newcomer to relational databases. The author should have focused more on making the concepts easier to grasp for the students. In my opinion there are to much university school book theory, and to little focus on providing the reader with down-to-earth tools, to make it more suitable as a working tool in the real life.However after a more down-to-earth introduction with a book as, for instance, Database Design for Mere Mortals by Hernandez (doesn't include SQL though), I would certainly recommend it."
3,Purchased wrong edition,"Shipping was fast. However, the edition of the book was never stated, and I assumed it was the 4th edition since the covers looked the same. However, the book I received was the 2nd edition. I can notice some very subtle differences in the covers of the 2nd & 4th editions, but at the time, it looked the same to me. *** My advice is to clearly state on the description what edition the book is."
1,Badly explained topics,I am very disappointed with this book because the content is generally very badly explained. I constantly had to refer to other 'clearer' sources online regarding nearly all areas of reading for much better explanations which incidentally were regularly about a tenth of the length of text and a hundred times clearer.
1,thick/bad db book,"Try to avoid this book if you are not a faculty with a lot of db books on shelf already, or a beginner without experience on db, you will be dead if you are in the first db course with this book.Not clear with the writting is not a sin, but the organization of content is terrible,one has to refer back to chapter 7 frequently from other chapters 8, 14, 18 etc.Also some obvious data errors with Chapter 18 on query optimization. When the record of employee was referred as 6000, 5000, or 10000 in the same chapter's sections, make understanding very difficult."
5,Very Bright,"This light works well - I just received it and am still waiting for the grill to be delivered, but with 9 white LEDs, it'll light up the garage as well as a MagLight. Good, solid construction with o-ring seals around the battery compartment and electronics so you don't have to worry about it being in the rain. Of course, if you're grilling in the rain at night, you've probably had enough beer. If you're like me, though, this is perfect for those late-night barbecues in snow storms. For $20, it's a good bargain."
1,Wouldn't Stay On,"Very disappointed in quality of this product, on/off switch was defective when received... lamp would come on but would immediately start flickering and eventually just turn off by itself. Was purchased as a gift and told that product was no longer available when tried to exchange. :("
4,LED Grill Light,"My husband loved the grill light. He thought it was the coolest toy since the pocket knife! The light can be removed from the weighted base if needed. Although it gives off a small area of light, it can be moved around, or aimed by bending the flexible metal arm. It's a terrific toy for the bbq chef who thinks he has everything!"
4,Good Product,"My husband and I grill out alot, however with Daylight Savings, it is often after dark. The outdoor lights were not enough so I purchased this. It was such a good price, I thought we would give it a try. It has worked really well...the beam of light is fairly concentrated so we have to focus it on each item on the grill. However it is easily maneuverable and very lightweight. Definitely has helped us when grilling in the dark! If the beam were broader, I would have given it five stars."
3,grill light,Light is nice and bright but it is a pin point and needs to be repositioned after you turn over the meat. It's not waterproof so it needs to be brought inside after you use it.
4,Not a bad light,A very bright light for your grill...So bright in fact that it kind of 'washes out' the color of the meat directly under the light. But overall I am happy with the purchase and it does help a great deal.The construction is solid and it feel like a quality product.
5,Light is Detachable from Base,The light is extremely bright and removable from the base in case you want to use it as a flashlight. High quality at good price.
1,The WORST grill light ever,"The only good thing about this light is the stand. I was excited to get this light, as it seemed to be what I needed. Upon putting in the batteries though, I knew I had problems. The light flickers like the batteries don't make contact with the light. I tried cleaning the contacts, replacing the batteries, ect.Don't buy this light. You will be disappointed.j"
5,Fun Quiz Book,"The day after I bought this book, a bunch of my friends slept over at my house, and we spent the whole night doing the quizzes. We found out so much about ourselves and each other and became even better friends. My mom kept telling us we had to go to sleep, but we couldn't put the book down. Since you can take these quizzes more than once, my friends and I are already planning another sleepover in a few months so we can see how we've changed."
2,10 year olds and under!,i am 13 years old and i got this hoping it would be really fun and that me and my girl friends could use it at a sleep over. i was very disappointed in it i guess that its a good product just not the write age group. i suggest getting it for someone between the ages of 8 and 10! but check out more amazon.com products because amazon is amazing just not this product!
4,Good pre-teen book,"My granddaughter took this book with her everywhere for the first few days and then she lost interest. I think it was because she is such a prolific reader, she was looking for something more challenging."
4,Content,Book had some writing on a few pages and my daughter was trilled about that but we made it work so overall no problem.
5,Great value!,"These clips leads are of very good quality. Decent length too. I didn't really need the multiple colors, but I will make use of them for various tasks in testing electronics and making temporary connections."
3,Photoshop cs in the classroom,"Teaches the basics, if you don't have a desktop with Photoshop it won't help you much. Excellent for taking a course in college with."
3,a bit disappointed,"I was so looking forward to mastering this program with the help of this book/cd lessons. But there is a problem with the cd, it does not have all the same lessons on the cd as in the book??!! I am now on lesson 5 with no clue how to learn from this chapter. The lesson on the cd is not the same one used in the book under lesson 5. I guess between learning from the book/interent/and searching thur both hopefully I'll learn this. I guess there is no way to contact the author, there is more than one lesson that is messed up in the cd compared to the book. If your not use to working in photograph programs..(like me)..I would not buy this book.Way to many problems with the cd/book."
2,Lack of Attention to Detail Mars Series,Subtle and blantant errors ruin what would otherwise be a decent guide into Adobe products. Most chapters in this series of books leave out vital information or the exercises on the included CDs are missing files or do not match the printed materials.
4,"Good, but photos are weak","I read this book here in Brazil.I'm an agronomist(jobless) here in Brazil and I like to read books.I read this book translated to the portuguese.This book is great in size.The lessons are good.The main problem of this book are the photos.Almost all of them are B&W.This; book is good, but the photos are weak."
2,Not good in a pinch...,"I should have realized that the Classroom in a Book series is exactly what it says - it is definietly NOT a resource guide for those with specific problems and pressing deadlines. It may be a good introduction for those with unlimited time, but as a professional, it has been more frustrating that useful."
2,Book falls apart literally,"I found that by lesson nine the pages were falling out of the book. At $45 it should not fall apart that easily.I thought the end projects were often simplistic. But it does go through several of the new features. I wasn't impressed with the depth of the book.Also there were a lot of here put this in your picture, and you are done, but no how do I do that piece that you are haing me put in. Or set this at 50% but not why they chose 50% or what other options could be used for the same picture to get different variations.And I am really annoyed that it is falling apart. Adobe should have done better."
1,Not what I expected,This wasn't really a classroom in a book. It didn't guide me like a class & that is what I expected. Little disappointed with my first purchase in this series.
2,Not very accurate...,"This book would be good for beginners except for the fact that it skips some important steps that need to be taken. This was obviously written by someone who knows photoshop very well, however instead of going step by step as if writing for someone who has never touched photoshop he skips steps that more advanced users would catch on to, but a beginner would be left far behind wondering what they did wrong.Fortunately it has a pretty cover and a nice price tag along with a few helpful items.If you are a beginner....look elsewhere. The manual is a better place to start."
5,BING COUNTRYS BEST,"BING CROSBY TOOK SO MANY COUNTRY SONGS THAT SOLD WELL IN THE COUNTRY MARKET , THAN COVERED THEM AND MADE THEM INTERNATIONAL HITS. SO MANY ARE ON THIS ALBUM. A MUST FOR CROSBY FANS. DEAN MARTIN TOOK A PAGE FROM HIS IDOL AND ALSO TOOK COUNTRY SONGS TO MAJOR HITS INTERNATIONALLY WHEN CROSBY WAS RETIRED. THERE MUST BE A GOD BECAUSE ONLY A HIGHER BEING COULD HAVE BLESSED BING CROSBY WITH THAT HEAVENLY VOICE."
2,Terrible DVD transfer,"If you're a fan of this film and/or you just love obscure slashers, buy this DVD. If you're just a horror fan, don't buy this DVD. The transfer is terrible. I've only watched the first 10 minutes and the audio is barely audible in places, and the film is grainy and ugly--and not in a good way that might add to the terror."
2,Crap Transfer,"Let me just start by saying that I DO like the film(it is what it is)-but this DVD release is crap!Hmmm..let's see..It's basically worse picture quality than a rough VHS transfer,it has about 4 chapters,the audio volume changes throughout the movie and there are no extra features.I viewed a DVD from a friend who purchased a copy of this film off ebay,unfortunately it was an obvious bootleg,however it is sad to say that the quality of THAT transfer was far superior to the commercial release...Hmmm,emkay.Makes no sense to me.I guess my point is if you like the movie,buy the Amazon release,but if your expecting a quality DVD,don't."
3,"""The Final Terror"" worth a look for cast alone","Young Daryl Hannah, Joe Pantoliano, Adrian Zmed, and Rachel Ward are campers in the woods of Northern California who turn survivalist when they realize that there's a killer in their midst. Nothing terrific, but worth a look, if only to see the latter-day stars."
4,DVD review,"It's true if your a fan of the '80s slasher horror flicks this is a really good movie, that's why I had to get it when it came out. I just can't believe how much some people are asking for this though. The transfer was really bad. It looked like a was transfered right from my VHS copy, lines and all, a shame because I give this movie an 8, 10 being the best."
3,The Final Terror,"This is a worthwhile movie to view, if only for the presence of soon to be famous actors. Joe Pantoliano, Rachel Ward, Daryl Hannah,and Mark Metcalf (Seinfeld's The Maestro) star in this sometimes brilliant slasher epic. While the gore is not plentiful, the mood is effective. If you love horror that plays on isolation watch this movie. Gore hounds might be disappointed."
5,Great book,Great way to challenge your child and prepare for standardize testing. Also a wonderful book to use to keep your child sharp during the summer months.
3,Ehh...,"This cowbell is not too great.The sound is far too high-pitched and rings out way longer than a cowbell should.It doesn't even sound like a cowbell unless I put a sock in it.I am a bit disappointed in my purchase, but I guess it could be worse."
3,Very short,"I read the play Miss Julie so far, but I enjoyed that play tremendously. It went very quickly, but it was enjoyable."
3,Just so so,"Very little to say about this book except there are so many spelling errors! Not a lot of information on Greta, but there was a 1955 article from a newspaper about her inside the book, as well as another article about Theda Bara's death..."
3,Good Early Reader Chapter Book,"This is a simple story that relates the importance of encouraging others rather than judging them and putting them down. The plot is written for a young age group, but there is depth is the story's message.Kisana, the girl in the story, has always been told she is short and odd-looking. She meets people from a different village who treat her as an equal and she learns that she is valuable. With a new self-perception, she returns to her village and is later remembered as tall, beautiful, and graceful."
1,Toy does not roll across the floor as advertised,"We have a shape-sorting truck by shelcore that makes a truck noise and travels across the room. My boys loved it and I wanted to find another. I came across this and was hoping it would be as good. I was highly disappointed. It did shake and make noise, but it did not go across the floor like it was supposed to."
3,So Cute!,I purchased this for my 17 month old daughter as she loves music and dogs. Well this toy is so adorable and fun. The only reason I rated it 3 stars is because it does not roll so well on our linoleum floor. I suppose it would work better on hardwood or something else. You can tell its trying to move and if you give it a push it will move but not like it should I know. The color does differ from the one shown though. Overall a cute and fun toy.
5,U had to B there,"Punk was dead, but the Ants went on. This is a fantastic album if you were there (England - school - 1980). Almost everything that is good about this record it rooted in a few short months. All the really good bits that could be easily lifted have been lost - two drummers and and not taking yourself too seriously, seem to be lost. Sadly Adam believed tha marketing people and it slid into the sad parody of Prince Charming etc.. But for a time they were the brightest stars .... better to have burnt twice as bright!"
3,Mostly pleased but doesn't work in normal dvd player only in my computer dvd player.,"The quality of the images, selection of videos and extra's are wonderful. Sadly, the disc's wouldn't play in my home dvd player, but I am able to view on my computer. I wanted to share the music video's with my toddler son so we could dance to the Adam's great videos, but now I will just watch on my laptop."
5,entertaining mystery,"I love a mystery, especially if there is anything different about it. I liked this one a lot. It was fresh and original, a little Miss Marple, a little Tony Hillerman, but unlike either. I thought the lead character, Willi, was realistic, as a detective and a teacher concerned about her students. Having an Indian Texas Ranger helping her made the read fun."
1,Rather a Mess,The back cover copy lured me to buy this book on my lunch-hour. The characters start off well as does the mystery. But then it all goes to pot. The writing style -- while occasionally fresh -- frequently becomes incoherent. Willi Gallagher -- the sleuth/teacher -- is often too stupid to live but like the Energizer Bunny keeps on despite at least 4 unconsciousness-causing belts over the head. The murderer must be one of the most incompetent in all fiction. You know the book is in trouble when you are rooting for the murderer to finish off the slueth.
1,All Signs Point to Murder,"The title is catchy and lured me to select the book. I thought it might be a good read. This book is poorly plotted. It has the same flaw of many American mystery novels today that use the personality traits and character development of the heroine/hero,Willi Gahhagher in this instance, to cover over a thinly plotted novel. Unfortunately, the main character instead of coming across as likable, perky, determined and smart, comes across as irritating, silly, self-absorbed, and ultimately stupid. She has developed a more likeable and worthy character in Quannah Lassiter, a detective who is the nephew of the Sheriff in the County.This may be the beginning of a series. It can only get better."
1,Get thee to an editor,"Infuriatingly sloppy writing. At one point the main character is thinking about a piece of evidence she doesn't actually find until about twenty pages later. She also manages to confuse a white man with shocking white hair with her dark-haired, Native American love interest. The plot happily skips along to an obvious conclusion that is worth neither the time nor the money."
2,"Good Deal, But Bad Fit - Not Recommended","This blocks light really well due to the nose-covering design. HOWEVER, it also blocks my nose up and makes it hard to breathe. It exerts an ever-so-slight pressure on my nose that makes it harder to take a breath. ALSO due to the nose piece, it constantly slides UP and lets in light. Not recommended unless you have a tiny nose."
3,Great Mask,"I've ordered 3 of these in the last several years. I only have 2 issues with them:1) they come apart at the bridge of the nose after not a lot of use2)the strap on one of them was way short - glad my head isn't too largeOtherwise, they are awesome for blocking light."
1,Not for everyone.,"I work on a military base in Africa and sleep in a tent. I'm a side sleeper which means many products with clasps leave indentations in my head and are obvioulsy uncomfortable and very hot. As for this product, if they expanded on the idea of making different size masks with a bubbles that extend lower then it wouldn't scrape the sensitive area under my eyes waking me up."
4,The best,"Due to working shifts I frequently use sleep masks and have always used the normal flat fabric type. Earlier this year, when on holiday in the U.S, I came across this novel type of mask and decided to buy one. It is well made and very comfortable in use, and it really does allow your eyes to move freely. I only have two gripes: A small amount of light is let in around the nose area, however I have never used a mask that hasn't done this. It would be nice is the manufacturers could fix this, perhaps by adding a soft aluminium strip so the the mask could be made to seal around the difficult nose area. If it wasn't for this I would have given it 5/5. The second gripe is that, to my knowledge, it's not available in the UK."
4,Good Product,"Got this mask for a long plane ride and I'm using it for regular sleeping. It's very comfortable and even fits my tiny head. Although, I can see the need to add extra velco in the future if the strap becomes too stretched out and won't fit securly on my head.I used to use the satin eye covers, but they got very hot and irritated my skin. This product barely touches the delicate eye-area and stays cool and dry.Good price too. Even has a slight lavender scent to it."
2,"Poor Fit, let's light in","I guess you get what you pay for! I've been wearing sleeping masks for many years. This one is the least fitting and comfortable of any I've bought. It let's light in around the nose as there is no padding to seal it tightly. Given you are lying down, any light from night lights or equipment can be seen coming in under the mask. The plastic case it came in was broken badly and someone had wrapped it in saran wrap making me wonder if it had been returned previously. The cost to ship it was almost as much as the cost of the product. I wouldn't recommend this product."
4,Overall good,"Have a little problem fitting it over my nose, but it helps keep the room dark in the morning...Ann Lowe"
3,not so lights out,"I bought this thinking because of the style it would really be dark, but it still allows a little light from around the botton to come in. I tried adjusting it ect. It's ok, but not great."
3,"They're Ok...but, could be better.","I think they do block out all of the light, they fit great around my nose/eyes. The strap is comfortable...BUT, IF THEY WOULD ONLY STAY ON FACE THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT THAT WOULD SO MUCH BETTER!! I tend to move around a lot and they end up on the top of my head, or next to me, which clearly isn't all that helpful if you don't want light in your eyes???"
3,Lets light in around the nose area,The mask is comfortable around the face area but after a week or so of use the straps started irritating my ears. My ears are sore and some skin around the lobe is chaffing. They need to design a more comfortable strap. Even more irritating though is that the mask does not seal well around the nose. Light gets in around the nose area and makes it difficult to fall asleep. My bedroom window faces east and I get a lot of bright sunlight in the morning. I was hoping this mask would solve that problem. It didn't.Edit: I have washed this mask a few times since I bought it and it is falling apart badly now. I was even sure to wash it gently and let it hang dry. Now I'm back on Amazon looking for a replacement.
2,"OK, but","light in weight, and blocks MOST of the light, but didn't conform well to the area around my nose, letting a sliver of light in. The sleep mask I switched to (made by tempurpedic) does not have this problem, and although bulkier, its true lights-out ability (via conforming to almost any face) is without peer."
3,Pretty good.,"Unfortunantly a little bit of light can still peek in around the bottom of nose area. I guess if your eyes are closed this shouldn't be too bad, but do not use for playing pin the tail on the donkey or pinata! It bothers me for a few minutes before I stop thinking about it but than I just say ah, F it and fall asleep."
1,Good Morning!,"This sleep mask is useless - it is very flimsy, has a closure strap that is poorly made, and does not block out all the light around the nose. Why bother?"
5,"Good Concise Book, cuts to the chase","This is one of the best TOEFL or TOEIC books I have seen, and the best I have used definitely. There are 30 lessons, and most can be done in 1 hour, or up to 2 if you have a lot of discussion or slow students. It can even be used for advanced students as a brush up and conversation/listening book. The CD's are good and it contains exercises and explanations for listening, reading, identifying photos, etc."
2,too expensive!!,"This book is one of my studying TOEIC books and I found it was too high price comparing to the others. Anyways, it's good for u who just want to know how is the Toeic test likely."
4,A Solid Book.,"On To C++ is a very well written book. It describes every topic clearly and completely, and does not skip over anything. However, it is a little short, and it does not explain some non-C++ parts completely (it gives a VERY skimpy paragraph or so on reading data from files). Also, it does not give any recommendations or even basic instructions for buying and using compilers. On To C++ describes and explains C++ very well, but it is somewhat sketchy in describing certain areas related to programming."
5,Clear and thorough,"Of the many C++ books available on the market, this one does a remarkable job in introducing a beginner to the language. Everything is clearly defined, with all possible scenerios that can arise when using a concept/function. A common problem with programming books is that the student is often left to learn syntax and concepts from the examples of code given, and the accompanying explainations are usually terrible. This is the only book I have seen that avoids that problem. The layout of the book is helpful as well- it is divided into a number of small chapters, so it can be used as a reference guide. All the chapters are followed by short summary of what is outlined in the chapter and templates for using whatever functions are introduced. Without a doubt this one of the best C++ books out there."
4,A Good book for the price,"On to C++ at the price of $19 is a still.this book is a good choices for thous with outthe money for more expensive books for learn C++.even thou its a small book, only about 300 pages long.On to C++ has alots to offer for thous how are new to C++ and is not as overwhelming as some larger books may be for a beginer.Although On to C++ my not be for thous how won't a more comprehensive text on the subject, or thous looking for a book on a particular compiler, it deals mainly with the ANSI C++ convention, and dues a very good job."
3,OK for C++ beginners,"I think this book is good for someone who has programmed in C and would like to gently move ""on to C++"". However, it has two shortcomings: 1) the author uses the same monotonous example of trains throughout the text. 2) there are quite a few concepts in C++ (e.g. copy constructors, operator overloading, streaming) that the author spends little or no time on. 3) the author's explanation of templates at the end of the book seemed somewhat confusing, and could have beensimplified.On the positive side, I think it provides a good place to start for a programmer who needs a gentle introduction to C++ and knows some C."
4,a great survey of church history,I read this book for a seminary class and found the book to be great. It's an easy to read and interesting survey of church history. I still use the book often and certainly would recommend it.
5,A very good summary on Christian history.,"This is a very good book on Christian history. It does not delve profoundly into many subjects, but as a summary helps us to have a general idea of how Christianity developed through the years. A book everyone should have."
1,Stupid plot spoils this book,"The sappy, dumb plot of this book about two Pokemon falling in love is enough to turn off the kids who would otherwise be attracted to the book because of its Pokemon theme. While not a fan of Pokemon myself, I buy these books for my first grade son in order to encourage him to read independently. While the plots of all the Pokemon Jr. books are pretty preposterous, they usually have a little humor or action to at least hold a child's interest. This one however is just plain silly and even worse, is not engaging as an early reader book should be."
1,not good!,this item is no a good product at all. it gets stuck too often and does not work all the time. the only way to get it to work perfect is to extract it fully and that leaves extra cord everywhere. nobody should buy.
2,Mediocre,I was hoping to find those same haunting Bad Company melodies and fat guitar sounds from the 70's. In addition the song writing is mediore. I thought this album would fit in well with the rest of my Bad Company but that is not the case. None the less I had to get it just to say I heard it for myself. I will give a few more listens to see if it grows on me but right now I am not too impressed!! Sorry Mick!!! I still think your great!
1,I guess I'm not an Eddie Fisher fan,"I liked Eddie Fisher way back then, and his autobiography called ""Been There, Done That"" is fascinating, but I guess it's just me - his singing is overblown schmaltz, in my opinion. I kept thinking while listening that it's all ""plastic singing"" with no real emotion, and some of the songs are so bad that your toes curl. You can predict the words he's about to sing, in some of these awful songs, before he sings them.In his autobiography, Eddie Fisher says that at one point, he was more popular than Sinatra. I guess that's true, but today, when you listen to Sinatra, you hear some real emotion in a song. These songs by Eddie Fisher have no emotion in them. They still play Sinatra today, but I don't think you'll hear any of these songs by Eddie Fisher, on the radio anymore. The one good song in this collection is the duet with Perry Como, called ""Maybe."" (I'm enjoying Eddie Fisher's autobiography very much - I recommend that highly.)"
5,Get in mums good books.,"My mum isn't computer savvy - doesn't even have one - but is fast learning I can 'search' for things on mine. She had heard about this CD and asked if I could find it. Over to Amazon.com. I searched, found, ordered and received it and hey presto - guess who was the favourite daughter on Mothers Day. It was exactly what she wanted and had all the songs she remembered. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is an Eddie Fisher fan."
5,remarkable!,"A masterpiece by the Grand Master himself (Alfred Hitchock) this film stands up to all measures of time. Entertaining, suspenseful, educational, and simply brilliant in all traditional Hitchock ways, this movie is a must see for anyone who enjoys movies. The script is the strongest here, but exceptional performances, superb editing, and talented cast and crew make this film truly extraordinary.Originally, I had started watching this film on TV about a year ago and was intrigued but fell over from tiredness. I've been trying to track it down ever since. I'm definitely glad that I was finally able to get my hands on it. It looks very good on rewatch too and is the kind of film I wouldn't mind watching again and again."
3,A forgotten gem from the master.,"This spy-story runs long and sometimes you just want to fast forward to the great spectacular scenes. The second film from Hitchcock made in the states; Rebecca has a better plot and star power. Yet this six oscar nominated film does deserve a look at, especially the set pieces. There is no confrontations or suspense who is the villain, but the camera shots are worth the price of admission. Although the final sequence is a little predictable and the goofs are among the most obvious, it is still a ride I will continue to take."
2,Redemptive Hitchcock,"This is hardly Hitch's best but it does feature some redemptive set pieces. The best is a plane crash towards the end which is simply amazing for it's time. He also must have had a large budget because there are a lot of crowd scenes. The acting is pretty ordinary - Herbert Marshall is particularly dull - but Joel McCrea is rather likeable as the FC. And there is always Hitch's mischievous sense of humour, tho the patriotism at the end is pretty hard to stomach. It screams propaganda."
2,Standard Espionage Fare (With A Few Great Visuals),"Though I roundly consider Alfred Hitchcock to be one of the greatest film directors of all-time, there is one aspect of his filmmaking that rubs me the wrong way sometimes: a lack of a really engaging plot. Some of his films have it, while some do not. This one, unfortunately, does not.For a basic plot summary, ""Foreign Correspondent"" sees American reporter John Jones (Joel McCrea) sent into Europe to get the ""scoop"" on the upcoming war (WWII). While there, Jones and fellow lady friend Carol Fisher (Laraine Day) get caught up in an espionage plot involving the start of the war.I'll admit that the visuals are very well done for 1940, and a few sequences even provoke genuine suspense, but I just could not get into the plot whatsoever, as it seemed to drag on and on with little action or character development to move things forward.Thus, if you are a hard-core Hitch fan, watch this one. Otherwise, you might want to shy away."
1,Poor packageing,The DVD arrived with the outer envelope torn and the DVD case broken. I was also unaware that a Region 2 DVD ;would not play on our players. So we never did purchase the ;movie. A refund was done minus the shipping????? Does that seem fair with the poor package material?
2,Great Hitchcock? I don't think so!,"A spy thriller set just before the start of World War II, ""Foreign Correspondent"" is definitely one of Alfred Hitchcock's lesser efforts. The storyline is very confusing. It is way too long (over two hours). The script is definitely not up to Hitch's usually witty level. I honestly can't say I followed the plot very well because the movie kept putting me to sleep.It is partially redeemed by some fine performances, notably Joel McCrea in the title role, George Sanders playing an uncharacteristically heroic part, and Herbert Marshall as the leader of a supposed pacifist group. Best of all is the terrific and very exciting climax, one of the best in the Hitchcock canon. If only the rest of the movie had lived up to the ending."
2,A poor attempt.,"My five-year-old is addicted to Guitar Hero, so when I saw this product, I thought it would be a great way to wean him off that game and onto something that would actually help him learn. Unforutnately, the product doesn't live up to my expectations. The sound and ""fun"" quality just aren't there. The guitar isn't responsive enough, so he has to strum very hard to get it to recognize any input. The game doesn't do enough to teach how to use the guitar, and all the buttons and colors become very confusing. But this is for six years and up, you say? Well, I have just as much trouble as he does with it.Guitar Hero has already set the bar high for sound quality and graphics. Coming in late to the game, even if it is intended for a younger audience, this product should be of a little higher quality. The benefit was supposed to be that it teaches, but it does a very poor job of that as well.Bottom line: this product just isn't very much fun."
3,"Glad it has a ""guitar only"" mode","I purchased this for Christmas for my soon to be 6 year old, along with one extra game. It's really difficult for his age and I know someday if he is still interested in playing a guitar this toy will definately give him the ability to learn to actually play a REAL guitar. However for now I'm thankful that it has a ""guitar"" mode as well as the TV mode, because that's all he's interested in doing with it. It does sound really cool when it's not connected to the TV for a toy, I was expecting a lot less. I guess I view it as a future investment in his music talent, with the hopes that as he matures a bit he will have a complete understanding of what's going on. That factor considered, it was worth the $55.00 I paid for it."
4,Pleased with the guitar itself.,"I ordered this for my 3 year old nephew for Xmas. I was excited because I play guitar and he shows interest in music, so I thought this was a great way for him to learn. When he opened it this morning and I put the batteries in, everything was cool. This thing actually plays real chords and he loves to wear it and strum the strings.But when I tried to plug it into the TV, the cord to connect the guitar to the tv was damaged. So we can't play with that part of the toy, which I was looking forward to.I hate to deal with returns and what not, so I will most likely look for a cord replacement somewhere, instead of dealing with a whole product return.As far as I can tell, the guitar itself is a lot of fun. I've picked it up and played it a few times already. And he's been picking it up a lot throughout the day. He really likes it. And that makes me happy. When he's not playing it, I'll probably be playing it myself. :)"
1,Didn't get to use it because it didn't work; not satisfied at all!,"I purchased this for my grandson's birthday. When my son set it up and put in the cartridge it did not work; the video/image was distorted. I gave it a try myself. I followed the directions and the same thing happened, distorted image. Unfortunately there are none left for replacement so I am waiting for a Return Label to return it. Very, very dissapointed!"
2,BAH,"this thing is so frustrating!!!im 18 years old and consider myself a rather techno-phile and I get frustrated with this damn thing.sure yeah, its a good idea, a guitar hero rip off that actually teaches you guitar chords. but in practice it is frustrating.yeah any idiot with fingers and the ability to tell colors apart could use this in theory but the problem is, is that when the prompt on screen tells you to press the ""yellow"" and ""blue"" buttons on the neck you realise there are about four buttons of each color...so wich ones are right? how do you figure it out? you have to try about four different combinations before you get it right by chance. its stupid.do your kids a favor, pick up guitar hero. its way more simple and way more fun.btw, i dont actually own it, i just played with it at walmart"
2,Had high expectations but was disappointed,"My son was 5 when we gave him this present. It is a difficult toy, I would recommend more for the 10+ age group. However the most disappointing aspect was that it only lasted two months. My son takes care of his toys, so it wasn't due to 'abuse'. I am glad I only paid $25 here on Amazon."
4,Rock Star Fun For Kids,I purchased this guitar for my four year old son who loves music and all instruments. He hasn't put the toy down and I have definitely gotten my money's worth. The TV mode is better for older kids but playing the guitar on its own is just as much fun. A great toy for the price and playing with it simulates playing a real guitar!
3,Broken cord,"I bought this toy for my son this Christmas and the mini-jack on the AV cord broke within the first 5 minutes. Now I can't find this cord anywhere. It is not the same size as a cam corder cable. It is smaller, thus proving hard to find. I am not sure if the toy is fun or not, because we never even got it going for him. Can anyone point me to a replacement cord?"
1,Don't purchase this,"We purchased this for our son this past Christmas. When Christmas morning came, the thing barely worked. There seemed to be a short in the connection at the guitar. It did work once, but then failed completely. Prospective buyers should be aware that Mattel discontinued this product after one year. ([...]) That should tell you something. If you decide to purchase anyway, check the vendors return policy. We had great customer service through Kazizuri, so we were able to return it. Still, it's not worth the disappointment and hassle."
3,"Fun, but gets repetitive","This product is great for kids (or even adults!) with an interest in music. The character creation screen is fun, and ""performing"" in different locations gives the game variety. The only downside I found was the limited selection of songs. So while the game is fun, it can get mundane after awhile performing the same handful of songs that are given."
3,bought for my nephew,he wanted a guitar and one with strings. which this one does have but the quality of the product if far from whats expected.cheap plastic and not very user friendly.
2,Don't waste your money,I bought this from another online retailer in December '08. It worked for about a week and then started going haywire. I called the Fisher-Price hotline and they have discontinued the model. They'll give me a voucher towards another FP product but can't replace or repair the guitar. Very disappointing for my son.
4,He loves it,"I bought this for my 4 year old grandson. He loves it, because it's like Daddy's guitar hero. He can play it now, and according to my daughter, it will challenge him for quite some time. I'm very happy with this purchase."
3,"Great fun, but poorly built","My son got this for Christmas 2007 and loved it... however, the guitar only played when plugged into the TV, never alone...initially I never realized it was SUPPOSED to play solo... while plugged into the TV, it constantly kept disconnecting - you have to wiggle the jack that connects the guitar to the TV to make it work. I called Fisher Price and they were VERY nice...they sent a mailing label to mail the guitar back and replaced it with a completely new one...the new one works solo - which my son loves, but still has the same problem with the jack. So...it's great fun, but very frustrating as he has to keep getting me to help with the jack connection. A+ to Fisher Price for their customer service, C- for their product QA."
1,Pessimistic Drivel,"It is a shame that this book made it to print when there are so many other worthy manuscripts out there, waiting to be published. This book was so negative about the aspects of having children, I contemplated trashing it before donating it to our local library so that no one else would make the mistake of actually putting out money for it. Yes, parenting causes a lot of personal sacrifice and lifestyle changes, but not in such a way that one dislikes their children, as Mrs. Grody seems to. This book was written in a manner that suggests that children are an enormous burden; it is supposed to be humorous, but manages to leave you disgusted, rather than laughing. The flower-child of a mother depicted seems to have more regard for Green Peace than for her own children. It would be best to find a book by Erma Bombeck if you are in need of a good-natured, tasteful laugh about the trials of child rearing."
3,This toy is fun! A good deal!,"This was a good deal. I got the caucauscean figure for ten dollars.The parachute does work. You have to carefully look at the instructions. the sniper rifle is fragile, but everything else about it is a great deal."
5,Very interesting!!,I love Lovers and Players. This is the first time I read one of Jackie Collins' books and I can not wait till the next. It is a very interesting story line and it kept me wanting to read more and more. I could not put the book down. LOVE IT!!
4,Another Multi-book Family Saga is Born!,"The Lucky Santangelo of the new millenium has arrived! This latest read, and hopefully just the first, does not disappoint. Fast paced, with excellent characterization. It leaves you, or at least me, wanting more of the Diamond brothers, and newly discovered sisters...much more. I hope JC decides to continue on with another book utilizing these characters. You just KNOW that little Lulu is going to be a force to be reckoned with once she's a little older....should be an interesting ride!"
3,"""What Happened?""","I've read all of Ms. Collins books so far, and all I can say about this novel is....(yawn,yawn,yawn). What happened Ms. Collins? Where's the spice, the raunchiness, the clever storylines, the unique characters? Your novels used to be excellent, but now they're just so-so. Are you running out of new material to write? I think so. It's like you're recycling or something. The s.o.b. billionaire, the long lost sibling noone knew about, the heiress who's a (female dog) or who's sweet and naive, somebody gets killed, and let's not forget the minority bestfriend. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt, maybe you're going through a writer's slump or something."
4,"Sex, Murder & Secrets","What a story! Sex, murder and secrets dominate the plot over seven days. The book starts with a meeting being called by controlling billionaire Red Diamond, whose manipulative behavior has determined the fate of his sons' lives as well as any others who cross his path. His character is easy to hate while his sons are easy to identify with. The story intertwines the lives of an aspiring singer and an heiress. I couldn't put this book down even though the ending was somewhat predictable. I can imagine three sequels based upon the lives of those touched by Red."
5,Loved it!! She did it again!,"I was concerned that I had ""out grown"" Jackie Collins, or lost my interest when her new book came out. BUT - WOW - she got me again! FABULOUS - FANTASTIC - I did not see any of it coming! Bravo! I fell in love all over again. Thanks for another great book!"
2,storyteller,"If you like Tales about the rich and famous and the lives of luxury that they lead, you'll like this book. If you're tired of reading about spoiled people who take no consequences for their own actions, then you won't like this book. As always, Jackie Collins is a great storyteller and this book is full of sex, lies and dirty dealings."
5,Another Great Book by Jackie Collins,"I loved this book!!! As with all Jackie Collins books, there is so much going on to keep your interest. I could not put this book down. Fabulous Read!!!"
1,Tremendously boring,"Jackie Collins has bored me for quite awhile now. All of her books are way predictable, the characters are the same in each and every book. She used to by the mistress of sex appeal..At one time her books were steamy with lots of action now they are tremendously boring!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Couldn't Finish It,"I've been a Jackie Collins fan for nearly 20 years, but I just could not finish this novel. It was boring, the plot was an old rehash of everything Collins has ever written, and the characters poorly developed. I don't know if it's the 24/7 news world we live, but nothing Collins writes anymore is new and exciting. We seen and read all this many times before."
2,Just not worth it,"The kind of book you buy in an airport and read once. Though I was genuinely surprised at the end, this book was just too repetetive to enjoy. Seeing the same phrases and descriptions over and over again made this book just bearable. If you don't mind redundance then this might be just the book for you"
5,My proverbial Jackie cherry has been broken,"This book was my first foray into the dramatic world of Jackie Collins and it was the guiltiest pleasure. The book was near impossible for me to put down. It was an easy yet totally engrossing read. It played like a campy soap opera rollercoaster ride, and yes, it was fun! A reviewer was correct in saying that the character development was slightly weak and you didn't end up caring for anyone in particular but it didn't hinder my reading experience. I didn't know what to expect from a Jackie Collins novel and I would have to say I can see why she's so popular."
2,Could have been better,"This book has so many characters but its still hard to like any of them.All the characters seemed underdeveloped. Its also predictable. You can tell what is going to happen early on, and by the middle of the book you just dont care. Ive read JC books before but this one just seems like she ran out of steam."
2,Not like her other books,"I read the reviews before I read the book and didn't believe that it would be as bad as people were making it out to be, but they were right. One of the things that drove me crazy was the way that Max's daughter talked. She was supposed to be 5 years old and talked like a 2-3 year old - referring to herself in the 3rd person and repeating phrases or words 3 times in a row. Aside from that, I feel like this book could have been cut in half due to the repetitiveness of some of the character information or things that they said. Liberty's story was very not very interesting at all and was incredibly predictable and the ending was horrible and BORING!I love Jackie Collins books and this one was very disappointing in many ways."
5,great sound for the $,These speaks hit hard and sound clean for the price. You'll have to spend a lot more to get a better speaker than this. Great value ! Great sound !
4,Invisable Ghost,"The Boggart is a good book about this spirit named Boggart that likes to play tricks on alot of people. Emily always notices when the Boggart is ner by. She has seen floating things! I don't like when Emily comes out of the ice cream store and gets hit by a car. I also don't like when the Boggart controlled the cat. In this book the Boggart plays lots of trick and you to can learn them if you read this book. I would recomend this book to any one who can read, and i hope you read this book"
2,too many smart people dong unsmart things,"(Juvenile fantasy) A mischievous spirit inhabits an old castle in Scotland and accidentally gets transported to technologically modern Toronto. Mayhem ensues. How can he get home? This was mildly entertaining, but plenty of apparently smart adults who do surprisingly unsmart things. [Sigh.] I hate that kind of thing. (It reminds me of the scene in The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe when Peter and Susan ask the Professor if he thinks Lucy is mad, given that she thinks she's found a magical world. The Professor says, If you think Lucy is more honest than Edmund, then why would you think her mad just because she's found some other world? Forgive the poor paraphrase.)Potentially offensive material: nothing."
4,The Boggart,emeli and jessup had came back from castle keep they brought a desk with them. later in the book emeli relize that there is a boggart living in there house. the boggart play trick them and he thins to somewhere else and jessup and emeli got in trouble. when the boggart turn into a spider was because he did not wanted them to see him. the boggart also got trap in the train when emeli close the drawerthe boggart couldn't got out.
3,A light weight addition to the Cooper canon,"I firmly believe that the ""Dark is Rising"" sequence is the finest treatment, ever, of the Arthurian cycle, and is essential reading for anyone interested in the old tales or the art of story telling.That is what led me to ""The Boggart"". This is a perfectly charming book. But, it bears little resemblance to ""The Dark is Rising"". It is a mild diversion, with a charming Boggart, but slight development of other characters, a minimal plot, and a sketchy sense of place.It is cheerful and light hearted, but it mostly benefits from the simple fact that it was written by Susan Cooper."
4,The boggart,A restless ghost plays tricks on a countless number of people. The Boggart has lived in castle Keep for all his life. Suddenly The Boggart finds himself hopelessly locked in a desk and being transferred to Toronto. There he meets a new family but still continues his reign of mischeif....The genre of this book is fantasy.I liked this book becaus of the Boggart alone. He was hilarious! Even though he did harm one person. Everyone should be amazed by the novel. It pulls you in and never lets you out!
5,The Boggart,The Boggart is an exciting book about a spirit who accidently gets sent from Scotland to Canada. This book is full of magic and adventure. It was hard to put down.
4,Kalista's Opinion,"I would give The Boggart a thumbs up! This book is very interesting because of all this trickery and exicitment in it. This book just makes you want to keep turning the pages. When your done you want to read the sequal,(which I hope to read soon!)I think this book is for students in middle school because they are old enough to actually get the essence of the book. If your thinking of getting a book to read in your free time or at school this should be the one if you like myths or fantasies!"
3,The Boggart,"The Boggart lived in Castle Keep until he feel asleep in a desk that the Volniks took from the castle to their house. Once the Boggart wakes up he has all kinds of fun with the new entertatinment, such as electricity. Unfortunatly, the Boggart soon wants to go to his home, Castle Keep. I liked this book because the Boggart makes trouble in his own sort of way. I think another person would like this book because it has a lot of action. This stoy is a fiction thriller."
5,"A practical, easy-to-put-into-action business plan resource","This is the most pragmatic, easy to understand, and easy to follow book for creating a business plan I have found yet. ""Hurdle"" is designed for those that want to benefit from what a business plan can offer their business. The chapter ""About Business Numbers"" is the best I have read to understand the numbers behind a business and how they relate to the business plan. A quick read, a great resource, and a sound business investment. After reading ""Hurdle"", I wouldn't plan without it."
3,It is what it is...cute!,"So I collect giraffes. What can I say? This will be lots of fun in my classroom. I only wish the handle were longer. I was generous in rating it two stars for being educational - I figure it will help get my straying students back on task. I'm on vacation now, though; so far I've only tested it with mini Reese's cups. Works great! :oP"
2,very disapointing,"I am quite surprised that amazon's romance editor recommended this book. The writing level is very juvenile, for example, emotion is conveyed by using exclamtion marks and lots of emotional adjectives. The characters are stock and just about one-dimensional, either totally virginal and saintly (the heroine) or cruelly inhuman and murderous (the villan). The hero is another tortured one with a dark secret, which has been much better done in other books. Finally, the plot is just about formula, for example the major conflict running through the bulk of the book is very shallow--""I can't let myself love him or her, but my temperature boils whenever I am near him or her, oh what shall I do!"" I might have liked this book alot when I was 13, but adults want more than titilating sex scenes held together by melodrama."
4,Further confirms my suspicions,"I really knew beforehand a lot of what was going on and this film just confirmed many of my unproven theories. I am sharing this film with many others to help spread the information. This is a Must See Video.It is time for Americans to wake up and see what our country is really all about, and say ""NO MORE!"" This movie is an eye opener for the masses that think our presence in Iraq is admirable and patriotic. It is no wonder we have become the most hated nation in the world.It is requested on the back cover to ""share this film"" which I regard as permission to make copies and distribute not for profit. I wish more documentary producers would give this permission. These types of videos I always purchase an original if I can find it. It helps the maker re-coup some of their expenses, and produce more valuable information."
5,The war Profiteers,"After seeing Iraq for Sale I believe everyone should contact their representative in Washington and let him know if you are proud of him or asahamed of his preformance. Tax payers money is being thrown hand over fist to only a few contractors in Iraq. This CD went to any lengths to show the extreme profits that are being taken from Iraq and what a handful of our leaders tried to do to stop or slow down the drain on us. America knows how to make war, but nothing about how to make peace. It is my opinion that Iraq will be left worse off than when we started this mess. A few American companies will profit beond their wildest dreams."
3,Only 3 stars,"I don't understand why there was so much focus on those two families. The title is ""Iraq for Sale"" and it should read ""Iraq for Sale along with two angry families"" The story leads into a truck driver who was making $40k a year and realized he can make $140k a year trucking overseas. He didn't understand that this extra $100k was a risk premium the job demanded. His family didn't understand this extra $100k was risk premium for the job description. They were ignorant, period. Accidents happen, deadlines must be met, decisions are made in split seconds in the business word. Not all decisions are correct."
4,disgruntled review reader,"To those who dislike ""rap or hip hop"" music then you may politely mute your television and use the subtitle function on your DVD player or use the closed caption function on your television. If you don't have access to either of these options, you may politely write the producer and ask for a transcript. Other than the few simple-minded responses that this movie received, this was a rather exciting movie. The plot was kinda wack, but the fight scenes compensated for that. Since I am a fan of hip hop, the soundtrack to the film was superb."
4,"This is what it is, people - action and comedy","All right, so this movie isn't the best work Jet Li has done. It's not really the point. This is fun, mindless action and I really enjoyed it. True, the dubs on the English version are hokey. And that mask was a bit much, LOL - the point is people need to stop acting like every movie has to be Oscar quality and just grab some popcorn and have some fun once in a while."
2,Disappointing,"They have Jet in a futuristic Universal Soldier type movie? It just doesn't fit. The dubbing was horrible as usual. I am a Jet Li fan, but this movie just didn't do his name justice."
3,This is gonna be a 2-faced review,"I enjoyed this movie. I loved the soundtrack, so much in fact, that I went and bought it. And the DVD is on my ""to get"" list. But I can also say with no aparent bias, that this is one of the worst Jet Li movies I have ever seen. Told you so. So then why do I rag on a movie I enjoyed? Because like many, I love a good martial arts flick. And as long as you don't go into this thing expecting a good story, you'll be fine. After all, it worked for Bruce Lee..."
4,REALLY GOOD HIGH-FLYIN ACTION !!!,"THIS MOVIE IS JUST PACKED WITH ACTION.JEY LI IS A QUICK MARTIAL ART EXPERT.HE'S SO FAST THAT WHEN HE MADE LETHAL WEAPON 4 ,THE DIRECTORS ASKED HIM TO SLOW DOWN ON HIS KICKING AND OTHER MARTIAL ART MOVES.IN THIS MOVIE ""BLACK MASK"" I THINK THE DIRECTORS DIDN'T CARE IF HE WAS FAST OR NOT.YOU THINK THE MATRIX HAD GOOD FIGHTING SEENS YOU AIN'T SEEN NOTHING YET,JET LI ALONE BLOWS THE MATRIX OUT THE WATER.BUY THIS MOVIE NOW,IT'S PACKED WITH ACTION.THE BEST YET FROM JET LI ....."
2,Mildly entertaining,"Like the title says, this movie was mildly entertaining. The characters were flat and there was *very* little plot. Most of the action is gun-fighting. I EXPECT HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT IN A JET LI MOVIE! There were a few enetertaining fights, but not as much as, say, Twin Warriors (which was a far better movie, IMHO). My gripe with the fights is some of the angles were bad so you couldn't really see anything. Maybe I would have enjoyed Black Mask had I seen it subbed, but either way, this movie is definitely a rental first."
2,Nope !,Honestly I fell asleep watching this .. Black Mask didnt do Jet-LI Justice ..And I dont want to waste any breath for detail.I rented FIST OF LEGEND after and I was quickly revived! If you need to complete collection then buy.. But for watching it more than once I think not.....
2,"good fights, nice try at a plot.","good fights and all but the film just doesn't piece together, the editing was crappy none the less i still own it cause i'm a jet li fan"
3,"Great visuals, a potential director to watch out!","I am very impressed with the careful cameraworks in many places, and great visuals. I enjoy the details very much as a film buff. But the story needs further works, and it does not have that chemistry that the scriptwriter is intended. But lots of great visuals throughout. A very sincere production throughout. You can see a director has a lot of talents, and certainly he has that ""cinematic eye"". You can see the excutives are working very hard at its production, lots of interesting setting, props, etc. And the concept is quite good."
4,fun action,"I found this movie quite entertaining, but keep in mind that I love Jet Li, martial arts and campy movies. I found the dubbing quite amusing in places, but the fight scenes were really cool! I have watched it several times and am still amazed by Li's skills!"
2,It probably could have been terrific,"There is much to like about this film. The action is often breathtaking; Jet Li is a charismatic hero, and Karen Mok a charming heroine; the photography is superb; the sets and costumes are always interesting. Unfortunately, the film has been edited (at least, in the American version) as if it were a music video, with no concern for coherence. As a consequence, the overall story is murky (I never could figure out exactly what the bad guys were up to), and the composition of individual scenes is often confusing (in many of the fights, you have to guess who is hitting whom). I could also have done without the wall-to-wall rap soundtrack, but your taste may vary as to that."
1,Sexist and Trashy,I like Hong Kong flicks and I love Jet Li in them. This movie is a joke. It abuses Yuen Woo Ping's choreography. The scene in the bathroom when Jet Li backkicks a stupid mugger is the best display of martial arts in the whole film. Unless you're into boring sci-fi junk with no real substance...this is a big waste of time. The two women represented: One is supersex killer with fishnets (just what a modern fighting girl should wear - yuck)...and the other is ultra clingy and pathetic Karen Mok. What was Jet Li thinking?
2,"Not Jet's worse, but man was that bad","Now obviously the new rap music and great american voices they put on make it as bad as possible. But then again, the movie certainly is no gem in it's original language version, that is for sure.The whole movie had above average action sequences, but the story was unbearable. Not the story itself, but the execution of it is the worst possible. It goes from sickening moments to almost little kid parts between Jet and teh girl. Just freaking horrible.So the dvd is full screened, music is stupid, voice dubbing is almost as bad as the ""jet li collection"" movies, but you will get a few good points one or two good laughs, and a decent finale."
3,Stick With the Original HK Version,"Black Mask is an interesting film with Jet Li dressed up like Kato and going after guys, however this American release is strictly dogmeat. It has a hip-hop soundtrack that is just terrible and is poorly dubbed in English. I wish Amazon.com carried the subtitled DVD with the original soundtrack cause I'm certainly not picking up the Americanized version. Check that obscure video store that you have in your town where you go for good anime and ask for the HK version of this title."
1,weird translation,"as I remember when i watched the original chinese version, although it wasnt any big deal but I did like it as I remember, but this version is totally destroy that feeling, something about the translation is just bad to the core makes the movie like a piece of crap, especially some sound effect. Why don't they put the original track in it I hard can understand. if u can find some asian version and rewatch it u would agree with me. it worth my 3 stars with the original track"
3,"Lots of action, but cheesy.","Ok, so it's not Jet Li's greatest film, but it does have good action sequences. If you want to see him in a more traditional fighting movie, then see Fist of Legend. Easily his, maybe even the best, martial arts action film ever. But as for Mask, the amercanization really took away from it. The bad dubbing, the rap music, really ruined what could be great. I hope an authentic subtitled unamerican version emerges someday."
1,"nonsensical, silly, and dull!","I love Jet Li, which made me dislike this movie all the more. Some funny moments, some halfway cool moments, but boring overall. I am sure the original HK version is better, it couldn't be any worse! Also, nonstop bloodbaths and explosions cannot make up for the lack of a plot or the lack of GOOD fight scenes. This movie is SO DUMBED DOWN--why is that synonomous with American versions of films? TSK TSK, to someone up there."
3,i wanted to love this movie,i am a huge jet li fan and of course HAD to have this movie. and i did really like it. i think i would have liked it more had it not beed overdubbed in english and had no chinese language option. something for the studio to think about when they undoubtedly end up rereleasing it.
3,Good Fights,"As a Jet Li fan, I really enjoyed the fight scenes in this movie, but the story is nothing. My version is dubbed in english and probably cut, so cant rate this one fair. Anyway, see this movie for the fight scenes, not for the story."
3,Yuen Woo Ping and Jet Li are wasted,"When I read that Jet Li is starring and Yuen Woo Ping is the action choreographer, visions of sugarplums dance in my head. Problem is, you only get about 10 minutes of that great tandem...the rest of the film is a shoot 'em up. The opening scene is cool enough, but the first half of the film feels like the director was trying to shoot an art house film instead of an action film. A bit disapointing..."
3,NOT LI's Best But GOOD!,"This movie is not even on my top 10 JET LEE flicks but it is a good movie and I recommend buying it (if) you are a true martial arts movie collecter & fan. Trust me there are far worst martial arts flicks out there and this is not one of them! Don't listen to what everyone says, most JET LEE flicks are very good."
2,This movie does not live up to Jet Li,"When they decided to import this video over to amaerica they could have turned off a lot of people to one of the greatest action stars of our time. The import this movie when I can't even buy a copy of ""Tai Chi Master""? If you want to see Jet Li don't bother with this movie because it really sucked. Get a hold of ""Tai Chi Master"", ""Iron Monkey""... those are truly great action films."
2,One of Jet Li's worst.,"And I thought _Romeo must DIe_ was bad. Uggh. The only good thing in this movie would be the Martial Arts sequence, and the good job of dubbing the actors.The story is lame. It's basically reads like a script rejected for _Universal Soldier_.I have no real interest in the Characters.All and all a pretty rotten movie.If you want to see Jet Li at his best, get Fist of Legend instead."
3,Competent action/punch-up,"The plot is one that's showing signs of wear: There was a secret government experiment to create the super-soldier. The plan was shut down and the super-soldiers were to be put down like the rats at the end of a medical experiment. The super-soldiers escape and ---- and there's a lot of running around, a lot of good stunts and choreographed fighting, good guys, bad guys, and civilian bystanders. You know, the usual.Still, it's well done (as long as you ignore the cheesy Kato mask). If you like the karate/action genre, it's passable entertainment."
1,Maybe the worst movie I have ever seen in my life,"I went to this movie expecting to see more than 2 minutes of Jet Li doing real Martial Arts, like in Lethal Weapon 4. Instead I got a bunch of running up walls and flying through the air for an hour and a half. Give me a break. When is Jet Li going to do another Movie like LW4 where you got to see how talented he actually is? Aside from all that, the story was stupid and the effects could have been done by a college graphic arts class."
4,Barnabas Collins personal photos,A superb book of black & white photos! Jonathan Frid master of the role of Barnabas Collins from the gothic series Dark Shadows.Many photos of his personal life & acting rolls.A must have for any Johnathan Frid fan!
5,bible for photonics engineers,"This book is a masterpiece. The book is a great tutor whether you are a novice or an expert in the field. Great attention has been paid to detail (which is illustrated in the fact that you will find almost no typos in the book). Many different topics such as gain calculation, reflectors, waveguides, etc. have been comprehensively treated at both a qualitative and quantitative level. This leaves the reader with not just the methodology for computing parameters for lasers using equations, but also an intuitive understanding of the physical phenomena involved in making the calculations (via the qualitative analysis). The authors provide a unique perspective to many a phenomena that have been routinely treated by other texts. This is definitely one book for the archives!!!"
4,good but may be difficult for beginners,"For some derivations, I will suggest ""Principles and applications of optical communications"" by Max Ming-Kang Liu. It is more complete and easier to read for beginners."
5,Good Book about Jesus for Young Children,"Unfortunately, many books about Jesus are boring to my youngsters. They will often interrupt my reading to tell me they want a different book. This is one of the few Christian books that my children enjoy and request to hear multiple times. The book emphasizes Jesus' love for us, and lays out the basics of His birth, His death on the cross for our sins, and His character as revealed through His miracles and His love of children. The pictures are gentle and joyful, and emphasize family."
1,this is not a book,"for some reason, the general description did not show when i bought this product. these reviews are for something else. these are a set of a few blank note cards with envelopes. there are no Bible stories."
4,Good or not?,"I can`t decide! this book is good and this book is bad! I think this book is moor like a file then a Nancy Drew Mystery. I think that if we wanted a file we could get a file. But, I have to say that this book really is quite good! ( sigh) I guess this book is a reall mix! I still recamend this! I hope you enjoy!"
4,Australian SF Reader,"George Turner's Beloved Son is another of his books dealing with an outsider coming back and coming into conflict with a society that has changed and evolved while he has been away.After a decades long mission to the stars, a genetically advanced superman returns to the planet Earth, looking to be the man in charge."
1,mickey light,"the light is difficult (even for an adult) to push and hold the button and the light only flickers, even with brand new batteries."
4,A good Book,"Without scaring the reader through complex mathematics from page 1, Pierce introduces the subject in an intutive manner, which is the main strength of the Book. Any student interested in studying communication theory without being scared away, should study this book first"
3,Good book,"This is the first book I read about information theory. It is a good introduction explaining all the basic concepts and driving the reader through several examples to make you understand it, however it lacks some formality. I consider myself someone with a really good mathematical and physical background which probably drive me to prefer more formality and hard definitions.I recommend this book to most readers, be careful the ones that doesn't like to read a lot to grasp few concepts."
4,Not for me,I did not like this book but it will be appreciated by more techie folks. It is slow reading and heavily theory laden.
4,An intelligent view about the informationtheory.,"The book is sufficiently theoretical for allowing to understand the back-ground of the information theory very well.The language is adapted to formate an experience about those questions in a very logical way.Here it is developed an abstract theory, but also historical arguments.Particularly the author is able to communicate the sense of the formulation of the entropy equation, what is a concept very different from the term used in thermodinamics."
5,One of the best books I recently read!,"A very good introductory text to information theory. Written in a plain, comprehensive way without too many unnecessary equations. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a book in such topic!"
5,Best Price I could find,These were a Gift. They were given as a Xmas present..They had to have the button pockets The recipient says he Loves them...
5,"Carhartt Men's Quilt Lined Duck Bib Overall, Black, 34x32","This is standard wear in Alaska. Unlined in summer, lined in winter, and arctic lined in below zero temps. These bibs hold their shape and wear very well. Wouldn't wear anything else."
5,Help on a cold morning,"I have to get up at 2:30am to be at work by 4:00am two towns away in the next county. It's on top of a cold nob where the wind is almost always blowing. I just thank God in today's economy that I even have a job, but I thank Carhartt for making the lined overalls that make those first few minutes bearable as I get everything fired up and the heaters on so that those who come later don't have to deal with the elements."
5,Excellent,I ordered these overalls for my husband for Christmas. He loves them! They fit great and are very comfortable. Great quality.
5,Very Pleased,"Nice quality. True to size, ordered for our son who is 6'7"" and difficult to find pants long enough. They were perfect. Quick delivery. Would definately order from Amazon again. Very satisfied."
5,Awesome bibs!,This is an amazing company and their products are really well made and last forever! The only issue is it runs small so order a size bigger then you normally wear!
4,Really warm!,"We bought several of these for the guys & gals that work in our warehouse. They really like them - plenty warm, keeps their clothes cleaner, lots of pockets.Good stuff!"
5,Carhartt never ceases to satisfy!,I bought these for my son for Christmas. He loves Carhartt apparel because it is so durable and has protection on the job. These bibs fit like a glove but you need to make sure you know the size is not the same as it is for regular clothing. My son wears a 34 x 34 in jeans and I bought him a 40 x30 in the carhartts. They fit perfect! My suggestion is to try them on in the store and then buy them on Amazon to get the best price!
2,Sizes run small,"I had to send this item back because it was to small. The sizes run small, so beware."
5,carhartt bibs,This is a wonderful product. The wear ypu get from them and the warmth is great. This is something that will last a few years.
3,Warm work bibs,"These bib run a little small, I should have orded one size larger around the waste for putting on over other clothes.When I wear them by them self they fit fine. The buckles on the suspenders are a pain but they do work fine."
4,Good product and Good Service,The Overalls fit well and appear to be very durable. Delivery was timely. I rated the overalls 4 out 5 stars because the metal strap clasp did not appear to be the best quality (thin metal). But I believe the overalls will serve me well.
2,Carhartt Bibs/Cover-All,"I'm not very impressed with the quality of Carhartt bibs/cover-all I purchased--I will admit that I haven't purchased a new Carhartt coat or bib set in a long time--I had no idea how low the quality has gotten. First, the zippers are very cheap and get stuck easily, 2. The canvas material is not what it used to be either, my old set seemed to be bullet proof but this new set is not the same. 3. The sizes are so different, I ordered the bibs/cover-all a size larger than I wear, but when they were delivered and I tried them on, it was as if they were two sizes smaller. The material is thin, and the insulation is very cheap and again not what it used to be. I am very disappointed in this Carhartt product, to the extent I will probably not trust Carhartt with any more purchases. The quality is very low, but the prices are way too high for the quality."
3,Death Race,"(Death Race by Mark Kuhn., is a book that is an interview with Lance Macklin who called Mark Kuhn after some years to tell his side of the story of the tragedy of the 1955 Le Mans History. I was a little board with Macklin's previous affords and his wine and dinning affairs with different women. the finally the story is told. the book reaches into Mike Hawthorn's part of this affairs as well As Pierre Leviech,who can not defend their actions since their passing but gives you a good over view of both men . The book ends with questions and new safety regulations in set after the terrible accident, but is this fair and motorSport will continue to be a chance sport that involves life and death.Over all I rate this book as fair. I only purchased it to follow up on the different points of view and when I read that Lance Macklin was going to tell his story , that is why I purchased the book.Robert GecoMercedes-Benz enthusiast and historian"
4,Chair Yoga with Jackie,I am a Yoga Instructor and I do recommend Jackie's Chair Yoga. Jackie's chair yoga routine is excellent for beginners. Jackie's cues are clear and emphasize allignment and proper posture. Good job Jackie!
2,"Good information, but needs editing","This little book is packed with good information on grief associated with losses of various kinds, BUT someone should have edited this book before it went to press. Misspellings and poor punctuation distract from the content. Too bad, because it could be a good, professional book if not for the errors."
2,Early 80's movie with a 50's soundtrack and a 70's feel.,"Buying this movie I thought it would be like ""creature from black lake"", ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"", or ""shock Waves"". Well Im a lover of cheesey movies but this movie was too cheesey. Very sharp cheesey. I was time warping watching this movie. First I felt the 70's with the acting . Then I felt the 50's with the movie music. Then I felt the 70's again with the theme song in the begining and at the end of the movie. All in all I got what I payed for, a very sharp cheesey movie. Not bad but not that good, just very cheesey!"
2,Steve DP,"I found ""Bog"" to be everything I expected. It was made back in the day, way back in the day.The rubber suit effects smacked of the original Godzilla all over again.I was especially emamoured by the Kim Pierce character, played by the wild and wacky, Lou Hunt.I think that everyone enrolled in a film school shoud examine this movie closely as there are lessons to be learned here."
2,Disappointing,"The story line is good but I was disappointed in the creature. It was like something out of an old ""B"" movie from the 60's."
5,A huge roll of brown paper Great for wrapping books,"This roll is massive. It can be unwieldy to cut but for the price is a great value. I sell books online and wrap them in this sturdy brown paper. No complaints, just look at the measurements to make sure you have enough room for this...."
4,Good Quality,"I got this for gift wrapping since I have all of my family out of state and wind up shipping pretty much everything. It lasts forever! and while not stylish, it does a good job of wrapping things in heavy duty paper for shipping or just regular wrapping needs...lol"
3,"Huge roll, very fragile","This paper is a good value for the money. I had a large-scale project that required LOTS of craft paper, and this fit the bill. The amount of paper you receive is astounding. I was able to fully cover a 10 foot by 30 foot space and create artwork on top of it using more paper, and I still had some leftover. I will say that the paper is pretty fragile, and ripped while we were trying to hang it. However, I received so much that it wound up not being an issue. If you don't need heavy duty paper, this will be a good value."
4,"Great quality, middle of the road road price.",I'm not going to mark this down for quality. It's perfectly fine and is exactly as described.I looked around for a while without really knowing where to look for a roll of this paper to have a deep-fry cookout last summer. I was shopping mostly for price because it didn't need to be durable (which is rather is) and I didn't need a whole lot of it (which this is). I found this at a much better price than I was finding almost anywhere else and shipping was free (thank god) so I bought it. I have since found slightly less durable paper at a local craft store for a better price and on sale at office supply stores.
2,"Adequate, but Could be Improved","I brought this course having never studied Spanish before, and was disappointed in some things. The tapes are of poor technical quality with random fade-outs at crucial moments. The book seems to be poorly edited. In one instance, (I am only on chapter 3), there is a word in the answer key to a translation exercise that isn't introduced until several pages later. I also think the course would be more helpful if the exercises made some attempt to incorporate material studied in previous chapters, but instead, they focus narrowly on the material just covered. However, I am learning Spanish with this course,and I guess that is the bottom line."
4,Great to Re-learn Spanish,"This book is really great for those trying to re-learn spanish. It really moves too fast for a beginner. Therefore, for someone trying to learn spanish for the first time I would suggest reading 'Barron's Learning Spanish the Fast and Fun Way' before reading this book. This book covers a large amount of material in only 13 chapters. This is book is for serious self-study."
2,Not the spanish spoken in border towns,"If you are traveling to Europe or Argentina, this would probably be wonderful.....but if you are looking to communicate with those south of the US border, the pronunciation is not always the same. While the grammar is good, it was not what I was hoping for."
4,Good grill,"Very good grill. I can't Imagine finding anything close to this good for the money. Assembly was easy, all parts were intact. Some minor damage, I'll get into that later. I had it all together and was cooking on it in less than 3 hours. You may want it delivered to where you want to assemble, it is very heavy.Once assembled it is obviously a very sturdy unit. Cooking on it has been great. I cook most things in the middle with only the outside burners on for indirect cooking and it provides plenty of heat.As others have mentioned mine was also somewhat damaged upon arrival. They really need to change the way this unit is packaged. I also had a bdented door. I straihgtened it out faily well and it all went together fine. I need to adjust a bit more.All in all still worth the money I paid for it. After all, for $300 I wasn't expecting $1200 quality."
3,Useful though dated.,Necessarily rather skimpy due to such a huge scope for such a small book. Author's Victorian and somewhat chauvinistic bias can be understood.
3,Readable but emphasizes the Germanic mystique of the ruling class,"All Angles and Saxons! Celts need not apply! That said, if you can put that aside and can consider the time that she wrote, you may find it very worthwhile‚Äîand I am a Celt. My mother used to tell me that we were descended from the Bards of old."
5,Infinity kappa perfects are Awesome!,"I had a good transaction for purchase of this product, and the infinity kappa perfect speakers are awesome. Outstanding clarity; definitely a couple levels above my old alpine type R speakers. The infinity kappas are very bright, so I set the crossover jumper to -4db (tweeter has 3 volume settings). I also covered them slightly from the side to quiet them further and to stop lateral reflections in the car cabin. A little quarter sized cover over the woofers (dynaudio style) softened the ear sensative 2khz range, and now they sing beautifully and evenly. I couldn't be happier."
1,Absolutely Uninteresting,"I really didn't like this book at all. I thought the author spent an inordinate amount of time writing about what went on during jury selection and what the lawyers talked about during breaks. I found myself flipping through the pages just to see how many more chapters I would have to endure to get to anything interesting. Mr. Irving's writing style drones on endlessly and lulls the reader into utter boredom. There was so little focus on Cindy Campbell Ray - yet, she was the subject of the story. I was incredibly bored and couldn't wait for this book to end. Even the captions under the pictures were stupid. The quotes from the book that he picked to caption the photographs were inane. I think Clifford Irving is slightly self-absorbed and this got in the way of him writing anything interesting. This book was wretched from start to finish. To say any more would be wasting good words on a horrible book."
4,Addicting,"Is reading about murder addicting? No. Is reading about all of the people involved? Yes. Irving introduces all of the characters--victims, family, police officers, undercover detectives,lawyers, accused, almost everyone. It's more of a combination between character study and what really goes on behind the scenes of a murder case. The first 350 pages are entralling--I gasped and yes, I even laughed. The next 150 gets into courtroom drama. The last 100 I grazed through because I just wanted to find out what happened. I reccommed it--a thourough presentation of a terrible happening, and an author who reflects upon and ""personalizes"" this event into which he is drawn."
5,Death to the Lawyers! (Shakespeare),"First of all, I admit to being a fan of Clifford Irving's novels, most of which are, sadly, out of print. This is the only nonfiction book of his that I've read, and it's a winner. It tells of how a young woman and her Marine Corps boyfriend murdered her parents, but I won't spoil the story by discussing their motives. It's highly detailed, and I think that's a plus, since for the first time I understood the complexities and absurdities of jury selection, as well as the hidden motives of prosecutors and defense attorneys. Irving is involved in his own story -- he knew so much about the dramatis personae that he became, against his will, a witness at the trial! That makesa this a unique book, and one not to be missed by all who read ""courtroom"" fiction."
2,This story could have been told--,"with less verbiage. Very interesting story but frankly I could not finish the book. I cheated and went to the end of the story to see what happened. I always read all of true crime stories but this one was so needlessly and boringly long with so much useless trivial information. What a shame because the story itself is very interesting. I also agree with another person who reviewed the book; since David West is up for parole in the year 2000, I would like to know if in fact he will get paroled. Anyway, the bottom line is that the story somehow got lost in a ton of words that were unnessecary."
3,Too much filler,"The events leading to the Campbell double murder, and the hunt for the killer are more vividly related in Jack Olsen's ""Cold Kill."" I've just read Olsen's and Irving's respective narratives in succession, and for me, Jack Olsen's is far superior for readers who are fascinated by the crime and its participants.Unlike in Olsen's book, most of the action in Irving's takes place in courtrooms. If you find that interesting, you may enjoy the book. But if you want to cut to the chase, pick Olsen, or at least, read Olsen's book first."
2,Heavily focused on sex and paranoia - disappointing.,"The book started out as something I enjoyed reading and it gave me at least some level of understanding about my own feelings towards myself, other men and specifically other gay people. I was not impressed with the heavy focus on sex and the way he allowed it to permeate the book. Ultimately, I lost interest about where he starts in on how dangerous it is to be gay. I cannot live my life in fear and I refuse to take some of ""anti-gay"" precautions the author suggests. Sex is important and it is good but it isn't the basis of my life. I appreciate the effort the author put forth in any case."
2,"Wimpy, gave it up after half the book","Sorry, but I am NOT a victim, though I am gay. This book sounds like an endless talk show. To read this, you would think that we were living in Nazi germany, not the USA. This is NOT my experience of being gay-that we are constantly being victimized by others. It is my experience that those who don't understand that private sexual activity does not have to determine public dress, bumper stickers, behavior, etc, do ruffle other peoples feathers. But the same goes for straight people who refuse to tone down their blatant sexual preoccupation (putting pin up posters in their office, women who dress outrageously suggestive, etc). I hated this book. I also thought some of it was creepy-sexually obsessed. The author needs to get out of the gay ghetto and accept that 90% of the world's population is NOT gay."
2,"Great title, so-so book","This is another self-help book for gay people. I liked the title but did not get much out of the book. The author is very touchy-feely-sensitive and this got on my nerves after a while. Grow up! There isn't a lot of practical advice here, which is what I was looking for. I guess it is hard to actually give practical advice to gay people as a group since we are so different from each other."
2,CDROM does not have correct code,"I just bought this book today. The included CDROM has so many problems with missing files, misnamed files and misplaced files that I cannot in good conscience refrain from warning people about the problems with the CDROM. This does not mean that the CDROM is unusable, but anyone who expects to use the code on the CDROM should expect to do a LOT of work to fix files to the point where rebuilding the programs described in the book is possible.Coriolis says this book is warranteed for 90 days against bugs. It remains to be seen whether they will issue a new CDROM with a redone file tree that permits rebuilding the software with Visual Studio 97."
2,Rushed production in 14pt font,"I'm rather disappointed with this book. It has the overall sense of having been a rushed production and it uses a font size I haven't seen since kindergarten. I received more understanding of how to develop for a Windows based server in just two chapters (18 & 19) of Mike Blaszczak's ""Professional MFC with Visual C++ 5"" than with all of Don's book. Don has cute examples, but fails to impart any sense of understanding to the user."
1,"This is more like tomato sauce or bisque, not cream of tomato soup","If you want real cream of tomato soup that's reminiscent of your childhood, get the Pacific brand. This one is shockingly light on cream and the consistency resembles more of a marinara sauce. I use it too cook with but it's just too strong to use as a soup."
5,"Yum, yum, and more yum!","This soup is surprisingly good, I say ""surprisingly,"" because I usually am not a big fan of canned soups. I enjoy Amy's products, but the last soup I had from Amy's - a lentil curry - I did not enjoy very much.btw, I buy my Amy's soups at a local store for about $3.29, something like that.I had the tomato soup with a grilled cheese sandwich just now. The soup is a little sweet, as another reviewer mentioned, yet it's not sickeningly sweet.For me, the flavor is spot-on, comforting, delicious, and overall, it's filling. I will definitely be buying this again."
