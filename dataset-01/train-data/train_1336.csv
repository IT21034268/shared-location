3,Good Product,It worked without any problems. The only thing that it lacks of is an option where the hotkey can be changed.
4,works as advertised,"I purchased several of these for use around the office. They installed with no problems and continue to work without failure.I would buy more, but at this point I think most everyone has moved away from PS2 connections."
4,This switch works very nice,I have been using this switch for a few weeks now. It is really easy to install and operate. I am switching between my desktop and laptop by pressing ScrollLock twice.The only thing holding me back from giving it 5 stars is that I cant' use all the extra functions on my mouse and keyboard. I have the Logitech MX700 mouse and cordless keyboard.But this is tolerable for the convenience.
3,kmv switch,did not get to try it out......... ended up being the wrong item for the application i needed.
2,Worked OK for a month.,My previous KVM switch could not deliver enough resolution for my new graphics. The IOGEAR worked perfectly for a month until the number 2 mouse port died. Now the fun begins trying to get it replaced.
3,"Worked great for a while, but then....","I was really happy with the performance of this KVM switch. But after 5 months, it completely quit working. Though it was still under warranty, I had to go through the IOGEAR troubleshooting routine, then FAXed my proof of purchase to get an RMA. I had to ship to reach IOGEAR before my RMA expired, etc, etc. It's way too much time, money and trouble to get it fixed or replaced considering the cost of the item. Should I be looking forward to this in another few months???"
2,not good enough,"fair price, easy to install.. but the video shows worse than before the kvm switch installed. my officemate got belkin 4 port kvm, and its video quality was a lot better (the same as original vidoe without the kvm) than this iogear one. well, i guess you get what you pay for."
2,Major Flaw- Buyer Beware!!!,This product has a major flaw. I bought the Iogear based on the reviews here and else where. Brought it back. The mouse would not function on the line attached to my IBM laptop docking station. I found a note at the end of the instruction booklet that says it doesn't work with IBM and Toshiba laptops. No mention on the package and none in the reviews. BAD! IBM and Toshiba are huge so this is not a small flaw. I returned it a bought the Belkin which works flawlessly.
4,"Simplistic, very functional, and attractive","Amazing that something so simple as this actually WORKS. And there's no software to install at all, which is a relief. I didn't want to have to rely on yet ANOTHER background process running in my system tray(s) - I have enough of those to keep track of as it is.This is COOL! BUY it!"
5,It's simple!,"True plug and play, only one key for the hot key to switch back and forth, great performance--what more could you want? Plug in the keyboard and mouse, plug the included cables into your 2 PC's, and power up the computers. Bingo! You're finished and working. I saw this in a Best Buy and it was waaaaay overpriced, double what you can get it for here. One caveat--the cables are very thick, which is a sign of quality, but they are hard to put exactly where you want them and they really don't lay flat. A minor quibble, and not worth docking the overall rating for."
4,Cannot get it in stores anymore,I grew up using this product. It is great for your skim and keeps it clean. But I can't find this product in stores anymore. I ordered it online and it's great. it worked out great and the delivery was great.
4,Solid speakers,"The bass is surprisingly distinct and clean. Those little treble speakers are really loud for their size. If the quality of an mp3 isn't very high, these speakers will let you know, which is both a good and a bad thing. At 128kbs a song sounds hollow and terrible (but this is more due to the mp3 than the speakers). One small problem is that these speakers, although quality, aren't as loud as other ones in the same price range, so if you really wanted to blast some music from one room to another, you may have some problems. Then again, these are just mid range computer speakers, so one can't expect miracles. $95 from Amazon is about as cheap as you are going to find these (because of free shipping and no tax), but I still think value-wise they could have been about $20 cheaper. Over all, expect to be happy with your purchase."
4,these little speacker are amazing,"I love everything about these speakers, from the very convenient bass and treble adjustment knobs to the touch volume control. When you get the package first thing you will notice is that the speakers are smaller than they look in pictures (in my case this was a good thing). The sound from these speakers is clean and crisp.The little blue leds on the button of the speakers instantly make your desk look twice a cool.Only downside is that there isn't a 5.1 version of these creatures. (But I've got my fingers crossed)"
2,Absolute Junk,"I have always trusted Altec Lansing for decent, affordable PC speakers with a sub, but when I was furnishing my new office, I figured I'd give JBL a try, since they have always been one of my favorites for home use. I can't express my disgust enough...the overall sound wasn't great at all. About a month in, the bass control knob stopped working....anywhere you set it, it gives you maximum bass. I figured out that if I push the knob hard enough, it corrects the problem....so now my ... speakers have scotch tape on the subwoofer, holding the bass knob at an angle. My advice....stay away. Go buy some Altecs."
5,AWESOME!!!!!!,"I must say that I looked for about 4 weeks for speakers, and read about 1000 reviews. After looking at the review on the JBL's I wasn't sure if they would be as AWESOME as people say. After a very short setup, I was listening to the BEST set of speakers EVER. They are 100% amazining, they make my iPod sing! Don't look any more - these are the best speakers around for this price."
4,"Beautiful, but...","This speaker system is truly great looking--even down to the blue light that emanates from it at night. But to my wife's and my ears, the midrange just doesn't compete with my incredible bargain Creative Labs T3000 (roughly $40 and often cheaper with rebates). Still, if you've got an iBook or iMac and care about the visuals, or if you use speakers for gaming and don't care about the timbre of vocal harmonies so much, the Creature is still very good and you can't top the look."
2,Not that good,"After reading all the hot reviews about this speaker system, I decided to replace my AR wedge speakers.The speakers arrived yesterday and I hurriedly connected them, then fired up my MusicMatch. I tried listening to different music and could hardly hear it.. I cranked up all the volume and was dissapointed with how low the volume was. The base was good but the high range was not sparkling. I hooked back my old speakers and turned down the volume and it sounded far better than these creatures. Needless to say, they are on their way back to the shipper."
3,Power supply overheats,"As far as range of sound, this is an excellent and economical system. However, the power supply is risky because it overheats. It gets soo hot that you can barely touch it. I turn it off every night because I'm afraid it might catch fire."
5,Cure vs. Treatment,"This book points out the direction the Medical Industry has taken since the 1920's. It may surprise some to think that money is more important than lives, but Harry Hoxsey outlines the problems of curing patients in the face of an industry bent on making money above all else. Hoxsey's story ended fifty years ago, but his clinic still operates, and the dangers of medical treatment have only gotten worse. Everybody should read this book."
3,A great read,"Unlike the anonymous reviewer who was disenchanted by 'Windflowers', I found the book fascinating and powerful.The descriptions of the outback were as brilliant as I have come to expect from Tamara McKinley - the land is just as I remember it from my travels. The characters were sympathetically drawn and contained just the right balance of pathos, strengh and humour. I applaud the way the story is switched from one persons point of view to another as it asks the reader to get involved with them and share their thoughts. I could not put the book down and can quite understand why it was an immediate best seller in Germany."
4,Gets the job done,"Don't expect miracles, but it gets the job done and leaves the hair better than it was."
5,Great Quick Read on Fil-Am Contributions and Inter-Racial Relations,"I picked up this book because I am a Filipino-American and knew little of the contributions of Filipino-Americans to American society and even had non-Filipino friends tell me of this man and the contributions to the UFW and labor laws in America. It's a sincere story of an honest man who bridged people and cultures and stood up for what was right and worth fighting for. I read it over one weekend and had a hard time putting it down. It's a great read for anyone interested in the UFW, Cesar Chavez, Filipino-American contributions, labor laws, and/or inter-racial relations."
5,fast paced military/court room drama,The main character in this novel is an honorable military officer who chooses to take the right action morally and legally while putting his own career in peril. The book is fast paced with the chapters broken down into hours and days as the action builds up to the final climax in what seems like real time.
3,"CAVEAT EMPTOR: great recording, BOO SONY","The recording is wonderful, but Sony has reissued it without the liner notes or libretto from the original Columbia album!!! I'm writing a term paper and ordered this CD to use as a resource--only to find that Sony, in its infinite wisdom, has declined to include a libretto or translation.ARGH! This is a very annoying trend--especially since one can't just find the libretto on the web, with more modern works, because it can't be made public for copyright reasons.And I repeat, ARGH!"
2,A real slam shutter,"A real shame,this looks to be an interesting fun ride but each and every paragraph contains a landmine of nauseating overcleverness which quickly turns the story into a frustrating wreck.Try again in 10 years."
4,"Tibor, U cold do so much better","This book does have several strengths in that it is eminently readable and outrageously funny. To complain seems a bit curmudgeonly but in the end there isn't much here.It works as a well crafted Hollywood - influenced setpiece but Tibor Fischer seems to have the talent to write a book for the ages. Therefore, while thoroughly enjoyable, this seems in the end altogether disposable...but do buy it if you need cheering up on some rainy afternoon or the other."
5,Absolutely perfect!,"A friend recommended this book to me along with the assurance that I would have the time of my life...now I'm passing the advice along to you! Don't delay! Pick up your copy and begin the ""zaniest"" journey you've ever been on! You won't regret it, I promise, and you'll thank me later..."
2,"Dull, pointless, uninspiring, self-important","As a science writer and reader I was looking forward to this book a great deal. What a disappointment. It trudges along without any humor or fun. It reveals too little about the challenges of building such a remarkable plane and focuses too much on the writers own achievements and accolades. I frequently contemplated giving up before finishing, but I plodded along in hopes it would get better, but it only got worse. I do not recommend this book."
4,A story once told.,"Picked it up from an airport bookstore, needless to say it has been quite an interesting read. I sometimes felt that the book could have been edited better, and gladly feel it as a narrative title rather then a fact filled one. I would recommend this highly to any aviation enthusiast."
3,Not what I expected but still interesting,I thought there would be more of the actually design of an airplane and not so much about the corporate structure that leads to it. Still an interesting look in to one of the great engineering marvels of the 20th century.
4,Helping me with sight reading,"I've played guitar by ear for many years, mostly hard rock. I wanted to expand my repetoire and improve my sight reading. This book helps, there's no tablature so you can't cheat. I've only started the book but there are many continued hours of enjoyment to be had here."
1,Totally Useless - Won't cut anything!,"This thing is totally useless. I couldn't even cut a simple rubber hose. The blade is so dull, I don't think I could cut my finger on it. don't waste your money on this."
3,Ritter Sport Milk Chocolate w/cappucino,"This bar is smooth and creamy like all Ritter Sport bars. When I opened the package, the aroma came wafting up, which was a plus. Actually, this tastes more like amaretto than cappucino, but anyway...It's a tad sweet for my particular taste, but if you like you Ritter, you'll probably like this bar. I prefer the milk chocolate with whole hazlenuts. Doesn't seem quite as sweet."
3,Great lead performance saves it from camp,"Virginia Madsen's surprisingly deep and layered performance shows how much a shame it is that she's not a bigger star, as well as saving this movie from dissolving into camp during the scenes that Candyman spouts his oft-silly dialogue while waving his bloody hook about. In one scene right before the finale, Madsen manages to convey all of Helen's emotions--anger, hurt, betrayal, and hopelessness--all in about five minutes of film time; it is far more powerful stuff than you're likely to see in any horror film as bloody as this.Tony Todd does a good job of being both menacing and sad despite the aforementioned silly dialogue; Candyman is truly a monster that was made, not born.The ending is a bit abrupt and doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but overall this is an above-average horror movie and definitely worth a look."
5,Sweets for the Sweet,"This movie focuses on one emotion and one emotion only: Fear. It gripping, its evil, and its GREAT! I was thumbing through the video store and I saw the picture of the eyeball with the fly in it. I had heard a few things about it so i thought i'd pick it up. I honestly had nightmares for 2 months, I also couldn't sleep that night. Thats how terrifying it was. Sure you all think, well he must be a wuss, trust me, watch this movie, I promise it would make the most fearless human being on earth wet his pants."
4,"Candyman, Candyman, Candyman","This is a very good movie about an Urban Legend, the Candyman.The villian is also a hero, if that makes sense. He was lynchedfor loving a white woman during slavery times. He gets his revenge.I only wished that he picked his vitims in a different way. But he isa very powerful figure, it is nice to see Black Men in this role, noteverything is Jason, Freddy, or the Michael Myers. Way to go, a classicand a must see."
3,Too pretentious to be scary,"I got this DVD on post-Halloween clearance at Kroger's for $5, which is precisely what it's worth. The blood 'n' guts and scary moments are few and far between, replaced by Clive Barker's pretentious BS and constant dreamy close-ups of Virginia Madsen and her amazing cheekbones."
1,Wait...wasn't this Clive Barker?,ruined a good Barker story. turned it into a simple story (say it into the mirror 5 times gimme a break)
3,Weirddd Movie,I watched this when I was much younger and liked it. But I never really understood. So I watched it again. WOW. It is really messed up.
3,This movie's okay,"Urban legend about a killer that strikes when you say ""Candyman"" three times. Some stupid person says it and the Candyman covers up all of his kills by making someone else look guilty. Pretty interesting and stylish flick is spoiled as the pre-ending conflict is REALLY disappointing and the execution is sloppy. Great ending, though. Pizza and Pepsi."
1,YUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"A brilliant story by Clive Barker is turned into a worthless piece of crap film transfer. This movie is so potently disgusting and gory, that you are more revolted than scared. People seem to forget that a movies quality is not based on the amount of gore or blood that spills out of every scene. Its such a shame. If Clive Barker had directed this, it would have been watchable."
3,Unsatisfying,This was good but annoying and it leaves a bad taste in your mouth.In the end you gain nothing from watching a film like this where the script is neither here nor there..
4,Saw it,"I saw it and stood infront of the mirror and said his name 5 times, and nothing happened!! This movie isn't really that scary, It's gotta alot of cheap thrills, but nothing that'll stay with you for very long. The beggining is the only part that messed me up, but other than that it's nothing special, just another slasher. The Ring is the best in new horror, so if you really want to get scared see the ring. Ohe yeah, I watched this movie by myself in the dark, then I went to my mirror and said his name 5 times. Go ahead everyone, do it, nothing happens, although, you'd have to be an idiot to think any could happen, and whats more is you'd have to be an idiot to be afraid of doing it. Basically it is overated."
2,just say my name a cuple of times,candyman...it's a okey movie..not my kind of 'horror' but it's nevertheless a good one...to make this a short one:i think my dog at that time was more scared than i was(it takes a lot to spook moi)...*lol*...just kiddin'..i like the film...i dare you to see it....:p
1,"A strange, bizarre film",For people to say that Candyman is the ultimate in horror genre is being far too generous. I also don't understand why Virginia Madsen wanted to be involved in it. There are some weird scenes which make me think that Clive Baker has a warped imagination. Think of the scene where Virginia Madsen is being burnt.If you say Candyman 5 times infront of a mirror ... that should give you an idea of the silly storyline to the movie.
1,Sick....Not exactly wholesome.....,"This, my dear friend, is one very sick video! It is a thriller/horror, that centres around this myth involving witchcraft and the casting of a spell by speaking the name 'Candyman' whilst looking ast ones' self in the mirror. If repeated three times, the spell is initiated.....If you desire to think on things that are wholesome, pure and of a good report, then please do not even think of watching this video.Not wise to watch if you wish to enjoy a good nights' sleep."
2,not so good,"its very boring,it aint as good as i thought it would have been.the best part of it is definitely how it ends.the public light a pile of wood on fire to kill the candyman but helen is in there aswell.hellen gets killed and then her X-husband goes upto the mirror to repeat her name 5 times then hellen comes to kill him.its not so realistic but its better than hellraiser 4 and upwards. ive tried to call the candyman and in the film they call his name 5 time then turn the lights out then he comes to kill you. the legend is quite interesting but the film is pretty boring,and disappointing.i bought it because it looked good and at first it was ok but wen you watch it more than once it gets sort of boring."
4,The best horror film since HELLRAISER,There is no way you are going to tempt your fate by standing infront of the mirror and saying the word 'Candyman' five times. Another one of Clive Barker's original stories bringing the most unimaginable pain to the screen. No video shelf is complete without a copy of 'CANDYMAN' is complete without a copy of 'CANDYMAN'
3,Enjoyable- ''Be My Victim'',Candyman is a good adaption of a movie from Clive Barker's short story 'The Forbidden'. I don't think any other actress could of played the role of Helen as well as the always beautiful and very gifted Virginia Madsen. The same goes for sensational Tony Todd who was chilling as The Candyman. The musical score chilles me with each viewing. The movies very interesting to watch and should be seen by horror fans if not viewed yet.
5,Wow,"All I have to say is this movie was beautifuly made. You have got to she this. You kinda felt for hellen twords the end the helplessness, and pain. God I love this movie"
1,Perhaps the worst movie of its kind,"This movie is so bad, it is just shocking anyone would give it more than two stars. The special effects are atrocious, but the plot, which could be developed in a way that would have been interesting is just mangled and presented almost in cartoon fashion. The disembodied voice of Candyman is a joke, as is the effect of him just floating stiffly above the university student investigating him. The history of Candyman could have been interesting if it wasn't that he is presented more like a pimp right out of the Starsky and Hutch genre (think Huggy Bear). The movie could work as a comedy, but I don't think that is intentional. The scene at the end is also so immature and juvenile, the script could have been written by a junior high school student. This movie is a dog with fleas and Candyman is about as scary as Huggy Bear was on Starsky and Hutch."
1,The Candyman CAN'T,"How so many can call this movie great is beyond me. The acting is decent, but that cannot make up for the severe boredom you will subject yourself to by watching this film.I fought to stay awake through this poor excuse of a movie hoping it would eventually have moments - it has very few. The ending is beyond predictable. I guess the scary factor might be contributed to the suddenly loud moments waking you up after falling asleep from boredom."
4,ONE OF THE BEST 90'S HORROR MOVIES (PERIOD!!),"CANDYMAN IS AN EXCELLENT HORROR FILM, IT TAKES YOU DEEP INTO THE URBAN LEGEND OF THE MAN WITH THE HOOK BUT REALLY COMES TO LIFE WITH ITS CHILLING PLOT. ITS ALWAYS BEEN A FAVORITE OF MINE COMBINING BOTH, A REAL LIFE FEAR FACTOR AND A STORY LINE THAT DRAWS YOU DEEPER INTO THE HORROR. IF YOU ARE A REAL HORROR FAN OR ARE JUST LOOKING FOR A REAL HORROR MOVIE, TRUST ME THEY DONT MAKE THEM LIKE THIS ANYMORETREADWAY,VA BCH,VA"
3,Kind of lame,Not very scary...My daughter had a slumber party for her birthday we planned on watching scary movies. We only watched a part of it...never finished the entire movie!!! They were bored half way through!!!
4,Mirrors Indeed!,"I have watched many ""horror"" movies, which become either too silly or too gross you can't possibly take them seriously. (Halloween and Scream included, - come on people, get a life!) Yes, I spent many sleepless nights after watching this movie, but mirrors? Come on! This movie left me questioning the definition of insanity. It left me thinking about all the people I have known that were slightly off, and people who think they see things or hear voices - from Joan of Arc to Son of Sam (I can't believe I put those two in the same sentence). True instances of this, are so much creepier than fiction, simply because they are REAL. Candyman, silly plot aside, effectively questions if one persons sanity is anothers insanity."
4,Sweets to the sweet...,"Clive Barker's midas touch is working again as this urban legend is realized to be both real and unreal. This movie cuts deep, so people who ever watched Scream 2 or 3 (Scream 1 was interesting because it was a new twist) should shut the hell up about this horror movie and turn back to horror-trash like ""I Know what your breasts did last summer"". NOTE: Clive reuses his Pinhead-like persona, this time with Tony Todd. Dark force from another form of reality with cool catchphrase."
5,awesome,The Candyman blu ray is a good improvement on the dvd. The image is great and clear. The menu is cool as it shows clips from the film. Each menu is given an icon like the captions and quick to scene. This blu ray is also region free which is a plus. For an import its worth getting. On the downside there are no special features and its not avalibe in the u.s. so importing this is the only to get it.
5,LOVE MY CANDYMAN,"I loved the movie and have since I first seen it. My son that is 16yrs old is the reason I purchased the movie. I don't think that since CandyMan there hasn't been any movie that I can tell you right off the back it was SCARY! Also my son had his friends over one night around 11pm; they started watching the movie and had to turn if off because the boys were getting scared; these are highschool football players.The bees make the movie; makes you feel once you are sleep you are going to have a dream about bees attacking you. I have also always felt that the idea of having to say Candyman 5x's, reminds me of the Bloody Mary story I heard and experienced as a kid in the early 80's"
4,"Candyman, candyman, candyman, candyman....","I like this Horror classic. Starring Tony Todd who i am a fan of. 2 other sexy actresses i like in this film Virgina Madsen and Kasi Lemmons. I really like music made by Philip Glass. Great and scary + atmospheric. Yes, Tony Todd is really great playing Candyman in my opinion.Picture quality: 4/5No reference quality, but it sure does look nicer than the DVDs. Some nice colours, details.Audio quality: 4/5The English audio which is in DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 Dolby Stereo, i must say it sounds pretty good. Some good stereo effects and DEEP bass when Tony Todd speaks. The music actually benefits from this lossless audio and sounds improved.Film: 4.5/5Overall: 4/5candyman."
4,Superior plot line for a low budget film,"Well made, well acted, Tony Todd is always good, he should do more of this type of movie. Virginia Madsen is also always good I wonder why she's not a big movie star? She certainly has the looks, figure and talent. I enjoyed this movie because the plot was very different and not run of the mill like most horror movies. Enjoy!"
4,movie monster for the ages,"This is one of the finest tragic monster movies ever made. Based on Clive Barker's ""The Forbidden"", it tells the tale of a ghost whose only means of survival is to live in the rumors of the community. His legend is his life. This eternal life is threatened by a non-believer, Helen, whom he must convince of his reality.The movie takes the plot one step beyond the story, adding elements of racism, urban blight, and tragic love. The Candyman's need to survive is only surpassed by his loneliness.Overall, a truly scary film with a wonderful score and hauntingly good dialogue. The big problem with this DVD is the lack of special features. It is nice to have the normal/wide screen option, and a trailer is always welcome, but what about commentary? Perhaps a featurette or two?"
4,Don't look in the mirror,"Tony Todd at his most menacing. Given its low budget, it manages to be much scarier than many glossy horror movies, and has several top quality shock scenes. You can almost smell the grime oozing from the blocks of flats, and the protagonists descent into her own personal hell is very well handled.It succeeded in spooking me so much that I gave myself a fright looking in the mirror on the way to bed"
4,solid horror flick,"as horror movies go,this one is pretty good.it's from the imaginationof Clive Barker.it's basically a movie about an urban legend involvingthe title character,and one woman's research into urban legends andfolklore.without giving anything away,she gets way more than shebargained for.The character of Candyman is certainly creepy,and themovie has a very good atmosphere.the acting is good and Tony Todd isterrific in the title role.there are some real eerie moments.the onething i didn't like was i thought the violence was too excessive.themovie is not groundbreaking or anything,but still,i enjoyed it.i don'tthink it as good as another Clive Barker creation,Hellraiser,which ithought was groundbreaking.for me,Candy man is a 4/5"
2,Been waiting to see this one but...,"I love horror movies and this was one of the few that I haven't seen. The acting was okay, but the pacing was slow and it really didn't live up to the hype at all. Rent it first as I did."
3,Slow horror,"This is an overated, slow horror film with 2 boring sequels. I thought Clive Barker the creator of NIGHTBREED and HELLRAISER could make a good film, but I guess when he did this he was having a bad day. The only thing I liked was the lovely Virginia Madsen. PHWWOARRR!"
3,How do you make an urban thriller?,"Certainly not like this! Too much weight was on the slicing end and not enough on the true chills.Virginia Madsen and Tony Todd are excellent, as always. The story has potential, but they missed the mark somewhere. The scenes where The Candyman is haunting Madsen's character are very good, but short-lived. More attention should have been paid to these scenes and less to the blood and gore.Much better gore-fests are out there with better developed stories.... I recommend... ANY of them."
2,Not What You Think,"I remember the old reviews of this movie which was once called, ""The scariest movie since Silence of the Lambs."" That reviewer must not watch many movies...and this must have been the first one they watched since watching Silence of the Lambs. This movie is not only NOT scary (even by older standards) I cringe at the idea that it is called a ""horror classic,"" This IS NOT a horror movie. A psychological thriller, maybe, but not a horror movie. Actually it would be a three-four star psych-thriller, but don't bill a movie as something it's not. This was a HUGE disappointment."
4,they tried to make art but made something different,"You have to like a movie that rips off from the artiest movie of them all, Koyannasqatsi (my video guidebook says Phillip Glass did the music and you can tell if you know ""Koy...""). Its a cheesily pretentious fun movie, but its not very scary or eeire. It proves that Clive Barker really doesn't know how to scare anyone, but his movies are still ok... way better than Jason X !"
1,Thanks Candyman!,"Thanks to you, I vomited, and I went to the hospital, dont get me started people, cause im not kidding, this movie is sooooo gross (And yes im a fan of horror movies) but when I saw this man opening his chest (It was full of bees and it was full of blood, it looked real...) it was gross and I was throwing up cause of his fault, I couldnt eat meat for like a week, thank you! Avoid this movie at all cost!"
3,"Good product, yet over-advertised","It's a good product,does exactly as I hoped it would.Kinda hard to mount it by itself on a wall, like I had planned to do in the bathroom above the toilet. Also it was EXTREMELY smaller than what I was led to beleive by the advertisements and pictures of the product.But in teh end the product performs pretty well and is great for referencing, which is exactly what I use it for. Especially when none of my clocks are in-synch."
4,Mini-wheats worth eating,I have found the Cinnamon Streusel Mini wheats to be an invigorating change to the normal breakfast cereal. A good product that is recommended by my taste buds
3,How much of life does this really represent?,"I lived in Kenya for almost four years, and visited Tanzania while I was there. I can say that I did see the side of East Africa which is depicted, including- awful, awful conditions for street children.- a class / race system which went European, then ""Asian"" (Indian) then African- the worst sort of foreigners coming in and grabbing what they could, including money and women.But what I remember most were the positives, and I don't see them reflected in this..."
3,Great Documentary poor quality DVD,"The documentary (I saw at the NY Film Festival a few years ago), was excellent and memorable prompting me to purchase the DVD. However, something seems to be missing in the dvd; perhaps the inadequate subtitles or the quality of the sound recording because I found it a strain to comprehend the dialogue during most of the film."
1,Don't waste your money on this!,"I am a yoga instructor and I bought this DVD hoping to gain insights to teach to beginning students. This DVD is NOT a real yoga session and the word yoga should not even be in the title! What I did see was a woman who was very flexible, quite possibly a dancer, doing a workout routine that incorporated some yoga movements. In most of the movements she taught, this instructor was hyperextended and moving in very fast repetitive motion.Pass this one up!"
3,"Intro to Yoga: Gentle, for Extreme Beginners","This is a good non-stressful workout. Very much about stretching and reaching - no pounding or jumping. I like the exercises. The music is blah, but the outdoor setting is nice. The instructor goes very slow - this would be good for someone older as well. I like it."
1,Boring in the extreme,"This video is a poorly-filmed, self-promoting, monotonous waste of money. And that's the ""polite"" version of my opinion. This DVD does not inspire me to do anything but shut it off before it annoys me further. It's a very long stretching session with almost no real yoga, and the ""meditation"" session is frankly jarring with these clanging bells that snap you out of any good place in which you might have had your mind.Try YogaZone or any other beginners' yoga, but not this one."
1,NOT YOGA AT ALL,"This is a scam and a rip-off. This is a DVD of someone going through some motions, but not yoga. I wouldn't even call it calisthenics. Even a complete couch potato expends more energy than this woman does. Please don't be fooled by the title - even the most extreme of beginners deserve more than what this woman is offering. If I can give this a rating less than 0 stars I would."
2,"Introduction to Yoga: Gentle, for Extreme Beginners","Very disappointing. If this is for beginners, I wonder what a DVD for ""experts"" would be like. The rhythm of the movements was too fast, and the sound was not at all soothing, which to me is the essence of Yoga. Perhaps I didn't know what to expect since I have never taken any yoga classes. But that was my purpose in ordering this ""beginning"" Yoga DVD--too learn the basics and the ""feel"" of Yoga."
1,Got a dud.,"I ordered this DVD. The program looked like it was what I was looking for esepecially after I read the reviews. Unfortunately the DVD I received is garbled and defective. I received an email after I complained to Amazon that a new DVD would be shipped to me. However, I never received anything. I would think twice about ordering. You might get defective merchandise as well."
5,Excellent Resource for Aspiring Trainers!,"This is an excellent source, full of useful advice on the ins and outs of putting together a dog training business. It does not go into training techniques, so you'll definitely need other books on methodology along with this one, which is strictly business. I think she's a bit conservative in her advice, which is probably necessary to publish and avoid liability. However, it can be a little discouraging to think that ALL OF THAT is necessary - just realize, it may not be. But it certainly has EVERYTHING you need!"
4,So You WAnt To Be A Dog Trainer,"This book is beyond awesome... I actually sat down and read it in only a couple sittings. It is very plainly written, but it covers SO much! Nicole Wilde goes on to explain things that I never would have thought about on my own - that is until I run into it, because it is stuff for sure that I will eventually, and I just would not have been prepared! The book has pages of resources and recommended readings. I think this book is all around a great buy for someone looking to go into this field. She went right down into talking about advertising and contracts! I highly recommend this book!"
3,It was pretty good.,"This book offered some good information for people looking to get into training dogs professionally. I thought that many of the ideas for advertising were helpful. The downside was the author's push of her own training methods. This book is made to seem like a book about helping people get started and learning the business aspects of a dog training business, but there is definitely an agenda to push her ""purely positive"" methods which becomes frustrating after a while. Read it if you want the information on the business part, but be prepared to have to deal with the pushing of questionable training methods."
1,Ezzo + Women = disaster,"I'm sorry there's no zero star option.Isn't it bad enough that babies routinely get sick and are diagnosed as Failure To Thrive because of Ezzo's ridiculous and unfounded infant feeding advice?? Isn't it bad enough that Ezzo has no credentials or degrees in anything whatsoever (except for that ministry degree that included credit for ""life experience"") including no credentials in medicine of any kind? Isn't it bad enough that pregnant and birthing women already die in alarming numbers in the United States, more than in any other industrialized nation? Do Gary Ezzo and his wife really need to write this book, in light of all that? Give me a break!For more information on this crooked and dangerous author, see http://www.ezzo.info"
1,NO!!!!!!,"Do NOT buy this book. This man is an idiot and is a danger to you and your child. If you need a birth book check out ""Birthing From Within"" or ""Ina May's Guide to Natural Childbirth."" Dr. Sears also has some excellent books. Following Ezzo's advice is on the verge of child abuse!!!"
3,Read the books before you make judgments,I just wanted to state that Ezzo DOES NOT say to not feed your child. People posting against the Ezzos should make sure they READ the books before criticizing them.
5,The Ezzo's have a great common sense book,"I've raised both my children according to the babywise recommendations. They not only slept thru the night, but are amazing children. Brilliant, healthy, compassionate. The Babywise series is all about empowering the parents to make positive choices for their children. I also benefited from 'Parenting with Love and Logic'. As with anything, read the book and make your own decision. Please do not let all these illogical, irrational reviews deprive you of your opportunity to do what is best for you and your child. To the rest of the reviewers...Grow Up!"
1,Hello.what happen to common sense,This is the worst pregnancy book I have EVER seen. I'm a trained childbirth educator and this guy has no clue about birth. DONT waste your time or money on this. After seeing this book I started researching this Ezzo guy and I can't believe people are reading his child abuse. I have the sickest feeling in my gut about him. Pure Evil!!
1,HORRIBLE-DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This man is a quack. After reading advice that was contradicted by my Ob/Gyn and Pediatrician, I performed a google search and found this website: http://www.ezzo.info/I found out that several woman and children have been harmed and almost died from his advice. He is not a doctor and does not even have a masters degree. Why is he writing about things he knows nothing about? Please do not buy this, and warn your friends."
1,"Don't bother! If I could give it a MINUS star, I would!",This man is one sick puppy. Don't bother buying this trash or any of the other garbage he spews. He is the devil incarnate.
1,Steer Clear Of This!,"This is a scary man with scary ideas. Do yourself a favor and look within to your *own* heart for guidance as to how to birth, not to that of a man so conspicuously hard-hearted. Women have delivered babies for millenia -- not always easily, perhaps, but we've done it -- and you can too. But not with advice from this man."
1,regurgitation,"What is factual in this book is redundant of better-written books. This book is not supportive of breastfeeding. The theological underpinnings are unfounded and, frankly, ill thought out and inconsistent. The Ezzos were kicked out of their church, don't forget."
1,Run far and run fast.,"Anything written by this man should be removed from bookstore shelves! He has no medical background to make a basis for any of his claims, and his other books are textbook on how to break your childs spirit, I can only imagine his take on birthing. If I could give negative stars, I would!!"
1,Educate yourself with a real resource,Try a real birth book like _A Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth_ by Henci Goer. Goer's book won't tell you how to parent your child. It just evaluates all the studies out there and gives you the best info possible to make the decisions you need to make.
1,One of the worst books I have ever read,"I took a chance and read this book despite having hated Ezzo's previous books (On Becoming Babywise).I wasted my time and money.Ezzo clearly doesn't understand the first thing about pregnancy, birth, breastfeeding or baby care. He should be banned from writing on such topics.Please don't waste your money or time reading this trash. Even the What To Expect series, which I didn't care for at all, were better and more medically sound than this book.Two huge thumbs down."
1,Run don't walk from this book,"Scary..just scary.If you'd like a birth book, you would do well to consider ""THE BIRTH BOOK"" by Dr. Sears. Anyone who writes such counterintuitive, dangerous; and woefully misinformed trash as Ezzo should probably stay away from life-changing, momentous events that affect you and your child for the rest of your natural lives."
2,"Mistitled: Should be Pregnancy, Birth and Infancy ""Wise""","I picked up this book because I saw the subtitle ""Birth by Design"" and am always enthralled to see books that actually accentuate women taking a primary or at least partnership role with the caregiver in bringing their child through the birth process.Unfortunately, the book covered very little about the birth process itself.In fact, that is the primary short coming of this book: everything is very minimal, clinically written and dry.I was very disappointed to say the least."
3,Deb Harry is the bomb!,"Deb Harry's introduction to the book is the best thing about it: short, sharp, sexy. The Courtney Love chapter is more of the same self-indulgent, ego-maniacal drivel you've come to expect. The Bjork chapter is a must read! She's original, & her happy-go-lucky attitude is so refreshing."
4,Oh no.. Courtney Love,"My admiring words for this book are going to be cut short by the fact that the Courtney Love/Hole chapter focuses more on a self absorbed look at music rather than the larger. However, this peep into women in rock will leave you wanting more. You'll want to go listen to Liz Phair and change your world."
3,America's Wildest Bachelor Parties Better,"Very cool premise for a video, nude girls playing basketball, but the camera work has you in the cheap steats. The master shots were way to far away for my taste. This needed more close ups of the hot babes. For close up nudity i suggest checking out America's Wildest Bachelor Parties."
2,If you are only dying to see naked women.,"Normally, I watch adult tapes like Hot body. But, I don't have much to say because everyone has complained before me. I think people didn't mention is that most of the time we buy tapes so 80% of the time we could see a fully or bikini clothed beauty take it all off. But, in this Nude Basketball tape you won't. At first the girls are already topless introducing themselves. When they start to play they are already Naked. This tape could have been like each 10 points the team loses a top or something. But we watch totally naked girls bouncing BALLS! and hopefully they could attract their viewers to SCORE! This tape is defintely for adults who just want to spend 50 mins of seeing what I described above."
2,BINOCULARS REQUIRED...,"If all you want is to see some girls nude, then I guess you may be satisfied. If you'd like to see interesting camera work or closeups of individual girls running and dribbling from one end to the other of the baksetball court (its really a tennis court with hoops about 7 ft up)...if you'd like these things, they will not be there. looks like it was filmed with 2 cameras, placed in awkard postions. A lot of ""head swinging"" may get you sea sick. gets 2 stars only because picture quality is pretty good. This was a rough draft, not a finished product. Truth be told."
2,"Bad, very bad","If you're looking for some real sexy sports don't look here. Yeah, there's full nudity, but it's not at all sexy. Let me put it this way. It's silly! If you want silly girl action that melts your mind into useless liquid grey matter and does nothing for your other regions, by all means buy this video."
2,Technical,"If you are an Art therapist, then maybe this book is for you. If you are an artist, wishing to expand your creativity - this book will not be much help. I was expecting examples, excercises, and lots of visual stimulation, but was very much disappointed. The book is mainly all text, with very little visuals, and very technical, not user friendly at all. I sent it back. The cover looks very intriguing, but the content is flat."
4,Harry Potter hard to find toy!,"Cute toy, my boys HAD to get this. We missed it when it first came out, they were too little for the small pieces. Wish I had bought these playsets then when the prices were lower, but glad to finally find it. Seller shipped very fast and my boys are excited to add this piece of Harry Potter playset to their castle."
5,"Easy to mount, keeps TV close to the wall!","I purchased this mount after looking at the one Circuit City sold me with my 42"" Panasonic Plasma. It was going to add almost 3"" to the overall depth from the wall. I wanted something a with less clearance (I wanted my TV close to the wall, and this holds it 1.25 inchs from the wall when mounted), and this did the trick. You are limited to flat mount or 5 degrees, but that is fine or most home installs. The mount was sturdy, and we lagged it to three studs, which the mount easily hit.With 5 degrees of tilt, we had enough room above the mount to add the surge protector and feed the wires thru the wall. I suggest planning out where you will mount this, mark it out, make your hole and place your box to feed the wires, then attach the mount to the wall.Overall, good quality, keeps the TV close to the wall, and easy to use. For the price, you can't beat it! I returned the one I had purchased at Circuit City today, and got my $250 back!"
5,Excellent,I ordered this based on the other review.I was completly satisfied. The mounting was easy and very stable. I like the way it holds the tv close to the wall.I defintely recommend this product.
4,Close fitting wall mount,This wall mount put the TV closer to the wall than any other the others. It was exactly what I was looking for. There is very little room behind the TV though so you have to make sure your plug will fit and getting your hand back there is near impossible. It took 3 people to hand the TV (2 to hold and one to hook & lock). Now that it is set up it is great though.
5,VMPL2B,"This mounting system was easy to install and all of the necessary hardware was provided. Very satisfied with all aspects of this purchase (quality, delivery, value, etc...)."
5,Great!,"Lots of great photos, which is what I wanted! Some text that is interesting and just enough to compliment the visuals."
3,holster type,"The holster that i recieved was not the one in the picture, but it was the right one for my phone."
4,Astralasia - 'Somewhere Something' (Transient),"Looks to be the long-running trance-techno band's ninth effort. I personally know others that are supposedly HUGE fans of Astralasia - however this is only the second title of theirs I've listened to, myself. Liked what they have to offer - dug ""Prophecy Of Life"", ""Out There"", the fantastic ""Sweet Something"" and ""Shine"". Should do a lot for fans of Eat Static, The Orb, Loop Guru and possibly Banco de Gaia."
2,I was disapointed,"I loved Zabelle...one of the few books that I cried like a baby after reading, but this latest one left me with a feeling that it was not complete. If you liked Zabelle and have an interest in the Armenian genocide then please do yourself a big favor and read ""Rise the Euphrates"" as beautiful and painful book as Zabelle."
4,"The kids love it, but beware small pieces!","My boys just had to have this playset, and I was lucky enough to find it for a reasonable price here on AMAZON. The seller was great, shipped very fast and packed it well. The playset itself is fun for the kids, although it is NOT for small kids because it has little pieces and is made of a plastic that will break easy. This is very hard to find but we have the castle and most of the other sets and really needed this one to complete the set. My favorite piece is the spider web!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS RECORDER- IT'S HORRIBLE!,"I hate this thing! The instructions are not clear, it took all day to set it up. The remote is too small and the printing on it even smaller! I practiced recording a few things here and there and had it set to record the season opener of ""24"" and checked on it- all was well, it said it was recording, it looked good, after the show it was ""ERROR"" and now the thing says it is an ""unknown disc"" and will not play it or even recognize it. The disc was brand new, from the same package as the one I practiced with, I have no idea what went wrong. And now when my sister gets back from Iraq she will not have the season opener as I promised. I hate this thing!! Do not waste your time or money on it. This was a TRUTECH 1620- stay away from it."
3,Haven't succeeded recording yet,"I bought the TruTech DVD recorder over 6 months ago but didn't try it out right away. If I had of with the current results I would return it. I am trying to record from analog videos. Maybe I need a special cable. I am not able to find my instruction booklet, all I have is the one page cable hook-up sheet. I even had my 18 year old try it with no success. It just keeps indicating 'LOAD' on the recorder. I have tried -R and +R/RW discs but it still indicates 'LOAD'. Does anyone have any suggestions?"
4,I love wearing this perfume,"I got this with my other bottle of design, but are nice smelling got them quick, but they both smell a little weak"
2,Overpriced,This product is Hackleback Sturgeon roe which is very good. The problem I have with the supplier is that it is over priced. One maypurchase this product from Marky's Caviar-- the exact same caviar from Markys for a little over 43 dollars for 2 oz not 64 dollars for 1 oz.The shipping for this product is also outrageous. If you like this product which I did get the most for your money from Marky's Caviar andforget Charleston Seafood. I had even called Charleston and they were not able to help me when confronted with the facts so poorcustomer service.
4,"Persuasive, gutsy, and to the point!","James Sanders provides detailed facts, and his own theory about what happened on the ground, in the water, in the surrounding air space, and aboard doomed Flight 800 on that fateful eveing.His argument is sound and persuasive, but as with any theory, it must be scrutinized carefully. What is great about this book is that Sanders asks the same of the government's theory . . . why don't more people scrutinize what Washington is force-feeding us about this incident.A good, fast read with pictures of some evidence in the middle of the book."
3,Author raises some interesting questions about the crash.,"As you can see, I still have doubts about the validity of some of the evidence. The author claims throughout the book that the plane was shot down by the U S Navy through an accident. As evidence, he cites the ""missle residue"" on the seat cushions on certain rows, and the presence of a military drone and spy aircraft in the area. He discounts the center fuel tank spark. For this to be a proper investigation, the author should have provided evidence of why the counter theories were wrong and his right. All he screams is cover-up and the harassment of his wife and himself through federal evidence tampering.I don't know if the author is right, but he does bring up relevant questions which should be answered. If the reader is interested in this accident (shoot down), then this book plus other relevant books would be a place to start."
3,It's a shocking example of first amendment violation!,"For it's literary content, the book is as exciting as any cliffhanger. I stayed up all night. Many of his conclusions have proven true over the last few years, and some have contradictory evidence but, the most amazing events are the violation of free press which our government commited. Whether his theory is correct or not the main message is, ""Don't you citizens DARE try to investigate the US Navy!"""
3,It's A Brave New World,"We live in a different world today. Our President, on television, says he did not have sex with 'that woman'. We need to look carefully at everything we're told by our government. Did anyone notice the recent leaking out that an Italian airliner that 'crashed' 16 years ago was really brought down by a NATO plane shooting at a Libyan jet that had entered Italian airspace? Stonewalling works for a while, but eventually (hopefully) truth wins out. Witnesses see an object rise in the sky; an 'anomalous' radar blip at the right time and place; and a photo of a missile-like object. And we're to believe these are all coincidences, errors and not relevant? Read this book. I'm not sure if it has all the right answers, but it at least looks at the right clues."
1,Gaming the series,"If this book is part of the same series that Mastering the French/Spanish/Nimzo-Indian represent then it is a very poor sibling. The amount of information is minimal and what's there is not very instructive. If you bought this book in the expectation that it follows the pattern of the other Mastering the XXX books you will be very disappointed.As a survey of Sicilians it has some value though. Not a total waste, but disappointing."
2,Non-replacable batteries,"I like my trimmer, but be warned, when the internal batteries die, a perfectly good trimmer is not usable. Batteries can't be replaced, and it can't run corded."
5,Absolutely Fascinating!,"Alan Baker covers just about every side of ufology, obviously well thought out and researched. This book is what really got me into the subject of alien encounters and abductions, and it's a great intro to anyone just getting into the idea of ufos and aliens. A definite must-read!"
4,For those who enjoy a good Sci Fi book,"In this very good story, we can feel a big influence of Star Trek, since it's an awesome and advanced ship with dinamic crew, and some really look like Kirk, McCoy and cia. The sea is their final frontier, and a ravaged new world is their ""where no man has gone before"". A good balance between action, mistery and both together makes this a worth reading sci-fi novel, and makes you looking forward to reading the next chapters."
1,I can't belive I sat through this...,"My mom rented this at the library because I have a friend who is ""into"" horses. Afterward, we turned it off and my dad went ""There was a reason that was at the library."" Ugh! The acting was horrible the ""dangerous villian"" wasn't that deadly- and the rapids were a little trickle.Ohh. Intense.My brother watched it again because it was so bad. Save your money- don't buy it."
3,Written Long Ago In A Galaxy Far Far Away,"I'm not always quick on the update, so I've struggled with this book. I think the text is reasonably clear, if a little dense. The real issue is the typography -- it's relatively small print and clearly not written using modern technology. This is the 2nd edition, published in 1999, but I'm not sure how much it was actually revised from the original 1970's text. I'm not sure I can recommend it, though I haven't found a better alternative that costs less than my monthly car payment."
4,Balance trainer,Great product. Pleased to discover it's perfect for proper posture when sitting. Will get two more for various chairs.
3,Plates are great - Cup is fragile,"The plate and bowl are very nice and have withstood frequent falls to the ground from my 20 month old twins; however, the cup is very fragile and cracked the first time it was dropped from the highchair onto our tile kitchen floor. If you can find the plate and bowl separately, skip the cup. It should be made from a more flexible plastic. None of our sippy cups have ever cracked like this. We do use the plate every day for dinner, though, and my girls just love it. It is also dishwasher safe on the top rack. Cute set, but wish the cup was made better. An older child might be fine with it, but not a younger toddler."
4,informative,"Ten Thousand Miles Without A Cloud is the first book by Sun Shuyun. It details Sun's experience as she tries to follow in the footsteps on Xuanzang, a Buddhist monk who, in the 7th century, made a pilgrimage through Central Asia and into India, to find the original sutras of the Buddha. Xuanzang made his trip during a time of political unrest, as does Sun; both confront obstacles and both come to understand Buddhism and themselves better for their encounters with others on the way. I found myself checking how many pages left and eyeing my next read with increasing frequency as the book progressed: never a good sign! Readers interested in Buddhism would find this book informative and enjoyable; readers with less of a fascination might find it somewhat repetitive and a bit slow. All those Chinese and Indian gods and historical figures had my eyes glazing over, but I did learn a few noteworthy facts. This was not my first choice of Sun's books: I still hope to read A Year in Tibet."
3,"Golden Age mystery entertains, just","An okay example of the mystery story of the 1940's, this is -- at least -- not as outlandishly complicated as many of the Ellery Queen tales are. It has some surprises, but the solution isn't that great a shock. OK, but nothing special."
3,8 Songs?,"Ilove Sawyer Brown. Energetic, fun, and Mark Miller is the best frontman of the last 20 years, regardless of genre. But 8 songs? Gimme a break! And then it gets interrupted by (the record company no doubt) rolling out some pretty boy looking for a breakthrough. Dam shame, cuz the music (albeit brief) is awesome, and sounds great on home theatre. Coulda shoulda done much better on this one."
4,Where can I find this Sawyer Brown video?,A few years ago I saw a Sawyer Brown video performed with a church choir on TV. I really did like it and I wonder if anyone knows if it is available for purchase on a DVD or VHS? I can't remember the song's name.
2,An actionless book,"Ned Wallis is a boy who shot a gun that was not his yet. He shot a shadow; it turned out to be a cat. In the small town in New York Ned is the minister's son with a big secret. This book One Eyed cat is not bad. it is very realistic because everything could have happened, like shooting a cat and taking a gun. There should have been more to this book and it is boring. It was very very easy to understand and there are no confusing things like names and places. Overall this book is boring but ok to read. I give it two out of five stars. Comparing it to another book like Trouble On The Tracks, Trouble On the Tracks is way better. It is very exciting unlike One Eyed Cat and gets four stars out of five. Trouble On the Tracks is a interesting and exciting book unlike the boring book One Eyed Cat."
1,Extremely Boring,"The book oNe-eyed cat is about a boy who shoots a cat in the eye and has guilts about it. This book was terribly put together and had no plot what so ever. I flunked my reading test on this book because it was so boring, it went through one ear and out the other. I do not reccomend this book. It would have been netter if there was more action other than a little boy shooting a cat in the eye and hoping he wont get in trouble."
4,Hard to pick up but interesting,"As I said, the story's hard to pick up (because of the long paragraphs which capture the details well... too well...), but it progresses (?) and the story becomes more interesting. The story actually feels more realistic with the details (I know I'm always going on about so-called reality), even if they are boring to read (if you feel that way).The plot itself is interesting enough. The one-eyed cat may not have done much in the story, besides earning the interest of Ned, Mr. Scully and the readers, but it really is a good story.Reading the book... it felt long, slow, but interesting."
2,I THOUGHT THAT THE BOOK WAS NOT DEVELOPED WELL.,I felt that the One-EyedCat was OK. But they did not tell a whole lot about the cat. Perhaps it was not developed properly.
2,OEC Review,"One-Eyed Cat is about a kid named Ned Wallis who shoots a cat with an air-rifle and eventually confesses.This book is another novel centered around the main character's guilt for doing a wrong. I found it to be very dull and distasteful, as I have already had my own real-life struggles with similar topics. I didn't relate well to the characters, either.I wouldn't recommend reading this book. I think it is boring and that there are better books to read."
4,This book should not be put down.,"I would recommend this book for you to read. I think you should this book because it has a real life story that can/could happen. It has great descriptive details. When I was reading it, I could hardly put it down. It was an awesome reading expreience. The story told about what an 11 year old boy would do to tell his parents about a situation that happened. He accidently did something and it was hard for him to decided whether or not to tell about shooting a cat in the eye. I learned that it is important to tell your parents things, even if it is hard to do so."
1,Grossly out of Date & Inconsistent,"While maybe at one time this book used to be valid today it is grossly out of date and there are multiple inconsistentsies in the first several chapters that would not make this a great 'how to' and a great beginners book anymore.The electrical section fails the current check, the couplers they recommend haven't been made by the company mentioned in over 15 years, and many other things."
4,How to for Beginners,"Really rates four and one half stars, the missing half star because a small amount of out of date material recommended in construction.For the beginner who needs a hand-holding step by step guide to building a first layout, from basic to more complex, this book is the one to choose. Simplicity and use of common materials is stressed. I wish the authors would update this volume, for I would be first in line to buy it."
5,N Scale Model Railroad that Grows,"This book finally got me into model railroading after 15 years of procrastinating. The authors present an easy, light-weight way to make a train layout. Because of the foam core construction, the board can easily be moved from room to room when necessary. And it doesn't take a special stand to support it - any table, etc will do. It is true this type of material would not be durable enough for a larger layout, but it is fine for N Scale.Their tips and techniques for laying track, wiring, and making scenery are excellent. Want to build a mountain, or a forest, or a lake? They tell you how. And anyone can make a fine model railroad just by following their instructions (I did!).So, if you are looking for a way to do a train layout without permanently setting aside part of your house, or if you are looking for all sorts of neat tips on scenery, structures, track laying, etc, this book is just what you need. I highly recommend it."
2,Mediocre,"I must have been reading a different book because this was dissapointing. Nothing is explained about the guardians of the time machine until the very end and even then its vague at best. I would have love to know what the civil war in the future was about but it wasn't gonna happen in this book. Yeah, a change in weather forced everybody on eastern coast to move inland and we have a civil war? Oh, common, a little more than that ridiculous explanation was definately needed. And then, we have the killer himself-other than going on about how bad things are in the future, no details are given about what is it exactly so bad. Oh, wait, no building is heated. Geez."
3,Interesting but unexciting SF,"It's perhaps unfair to give this book only 3 stars. After all, it's imaginative, *very* well-written, and consistent. It presents one of the better reasoned time-travel setups that I've seen (and I've seen a lot).But too much of it is taken up with the rather timid adventures of basically a loser character. The people in the novel, confronted by nanotechnology that basically can restore life, and with time-travel, somehow manage to care more about their everyday lives and remaining petty. In a short story I could accept that, but in a novel it really drags. The antagonist, here a cyber-symbiosis dependent future conscript, is golem-like, unlikable and also under-achieving.If you like low-IQ people lost among marvels, this may be the one for you. For me... three stars."
3,"Get's good, then they run","It's a fair amateur production. Although, most of the outside footage is difficult to see and they need auxiliary lightning units on their night vision cameras. The last investigation gets really interesting, but just as they get something that seems to really freak them out, they run away and it ends abruptly with no credits or anything.I would view more of their stuff in the future, but I hope that they get better lightning units and stick around instead of running away. I liked it better than Dead House. Keep them coming team.Again, I like that I could see how other investigate without having to sit in on the investigation."
2,"good player, bad customer rep","this player could be the best, has lots of functions, but after a couple months, the thing started having problems such as can't play songs, or it freezes up. Those occurred every other week or so, but now it doesn't let me add songs nor write any firmware. Called Samsung customer service and the supervisor said ""we only sell you the product, the problem is yours not ours"""
1,Wonderful - while it works!,"The player is stylish, compact, has decent sound, and is easy enough to use. However, after two weeks it wouldn't operate. I couldn't access the menus, music wouldn't play, and the player was no longer recognized by my computer. It went right back to Amazon!!Stay away from this one..."
2,Not With Audible You Wont.......,"I bought this unit to use with Audible downloads. After receiving the unit and trying to get Audible to recognize it I discovered that they are NOT compatible (pays to do your homework FIRST). The screen is dull when displaying pictures and the joy stick seems to be unpredictable, working some of the time and other times ignoring the control."
5,Definately THE BEST!!!!!!,"I received it Yesterday and I have to admit it was soo much easier than learning how to store info on my Cell phone!!My pictures are vivid, My Music sound-is Superb!!! I couldn't believe how much this tiny thing PACKED A HUGE PUNCH!!!At first I was debating between the i-Nano or this and I'm VERY pleased I choose this. It also includes a belt clip & a necklace holder so if you're an ""on the go"" person who DOESN'T like big clunky things then this is perfect!!!Also, I hooked it up to my old computer Labtec speakers at work and the SOUND WAS SUPER CLEAR.. Its even better than when my comupter is hooked-up to these old speakers..for a moment I thought someone switched my speakers!! I still can't get over the quality of this product... SAMSUNG has definately done an AWSOME job!!! My co-worker actually bought the I-Nano and it ended up bending in her pocket... so go figure... You won't be sorry with the price and the quality of this product!!!"
1,"If you are a runner, look elsewhere -","If you run, & sweat when you run, this unit will NOT hold up. Samsung will tell you it is designed for sport enthusiasts...it is not. This MP3 (1 year) malfunctioned due to 'Water Damage' resulting from perspiration...not caught in the rain, not dropped in the sink. It is not repairable, not honored by the warrantee, and Samsung basically washes it's hands because of their own poor quality casing design. Guess I'll be 'running' to have better luck with an iPod..."
2,This wasn't self-published?,"Ignoring the improbabilities of the plot, which have been covered by other reviewers, this book just wasn't edited, or even proofread, very well. Someone please explain to the author that ""incredulous"" does not mean ""incredible."" And take the thesaurus away from her! In places, it looked like she went through a list of synonyms simply to make her prose sound a little more interesting. Two stars because the plot had possibilities (I can suspend disbelief better than some reviewers I guess). It wasn't carried out very well. Glad I paid less than a buck!"
1,I daresay it could be better,"I wanted to like this one but I just couldn't. I found the repetition of pseudo-historical catchphrases, like ""I daresay"" (often used incorrectly) and ""pray."" annoying. The plot also irritated me. It depended on the unlikely situation of four brothers, determined to protect their sister from any men who might be interested in her, sending her to be cared for by a man widely held to be a rake. Sure they would!From then on the plot lurched from one improbable event to the next. In the end I was so fed up with the whole thing, I didn't finish it...and there are not many books I can say that about. I had not read anything from this author before, and I won't attempt to again."
4,Awesome,"Loved it. Doesn't even really need a review. Rose Gordon is awesome, her characters are awesome and she writes beautifully. Just buy the damn book and be happy."
1,sadly disappointed,"I had high hopes for the story, especially when the wolf and the fox spies were mentioned. But the main character's credibility as a spy who was shot in the line of duty is thrown out the window every time the has to be rescued by the earl from an unwanted suitor. By god, how could she be a spy when she is almost trampled to death at a local fair. I read a lot of novels and even I know that strange men coming in your window spells trouble. Where is any indication that she can even attend a ball without needing rescuing from a man. The lamest spy cover story ever."
1,terrible!,"Wow - I have rarely read such a terrible book. I am very surprised that anyone would rate this story above a 2 but I guess to each his or her own. The plot has already been discussed. One of my problems was that everyone, with the exception of Jared, was just not likeable. Emily. IU mean please, a spy of sorts and her Aunt, too? Just not credible. And Emily's brother, the duke, just a real jerk along with the rest of the brothers and his romance with Jane was like what romance? Since when is yelling and frowing and disliking someone a romance! Jared's reason for keeping his little girl a secret was realistic and if Emily or the Aunt was smartly involved in spying, etc, well, she should have understood. And what was with Lord B. who wanted to marry her when he was in love with the mother? Just plain old silly and clearly stretched any resemblence of rational behavior."
4,"Best book of its genre, that I have read in a long time",I loved the twist and turns of individual story lines that blended in the end. I loved the humor contrasting with the soul searching that we all in real life have to endure.
3,Rejected Suiter,I hoped the first time it would get on but then another twist and then another twist. Finally the end which was as if the author got tired or bored and stopped.
2,not my style,"Characterizations were implausible, motivations and process not explained well. Lots of holes in the plot and historical background. Cover was nice...."
3,The Rejected Suitor,"This book was and ok read. You know from the start what the outcome will be so no surprises.Anyone that needs a fast read will like this book,"
5,This book builds a bridge of global connections.,"Having read the first edition of this book with great enthusiasm, I quickly got the second edition. Janeanne Narrin does it again, building bridges connecting many kinds of people, scientists, environmentalists, seekers on the spiritual path, weaving a common thread of thought. Readers are taken directly into the heart of Reiki Energy Medicine, a relaxation technique and transformative experience. Reiki, a down to earth system so simple yet profound. It assists peoples' innate wisdom to aid healing on all levels, a system finding its way into the medical community. If possible, the second edition of One Degree Beyond is even better than the first. It lights a torch revealing paths of exploration through scientific approaches, poetry and storytelling. This book is a gem, a guide for personal and planetary healing."
5,Great Tasting Protein Bar,"I have this bar with a cup of coffee as well. It's a great tasting protein bar, that goes well with any diet..very filling, and bigger then most of the other brand bars out there."
1,There is a much better version of this concert also for sale on amazon,"Every cut on this CD is truncated from the original concert. This album was produced in Germany and apparently has had more than one distributor. TIM the international music company, Acrobat, and Prism Platinum, all containing the same 8 tracks and all sold on Amazon.. There are five or six albums out there with the title. ""Take Five"" probably hoping to capitolize on the best selling single of that name from the ""Time Out"" album. The better version of this music is to be found on the Take 5 Quartet: A Jazz Hour With Dave Brubeck Quartet"" imported from Portugal. This album contains the full length recordings and adds a bonus track from Cannes, France as track 9. It's UPC number is 8712177036998 if you care to search for it, or look under my reviews. I wonder if Dave made a nickel out of any of these imports."
3,Nice Try,"Unfortunately, in this volumn, Gray appears to have ""cranked"" this one out for his publisher. It appears to have been hastily written although there is certainly some very good material in the book. A small, yet more useful book I have found is The Romantic's Guide by Michael Webb. It is full of great dating and relationship ideas and advice. Don't sweat the small stuff in love is also helpful."
2,Not Gray's best (not even that good),"It is obvious that Gray spends more time counseling married couples than singles. His understanding of the differences between the genders seems sound enough, but it is obvious he has not been a part of the dating scene for some time. All of his books require some generalizations to meet the needs of so large an audience, but much of his advice in this particular book is so oversimplified as to not be practical. I have enjoyed (and would recommend) some of his other books, but this one doesn't measure up."
2,"OK to browse through, but don't buy into the stereotypes","This book is definitely written from the point of view of a man, and 75% of the ""do""s and ""don't""s are directed towards women - very disappointing. It has a few good points about general behaviour of men and women, some of which you may not have thought about. My biggest objection with the book is the over-generalization of the behavior of people based on their gender. I'm a dating woman and I don't associate with most of the supposed behaviors described in the book. My guess is that most readers won't either. We are all complex individuals based on genetic and environmental makeup. It is absurd to think that there are only two general categories of behavior models for our population!"
5,"It's my ""handbook""","Mars and Venus on a Date is the first John Gray book I've read. Having been widowed a year and a half and being back in the world of dating, I found that this book was very helpful to find the kind of relationship I'm looking for. There were so many parts of the book that I wanted to refer to, I got out my yellow highlighter, and now view this book as a sort of 'handbook' of dating. I have a better understanding of how men think, and how women think, and the mistakes many women (myself included) seem to make in an effort to find their ""soul mate."" I highly recommend this book to anyone who just don't seem to be getting anywhere in the world of love."
1,very bad image for amazon,"I am very disappointed. I bought this book more than a month ago and have not gotten it yet, I do not even know if I will ever get it. I sent an email to the seller but did not get an answer. The seller was LittleBella..."
5,Our Instincts Can Get Us Into Trouble ....,.....when you're dealing with someone (with different instincts) from a different planet like Mars or Venus.My current boyfriend recommended that I read this book and I only wish I read it sooner. The fact that we're both reading it has helped our romance blossom into the love of our lives. :o)
3,Good once you've got someone,"This book is great to figure out where you are in the five stages, but I kind of wanted to find out ways to start a relationship. I would assume it to be a great help once you have someone though. If you want a book on finding someone I'd suggest How to Make Anyone Fall in Love With You."
3,He's a much better lecturer than a writer.,"Get the Powertalk interview with Tony Robbins if you really want to get the best out of the guy... he knows his stuff, but when he tries to distill it into hints and actions in this book, it seems as though he's telling us to not be ourselves, to seek the things we don't crave, and to act unnaturally. I gave the book to my friend who finds some of it dead-on in practise, and much of it confounding."
1,"OK at first, then offensive","The first 2/3 of the book was OK, with balanced ""points of view"" and ""how-to's"" for both men and women. Some of the information was interesting, explanatory, and useful; some was not.But then the author began giving unbalanced treatment, primarily telling women how they ought to behave and what they ought to say. The message was that a man has a large and fragile ego, and that a woman should support his ego. She should never disagree with him, except ""playfully"". In public, she should paint him as a white knight, regardless of what really happened.Perhaps it was just the author's writing style, but most of his examples, supposedly of real couples he'd observed or counseled, seemed made-up.Finally, at the end of the book, the author insults the reader's intelligence with an idiotic, redundant, and unnecessary list of 101 places to look for a mate. Very patronizing."
4,thought it would be sexist,"I was very skeptical when someone recommended this book. Not only am I leary of self-help books in general, I thought I would be turned off by the concept that men and women automatically act in certain ways just because of their gender. While there are obvious exceptions and variations to general tendencies, I thought this book did an excellent job of pointing out the different way men and women think and act. It did so in a way that wasn't insulting to either men or women. At times, I did think it was simplistic. However, I think the general premise that men like to pursue and women enjoy being pursued is pretty basic."
1,Nothing to review,"I received another title in this series instead of the one I ordered. Therefore, I cannot provide any direct feedback for this title.I did glance at the other book (Starting Over after divorce) and it seemed very high-level and did not provide any deep insight into life after divorce that I had not seen in other sources. It is fine for someone who has not done any reading on the topic, but not worth the time/money for someone who has read other texts."
2,"yeah, we've all heard about mars and venus... get a new LINE","These books are getting old. Same story as the last... same story as the next. A much better book is ""The Game"" which i have also read... get past the nice guy personna as it's REALLY NOT what women are looking for."
5,A woman's must have,Loved it !! every woman must read it has life changing inf clear concise and such priceles content ladies finally a book that lets u into the mind of men u have to read it both men and women can benefit from this book
5,Essential For Dating Success!!!,"Ever want to reach into the head of the opposite sex while dating?? This lets you in on aspects of both men and women in relation to dating and relationships that could change your dating life forever! If you want the upper hand in your relationship, read this. I couldn't put it down!"
3,Fairly Useful...Clearly Targeted for Women,"The best parts of this book are when Gray writes of how counterproductive it is for women to chase and pursue men. Little practical advice for men, not a waste of time but hopefully men will read Justin Sterling and R. Don Steele about dating and relationships."
2,Generalizations with no supporting data,"John Gray certainly sounds convincing as he outlines for us the roles men and women must play in order to successfully navigate the dating game. But the roles he proposes are just too rigid to be realistic. He attempts to convince us that the man must be the pursuer and the woman the pursued, with little supporting evidence to back up his claims, aside from testimonials of people attending his seminars and clinics. This book ranks up there with ""The Rules"" for moving male/female relations back into the dark ages. Believe it or not, Dr. Gray, there are men out there who admire a woman who goes after what she wants, even in relationships."
2,Dr. Gray Makes Dating a Game - Count Me Out,"New to dating after years in a marriage made me uncomfortable so I bought this book. There's a few enlightening segments that make sense but most of the book relegates dating to being a game that is played between man and woman. I would like to think that someone is attracted to who I am from the start. I consider myself an educated woman and frankly, some of what Dr. Gray suggests I say or do to get a positive response from men is downright degrading. I would hope that men are attracted my intelligence and would like the fact that I can solve some problems and give some good advice. I guess I just don't like the fact that Dr. Gray wants men to stay the way they were before the women's movement and wants women to bat their eyelashes and ooh/aah a man to her web. That's what this seemed like to me. Count me out of it. I am doing pretty well in the dating scene without this type of stuff."
4,Useful and Fun Guide to Dating,"Though a bit dated now, I still found this book useful.It's so easy to get into a relationship without knowing how to behave on dates and appreciating how the genders are so different in their behaviour and thinking.Do read this book to get a general idea of these differences but do not base all your relationship and dating on it!At the end of the day, it just comes down to being authentic in your relationship and knowing just what you want from your partner.Arvind DevaliaAuthor of ""Get the Life you Love"""
2,Pretty... bad,"While not completely devoid of value, this book relies heavily on vastly simplified gender stereotypes. This alone is some sketchy stuff, but the writer seems to insist on an incredibly unhealthy sounding relationship dynamic which can be boiled down to ""men are happy when they serve women successfully and women are happy when they are served by men"". If women were actually half as fitlessly narcissistic as this book portrays them to be then it'd be time to go gay, fellas.There are a few pieces of insight to be gleaned from this book, but with many much better books floating around there's no need to spend time on this thing and its trite cliches rehashed in psychobabble smoke and mirrors."
1,promotes stereotypical behavior,"This is a rehash of his first book, with ""tips"" on how to attract a date. However, his system seems to be based on antiquated, stereotypical, gender-biased behaviors that i believe are destructive and deceptive. For example, he recommends being cheery and upbeat at the beginning of a relationship then-whammo!-letting your true self out after the attraction is established. Not good advice, if you ask me! Stay away from this book!"
1,How to Mechanically Go Through Life's Most Natural Process,"I bought the book when I was seeing someone and it doesn't help! It's so mechanical. This thing about you ""just know"" when someone is right for you is the only part of the book that makes any sense because Dr. Gray can't explain it. You can either buy the book and fumble through the dating process or you can just fumble through the dating process till you ""just know"". According to Dr. Gray, there are 5 steps in the dating process. I suggest that there are 1001 ways to live without this book and find the right partner anyway.John, if you read this, please know that I understand you're trying to help people through the dating process and I know you can do a better job than ""Mars & Venus on a Date"". I still find your original Mars & Venus outstanding."
3,What can I say,"Yet another Mars vs. Venus, you've read one, you've read them all!You know, these books are actually very easy to read (and quick). It's not extremely intellectual and you won't want to teach it in a class, but it actually has some good pointers in it and provides some insights. It's not a reference book, but it's fairly organized so you can ""look things up"" on a need basis."
4,Good info,A lot of good insight into the dynamics involved in the dating process between the genders. I recommend the book for those who don't understand why they are having difficulty meeting their mate.
4,Valuable Info.,"John Gray offers some important information that can be overlooked in men/women relationships. In this ""PC"" world we live in it isn't polite to say that men and women are different, but we are. And this book has some interesting insights into our differences. It has helped me to not take it so personal when men say and do (or don't say or do as the case may be) things that can be offensive. This book helps me to forgive and love the men in my life."
5,Interesting,Was purchased for my daughter who is single and wanted dating advice. She reported that the book was very imformative
3,This book is a good guide to *some* but not *all* people,"I bought this book because I was trying to understand arelationship I was in.I am a 20something woman who was dating a 20something man. As I read the book I started realizing he was playing the *FEMALE* role.I think a lot of what Grey has to say is valid - just not for all people. Particularly not for people under 30 who may have been raised in a radically different social climate than their parents were.here's a hint.If you are at all a member of Generation X - THROW AWAY YOUR DATING BOOKS. ""Mars/Venus"", ""The Rules"" don't work on people of our generation.Instead I recommend you pick up a book called ""If the Buddha Dated"" by Charlotte Kasl, which poses the radical idea that we are all from Earth.Better yet why doesn't somebody write a dating book that applies to our age group, and its different gender ideas?"
4,My take on Mars and Venus on a date,"""MARS AND VENUS ON A DATE"" is a great book. It is very educational for anyone that is single and just can't seem to find their sole mate or they discard their sole mate for lack of understanding them.I do think that everyone should read ""MEN ARE FROM MARS AND WOMEN ARE FROM VENUS"" first, so that this book makes complete sense. These are two great books and everyone should read them. These books really help to improve your communication skills with the opposite sex~!"
3,Good content bad writing,"This book has some decent guidelines and observations. I think anyone who reads it will benefit in one way or another. The only problem with this book is that it is writen in very simple english. It has a feel like it's meant for Junior H.S. kids with its simple sentence structures. Another problem with it is that it is highly repetetive, I believe the author could have squeezed the entire book into 1/3 of its size without the loss of generality. The 'real life' examples illustrating the dating rules seem extremely fake. It seems like the author just made up these stories to illustrate his point. I don't know if this is true but his simple writing style make it seem that way."
4,"Very insightful, but...","This book was very insightful in many areas, but it seemed to have a lot of repetition. Also, Dr. Gray failed to give any mention or acknowlegement toward interracial and intercultural relationships. (I am a white male dating an asian female, BTW.)Aside from that, Dr. Gray did an excellent job. For guys, I also strongly recommend ""Women: Maxim's Unauthorized Guide."" I don't think it's available here, but if you mix Dr. Gray with the writers of Maxim Magazine, you really can't go wrong. Best of luck!"
4,Very insightful information about dating.,"Mars and Venus on a Date.... I thought it was all in my head until I read this book. Alot of this book brings to light the different ways that men and women approach dating and each stage of a relationship. I felt very enlightened. It really made me stop & think about my approach to dating, and I think that it helped me revise my view of relationships as a whole. I especially enjoyed the section titled ""Why He Doesn't Call."" If you are single, just entering a relationship, or are in a long-term dating relationship, I highly recommend this book. Great for women *and* men!"
5,a very interesting book,I haven't had a chance to read it yet. I haven't had a chance to read it yet. I've heard alotabout it and look forward to reading it after the holidays. Thanks
4,Love & Marriage,Great book for newly found relationships. It helps men and women understand how to love one another and communicate effectively.
4,A reistic ontology,"The status of the regulations in our rational speculations and hence the definitions of the 1st-order logic was one of the most interesting topics for the logicians working now a days. The author stated that human beings achieve equality by monitoring the quantities and then PERIODICALLY adding or substracting. And furthermore the author extended this observation in the history of China as YIN and YANG and the attention to KARMA in India in addition to that in Anaximander of early Greece. And also in Politeia of Plato, the recommendation of KUKLUS was following this tradition in order to support the theory of IDEA. This can be read as the reistic ontology of those axiomatic approaches, we think."
3,Bit too much talk,"This is A&E special and viewers called in with requests. I bought EWF and Chicago in Concert and LOVE IT. I bought more, gave as gifts and everyone loved it. This is not as good, certainly EWF entertains but seemed A&E curtailed how they normally are."
2,Huge pain the butt,Couldn't be more difficult to install if they made it to be difficult to install. Easy enough to make a hole and put this thing in there but just try hooking up to it. The clip that holds your plug in place is cheap and flimsy.... when you try to push the external plug into the outlet everything just falls apart. I ended up gluing everything in place and now it works fine.. just don't expect this to be frustration free.
2,not a plug or receptacle,Does not have any plug in it only a to be used with chargers. Really just a hole with cap. I was hoping to adapted to different plug has nothing but hole with a cap
2,this part is probobly from my box,marineco gives these with these chargers and mine3 was not in my box- so they proboboly sold it to you.
1,It's poor quality,When we took this in to get it reset the jeweler showed us the huge cracks that had been covered over by a glass product or paste of some kind that melted off when they put it through routine cleaning (I trust the jewelers--they are BBB approved and have been in business for 18 years in the same location). It broke my heart that he spent so much money on something that was not what it was supposed to be. Do not buy this jewelry and be suspicious of this company.
4,Judging a book by its cover,"PAMELA, DID YOU HAVE TO PUT you picture on the cover? If you're trying to galvanize those who are already vegetarians, I'm sure you'll succeed. However, for meat eaters who need convincing, your picture alone is going to put them off of buying the book and subscribing to the idea, for sure.Look at you. You look like a librarian from Akron, and a bitter one at that. Non-vegetarians already associate vegetarianism with reedy pretentious types, so a big sarcastic ""thanks for helping.""In your next publication, a little less narcissism, please.Orwell was right.... the worst advertisement for any cause is its adherents."
2,Try one of the Remaster CD's instead,"I bought the CD on the chance that I would be pleasantly surprised. I was not. Other than what you are already familiar with, there are few other gems here. The CD suffers from the monaural source material. Maybe try one of the Remaster CD's."
5,Lessons from John Renbourn,"Having recently bought a copy of John Renbourn Fingerstyle Guitar, I was pleased to find the book (with accompanying CDs) gives a balanced representation of the different styles of music for which the master is known. Standard notation coupled with tablature and the CDs offers a student of fingerstyle guitar an opportunity to learn these tunes regardless of your level of written musical literacy. However, this is no beginners book and at least an intermediate level of fingerstyle guitar fluency is required. For most of us, it will require work -- but the rewards of learning some of the arrangements of one of the all-time great guitarists is worth it."
3,Eh,"I've seen better. Contains a number of good tunes (nothing by John Renbourn can be that bad, right?) The only problem really, (and it's a big one) is that most of the tunes have been over-simplified from the original recordings. For example, the first two, 'Judy' and 'Angie' are favorite tunes of mine, but have been so over simplified in this book that they are not worth learning.CheersTroll"
3,Died too soon,Bought it in January and it's dead now in March. That's 3 months when their claim is an average life of almost a year. Going to buy once more and give it one more try since its cheap.
5,Love of the Zouk,"I grew up listening to Kassav' and Jocelyn Beroard. So this CD is trip down memory lane for me. From the nice afro-caribbean beats to the zouk love tunes, it does not disappoint."
5,These speakers are awesome!,"I still can't pick my jaw up off the floor after listening to these speakers. I use these speakers in conjunction with my Audigy Gamer sound card and can only admit that it is an unbeatable combination. My sounds are much clearer and have so so much more detail and depth. The subwoofer is awesome, I can feel the ground vibrate as if I were there (in the movie I'm watching at the time). You must get these speakers if you are an audiophile. I got them right here at amazon.com for [amt]and it's well worth every penny."
2,Great System before it Burnt Up.,"The sound and volume from this system is amazing. I loved it!! The problem is it overheated after 45 minutes at 80% volume and the power supply fried.Creative Labs is not offering any warranty coverage for me because I live in the Virgin Islands.The power supply needs to be made external in order to disipate the huge amount of heat created by the power supply.I am still trying to get resolution with them and if I do, I will happily give the system high marks. Like I said, when it worked, it worked well."
1,"Started okay,","The unit shipped with a screwed LR channel. Then a couple days later, it died completely. It was great while it lasted, but now I have to pack it, and return it. While the speakers are relatively cheaper than the Klipsch, it is not worth the hassle...(nor the price)"
1,Another Disappointed Audiophile,"When I received this speaker set yesterday, I quickly hooked it up to my computer and popped in a dvd. The pure 5.1 sound field, the thunderous bass, and the sheer quality of the sound overwhelmed me....for about three hours. Then, like the previous reviewer, the subwoofer amplifier unit simply died. No wheezing, no coughing, no warning....just sudden and complete silence. I triple checked the speakers, the connections, and my sound card. They were all fine.Never again."
3,Ultimately not so happy,"The color is wayyyyyyy off on the shock boots i ordered. This is why i hate ordering things online, but i have really no choice. There are no stores within 100 miles of me that carry these. I wont be installing them...most likely selling them on ebay :("
4,Pretty good game for Godfather enthusiasts,"This is a pretty good game. The storyline is entertaining and the graphics are well done. The voice acting is a nice touch and well above average.If you like the Godfather movies you will get a kick out of playing some missions that come straight out of the movie, and if you arent a Godfather fan you will still probably enjoy the GTA style action."
1,it was a xbox game instead of 360 which is wat i wanted.,I odered the game for the 360 and got it for original xbox and don't kno how to fix it. Cannot even play the game. Need to know about exchanging the game.
5,Definitely worth a listen...,This new young country artist is really outstanding. The album has several great songs but my absolute favourite is 'Just About Prob'ly' If this song receives the airplay it deserves it will positively be a gigantic hit!The singer's voice and presentation can hold it's own with any country artist in the USA.Let's hope this young man gets the recognition his talent merits. If he does he will be a major recording artist for many years to come.
2,Don't make their own...,"I used to use Newman's a lot but they do not produce their own food. So, I do not use it anymore, since the scare with Menu Corporation."
5,Beautiful Deep and Sincere Alto Voice That Captures The LOVE OF CHRIST and CHRISTIANITY !,"I could listen to Lynda Randle, as with my other chosen CDs, over and over. I keep them playing on Itunes day and night to keep Christ alive in my life 24/7. Beautiful, meaningful songs that give one a sense of FAITH and TRUST in GOD, through JESUS CHRIST ! A-MEN !"
5,God On The Mountain,I received the CD very promptly and in great condition. This was my first experience buying a used CD and I am very pleased with the CD and the condition it came in as well as the time it took to get the product!
5,Super is an understatement,"I truly love the music of Lynda Randle and this is my favorite of all. The lead song, God on the Mountain, is the best I've ever heard it. Try the samples and I'm sure that you'll want the CD."
4,God on the Mountain CD,"This album by Lynda Randle is a good addition to anyone's religious music collection. I purchased it for the title song, which is a stirring sermonette in itself. Some of the other material was good but not great. I would like to have seen several old-time gospel classics included, but all in all it is good listening and inspirational."
5,Another glorious CD from Lynda!,I have been listening to Lynda for about two years now and the woman has NOT put out one bad song! Not to mention she is a sweetheart. If you meet her at a concert she treats you like an old friend. Wonderful person with such a glorious God given voice.
5,One of my favorites!,"I have been working with dogs for over 30 years and a service dog trainer for the last nine. I have just started my own private training business and this book was a refreshing read. Having worked with many people and their dogs, I could relate to many of the personalities described in the book. Reading this book was positive reinforcement for me and helped me realize that I have many of the tools to get my business up and running. It gives lots of helpful suggestions on how to work ""with"" people, encouraging them to understand and hopefully agree with you even if your suggestion differs from what they originally thought; making them think it was their idea. Expect the unexpected when working with people and their dogs. Relax and get ready to smile and learn."
3,relatively disappointing,"Bessie Head was a brilliant writer and storyteller, but she does not show it in this novel. Her novel ""When Rain Clouds Gather"" is wonderful, as are many of her short stories. ""Maru"" dims in comparison. This story is told in such a way that we as readers are treated like children, and at the same time is vague and nonspecific much of the time. The characters are rather unrealistic in their romantic pursuits and personal motivations. However, this is a good choice for literature that gives valuable information and insight into the culture of rural Botswana. ""When Rain Clouds Gather"" would be a better option, though."
4,Better than Airplane,"This was one of the funniest films I have seen in a long time. There was a joke about every five seconds. The lead actor was hysterical. The pace was a little quick, and the video transfer did seem poor quality, but overall the film was well worth watching."
4,A Weird Al Yankovic style parody,"Greetings from Tromaville!A parody of cop films involves a cop who tries to solve a murder with his traumatized friend who is a policeman that think's he's a dog (""It's a shame, he was a good cop."" ""Yea, but he's a great dog!""), a woman who has an identical twin step-sister, and many other zany charectors!If you are a fan of ""The Naked Gun"", ""Hot Shots"", or ""UHF"", you should definetly check out ""Blonds Have More Guns"""
4,What A Good Book!,"This book is fabolus, captivating and enriching! Above all it is simply a good story, intreguing but not impossible to put down on you night stand when the time comes to get some shut eye.The children who the book revolved around were an amazing blend of innocence and intelligence that made them seem as if they could have been the kids next door. Their chemistry is enough to make anyone wish for a chance on thir adventures.Narnia, a fantastical world, happens to be the site of the children's exciting escipades. One can end up there by steping into a magicial wardrobe. The evil white witch is the ruler of the land who is eventually overthrown by the children and their friends that they make along the way.There are many exciting plot twists that make C.S. Lewis' book well worth the read! Hope you enjoy it!"
5,love,Power is funny to watch when they are in trouble and they use there stone for help no mater what.
4,Everything you Need in One Box !,I am very pleased with this product.Everything you need to install and start using this product is one box. It only took me 10 minutes to install and I am a novice at computers.I have had much fun !
4,"Excellent quality, ease of use, affordability...",This is an excellent buy for the first time user. I bought this for my parents to use who have very little technological prowess and they love it. The USB connection and simplied instruction booklet make for unintimidating ease of use - an important factor when buying for older family members. The picture quality is great for the price.
3,customer support on intel pc camera,I had to call customer support to get the correct software ID number. They have incorrectly labled the software.
3,camera is ok but you need to down load drivers from the net.,if you have a hewlett packard and buy this camera you need to download master riptide file Rip2141.exe. however it is hard to find on the net becouse there web page has been down for days.
1,Compatibility problems with HP 8580C computers,"Picture quality is very good. But I have had compatibility problems with my new HP 8580C computer (purchased 8-99). When you go into program for the 1st time the computer freezes up after entering the configuration wizard, user info screen. Intel told me to download Rip2141 from Riptide. I did that and got past the config. wizard, but lost the ability to play any midi file. I was the told to download har105 and was able then to play midi files, but could not get past the video size test in the configuration wizard. Intel worked with me and also HP worked with me but each ended up blaming the other and my Intel program still doesn't work. Camera works with MS Net Meeting though."
3,Intel Camera Only Runs With 95/98 No 2000 Drivers,"The Camera Runs GREAT on my Win98se machine. But dont try to run it on a Win2000 Machine, according to Intel Support, there are no supported or beta drivers. Intel's software wont even load on a 2000. Stay away if your running Win2K"
3,Invisible Fence Collar,It seems that Innotek has trouble supporting their products. I have purchased several after the fact replacements collars and chargers. Failure happens often and I do not seem to get Innotek to answer the warranty claims. Local stores do not carry these products and as a result the integrity of the system (in other words keeping the dogs inside the fence) fails if the dogs are continually testing and looking for ways to escape.
3,Worked well until thunderstorm.,"I really liked the invisible fence, and the portable remote that came with my unit. They both worked wonderfully for a couple of months. I took the remote on walks with my dogs, and although I never had to use it, I believe it would have been very helpful if they had decided to take off after a wild animal or another dog. Unfortunately, the invisible fence quit working after a thunderstorm. I looked online, and found that lightening can take them out. I searched for a way to fix the problem, but could not locate the break in the wire or a way to fix it without replacing the whole thing. We get many thunderstorms in this area, so I decided to chain the dogs again."
1,Revolving Door,"The system works good but the collars keep dying. At $100 per collar, I wonder if Innotek had this in mind for a re-occurring revenue stream. Maybe they build in some ""planned obsolescence"" to ensure $100.00 every year from each existing customer? I'm just waiting for another manufacturer to make a better collar that works with this system."
2,Not anywhere near as good as the original,"This collar works, but does not fit or charge on the original charger, you have to get a new charger as well, they have improved the clasp. But the charging is a downer, we also have an electric blanket and when it cycled on, on our bed it shocked the dog so there are definite drawbacks on the electrical interferance problems as well."
3,"OK, but.........","I thought this book was OK, but to me it seemed dead. I thought it was boring in more then one part and kept skipping parts just to get the book done. The story was Ok, but at the same time I thought it was stupid to base the whole book on how a grown woman would do that. It is understandabe to take you family's opinions into account in times like that, but come on. I was not really happpy with this book at all. Not enough in it for me anyway."
3,Just okay....,"I thought Destiny Unleashed was a bit boring and not as adventurous as Sherryl Woods' other novels.Her other books had a sense of mystery and suspense. Destiny Unleashed was too romantic and no adventure.It was a quick read, but I couldn't wait to finish it."
5,It was the love of a lifetime...,"...and worth the twenty year wait.Two decades ago Destiny Carlton and William Harcourt had it all, but tragedy and misunderstanding. Now, William is playing for keeps.Two people meant for each other rediscover love in this sweet story by Sheryl Woods."
2,Queen's logic DVD,"I am not a fan of Joe Mantegna, I bought the movie mostly because I like Linda Fiorentino and John Malkovich a lot...... Fiorentino disappointed me here, and Mantegna who has a thankless role is a total disappointment too.I think Anthony LaPaglia would have better served the role played by Mantegna."
2,Will appeal most to native New Yorkers,"This comedy-drama has some genuinely funny moments, however I believe the drama would appeal most to natives of New York City. Although this attempts to be an ensemble piece such as The Big Chill, I found some of the characters difficult to believe: Kevin Bacon's character (not his performance, which was fine) shouldn't have been able to pick up the woman in the bar, yet he did. Maybe if I were from New York I'd believe it more. If someone wants to watch this for a particular actor, Joe Mantegna seemed to me to be the most central character, although it isn't evident from the description or cast list. In the same spirit, female fans of John Malkovich looking to see him in yet another sex role should be forewarned that his character is gay. I haven't ruined the film for you by saying so, however, since it comes as no surprise in the movie."
2,Not even Tom...,"I originally bout this for Tom Waits, but he's hardly in it.And John Malckovich as 'the gay friend'.Don't bother with this one"
4,Excellent synthesis,"For those who are interested, this is an excellent synthesis of recent theoretical perspectives on lesbianism."
4,Architect of Evil,"This Grand Moff Tarkin figure was part Kenner's 12"" Star Wars Action Collection line. Kenner's figures aren't the works of art that the later Sideshow figures are, but I really enjoyed collecting the `90s 12"" figure line.Pros - The head sculpt is quite impressive, and actually looks like Peter Cushing. Sadly, that was the exception to the rule in this figure line. His outfit is well done and very detailed too. The addition of a Death Star Torture Droid was another nice touch.Cons - He's pretty bulky for a cadaverous old guy. Using the same body type as was used for the Luke Skywalker and Han Solo figures was a mistake with this character.Tarkin played a key role in the original Star Wars film, and it's good to see him in the 12"" figure series. It's not the best figure in the collection, but I'd consider it an essential figure nonetheless.NOTE - Grand Moff Tarkin was previously available in an exclusive 2-pack that also included a 12"" Death Star Gunner."
4,Love Sports Movies,"Always enjoy a good sports movie, especially one showing a young Shaq and Penny Hardaway. Just needed to go back and check it out."
4,Blue Chips,"Nick Nolte, Mary McDonnell, and Shaq all did some great acting in this movie, I was glad I ordered it.thanks!!"
4,Tugs at the Heart Strings,"Like the previous reviewer, I too have a hard time keeping my composure during the riveting panda sequence. I thought the life-affirming montage, cleverly filmed in raw black-and-white, truly inspired the film to rise above being run-of-the-mill sports movie to a commentary on the oxymoron of the fragility and strength behind the human spirit.While Steel and Kazaam didn't allow Shaq to explore the depths of his on-screen personality, Friedkin's direction is able to elicit a performance from the big man parallel to the coaching of Zen Master Phil Jackson.Truly a wonder to behold."
3,One Of The Best Sports Films Of The 90's,"William Friedkin's Blue Chips is an engaging and though compelling look at a dark side of sports these days. Nolte's gives a great performance as a coach forced to go under the table to get his team back to it's winning ways. J.T. Walsh provides support as a rich, gift giving friend of the college Nolte coaches for. I rank this film up there with Hoop Dreams, Without Limits and Rudy as the greatest sports films of the nineties. We can all thank Friedkin for having the sense to put the shot clock at the bottom of the screen during the final scene of the big game instead of having to cut back to it every second. Overall, great basketball action, good direction and a positive message make this a great buy."
4,Nice but....,Adjustable launch leg a problem cause it gets really loose.Other than that a fine product...
5,Rockets,Bought a bag of Estes rockets for my Grandson for his birthday and this was one of the items I put in the bag. Good birthday gift for a boy.
1,Gross!!!!!,Yuck! Sickening stupid movie. No wonder I couldn't find it on DVD. Swimming in poop - some on - while wearing scuba gear. Who wrote that? Geez!!!!!!
3,"Not ""The Searchers,"" but lots of fun","Albeit in a somewhat campy vein. I think I like the dialogue of ""Surviving the Game"" more than any other aspect of the film. I guess I'm a dialogue kind of guy. I love Richard Crenna's speeches in ""First Blood,"" Arnold's in ""Conan""--I walk around quoting them--(how's that for honesty, folks!)--and I quote from this movie often. Rutger Hauer delivers his lines as only he can (""consume it--slowly""), Gary Busey is, well, Gary Busey (""the purity of your primal essence""), and F. Murray Abraham (""four HUNDRED dollars""), Charles Dutton (""you don't want to be slow tomorrow""), John C. McGinley (""don't take my shot"") et al., put in honest performances what am I talking about here.BASICALLY I want to buy this video because every time it's on TV they censor it..."
3,"Not as entertaining as Hard Target, but still good","Though I had so much fun watching Jean-Claude Van Damme and Yancy Butler dodging meniacal hunters' bullets through New Orleans, I thought this movie was almost as good. Teriffic performances and great scenery didn't make this movie as good as Hard Target, but I'm sure you will have almost as good a time."
5,BEST MOVIE EVER,"I used to watch this movie on TNT as a kid growing up. Ive probably seen it over 5 times but none of my friends remember it. Ive been searching for a long time trying to find the title and i finally found it!!!!This is one of the best movies ive ever seen. Definitly one of my top 5. What could be better than ICE-T being hunted in the forest. Everything about the movie rocked, except the cheasy basement scene, with the jars... yeah... I guess thats pretty good quality for 1994 though.WATCH THIS MOVIE"
5,Ice-T's Best Performance!,"For those of you that don't know, Ice T is a really good actor.This movie is a classic.Highly recommended to all manly men! If you like this movie, check out the movie ""The Hunted""!"
3,ANOTHER RIP-OFF OF THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME,"A HOMELESS MAN [ICE-T] TAKES A HUNTING JOB ONLY TO DISCOVER THAT HE'S THE PREY. YET ANOTHER ''MOST DANGEROUS GAME'' RIP-OFF, BUT, THIS ONE IS BETTER THAN MOST. HAS SOME GOOD ACTION SCENES. I GUESS IT'S WORTH A WATCH. AT LEAST IT DOES HAVE SOME GOOD ACTORS IN IT."
2,Surviving this Movie,"With a cast like Rutger Hauer and Gary Busey, how could you go wrong?!? I tell you where! Ice-T! But, I can't totally blame him because there was also the horrible script, the cheesy acting on everyone's part, and just plain stupid scenes where I couldn't help but laugh. This is a movie you watch late at night when you can't fall asleep (because this will make you got to bed) or a movie that you show your friends because of how corny it is. Overall I rate this movie a -2 out of 5."
4,Above-average action-thriller,"This movie may not win any awards, but if you want to see a decent action-thriller movie, this is one to consider. I liked the twist it had and there was some good acting by Rutger Hauer, Gary Busey, and John McGinley. Depending on your personality, it can be an edge-of-your-seat thriller, or predictable ""bad guys vs. singular good guy"". But, overall, I liked it. (What does that say of my personality?)"
3,Just a Fun Flick,"I wouldn't call this a great work of art, but I've watched it about 10 times and pop it in every month or so. It's silly and the only viewers who will take it seriously are probably younger than 15, but it's still fun. Gary Busey delivers a monologue early in the movie that is really amazing. It'll either be painful or funny watching these actors (F. Murray Abraham especially) deliver their lines - they're that bad. Example: Ice-T character is being pursued by the others, they spot him and one says ""It's Mason! Let's get him!"". Example 2: Bad guys fall for a trap Mason sets - ""Oh no, he set us up!"". But like I said, it is a fun movie. Just don't expect a masterpiece."
3,Hunting Humans!,"It's hard to put this film into any catogory, its got action, drama, comedy and, even a hint of horror. Ice-T is lured to a remote cabin by several wack jobs that have a sick hobby.. hunting humans! Ice-T is mislead by Charles S. Dutton into believing that a job awaits him.. soon after arriving to the cabin in which they had to be flown by privite planes to, he finds that they arent interested in hunting animals. He is in fact the intended prey of these mad men! Good performances (except by William McNamara, the son) by an all star male cast ""Surviving the Game"" is better that I expected. A real twisted and some what disturbing film. This is one to watch with your buddies instead of your girlfriend/wife. Also starring: Rutger Hauer, Gary Busey and, F. Murray Abraham as some of the hunters. 3 1/2 stars!!"
4,Good Plot,Great plot. Ice Tee showed off his acting chops. Makes you view homeless people in a different light. One of the few movies where the star of the movie is black (with a mostly white cast) and not a bad guy (i.e. Training Day) This may explain why it didn't last in movies but trust me it is REAL good
5,Ice T,"Brought the movie a while back, and loaned it out, couldn't remember to who, so I got on the internet and ordered the movie Surviving The Game, from amazon, love the movie. We lived in Wenatchee where it was being filmed, and we drove down the main street in Wenatchee and we seen Tracy Marrow ( Ice T ) walking downtown. That is why we brought the movie. Love that movie- Surviving The Game. Thank you for the very good service, very happy with your service.Will be doing more business with amazon in the near future.Thank you. Margie Loomis"
4,Seen the tv show? You should definitely check out the books!,"I'm a big Murder She Wrote fangirl. I loved watching the series on tv as a teen and I was thrilled to discover that there is a series of novels set around the characters.Gin and Daggers is the first novel of the series. Jessica is abroad in London for a conference and to visit friend and fellow mystery writer, Marjorie Ainsworth. Her plans to sightsee get derailed when Marjorie turns up dead and Jessica is the prime suspect!I really enjoyed this novel. The mystery was great and kept me guessing till the end. Jessica is a likable sleuth and there were plenty literary references to keep my bookish senses amused. I will definitely be reading more books in this series."
3,who edits Kindle books?,"This is the 9th Murder She Wrote book that I have read and all have been of the Kindle format. This is the second book where the word ""corner"" has been spelled numerous times as ""comer."" I usually notice a few mistakes in Kindle books but this is strange to say the least. Jessica referring to Mort as Morton also seemed odd, but luckily my brain was capable of leaving off the ""on"" and Mort was , just Mort."
5,Great game!,We recently purchased this game for my 4 year old son after a visit to the Smithsonian to see the dinosaur exhibit. He absolutely LOVES this game! We've been playing it almost every night since he got it (about 2 months now). It's a fun game. My husband and I even enjoy playing it.
4,Enjoyable!,"My 4-year old isn't the best at sitting still for board games but he really gets into this one! He's dinosaur obsessed right now so he loves that he gets to play as a dinosaur and he does well remembering their different attributes. There are natural disasters, dinosaur attacks and challenges that seem to hold his interest.We've played it several times since getting it for Christmas & I can see that it will be a favorite for awhile."
5,Dinosaur game,"My family use this game on the weekends instead of watching TV, great fun for a family get together"
1,Boring,"My son's are 9 and 12 yrs old. This game couldn't hold their attention, nor mine. It's incredibly boring, slow and unimaginitive. Small pieces got lost and mangled. When we moved, I threw this game in the trash! Please don't buy this item. There are so many other choices for family fun time."
5,5-12 my eye,"I am an 18 year old college student. My girlfriend and I went to a coffee shop after a movie that had this game. We really liked it and played it until the place closed. We had lots of fun, she got it for me for christmas. I may be over the age limit but I DONT CARE! It is a fantastic game... I like it ok."
5,just what i wanted,"Excellent quality, just what I wanted, no problems, nothing else to write about this product at this time. Good product"
2,What about the screen?,"I have an iPod photo: consequently, one of the functions one sometimes wishes to use is the screen in order to display such. I bought this product for the screen protector, as many other ones only protected the iPod's shell.The lousy, loose, cheap piece of plastic has actually managed to GRIND dirt against the screen (because it's designed to move around) to leave some v. nasty scratches.That said, iPod is extremely well protected, but that's not what's important to me. I will now have to spend $20 buying scratch-polishing fluid to fix the damage this product caused."
4,Pretty figurine for the money,"I'm sure that our granddaughter, who is 9 and loves everything to do with princesses, will love this princess to add to her collection. It is some smaller than expected, but is really a beautifully done piece for the cost."
5,Glorious Green,"I was sent this as a gift ready for St Patrick's Day, and to be honest wasn't sure that there was much to know about 17th March. But wait, this book rocks. It's great, full of anicdotes, reads really well, and kept me full of stories for my Irish friends for days. If you do nothing else this St Patrick's Day, grab a Guinness, put your feet up and read this book. Once you've read this you'll realise that, sure, it's a darlin day to be Irish!"
5,"I Loved it so much, I purchased 6 copies for Christmas gifts","These heart warming tales made me feel as though I was apart of the actual stories. I strongly recommend this video to motivate a childs imagination, in saying that, I not assuming that all children have a problem in this area. But, it's a positive transition from negative cartoons as seen on most TV channels today. Yet, I believe this video to be a reinforcement of positiveness in a childs day to day life. Although, maybe isn't noted, but this video is something that should be presented on the Nickelodian or Disney channels."
5,A Very Good Show of Technique and Skill,"I know a lot of people consider the UFC all about blood and violence. Well, this event proves that to win you need technique. This show had some great fighters, including Dan Severn, David ""Tank"" Abbott, Oleg Taktarov, Marco Ruas, Dave Beneteau, Paul Varelans, and Keith Hackney, all proven warriors in The Octagon( Steve Jennum is not a proven warrior). This event is really the UFC at its finest. It really makes you miss the old days of UFC. Now, if you want to see all out brawls, I suggeast UFC 1, UFC 2, OR UFC 6. Any UFC fan owes it to themselves to own this piece of UFC history."
3,OK,"This UFC shows you how crucial a slip can be in a NHB fights. Most the fights are fairly boring, and there is speculation that Frye paid Hall to take a dive so that he would be fresh for the finals. If you're a UFC fan, I recommend getting it, otherwise get UFC's 2 or 6."
2,UU95 IS ALL HYPE,"I got this video thinking it was going to be one hell of a good time.Just look at the fighters on the card,Paul Varelans,Marco Ruas,Oleg Taktarov,Dan Severn,Tank Abbott,Keith Hackney,SteveJennum,and Dave Beneteau.After watching the tape,I was extremelydissapointed.Most of the fights were deadlocked and nothinghappens.The only reason this tape kept from getting one star wasthe fight between Oleg Taktarov and Dan Severn in the final round was pretty good and was pretty bloody(Severn won becauseTaktarov was bleeding pretty good from a cut he got in an earlier fight against Marco Ruas).If you want to see an awesome UFC tape,get UFC VI:Clash of the Titans."
2,Why did I ever bother,"Salman Rushdie is a spent force. He makes the mistake of confusing linguistic gymnastics for literature. The characters in the plot are uniformly shallow and devoid of any interest. After reading the novel, one is left with a feeling of indifference."
2,Sentences that go on and on and on and on....,"This is the first book I've read by the author and whereas I agree that he's definitely got something here, it is my humble opinion, which may not count for too much but is very important to me, that he is rather more in love with words than content and it is also my opinion that he could have ...well...you get the idea...."
3,The one you remember is AurorA. All the others are the same,"It is pity that Rushdie load on this novel so much political idias, historical facts,social eavents. I like very much the way Rushdie discribe the gigantic women Aurora.Why Abraham must be so cruel?"
5,A MUST READ,"I picked up Rushdie's the Moor's Last Sigh, before I headed to India this last winter. I thought it would be a perfect introduction to Kerala...and the city of Cochin. When I was reading the tale, I already felt immersed in the tropical, sultry atmosphere of Cochin. Rushdie's writing style is brilliant; he has a style entirely unto himself. The novel is absolutely sweeping in breadth, he just lifts you into another world. I did not want to put the book down, but I had to once in a while to absorb the intense imagery and mind-blowing language. He has Cochin down to the T. While I was walking around that small fishing town, I suddenly recognzied all the familiar locales he wrote of...from the chinese fish nets, St. Francis Church, the Synagogue..the lake front... It's a fantastic & captivating escape from the grind of our daily routines. Rushdie is a an artiste with words."
3,A brilliant but not exactly enjoyable read,"Rushdie is clearly brilliant, and The Moor's Last Sigh is the work of a genius. I freely admit to having missed a substantial portion of the book; it simply went over my head. I enjoyed the talent of the writer and the thousands of clever connections and tricks of the book. Nevertheless, I found myself absolutely unable to develop true fondness for any of the characters; I really cared very little what happened to them. Most of the time, this included the protagonist, though occasionally I did feel sympathy or slight affection for him. Finally, I found the plot a bit weak. There were one to many twists thrown in until I found myself asking what, exactly, is the point of this whole book?"
1,"Crap that is too clever, by far.","Perhaps the critics enjoy this clever wordplay but I think the majority of us prefer a well-told story. This is not a well-told story and I, for one, would not waste a fatwa on this pretentious author."
3,Great prose style carries the book through.,"After reading, Midnight's Children and Shame in succession, I was ready for a let down. I got precisely that as in comparision, this book lacks the intricate plot of Shame or funny historical references of Midnight's Children. The only thing left is great narrative style of Rushdie, which is in tact and in full bloom. So read it if you are a Rushdie fan. Otherwise, read the other two books as they are gems of English Literature."
3,Read,"I heartily agree with the previous reviewer who wrote that this book reminded him of ""The Tin Drum."" The back cover summary should read: Oskar goes to India and ages twice as fast instead of refusing to grow. Originality, however, is a difficult thing (I'm not even sure how original Gunter Grass was in writing The Tin Drum); but, I have to say that ""The Moor's Last Sigh"" was worth reading but read ""The Tin Drum"" first."
4,Simply fantastic,"This book takes the reader on a wild and imaginative--yet all too real--ride through the crimiality and banality of corruption in the upper escelons of Indian life. A real gem. Rushdie's best work since Midnight's Children and a book you simply won't be able to put down. It especially helps if you've been to Bombay, but his descriptions are good enough so it's really not all that necessary. A wild ride and an intelligent piece of literature that will be admired for generations to come."
5,Delicious!,"This book is like a trip to exotic places, like dining on ambrosia. Rushdie gives us characters which come to life and take the reader along for their fabulous ride. I sighed when it ended and opened it again to the first page and began reading anew. Full of humor, angst, passion and longing for life. This book will remain in the classics section of my library."
2,The Book Dies When The Hero Is Born,"I loved the opening chapters. I was held spellbound by the glorious language, the joyous avalanche of words and colors and smells and tastes and sensations. Then the hero is born, and it turns into a knockoff of The Tin Drum. What a disappointment."
4,work of art,"brilliant...blend of fiction and fantasy, a work of art. the uncanny ability to make you suspend your left brain logic is pure genius."
4,comfortable,I love these shorts. They are mesh and breathe well in warm weather. They are plenty long in length and I am 5 foot 9. I recommend them.
3,duplicate,I think this is the second disk in the season one box. This is being recommended for me because I bought that but that may be a glitch in the system.
4,Sublime Slapstick From Laurel and Hardy,"""Block-Heads"" (1938) finds Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy at the peak of their comic art. Running a brisk 57 minutes, there is little plot - only the simple pleasure of being in The Boys' company as they deliver one classic routine after another. If producer Hal Roach had utilized Laurel's original ""black"" ending (with Stan and Ollie's heads mounted on the wall of game hunter Billy Gilbert), the overall feature would rank alongside ""Sons of the Desert"" and ""Way Out West."" Instead, ""Block-Heads"" clumsily reprises the final gag from ""We Faw Down"" (1928). Despite this unfortunate lapse, the film remains among Laurel and Hardy's best. Composer Marvin Hatley earned an Oscar nomination for his delightful score."
3,A mix of mellow hits and more obscure 80s tunes,"My husband and I own this CD as part of our huge collection of 80s music. This album is less representative of popular 80s songs than some of the other collections, as it contains several relatively obscure titles such as ""Girl in Trouble (Is a Temporary Thing)"" by Romeo Void. However, the CD also offers some 80s favorites that you aren't likely to find elsewhere, including ""Eye in the Sky"" by the Alan Parsons Project and Cutting Crew's ""I've Been in Love Before."" Depending on what you are looking for, this might be a nice addition to an 80s collection, but be sure to check out some of the other available compilations, many of which surpass this one."
5,Great Grill Pan for the Price!,"This grill pan heats evenly, doesn't warp, and produces lovely grill marks. Even though it does not have a flat bottom, it works very well on a ceramic cooktop."
5,KitchenAid Grill Pan,I'd buy this again and will recommend this product. No need for oil forcooking which helps with weight control. Sturdy pan.
4,great product,i have owned one of these deep grill pans for about five years. just like cooking on a grill. i love it. so i bought one for my sister for christmas. she didn't believe me on how much the meat tastes like it was grilled. she's a believer now and so is her husband. great price and product. they last for ever if you take care of them.
1,What are you kidding?,"I honestly can't see how this pan got 20/5 stars and 6/4 stars. I think this pan is horrible. I was all excited when I opened it, and then I cooked chicken breasts on it, sorry people I did not see any grill markings. I even pressed down as hard as I could with a cast iron lid on it and no dice. I also did not taste any grill flavors at all.My stove is electric but that should not matter, it still gets hot. I am very disappointed in this pan, no wonder it's on sale for such a great price,however the price that you pay for it is still to much money. It did clean up good though, but so does every other non-stick pan. I will sell it at my flea market for a dollar, and that's still asking to much. Do you get paid to write good comments?"
3,Not for Electric Smooth Glass Cooktops,"I have been getting into watching The Food Network and many of the hosts use these grill pans for cooking everything from salmon to steaks. This pan seemed reasonably priced and of good quality so I ordered it. After washing it and preparing to use it to cook dinner, I then happened to read the fine print on the inside of the cardboard labeling. Do Not Use on Glass Smoothtop Electric Ranges as pan MAY FUZE TO COOKTOP. Not a good thing, so I returned it. Looked like it would work nicely for all other types of cooktops though."
1,You asked for a review so I'll give one,"The necklace lasted a week and then the rubber broke near the clasp. I guess in life you get what you pay for, not what is advertised."
1,Misleading track list,Apparently this is not the enhanced CD version of the single that comes with the tracks (I only bought this for the live studio cuts of Float On and Ocean Breathes Salty) but instead is the regular CD with only the studio version of Ocean Breathes Salty. Huge disappointment.
4,Best Car Seat on the Market!,I spent a great deal of time trying to find the perfect car seat for my ten pound shih tzu. THIS IS IT! She loved it from the moment I put her in it. It is a great size for her to look out the window and later curl up in for a nap. The dynamics and quality of design are exceptional. No straps for her to have to look through or get caught in...and the ability to vary the height is very helpful. I must admit when she is not with me the seat makes a great place to put papers and my purse! Your dog will love you for getting this item!
4,Ruben loves it!,"I recently purchased this booster car seat for my ten pound maltese/shih tzu pup and he absolutely LOVES it! He can see watch the world go by or he can snuggle up and go to sleep. He seems very comfortable in his new car seat. The only problem I have is when I take the seat out to make room for more human riders, the tubes which support the seat come apart. Then I have to insert them into each other once again before I can attach the seat and snap it into place once again. This is a bit frustrating. But aside from all this, my pup loves his new seat...and I l do too!"
4,"LUV, LUV, LUV","I just LUV this car seat! I have a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel named Sadie who now weighs 17 pounds. I bought this delux car seat when she was just a little puppy and she still fits in it. However she's a little squished when she tries to lie down now that she is full grown, but there's still plenty of room when she sits up and is just cruising. So I bought the larger one and keep it in the back seat for her when my boyfriend and I are in the front seat, but when he's not with us I whip this one out of the trunk. It's so easy to just put over the head rest, and she jumps in the car and uses the console arm rest as a stepping stool to get into it. She really loves to go cruising and look out the window. We live in Hawaii and I especially like the fact that the shipping was free! I loved this so much I bought a spare one when the price dropped just in case this one broke or went out of stock. Since she will live a long time I want this car seat to be around as long as she will."
1,Booster Car Seat for Pets,This product came with the fabric sewn in backwards and the steel rods were not able then to go through the slots designed for it. It is a completely inferior and mismade product. I do not recommend this product to anyone.
1,Awful Product - Waste of Money,Solvit Deluxe Pet Booster SeatThis is a terrible product. Would not rest flush against rear bench-type seat and the front collapsed when my 6 pound dog rested his front paws on it. It is also very small. I bought this because it was cheaper than the Snoozer which I've used with my other dog for several years. I guess you get what you pay for (or less). Save your money and steer clear of this pet car seat.
1,not what I order,"I specifically wanted Solvit Car Seat item # 62291. The product was advertised as this item # on Amazon.com. The product received was a different item #. When I told the seller, Little House of Terrors, that this was incorrect, she told me that the item I requested has been discontinued and replaced with the new item. If this is the case, it should not be advertised as item #62291 because it is not that item. This is false advertising. This seller made it difficult for me to return the item, and threatened me when I told her that I was stopping payment of my credit card payment. As a result of this experience I doubt that I will purchase from Amazon.com again. I certainly would not recommend Little House of Terrors nor Amazon.com It was an unpleasant experience. Amazingly when I called the manufacturer direct, I was able to get the correct item."
4,Safe for pup,"I had purchased the smaller size first- my dog jumped out of it and barely fit in it. He's a 14 pound shorkie. I bought the deluxe size and he can lay down in it. I wish the sizing on the box shows measurements in addition to weight sizes. Sometimes I don't strap him in, but I would have liked the straps to be more adjustable. A good product. Came in a timely manner and smaller size was easy to return. Would recommend this product."
4,"Dogs love it, I love it.","My dogs love to ride in the booster seat. They are comfortable and roomy. I bought one booster at first to see if they would like it, now I have two.I would have rated the booster with five stars if the adjustable strap that secures behind the headrest did not slip and loosen. I am going to sew the adjustable strap together to stop the slipping."
4,Greatest thing since squeak toys,"Easy to install and my dogs LOVES being able to see out. Also a crowd pleaser -- all sorts of dog lovers admire it/want one of their own. The only thing I don't like is that every time you move it, you have to rehook the supporting rods (which can be tricky, but not too bad), and I think the clip for the dog (acts as a ""seat belt"" is rather flimsy. It would be safer if a harness were included; we put the seat in the back so she (the Princess) is safer. But -- well worth [...]! We are very glad we purchased this item (and we got it quickly in the mail, too)."
1,HORRIBLE,My dog almost strangled herself trying to turn around in this. I had to pull over to the side of the road to take her out. I would not recommend this to anyone.
1,False advertising,"THIS IS FALSE ADVERTISING. The picture showing the dog car seat shows a seat with a hard back and supports coming up from the bottom of the hard back going up to the front of the seat. That is not what I received. I found out from Solvit that the seat shown is no longer made. The seat I received is just like the one I purchased at a pet store and returned because it does not work in the back seat because you can not get the bottom strap around the back of the back seat. It might work in the front seat but my wife is not going to ride in the back seat so the dog can ride in the front seat. On Amazon. com it said the seat was coming from Little Shop of Horrors, but the FedEx tag has the address for Solvit on it. I can not find out how to return it. I can not find an address for Little Shop of horrors."
1,Received substitute/wrong product,"I was very disappointed because I did NOT receive the product I ordered. The advertisementSolvit 62291 Deluxe Pet Booster Seat said they were available on the website but got a substitute instead. The manufacturer told me they did not produce the product I ordered so they took it upon themselves to send me a substitute. They still have the picture of the Solvit 62291 Deluxe Pet Booster Seat on the website and this is false advertising. I had to return the wrong product for a refund and this was an inconvenience to me. In addition, I feel I got a product that was $20 cheaper, according to what I saw on their website's ad. I was not a happy customer."
1,There has to be something wrong here . . .,30 dollars for a chair and 159.00 for shipping ????203 pounds ????I think the ad should be re written.The thing that is odd is that there are others out there in pretty much the same situation.
4,Not bad but the Hillel web site has modst of the information,"This book gives a fairly good profile of the Jewish population and Jewish activities on a number of college campus throughut the country (and indeed the world). It also profiles Jewish studies courses on each campus and opportunities for kosher meals and religious observance. However, the book is not updated annually. Furthermore, the information in the book is available on the Hillel web site."
4,Very Interesting & Controversial Book,"This book is a very good book about how to gather a burden for the nations as a whole. It is very controversial, though. John Sandford states that polygamy is acceptable in some countries and churches, and that God(Jesus) can be found in all world religions. Although there are many things I find disagreeable, the book as a whole is a must for anyone with a burden for the nations. It has it's redeeming qualities, in which it speaks of mistakes missionaries have been making for years when trying to reach the lost of the world and how to correct them. It really deepend my understanding of how God views the nations of the world. Overall it's a MUST-READ!"
4,not too bad,"This video collection showcases Hal Ketchum's stunning tenor in a reasonably good way. ""Stay Forever,"" ""Past the Point of Rescue,"" and ""Small Town Saturday Night"" are some of the better songs featured. If you are a fan of Mr. Ketchum, you might like this. It goes well with his Hits Collection CD."
2,Very Predictable,Predictable and full of irritating characters (she kills off the one interesting one in the beginning of the book) Don't Bother
4,Great detective pair!,"A wonderful easy read! Lots of different plot twists and the introduction of the detective team, Inspector John Sanders and photographer Harriet Jeffries. They are first accidently involved in the international events relating to a trade conference in Canada, and are drawn into the action as it happens around them. The plot is well balanced with character development of these two, and I very much liked the contrast of Sanders analytical and careful thinking with Harriet's spunk and sense of justice. A wonderful pair, I can't wait to enjoy more adventures with these two!"
2,"Choppy, Hard to Read","The book does not flow well. The author jumps not only between present and past events, but jumps everywhere and all over the place. It was very hard to follow. It wasn't a quick read, because I had to keep reread portions to clarify and catch up. Not a book that can be put down, then pick up and continue reading. But a book that I didn't want to ""keep reading"". I've never read Annie Garrett before, and I think if will be some time before I do again."
1,I hated it!,"This book was so boring that I suffered from headaches every time I read more than 2 pages. Annie Garrett repeated herself in this book way too much. Plus she would have memories of something, and then remember something within those memories, and then go back to what she was talking about in the 2 pages previous. This book is for people that highly enjoy books, because if you don't, you'll be totally confused and end up hating the book!"
5,Absolutely gripping movie.,"True Story, Excellant acting, Nothing objectionable in the Movie. Good story about a woman's struggle with Communist Government in China over Her faith and pursuit of freedom. A must see movie/video for Christians."
4,TOURING TROUBADOURS,"I like samplers. This 1999 Rounder Records collection has value to me because this is where I found the Kennedys. They have become true favorites. Also Cheryl Wheeler, the Nields, and Lynn Miles--two songs each. This sampler has generated the purchase of at least eight cds and from that more than a few songs added to my performing/practicing repertoire. I still refer to this disc now and then. It's an interesting mix of late nineties song craft. Even if I listened 24/365 to all the stuff that is supposed to be worth listening to, I wouldn't be able to get to most of it, so well-selected items like this are a worthy way of accessing and experiencing more music--which is what I want. Touring Troubadours was a good idea."
3,They are a regular pair of flip flops,"I bought these because everyone raves about how great they are. In all reality, they are a regular flip flop. There is no amazing support or fantastic style. They are a basic flip flop that doesn't have rock hard soles. THAT I do like but they are just not the killer flip flop everyone says they are."
2,size is off,I bought a silver pair last year size 7-8 (37-38) and I love them! So much so that I just purchased the gold pair..same size... supposedly. The stamp shows 36-38 but they are clearly larger both in width and length. Like another reviewer stated.. a good half inch past my heel kinda looks dumb. Not sure what I am gonna do.
3,BEWARE of sizing!,"I ordered these in a 9 and got a 7-8! too tight and cuts off circulation. Unfortunately there really is NO 9, it moves to a 9-10 which have NO colors available ... probably because the 7-8 cuts off circulation. Big disappointment since I ordered two pair and can't ""exchange"" them because there are none the next size up available. They're cute ... but uncomfortable."
2,Gold havianas,"I had a pair of havianas that broke last summer.. I loved that pair... I ordered a gold size 37/38, same as my previous pair...Color is great.. But the fit is real wide, unlike my other havianas"
3,comfy,I like Havana's.. I have owned several pair and I think they're relatively comfortable. The only issue is that I have had the strap pull out of the sole a few times and have only had them for a month. It is pretty easy to put back in but it is kind of annoying.
1,Flip flops nice but...,I ordered two different pair from Amazon LLC and both pair were shipped a size smaller than I selected. If they did not have them they need to remove their availability from the drop menu.
2,"Havaianas Women's Metallic Flip Flop,Sand Grey/Light Golden","The only good thing about these is the color. Hard and not comfortable at all, I just don't get all the positive reviews."
5,Comfortable,"Bought it because of it reputation, and it sure lived up to it .But the size 7-8 is a little smaller than usual, when compare to my regular size 7 shoes, it is a little bit smaller!Though it is very comfortable, my wife loves it."
1,sent child shoe size 13 instead of women's size 5,I place an order for a women's size 5-6 and was sent a different style shoe in a children's size 13. I have been ordering from amazon for a long time and this is the first time this has happened to me. It make me not want to order from amazon anymore.
2,metallic brown flip flop,"hi i ordered 3 pairs of flip flop from you's and the slim aqua color and the red ones are really nice. i love them but the metallic ones fit but they are like irregular products, one look nice the other doesn't. how can i send these back to you's. i like the color alot but the flip flops dont look the same. please contact me. thank you for the other 2"
3,"Comfortable, but cheaply made.","I've owned two pairs of these, entirely for in-dorm use and wearing in the shower, and both of them broke within six months of purchase. I liked the comfort of the first pair, which is why I bought the second pair when the strap snapped off the ""stopper"" on the bottom of the right shoe. Unfortunately, the second pair barely lasted a semester before the same strap-snapping issue occurred again. (I did try to use superglue to repair them, but none of the brands of glue I tried, even ones that would theoretically work on plastic, held.)I liked these, but next time I'll definitely be choosing a sturdier brand."
5,Best brand of flip flops,"I would recommend Havaianas to anyone! They are great quality, light, comfortable, and best of all do not cause blisters no matter how far you walk in them. Many descriptions indicate ""slim,"" but I can assure you that wide feet fit them just fine. One word of caution on sizing: I wear a size 10 but get the next size up, 11-12, so my heel doesn't hang off the back of the 9-10. As an Asian who wears flip flops all the time, this brand is my favorite and has been for many years."
2,I found them uncomfortable,"I have so many friends who LOVE their Havaianas! I couldn't wait to get them especially at that great price! My experience was not the same though. I found them uncomfortable to walk in. The part at the side of the foot hit me in the wrong spot and was painful. I don't think it is because I bought a pair that was a size too big either as I tried them on in the correct size in a shop and had the same problem. I love the color as it goes with everything and the bottom cushioning was great too, it's just too bad I couldn't walk in them. My experience with Amazon returns was once again a pleasure and hassle free which is why I keep coming back again and again, they make it very easy to shop!"
5,Resilient,"I haven't had them long, but these flip flops are awesome! A little heel, sturdy rubber sole, shiny straps, what's not to like?"
5,Havaianas Quality,"I am loyal to this brand, they outlast most others. Best of all, the cushion on bottom doesn't get flattened, or shaped to feet. This makes them durable and lasting longer with comfort."
2,"Fine, but not what I expected.","These flip flops are okay, but they don't seem to be any different than a cheap pair from Old Navy or Target. I had a pair of Havaianas that were suuuuper comfortable and soft, but they met their unfortunate end at the teeth of a dog. I bought these to replace them, but they're definitely not the same shoes. I'm not sure if there are different types of Havaianas and I ordered the wrong ones or if these are just cheaply made, but they're not nearly as comfortable. The price is right though if you are looking for a standard pair of flip flops and the gold color is great."
4,They look great!,"I'm a size 39 (European) so I thought that meant I was a size 9 (American). I ordered these in Metallic Hot Pink. They looked great and felt great but sadly, they were too big on me. So I gave them away to my aunt, who claims that they are comfy as well as cute.I think I might be a size 7 or an 8. Next time I'm ordering from Amazon, I'm going to make sure to get these in my size."
3,Comfortable but smelly & dirty over time,"The footbed is comfortable but the foam does absorb smells and dirt over time. The top has a coating so it resists dirt (but not smells), and but the side of the foam is not coated, and absorbs dirt over time. Looks sort of gross on a light colored sandal. I do not think these are as bacteria and dirt resistant as they should be."
4,If the shoe fit,The shoes were too small and the size I needed wasn't available. Otherwise it was a nice looking shoe
5,"Diamond Heart Book 1, The Elements of the Real in Man","This book is a wonderful introduction to The Diamond Approach developed by A.H.Almaas, the methodology of the Ridhwan School of which he is the founder"
2,All woo no substance,"I hate to say it, but the first two diamond heart books are not worth reading. It's all a bunch of touchy-feely woo-woo and nothing valuable or of any substance. Nor did they help me understand the diamond mind/body series any better. Diamond Heart books 3 and 4, on the other hand, were pure awesomeness and definitely DID help to understand everything else. Just my 0.02."
2,Unclear essence,"This book is an uneven and overly-mental approach to the merging of Sufism and psychology. Read chapter one, then skip to chapter nine. The author carries an air of over-confidence in his knowledge of the material. The emphasis on 'holes' and the denegration of the personality make the 'work' hard to accept. Much of the real value of Sufism and its emphasis on essence is diluted in the dialogues and monologue presented here. Better checking with other authors such as K. Helminski for the undiluted approach to this topic."
4,Really good!,"This was a great toy, I bought it for my 6 month old son. I was worried that he would not be able to sit up in it, I'd had this problem with another ring when my daughter was a baby. However this float is great as it has two supportive rings. My son loved it! He could lean forward in the water or relax and sit back. He could also splash as the 'netting' layer lets in small amounts of water. Great product!"
2,"Great color, very small size","This is a very bright fuchsia color. The size is more for a mini-pony, it wouldn't even fit under my daughter's size 12 western saddle. Quality material and product, just too small."
3,Runs Exact Size,This is a nice shoe but the size runs exact. There is no room for toe wiggle at all. I recommend buying a 1/2 size larger for maximum comfort. I returned this color but bought different colors in a larger size.
1,Lowering the bar for all camcorder home movies...,"... before camcorders, the cost of film stock and processing necessitated that filmmakers raise money (or at least have some of their own funds), which imposed a modicum of accountability as to what sort of ""films"" got produced. Ostensibly, if you couldn't convince an investor or family member that your movie should be made, it generally didn't. Unfortunately, with camcorders available now for just a few hundred bucks, all sorts of amatuers are trying to make ""films"" out of this home video medium. Giving a rhesus monkey a scalpel does not qualify the simian to conduct brain surgery. So why is it that every bozo with a camcorder suddenly think's they're qualified to create a filmed drama?"
1,Defective,The prongs are not long enough to enable the adapter to stay in the plug socket. I would like to choose zero stars but can't.
3,anger management,just like grand theft auto this game is a good way for me to get ridof daily stress.i dont really run missions that often.i just go on rampages and start taking cars and running people over.
3,Nothing new,"Different companys make different versions of sport games right? EA, 989 studios, etc. The thing they all have in common is the fact that they are making a game about hockey, or what ever sport. The Godfather has done this. If you've played Grand Theft Auto, you've played a part of the Godfather. Godfather throws in some things like needing to pay off the police and an intimidation meter so it wont be a total clone. The targeting system is flawed but a little better than GTA's and the little map in the corner shows the actual street name not to look like another clone. If you like GTA, you might like this. If you liked the movie, you might enjoy this. If you're looking for something new...you wont find one bit of anything original."
4,fun game,I enjoyed playing this game and found myself being brought back into the movie as I was playing which made it more enjoyable.
3,Sorry to say,"When I first played of the game, when I created my character, I was hooked.It has great story lines and missions. Nice weapons (until you view them in the weapons screen and they are boxy and badly rendered)Good upgrade system for weapons, health, speed, street smarts, etc.It was very cool to be in the background of the movie so you were like the guy just waiting for his chance to take control or prove yourself.I loved the game until 2 major flaws appeared.#1 I got enough $$ for better clothes in order to increase the respect I get from local characters. When I chose a jacket or coat, as soon as I tried to ""save"" and ""Join the family"", the game locked up. I tried multiple times and it did it every time until I took off the coat.#2 When I took over every family and tried to return to the compound ""To discuss my future"", the game froze. It froze every time I reloaded and went to the compound. I can't see the ending because of this.Buy at your own risk. Maybe I got a defective disc."
5,the god father,great game great story mode puts you right in the film with things that couldve happened that we diddnt see in the film. great free roam
2,BORING!!!!! BORING!!! BORING!!!,"Let me start by saying I absolutely LOVE The Godfather movies (Part III.. not really). I really had high hopes for the game. I bought it on the first day it came out. I was disappointed at the low quality of graphics but was willing to overlook it if the game was really good. The game was not impressive at all. It was mediocre at best. Some of the missions were interesting (ex: trip to see the movie director), but after you complete all the missions, you must take control of all safehouses, hubs, businesses, etc. It really gets redundant: all of the clubs, brothels, hotels, etc. are exactly alike! Also, I think the chronology of the game would be confusing for someone who has never seen the Godfather before. I would have loved to do a Hyman Roth mission or a ""Kill Fredo"" mission lol.. Overall, I think the game is a HUGE disappointment. Please DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY! Oh yeah, I really felt like the game was GTA Godfather style.. only GTA is much better."
2,"how many grand theft auto games do we need, exactly?","if you've played grand theft auto, you've played this game. which i guess is good if you really love GTA and want to keep playing it again and again. it's the same even down to the map and having a safehouse. ""bully"" was a GTA ripoff too, but at least it had new interesting characters and story.. it would be nice if they made a godfather game in a different way."
2,This game is horrible!,Can you say repetitive? The game starts out fun. Admittedly I had a great time extorting businesses for money and raiding the factories of rival families. Then I came to the realization that the level design is absolutely the same for every type of building. When taking over a factory by force you can expect the same enemy pattern every single time. On the bright side the graphics aren't bad. With exception to the cars the game controls great. The cars are way too slow and steering is cumbersome. Rent this one. You'll enjoy the first few hours then come to your senses and realize that EA is simply trying to capitalize on the popularity of the Godfather license.
2,Major Glitch (not anymore),"During high speed chases the road would suddenly vanish from beneath the vehicle resulting in losing and having to start over again. When I slowed down during the same chase I would still lose because the other vehicle got too far ahead of me. I bought this game NEW, and factory sealed. The collectors addition. I still think it's a good game but I am going to have to return it because of the glitch. *UPDATE* I did return the game in exchange for another of the same. The glitch I mentioned before is not on the replaced game! May have been that the previous game had encountered the glitch during its process (a rarity) at the factory. Overall score now is 4 out of 5 STARS."
2,"the game hype try to infuse, then to be ana##@ defused!!!!!!!!!","this game is miserably ok to flat out sucks!!!!!!!! dont get me wrong, i love the godfather, but is nowhere near the movie..whats up with the character customization?? i think its a bad idea....if you were from another race or origin rather than italian,you know don corleone will be giving you the boot!!another thing is you see one building, you see them all!!!! they all look alike...!!! mafia ""the game"" was way better and it can be purchased for like 10 bucks i think??? official x-box magazine rates the godfather a 7.5...being not the best!! its not just me....lets hope scarface makes up for such a mess!!!"
4,good game,the game was great really takes some time to beat unlike most games i have played mafia and its not so good compared to this this has a great storyline and extra items to buy if your rich enough overall its a great game and if your into the whole mob thing this is the game to buy
4,you talkin' to me?,"This game is great. Both the missions and the things you do on your own (like extortion) make this game an awesome part of anyone's collection. I only found one thing wrong with the game. When you reach the rank of ""Don"", everyone still talks to you as i you were at the bottom of the barrel. For instance, when talking to one of the corleone men, they will still say something like, ""hey kid stay outta trouble"". This game, although great, can still use a little fine tuning."
5,GTA IN THE 1940'S,"This game is awesome. It's similar to GTA in the fact that you have control to walk around the city and steal cars, but then again it is also much more then GTA in the fact that you extort tons of businesses, take over warehouses and complete missions that are much more involved then GTA. You should definatley but this game!!!"
4,"A genuine, authentic Cajun cookbook","I grew up in south Louisiana. My family is Cajun. Tony Chachere's cookbook was one of the few cookbooks my mom used. It's the real deal. Not ""gourmet"" Cajun. Not Emeril's take on Cajun food. This is real Cajun cooking. It's not healthy in the least, but if you want to taste the way the food is supposed to taste, buy this book and follow the recipes exactly."
4,Good cajun cook book,I was lent this book and liked it enough I just had to go buy one for myself. Has plenty of pretty easy and authentic recipies.
2,El cheapo! Don't bother!,"I should have listened to the negative reviews. I bought 2 of these; one was for my office and the other for my house. This tea ball is hideously cheap and I'm expecting it to snap apart any day now. The latch to close it seems dangerous. You can probably slice a piece of your finger off if you're not paying attention. The quality of the mesh seems cheap and I'm almost afraid it's some kind of cheap, dangerous metal and not something safe to be steeping in hot water. I should have taken the trip to Bed, Bath & Beyond to be able to check out other types of tea balls before getting this model. I won't argue about the fact that it's big. It fits a lot of tea leaves in it. But its quality is lacking and there are definitely better ones out there."
3,large tea ball,works well and last for daily use for a month. okay for the price would try a larger one next time.
5,great,love this tea ball. it is great for loose tea lovers that like to put rock sugar in with their tea inside the ball!
1,Poor Construction,"I have no problem with the way these cut. I found that, unlike the way most clippers are designed, these have a small metal pin that holds the lever in place. This pin does not stay in very well. I have only used them a few times and found the pin had slipped almost completely out. Even when I pushed it back in it slid in with no effort so I know it will not stay together very long."
2,Awkward to use,"I don't like these at all! They are nice and sharp, but the part of the handle that you press down on in order to actually clip gets caught on the rest of the handle if it isn't lined up absolutely perfectly. The problem is that when you're trying to deal with tiny wiggly little fingers, it's hard to keep this part from swiveling slightly off center. You try to clip, and it gets stuck yet again. They're a pain to use. The handle needs to have a much wider channel for the top part to fit in."
4,"Nothing wrong, but better options available.","Nothing wrong with these clippers, they are sharp, cut nicely and fit securely in your hand. But I wish I had purchased the ones with the attached magnifying glass. Overall a nice product."
5,awesome nail clippers,"As a first time mom, I was really scared to cut my son's tiny nails. But with these clippers, it made my job easy. I love how bulky they are! You can really get a good grip on them while you're going to work on your child's nails. I am buying my second pair and a pair for my 3 of my friends who are expecting. Overall, great buy!!"
2,Just okay,"These clippers came pre-packaged with other baby safety items. They are very tiny, which I know is because babies have small fingernails, but because they are so small, I have to cut each nail twice; once on each side. If you have ever cut a baby's nails before, you know how hard it is to line up the clippers just once, not to mention twice. They also don't really cut completely through the nail. They will weaken it, but then you have to pull the nail off with your fingers to get it completely off. Because of this, there are a lot of jagged edges left that can scratch up my baby's face."
2,"ok product., but very nervious to use it.","It does it's job. However, it's very sharp and I cut my baby's finger twice. The problem is it's very small and hard to see my baby's finger nail. It always make me very nervious everytime I use it."
2,"Easy to use, but leave the nails soooo sharp!","These clippers work fine, the only problem for me is that they leave the nail edge a bit jagged and very, very sharp. I don't have this problem with other clippers I've used, just these. My baby winds up scratching herself and me. I think the First Years clippers w/ magnifying glass is a lot better for smoothing the nail while clipping it."
4,"easy handle, good to have it","it is easy to handle and hold. Just need to be sharper.So far, it works well."
5,the great indian wars dvd,I enjoyed the series. you will like it too. it is educational for adults as well as children about our heritage.
3,ehhhh,"Maybe I need to rewatch again, but this surf flick went beyond me. The surfing was ok, the artsyness of it all was a little over the top. Call me old, but this one wasnt one of my favorites, not even top 20. not top 30.. ehhh. its ok."
1,"Good surfing, bad everything else","Although the actual surfing footage in this film was awesome, most everything else was pretty disappointing. I was not that into the soundtrack, but I would be ok with that if the sound quality didn't totally suck. The narration is fuzzy and generally too quiet to be heard over the music. Not well mixed. Also, did not find the fake phone calls and gimicks entertaining. There's a lot of potential, but somebody botched it."
2,A good film but lacks in depth.,"It seems like there are so many ""surf films"" being produced lately that are throw togethers for magazine promotions. there is nothing really special about this dvd ... grat surfing footage but nothing you can't find accompanying magazines for free (price of the mag.Sorry... not a hater, just didn't think it was that great."
2,Track List,"1-calimin y chulumin, 2-el chorro, 3-una cerveza, 4-papi tu, 5-mar azul, 6-triangulo de amor, 7-ya viene el lunes, 8-quiero hacerte el amor, 9-muevete, 10-quien no ha pedido perdon, 11-dame in chin, 12-bebo, bebo"
3,"Instructions -Thumbs up, Projects Thumbs down","Excellently illustrated Instructions; so I passed the book along to a new crocheter to use as a reference. The projects are very avant-garde but are executed in yarns that are chunky and the projects look ugly (my 18 year old found them less than appealing). Perhaps with vision you could take their ideas and create something you really like, but I couldn't (24 years as a crocheter)."
4,Another great story!,"This is not exactly the genre I choose from when selecting books...but I'm so glad I chose this series! The author writes with finesse and an understanding of conditions and cultures that most people turn aside from. I'm reading the 4th book in the series, have enjoyed each of them, and look forward to reading more by Ms. Padgett."
4,I LIKE BO BRADLEY,"AFTER READING THIS THIRD NOVEL IN THE SERIES I FEEL LIKE BO AND HER FRIENDS ARE MY FRIENDS. THEY ALL PULL TOGETHER TO HELP ANOTHER CHILD AND TO SOLVE A MYSTERY. BO'S DISORDER LEADS HER IN SEEING TRUTHS THAT OTHERS CAN'T SEE. MENTAL ILLNESS CAN BE A BURDEN BUT GIVES BO SOME SPECIAL INSIGHTS. FOLLOW HER IN THIS SERIES, SEE HER GROWTH AND WONDER AT HER ABILITY TO COPE. AGAIN THIS STORY GIVES A SPECIAL MESSAGE ABOUT A DIFFERENT CULTURE AND THE PLIGHT OF THE MAYA. AND I LOVE THE DECRIPTIVE LOOK AT THE LANDSCAPE AROUND BO. DON'T MISS THESE SPECIAL PEOPLE THAT YOU WILL MEET IN THESE NOVELS. YOU WILL BE GLAD THAT THEY BECOME A PART OF YOUR FAMILY."
2,A good lesson in shoestring budget movie making.,"This movie has become a late-night favorite of Cinemax and the USA Network's ""Up All Night."" Filmed in 1991 in Austin, TX, this ultra-low-budget comedy was a multiple nominee in the 1994 Drive-In Movie Academy Awards (""The Hubbies""), and is great viewing for anyone interested in creating or otherwise involving themselves in the area of low-budget movie making. When that wears thin, there are always ""catgirls"" to look at. The important lesson aspiring filmmakers should derive from this movie is what it looks like on screen when blue filters are used on the camera lens to simulate nightime during daylight shots (i.e., scrape up the extra money and BUY SOME LIGHTS). As a final note, this Troma Team release is well worth the price as a collector's item alone -- Lance Henry's feature film speaking-role debut as ""The Paperboy"" is only sure to rise in price. END"
5,Teenage Catgirls In Heat,"Excellentato! I remember first seeing this movie on cable and for a low budget movie, this one was Awesome. One of my favorites from Troma to date. Meoww."
2,Save your money,"Alot of Troma movies are out of print and its hard to find them at a good price. Teenage Catgirls in Heat is one of those movies and it hovers around the 40 dollars for a copy of the movie. Dont worry, your not missing too much. The movie is hard to see because its dark most of the movie and so what if there are naked girls. There is alot of better looking naked girls in other Troma films. All in all, a disappointment and im glad I didnt pay 40 bucks for this."
3,Female verion of TOMCAT,"Cats are turned into seductive women stalking the men about town. Only after kitty plays, she kills. It was all right. But, I prefer the story and cat-like portrayal in ""TOMCAT: Dangerous Desires"" with Richard Grieco.--that's terrific."
2,"Sad, very sad","The DVD was a lot better than the movie it contained. The movie could have been soooo much better (more of the girls would have been a good start), but the extra's almost made up for the price. There's previews and tours of Troma studio's and photo galleries and clips. There's also not much else I can add."
4,Thought Provoking,"Despite Atomic's rather unfair review, this book serves its purpose - to help the reader search his/her soul, encourage spirituality & provoke thinking in a direction possibly not taken prior to reading the book. I enjoyed every page and found myself a better person for having read it. I laughed out loud, I cried, I had ""light bulb"" moments - what a book!"
2,God's Joyful Surprise,"The book is written in a 'stream of consciousness' style and was not compelling like ""The Secret Life of Bees""."
2,THIS RECORD IS BUNK !,"I HAVE LISTEN TO COMPTON'S GREATEST RAP:VOL1 SEVERAL TIMES IN MY CAR THIS PAST WEEK. IT WASN'T WHAT I EXPECTED IT TO BE.I WAS HOPING TO HEAR SOME OF THE OLD UNDERGROUND SH*T FROM BACK IN THE DAY. WELL, I GUESS ITS NOT THE LABELS FAULT,BUT RATHER THE PRODUCERS."
2,pretty item but doesn't work well,This washes well and looks nice but the curve on the handle part is too steep causing the spoon to fall off. The handle should be flat. You can't tell from the picture but it just doesn't work well.
4,This is funny,"This is one of those weird films that is funny in a way you don't expect. My wife and I first rented this show in about '96 and often talked about it later. It's one of those shows that just sticks in your head. I finally bought a used VHS copy because it doesn't appear to be on DVD. Of course, I thought ""Falling Down"" was a feel good movie."
5,"Tan extraordinario como su antecesor, el que","va dirigido al adulto joven...Es un encuentro con la mitad de la vida, pero NOS ENSEÑA A QUE SEA UN ENCUENTRO GOZOZO !Toca todo lo que nos afecta a esa edad: Los hijos que se van, la menopausia, la muerte de algunos amigos o conocidos de nuestra misma edad (Ese capítulo es divino! Se llama ""Los Dinosaurios Comienzan a Desfilar "" )Y nos ilumina el camino para adaptarnos a ESTA SEGUNDA MITAD DE LA VIDA,PERO CON GOSO, CON UN SENTRDO DEL HUMOR MUY MEXICANO PERO MUY FEMENINO... Por ejemplo, sus viajes al espejo...ja ja !"
2,"Cool author, light reading, disappointing text","This is a collection of prose pieces from an artist that usually works in poetry. Possibly as a result, the pieces are short and light. The author is influenced by early 20th-century British authors who would write about pastoral things like landscapes and such. The book is divided into two parts: the first is a fact-based fictional account of individuals at a 19th-century fort in Colorado, the second part is a collection of essays on modern and historical topics. This book had a great essay on Walt Whitman's possible racism toward Natives and a wonderful essay on the vulgarity of Mount Rushmore. Nevertheless, I didn't particularly enjoy this work. ... If I met this author in person, something tells me he would be one of the coolest, most progressive guys around. But I didn't care for this particular text."
4,A Prayer For The City,This was fabulously written. Rendell is at times wonderfully contumacious because of his love for Philadelphia. And David Cohen is pure genius! I highly recommend this to anyone. I have just given it to my neighbor to read.
2,"Appeals to the emotions, not to the mind","I was disappointed with this book, because the author maintains that one man ""decided to save"" the city from bankruptcy and self-destruction. There are simpler and, at the same time, more sophisticated explanations. I'll indicate two here: a city's unsustainable finances are, well, unsustainable. A financial crisis necessitates a remedy, so that any remedy was imposed is no surprise. Second, the entire economy performed well in the 1990's, so the fact that Philadelphia did comparatively well coming out of the modest recession of the early 1990's is, again, no big surprise.There are some nicely crafted segments of this book, and there are pleny of hastily crafted segments. For readers who like vignettes about real people, there are a handful of those. Readers who would have preferred some thoughtful observations or commentary on political economy should look elsewhere."
4,The human side of politics,"Not just a book about a mayor but a book about how people interact with their city and view their mayor as the father of their city and the solver of all problems. So many people try and compare running a political organization like a mayor's office and city government to be ing a company CEO, but this book shows that the comparison is shallow becuase city residents - especially in our urban centers - want much more from a city than customers want from a company. there is an emotional attachment to one's city.The book is very well written and moves along at a nice pace, while still taking time to show the details of people's lives that make us care for them and make their charachters come alive."
2,"Interesting Information, BUT",While the information contained in this book is worthy of attention. I can't help feeling that I might been able to find all of this information for free on the web. It is more like a pamphlet than a book.
2,Totally Confusing,"This movie is totally mixed-up and very confusing! It is supposed to have a Christian message with sci-fi included, but it sends very mixed messages. Hel-lo! This is supposed to be a Christian movie, but it includes witchcraft when the Lieutenant makes things happen because of her powers. That is not Christianity in any way, sort, or form. Plus, it is an insult to people in the military. Military members are supposed to help the community, not hurt the community! I find it creepy-very creepy. I felt something weird come over me in this movie. I also felt very defiled after I had watched it. However, I do appreciate that it expresses how God has power over satan (his name should not be capitalized.) This is the worst movie that I have seen Cloud Ten Pictures produce. However, Left Behind the Movie and Left Behind the Movie II: Tribulation Force and The Miracle of the Cards are great movies that are a must-see."
2,I've been Diced like a Potato,"This is my synopsis of the plot. Magic is evil because it's bad; so the bad guys with the magic have to be bad because there evil. The good guys who are nobodies have to be good because they don't have magic. Get it?The 'villain' of the story was a funny `magic' sound on a pair of head phones. The head phones kind of got addictive, and no body wanted to share. -See Bad.I will give credit where credit is due though. With the acting and music scores, the movie actually didn't turn out to be as bad as I make it sound. It was watch-able if you're willing to neglect the basic tenants of the story.PS: and I have to say: I was so thoroughly impressed with Ramona Milano's acting I'm dying to see her star in a real Hollywood movie!..."
1,Very Deceiving!,Boring;little action in plot. Very diluted;few references to the Bible. Felt more like I was watching one of those awfully boring Sunday afternoon movies than a Christian movie with Biblical content. Not edifying a bit! I regret having purchased such a thing!
3,SUPPOSE TO BE A CHRISTIAN MOVIE,THIS WAS SO NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE I WISH I HAD RENTED IT BEFORE BUYING IT.
5,A Must Have!!!,Shows that Christians can entertain and keep the intrest of the viewer as well as Hollywood big guns.
3,Surprisingly Good,"I was pleasantly surprised by this DVD. I was expecting a low budget, poorly made film but what I saw was a well acted, believable premise that entertained me completely. Judd Nelson is very believable as the skeptic. In fact, he makes the film. I've always liked Nelson as an actor and in this film his talents show. Even though this is a low budget effort the finished product is quality."
3,Easy to carry,"Fits in pocket,purse,glovebox,desk or locker at work. Always good to have nearby especially when you are going to eat out or at work. Does dry my hands if I use too often,"
5,Best eye make-up remover by far,"I got a sample of this when I bought some make up and used it up right away. This product is the most gentle I've used and gets everything off without feeling as though you're destroying the soft tissue around your eyes! Expensive, yes; but worth every penny!"
5,Best Makeup Remover,"Purchased as a gift. Product arrived quickly, was wrapped and sealed by manufacturer, and fresh. You will know it's fresh if the bottle seal is in place and the contents have not yet separated. Once the seal is removed and air gets to it, the soulution separates and needs to be gently mixed before use. It is more costly than other makeup removers but is by far the fastest and most gentle. As a pro tip: you can use it for cleansing the eyes, the lips and the entire face. It's an awesome product to keep in your makeup kit."
5,Mexican Train A Hit!,"I purchased this for our residents at our senior retirement community, The Oaks of Louisiana. They absolutely loved it! Nice case to store also, not that it's getting much storage time. Great buy!"
3,"ok, but not great or terrible","This cd is most certainly not one of the best metal albums, however if slow and low music (forgive the rhyme) with barked vocals is your thing this is one album you might want to buy."
3,No Need,"There was no need for this book. It doesn't answer any questions, the story goes nowhere new."
3,No Need,"There was no need for this book. It doesn't answer any questions, the story goes nowhere new.Why write a story that takes place after the ending of the Prisoner series when in the last episode you find out the whole series was allegory rather than simply just a story about a secret agent?A story that could have been considered a ""missing episode"" of the series would have good. A story that could have told us more about Number 6 before he became The Prisoner would have been even better."
4,A pleasant surprise,"Reading manuals often rise new questions. How does this function actually work? As owner of many cameraes and manuals for these cameras, I am glad to discover eager folks getting behind all the functions with such great skill. Nikon Coolpix 4500 manual are of the better kind, but still a manual.This book got me behind all unique functions of the Nikon Coolpix 4500 and made me see all the posibilities of the well made camera. The combination book & CD works just fine. The book in B&W; and CD in color first seemed odd, but after all make sens. The moment the book get worn out, just print out a new one! (remeber the copyright!).Bying this book was my first bye from Amozon.com. It worked just great and I got the book by mail according to the the promised price and date! Just great.I recomend this book for those wanting to realy getting most out of the Excelent Nikon Coolpix 4500."
1,"Poorly organized, factually inaccurate","To give this book some credit, it seems to be written from a criminal justice perspective. However, I'm not sure it's the best approach. I found the book difficult to follow in terms of organization. It also has some factual inaccuracies - for example, White claims that the terrorist wing of Lebanese Hizballah was founded by Fathi al-Shiqaqi. Shiqaqi founded the Palestine Islamic Jihad, a completely different organization, a fact which is easily checked, but missed by the author and his editors. If you are looking for a good survey on terrorism, there are many better ones available."
1,Inaccurate,"I found this book to be inaccurate in many ways. It was incredibly biased. ALF is labeled as an ecoterrorist, which they are not. ALF helps liberate animals from cruelty. Besides the fact that ALF was labeled as a terrorist, information given about them was severly wrong. It is stated that ALF incourages its members to wear leather gloves. That is completely false. Any animal rights advocate knows that leather is a dead animals skin, ALF members would not wear leather. I could go on all day."
1,What a waste of money!!,"The CDs are this guy reading the inputs, tools and outputs, there is no value added in how the material is presented. You would get more if you had someone read the PMBOK to you. Don't waste your time or money. If I could give negative stars, I would."
3,OK,"Although the book is chock-full of beautiful Scarry artwork, the text is dry and not very kid-friendly."
5,Summerslam 1992 - A Masterpiece!!!,"this was one of the greatest Summerslams for two big reason: the warrior-savage match, and the hart-bulldog match. I don't know which was better, maybe bret-bulldog, but both were outstanding. the rest of the card is good, so I recommend you make every effort to get this tape!!!!!!"
1,CRAP PPV DONT WASTE MONEY,K 1ST OFF RANDY VS WARRIOR THEY WERE BOTH WEARING PINK THAT WAS BAD THAN MATCH WAS JUST OK.THEN THE IC MATCH WITH BRET I WAY OVERRATED NOT GOOD AT ALL DONT KNOW WHY SO MANY LOVE IT NO GOOD SPOTS IT ENDS IN ROLL UP OUT OF NO WERE DUMB MATCH.PS RANDY WAS WEARING LIGHT PINK.
5,Great book!!!,"I found this book to be easy to read and use. Yes, sometimes it does call for different ingredients, which make for a different taste. That's one thing that makes it special. It is not just the usual rehashed recipes for the same old breads. The breads, and the absolutely BEST sticky buns I have ever tasted, turn out beautiful to look at and delicious to eat. I have been using breadmachines for at least 10 years and have numerous books. This is one of my favorites."
3,More difficult that title would imply,"I haven't tried a lot of the recipes yet, and here's the problem. Most of the recipes require ingredients that a normal kitchen doesn't have. I make bread regularly and I do have most of the common stuff, but it seemed whenever I looked at a recipe it wanted stuff I would have to go shop for. Like soy flour, minced jalapeno peppers, barley flakes, natural bakers bran, fine semolina flour, powdered saffron, millet, etc.Yes, they're easy, but what bread machine recipe isn't?"
4,Lightm minimalist humor that generates smiles rather than guffaws,"According to the author, a droodle is a simple drawing with a nonsense and humorous caption associated with it. Some examples are the clam with buck teeth, a hive of ants walking through spilled champagne, a man playing trombone in a telephone booth, the leaning tower of pizzas and a foul ball as seen by Roy Campanella. While many of the combinations of drawing and text are of the groaner variety, there are some that are very funny.This is a form of minimalist humor; most of the drawings are so simple a child could create them. The humor is based on the incongruity of the description, as without that, the diagram will most likely make no sense. It is light, simple humor, the kind that generates smiles rather than guffaws."
5,great AG short story,"History, a great story and an authentic historical craft! Not only that, but just the right size for girl-sized hands. A+++++++ Cannot be beat!"
1,Confusing,"Unfortunatly, this is the only book that I have found that is appropriate for toddlers.Because preschoolers and toddlers take adults words very literally, and generally think of death as something reversible, ""The Goodbye Boat"" is not a good good book to explain death. In the book, the grandmother dies and sails around on a ship. This gives children the impression that when people die, they go on a boat ride and eventually return.This book is very confusing for young children. A good alternative would be ""When Dinosaurs Die"""
4,The GoodBye Boat,"Simple, easy to understand, maybe a bit too simple, seems specific to losing a grandparent, could be less about a grandparent and include different members of a family. Bought this for my 3 year old granddaughter that's lost her Daddy. Not sure if she'll think she may be losing her Nana soon. Still so little out there written for a very young person. Seems like we mostly believe only older people die."
2,Too small and too light,"I bought these to pratice hitting in the back yard with my 6 year old. I pitch him the balls. Previously, I had a few 'rawlings' foam balls that I used with him, which were great. They were the same size as a regular baseball and they had enough weight to that made them easy to throw. These Diamond balls are smaller than a baseball. They are also too light. I find it harder to throw them accurately. I'll be on the search for those old rawlings balls or something with a little more size and heft."
3,OK for white or light colored card stock,"I am new to card making and wanted the ability to dry emboss them. This light box is disappointing in that the light is only bright in the center. The other problem is you must use only white or very light colored card stock. I wanted to use this to make Christmas cards only to discover that even medium colored paper is too dark to see the stencil, making it worthless for my project. I gave it three stars because if you stay with light colored paper and use stencils that are not much larger than three inches it will get the job done."
2,Not As Advertised: No AC Adapter Included,"The descriptions of this product, both here on Amazon and on Artograph's own website, state that an AC adapter is included. But the product I received from Amazon DID NOT include this adapter and, in fact, the packaging clearly says ""Optional operation with 9V AC Adapter (not included)"". This is really annoying as the inclusion of an adapter was a significant factor in my purchasing decision. Now I have to go somewhere like Radio Shack to buy an adapter, hope it has sufficient wattage, and pay at least 50% of the price of the product itself to get one. Very disappointing."
5,Fantastic buy...best money ever spent,"Bought this for my wife in September and she loves it! It has made her life SO much easier when baking/cooking...she doesn't know how she ever did it without one. I bought the remanufactured, in black, and it came looking brand new. Not a scratch on it. It has worked flawlessly since day one...what a buy."
2,Good camera.......for one year only,"This camera was everything I could ask for. Great color, quality, and all the pictures could be blown up easily with clear resolution. Then, after about a year,it started flashing ""ZOOM ERROR"" and won't take pictures anymore. Since this camera is only backed by a one year warrenty, I'm going to have to pay an extra $60 to get it fixed. I am sick of products being made to not last. I don't recommend this product."
4,fujit,Good camera. Got it for my daughter. No viewfinder just the digital screen and lens. 6.3 megapixel with 3X optical zoom and pretty good resolution and color for under $100 refurbished. I rarely like to buy refurbished goods but I've been pleasantly surprised at how well the cameras held up. My daughter is looking forward to using the camera for the holidays coming up. She took some nice pictures on halloween.
1,The worst customer service!!!,The camera is fine as long as nothing goes wrong. Fuji has the worst customer service I have ever delt with. They pass you from one person to another and do everything they can not to help you. Be prepared to deal with the worst customer service in the business. I really hope this helps you.
1,Not Like Your Other Fuji!,"I bought this as a point and shoot because I can't stick my S5000 in my shirt pocket and I'm pretty happy with my two other Fuji's. But, this one is different. The metering is way off, even when I shoot it on manual and adjust the white balance the results are not as good as with my old MX 1700. Additionally, the focus is not as crisp as with my other 2 Fuji's.Although it has some nice features it does not not fulfill the basic function of a decent quality point and shoot."
5,Injustices of life thrust upon some,"This movie was haunting. It is a day after I watched it and I cannot stop thinking about it. Without giving any thing away, the judges and lawyers and everyone involved should be fired and never put in a position of power again. Zacharys grandparents had so much taken from them, and yet they remain strong and commited. They have my sincere admiration."
5,I was okay until..,"I read the reviews before watching this documentary and half way through I thought it would end with happiness, with Grandma and Grandpa finally getting the baby but it didn't. That is when my heart sank and my stomach became upset. I hurt for these beautiful grandparents and I don't understand how or why this murderess was so evil as to take such precious things from them. It just makes me want to hug all the people I love and hold dear. It is just not right what happened!!! My heart breaks."
4,"If you aren't weeping by film's end, you are not human","In a nutshell, if you aren't in a weepy state by the end of this film you likely aren't human. That said, its for the best if you go into your initial screening of this documentary knowing as little as possible about the events that comprise this narrative. If you're in the mood for a fairly riveting crime documentary and also in need of a cathartic emotional release by way of some serious misty-eyed action - look no further than this disc. Some points are docked for the cheapo, vid quality of this production but if you can look past that you're in for one heck of an emotional roller-coaster with this one."
3,Disconcerting,"Actually this is a very good documentary. Different format than most and well-done on that front. And it is probably my own fault I didn't enjoy it more. The description revealed there was a murder involved in Zachary losing his father. I usually will not watch any movie with violence in it. I thought it was just going to be a warm fuzzy ""Wow, kid, look what a great guy your Dad was"" movie. But it had more of a focus on the murder aspect than I liked. And the ending was most uncomfortable to watch. Good statement documentary, but not the 'feel good' movie I had hoped for."
3,Average,"The story told by this documentary was sad, but I thought the documentary itself was pretty average. I'm suspicious of all these reviews saying that this documentary 'changed my life.' I even read on some totally unrelated message board that this is a 'life-changing documentary.' It makes me think there is some type of guerilla underground Internet marketing going on.I wouldn't expect anyting life-changing from this documentary but it may be worth watching if you can catch it for free on TV."
5,This will haunt you forever,"The most emotionally moving thing I've ever seen on DVD. I couldn't forget Andrew, Zachary or Mr & Mrs Bagby if I tried...nor do I want to. I hope those fools in Canada who allowed this to happen were made to watch it as well. There is much to be learned here. God bless this family."
5,Such a sad story,I had seen this movie before. Such a sad story in how the system failed in so many ways. Such a tagic loss of a good doctor and a innocent little boy.
5,Heartbreaking til the end,"Totally unexpected ending, unbelievable story ...a real and true story. Begun out of love and admiration & unfolding into the telling of someones reality of life. Expertly described example of the choices people make and how they can cause a huge ripple. Bravo. Painful to watch but interesting none the less"
4,Any student of Toynbee should read,"I confess I only read D. C. Somervell's abridgment of Arnold Toynbee's first six volumes A Study of History, so I cannot claim to be a student of his work, but I was impressed mightily by that reading. This biography of Toynbee by the eminent historian William H. McNeill is of consistent interest and does not fail to relate Toynbee's troubled personal life as well as explore his eminent historical writing life. After reading this bio I concluded that Toynbee's theories and prophecies have not proved overly valid. E.g., he feared the U.S. more than Soviet Russia, and that is a novel and unspportable fear to me, naturally. Toynbee, along with most great thinkers, did not foresee the Soviet collapse. I think an interesting work would be an exploration of the why so many people looked on Communism as the wave of the future, even including Whittaker Chambers. Does anyone know of a good book exploring that phenomenon?"
5,Doesn't get any better than this...,Love the series. Great acting...feels like slipping into a comfortable pair of shoes watching this show!
5,Always good for a laugh,I love this show....Judy Dench plays a loveable character whose well intentioned meddling always gets her in trouble. Classic show.
5,Love it :),"Quality writing. Stories. Interesting, realistic (well, mostly) people with interesting lives. Capable of a humorous raised eyebrow, but without needing sleaze. What's not to like? This is TV as it should be."
3,Replacement Dubet,We bought this duvet to replace another identical duvet that was purchased recently. The first one came apart--the edge cording was not properly fixed at the end seam--but we didn't have the receipt (it was bought at a major dept store at an end of season sale last spring) and didn't want to have to replace all the matching bedding purchased with the duvet.We bought this piece because the sale price was comparable to the cost of having the other one repaired by a local upholsterer.We previously had another Waterford duvet that had worn very well for a number of years and expect that the defective piece was a fluke. Time will tell but so far so good.
4,"I Feel Honored That I,m The First To Write You.","I read one of your books it was called The Summer Birds.This particular book put some questions in my mind.One of them was,Why could only certain peole see the boy?I like fictinal books.I like them because people can do special things.Are their any more books I should read?"
2,Good overall but inner steel layer of blade does rust,"I have this exact knife. I could not find from printed literature if the M66 center hard steel layer that makes the cutting edge would rust or not. After it arrived I put it on the cutting board with a little water and 3 hours latter rust all along the M66 steel cutting edge. This may not be important to some who are used to rustable carbon steel but I like fully rust free tools. Otherwise I like this knife, good fit and finish, comfortable handle, very sharp, OK balance. I also placed a Shun Classic knife in the same test and it did not rust at all and it has a larger handle more to my liking with my large hands."
4,Tool belt,Good product. Only negative is that the fabric is much darker (maroon) than the picture depicts.
1,NOT what it implys,"Very disappointed in this product. It leads you to believe it's the roller that has an extended handle....It's NOT.Just a regular short handle...note it says ""by Helmac Extension Handle, and NOT is Helmac Extension Handle.Be wary of fine print. Since it's 50% the cost to send it back, the only solution is to pay extra for an extension handle to be able to use on floors. Somewhat of a bait and switch."
2,The Oxford Russian Dictionary,"This book is good for those who speak English and have a good English background. However, this book is not convenient for kids or new learners. It has no pronouncing tips of words which is important for everybody. Personally I would not suggest buy this book. It is better to buy dictionary with pronouncing tips. When I bought this book I did not know that it has no word pronouncing tips. In addition it would be a good idea for sellers to give detailed information about their products. My family found this book inconvenient to use."
2,Lacks Russian pronounciation,I was disappointed that there is no guide to the pronounciation of the Russian words. My desktop English dictionary gives the phonetic spelling of English words. So why not a Russian-English dictionary that gives the phonetic spelling of the Russian words?
1,waste of money,"Yes, it was an inexpensive book, and now I know why! What a huge disappointment. If you don't already know how to speak/read Russian, then this is NOT the book to get. It literally just gives the English and Russian words, but no phonetics so you have no idea how to pronounce the word in Russian, rendering the book useless. I would return it for a refund, but postage would cost more than the book itself, so I'm stuck with it! Goodwill maybe?"
3,"good words, bad printing","I am studying Russian in advance of a vacation I plan this summer; I am using a combination of tapes, software (useless by itself), books, primer, and a Russian aquaintance at work. I got this book because it was inexpensive, small, and contained both an excellent selection of words and some of the grammatical concepts. Unfortunately, it suffers from poor paperback quality printing. The low end paper used for the pages allowed some ink seepage; this makes the Cyrillic script, which I am still mastering, difficult to read in some places particularly when it comes to distinguishing the lower case forms of ""na"" (looks like an H only smaller) and ""yi"" (looks like a backwards N).It does contain good information, but I would not recommend it if you need reading glasses or prefer to read in low light."
4,Must have resource for learning Russian.,"I thought that this dictionary was great for aiding in learning the Russian language. However, you can't rely on this dictionary alone to learn the language, it is meant to be a reference book.For the cost of the book, it is a good value. I went elsewhere because I wanted the book right away and paid double the Amazon price (still not expensive, but I could have saved some money).I would definitely take some time to work on learning the Cyrillic alphabet before diving into this dictionary head first. The pronouncation is going to be very difficult, so audio CDs or taking a class on Russian would definitely be a huge benefit."
2,Good and Bad,"I've had this dictionary since the first year of my Russian studies, and I've appreciated this dictionary for both it's inclusion of all of the words I'd been looking up and it's small size - easy to carry around in a backpack. However, this year I've started getting into higher level russian with a greater variety of vocabulary words in the reading assignments. Recently this dictionary has been failing me more and mor, making it neccesary to turn to my classmate's dictionaries, which is quite a bother. A year or two ago I would have given this dictionary a five star rating, but that has significantly gone down since I've realized how insufficient this dictionary has been for me."
2,Might be good if it were readable.,"The two best things about this dictionary are that it is very light weight and inexpensive. It appears to be a good reference, however the print is so small and blurry that I can't read it even with my reading glasses on. Hence, the low rating. Fortunately, for my recent trip to Ukraine, I also brought the excellent but very heavy and large, dictionary by Kenneth Katzner."
3,Ruck Rising To The Top,"Knowledgeable hip-hop heads know that Sean P was formerly known as Ruck, one half of the legendary duo Heltah Skeltah. After blazing the New York city streets throughout the mid-nineties then fading into obscurity, Sean Price breaks the silence with his solo debut, Monkey Barz.Rather than spend 50 minutes mulling over the old days, Price proves that he can change with the times. Equipped with a chopped vocal sample from Justus League producer Khrysis, and an imposing chorus from Tek, Sean spits fierce rhymes on the lead single ""Onion Head,"" which just demands his rightful respect. He raps about everything he loves on the outstanding ""Heartburn"" over 9th Wonder's soothing violin backdrop and admits to receiving four-dollar royalty checks on the revealing interlude, ""Brokest Rapper You Know.""Armed with strong BCC cameos and seamless production from a variety of beatsmiths, Monkey Barz show us that Sean P still has a position on hip hop's playground. 3.5 Stars"
4,Very good album overall with a few exceptions,"For the most part this is an awesome album, but there are few songs that didn't quite fit:Fake Neptune- The beat sound was a little off and kind of poppy.Heartburn- The snares and hi-hats were turned up to high this one. The NYC feeling just isn't there on this one at all.Shakedown- Snares and Hi-hats were off on this one also.Mad Mann- The same goes for this song, as well.The rest of album was excellent. I plan on picking up Buckshot & 9th Wonder next!!"
4,NYce one...,"i think to truly appreciate this album you'd have to follow ""nocturnal"" and ""magnum force""... now i know what some of you are thinking, ""why do hella people keep refering to the ""ruck and rock albums""? ... because they're tight work together... don't get me wrong, these two mc's are right on point by themselves but they do major damage together... anyways, sean p comes out with his vibe that he is known for... but i'll be a bit too real, for me i only like almost every other track but i really listen to like 5 tracks on this album... but i'm biased because i followed them since nocturnal, even though i'm from the west coast i always gave some love to some east coast rhymes... in the end, i think he coulda came out a bit more better, but that's why the 4 stars..."
5,learned,This might not be as in depth as some people want but I did learn quit a bit from this video. I'm glad I bought it. We have already made some changes on our horses that they suggested and wow. Thanks for some great tips.
5,Fabulous!,"I've been using the Aplio since it first came out. What a long way it's come, the sound quality is great - especially since it's free long distance, and the delay isn't too bad either. I really really REALLY need Aplio! My fiance (Martine) lives in Peru, so we use it to keep our relationship strong until we're married. It's also given me a chance to get to know his parents better. Martine's sister in Texas also has an Aplio, so they can stay in touch with her too (for free). What a crazy family we make huh?"
4,Best Burnout Yet,"With a name like Burnout Revenge, you might expect the latest game in the series to be a little rougher, a little meaner. And you'd be right. While it isn't a total reinvention, Burnout Revenge makes significant alterations to the Burnout formula that essentially render every other game in the series obsolete.Burnout Revenge might not be the revolution that Burnout 3 was, but in the end, it changes more than enough to make it feel like a very different game. It's a technical marvel, but more importantly than that, it's one of the most exciting racing games ever made. Unless you don't have the reflexes to handle it, Burnout Revenge is a must-own game, especially for fans of online competition."
4,Great sequel,EA have done a bang up job with Burnout Revenge. Although gameplay has hasn't changed that much and only minor improvemnts were made this is nothing short of spectacular. I would have to give this 4.5 out of 5 2 thumbs up all the way
2,Not all it's cracked up to be!,"This is exactly the same Easy Bake Oven I had as a kid and as then, it's still a joke. It still heats with a 60 watt light bulb. My daughters were so disappointed with this toy. They expected to make cakes and brownies just like the pictures showed. Instead, they got a tiny bit of nasty tasting batter that baked up into a hard, unpalatable disc! The ""frosting mix"" was even worse. I'm sorry I gave Easy Bake another shot. Don't waste your money!"
1,"Rubber melts, porcelain cracks, handle is hot",We had this kettle for about a year. The rubber melts. The handle doesn't work (it gets hot). The porcelain cracked and chipped. Now it needs to be replaced. Do not buy this kettle.
1,Dollar store quality at department store prices? Who can resist!,"I loved my old red KitchenAid kettle so much, and had it for so long, that when itfinally broke, I tried to replace it with this imposter, ignoring thereviews about how the paint chips off after two weeks. Well, the paint didchip off, and the gaskets broke, so now the handle wiggles.I've only been using this thing for a couple of months, and it's beyond ready to bejunked. If you want to ignore everyone's warnings, like I did, go ahead and buy it.I assure you, it will bring you several days of cute tea kettle enjoyment."
1,Peeled Enamel & Melted Silicone,"I've used this kettle 2-3 times a week for about 2 months. After a couple of weeks, the silicone near the spout melted, possibly because the spout was not fully closed when I put it on the stove to boil, but still...Now, there is a 3-inch piece of enamel that has peeled off the kettle. I've never put it in the dishwasher or wiped it with anything other than soap and water, maybe once a week.And I also want to note that my husband has been complaining about this kettle since he burnt his hand on the handle the first time he went to use it. The silicone does not fully over the handle, so you still have to use an oven mitt when handling it.I will definitely be demanding a replacement or preferably a refund, as this kettle is obviously faulty."
2,Kitchen Aid Tea Kettle,"I purchased this item at a local store and paid over $40 for it. It was good for about one year. On the outside its BEAUTIFUL but the inside started to rust. I have to admit that after I make tea I can't get every drop of hot water out, so water does stay at the bottom, which is possibly what caused this. But unless you have the time to dry it out each time you use it I would not recommend this product. I have two jobs and I am always on the go, I don't have time to worry about water left in a tea kettle. But for the price I would have expected it to last a little longer. I am going with a glass tea kettle now."
2,Inside Finish Flakes Off Into Your Water,"We bought this tea kettle, and absolutely loved it. Unfortunately, after about a year of what was frankly not very much use, the finish on the inside of the kettle began to flake off into the water. We eventually had to throw it away because the water was filled with gray flakes of whatever the finish is made of. Worked great, except for the part where we were concerned it could be poisoning us."
2,Not as advertised,"I love the look and feel of the teakettle. however, the review says the handle is heat proof, it is not. It gets very hot and you must use an oven glove."
1,So Sad !,"I was so looking forward to my new kettle, it was very quick and very good servise, but the kettle started to rust inside just after 2 weeks of use.So I had to get other one .....a different kind..."
2,Major design flaw with the handle,"The silicone grip does not fully surround the metal of the handle, which means you can't pick it up with a normal hand grip without burning yourself on the exposed metal. I need to use a towel or oven mitt to pick it up, which entirely defeats the purpose of buying a kettle with a silicone grip."
1,Not as expected. Do not buy!!!,"I' am very upset about this purchase. I bougth this teakettle 5 months ago and the base is cracked. I have always been very careful when using it, so I do not understand what happened. I bought this teakettle confident in the quality of the brand, but I'm very disappointed.Porcelain cracking every day. You can view the photos..."
2,Silicone Not Holding Up,"This tea kettle has been in almost daily use for the past year. I love the color and we've no complaint with the whistle, nor have we had pouring problems. You do have to use a pot holder on the handle because the heat-resistant silicone only covers the top and bottom leaving the sides of the very hot metal handle open to the hand grasping it; clearly a design problem. In addition the silicone on the lever of the spout cover has split and is separating from the metal creating another source of possible burns, and this one is not easily rectified by use of a pot holder. A disappointing product from Kitchenaid."
4,Nice but pricey,This is a nice product but a little over priced. It will not whistle if filled too full which is about half full.
2,Not happy,"I have had the worst luck with this tea kettle. It is very cute and looks great on the stove, but there are so many problems with it that I threw it away this morning. First of all, neither the lid nor the spout fit tightly, so steam escapes around the lid, making it hard to grasp the handel and pour the water. Speaking of pouring the water, it pours terribly. Maybe I should have filled the kettle more, but I don't like to wait to boil more water than I need. You have to tilt the kettle so much to get any water out of it. It sputters a lot too. And last week it stopped whistling altogether. I've had it about 3 months. I guess looks aren't everything!"
4,tea kettle,"I like the look of this kettle and the handle does not get as hot as other tea kettles I have had. It seems to be well built and looks nice in our kitchen. I would have prefered a trigger device to open the spout instead of the little handle on the the end of it. Overall, very happy with it."
3,Looks great - drips and didn't whistle,I loved the look and am familiar with the brand. Bought the kettle and it never whistled after two tries. It just leaked from the spout. I returned it and hope it was just a defective kettle. Am willing to try one more time since it has had other good reviews and I like the brand.
2,Good for 6 months,I really enjoyed this kettle for about six months and then the paint began to blister. The enamel on this kettle is not thick enough to keep it from peeling off of the stainless steel. I bought it for the color and functionality but now it's an eyesore on my countertop. I love the style but quality? Not up to Kitchenaid standards.
2,some what dissappointed,"The kettle is a wonderful color of red and looks well in my kitchen. However, it is very difficult to get the lid off the kettle and I really do not like to have to manually open the spout when I pour the hot water. I followed the instructions for keeping the flame down so as not to burn the sides of the pot but for some reason the bottom of the kettle shows some red through the black now. Bascially the kettle is not user friendly."
2,"pretty, but not perfect","I love the look of this kettle. and the silicone handle is a great idea, but doesn't help that steam escapes the top and burns my hand while i am pouring. and the pour spout pops closed sometimes while pouring and i end up geting scalding hot water all over the place. then i am left holding down the lever for the pour spout- wich puts my hand that much closer to the lid and the escaping steam. i use the kettle multiple times a day and have had it for a year now. if i used it less frequently i probably wouldn't be as bothered by the flaws. i'm going to keep it- but if i had it to do over agin i would have gotten something different."
2,Good looking but unsafe,"This is a great looking kettle that pours well and is comfortable to hold, however the spout cover doesn't sit tight over the spout. As a result, it doesn't whistle and I have left it boiling away unattended too many times. I've thrown it away and am looking for something else."
3,Doesn't live up to KitchenAid reputation,"Bought this after reading all of the glowing reviews, but it didn't live up to expectations.CONS:It's quite heavy, so may not be good for someone who can't lift much weight. Its whistle is very shrill, but I suppose that's a good thing, since it makes you want to turn it off immediately. Many of the reviews claimed that the handle was relatively cool after the water was boiled, but I found that not to be true. The handle gets extremely hot, much worse than the $10 supermarket kettle that it replaced. You WILL need an oven mitt or pot holder to lift this when heated.PROS:It's pretty.Would I buy another one? No! There are much better kettles which are cheaper than this."
3,Top tea pot,"I actually purchased this tea pot as a replacement. I damaged my original red kettle by placing it near a large pot of boiling water on my gas stove. The cushioned handle melted. I could still use it, but it didn't look as pretty as my new one. So, beware.... this may happen to you if you're not careful. I love the red color.....it's dark red not an orange red. One con is that it is difficult to remove the cover when adding water. I often just fill it through the spout. It's satisfactory; nothing really special. I like it because it's the perfect color and I keep it out.....more for decoration than use."
5,Pretty good tea kettle for the price,"I bought it for decoration, and it matched my other kitchenaid stuff. It looks good, boils water, and whistles! What more can you ask?"
3,More Stylish Than Practical,"I have a matching set of cookware, so I bought the tea kettle. The biggest problem is that the spout does not open very far, so it is hard to fully empty the kettle. You cannot fill it through the spout. You have to open the lid, which may be hot if you have just used the kettle, and always has condensation on the underside. Even that opening is not easy to fill, as the kettle handle is in the way. The lid does not fit properly, so that it hisses and rattles before the tea kettle actually whistles. The lever to open the spout is not as convenient as the kind that is built into the handle. I'm not ready to toss it, but it did not meet expectations."
1,junk,"have owned for approx. 3 months. whistle stopped working first then material around spout melted and would not open to pour water out.Kitchen Aid is a great brand, but this is a bad design."
1,Useless piece of junk,"The spout is not contoured which means it will pour all over the place. I can't pour anything without it getting all over the countertop. The lid of the spout will not stay up unless you have the kettle lid positioned just right. The small lid opening makes filling difficult especially with the handle positioned right over the hole. The shoddy ceramic coating cracks off and flakes at the slightest accidental impact.Buy it if you want something nice to look at in your kitchen. If you want an actual kettle for use, get something else."
3,"An ""ok"" tea kettle","It's a good tea kettle that gets the job done. Two major flaws: PRICE on Amazon - i got the same kettle from Bed Bath and Beyond for $24.99, and HANDLE - i wish the silicone would be around the whole handle as the steel tends to get warm. However, for $24.99 I think it is worth it."
2,"Two stars for attractiveness, zero stars for rustiness","I thought KitchenAid had higher standards. My cheapie IKEA tea kettle has a rounded design like this KitchenAid one but is not as cute; however, the KitchenAid tea kettle is rusty inside and the IKEA one has not rusted after several years of use (even though we keep water in it almost constantly). I cannot recommend a tea kettle that rusts."

5,great lessons,"This is the guide that i bought a couple of days ago out of i should say curiosity because the title really attracted me to the book at fist. After browsing through it i found that the methods involved actually were viable and understandable and that advertising this way won't get you in trouble for spamming. The day after I finished reading the book i started my own campaign, mostly to test the ideas... and soon it started paying off, and now it is growing"
5,great,"One of the best guides on the net on how to create a working internet e-mail campaign without compromising your company's integrity or name. The book talks about a campaign that is free of spam alerts and lawsuits from ISP's and successful, with results in a short amount of time. Great for small or big companies looking to increase their net worth"
5,Terrific 2X4 Furniture,"I built the coffee table in this book, and it turned out really nice. Some of the dimensions are off, so I recommend buying as you go. Other than that the only power tool I needed was a small sander. Great book for the beginner."
5,Great Book,"I laughed (Myrtle chapter).. I cried (Top Ten chapter).. A roller coaster of action and suspense (Disney Pro-Am Chapter).. a Thriller (Ireland Chapter- or more specifically, Irish cuisine)...Humorously captures the emotions of anyone who suddenly (and dramatically) becomes smitten with this game. Only true golf lovers need apply."
5,Brilliant,This was one of the most enjoyable books I've read all year! Very funny and full of interesting information. The guy is a hoot! I especially loved the chapter about his trip to Myrtle Beach
1,Boring,"Not a long review for me. I, unfortunately, could not get into this story and the book is left unfinished."
3,"Just like the Movies, but you better like one flavor.","No variety packs available, that's a bummer. It is a good product, my favorite flavor, but you must buy 6. I would appreciate being able to mix and match flavors in one order."
5,Very good flavor,"This is a staff favorite for popcorn and baked potatoes. It is a good, clean flavor without tasting off. I highly recommend for popcorn."
5,DELICIOUS and no MSG! I use it on tons of things,"I bought this for popcorn but have tried it on a bunch of different things. It's great, even on veggies. It seems to lose flavor when it gets heated too high, so I advise to use it after food is finished cooking and before serving as opposed to cooking with it. This product has encouraged me to try other flavors, but not sure I want a pack of 6 of anything besides Ranch since Ranch is generally so versatile. I am going to experiment with making ranch dressing with this product, just not exactly sure how yet. Probably buttermilk and whole milk equal parts to start."
4,Serving size,"Very tasty, but I needed to use much more than the recommended serving size for the popcorn to have enough flavor."
2,"doen't taste like much, especially not ranch flavor.","The flavor is lacking a ton. I don't see what all the good reviews are for unless the ones selling it are writing it. The stuff doesn't stick to the popcorn very well , even with butter added. You can empty half the contents of the ranch salt before the popcorn even barely has enough flavor."
5,Quick turn-around - Great Condition,Thanks much - I needed the books for work and had them quicker than expected.Nancy
2,"Cute read, but nothing much to gain for academics","Mandatory book for a class that failed to deliver academic quality work. While a nice enough read for airport commuters between flights, this book is rather simplistic and lacks that real impact. In short, this book talks about five dysfunctions, which are pretty well commonly understood by most managers/leaders. If it is a mandatory read or free, go for it, but there are plenty of other books out there that can provide better insight into team management like The Leadership Challenge by Kouzes and Posner."
4,"Quick, easy, and practical","I'm not a big fan of management books because they tend to get long-winded, technical, and impractical. This book is none of the three.I did not read the original book ""The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Leadership Fable"" (240 pages), but with this field guide, you don't need to read it. The field guide is 180 pages of easy reading. It's not complicated, very practical, and you don't need to be a CEO to implement the concepts.I was pleasantly surprised and would recommend this book to anyone who labors in futility on a fumbling team. It's worth your time."
4,Strong Leaders Empower Their Teams,"In 2002 Lencioni, explained the reasons for poor team performance inThe Five Dysfunctions of a Team. The five reasons were:Absence of trustFear of conflictLack of CommitmentAvoidance of accountabilityInattention to resultsThe problems described were all too common management issues and the business community craved more, specifically on how to implement the solutions. ""Overcoming the Five Dysfunctions of a Team"" was Lencioni's response. This book has essential information on how to break through the five barriers and develop high performance teams. The book is never dull: it offers much needed insights into building strong teams, fostering collaboration, and developing a winning team. After reading this book, I would suggest a nice companion read would beStop Workplace Drama: Train Your Team to Have No Excuses, No Complaints, and No Regretsby Marlene Chism."
3,Building an better team,The guide helps readers detect and correct behaviors/phenomena that threaten team cohesiveness. The book is clear and easy to use.
2,Disappointing Second Outing for Malarkey,"Her earlier novel, An Obvious Enchantment, was a gem set mostly in Zanzibar, but Resurrection is a disappointing re-hash of the literary thriller ground. Though it is set in Egypt, Malarkey's descriptions of Cairo's geography and history in the late 1940s should have been fact checked. (For example, she refers to the ""Oberai"" hotel. This hotel near the pyramids is now called the Mena House Oberoi and is part of a the Indian Oberoi chain. The Oberois didn't have anything to do with it before the 1970s or so.) My sense is that she has visited Egypt but doesn't know the country well enough to place a novel there convincingly. And finally, Wilton Barnhardt wrote an excellent, excellent book, Gospel, on this very topic about ten years ago. Read that instead."
2,predictable,"Not a bad book, and raises some points that could lead people to want to read more about the Gnostic gospels. But the love triangle was totally predictable and I know I've encountered it before in other books. The pace was pretty slow. The main female character seemed to get over her father's death with amazing rapidity. And the portrayal of the war against Israel after the Israelis declared statehood was very disturbing - she seemed to be faulting Israel for defending itself against the attack of the Arab countries (what else is new). That one thing ruined any (relatively small) enjoyment for me up to that point. In the end, just another book about Mary Magdalene. Fascinating, but this topic has been pretty much done to death at this point."
2,Simplistic Rehash,"Take some basic controversial Christian themes, mix in an exotic setting and here you have an uninspired novel. What could have been an interesting examination of women, Christianity and their place in modern society ends up feeling much more light summer reading than anything profound. Too bad, as the potential was there to say something deeper."
3,Eh...,"I personally found this book rather boring. The premise is interesting, but the character development was disappointing. I found it very hard to care about any of the characters. I did not care one bit about what happened to Gemma, and her dual flirtation was annoying. Anthony was too perfect for words, and Michael conversely flawed. The sad truth was I just didn't care. Too bad, because the potential was there."
3,A decent novel,"This is a decent novel about the gnostic gospels which were discovered in Nag Hammadi. The world of Biblical scholarship is well aware of them and well aware of the many differences between the gnostic versions and the Gospels in the New Testament. I prefer the New testament myself over the gnostic presentations. However, I digress. The novel is a decent story about the finding of these gospels and other materials.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
2,disappointing resurrection,"Having lived in Upper Egypt in the late 80s, for more than a year, I am always a sucker for novels set there. Malarkey's book was big on the 'sucker' rating. Kind of a Zane Grey action romance, but low on action and romance. Some of the characters were starting out interesting but with no real depth revealed. Then there was the tourist description of Cairo and the Nile...The caricature of Christianity she kicks at seems to encompass all other expressions within her highly critical view of the Catholic Church hierarchy (a la Dan Brown). Did all these people go to bad Catholic high schools, or something? When I read the obvious historical error (p354), that Constantine [post 300AD] (after aligning himself with Christianity) wiped out the Jews in Palestine, I realized she really is mixed up on a lot of stuff. Jerusalem was destroyed in 70AD and the last Jewish-Roman war (Bar-Kokhba) was 135AD in Hadrian's reign.but good, mindless, summer reading..."
4,Thought Provoking,"Resurrection is to be savored.Malarkey's writing is crisp, poetic and descriptive.Her characters develop and mature while their intelligence grows.I was totally fascinated with this look into the discovery of the gnostic gospels and learned a great deal, not only of history but of religion.Although Catholic, I am now interested in learning more. When I finished Resurrection, I ran out to buy Elaine Pagels' book, The Gnostic Gospels, from which Tucker Malarkey draws.Only one complaint: the language is so lyrical to be vague at times.I am anxious to read her first novel, An Obvious Enchantment."
4,Tucker Malarkey takes you on a great ride,"This book takes you on a great ride through Egypt, Religious history and a griping story of intrigue and relationships. Her sense of place is marvelous. The complicated story of the gospels unfolds in a clear and meaningful way. It gave me hope for women in religion and religion's future."
4,Better Research than 'Da Vinci Code',"While I enjoyed 'Da V,' I kept being struck by the giant leaps in common sense I was expected to make to find the story half way believable. (It has been my experience, in my very long life, that no large organization -- be it a government, religion organization, a fraternal organization -- can accomplish even a surprise birthday party for children, let alone a secret mission. Remember Irangate?) I also was underwhelmed by the poor scholarship. Malarkey, OTOH, used far more respected sources (eg, Elaine Pagels) to tell her tale, and while is dragged in some places, I found the story engrossing and, yes, even inspirational. Well worth reading."
2,Slow.,"I picked this up after having it recommended as a sort of thinking person's Da Vinci Code.It does a couple of Da Vinci Code angles: Roman Catholic Church hatred of women, RC Church willingness to kill to maintain its position. Other than that, while the Da Vinci Code was a genuine page-turner, this book required a bit of commitment to finish, and at the end I didn't want to read it again.One ""no good deed goes unpunished"" bit I enjoyed was Gemma's work which leads to a perfectly ironic death. Nice touch.Other than that, well, it was a bit of a disappointment. If this is the thinking person's Da Vinci Code, I'll stick with the original, and the mindless escapism."
1,A major disappointment!,"If I had not been trapped on an airplane with no other alternative, I would never have finished this book. It is a very cheap play on Dan Brown's theme, with a thin love story line and weak plot. Do not waste your money."
2,Real Cheep!,"The quality of this jacket is real cheep. The lining tore after one time wearing it. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one, is because I what do you expect for 10 bucks."
5,Superb!,"From the moment the author approached me to read the draft of Until Soon, I considered it one of the best conceptions of original lesbian fiction I had read. A genre that has been clouded with tired cliques and predictable storylines; Maya Indigal has achieved originality with her work. The characters come to life in this well written novel. Andi and CJ are bright stars in this tale about love and the journey and courage it takes to open ones heart. Until Soon sits on my shelf well read and much loved."
4,Satisfying First Novel,"Sweet parts, angsty parts, slightly steamy parts... this novel has it all.A couple of intriguing main characters with a solid supporting cast against a pleasing backdrop of a small New England college town. Nicely paced: the main characters' relationship and the entire story moves forward without feeling rushed and without glaring plot gaps.Where some of the more prolific authors have become almost formulaic in their output, Maya's contribution is an invigorating change of pace.A more than worthwhile way to spend a lazy weekend."
4,easy read,Good friends Pam and Dan are out enjoying a play date in the park. Pam is wearing a great red hat. All of a sudden the wind picks up and blows Pam's hat away. Follow Dan and Pam as they try to catch the hat!The book is part of the green light readers series. Young children will feel a since of pride when completing the book. There are very few words per page and the story moves at a fast pace.The book is great for readers who are learning to read on their own. The story ends but not the book. It has a craft idea and discussion questions to ask after reading.
4,One of the Better McCoy Stories,"Remembrance of the Daleks is actually one of the better McCoy stories.I like the sentimental touch with the Doctor's return to Totter's Lane, the Hand of Omega, and the introduction of the Special Weapons Dalek.Its not as dark or surreal as some of the McCoy stories which is why I like it."
2,OVERRATED!!!,"It's funny how certain people have a problem with the violent and ""uncompassionate"" nature of Colin Baker's Doctor, but are totally at ease with McCoy's manipulative, uncaring side. They changed the entire background of the Doctor during this era, going from a mere timelord who absconded with a TARDIS from Gallifrey to a near God-like figure. I can't understand how this is acceptable in the minds of some people. Why is it that they have a problem with the 6th Doctor shooting Cyberman and asphyxiating a sadistic killer like Shockeye but are ok with McCoy's manipulating Davros into destroying his own Daleks? I don't get that one. All this said, at least Remembrance of the Daleks is better than the Crappiness Patrol."
1,"sadly, not well done at all","First I'd like to say I've always been a fan of Doctor Who and have watched many episodes. I hadn't seen much of the Sylvester McCoy seasons, though, and was very disappointed with this episode. Doctor who has always had cheesy special effects and a low budget (which is part of its charm), but the plots are usually fairly well thought out. In this case, the basic plot idea is interesting, but the writing and execution is terrible! The dialog is childish and the characters completely one-dimensional. Compared to the original Daleks episode from the 60's, it is obvious that the show went downhill in its final seasons."
2,Two Stars ONLY because it is a great story,"As I stated in a comment on an earlier review, since I do not pick cash off a tree in my back yard, I cannot buy sets over and over again because 'mistakes' have been corrected. If the BBC wants to refund the purchase price of the 'flawed' sets or exchange the new sets for them, that would be great. Why should fans have to 'double-dip' in our own pockets for production mistakes?If you do NOT already own this release, by all means, but the 'corrected' version, because the story is excellent. I cannot condone RE=PURCHASE, however. If the BBC were really smart, they would purposely 'flaw' every set and then make double their profits by 'correcting' them every 3-4 years and re-selling them!"
1,Did the other reviewers see the same movie that I did?,Am I the only person who thought that this episode was terrible? Maybe the other reviewers were watching another movie. At least Ace looked good.There were just so many things not to like about this wasted Dalek story. I can see why the BBC retired the series now. Here's a one word summation: stale.
4,Maybe the best Sylvester McCoy adventure,"...""best"", but just 4 stars??? Well this is just a shadow what Doctor Who was till the mid-70's. Scripts and some of the producer's decisions managed to push the series quality down to the death-point in 1989.Nevertheless the 7th Doctor is an original of his own... enjoyable at least in a view stories!"
2,Some things are better left to memory,"I purchased this because it was the last appearance of the Daleks and I wanted to let my son see what the big fuss was all about. I forgot how tedious some of the Dr. Who episodes are! My son couldn't sit through the entire thing, but I manged to slog through it. All I kept thinking was that Sylvester McCoy really could have used a good cleaning for his teeth, especially with all of the close-ups he was given. The story was not very exciting, but the commentaries included in the DVD edition were quite interesting. This is for real Dr. Who fans only."
4,Vibes are flowing with this great IV album,"IV always is great for me. They may borrow a bit lyric-wise from Bob but they are always irie and always make me smile. These guys have been making records since they met in a polio rehab and had first success with Same Song which is also a must have. They are really great though and their vibes are always positive and their music is mellow and they have interestingly haunting voices. While some of their lyrics are reminisant of Bob, they bring an originality that is new and fresh, and a sound that is different than other Jamaican groups. I enjoy this album a lot."
2,Not that Good,80's synth reggae people. There are only two albums worth buying by IV.Same Song and Unconquered PeopleSave your money and don't allow yourselves to be convinced that this music is the real roots. Peace!
1,Kindle Version,I am a big fan of Doonesbury and I was happy to see that there are Kindle versions of his books.Unfortunately Once I downloaded this book the strips were so small they were unreadable. Guess I will stick to the paper versions for now on.
2,"Short, very short, snippets on Civil War","This book is a compilation of research about strange facts concerning people, places and things during the Civil War. There is no depth or organization to the short articles. Reminds me of a ""Ripley's Believe It or Not"" middle school fun fact book. I grew tired of trying to read the eclectic collection of stories."
5,Great Wall Mount,"I bought this wall mount to go with my cheap 30"" Phillips plasma screen. I wanted a wall mount that would permit the screen to be pivoted left/right, up/down, and with some ability to move the screen away from the wall.The mount has heavy-duty construction, and seems well built. The box includes the necessary bolts, washers, nuts, and cable ties to install the unit. The instructions are fairly clear, although it did take some study to figure out how to put everything together properly.What I like best about this mount is that it requires very little effort to swivel or pivot the television (even my 2-1/2 year old can do so), but that once its position has changed, it holds the new position. There is no sagging or rotation due to gravity -- once I change the position (using just a finger to push the device), it smoothly translates to the new position, then stays there.I would definitely buy this mount again, and would recommend Sanus as a quality product."
1,Hatchet job,"A pure hatchet job by a true Hemingway hater. Gives the worst possible interpretation of everything Papa did, said, or even thought. This guy's got a problem. This is malice, not objective history. Sorry I wasted my money."
4,A Great Read,"This book was very entertaining. I think it gives a good sense of the whole coming-out process and the immense challenges gay people face when they truly realize that they are gay and living in a straight society. Even if you are not gay, the book is funny and the main character is very likeable (and totally clueless). It is also quite a touching story of first love and the first time you meet someone who makes you feel like the most beautiful person in the world."
4,Great price for quality,"I bought this after doing some research on flash players. I am thus far extremely happy with my choice. I have already accidentally dropped the player a few times,and so far have incurred no noticeable damage. The player works perfectly when running for long periods of time. I thought the interface was very easy to get used to, after a once-through on the user manual. Go Samsung!"
4,Solid product,It's probably one of the best for the size of the player. You normally can get around 6 cd's worth of music on it and the rechargeable battery is a major benifit. The ear buds aren't very good but for free who cares.
4,Satisfied,I've been using the player for a month now. The quality of the sound is very good. The screen resoltion and coloring is not so imressive as i thought. In general i satisfied woth this purchase.
3,A decent portable music player,"Positives:1.The sound is great.2.It's really small.3.It is easy to transfer music to and from the device.4.Color screen is amusing.Negatives:1.Unit controls are lacking. Navigation through the unit's features and songs is tedious.2.Short battery life.3.Screen is too small.4.Bundled software is not very useful.Additional notes:The samsung yp-t7x is easily the best portable music player I've ever owned. However, the only other portable music players I've used were CD players, cassette walkmans, and a minidisc player.I don't know how it stacks up against other MP3 players."
1,This is a discrase to the MS Team,"If I was not so into wanting the whole 08th MS Team collection I probably would have never bought this. It has nothing new except for Miller. Personally I would not even call this a movie. It is just a bunch of clips from the series. There is only about 10 min. of new footage on the dvd. If you have the whole series already and are trying to decide weather or not to get this just think to yourself; is it worth [the money], and could I think up a better story then the one given."
3,The 08th MS review,I found this some what entertaining but for the most part I was bored. All it basically has is talking and bareley any fighting. They characters voices sounded horrible for some odd reason. Although it had its downs I was entertained with the storyline. If you want a 08th MS team dvd I would recomend volume four and I would just rent millers report.
2,Just a lot of repeat video!,"Well, I would say I'm a huge fan of Gundam, but this movie is a disappointment. The regular series is awesome, but this movie is just a couple of episodes edited with the character of Miller put into them. Not worth it all. Unless you're just collecting everything Gundam. Anything else just skip this one. Nothing is really added to the story, and I say you've already seen about 90% of this movie any way. Only 10% or less is even new! It's just not worth it. Much better ways to spend your money than this."
4,Longer 8th Episode,"Most of the time I give non-Wing Gundam 5 stars, but this gets only 4 because it is basically an expanded episode 8. CTN played an edited version of this in place of the real 8th episode. Get it if you want it, but it doesn't really add anything new to 8th Team except for the investigator, Miller. She was seduced by a Zeon spy and is convinced that Shiro Amada is in the same boat."
1,A sad book riddled with errors,"I don't usually review books, but I felt compelled to warn people about this disaster of a book. Midnight Tiger contains information on a large amount of games. The problem with this information is that it doesn't contain any substance and is full of misinformation.It's obvious that the author of this book did little or no research and based his content on hearsay rather than factual information. Buy at your own risk."
5,Beautiful and High Quality!,This set is truly beautiful. It also holds up very well in the wash. The design is gorgeous and the material is high quality. It is well worth the money!
5,puppy plane is adorable!,"After spending to much time looking for a cute nursery bedding set that included a puppy theme, I decided to order Puppy Plane. Puppy Plane was the first one I found and I really liked it but I wanted to see my other options, which were very very few. The reviews I had read about Puppy Plane were so helpful, especially one from ""Dobie MoM"". I am also a dobie mom and a rottie mom and agree that this pattern is just darling. There are so many great colors in the pattern that can't really be seen from the small pictures. I am having a baby boy and wanted to stay away from blue just because its such an obvious choice for boys, but Puppy Plane allows you to use yellow, green, red, almost any color for accents. The quality looks great and we are so happy with our choice. This set is perfect!"
4,Loved it!,"Just goes to show you don't need big stars to make a great film. Kevin Howarth is amazing and Luke Goss shows he has some real acting chops. The plot does twist and turn but stick with it - it is worth it. Begs for a sequel but as it never made it to the bid screen, I guess that won't happen. Real shame. I want more."
4,"very good ""B"" movie","after a seemingly fatal accident, a dedicated cop gain unnatural abilities that he and his partner use for their own savage kind of vigilante justice. the body count grows as the transformation continues, and one cop must choose between loyalty and morality."
4,Interesting Movie,"I read some of the reviews before buying this movie and I am glad I did , I just did not agree with most of the reviews I did see what some of the viewers where talking about (lighting, dialogue,etc)but over all it was a fair movie. Again Luke Goss pretty much carried the whole thing for me I thought the story line very original (even believable to an extent) by no means is this the best movie of this type that I have seen but it still was interesting if you have nothing else to do on a Friday night. I recommend renting it unless like me you collect every movie featuring Luke Goss good bad or ugly!"
5,"Excellent book - history, where to eat, what to see, tips","We just got back from Santa Fe. This book was wonderful! It has history, what to see (museums, ruins, architecture), where to eat (an interesting list -- we didn't particularly use it because we had personal referrals). It had great tips -- like buy the 5-museum pass for slightly more than a one-museum, one-day pass. I was very pleased I'd read it BEFORE I went and it was very useful while we were there."
5,Excellent Guide for First-Time Visitors,"I am going to visit Santa Fe for a few days and to do a job interview there. I wanted a book that would give me all the information I needed about Santa Fe and the surroundings so that I could come up with a list of places I wanted to visit, restaurants I wanted to eat at, and so on. I definitely recommend this book for those who want to be able to have a clear picture of where they want to go once they reach Santa Fe!"
3,Greate Read!,"I did like this book after a while, however, it did take me a while to get into it. I feel that a lot of her books have the same plot to them but in different situations. I tend to like her later books in the serious as to opposed the earler ones, but over all it was a good book. =)"
3,Good..but not the best of her work!,"This one is an essential read...as it sets up some of the history....and KUDOS to her for coming up with the Atlantis twist....I love it!But after reading about 4 of her books I realized that some of the other books have a much more ""nail biting"" plot."
3,It's just ok,"Love Bites was my first Lynsay Sands book, and to be honest, I'm not sure I will buy another one. Love Bites was a light read, and the heroine was likeable, but the hero was a tad annoying. He was too geeky for my taste, and he took way too long to make any kind of move on Rachel, and once he did, there wasn't a whole lot of sexual tension. I did find Pudge, the guy trying to kill Etienne, amusing. He was crazy, but his misconceptions about vampires was pretty funny. The secondary character Thomas ANNOYED me. Who says ""dudette""? Every time he said it I cringed! Since others said they liked SWV better, I may try that one, but I won't be rushing out to get it or anything."
3,Disappointing,"I am very disappointed that this book did not follow Single White Vampire. It seems that Lucerne is not married in Love Bites so it must be a prequel to SWV, but how can that be when Etienne is also single in SWV. I assume Sands has no intention of making these books reflect the passage of time and will make all the brothers still single when Bastien finds his mate. It works much better when the characters continue their lives as the books develop and much more enjoyable to read how things are going. This book is not nearly as funny as SWV and the story is not as interesting nor is the love between the two as captivating. If the next book in this series has not yet been written, there might still be time to pull the lives of these brothers all together. Here's hoping."
5,Wonderful read,This was a really great book. This is the best of the 3 in the series. I highly reccommend it.
2,could have been better,"This book did have a very interesting premise, but it could have been written in a whole much better direction than just to have the two main characters repeatedly having sex throughout most of the book. I did like the fact that 'respectable' vampires drink from bags of donated blood instead of attack people on the street (could have made a good subplot dealing with the blood bags); and the straws getting stuck on the woman's fangs so that she didnt have to taste the blood was kind of inventive too (but then she could have moved on with her life and tried to eke out what she could of the life she had before becoming a vampire). Too bad the blood issues were the only interesting things in the book."
2,Lame,"Bought it at a grocery store in South Dakota while on vacation for a quick summer read, should have left it there. So many cliches and bad romance lines and vocabulary that it was a waste of time. Nothing worth while, read anything Patti Briggs for a real storyline that doesn't make you feel dumber for having read it."
3,More of the Same,"I enjoyed the novelty plot of the first book in this series and ordered the others based on that fact. By the third book the story line was becoming predictable ... vampire meets and falls in love with human, turns them into vampire and then must explain origins and benifits of immortal's (vampire) life. Our hero must then survive the attack of a mortal who wishes to destroy all vampires. Be aware there are multiple graphic four page sex scenes. I'm not against an occassional sex scene, but these seem to take the place of meaningful conversations or character development. The male characters all have the same personalities; the author just substituted names, dark hair for blonde and change their jobs."
4,A funny twist on being immortal!,Since has a unique twist on what happens when you can only be killed in a specific way and yet look dead otherwise. As Etienne keeps finding himself in the morgue it is bound to become comical. The story over all is nice but for the most part a sweet romantic fluff piece.
4,Love Bites!,I have enjoyed all of the Linsay Sands Argeneau Novels. I started towards the end and have had to work my back through the series. They are light and funny and make for easy reading. I can't find them on the shelf any longer so I have been down loading them to my Kindle. This was one of my favorite stories so far!
4,"sexy, funny, paranormal romance","Vampire sex comedy featuring erotically romantic romps. Original take on the origin of the vampire species, with nice family closeness among the vampire clan. This is the beginning of a long, well-loved paranormal series featuring the fangtastic Argeneau clan. Lynsay Sands writes with a welcome humorous bite!"
2,"Long-winded, obvious advice","Brian Tracy (the author) is like your know-it-all relative who likes to pontificate at family functions. Most of what Tracy says is some combination of boring, obvious, and predictable. Also, he's fond of citing dubious statistics at every turn (example: ""Only 2% of people can work effectively without supervision"". Really, Brian? Where did you get that factoid?). ""Eat that Frog!"" does contain some valid advice -- but don't expect anything surprising, insightful, or new. If you just need a kick in the pants to get going, you may find this book useful. If you're looking for something beyond run-of-the-mill advice, look elsewhere."
2,Repetitive,"I'm listening to the audio version of this book, and an hour in, the author had told me many, many times to prioritize and eliminate the least important tasks on my list. Each time he says that, a thought pops up ""This book is the least important thing I've done all day..."" Finally, I can no longer ignore it. Sorry, Mr. Tracy, you've talked me out of listening to the rest of your book. It's all basic time management stuff, anyway."
3,Not what I thought,I liked all the great reviews and even now I am thinking that I missed something in this book that others got out of it. But really guys...is it me or is every chapter talking about the same thing. In fact there are a few pages that every chapter starts about the same thing just reworded a little. Its like a really good chapter was made and all the rest were reworded versions of that one great chapter. I wouldn't buy this again. I did get some useful stuff out of it but take a look at it in a book store before you buy it. The author has like 20 or so audio books and stuff in the back section. The topics even seem to over lap with each one. Its like buying Turbo Tax. Why did they make so many versions of the same thing? Over marketing? One heck of a great chapter but this short book would have been even better if they kept it 20 pages or so.
4,Eat That Frog,"For a quick, snap-shot overview of goal setting techniques and concepts, ""Eat That Frog"" fits the bill very effectively. It's a fast read (or listen to, if you buy the audio CD) and very enjoyably written. If you want a more in-depth, step-by-step process of planning and attaining your goals through goal setting, I would recommend Brian Tracy's book or audio CDs entitled <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/r.html?R=BVUTKS8JH7XW&C=2MZE3AWOMYAIJ&T=C&U=/o/ASIN/157270358X/ref=cm%5Frev%5Femailcr%5Fp1%5Fc1154450%5Fdp%5F1%5Fh&H=1Zlcex8RQN2JZU84JtmA4TJzoecA"">""Goals!: How to Get Everything You Want-Faster Than You Ever Thought Possible""</a>. ""Eat That Frog"" as a companion book can then serve as a periodic ""refresher"" of his most valuable concepts."
5,Eat that frog!,I am now working on the most difficult and ugly tasks in my life first. This book encourages us to do that and it makes perfect sense. Get the worse out of the way and the rest is easy!
4,Good read,The book was common sense mostly but it made you take a look at how you procrastinate and not realize it. Follow the 21 principals and I believe it will help.
3,"Easy read, but nothing new","There's nothing new or noteworthy in this book, if you've read any self help or time emangement books at all, you've seen all this before. The style is breezy so it's an easy read without a lot of psycho-babble. My beef, and the reason I gave it 3 stars, is that it is focused almost entirely on work-how to impress your boss, take more courses to improve you job performance etc. The first suggestion in the book is to ""sit down with your boss"" to set goals. The author assumes that most people work, and they work in traditional offices. I'm really tired of books that give advice like ""listen to audiobooks on your drive to work."". The title of the book should include the words "" at Work."" it doesn't relate for people who don't work outside the home, or have non traditional jobs."
5,Just highlight the whole book!,"This is the most encouraging book I've ever read, like the title of my review says, you may just as well highlight the whole book. Not a single sentence is wasted: it is either good advice or builds up to good advice.The book is short, so you can read it several times, digest it, and make it your life's philosophy."
2,Not as stated,"The book's cover was in good shape, but there was writing and underlining in pen through about 15+ pages. This would have easily been seen by the merchant. I am dissapointed that this was not represented in the description. Will be leary of buying from this merchant in the future."
4,21 Little Gems,"A summary of simple and easy steps to boost your productivity in a slim, easily read book that's suitable for even the most time pressured of people. With plenty of tips and ideas that you can dip in and out of when you need it, to help deal with the habit of putting things off. It's on my recommended reading list for clients and is a great addition to any busy person's bookshelf.You can't even make the excuse that you don't have time to read it, each chapter is only a few pages long with a handy summary/action section after each one."
2,hard to swallow,"I wanted very much to like this book.Normally I will read an excellent book cover to cover only taking time off to eat, sleep, and go to work.A good book I will typically read a chapter a day, every day.Although this book has some decent advice, it is a very dry read.I have had for over a month now and am only a third through it."
3,Simple!,"Good quick read!In essence, this is yet another book to stop procastinating and start doing.I like the style in which it is narrated, interesting.There is nothing very new I found that I did not find in other similar books. What I however liked is the tittle and relating some content to the title.A quick read. Borrow this book if you can. I would not recommend a buy!"
1,"Not one new idea, not one orginal thought","Oh, man! What a waste of money this was.It is a 2 paragraph thought sold for 20 bucks. And those 2 paragraphs do not contain one new idea. If you have ever read any book on setting goals or time management, save your money on this one.The essence of the book is:Identify your long term goal.List all your tasks and align them to the long term goal.Do the ones that are required to achieve that long term goal urgently and ignore the ones that do not help you reach that goal.If you really need to read every word, get it from the library and save yourself some money."
5,Eat That Frog,"Simple in it's structure and approach, PHENOMENAL in it's application. My wife recommended this to me and bought me a copy. It took me a couple of months to get around to reading it. Procrastination, need I say more.Since reading it the first time I have purposed to read it again each month for a year, one chapter a day most days. I have done this now 7 times and it's a great daily reminder of good principles of managing my time purposefully. I have bought a copy for each of our 3 children and have included in in the 'Must Read' list in our corporate library.Don't miss this little Gem."
2,Obtaining this book is something you can likely procrastinate on...,"The book could've been much shorter as it repeated the same points over and over and over. This review feels the same way in that it's just a repeat of what others have said. Sorry about that... Tried to like the book and look for some positive qualities. I guess it could serve as a reminder of goal setting and prioritizing. But, I felt like it was mainly a rehashing of parts of Covey's 7 Habits of Highly Effective People and I think Covey said it better himself. I would advise checking your public library first if you're interested in the book, just so as to avoid possibly spending money you will regret."
4,Excellent concepts,The Eat That Frog is an excellent way to eliminate a fear of doing something or just completing a project that is bugging you that you just don't seem to get done. I have already used some of the practices that are suggested in the book and have been quite successful. A quick read with a lot of benefits.
4,Organization?,I love this Audio tape. I listened to this all the way to and back on a trip on my car CD player. I really like his views on cleaning up your messes.
5,Excellent Book,"Eat That Frog is an excellent anti-procrastination book. Much of procrastination comes from doing a dreaded task, even if that task is important to you or others. Using this metaphor, the author breaks down these issues and encourages you to do that which you have been putting off. I now refer to my most important project of the day as 'eating my frog'.Regarding the reviewers who have stated that information later in the book is contrary to the author's overall view, I disagree. You can use more than one method when it comes to achieving your goals. Just because you are working on your most important project doesn't mean that you can't break it down in to manageable parts, or set aside a specific time to work on it, or use other techniques to accomplish what you need to do."
1,This was a worthless book,"I bought this (audio) book because it had such great reviews. I however found it to have nothing of value. I was disappointed that I wasted my money that I could have spend on another audio book.Just so you know the types of books I like, my thre all time favorite audio books are...Choose to be Rich (Robert Kiyosaki)The E-Myth Revisited (Michael Gerber)The 4 Hour Work Week (Timothy Ferriss)"
2,No kidding?,"Brian Tracy really has developed himself into a formula. This book...though completely correct in its assersions...reads like one long fortune cookie. If he of decided to name the book 31 great ways, you get the feeling he would have just made up ten more.It contains substance...but not necessarily wisdom."
2,Eat That Frog,Good book....but almost too detailed. The overall concept of facing the big tasks first comes through...but I think he could have told the reader in half the pages.
3,Eat That Frog! by Brian Tracy,"Read for a workshop. Didn't particularly find any new ideas, but they were certainly presented in a memorable way."
1,Nothing but Common Sense,"I was unfortunately forced to read ""Eat that Frog"" in one of my classes. Everything that Tracy covers in the book is common sense. Waste of my time, money, and most importantly it shouldn't have been on my list of frogs to eat."
2,Superficial Self-Help,"Tracy points out the obvious in this book. There is no real insight, or paradigm shifting solution offered here. Perhaps for some, who have never tried to overcome their procrastination paralysis, this book would be mildly helpful... but I doubt it."
2,Author not trustworthy,The authors personal story is full of inconsistencies. It is difficult to read the book beyond statements that are either lies or errors.
3,I ate a frog,"This was informative. It gets boring listening if they don't read with emotion. Don't tell me how succesful you are. I know you must have some good credentials, or you wouldn't get published. Every bit of help I can get to be succesful myself, I will learn from it."
4,RB's review of Eat That Frog,"I have always respected Brian Tracy. I had the pleasure to hear him speak at a national sales meeting. He is a great motivator.RPB Crestline, Ca."
4,A great book,I am really glad I bought this book. I am a Marine that has a lot of different responsibilities. It is short and to the point. I gave it a four because of grammatical errors throughout the book. The message is still clear!
2,Boring,"The book shows 21 different WAYS to tackle procrastination; you just choose which one works for you. For some reason, the book bored me to sleep. First, is the wording and secondly, the 21 different strategies are almost too similar. The words that he uses are toooo boring, words that can be used in a lecture or seminar, not a book. I wished someone had read me the book instead!"
4,Great Book Great ebook,"My first ebook purchased for time management. Great book, the delivery was great I guess thats why they called ebook."
5,The best about time management a success,"It is the best book i have ever read and listen about time management and self improvement, because every advise is practical and very helpful. I think one can better the productivity a lot using these knowledge."
5,FANTASTIC!!,"This book is fantastic reading. concise, to the point, a true handbook for the procrastinator!!! I handed it to all my business associates and they love it! Great guidelines to achieve success in business, and in life! Eat That Frog has to be the best book I've read in a long time to teach me how step by step to write goals and schedules,and keep me on track with them to build my business. Thanks, Brian!!!"
2,The frog you get is warmed over Tracy leftovers,"If you own nothing else written by Brian Tracy then you may get something out of this offering - hence the two stars. Otherwise, spend your money elsewhere. I can't think of one new thing I learned after listening to this tape program. Normally I am a big fan of Brian Tracy, but this time I think he rehashed and repackaged old material, and he did not even select his best. Very disappointed."
4,great one!,"Having just readPersonal Best - How Ordinary People Achieve Extraordinary Success and How You Can Too,I was keen to read this book to keep the momentum going . I have read many books on personal finance and wealth building, but this one by Brian Tracy is really good. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Read the book, constantly refer to it, or listen to the Cd's. This is truly a resource to be used ov. I highly recommend this book."
3,Eat That Frog,"Nice little book that puts a creative and cute spin on time management. Downside is that there isn't anything original, but it is creative."
4,"Tracy takes info. from several sources and simplifies into short, easy read","In this book, Brian Tracy takes valuable time management skills from several well-known sources and condenses into a short and easy read. Tasks are easy to work through, and if you follow the plan, you can get yourself on the road to organization and more stream-lined productivity in no time. This was so easy to follow that my whole family is now working through the book together, and it's making a big difference for all of us. Identifying what's most important, setting goals, etc. takes time, so don't get discouraged -- stick to it! This is an easy and fun way to better time management! Thanks Brian!"
3,Eat That Frog with free DVD,"I like this book, and it has good message. What I don't like is the ""Free DVD"", well, it is free and I shouldn't expect too much, but a DVD with only 1 minutes and 28 seconds video clip is just misleading for spending extra $ for it. I can just go for a book and save me a couple dollars. People can also view the same video clip online anyway."
2,Useless for real procrastinators,"At the start of this book Tracy says that he will not go into the psychological or emotional aspects of procrastination, yet that is exactly what procrastinators need. If you don't know why you do things, how can you change? I know all about goal setting, prioritizing tasks, doing the most difficult task first -- that's not the problem. I know what to do, but still can't get over the mental block. This book says, Just Do It, and you'll feel better, and want to do more! This is useless advice. If I could just do it, I wouldn't need a book.Unless you're completely in the dark about goal setting and time management, avoid this book."
4,Good book for the procrastinator,"""Eat That Frog"" by Brian Tracy is an excellent book about creating habits to stop procrastination. This easy to read book gives 21 pieces of advice to stop putting off the things that really need to be done and just do them.I found a lot of these examples repeated from his book, ""Million Dollar Habits"" but repeatition is sometimes needed to learn some techniques. Additionally the layout in this book is much better so I highly recommend this book also.The mostly focuses on the importance of setting goals, planning and attacking the big tasks from a piece by piece mindset. While I found this advice relevent and helpful, I would have liked some examples, especially in the planning part of the book. However there are plenty of other books out there on that topic and examples were probably left out to keep the size of the book small and easy to reread.In all, definitely a great book and worth reading. I give it 4 out of 5 stars."
2,Eat that Frog,Very disappointed in the non-ability to hear the audio version I purchased. Tried it in two vehicles and the same result. Volume turned up all the way was difficult to hear while traveling. I now will have to schedule it when I have total quiet time outside of driving. Hard to understand why this was done.
3,One Stop Shopping,Not a lot new here. In fact the author even admits that this is a book about books. A good one stop place to get advice on procrastination. Advice on how not to that is. Although he will admit there is a time to procrastinate and it can be a tool. That I have found to be true. If looking for some new insite this is not the book. If looking for many old ideas from many people this is your book.
2,Reads like crib notes from too many motivational speakers,"While this book does have some interesting ideas, none of them is very well developed. If you feel like you need to be more productive, this book will only make you feel guilty, with suggestions like ""if this isn't the most important thing in your life, why are you wasting your time on it?"" The author says in the introduction that he got where he is in life by asking successful people about their productivity habits, then emulating them, and this comes through in the book: it reads like a collection of his notes from those conversations. If you've never read a productivity book before, this might be an interesting whirl-wind introduction, but really, why waste your time on it?"
3,Eat Another Frog,"Twenty-one principles that the author says he discovered. No real strategy. Even the conclusion, To Put It All Together, just repeats the 21 ideas seperatly."
5,The best book on the subject,"I read a book called 'Procrastination: Why You Do It, What To Do About It' That book was worthless and didn't help me at all. I read Tracy's book and was in total control of my life immediately. This is no joke. It really did do everything for me that I had hoped. To be completely honest: I was about half-way through reading 'The Success Principles' when I read this book. So, that book had actually helped me, too. I was on my way back from dropping off my motorcycle at the shop for maintenance. I took the bus downtown, ate at Subway, and was done reading the book by the time I got home about four hours later. It is so amazing. The solutions to overcoming procrastination are so simple it will amaze you. I suggest you get 'The Success Principles' by Jack Canfield as well. It doesn't matter where you are in life. If you haven't read it, you need to."
2,Dissapointed,I was so excited about ordering this book. I love Family Fun's monthly magazine and other books published by them but this I could have taken a pass on. The recipes are different but they arent simple and easy. In fact they are creative meals that take some time to prepare and time at the grocer to purchase the items.
3,Nothing that you could not have found off the website,"I am an avid cookbook collector,espically kids. I was very exicited to order this book. However, when I first recieved it, my first thought was""is that all"" Its tiny. And the recipies are well written, easy to make, and includes basic stapes for every family, still nothing that you couldnt get off the family fun website. The Disney version is better. The downfall, is that it is not sprial bound. But for the price is was just ""Okay."""
5,"Not only did the kids love it, my husband did too!","I just bought this cookbook last week, and the day I got it, I got to use it in one of those last minute meal situations! We had some extreme storm damage and I didn't have time to get to the store and go grocery shopping, and I looked through the book and discovered I had all the ingredients on hand for the Creamy Corn Chowder, which I made and my family loved! My family is the type that tells me to make whatever I want for dinner then complain about it, so I was pretty surprised! My four year old daughter and I went through the whole cookbook again this morning and managed to make a whole meal plan of easy sounding recipes most of which I happened to have the ingredients in my pantry! Best of all, she can help me cook, which is something she really loves to do! I also have the snack cookbook, but I haven't used it yet! Now we have to make the raspberry pops so they are ready for dessert tonight!"
2,The Fokker Dr 1. & D VII In WW1,"I found this book to be a good basic reference . However , It could use more in the way of text dealing with the way these planes were painted during the conflict and accurate color plates would go a long way toward helping . That said , The period photo's are excellent ! Some really good pictures of the Triplanes ."
3,Good for the price,"I found the quality very poor - although I am a bit surprised as its Nine west. Well, The shoe is very cute looking"
4,"Good shoe, good price","Good basic black pump. It took a couple wears to break in the shoe, but since has been fairly comfortable."
3,Love the print but not so much for the pointy design,"The shipment was faster than I expected, even with labor day long holiday. I couldn't wait to try them on when I received the parcel yesterday. I love the print of the shoes but not so much about the too pointy shape. My boyfriend said the shoes gave me ""a witch look"". Personally, I think these shoes won't go well with pants as they are too pointy. Also, the shoes were designed to be narrow side, I think it runs a bit smaller than the actual size. I think I will keep them anyway, as an alternative for my wardrobe choice."
3,heel wore down,"These shoes were great and comfortable - very sharp looking, and the heel height is perfect if you're looking for a little height but don't want to deal with stilettos.Unfortunately, I have to echo what a previous reviewer said, and say that the plastic heel tip wore down very quickly - to the point where you could see the metal."
2,"Attractive basic pump, but don't expect it to last for long","I bought these pumps in November for wear with pantsuits, slacks, and dresses. I don't like extremely high heels because I am tall and also because I like to walk quickly (I find very high heels to be a hinderance). I got them in black. They weren't too exciting but functional. Or so I thought... I didn't wear them THAT many times - maybe twice a month maximum. I have 5 pairs of black heels counting this pair. Notwithstanding this relatively infrequent wear, the plastic cap on the heel wore completely through to the metal by June (yes - within 7 months of relatively infrequent wear). I wasn't pleased. Normally I have a good experience with Nine West shoes, so I was surprised. I wonder if one of my shoes was defective."
3,"Great shoe, too bad I got the wrong size and color","I love this shoe. I have it in a couple other colors. However, after receiving the box from Amazon.com...I was disappointed to have received the wrong color and size. The box indicated the right size and color shoe, but someone must have switched before shipping. I would have returned, but after checking online, there werent any of the red snake shoes in my size available. Fortunately, they fit a friend and I gave them to her. I was really bummed."
5,Best pumps I ever owned!,"OMG...the reviews I read were not hype! These are the best pumps you will ever purchase and they are worth the money! Take the advice and buy a half size smaller because they will stretch. I absolutely love mine and can foresee owning many more pairs...regardless of the cost! They look great with skirts, dresses, jeans, capris and anything else. You can wear them all day and walk around in them. The only downside I can see is the heel cap comes off easily but watch it...I put a daub of Superglue on mine when it started to come loose and it's all good. But if it comes loose again, I'll take it to my Shoe Repair place and get it fixed right. These shoes are KEEPERS!!!"
3,Sleek but not so comfortable,They look pretty good but they are not the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. They got to me super fast. A little more narrow than I expected. Probably wouldn't recommend or buy again.
4,Lovely print,"I love all things- Nuncio. It is quite stylish and comfortable at the same time. You can easily wear these w/ jeans or a nice pair of dress pants. As well they can be worn all day. I wouldn't suggest 24/7 on your feet walking around kinda wear, but where 50/50- walking & sitting sort of wear. They look damn hot and if you want more of a height w/ the same kinda hotness & comfort- Nine West Barbe is another way to go!"
5,eye catching shoes,"I bought these shoes for my in-laws 50th wedding anniversary party. I wore a red dress and black tights. these shoes were so pretty and actually comfortable. I received tons of complements! I love how they look,so pretty and shiny, perfect heel height."
2,UNCOMFORTABLE - DISSAPPOINTMENT,"these shoes are so uncomfortable, i am so sorry that i bought them. They really look nice but i tell u they are uncomfortable and they will rub ur foot."
1,A REAL SNOOZER!,"By the end of the first chapter of this book, I though it moved dreadfully slowly. I foolishly continued reading in the hope that it would eventually pick up the pace. Although the authors' vision of a world without the American revolution or the technology-spawning World Wars is not totally without interest, there are no truly new ideas here, and everything is presented in a wordy, overwrought style I find reminiscent of Dumas sans self-effacing humor. I cannot honestly recommend this book to anyone other than insomniacs."
3,A good attempt ... yet rather unbelievable,"As a alternate history lover i immeadiately picked up Turtledove's book. I was amazed however at the slow pace once i began reading. The ""authors"" can't seem to decide between developing the characters or building a believable alternate world. This indecision left the book lacking in story and left me wanting more. Still...read the book and decide for yourself."
2,Rather disappointing,"A potentially fascinating alternate history situation, the American Revolution that never happened but some how bothTurtledove and Dreyfus create a slow moving and unsuspenseful story and pedestrian writing. The characters have little depth or believability, and not surprisingly, the dialogue is cornball. The biggest disappointment is that more details aren't presented on the alternate history, the why's, how's, and effects. The inclusion of the ""Tricky Dick"" character was a cheap shot that's hard to believe anyone would consider humorous or clever. Turteldove failed to delive as in The Guns of the South, its as if his name was printed on the book just to increase sales."
2,A rather poor effort,"An interesting plot and thought-provoking premise is subverted by very poor, cliche-ridden writing. Richard Dreyfuss should stick to acting, and Turtledove should stick to winning Hugos."
4,"Better than I expected, but not Turtledove at his best","This book was panned by the mainstream critics, but I enjoyed it. It is not as good as The Guns of the South or the Worldwar series, but that's praising with faint damns. The characters are interesting, the parallel world is plausible (though it's not entirely clear why the British Empire of the 1990s is so far behind our world -- no WWII to stimulate technical progress? that's my guess, but he gives no hint) and the action satisfying. If Turtledove has a flaw, it's that he writes too many books. I shouldn't complain of that, as I eagerly read each one that comes out. But if his publishers agree with me, there's an easy solution: pay him more!"
3,Fairly standard alternate history,"The Two Georges starts out with a typical development of the political and technical state of affairs in a North America where the American Revolution didn't happen. The plot centers around a murder mystery and art theft. But when the investigation is run by the head of the Los Angeles office of the national police, who then starts chasing around the country after feeble clues, the book goes downhill. The insipid love match between the hero and one of the prime suspects adds nothing. I don't know who contributed what to this collaboration, but it was not up to Turtledoves Guns of The South or Different Flesh alternate lines."
1,Unreadable!,"I was very excited to read this book when I first heard about it. The scenerio sounded very interesting. However, the book is so bad it is unreadable. I gave this book about 75 pages and got nowhere with it. For me the author is very hit or miss. Guns of the South and How Few Remain I felt were very good books. The authors WWII vs. Aliens from outerspace book I also found unreadable. I had the same problem with his Great War saga. But as for this mess, please do not waste your time or money."
1,Not for me.,"I usually enjoy Alternative History, but most of this book was not good in my opinion. The very idea of still being a British subject (even though I am an American expatriate) leaves a very bad taste in my mouth. I have heard Brits brag that America would be better off if we were still a colony, but that talk is just blusster. Also the idea that blacks would still be second class citizens (which this book advocates) does not bode well for a British controlled America."
3,RU sure this wasn't written by Mike Myers ?,To me this reads more like a satire of American attitudes to Britain... I mean... Steam Cars !?
2,The Two Georges- Fine Turtledove,"But Richard Dreyfuss? I mean, come on. You know you can't read it without hearing the voice of Richard Dreyfuss in your skull for several hours. As fascinating as the story was, I couldn't help but feel aggravated. Why couldn't the guy have said he was like Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, if he insisted on name-dropping? Sheeeesh."
4,Interesting and very well written,I am a very big fan of Alternate Fiction and I found this book to have a very unique and interesting plot. The Master of Alternate History (Turtledove) writes a book that will grab hold of you and not let go until you finish. I also thought how both Turtledove and Dreyfuss described a world run by only 4 powers was fascinating but gave the British a little too much power. The only regret of this book is that it doesn't go into more detail about how this world became formed and how each nation/empire became what it was. I recomend this book to anyone as a very good book to read for alternate history fans as well as mystery fans
4,The World Without Yankee Engineering,"I bought this book months before and set it aside. During a rainy afternoon, I finally broke down and read this delightful alternate history of the world without the power of the United States. I appreciate the authors not hitting the reader over the head with the changes that occured in the world without the Yankee genius. It's not my favorite Turtledove, but I is a very interesting and moving story about the world without a revolutionary spirit. I recommend it."
4,Well-done mystery; alright as alternate history,"This is a worlds till stuck in colonial; as though without the influence of the United States, none of the other colonies would have bothered making trouble either. Once that somewhat unlikely premise is accepted, it's a lot more subtle a world than it seems. The main character starts out believing that all is okay, but through the influence of his partner, the woman he falls in love with, and a few encounters woth various people of the ""lower classes"" he comes to realize that the world might not be quite the paradise he thought it was. That point is definitely there, but it's a bit too subtle, suborned as it is to the mystery/thriller aspects of the story, which are well-done, if, as with most of Turtledove's works, a bit on the slow side. (But the ride there is so entertaining!) I definitely recommend this book."
3,Interesting premise but very ponderous,The beginning of this book was quite well done. I found the idea that without the revolution the US would be a little less advanced than we are now an interesting idea. The problem with this book is that we are taken on a trip to parts of the country that is not interesting or relevant to the story just to meet people. I don't understand why we had to meet JFK except just to meet him. Ultimately he didn't contribute to the story line. The ending was disappointing also. A lot of it was taken on faith and the need to wrap the book up. I would be interested in seeing which author contributed what portions of the book.
2,"A Good Premise, but a disappointing Book","I love Harry Turtledove every since reading ""The Guns of the South"". Every book I've read has been awesome, so I picked up ""The Two Georges"". Slow paced isn't even the word for it. I think the problem was the two Authors couldn't decide if they wanted to paint a portrait (forgive the pun) of the main Character, or of the Changed America's. Something was definitely lost in the translation either way. I found myself not caring about the Mounty's personal life and just wanted him to find the darned painting. I'm still a Fan of Harry's but I'll certainly not read any more books with him sharing the credits."
1,Both Georges are no doubt spinning in their graves.,"This by far the worst book I have ever read. I finished it only because I was looking for the punch line. There wasn't one, and I've never so regretted time wasted. Since I've never read a Turtledove, I'm not sure who to blame here. I suppose I can blame both: A good writer would have made an attempt to fix the book, halt it's release, or take his name off the front cover. The action is clunky, the prose is stilted, the dialogue is unnatural and cliche, and the premise is as uninteresting as it is unimportant."
3,"Boy oh Boy. This book is long dull, and tedious.","The basic premise(Washington took the colonists grievances before the king) is alright but the whole time you are expecting action, which you don't get.I am a big Turtledove fan but this one is just totally implausible. Just as example there is the whole premise that Washington actually made George the 3rd understand the colonists problems. Then he has a change of heart and offers them dominion status. How is this possible? George III was a self indulgent arrogant guy why would he suddenly have a change of heart?In some parts the book is solid but it always drops back into somebody complaining about how wild the town has recently gotten. It goes solidly for the first 200 pages and then falls apart.The little bit about Napoleon was pretty inventive I thought but they didn't carry that too far.Overall-Buy if you are a SERIOUS fan, this should not be your introductory Turtledove book."
1,Hard to find anything this badly written,"I suppose I have read worse novels, but it is hard to find anything in print that is written this badly. The characters are wooden, the dialogue ponderous and cliche-ridden (if Bushnell had used one more ""Lucifer"" to light a ""slender tube"" or a cigar I would have used a ""Lucifer"" on the book!) and the plot so short of possibility as to be insulting. The premise held promise, but it just didn't get developed. As a historian and a fiction fan, I was expecting so much more."
1,Spare us!,"This is a what if scenario based on the idea that America never got out from under the thumb of the British and the British Empire still exists. It's set in America and the authors would have us believe everyone is still bowing and scraping before the British King-Emporer (!) Charles III. It's every character's dream to put Sir in front of his name, including the main man and his sidekick. We have people like this in Britain. We despise them. The underlying story is of a murder but this gets lost in the depiction of a seriously unpleasant society where no one questions the authority of a political system based on class and privilege, or the right of an unelected monarch to political power. On top of that, it's overlong, badly written and boring."
1,Snoozer,"Each time I sat down to read this book, I found myself nodding off. I wanted it to be a good read. I love most of Harry Turtledove's work and was optimistic about Richard Dreyfuss as an author. Man was I disappointed."
2,I could sit through it once. Barely!,"I didn't know that this was 99.999% animation and CGI. The story was week, and you couldn't care less about the characters. The only reason I sat through the whole thing was to see if it ever made sense."
4,"Strange, but enjoyable","I once saw this movie from the middle and I was intrigued, but failed to follow up. Recently I searched and found it, and since seeing the movie in it's entirety, I have to agree with others that there are questions lingering when the movie is over, but for the most part it is an enjoyable movie."
5,One of the truly great animation capture films,"Thanks, I've bought this flick 4 x for gifts; ranks right up there with Avatar! The actors are veterans too. Charlotte Rampling,and Thomas Kretchmann are super!"
2,Visually Interesting But Empty Calories,"Note that the movie contains human actors and the majority of the cast are computer animated characters. I can only assume this was done to save on union fees to actors and make up. Its a pretty moview with lots of potential. Unfortunately we don't know why Horus is goign to be killed by the gods, we don't ever know who or what John is or where Jill came from. You get left with a lot of dead ends which is a bit disappointing considering the potential that was here"
1,CRAP,"HATED HATED HATED IT. This is an anime-style film i nearly turned it off after 7 minutes..but it ended up being one of those wastes of time you watch all the way through, hoping the plot will actually come together. Although the graphics are well done here, that cannot redeem this blank, confusing, completely void of semblance, film. The writer obviously wrote it for himself, simply assuming the general public would actually be able to follow this dizzy storyline. This film is made for people on hallucinagens."
2,ALL OVER THE PLACE!,"I can't give this movie more than about 2.5 stars. It's just so far out there and it is definitely not able to reach a large audience. As a huge sci-fi fan I had to take a look, and I was mildly amused. The plot is incredibly stupid and the filmmakers could not decide whether the characters should be live action or CGI. The floating pyramid with the CGI Egyptian gods inside playing board games pretty much sums it up. Enjoy at your own risk."
3,Inconsistent production and confusing storyline,"For the most part, I enjoyed this movie, but the experience was bumpy, mostly because the quality of the visuals were inconsistent. Some scenes were gorgeous, while others (the Gods in the pyramid, in particular) looked like something out of a 90's video game. The story was a little hard to follow, but if you like hard sci-fi, you'll probably enjoy it."
2,Confusing!,"Not what i expected. There were times I got confused in some sections of the movie. The story line made sense, yet, I wasn't that impressed with the acting. I think its better as a SciFi Channel movie."
1,Easily one of the worst movies ever.,If you mix Playstation 1 graphics with bad acting and a worse story the result would be this movie.
2,Way too artsy... Characterization weak....,"Immortal is a artsy sci-fi film set in a gray over-industialized-Cyber-Punk-like future. The graphics are an interesting mix of live-action and CGI- some of which works and some of which doesn't.Jill is a weird blue mutant, who wears black latex and cries blue tears. Nikopol is an escaped ex-con. When Nikopol is possessed by the God Horus, the randy god he must have a mate, and that mate is Jill. Horus then proceeds to rape Jill. Several times. Bleh.I got the impression the film makers were trying to be too 'artsy' with this film, that I ended up being alienated. I also wasn't too attached to Nikopol or Jill and couldn've done without the rape scenes. 2 stars."
3,A surprisingly good film...,"I wasn't expecting much from this one, but I picked it up anyway. I have read that it felt like a combination of The Fifth Element and ___ movie. I'd agree, I'd say it was a combo of The Fifth Element and a largely unseen movie titled Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within (if you've seen both films, and you enjoyed them, this one is definately for you). It felt, in a way, also like a Terry Gilliam movie, the director of Brazil and Time Bandits. It did not have the darkness of Blade Runner, but it did convey a similar sense of a more realistic vision of an urban future, if relying heavily on CGI (unlike BR). I hope this review helps!Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases. So, you'll want to look for other reviews and reviewers if that is what you are looking for..."
2,What a waste!,"The movie is awsome and everything written in the other reviews is correct. Just one BIG screw up:The original movie is in french. The original graphic novel was written in french. As showed in the special features the filmakers spent months to lipsinc the entire movie with the lines in french.So why in heaven would they REMOVE THE ORIGINAL SOUND IN FRENCH FROM THE DVD??? What the hell did they have in mind??? There's plenty of space for both english and french sound!BIG mistake! They didn't even put subtitles in the begining of the movie when the gods are speaking to each other in a weird language (neither french or english). What they say is VERY important for the entire plot. In the french version they included subtitles in this part...Summary: Great movie, awful release..."
1,Stay clear of this Bluray,"There are several problems with this disc. Picture quality is terrible, barely dvd standard, and the TrueHD audio is all messed up. The center channel audio comes from the right speaker, you need to use the DD2.0 track to get channels right.Skip this, atleast until a proper bluray version is released if that should ever happen."
3,Mixed feelings here,"The story of this movie is especially interesting if you realize that a second, even third, part must be coming to explain many -and I mean MANY- loose knots. If seconds aren't coming you would be allowed to say Immortal is a strange dream taken to the screen but somehow worth the 102 minutes it last.The really ugly part of the movie are the poorly executed computer generated characters, in fact, for the possible exception of a couple of monsters, they are awful, move terrible and don't transmit anything to the viewer. Why didn't the director use humans? A fat man, a tough girl... surely they would cost more or less than the graphics did.Said that I think it's an interesting movie. Check it out, but have in mind it's a bizarre story."
5,OMG Finally!,"Love great sci-fi, and this one ties in ancient aliens with a good story, great cinematography and effects. We loved it!"
3,Good Movie,This was a good movie. Animation with real actors was done very well. Story line kept your interest.
2,Pretty but dull,This one looks like a good idea and the film is pretty to watch but the story is bloody and confusing. I had no idea what was going on and after about 30 mins I really didn't care. It was a blood bath in a horrible future city that had no point at all. The CGI was cheap looking but mixing it with live actors was a nice touch. If the plot were better it would be a film worth watching.
1,Are you kidding me!?!,"Honestly, the violence blows. They took a great premise for the story and just went places they should not have. The special effects were interesting, not sure how to classify the techniques. They were kind of a live-action combined with digital animation. I'd avoid watching or buying this one."
4,A Breath of Fresh Air...,"When I sat down to watch the ""Immortal"" screener that I had gotten at my video-store job, I thought, ""Looks sweet."" It pulled me in right away. The world that I was watching reminded me of ""Tron""-meets-""5th Element""-meets-""Ghost in the Shell"" with a little bit of ""Stargate"" thrown in for balance. Then I was knocked out of the film by some old-school (I mean like 1998 PC graphics!) animation for some of the characters. But slowly I began to sucked back in because the whole damn flick was so...cool. Original does not even begin to cover it.Ted Osborne"
4,Pretty good film,This movie has its share of flaws but it is definitely a movie worth watching if your a sci-fi fan. I like how they integrated computer graphics for some of the movie's characters and scenes. This movie actually almost felt like Fifth Element without the colorful cast of characters and interesting plot. Not to say that this movie doesnt have some interesting characters because it does. I just think this movie could've been better executed and it couldve had a 5 star rating instead. I've never read the books that supposedly go along with this movie so I have nothing to compare it to but nonetheless it was an interesting movie.
4,"Blu-ray, yes, but...","This beautiful science fiction story works out more enjoyable in blu-ray technology, this is an incontrovertible truth. The image quality in this edition it is superior beside of DVD image, of course. But the sound... I can not understand why this edition misses the 5.1 sound system, specially when blu-ray has the capacity of offers that and more. By the way, people at First Look Pictures keep the same special features (and nothing else) than DVD edition; but I assume they did not have aditional material. If you already own Immortal DVD edition and want to have it in blu-ray quality, do not simple throw the DVD. Maybe you sometimes rather to hear a powerful sound istead of watch a clear image."
4,candy for eye and mind,"Visually stunning, this is a melding of cgi and live actors that works. The sets are very realistic and fascinating and the movie is a delight to watch on par with Bladerunner or Dark City. The script, however, is it weakest point, having a few holes in the story line that make it confusing to follow at times. Those with a knowledge of the Director fare better than those of us getting our first taste. This is also definitely a movie that benefits from watching more than once. The second time I viewed, I knew I had to pay a lot closer attention to some background details to help me understand what was happening, and I enjoyed the second viewing a lot more. Worth adding to any collection."
2,Don't be seduced by a neat idea and cover ART,"I can usually tell within the first 10 minutes if a movie will be total crap, and this one tricked me. From then on I kept asking myself why, oh WHY am I still watching this? I guess it was like a train wreck.It's terrible, and eventually you'll be thinking the only people who could watch this MUST be on acid."
5,trippy movie,The effects on this one blew my mind. This is a blu-ray perfect to throw on at a party or with a couple of friends.
3,"weird, yet entertaining",This movie is a surreal blend of computer generated characters wixed with live action and is filmed in an etherial wash of blue/gray colors. It reminds me of Dark City meets Lost City of Children.
3,Atmospheric,"not great, but really interesting experience nonetheless. I enjoyed the slow pace and strange, almost immersive, mood. Sub-standard SFX, compared to a Hollywood production but quite good for the budget."
1,How can so much effort produce so little,I am a major fan of sci fi but am easily willing to admit when a film is unappealing at any level. I found nothing about the imagery extraordinarily interesting or original. Nor could I find anything redeeming in the unnecessarily convoluted story line.The constant shift from live actors to crappy CGI characters was also disengaging. They should have simply chosen to use all real actors -possibly cgi enhanced- or all cgi. The contrast between the two only accentuated the poor digital rendering.
1,Immortal,Just awful. They tried to combined live action with computer animation. It hasn't worked before and it doesn't work here. If they had just stuck to the computer animation it might not have been that bad. Skip this one.
1,IT sucks doesn't even begin to describe this movie.,"I have read and can appreciate many comic book based films...but this movie barely deserves to be sold and certanly not in 4 different editions. From the opener all the way through to the end the graphics in this movie are elementary at best. The charachters are wholy unbelievable and the storyline if there actually is one is poor at best. This movie has worse graphics than most Saturday morning cartoons.I would like my money back, but that is not possible...so I'll watch this movie burn into a nice pile of black platic instead. Seroiusly don't waste your time and money on this poorly written and executed movie.Don't waste your money on this movie. It isn't even worth paying $1 to rent it from the RedBox at McDonalds."
2,"Bad CGI, Bad plot, Bad acting","I'd like to discuss one of the key elements in storytelling - it's called plot. And if you enjoy plot as much as I do, you will snore through this movie. The movie features entire characters who are actually horrible 2D ""Vice-City"" looking CGI - the lips never sync with the words. The only saving grace of the movie is that it's visually impressive, but then again, so is The Lion King, and you don't see me running out to buy that. Why is it that modern Sci-Fi movies and shows are consistently plagued with this kind of garbage? Bad writing, no plot, characters we don't relate to, bad acting, the list goes on and on. Where's Richard Greco when you need him? Lol."
3,Maybe I Was Wrong,"When I smelled this in the department store, I thought it was a great second option for me. I normally wear Jean Paul Gaultier. I'm not really into this smell. I still use it because its paid for, but i'm not convinced this is the real deal. I plan on going to my department store to compare the smells of what I have and what they offer. If its the same, then i'll apologize. Either way, i'm not adding this to my routine."
4,"Love the perfume, but don't get it from Dole suppliers!","Finally got the item, after the due date, when it was too late.. thank God at least they wrapped it nicely. Yes, that helped! Now, On the negative side: no samples, like from other suppliers, and more important, so upsettingly late, it came after our aniversary.. then why bother to order it, better go get it from the mall.. This is my first experience when i order via amazon and it arrives late, though it was from a third party named Dole.. So.. i learned the lesson, never again from them. Sorry."
5,I love it,"Scents are often hard to review - you like the scent, you hate the scent, but how do you describe it? Well, Fahrenheit was introduced in 1988 and became a real hit. Containing bergamot, honeysuckle, hawthorn, sandalwood, nutmeg, violet, cedar, patchouli and tonka bean, it has a tea-like, delicious smell that practically makes my mouth water.I love the smell of it on my man, and when I smell it on him, it makes me want to grab him and just luxuriate in that smell. So, I guess you could say that I love it. It's not musky, or what I would call earthy - it's more flowery, but in a deeper masculine manner than women's perfume - like I said, it makes me think of a fragrant tea. Anyway, give yourself a treat, and buy your man a bottle of Fahrenheit by Christian Dior - or, give your woman a treat and buy a bottle for yourself!(Review of Dior Fahrenheit)"
5,Good Stuff,"I admit I have not used a ton of different types of cologne, but out of all of them, Fahrenheit is the greatest. I purchased a small bottle of this stuff about 4 or 5 years ago. I still have some left, I just can't bring myself to finish it off, I think I might have 20 or so sprays left.Sure it is masculine, but it is not by any means musky. It has a somewhat sweeter scent than average, when it comes to stuff like this geared for a dude. It just smells awesome and thats what counts."
4,I really like it,"Fahrenheit by Dior has a fragrance like no other... I've been fascinated by this fragrance ever since I can remember.It is bold and fragrant... generally people seem to either like it a lot or hate it. It seems a little overpowering at first but as I said, you either like it or hate it.the fragrance is masculine no doubt and it's not something that I'd use in summer... essentially a night fragrance."
4,He smells great!,"My fiance requested this as a gift. Although sceptical, I got it for him anyway. You can't go wrong with this cologne."
3,Ultimate_PMP1,"I was expecting more in terms of duration of themes, details in techniques and calculations aspects and, mostly some illustrative answers to typical questions with the ""why not"" of some multiple choice responses. I was desappointed and was ready to return the product. To my perspective, ignoring the answers to multiple choice questions make this product half of its value and the word ""ultimate"" shoud not appear in its title. If, for some reasons, someone has only these DVD's as reference, he has less than 20 % of what it is needed and cannot pass the PMP examen."
3,Important for the die hard collectors or handy-men,"This book is a must have for the do-it-yourselfers that need to have specs for props from the show Doctor Who. The book has specs. for Daleks, K-9, guns and the Tardis. The only resource for constructing the program's props."
3,Great For Whovians,"A great set of details of the props used on the show, including several of the weapons, the TARDIS, and so on. Espcially amusing for children."
5,Great Book for all Doctor Who Fans,"Have owned for years. Book is full of great information about the show and most of the important characters in the series. Has information on everything from the Tardis, K9 the Doctors Car and the Cybermen. Includes several colour photos from the show.A must have for any Doctor Who fan."
2,"Broke after 6 months, about 10 uses","The top intersection of the arms and the center column is a plastic piece with tabs, one of which broke. Now the center column can slip out of place. Probably not worth making a warranty claim since labor is only covered for 90 days. Perhaps epoxy will do the trick."
5,Nice for the money,Haven't used this tripod yet but went over it with a fine tooth comb. Looks like quality construction and everything seems to work just fine. I'm sure it will hold a pretty heavy camera and it operates very smoothly. For the money it will suit my needs just fine and I think it's a great deal.
4,"Well built, for lightweight use...","I ordered this tripod to use with my Sony A77. It is very light and solidly built, but it is more of a video tripod. As other reviewers have mentioned, the pan function is very smooth for video recordings. However, I purchased Sony 70-300G lens recently, and I can see that the legs get a little bit shaky. I also purchased same pricedRavelli Professional 65"" Ball Head Camera Video Photo Tripod with Quick Release Plate and Carry Bagto compare, and so far, I like Ravelli's better for DSLR. It is about 10"" taller than Sony, fully extended or closed, and has a ball head and twist-and-lock mechanism. Overall, if you have a lighter camera/lens combo, you will definitely enjoy this Sony tripod."
4,Good price with descent functions,"I bought this tripod after reading many reviews. I'v had a ball head tripod which is nice for my DSLR cameras but not good for my small sized camcord. The Sony VCT-R640 works very nicely. It is light, and flexible for all directions for the camcord. Overall I like it very much, especially the long control handle, which is particularly good for video camera. The only reason I put this product on 4 stars is becasue it still feels a little bit jerky some times, not perfectly smoothy."
4,Like It,I just got this tripod to replace a broken one. I used it for a little bit. It meets my expectation per its price. Hopefully it can last for sometime.
5,Great tripod,"I was very impressed by this tripod, solid, sturdy construction. The only possible negative I can think of is that its a bit heavy, but for most people this is a plus. I would definitely recommend this tripod to a friend."
5,Good sturdy product,"Purchased this tripod mainly based on a video review on Amazon, it is very good and fits our Sony Alpha NEX-5. Well built, sturdy and very versatile. Only thing I can complain about, is that the seller sent it in an oversized box which didn't really offer any extra protection. The Sony tripod is excellent and I recommend wholeheartedly."
3,The video review makes this look better than it is,"I so wanted to believe this was going to be more than cheap plastic. It looks nice, but the crank like most tripods is way to cheap and will break with not much pressure like most tripods around this price. The legs fully extended make the tripod flimsy. Sun Pak's tripod for the same price may be a better choice than this tripod. For one thing the quick release is not replaceable on this Sony tripod. Most tripods around this price are the same quality and may only have minor differences that don't matter much. There is a huge price gap between a disposable tripod like this one and a good tripod, but hopeful if your careful with a tripod like this it will be fine for a while and do what you need it to do, unless you are seriously making videos/taking pics"
4,I'm pretty sure you can't do better for the price,"I'm very satisfied - I have a tripod that works, is inexpensive and has a good range of height adjustments. Highly recommended (no leveler though - you have to eyeball it)"
5,Not Bad for the Money,"I use this tripod for my Canon T2i. Not a bad tripod, I like the quick release and it seems stable. Plus its only $28 dollars, and works just fine with my 18-55mm IS and 75mm-300mm lens."
5,Love this Tripod,"This is a very sturdy, well made piece of equipment, a great buy at the price. It's easy to set up and to break down, steady as a rock, adjusts quickly and smoothly, and it's reasonably light -- although I wouldn't want to take it on a ling hike."
5,Great quality,"I'm using this tripod with a sony RX100 and it works PERFECT! This tripod does everything I need it to do, complete with a bubble level and a quick release. It also has a tilting head that allows you to go from landscape to portrait with ease (one of my favorite features). I looked at a lot of tripods and don't think you will find a better one in this price range. I'm very happy with this purchase."
5,Excellent tripod,"My friend was using this exact same tripod and I wanted to buy one for myself. I'm glad I did. It is incredibly light-weight, easy to use, and quite sturdy for the price. Highly recommend it! I also purchase the wireless remoteAmazonBasics Wireless Remote Control for Nikon Digital SLR Camerasto take self- and family- portraits. Both are great products."
3,Not Abridged! 3-CD Set.,"With John Gielgud, Kenneth Brannaugh and Bob Hoskins my hopes were high for this. But somehow Gielgud lacks the anger and power of Olivier's 1983 version. Also, actors sitting at a table reading into microphones somehow miss the passion of an actual performance. Still, there are a lot worse versions out there."
3,Interesting read,"I liked it more the further I got into it, but it's pretty out there to begin with. Not typical Chesterton."
3,For the hard-core Anglophile,"This, to me, is a good example of a book that is primarily premise. The idea of London being broken up into little city states is amusing, but Chesterton doesn't do enough with the comic possibilities. It was difficult for me to enjoy this book, while constantly being reminded of ""Passport to Pimlico,"" a much more whimsical take on the notion."
3,"Cute, but too tight","If you can, order this shoe a 1/2 size bigger. Unfortunately, the shoe doesn't come in a 10 1/2."
5,Rarely does a book change the way I live!,"I enjoyed going through life with a boy and accompanying him on his journey through manhood. I am not a ""spiritual"" person, and yet I found the spiritual guidance to be the most appealing part of the book. The boy learns lessons early in the book which come to fruition in his life in Chapters 27 and 28. The book reads like an autobiography, which is why it all seems so believable and workable in real life. Thanks, Mr. Moulton, for a great read!"
2,Very theoratical and very scholastic impractial!,"I wonder if anybody could really follow up what this book tried to deliver. Obviously, this was only a book written by two white-shoe scholars who never met any realistic danger in the streets but reading dangerous happenings everyday on the newspapers. If I really bought what this books theories(only theories), and really got into trouble with some attackers or assailants and trying to use the techniques(if they are techniques), I definitely would get killed right on the spot! This was a one-way-thought-so, or think-to-be personal safety textbook, but would only get people killed. I also almost got killed by the authors' zigzagging, circling-around-at-the-same-spot writing style, and felt dizzy all the time tring very hard not to lose focus. A terrible, horrible read! By the way, if I follow what the guy said in his foreword to blindly praise this book and really giving this book to everyone I know, I may lose their friendship permanently"
5,Possibly Putnam's most important book?,"The fact/value dichotomy remains a standing dogma of contemporary empiricism. One sees it assumed without question in numerous works intended both for students and professional philosophers. (It is taken for granted, for instance, in Peter Singer's recent A Darwinian Left.) Yet Putnam shows that the original dichotomy, usually attributed to David Hume, was based (1) on a metaphysics of fact that nobody has seriously entertained since the early days of Logical Positivism, and (2) on an argument formally identical to Hume's argument against causality, the latter being an argument virtually nobody now accepts as cogent. Putnam argues that we must now accept the embeddedness of values virtually all theoretical and even factual statements. This does not, however, drop us into a morass of post-modern relativism, but allows us to think more clearly about the value-assumptions we make in all forms of discourse."
1,Not what I was expecting,"When I received this product, it was a flimsy little binder with thin pages. The shipping weight was lower than the weight listed on here for product description. I emailed and they said they weren't aware of a weight difference and that this was the product. If you are looking for a nice hardcover textbook, this is not it."
1,The Unanticipated Trash,"This book is not appropriate for the age range for which it was written:( I was dismayed when half way through the book, the first swear word is used (not necessary), followed by the mother shoplifting vodka in her diaper bag and getting sauced, and son arguing with his father about the dog s*** everywhere. Would one allow their 4th grader to read this? This book confused me; who was it written for?"
1,A Chrldren's book?,"The reason I looked at this book is because I love cat stories, but have to question the wisdom of recommending this book for elementary age children. The review staes that one of the characters takes the Lord's name in vain. In addition the topic is certainly not one I would have chosen for my children at that age. I don't believe in censorship, but I find this book inappropriate and objectionable for ages you recommend."
3,well written by not historical enough,"Peter Brown is a prolific historian who focuses primarily on the textbook market, a needed professional in a field where many look down on doing such ""lay"" work. Well written the reader with not be bored. However, the book is so short and not really organized as a textbook so it makes it difficult to grasp how late antiquity differs from the earlier periods or the medieval world."
1,Perhaps my expectations are a bit high,"I met the author at a Borders some years ago and purchased all the books of this series. She is an exceptionally nice person, though her writing is lacking. I found the work cliche to the extreme. The grammar was questionable at best and the plot lacking. I do understand that people will read almost anything; judging from the reviews I doubt they even noticed the grammar issues.While I do admire the work put into these books, they are not a work I, as a writing teacher and editor, would ever allow a student to publish."
1,"Flat, Boring & Sophomoric",Sorry to say I read this with a big yawn. Perhaps the author had all 5 of his/her friends write favorable reviews.
2,An Assimilationist's View of History,"This is a tendentious little book that clings to a melting-pot notion of American history. While there is some truth to this history, Miller certainly overstates his claims. The fact is that large numbers of immigrants to this country resisted assimilation and many returned to their home countries to avoid the oppression and persecution they found in the U.S.Miller's writing is much akin to Arthur Schlesinger Jr.'s ""The Disuniting of America."" It is persuasive, but shallow."
5,Pleasant Surprise!,"I have carple tunnel and was not expecting to be able to use this product with ease, but I was pleasantly surprised! I had no problems and no wrist pain afterward! It sure beat pulling out the food processor to chop up a bit of garlic!I thought I might haveto cut the garlic cloves in small pieces--I didn't--I threw in a couple whole cloves and a couple twists and I had perfectly minced garlic! It also allows a lot of the ""juice"" to be extracted, resulting in a stronger garlic flavor.Clean up couldn't be simpler. (I shose to hand wash rather than putting it in the dish washer.)Seriously, I was completely surprised, not expecting much at all from this product! It is AWESOME!!!"
3,Get your lesser 80s hits here!,"This compilation album contains some of the lesser-known, more soft rock type hits of the 1980s. There are still some classic 80s tunes, including ""Waiting for a Star to Fall"" by Boy Meets Girl (my husband and I are such 80s music fans, we used this as our ""first dance"" song at our recent wedding!) and ""Shattered Dreams"" by Johnny Hates Jazz. There's also the wonderful ""Wouldn't It Be Good"" by Nik Kershaw, a song that was later covered by the Danny Hutton Hitters for the ""Pretty in Pink"" soundtrack. With the exception of Level 42's ""Something Abuot You,"" you may recognize the remaining artists on the album (Julian Lennon, Elvis Costello, Devo, Boy George), but not necessarily the songs. There are certainly some worthwhile titles on this CD, but if you are looking for a complete collection of classic 80s hits, there are better choices available."
5,One of the best non-fiction books I've read.,"If you are a WW2 buff then I highly recommend reading this book.The author, Richard O'Kane, became the Executive Officer on the Wahoo while she was under construction. He served on board until given command of his own submarine, Tang, so what is told in the book is as authentic as you can get.This should be on Oprah's book of the month club."
4,"Great, but heavy... buy the case.","I've had my new Tablet PC for a month and love it! I'm happy to be free of a mouse. I rarely use the keyboard...keep the unit flipped into the screen open position. Very sturdy construction. It IS heavy, but I found the reasonably priced leather case helps make the tablet easier to manage,transport and provides moderate protection. The case closes with the screen open ...perfect(part no. PA1388U-1NCS)."
4,Great Tablet!,"I have had my Toshiba tablet for a week now and love it. I was not entirely sure what to expect, though I did my homework. This works great for everything I need, both as a laptop and a tablet. I find that I am using it in tablet mode a lot and that I can proficiently do just about everything in tablet mode that I can do in laptop mode. The pen is easy to use and works great. The handwriting recognition is much more accurate than I expected.It does need more RAM. I am going to add 1GB (...) to take it up to 1.25 GB. Plan on adding some as tablet PC appears to consume more resources than regular XP.The unit is a little bulky. But again, it's rugged and is exactly what I was looking for. I would definately purchase this one again!! :)"
2,"Heavy, unreliable, quirky","I have had a Toshiba Satellite tablet PC for about 18 months. The first one had a power supply failure within 3 weeks of purchase at CompUSA. It was replaced. The tablet hot keys on the second unit never functioned correctly, the unit shut down regularly (blue screen) with an alleged video driver failure, I never got to the bottom of that. It came with insufficient memory, so I upgraded it to 1GB RAM. That improved performance. It recently stopped working again. CompUSA is refusing to repair it, although I have one of their fancy TAP extended warranties. They are saying I must have dropped it recently, which is not the case. So, no more Toshiba, no more CompUSA. I did love the tablet functionality and will buy another tablet PC, but not from Toshiba and not from CompUSA."
3,Toshiba Performs well,"Looks like it's a keeper. Toshiba likes to mess with Wireless control to it's detriment, but other than that, the system works pretty good. Sloooww getting an IP address, but then everything works OK. Like the Tablet, but putting in text could be a little more easy, if not more intuitive."
3,Of historical not artistic interest,"These are some of the tracks that made Al Jolson famous before he became a movie star. There are not many lasting hits here, but a reasonably good window onto the Broadway-dominated popular song mill of the 1910s."
4,The Nostalgia of Stanley's Performance,"For people of an age who grew up in Britain, Stanley Holloway will always be a treasured memory. In this CD that memory returns. I found it so amusing while playing it in the car that I thought my driving might be impaired! A really nostalgic experieince for Brits and a new experience for everyone else."
1,"Defective Discs, Terrible Packaging","Who is kidding whom here?The discs in this set are universally defective. In fact, if you got a set that didn't have a defective disc, you're lucky. They stall, they won't play, they're jittery, or the picture is pixelated. Whoever created the masters did an amateurish job. Even the menus on the discs are stupidly designed.Shame on Image for releasing this junk for sale. Even the cheap price doesn't make up for the fact that you can't watch 1 -5 of the discs.The packaging on this set appears to be nice, but it, too, is garbage. The discs are very difficult to remove from the sleeves. You may not be able to remove the discs in some cases, because they stick to the glossy cardboard sleeves.I'm returning my set for a refund, not a replacement."
5,Mom your incredible.,"This book is excellent for any women who has a family or is thinking of having a family, or thinking of not having a family. It covers all aspects of childraising, whether you are a stay at home or a working mom. It also reassures you that you are probably a pretty normal mom. Good days and bad days. It will also confirm that this is one of the biggest carreer choices that you can make. I found this book excellent and I've raised two children already. I feel all moms with children at home now should read this book and recommend it to thier friends. This is a very easy reading book. Smile, frown, and think with this book."
2,poor printing quality !!!,"After comparing the prints on Kodak premium high glossy photo paper and Canon glossy photo paper plus, that came with my Canon i560 printer, I decided to get way from Kodak. It shows very grany texture especially in the dark area and colors are very dull. Canon paper reproduces much vibrant color and texture. After my own experimentation with papers, I searched on internet to find reviews on many different brands of papers. It seems like Kodak papers in general don't have good ratings."
1,Wrong Size!,"The package says this is 4X6 paper, but it isn't. It's actually 4X6.5! I feel ripped off! What's the point of having a printer capable of edge to edge printing when I have to cut off an extra .5 inches on my pictures when using this paper? I've had good luck with Kodak's 8.5X11 paper which was the actual size advertised on the package. Why is this different?It just doesn't make any sense. Is this a design flaw on Kodak's part?"
3,Ok for the price,Product didn't fit as tightly as I had hoped. I have seen Yamaha covers that fit tightly while this one was on the baggy side. It's alright for the price.
1,No Good,I bought this case and it seems too small for the phone. On two occassions while taking short trips the phone was turned on and the battery died.
2,Pieces Don't Fit Together,"I bought the small version for my nephew, and spent a whole afternoon filing away at the notches in each piece (which were way too tight) so that they could fit together as they should. I had to buy a metal file to do so because the sandpaper included in the set wasn't heavy-duty enough, and even with the metal file, I had to spend so much time making each notch larger that we could only assemble a third of the dinosaur during a two hour session."
4,Parking Structures,"This book will never make any best seller list, but if your job includes maintaining a parking ramp then this book is not to be missed. It gives complete detail on planning, design, construction, maintenance, and repair of parking ramps in a way that anyone with a smidgeon of technical knowledge can read and understand. It shows what can go wrong due to weather and time and how to repair the problems. It explains mechanical and electrical systems that keep parking ramps functional. It offers insight into how parking structures are designed and built in words anyone can comprehend.In all this book is a necessity if you need to manage a parking system from a maintenance perspective. The ramp that I'm responsible for is less confusing to me now that I have this book to serve as my guide."
5,Thorough and Indepth,"As an architect and lighting designer who has personally been the project manager for 5 Parking Garages and involved in countless others there is no book available that is more complete. An excellent aid to anyone looking to enhance their understanding of the design of, construction, or maintenance of parking facilities. For those looking for just an understanding of the basic concepts behind parking garages including layout and ramp design start with the Dimensions of Parking also available on Amazon. But if you are looking for something more in depth and thorough this is the book, the sections on ADA and the proper design of accessible paths are worth the price alone."
2,This paper is NOT a true 4x6,"For some odd reason, Kodak chose to make this paper 4x6 3/8. So there will be one side with a 3/8"" white bar. This is really annoying. Otherwise, the pictures do turn out with very good photo quality. So buy only if you don't mind trimming the paper when you are done."
5,Great Story,"I have a biological and an adoptive daughter (from Ethiopia), and they both love this book. Great story and beautiful illustrations. One of our favorites, and we have a lot of books. It's the only one we've ever written a review about."
2,A bit disappointing...,"I bought SCREENTEST TAKE 1 for the Batman screentests. What was here was nice to see one time, but were obviously edited and incomplete. Also, there is unnecessary narration over the parts of it that were shown. ... Would I purchase a DVD of a Stones concert if it had a narrator commenting how good Jagger looks or how well the band held up over the years? I think not. CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS DVD EXCEPT FOR A CASUAL VIEW. Not worth the money, nor suitable for a permanent DVD library/collection/archive because of the above mentioned problems."
4,Corelle Hearthstone is very sturdy and looks beautiful on our dining table,"I was looking for the dinnerware that Albertsons had in their store awhile back and found some matches on Amazon..so was thrilled to see they were here and ordered..my order they handled perfectly..this was my first order with Amazon and I would shop here again..thank you, Kathy"
5,Slim fast Low Carb Snack bar,These snacks are delicious. Do not leave an after taste and are very low in carbs. Great treat when you are dying for something sweet.
4,"be careful of the sugar alcohols though,","these bars are delicious, but if you have trouble digesting sugar alcohols like maltitol, you can get some pretty serious ""gastric disturbances"""
3,No recipe book or tips came with it,"We just bought the Brinkmann Charcoal Smoker. Very disappointed at the lack of ""how to"" info that came with it. I don't even see where I can buy a book from Brinkmann. I also think it should have have come with a cover. (it didn't)."
5,excellent adapter,"Workes perfectly. Our dock only had 50 amp 125volt service. We plugged this in and are able to split it to 2 30 amps. Very heavy duty, locking mechanism."
1,Major dissapointment,This is a reprint of the edition I have from 40 years ago! The language used in it is no longer being used in modern Greek. My children cannot understand have of the Greek words in it!!! Can you imagine taking a trip to Greece and trying to translate using this dictionary?
2,Talking heads are the most interesting part of this,"The host is great and some of the experts interviewed are fine, but the rest of the material is sub-standard. Witness the recreations of scenes from the books: The hobbits are played by midgets wearing tacky feathered hats - the guy playing Frodo is probably 70 years old. The guy playing Aragorn, on the other hand, is maybe 28 and probably moonlights as an underwear model. Very little included about Tolkien's interesting life and how it shaped his Middle-earth stories. While I love the Brothers Hildebrandt illustrations, these are used so often you get tired of them.Think of this as a very poor Cliff Notes for the video age. If it were my first exposure to Tolkien, I'd never look further."
2,Poor production values,"I bought this for the Brothers Hildebrandt images of which I am a huge fan. The images on the DVD are fuzzy and small. 2nd Disc ""Landscapes of Middle Earth"" has no images or maps, just music. For the serious Tolkien fan this is a VERY disappointing product. Save your money."
3,Pretty Good Despite Low Budget,"J.R.R. Tolkien: Master Of The Rings manages to be a fairly informative and entertaining piece of work despite its obivious low budget. Even this is only a major hinderance in the footage enacting scenes from The Lord Of The Rings, which resemble nothing so much as some home videos made by a bunch of guys in the Society for Creative Anachronism.Having said that, there are many good bits here, the most impressive of which are the computer-generated 3D maps of Middle-earth, which are actually quite stunning.One final word to the Tolkien neophyte: if you haven't read Lord Of The Rings all the way through, DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM. There is a detailed plot synopsis of the entire novel toward the beginning of the movie which reveals the ending of the book. If you haven't read LOTR and feel you must watch this, make sure you skip Chapter 4 on the chapter menu."
1,[Totally Bad],"Being a life long fan of Lord of the Rings I purchased this to expand my knowledge of the man who wrote this masterpiece. Unfortunatly most of this documentary is spent in presenting an extremely abriged, and many times inaccurate, version of the books. If I wanted a watered down version of the books I would buy the Animated versions instead as they were at least entertaining. This on the other hand is boring to the extreme as a nasal voiced narator, bad computer graphics, and the horribly poor artwork of the brothers Hildebrant gang up to mutalate a great story. Don't purchase this DVD, instead I suggest you pick up the National Geographics documentary which has amazing production value and much more information on Tolkien."
2,Nothing I didn't already know. Don't waste your money!,"If you are interested in learning about Tolkien read Humphrey Carpenter's excellent biography rather than wasting money on this DVD. The only thing of interest on this disc is the footage of Tolkien himself, but there's not enough to make the price you pay worthwhile. The majority is taken up by a badly performed synopsis of the story. Also includes a disc of totally boring music supposedly inspired by LOTR. Buy Howard Shore's soundtrack to the Peter Jackson films if you want great music that really sounds like it fits the story."
3,It is an O.K. product,this is a good product just don't have kids that like to climb on things when you get it for your house otherwise it's stomach will pull apart and the legs will not stand straight
3,Introduction to Canada needs more substance,"This film was presented in the Canadian Pavilion at the Seville, Spain Expo in 1992. It is a collection of sights and sounds from across Canada, without any narration, designed to appeal to an international audience. Like many IMAX films, it suffers from appearing on a smaller tv screen. However, with such a short running time and without a more in depth theme, general audiences will find this film wanting. There is a 6 minute Making Of Momentum, but the narrator's voice gets a bit lost in the audio mix. This film will be of primary interest to fans of things Canadian and IMAX tech, and as a snapshot of this era in the far future."
5,"Great Book! (and tiny, too)","This book manages to fit almost the whole of O-Chem between it's shiny covers. It is the perfect O-Chem handbook/reference guide. A novice may need an additional supplementary text, but otherwise this book is a goldmine."
5,AIC RIP,"First show for AIC in three years and also the last one ever. This DVD shows everything from these NY recordings, even when they get lumpy (True. the audio cd won't show these mistakes). Anyway, as a fan of AIC, this DVD is a must have for your memories."
5,The Killer Is ME,"Wow, this performance by Alice In Chains blew me away. It was their first live show in almost 3 years and while watching the DVD you can just tell that they really did love performing. Layne Staley was one of the greatest vocalists of all time, when he sings you can feel the emotion. Jerry is an amazing and underated guitar player, he has a beautiful voice as well. This show is a little sad though, the atmosphere on most of the unplugged shows are very moody. This DVD rocks and AIC set a standard for modern rock/alternative. My favorites are ""Heaven Beside You"" and the unreleased song ""The Killer Is Me""... it has an amazing chorus and guitar riff. If you like AIC, this is highly recomended."
4,Alice in Chains:Unplugged,My boyfriend loved it. He is a musician and really likes a lot of the songs on this cd. Great to watch!
5,"Great, like everything AIC has ever done.","I don't know why that loser James G's comment is at the top, but Alice in Chains and Layne's performance were both amazing. Maybe James G needs to have his music processed and run through the mix board, or just can't appreciate live music, but Layne was awesome in this Unplugged. Got Me Wrong was WAY better than on SAP. It is actually the song that got me into AIC. The video also has a few funny moments and a screw-up on Layne's behalf that is quite comical. RIP Layne PS Bass Guitar is easy. That is why Mike Starr was easily replaced. Will never replace Layne."
3,Great Show - Misleading Sale!,"Show are great. However do not get conned into thinking you are ordering a blue-ray, because you are not. the lengths people go to make a dollar.. =("
5,"No, I'm the man in the box","Which isn't on this collection, but then some songs wouldn't translate to an unplugged perfomance. The most amazing contradiction to this was ""Would?"", which absolutely rocks both on Dirt and on this DVD!. All songs are great, though you can see Layne fading away and screwing the the lyrics on ""Sludge Factory"". Layne, RIP. Jerry Cantrell is the leader of this group that by this time had Mike Inez as the bass player. Who's the drummer again? My wife says he's one of the best drummers around. What does she know??? Yeah, ok, he's good. This DVD rocks, its a must have, even if you aren't a metal head. what the hell is a metal head anyway? This is just damn good music... Oh yeah, I forgot, I'm a metal head."
4,IT'S GREAT FROM START TO FINISH!!EXCEPT??,"THIS IS A GOOD VIDEO FOR PEOPLE WHO LIKE WATCHING A GREAT BAND PERFORM GREAT SONGS.THE ONLY DRAW BACKS ARE IT'S DEPRESSING TO SEE STALEY SO FRAGILE AND SICKLY,ALSO ONE OTHER THING THE BAND WHILE THEY'RE GREAT MUSICALLY THEY ARE THE MOST NON-FUNNY AND CORNY PEOPLE ON THE PLANET(JUST SHUT UP AND PLAY)LEAVE THE COMEDY TO THE COMEDIANS."
2,Bad Merchendise,"I ordered two of the AIC Ungplugged DVD's. Neither will play in any of my new DVD or BlueRay players. I had to bust out an old modded XBOX that I had to watch them. One sounds great but the other had high music sound but low vocals, barely hear Layne or Jerry singing. Both will play on my laptop and computers. I read and asked the seller about the region 1 codec. They stated that they would play but in reality they only play on older DVD players and on PC's. I paid $10 a piece so I guess I'm not complaining too much but it is an inconvenience. It will cost me more than I paid to ship them back and get my money so I am going to keep them. One positive if the video quality is great. The packaging (case) leaves me to believe these were dubbed cuz they came from the UK. I could have done that on a torrent site but...well I didn't. It's a hit of miss with these so be careful. If you're expecting something from Best Buy don't count on it."
1,Shape=Worthless,The mere shape of this shaped cd makes it impossible to play in most players...don't waste your money. I can't even listen to it because my players won't accept it.
4,A damn fine collectable,"I was given this shaped cd by my best friend who lives overseas. I had just recently discovered Primal Fear through buying the immaculate release 'Seven Seals'. So to have this arrive in the mail was just bliss for me. First I found it hard to find any cd player in my house that would play this beaut, but that's when my trusty cd walkman came in handy. The 5 tracks put down on this e.p. are very much worthy additions & would leave the original artists praising their renditions over & over. Fantastic Power Metal like it should be. Go & buy it."
3,There is hate in the eye of the eagle,"I gave it three stars because it was only an EP. But read my review...........Its funky, its different and so what if it doesn't play in your car or in your computer, its still cool to collect. I paid $10 for mine when I was in Chicago's Metal Haven. I'm a Primal Fear fan and I played it once and put it on the shelf with the other CD's that I own. Because of it's uniqueness its something that I collected and treasure so I want to perserve it. It's something for the fan who don't collect LP's anymore."
5,Unappreciated TV show,"I loved this TV show, which had a very short run. I would like to see the whole series on DVD."
4,large Tyrannosaurus Rex wooden 3D Puzzle,"Well made, solid big 3-d puzzle. Gave it to my 4 year old ""dinosaur crazy"" nephew for Christmas '06. We all helped build it Chrismas Day.Huge! 5' tall x 6' long. Kids loved it!!!!Unfortunately the manufacturer should be ""pinged"" because the assembypictures are useless. Small numbers on the puzzle pieces are key, especially when you get to the small bones in the hands and feet.I'm an engineer, and it took 2 adults 1-1/2 hours to figure out the inside from outside- then left and right of the 3-D hand and foot bones.Glad I bought it. Plan on spending some ""quality time"" with you kids building it."
5,Verrrryyy Good Mouse !,"NOTE: This product is labeled as a Microsoft Wireless Optical Mouse 5000. The Mouse I am reviewing is a Microsoft Wireless IntelliMouse Explorer 2.0 as shown in the picture, and is the product I received when I ordered. It has 2 programmable buttons for the right thumb.Microsoft designed a real winner with this mouse. It is ergonomically designed ( for Right Hand ) and is very useful with programmable thumb buttons. This is my third one. I have worn out two others in the past six years. About 5 or 6 hours of use daily during the work week and some use on weekends. This design seems to be getting hard to find. I may buy another one just in case it won't be available in a few more years. I really Like this design and it functions perfectly with the customized button assignments."
4,Good Kettle - Got as a gift,"I got this kettle for my mother as a birthday gift (she asked for it!) and overall I liked the look and design of the kettle and only have one dislike about it which is why I gave it 4 stars. The top is very lightweight and when trying to open it you have to really pull. I expect this may be due to it needing the tight fit for it to whistle when it's done, but in my opinion the quality of the top could have been a bit better. With that said, she says she loves it."
1,"Horrible quality, rust inside after 6 months","Horrible quality, rust inside after 6 months in the form of small ""rust"" bubbles, a few here and there. Not obvious, unless you look inside with a lamp, although looks great on the surface. Will try to return it."
3,tools,"I have come into a Psion 5mx as a freebie. I am trying to set it up and am having a problem finding out how to set the communication link. The manual says to go to ""Tools"". Try as I may I cannot find this section to access the remote link. Any Help out there"
3,Good and Bad,"I bought the 5mx and promptly returned it. The Good is this little thing is a true computer-- not just a fancy organizer like the Palm. It's word program is very good. The Bad is the screen contrast is quite poor in my opinion. Without the back light, I had trouble seeing the text even in a well lit room. Also, the key board is small (as expected), but the disappointing part with the keyboard was I had to press firmly (kind of like a small calculator) for the key to register, as opposed to a soft touch like a computer. This really slows down the typing process. So for me, it just did not work out. However, if the screen contrast does not bother you and you are a ""hunt and peck"" typist anyway, this would be a great buy IMHO. Like I said above, it really is a little computer!"
1,very upset,"I purchased a psion organiser which i thought was new.What turned up must be 15years old , in fact it is an older version than the one i already have.I was away on business so didnt get to open it till i returned.Guess what to LATE. The only place for this psion is in the trash!"
1,don't waste your time with this,"If you are thinking of getting a PDA, get a PocketPC, Palm orHandheld PC.The Psion is really no good..poor screen quality and bad overallconstruction quality and it is difficult to synchronize with thedesktop."
2,Great Product-- Horrible Customer Service,"I have had a series 5 for 1 1/2 years. I love the size, capacity, features and display. Unfortunately, my Psion broke just in time to be out of warranty. The company will repair it for $160 without guarantee that it won't break again. I have heard from several others that their Psion Series 5 or 5mx also broke shortly after the warranty period had ended. Psion does not offer extended warranties, either. I have had a very poor experience with customer service; they are not helpful, and don't seem to care whether they maintain the customers they work so hard to acquire. Furthermore, I've noticed the company being more stingy, unaccomodating and generally customer-unfriendly over the past few years. I would be surprised if Psion stays afloat given the competitve climate for hand held computers out there."
2,Stay away from this.,"Bought the Kodak paper because of Kodak's good reputation. Well, it's overrated. This paper was horrible. Color clarity is just ok. At least 2 hours after we printed a picture, when we touched it, the ink was smeared. Near the edge of the photo, ink actually came off. HP and FujiFilm premium gloss paper worked 100% better. I've also tried the Epson paper which is good. Don't waste your money on this paper. Print a great memory with another kind."
4,Ignore Reviews Prior to July 2011,"First, ignore reviews written before July 2011--they are referring to a different re-recorded release of this album. The one listed here is a REMASTER of the original, not a RE-RECORDING. And it was done by a metal guy. It cleans up a lot of the muddiness of the original so the individual parts are more distinct. There is still a noticeable difference in the sound of tracks 4 & 5, but that is unavoidable due to the nature of the original recording. I don't know if I would go as far as to call this the ""definitive"" version of WoS, but I do like it better than the one in The Saint Collection and the re-recorded one. Maybe I've gotten used to the original sound, but I do think this might sound a little too clean (thus the 4-star instead of 5)."
2,Great Book on the Topic,The book is probably the best reference on the field. The authors take their utmost effort to explain even some of the most subtle details but in a unified theoretical fashion. Must buy for anyone interested in the Speech processing Area
1,Don't buy,"XACT is a dishonest company. They claim to have a warranty on their products, but there is literally NO WAY to get them to repair or replace a product. If you call their support number, you get an automated system with no option to talk to an operator. Instead, the system gives you an e-mail address. Then you have to e-mail them several times to get a response, and all they say is ""Send it back to the retailer,"" even after the 30 day return period.I bought theirXACT COMMUNICATIONS XG2500 Cordless Headset Telephonein late 2008 and it was of mediocre but acceptable quality at first. But then the battery life took a nosedive. A cordless phone that lasts ten minutes on a full charge isn't useful. And that happened during the one year warranty period. But I couldn't get a repair, replacement, or refund from the company. So my only recourse is to give out one-star reviews and warn others about the company."
4,Monster Slayer,"Good book. If you like true crime, this is an addition. I think more photos and material could have been added. Otherwise I feel it was a really good bargain. I can't complain because I purchased the book for a penny & you can't purchase anything for a penny."
3,16 pages of photo + Many filler pages = It's not bad.,"- This book contains 16 pages of photos. They show the killer, his accomplice, murder scenes, the detective and judge related to the case. This helps make it more interesting.- It graphically and vividly how cowardly the killer was. He begged the jury to spare his life when he brutally killed 4 victims without remorse.- It drags in many pages. For example, on 2 occasions, the author spent 6 pages or more talking about Native American folklore. He could have summarized them into one page each.- The wriring style is so so. It does not make the book interesting nor suspenseful."
2,not so good,"it started off good, but then the author just keeps repeating the crime scene and crimes over and over again only in different words... then the last half of the book is mostly the information on the trial, which once again repeated info on the crime scences... was not to impressed, was hoping for more."
4,Review of Economics in the Real World by Leonard Silk,"Easy to read and understand. Entertaining and interesting writing style with plenty of real world examples. These examples enable you to relate the economic concepts and terms used in the book, to what happens in everyday life. This gives a refreshingly practical emphasis to the subject of economics. Great reading for any student about to embark on a serious course in economics even though it is seriously dated today."
3,Suicide: The tradgedy of Hopelessness,Academic model based on a systems approach.A handbook for professional therapists. Not for the lay person. Not for someone trying to come to terms with a loved ones suicide.
3,iffy seller,"I'm giving 3 stars because I like the chain I received enough to keep. The seller loses 2 stars for bad customer service and inaccurate product description. I have received no communication from the seller - no order confirmation/shipping email and no response to my email. The chain I received was just under 4MM, not the 5MM described. I emailed the seller several days ago to ask if I received the wrong item - no response."
3,"Nice, but not what I ordered","The chain that arrived was lovely, but it was not the type that was ordered. And, I'm not taking the time to return it. Just won't order from here again."
3,Good but not great!,"Good product but it takes a really long time to find the satellite. If you run under a bridge, it loses you. Which is understandable. A bit on the big and bulky side as well. Between my IPOD, GPS, heart-rate monitor, watch, and data collection device, I feel like I'm going off to war. I wouldn't recommend this. I will buy an all in one next time."
4,Things You Need To Do,A very good program produced by KCET on How to Survive the Next Earthquake. Lots of what to do in this situation as well as what to do to PREPARE. Much of what they cover is good just for general emergencies and some prep stuff will apply to the present day concerns.
4,Good Songs,"They are good songs, but a previous reviewer was wrong. This is not the group that recorded Superman (Its not Easy). That was some other band. Bright Eyes are indie Emo, fronted by Conor Oberst, and he's really quite good. He performed 'When the President Talks to God' on Letterman in the summer of 2005, I think."
1,Elegant design but DOES NOT WORK FOR NP-FE1,"This is a very well-made charger with an elegant design and attachments for several types of batteries. However, despite the Digipower/Amazon description that it works for Sony NP-FE1 batteries, when it arrived I noticed that the Sony NP-FE1 is NOT listed on the package as a compatible battery. Undaunted, I opened the package, but when I tried to fit my NP-FE1 battery into the various charger attachments, it did not fit in any of them. False advertising!"
1,DigiPower TC-500S Travel Charger,This item was not at all useful for what I needed. I wanted an adapter/converter and the converter did not come with it. Did not use it at all and was told that if I did try to use this in Europe I would damage my cameras battery.
3,Airtight Case,"Lindsey Chamberlain, after being kidnaped, buried alive and then escaping makes her way into a town where she is treated and then released from the hospital with amnesia. A stranger tries to take her home claiming to be fiance`. Although she can't remember who she is or why she is there, she senses that this man is a danger to her.This opening leads to a second rescue and a quick return of her memory as she moves on to the archelogical dig in the Smokey Mountains. When she arrives the atmosphere is tense with none of the members of the team working well with the site director who seems to be totally unsuited for the job. The house occupied by the team is supposedly haunted which leads to further subplots.The dialogue was heavy and the numerous subplots were distracting. It took a long time to finally resolve a murder mystery."
4,The Elvis Empire uncovered,"ELVIS INC. is one-stop shopping for anything to do with Elvis and money. All but the first chapter deal with events after Elvis' death. Especially good are the sections on the estate's lawsuit against manager Parker in the early 1980s, and on the stratospheric rise of Graceland after near-bankruptcy in the two years after Elvis died. There is more detail in this book on these subjects than I have seen anywhere else. Toward the end I did feel that the book loses a little focus, and is not quite as pertinent as the first half. As, O'Neal goes off on some tangents, such as the marriage of Lisa Marie to Michael Jackson. To be fair, though, more recent events are just not as salient. But O'Neal keeps it always interesting. And I love that pink cover - groovy, man!"
4,Don't reformat your hard drive,"You do not have to reformat your hard drive to get rid of annoying programs that automatically run at startup. Formating your hard drive for that reason makes as much sense as tearing down and rebuilding your house to fix a squeaky door.(...)i own two media center notebooks and they emit a lot of heat. i recommend running any notebook with a cooler. i use bytecc. it is metal and inexpensive. do not buy a plastic cooler! to run a notebook without a cooler - you might as well set fire to it and get it over with. the new computer chips run so hot, you must add a cooling factor or you are burning up your investment."
3,Not really 200 stitch patterns,"I like the photos and overall look of the book. I felt cheated, however, because there are really only 94 stitch patterns. The rest are the same patterns using different yarns. To me, changing the yarn doesn't make it a new stitch pattern. It may qualify as a variation on a pattern but I think even that is pushing it. No one would make the cover piece from the lastest Vogue Knitting in a different yarn and say they made up a new pattern. I probably would have purchased this book anyway if the publisher had played straight with me and titled this book ""94 ripple stitch patterns"". At least then I would have known what I was paying for and I wouldn't feel as though the publishers pulled a fast one on me.As for accuracy, I've made only two of the crochet patterns and haven't found any errors in either one."
4,Crochet preference for myselff,"I saw a Granny ripple on an online blog, referencing the title, 200 Ripple Stitch Patterns. I was intrigued and ordered the book. I am not new to crochet, but I am somewhat advanced-newish to ripples and I find the ripple afghans charming. I love to match and compliment colors to my quilts and this gives me a nice reference to use for complimentary ""ripples"" too. I am more into crochet, but the knit pictures are nice too! I have more than one or two favorites, so the price was worth it to me to see these charmers on a bed or sofa! For those who love to ripple, I think this is inspiration waiting to happen."
5,Great book for beginners or for the experienced!,"Really loved this book. I have been knitting and crocheting for about 30 years and I still love the old standards. Maybe that's why I liked this book so much. It has a great variety of patterns with a knitted design and a crocheted design on each facing page. Many of the comments that I read here included the fact that some of the 200 patterns are just different color variations, but seeing how color changes the look of the pattern stitch is quite helpful. I would not hesitate to recommend this book to anyone who is an avid needleworker. Should be a ""must have"" reference book for any collection. It is beautifully laid out and illustrated with thumbnail pictures of each pattern included in the index."
3,Buyer Be Advised,"I bought this book a year or so ago thinking that I'd love to crochet and/or knit more ripple afghans. The problem is that there are many mistakes which in and of itself wouldn't be such a big problem if the publishers provided an errata page, which I've been unable to locate. Therefore, I've spent $16 and some cents for a book with mistakes and nowhere to find the corrections. I would advise potential buyers that purchasing this book may wind up being an exercise in disappointment, even though many of the patterns are lovely."
4,Nice collection,"This is a beautiful book, but I too was upset to discover that there are no where near 200 different patterns. The same pattern is counted as 2, sometimes 3 different ones when yarns are switched out or used in a different sequence. While this produces a slightly different look, the PATTERN remains the same. I have only tried a handful of the patterns, and so far have not encountered errata."
4,Ripple Delight,This book is beautifully presented. Most crochet stitches are fairly simple. The knitting stitches are more difficult & quite beautiful. This is a lovely addition to any crocheter's collection of knitting & crochet pattern books.
2,Sorry I bought this.,"Has beautiful stitches, but unfortunately there are plenty of errors, not in just one, but several of the patterns. Surely, there must be some corrections somewhere."
4,Wonderful pictures,"Honestly, I purchased this book because the cover is gorgeous. The book has about an even mix of crochet and knit ripple patterns. And it is more of a reference book than just afghan patterns.I haven't yet tried any of the patterns but I've spent lots of time thumbing thru admiring the photos. The photos and the color combinations are inspiring."
1,Don't waste your money,"This book is full of mitakes. I have tried about 20 patterns so far and all but one has had mistakes. There is no eratta online nor does the publishers website have anyway to contact them. Not to mention there are not 200 patterns, but the same patterns are done in different color yarns. This is a complete waste of money."
2,"Pretty Patterns, But.....","There are a few lovely ideas and patterns, and I'd buy the book, but only for the pictures and it were on sale for 50% or more off. I only recommend it to anyone who has the ability to really read a pattern well and rewrite a pattern to fix mistakes (Oh Boy are there a lot of mistakes in this one!) It's my habit to first write out any pattern I get from a book, so for me to do it with this wasn't too annoying, but I have to question what kind of follow-through was put into this to check for mistakes before printing. I've created a couple and they're fine. One more crochet book on my shelve won't hurt too much..."
1,A Big Disappointment,"I was very disappointed with this book, mainly because there are far fewer patterns than the title suggests. There are actually only 100 patterns for knitting (since I do not like to crochet, the 100 crochet patterns were irrelevant to me). In looking at many of the patterns, I realized that they were the same stitch patterns, but with different combinations of colors, which make them look different when they are not. I also have read other reviews that mention mistakes in the instructions, and although I have not found any of these yet, I find this inexcusable. I have been knitting for over 55 years, and I think the proliferation of knitting books (everyone wanting to climb onto the knitting bandwagon) has led to the production of some not-very useful books, this being one of them."
3,Wish it had stitch diagrams,"When I first received this book and looked through it I was thrilled with its contents. I like the layout and photos. The knitting stitch patterns appear on the left side of each page and the crochet stitch patterns are on the right side of each page. The photos of the stitch patterns are very well done, and each stitch pattern shows 2 different yarn and color examples, so you get a good idea of the possibilities for each one. My chief complaint is that, for the crochet patterns, stitch diagrams are not there. Stitch diagrams make understanding the patterns a whole lot easier. Providing both word descriptions and diagrams would have been enough to make me rate this a 5 star book. But without them, the book is a disappointment to me - someone who finds stitch diagrams a lot easier to follow than long word descriptions for crocheting."
2,Upsetting,"This book is very upsetting, contains numerous error's. Just my opinion, but had this been a recipe book, there would have been millions of response. Will be very careful, next time when purchasing knitting books, this is not the first time. Disturbing to have to waste yarn, as well as pull out most of the work, thinking you are the one in error."
5,200 Ripple Stitch Patterns,This book has an interesting way of presenting both crochet and knit patterns. With this system you can make any size you desire in your project.
4,THIS GAME IS SO AWSOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,THIS GAME IS SO GOOD! you can do sweet moves like doing a dunk from the free throw line and doing awsome rejections. the only downside is that the graphics stink. but everthing else is good. (it should be a 4.5)
2,Gym rat's father,"My 10 year old daughter begged for this for Christmas largely because of Dwayne Wade's picture on it (I think). It is a difficult game for younger children because the ""pros"" make every shot and the players miss everything so it is difficult to win against the computer. The NBA Street video games (especially Volume 2) are much more fun for the younger children."
1,Crap Attack,"Wow does that game suck or what? Not only are the graphics Nintendo 64 like but so are the controllers I can't believe I actually spend money on that crap and for the $30 it still feels like i was robbed. I really feel that EA should discontinue the Live series and focus their efforts on NBA Street...a true Basketball game. Some people might say ""Well, NBA Street ain't realistic"" but let's face it kobe missing an open jumper is also unrealistic and so are the way they make kwame brown look like he can actually dribble. The tattoos also suck thy look like something your friend might have drawn on himself while he was wasted...extremely wasted. And the sweatbands shouldn't look they are drawn on."
1,Huge disappointment and overly simplistic,"I was really looking forward to this book as a fan of some of his earlier books, especially five dysfunctions of a team, which is one of the most elegant frameworks i've seen on team dynamics.lencioni's solution to silos and politics? a shared goal with supporting objectives and metrics. it's a lot more complex than just that, and i'm surprised he didn't bring in some of his other work related to team dynamics and leadership, which must also be significant levers to help combat this problem.if you're looking to solve your problem with silos and politics within your own organization, keep looking..."
2,Not much here,I read a 200 page allegory to learn what was summarized in the last 25 pages. There is not much substance here and not much to indicate whether the method described in the book is proven.
3,Silos Politics & Turf Wars,"This book was well-written and lays out the problem very clearly. For those interested in finding a solution to the age-old problem of conflicts of interest caused by function-based departments, you may want to check out a book called ""Pyramids are Tombs"" that details how to design a professional service company to eliminate conflicts of interest and align people towards a common cause."
1,Weakest yet.,"I was so excited to see the this book at the store - we all know about silos, politics, and turf wars. Having read all of Lencioni's leadership fables, I couldn't wait to read this one.Such a disappointment! Lencioni spent more time writing about the conversations the lead character had with his wife about starting his consulting business than he did about how to tackle the Silos, Politics, and Turf wars. I couldn't find any solutions anywhere in this book.Would have given this zero stars if that was an option."
1,Fables are easy to write about,"Borrow the book from the library. Wasting your money on fables is not wise (unless you like wasting money). While entertaining, this is not worthy of a library collection item."
5,Brilliant and Well Told,This book provides solid practices and actions to identify and remove silos in organizations. It's filled with do-able actions in a context that gives examples and great team discussions.
3,low ROI,"It is a good story book and an easy read. If you are after dense useful information, you do not need to read the book. It might be better to get it from the library and reading the concept summary at the end of the book. The story is repetition of the concept through out the book in different organizational contexts."
4,Good but not his best work,I found this book to not offer as much insight as other works of lencioni. Overall a good read if you have silo problems
5,Excellent explanation of how to solve this pervasive problem,I have experienced the silos problem in many places and the explanations about the problem and the causes are spot on. The model that this book explains very well how to over eliminate the causes and overcome the problem. Managers should read this book.
4,"Silos, Politics and Turf Wars","Lencioni is in fine form, and both his consulting insights and writing talent flow together well. His points are timely, and in any organization larger than 15 or 20 people, on the mark. His articulation of the thematic goal concept has application not only in the for profit world in which he spends most of his time, but in the non-profit sector where I reside. The conversation about the theory at the conclusion of the fable cinched the learning. Well done indeed."
3,Interesting book,"This book is well-written. It is easy to read and keeps your interest in general, although it is sometimes a little repetitious and slow. I guess the author repeats the point to make sure you get it.Some of the author's ideas are new and thought-provoking, but you have to wade through some material which sounds like every other book on this topic, as well. In any case, if you are patient you will take away some neat new ideas that you will find yourself using and referring to.I like the examples and anecdotes he/she uses to illustrate his/her points - they are really interesting and I have found myself using the examples and referring to them in everyday conversations with people, which is great. I only wish that there were some more examples because it is not always easy to see the point when no example is offered."
1,Save your hard earned money!,"This is the first review I write because I wasted time (not a lot though..) on this book. The author is very succesful in dumming down a prevelant and very important issue. The book is written as if the target group is five year olds. The ""case studies"" will make a first grader cringe. I am at a loss to understand why books like this get published.The ""great abs in 4 weeks"" approach just doesn't work with a subject like this. I am afraid you got to take it more seriously and dig deeper."
4,Vege Coment,The blade doesn't lock in the position you put it in. You have to hold pressure on it. However it cuts extremely good and I will use it.
1,NOT like the older version!,"Blade is now stainless steel, & VERY dull! Had the older blue blade style years ago, that was wonderful...This one won't even cut a onionsam going to send it back!Also the postage for the item item was just about as much as the item!Very disappointed...Jacquelyn"
3,Not your mother's Feemster,"It's not the quality of my mother's slicer, that we as kids nicknamed ""the guillotine"". It's sharp enough to be risky with fingers, so I'm glad the ""pusher"" is included. the blade is black, not the gun-metal blue I remember from mother's and doesn't seem to be as thin and sharp. The thickness adjustment is a little ""iffy"". It's useable, but I doubt it will become a kitchen staple. Nostalgia reigns."
1,THE ORIGINAL FEEMSTER WAS GREAT - THIS MUST BE A KNOCKOFF,It's not sharp enough and doesn't do the job. It tears the vegetables rather than cutting them as I intended.
3,"Good Slicer, But Could Be Better","I used a slicer like this growing up, so I was excited to see the that they still made them. It works great, however, the blade won't stay straight. It always cuts crooked, unless I hold it with my finger. Frustrating, but it still works."
1,Native Vietnamese speaker trying to refresh vocabulary.,"Upon reciept of this book I started to scan throughly through the book and already noticed that it contained translations of its words which did not make sense. What was he thinking when he produced this dictionary. Nothing as common as a everyday word could be translated. He uses to many hard explanations for something that could have been so simple to define. I do not recommend this book if you are in the market to find a simple, yet easy to follow dictionary. This book would only confuse and frustrate you more instead of helping. I hope that this review can alert you ahead and maybe you can opt for something else on the market.Frustrated: SKP (Kentucky)"
1,defective out of the box,Bought this unit. It will not power up right out of the box. I would not suggest buying this item. I have read several other reviews stating the same thing. It appears this item has serious qaulity issues.
2,Another RCA Dog,This is my 2nd RCA DVD Recorder in 2 months. The first had issues with overheating and a broken fan (that was model DRC8060N). I returned that to Amazon as defective. Then I picked up the model DRC8052N at a local retailer. There's no fan on the 8052N but it doesn't run as hot as the 8060N...they must be two different animals inside. It Seemed OK at first then I tried to play DVD-R discs I'd burned on my PC and they would not play. They play in every other DVD player I've got. Their burned fine and in spec but the DRC8052N thinks they're blanks. DVD+R and DVD+RW played/recorded fine. Since I have a large library and stockpile of DVD-R the DRC8052N is also being returned to place of purchase.
1,Do Not Buy,"This recorder's power supply died and blew out my surge protector after 11 months. RCA would not repair it after that late date and asked me to send in $135.00 plus an estimated $16.95 UPS ground shipping fee as part of their exchange program. The customer representative was not aware of any service center in my area. I bought a new recorder for a lot less money, but have not repaired /scrapped this one for parts yet. The mono-tuner is pretty bad, so I did a Video-In in like the previous customers. The ability to play DIVX movies was great while it lasted."
1,Low quality machine,"Bought this machine about 2yrs ago. At 1st it looked like it was going to be a good purchase but after a few months I started to notice quirks in its operation. Like the tray not opening all the time. Also having to reboot it to get it to operate at all. I mean I worked with it. And all I got was 2 yrs after spending about 200 for it. I have had it with cheap electronics. So if this piece of crap is still around, RUN, don't walk THE OTHER WAY......"
1,terrible machine,"This is the worst piece of electronic equipment I have ever owned, and I have owned a lot! Never worked properly from day one. Unresponsive to both the remote and the buttons on the machine itself. Will not even turn off without being unplugged. When it does respond to commands from the remote, there is often a long delay before the response. never got it to record, and the DVD tray sticks EVERY time I try to use it. Possibly the most annoying device on the market."
1,RCA DRC 8052N,The unit I received was not working properly so returned it to the supplier who was very quick to get necessary information to me for the prepaid return.
1,Where to begin...,"A total lemon! This thing freezes up, the tray won't open most of the time, the power button broke (Have to use the remote to turn it on and off), the DVD's don't play well on other players, and the sound eventually cut out entirely.It worked adequately when I first bought it, but now a year later, it's completely unusable (And two weeks out of warranty).I'm never buying an RCA or Thompson product again."
2,Poor recording quality,The recording quality of this dvd recorder is poor. It doesn't upconvert but instead makes the video quality worse.
1,What a disappointment!,What a disappointment! The book was a bit tattered around the edges and I thought it might even be used. The vendor did a very poor job in packing the book (they used a simple envelope) and that was the cause of the damaged edges. I will NEVER use this vendor again. Sad Christmas gift.
5,I was born and raised in Baltimore and I loved the book.,"This is such a wonderful book and describes the area, culture and ethnic communities so well. The receipes are so simple yet so divine. I am giving it to a friend who is living in Houston where I also live who grew up in a suburb of Baltimore."
4,Munch Bunch series,"I was a member of a book club when I ordered these books for my children. (Who are grown now). I intended to use them for my grandchildren,but they've gone missing and I'd love to have another set. (I don't remember how many we had, but it was quite a few. HOw can I get a new set? Some of the titles are ""Billy Blackberry"" ""Emma Apple"" ""Pippa Pear"" There were mushrooms, cucumber, onion and other veggies in the series too. Please help me to find these wonderful childrens books."
3,Better than I thought,"It's a little on the poppy side but still pretty good.Not a lot of grit but there is a certain innocence to it that is appealing. If you like soul that sounds like it was aiming for a white audience, this is your stuff. Three and a half stars."
3,good bag,"this is a good, LARGE, sport bag. It makes a good travel bag but may be too large (with the backpack attached) for simple trips to the gym. The first bag i received did have some minor flaws, but i sent it back and received a perfect replacement. can't beat it for the price."
5,good tubes/reasonable price,"What can you say about an inner tube? Installed a month ago, and they are holding pressure nicely. I say OK."
1,Bad product,The tube started to leak in the second week. Was there any quality control? What can I say. It should not be sold.
1,these are terrible,I have bought 6 of these tubes for my bmx bike and they have all popped in a period of atleast 3 weeks they havent lasted and they are bad quality if you ride bmx.overall these are terrible.
1,Snake Oil,"I could bath in this product and not see any results, positive or negative. Science is true, this product is fake. Amazon forces me to give it a star"
2,working or not,This is working or not. i cant differentiate. I'm in the sales industry and my sales are still the same. cant recommend to a friend.
1,just water with alch.,"this is the worst scent i ever tried in my life. it remains for few seconds and disapears.it even has no smell, can you imagin ???????its really waste of money and time and not the item i was looking for.its absolutely just water and little alch. nothing elsei am really regreting bought it specially through Amazon !!!!!!!!i am really disappointed."
5,Works as Described..,"This mat works as described. Its pretty light and rolls up to a compact shape. Its 5/16"" or .3125"" thick so its not heavy duty but it does the job. I use this with a Schwinn 113 which I also bought from Amazon.This an excellent mat for exercise bikes. The bike does make small indentations on the mat but they go away once you take the bike off the mat. It seems to protect the floor underneath well as I cannot see any penetration from under the mat after using it with my exercise bike.I would recommend this mat to anyone using an average weight exercise bike."
2,This mat stinks and is a health hazard!,"This vinyl mat stinks and is a health hazard! I had it for almost a week and it was still off-gassing a vile odor. After an internet search, I learned that the odor was actually hazardous petro-chemical vapors (probably phthalate plasticizers). I returned it!"
3,NEED NEW RULER,"The mat is ok, rather soft...but don't expect it to be 5/16"". I would say 1/4 is a push.My mat is going on a soft foam floor, so I don't know if it will offer the protection I was hoping for. I am a bit surprised at the claim of thickness; they did however get the other size right! There are better mats, just want the customer to know it's a THIN MAT! It would be fine for many floors, just maybe not mine."
5,Equipment mat.,This is an excellent value for the price. It protects both carpets and floors from damage and gives extra traction for stabilizing your equipment when in use.
1,Java Style NOT!!!,"When I first read this book it was hard to keep an open mind. The author constantly compares Java with Small Talk. Unfortunately in keeping an open mind I over looked the bad coding style. This could have been an excellent book for beginner programmers that wanted to write professional code. However, the author writes code in the style of C++ and Small Talk. The author's code should not be used as a template, which is what most beginner programmers will do. Another problem with this book is that the author has made assumptions that all the techniques he has learned from other languages will work the same way in Java. This is not the case. While this book does contain some valuable techniques, I believe that the poor coding style and the author's lack of understanding of Java will mislead beginner programmers. Therefore I can only rate this book 1 star."
2,Not very good,Poor examples with lots of esoteric references. There are a lot better books out there - e.g. Exploring Java from O'Reilly
2,Stating the obvious,"Just about everything I've read so far just states the obvious. I don't disagree with anything that was said, but I think anybody who has written any OO code should know most of this already.I find myself saying ""duh"" a lot while reading this book."
2,My review,"It's called unthinkable but the ""unthinkable"" never happens. You never actually see any of the torture just screams. It was actually pretty tame. I dont think they went far enough. The acting was way over the top and seemed like a B movie. It makes me angry that the cop at first cares that he's being tortured. He's a freakin terrorist who cares how he feels. Torturing one life to save millions. Boo hoo. Like other people are saying the movie kinda falls apart at the end."
1,wow,"I agree: worst ending ever. I was expecting the director to at least take some kind of stand. But the ending is the worst kind of ending I could imagine for this movie.Also, I find torture really counterproductive. Given all historical precedent, it does not work, and just tarnishes those who use it. That having been said, if there was a terrorist who knew where a nuclear bomb was, and I had to choose between him being tortured for 20 minutes, hard, and 20 million people dying, I'd choose torture, and it would work, unlike in the movie."
4,Unthinkable,"This movie asks two good questions in our fight against terrorists. Are we willing to do whatever is necessary to protect our way of life? And doesn't a yes to tnat question make us terrorists as well? Can there be a line between what we should do or must do? Only 4 stars be,ause the screenplay falls short at the end. Sam is excellent as always, though."
2,WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO THE ENDING????????,"WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO THE ENDING!!!??? The DVD states that the alternate ending is included & IT IS NOT!! WFT!! I viewed this about 2 weeks before DVD release. A Solid 5 Star flick that stuck with me for several days. I just viewed the DVD, & the Incredible Ending which makes the whole thing come together was CUT OUT!!?? WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!! The TRUE ending to this masterpiece is the 4th bomb going off as the film ends. Without THE TRUE ending, showing the consequence of the final decision, the film is destroyed. This was the finest performance I've seen from Samuel L. (which is saying a lot). What a shame."
3,Good to the last 5,This movie was perfect until the last 5 minutes. There were so many ways it could have went that would have made it a top notch movie. The writer chose none of them and the movie seemed to end abruptly.
1,Weak Movie,"Talk about SaLOW, very slow, so slow that I could leave the theater have a beer come back and still watch the same argument. If you want to be put to sleep, its my duty to service this weak, slow boring movie. Who produced this???"
5,Five stars only because it's...,"...a logical extension of ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" as were sanctioned by Rumsfeld-Cheney-Bush and their Justice Department minions' legal ""torture memos"" after 9/11. I do not at all mean that as a partisan statement. I say only that the film is a logical extension of what was then. Other reviewers have dissected what they take to be directoral and other flaws in this movie. To be sure, this film is not for the squeamish. Let me just add that the most ""moral"" line in the whole thing is toward the end when the lead FBI character anguishly cries in preference to the proposed logical final unthinkable ""enhanced techniques"" step, ""...let the [eff]ing bomb go off!"""
4,Unthinkable.,"UnthinkableNow this is a really, thought provoking movie. What would you do to extract vital information from a captured terrorist who has planted atomic bombs in three, large, American cities? How far will you go to make him talk, with time running out and millions of lives hanging in the balance? What would be more importaint, obeying the laws regarding his civil rights or extracting the whereabouts of the bombs by any means ...immaginable? Watch the movie and you decide. I just did not like the ending."
2,Not my cup of tea...,"A terrorist manufactures and hides three nuclear bombs throughout the US, then allows himself to be captured. He gives the date and time for the bombs to go off, but no more. A mysterious interrogator known as ""H"" (Samuel Jackson) is brought in to find the locations of the bombs. An FBI counter-terrorism specialist (Carrie-Anne Moss) is a witness to the interrogation.The orders from on high regarding the interrogation? No holds barred. Find the bombs.Along with the screaming, the soul-searching, the missing fingers, the free dental work, and more, there is repeated reference to whether information obtained during torture has any validity. H doesn't care... he just ratchets things up as the terrorist (an ex-military US citizen) holds out.Is there anything H won't do? As the time gets closer to the deadline, is there anything people don't want him to do? And are there things he won't do unless ordered?Don't expect to feel good at the end of this film."
4,Unthinkable,Unthinkable is thinkable. Imagine you capture a terrorist who is an American citizen that worked on nuclear bombs. He threatens you that if you don't meet his demands he will blow up three devices planted across the US that could kill millions of people. Can you believe him? He has certainly had access. He may have motive based on his believe that the government agencies need to learn a lesson. Furthermore he seems dedicated to keeping their location secret no matter how he is tortured. Samuel Jackson plays the part of a covert torturer that is given free reign on the methods to extract the location of the bombs. Just how far will he go? How far would you go? Good quality DVD with commentary and standard extras. If you enjoyed this catchSwordfish.CA Luster
4,"Fine acting, provocative story","Only when the interrogator ""loses it"" and commits a act of horror, does this story stumble. Otherwise the actors, their performances and the story deserve widespread viewing. A lack of a brave ticket-buying audience probably caused the studio to send this to DVD. It should be seen by thoughtful people everywhere. Michael Sheen is an actor who continues to surprise."
4,Well Done,"I picked this movie because I didn't know much about it (which I like), Samuel J. was on the cover, and I thought the tittle was intriguing. This was a very good movie, a couple of nice twists and turns and good acting, nicely done."
4,How far would you go?,"Very well made film involving Terroism, Torture and how far you would go to stop someone from taking Innocent lives. Kill the few to save the many? That is the basic question here. Samuel L. Jackson is very good in this. I recommend watching this film. Really makes you think and question your own Convictions."
4,"Disturbing, thought provoking, great piece of work","This was a movie that was engrossing and engaging. It was very well acted and directed. It was also quite disturbing to watch and at the same time extremely interesting. After watching the movie, my wife and I talked about it intensely for several hours before turning in for the night and then again when we got up in the morning! Very thought provoking. Neither of us wants to have the responsibility for needing to get information that is critical to the lives of millions of people. This was so well done as to show you that the positions you might take are not that simple given extreme circumstances. Well worth the watch."
1,Whack!,This was not a good movie. Trying to convince a terrorist to disclose the whereabouts of bombs is not good movie making theme.
1,A waste of my American money!,"Great actors, lousy theme and direction, with little or no creativity or logic...tasteless according to entertainment.Terrible end...was there even an end????Pinkie"
1,We Are Worse Than The Terrorists!,"I'm ashamed of my country after watching this film. How could we have created something so didactic, so heavy-handed, so phony from the first minute to the last? Blech."
3,Unthinkable,This film worth the rental fee that's about it! Save the money on owning; when you should be spending just a buck. After watching this movie you can return it without feeling high & dry.
4,"THOUGHT PROVOKING, UNLIKE MOST HOLLYWOOD PICTURES","Squeamish types may be turned off by the excessive violence in this picture. It centers around a terrorist negotiator, Samuel Jackson, brought in to break a Muslim terrorist who knows the location of nukes placed in the USA.He's countered by a righteous FBI agent, played by Carrie-Anne Moss, who balks at the extreme torture methods. The clock is ticking so it creates a nice pressure cooker feel but the moral questions are the true focus of this picture. Are we willing to destroy our ideals for self preservation? Does the end justify the means? Do we not torture the terrorist, let the bomb off and let millions upon millions of people die? The villain, played by Mike Sheen, does a good job portraying the Muslim perspective of how Americans have trounced on his country. The extended version ending is better than the original. CHARACTER/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B plus; QUESTIONS: B plus to A minus; MY GRADE: B plus; WHEN WATCHED: yesterday."
2,disagree with others,i thought it was poor. good actors but it was really obvious and had very little plot other than to focus on the torture itself.
4,"A little short, but still worth it","I would give this cd 4 and 3/4 stars if it were possible. It was just a little short for a best of cd. This is the way dancehall reggae should sound, even today."
4,Thoughtful Overview,"If you have ever wondered if there is a democratic future in countries declared to be Islamic, this book is good food for thought. Starting with a thoughtful discussion of different possible definitions of democracy, Eposito then reviews the history of six Islamic countries to review the record. The book is well written, and also a good primer for the political history of those countries; living in one of them, I feel the treatment was fair. Eposito leaves me wondering, ""what next?"", but this is perhaps because it is hard to determine, based on the cases, what may actually be the final end of Islamic democracy."
5,kick ass!,"this album was the best ""new music"" i bought in 2010! i listened to it for 2 weeks straight! now it shuffles in my ipod collection and i still love it!a must have if you like 70's soul funk! awesome! highly recomended!"
3,"Taste fine, but no help for queasiness","To me these are just like normal sugar free candies. They taste decent, but I didn't notice any help with queasiness and they aren't even super sour, which sometimes helps with nausea. I tried them a few times, but they did nothing to help me feel better. I love the idea of candy that would help with my upset stomach. I wish they had worked."
2,No pillow included,"From the description, I believed that this product included a blanket and a pillow (the dimensions of the pillow were given). When I received the product, there was no pillow. The folded blanket inside of the zippered pouch formed the pillow. Why would one want either a pillow or a blanket? Description was confusing. Also, the product was not enclosed in any type of package such as plastic wrap, only folded in the shipping box. I was somewhat disappointed and sent the product back for a refund."
5,Great entertainment for Old Hollywood Addicts,"This DVD gives you the stuff they cut from the originalproductions...Its the clips they threw out...Sometimesfor the sake of running time for a picture, others becausethey were just not up to studio standards... If you get thistitle, then you must also purchase part2... They should havebeen a boxed set...This was a Turner release and originallyaired on the Turner Network... So buy both, and get out themicrowave popcorn... You are in for a rare romp!"
3,Hi,"This is pretty good but it has a lot of prolems they should improve. 1.The sound just ... its way too loud when you're trying to stay hidden and it's too loud when you fire it. 2.The shape is just stupid. It's like they just through something together in 2 seconds.They should make ones that look more like real guns. Although they do have to worry about wierd parents that blame toy guns, video games, and movies for all the violence in the world to escape the fact that they're just not doing a good enough job on monitering them. 3.It's not durable. I had some that wore out in only 2 years, and i wasn't even being rough with them."
5,Super lazer,this game is relly cool but you can not see the lazer but its still fun. your gun keeps beeping while its on so the players can tell where each other are. its a very fun thing
3,This is cool,"When I got these I had a lot of fun with them. I didn't like playing indoors with them though because the ""laser"" would bounce off and hit me. Also if you are playing with any laser challenge vest I recommend buying a back vest to play. What people will do is they will cover their vest and be almost invincible. This is fun with about 4 people. If you're going to play with more people I recommend getting the laser challenge 2000, or the Radar extreme so you can use the extra guns and use the game system hookup. If you're a beginner get these and if you're going to have more people buy the better ones."
4,Great River Road,"At first I didn't much like this CD. You see, I received it the day after receiving Trusting The Angels, which is now my all time favorite Upton CD. This one, for me, doesn't compare. However, this has REALLY grown on me and a few of the tracks get played in heavy rotation."
5,Excellent piece of work!!,"I would definitely give this book its 5 deserved stars. I have a considerable collection of text books on the subject, and so far I have not read another so concise, easy to read and digest, entertained (the author constantly adds cracks to the story) and superbly written piece of work on US International Taxation. I definitely recommend this book regardless of whether you are in school or in practice. It comes short on very specific detail, but then again, there's when your larger books come in."
4,A clear primer on international tax,I read this book for a class on financial law. Isenberg's book stood out from many of the other texts by proving quite read-able. He is almost funny at times. The content too is clear (insofar as international tax can be). It's an excellent primer for someone already versed in the basics of tax lax and finance.
5,Simply a Great Book,What a delight it is to read a book that simplifies the areana of international taxation. The author has written a book that is easy to digest and actually makes the topic interesting with practical examples. This book is well worth the purchase price. Well done!
5,Laredo: Season 2 Part1,"I highly recommend this product. It's very entertaining with some good humor. Most everyone can ride their horses really well and there are good stunts, some I'm sure done by the actors themselves. No horses are being tripped with wires, like you see in some of the old westerns. My only problem is Peter Brown does not do a southern accent very well. I guess that's because he's from New York. They don't have anything like this on television anymore."
3,"Good Story, Adolescent Level Writing","This was my first Robin Alexander read and I was slightly disappointed. The story itself is very good -- Claire Murray, a travel manager, moves from Houston to Baton Rouge and befriends the enigmatic Tristan Dellacroix. Claire is running from a stalker in Houston. Tristan is suffering from low self esteem fostered by a harsh mother. Their relationship develops, until Claire discovers a secret that may ultimately tear them apart.I can't get into too many details without giving away the punchline. However, as good as the premise of this book is, the writing is at an eighth-grade level at best. The dialogue is verbose and repetitive. Although the characters have depth and dimensionality, they are incredibly immature and unbelievable.I have Alexander's other book, 'Gloria's Inn,' on my shelf. Because of the lackluster quality of writing in 'Murky Waters,' it will be a long time before I will get motivated to read it."
3,Good book!Suspenseful and romantic..,"I liked this book a lot and read it in 1 day and I loved Claire and Tristan's relationship and how you get to really know them as characters.I loved Tristan,she was so cool up until I found out her secret and then I still finished the book but I didn't like Tristan very much after that and I don't know if I would have did what Claire does but I understand it.I wil probably get another Robin Alexander book,though."
4,Film d' epoque.,"A good cast and an interesting script have good possibilities to have as result a good film. You have to watch this film concidering that is a film of the 60s. Is not bad but we have seen J.L. Tredigniand in better films. The unrated version is supposed to be uncut...he , he, ..i don't think so!The version i have seen some 25 years ago in my neighbourhood's cinema was somehow more daring.."
5,"Little appreciated at time, wears well with age.","A comedy with the theme that everyone is entitled to their own perversions, so long as ""no one scares the horses."" Trintignant plays a mildly befuddled medical school professor, and Spaak is a youthful and appealing widow who learns more and more about the secret life her recently deceased husband led on the side. She is not outraged by his perversions, only hurt that he did not think she would join in them. And, she sets out to discover what he found so exciting about them. Compare this comedic approach to sex with the dour, serious Swedish ""I Am Curious Yellow"" of the same period."
2,Comprehensive but too technical for average consumer,"I could not read the entire content as I was too bored. So I looked for some specific information I was interested in. Explanation was thorough but no specific conclusions in any of them I looked at. I have read about electronic magnetic fields before but for a casual student, this is not the right book in my opinion."
1,Lack of Citations,"Unfortunately it lacks authority. There are no citations and all we get are phrases such as ""scientists are becoming concerned"", people believe"" and so on. What people think or believe is not important, what matters is empirical research and this author refers to none. It consists entirely of largely unattributed opinion. Every word of it may be true, but it could equally be a collection of imaginative musings. This book was given to me as essential information, but my scientific opinion is that it is superficially interesting but of little use."
2,it's just another a regular product,"it works well, but not as good as I expected, and it doesn't have a paper tray to receive faxed sheets. The only advantage over my older one is that its smaller."
4,solitary druid,"it has helped me to form my personel cerimonies since yhere is no grove near me only wiccan peoples , whom didn't make me feel welcome at an event of thiers."
3,All clear on the Salisbury Plain,"I liked ""Solitary Druid,"" I felt empowered to go ahead and work the path without asking permission from control freaks in robes. Speaking of control freaks in robes, the author goes a little too far with the idea that, of course eventually, you'll want to join a club and here's the contact information. I thought that was lame. Solitary path working is legitimate; if I ever decide to join a club, I'll go shopping for another book."
3,"Some good information, but not extremely organized. . .","I did enjoy this books section on the Druid holidays and ritual. Although the ritual format is a tad dry, it gives many solitary practitioner's a starting point, which I'm sure was the author's intention. The reason I give it only three stars is because the rest of the book was laid out and organized kind of poorly, and I didn't walk away from this book with a huge amount of new information. It also covers only the ADF perspective, which is one of many. I would recommend reading it though, if you are interested in ADF style Druidry."
3,Not for the beginning Druid researcher,"I found this book to be quite narrow in its perspective of Druidry, and if I was new to the study of the Druid path, I think it might have even turned me away. I feel that Ellison promotes his style of practice as a doctrine - that this is ""the best"" way to do everything. I also found his presentation of historic Celtic lifestyles, such as homosexuality and polyamory to be interesting, but inappropriately placed at the very beginning of the book. I am not new to these lifestyles by any means, but it almost gave a feeling like he was recruiting/promoting them. I don't think of the ADF as a sex cult, but presenting this as early as he did, with several links included, made me wonder.If you are looking for an entry-level book on the modern revival druid movement, I think you would gain more unbiased information in a more readable format from Greer's ""The Druidry Handbook"".Many blessings on your quest."
5,love the book,"If you have an interest in yoga and Tantra, I can recommend this book. Still reading, and given the depth of the material, I will be for a while, but Dr Frawley has done an awesome job of presenting what could be very daunting subject matter. Highly recommended."
3,A disorganised discussion of WW 1,"First and foremost, this is NOT a historical review of the facts and events surrounding WW 1. There is more attention given to poetry and art from the period than the actual conflict. The naval and air wars are barely mentioned. On the other hand, there are lots of great pictures and the stories themselves are interesting, if a little disorganised."
2,A long-winded poorly done overview of the war,"This book was quite disappointing. Granted, I was not expecting to see a definitive history, but it seems every mediocre poet made it into the book. Yet Flanders Fieldsm arguably the most well-known poem, does not make the cut.The book talks about a 19th century war with 20th century weapons but ignores discussing the weapons, poison gas, tanks, barbed wire, airplanes. Few maps either.Very disappointing."
5,Worth its weight in gold,"Several years ago I was asked to teach a class on doctrine at my church. I had read Dr. Cottrell's excellent commentary on Romans, and I went searching to see what books he may have written on theology in general. I was delighted to find that he had just published The Faith Once for All. I bought a copy and was not disappointed. It was an excellent resource in preparing my lessons, and I have found it a valuable reference work ever since. Last year my men's small group studied through it cover to cover. It prompted great discussions every week, and all of the guys in the group gave it rave reviews."
5,Murder at 1600,This is an excellent movie. The suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat because you just think you know what is going to happen and it ends up being something else. The acting is great. I love Snipes & Ladd in these roles. They are really good together. I think most people would love to watch this movie. It's a very good story line and is very believable. It is great intertainment.
2,popcorn movie,The only reason I saw this movie was because Alan Alda was in it.The cast was good but give me a break Alan got a bad part he should have been a main chractor.
2,Even Though I'm A Sucker For President Movies,"The film starts out with a ridiculous scene involving a suicide that Wesley saves by cold cocking, and the film never gets any less absurd. As contrived thrillers go, this one was pure Hollywood, complete with dopey plot twists that make less sense the more you think about them. Plodding, pointless and pedestrian, Murder At 1600 is so dull it actually put me to sleep twice, I finally did finish it, though I admit that I fast-forwarded through the tedious fight scenes at the end, will Wesley die? Snipes mugs through the whole film, with then trendy cigar conspicuously in place. Even Dennis Miller was dull. You really don't need to see this flick, although I was amused when Wesley read the big bad guy his rights while in handcuffs."
3,"Alda gets to show a different side of ""Hawkeye""","Any movie that allows former-M*A*S*H star Alan Alda to play against type is worth a look.Star Snipes adds another ""action role"" to his ever-expanding arsenal of ""kick butt"" types. Diane Lane, Ronny Cox, and Daniel Benzali supply enough backing to make this thriller passable.The appearance of Diane Baker as the President's wife makes the movie work for me."
1,A big no-no,"OK, there are times you want to relax by watching something easy and entertaining, so you go for a movie with a bit of this'n'that: action, violence, humor, romance. This was my premise when choosing this movie. I was hoping for very uncomplicated fun, with some mystery, action, intrigue, romance, etc. Let's face it, we might love gourmet cuisine, but every once in a while a hotdog sounds really good. Well, this hotdog was a real dog. Sure, this is a straightforward movie, with an easy to follow plot, and with many of the ingredients listed above, but the end result was bad. Wesley Snipes is such a talented actor, and somehow he gets these roles where he is a thuggy good guy, decent but not very bright, getting in trouble (as usual). Alan Alda was disappointing as the National Security Advisor. The only refreshing character was Dennis Miller almost playing himself. But in summary, this movie was way too lame and predictable, better left on the shelves."
1,No.,"The script is manifestly techically inaccurate. A D.C. cop cannot investigate a homicide on federal property. That is the job of the FBI, plus there are at least six more gross errors in this film. With the kind of money they spent making this film, you'd think they could hire some high school kid to google the facts and get them right.By pass this DVD, unless you want to rent it just to see Diane Lane."
2,Identity crisis leaves Murder at 1600 unsolvable mess,"Murder at 1600 is an unsolvable mess that suffers from a severe identity crisis. It starts out with the murder of a White House staffer and ends up with everyday cop Wesley Snipes and his Secret Service counterpart Diane Lane trying save the nation from a constitutional crisis. Therein lies the problem with Murder at 1600: it is really two not very good movies in one. The first half is rather ho-hum, but is still believable; Snipes wades through bureaucratic bull while investigating the death of a White House intern. The second half is pure fantasy, livened up with shoot'um up action, as the trail of crumbs leads to an incredibly dumb conclusion. If the producers of Murder at 1600 could have decided which direction to go, they would have had an average, but entertaining movie. Instead, we get a movie that is average and not entertaining."
3,Three and a half stars.,Formulaic at times--Snipes has limited range--but Diane Lane is great and the movie tells an ultimately engrossing story. Ends well.
4,Exciting. Thrilling. Do you know what you think you do? Pay attention.,"Highly entertaining, frightening and thrilling, this film keeps you wondering if you know what you think you know. Pay attention and notice all the details. Good film. Definitely recommend."
5,Can you say AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!,"It's a cop flick with WESLEY SNIPES, can it get any better! *sigh* Seriously though....normally i roll my eyes when I see that my mom got ANOTHER cop flick but when I watched this I realized that it wasn't just another cop flick, it was exciting, thrilling, and definitely #1 on my best cop flick list. I encourage you to if not buy this movie then at least watch it. You won't be disappointed! (WARNING: this is my opinion, this comment doesn't guarantee absolute satisfaction or any other such thing!)"
3,Could This Happen,"A murder in the White House? Could this really happen? Today, I guess, just about anything can happen. Who knows what people with ""agendas"" are capable of doing.Wesley Snipes is on the D.C. police force and is called in to investigate a murder at the White House. Diane Lane is on the White House Secret Service detail and the two together work to solve ""who done it"".This was a very good suspense movie, well acted by all the cast. The blending of Wesley Snipes and Diane Lane as a team was very interesting."
5,"Good movie. Great picture quality, Great Sound quality","The story about a DC cop (Snipes) investigates murder of a young woman in the White House. Everybody is a suspect including the President and his son. The story is quite good and Dwight Little direction keeps the film interesting all the way. The DVD sound and picture quality is very good. This movie also features my favorite actress, Diane Lane. She is so good in the role of Secret service. I am so disappointed she was not even considered to replace Jodie Foster in the sequel of Silence of the lamb (Julianne Moore got the part). The producer should have seen this movie before made the decision. Anyway it is a great entertaining DVD to be added to your collection. You won't be sorry."
3,Sleezeball Alan Alda?,"Another White House murder, like Absolute Power. The president's son's girlfriend is murdered. Cagy Alan Alda, no longer a lovable Mash doctor, gets the president to agree to resign in order to save his son from prosecution. (Huh?) Law enforcement agent Wesley Snipes suspects that the president's son is innocent. Happy ending, if predictable."
2,"Same, same no different!","This movie is quite good, it has its moments. However this has been made before. The plot goes something like this: President and a murder and one suspect! The good part is that its fairly easy to watch, you dont have to concentrate 100% to follow the plot (U have seen it before, right!) Suitable for a rainy Sunday afternoon!Replay value: Medium"
4,review for Murder at 1600,"This movie was actually a gift for my father. He really liked it a lot, and said he would watch it over and over again."
3,editing updates,"since my last review, I have written to Bonnie Scott and she has contacted the publishers to correct errors. So it's getting better."
5,Great product,This is a well made durable product. I use it with Elgato Video Capture. Video quality is excellent. Connections are very solid
5,extend my Directv to a computer monitor,"I use this cable to give me a TV display on a spare LCD panel in my office. I ran the cable from my Directv box in a nearby room. I have to go to the other room to switch channels, but I don't tend to channel surf much.The video and sound are fine."
5,Charming,"Wow, this is a very personal poetry collection. There is such a varied range of style and theme however. You can feel it as your own, the passionate love, the unrequited love, the longing, the passion and the search for truth. Very moving. I love this verse:"" Sentiment of greyAs the fool that falls twiceTo the same unrequited flameAnd has but silence to say""Haven't we all been there ?"
3,NO Extras on DTS version?,"The show is great and DVD sound and picture are great. But, I noticed my DVD has no Extras (the interviews with Aramaki's voice actor andthe composer) even though the box says it is supposed to. Also, the DVD does not have 5.1 sound even though the box claims it does. Did I just get an old DVD in a new box? Maybe it was sitting int the warehouse for a long time? Series is worth having on DVD if you can afford it****Did anyone else experience the NO EXTRAS problem?****Thanks"
4,Anime to make you think,This is definitely thinking people's anime. GitS masterfully incorporates rich animation with a fast paced and deeply interwoven plot line. Watching the episodes as presented on the DVD helps to pull the storyline together and is well suited for those who wish to become acquainted with the series.I really enjoy this particular animation style and the dialogue goes a long way to keep watchers hooked. I would recommend this to people who are looking for a show with diverse characters and a topical story line. You'll be through this episodes quickly enough to want to continue the rest of the volumes.
5,"Smart, Elegant and Honest","If you're looking for sensible, honest, well-researched insight as to why the American prison system fails to rehabilitate, you could not ask for a better book than this one. Mr. Soering steers wide of the blame game and focuses on various types of prisoners, their backgrounds, the laws that keep them incarcerated, the reasons for those laws and why many current laws and policies do more harm than good. As State, Federal and Local govenments struggle to find funds, ENORMOUS amounts of money are being poured into a system that is making our society more dangerous, not less. This is an intelligent, timely and important book that needs to be read by every single person involved in law enforcement, education and social work - and any person interested in understanding prisons from a real world perspective."
4,Excellent book,"This is an excellent little book, easy to read and should be required reading for anybody working with youth or in the criminal justice system. Although it is American, it rings true for Australia and other western countries who are increasingly getting tough on crime. It is interesting that the people who actually visit prisoners while they are incarcerated are usually of the opinion that the prison culture makes people worse, not better. Punishment and rejection never made a human being more loving.Jens Soering writes passionately about what he knows only too well."
3,Ok only bought it for one song,"Ok cd, just bought it for one song. The rest are ok but not something I would run out and get. Just could not find a site to download (legally) the one song."
1,The entire CD skips,"I love the music on this CD, but the entire CD skips. It is a very bad product. now I will have to purchase another one from somewhere. This sucks!!!!!"
1,I didn't like this book,"I picked up this book hoping I could learn about what happened at Ground Zero. I tried to follow the book but at times I got confused as it's hard to keep all the facts clear. Also, I got confused about what the Scientologists were doing some of the time."
1,Failed to Hold my Interest,"While I am interested in learning about other's experiences at Ground Zero, I found myself being confused by the disparate accounts of Ms. McIntyre's volunteer experiences that she offers in this book. Also, I with she had talked about her encounters with the rescue workers instead of focusing on her experiencs with fellow Scientologists and other celebrities she met."
1,Vague recollections,"As I was unaware of the work that Julie McIntyre and other Scientologist Volunteer Ministers peformed at Ground Zero, I picked up this book hoping to gain some insights at to their work in the recovery effort. However, I was disappointed as I had hopes that Julie would have included more detailed information about her experiences. Also, sometimes she gives information in one chapter that contradicts material she furnishes later on."
1,Waste of time,This box was designed to part you from your money. The author is not experienced in stress management and has no credentials.
4,Tapioca rolls a hit!,My children much prefer the tapioca rolls to the tapioca bread for sandwiches and burgers. They don't get soggy as quickly in the lunch pail (especially if toasted first) and seem to taste better.
4,"Great rolls, poor shipping","We keep a gluten free household, and use these rolls frequently. Toasted for breakfast or sandwiches, or microwaved as a dinner roll with supper. They travel well, and are handy to always have around.Unfortunately, a few of my deliveries from Amazon have arrived with one or more 6-packs already full of mold, and foods are not returnable."
5,Great Gluten Free Roll!,"I was introduced to this product at Disney World... and was in heaven. If you heat it up for 10 minutes in the oven, it gets a nice crust... be careful though, it can burn if in too long. Upon opening, I put them in a ziploc bag and leave them on the counter. They have remained good for 3 weeks at minimum - I eat them pretty quickly. Can't say enough good stuff about this roll!"
4,unusual and fun,"This was my first Katie Macalester and won't be my last. I like smart romances that don't drown me with drippy sentiment, and they must have plenty of plot and snappy dialogue. One of my favorite lines from this book: ""I don't often find naked men slowly bleeding to death in the basements of haunted inns."" The sex is explicit here, which is not my personal preference (there is a fine line between turn-on and turn-off, and this book occasionally crossed it for me) but the charm and humor of the rest of the story were perfect. A fun read!"
4,Great fun,This was great fun. I really enjoy this author and am purchasing the other books in this series.
5,Wonderful exactaly what you would expect from Katie!,"This book is just amazing there is no other way to put it! katie realy hits her mark with this book. Its fun, Funny, sexy, has alot of action, and adventure. It is paranormal all the way through! All Kitie Fans and Vampire fans will love this book it is an awsom read!"
2,Not Very Good,"I purchased this book strictly on the recommendations from other Amazon readers. I was looking for a romance story with a fun, vampiric element. I did get the vampiric element, but I found the humour to be a bit underdeveloped and at times very childish. I think there were only three or four parts where I laughed out loud.Plus, romance books based strictly in the first person are confusing and difficult at best. I have only read two to date that are worthy.I have the sequel to this book, and deep inside I am hoping it offers more then this first one did. Interestingly, the author gives thanks to Christine Feehan whose Dark series are the hottest vampire romances on the market. And, although CF's books have been lacking of late, please don't look to this book to offset what you haven't been recieving in a Feehan book.If you are looking for fun vampire romance in the first person then I suggest Mary Janice Davidson's ""Undead and Unwed"". That book is absolutely hilarious."
1,i had to stop reading,"i purchased this book based on the good reviews it got and was completely disappointed! the heroine is annoying, her vampire is dull - i stopped reading half way because it kept putting me to sleep, literally!if katie macalister was going for fun romp, she needs to take some lessons from mary janice davidson - 'undead and unwed' or 'undead and unemployed'. even linsay sands does a better job in 'single white vampire', 'love bites' and 'tall dark & hungry'.or, for a more dark read, try emma holly in 'catching midnight' and 'hunting midnight. i enjoyed these most of all. hope this helps!"
1,Not worth the paper its printed on.,"While I adore most any vampire fiction out there, this book is (sadly) not worth the paper its printed on."
5,How much do you love Christian?,"I agree with some other reviews that the first book in the series was just ok. But the character of Christian was intriguing so I went on to read his story. Oh, and it was wonderful. Really funny, very sexy, and just an entertaining read. I loved Christian and Allegra, and the ghosts were hilarious. The cat ghost is one of the clever touches I've come to expect from one of my favorite authors. This is a great series. Don't let the slow start of book #1 stop you. It gets really good from here on out."
3,Felt silly after buying it,"I bought this travel charger together with the SD800 camera. It does work fine, so far. But the Canon instructions make explicit that their included charger, which is *much* more compact, can accept a range of voltages using any standard travel converter/adapter. If you have such a plug adapter anyway, then it turns out this travel charger is superfluous. If you don't already have one, you can get one for less than this thing costs, have the added benefit of a converter for other items (hairdryer, whatever) and still save on bulk when you travel compared to this awkward hunk of plastic.The packaging is the bonded plastic stuff that can't easily be opened without either getting injured or swearing, or both."
4,Perfectly Adequate Replacement For A Lot Less Than Canon's Price,Mine came with the adapter for NB5l (as well as the other mentioned adapters). It works as well as the original Canon. The only shortcoming is that it is thicker than the Canon original.
2,Everything that everyone else said,"Pretty much theres nothing good you can say about this game. Everything that people have been posting has been true and more. The gameplay is awful, I guarantee you could play a half and point out at least 15 major problems. Also, if you're fantasy drafting a team why can't you get out before you have to watch the entire draft, hire a coaching staff, and go through training camp? Also, why is it that if you finish a season your young players are more likely to lose freestyle controls than gain them. I just had a team with dwight howard and andre iguodala and they improved in every category, howard lost his power and iguodala lost his outside stopper, what is the point of this? And whoever thought of the PDA idea should be shot. We all need to boycott future NBA Lives until EA Sports decides they want to make a quality game. That or bring back NBA jam, that game was sweet."
2,Where Has The Fun Gone?,"I have only been playing NBA Live since 2003 but I must admit that 2003 & 2004 are the best looking games they have made. Superior graphics, moves, complaining to the refs and more made these games very entertaining. In 2004 your created players had faces that moved on and off the court, award ceremonies, stat screens and now for 2006 just this sour mugshot killer looking face appears representing your player. It seems that EA games is just trying to make a buck, this is the last game that I will buy. Save your money, buy a used copy or rent it."
2,TOOO EASY!!!!!!,"this game is way too easy offensivly. Wat happened to that defense nba live 2005 had last year. Good defense makes the game more exciting, not crazy free flowing offense especially in a game of two top defensive teams."
3,Its an ok Game!!!!!!!!!!,This game is ok not better than 2k6 but still pritty good. I highly recommand 2k6 and this game rent it and if u liked it u can buy it but the CPU takes over the game.
2,NBA Live 04 & 05 are better,this game isnt good at all... there isnt any defrent from last years. the grapichs the trailer and the comericals look way better than wat they really look like.. if u a big time NBA fan go ahead and get it it but i suggest renting it first
3,New Features...Yet Still the Same Problems,"Do you want a true basketball simulation instead of a game where the CPU predetermines when it'll take over regardless of what team u play as and how ""smart"" you seem to play? Then ditch Live and get 2k6. This is my first time playing 2k6...meaning I have been playing Live for a quite a while. I bought Live 06 and took it back for a refund the next day. Even though Live 06 has new features, they still retain major problems of 05. Their heads are like cabbage patch dolls and all players seem to ""skate"" across court. In Live 06 and in Live 05, it didn't matter whether u played smart or not...the CPU usually took over towards the end of the game and you'd be lucky to even win by 5 points or less.and didn't you know that Live 06 for xbox 360 and ps3 WONT have Dynasty or slam dunk contest? It's their crappy marketing scheme to allow them to say for Live 07.....""NEW FEATURES...DYNASTY MODE and SLAM DUNK!!!!""...HAHAHA"
3,No NBA 2K6,Ever since I picked up my first NBA series games which was NBA 2K3 I have never played an NBA Live game since. NBA Live characters just don't seem to have the realistics as NBA 2K6 does. Here are my comparisons of NBA 2K6 to NBA Live 2006Reading other reviews on this game it looks like NBA 2K6 added all the features that Live was missing. Still no profile picture though which would be nice and since there is the EYE TOY now also I do think you should be able to take a picture of your own face and put it on your created player. I would not spend money on an NBA LIVE game.
2,An excellent reviewer,This game is very average. I have gotten every EA Sports game for the past 5 years. I have always been happy except for the NBA series which i felt has been the same year after year. So instead of shelling out 40 bucks this year to buy the game i rented it hoping for something good. It was average exactly like the 05 version. I decided not to buy it. I read all the reviews and NBA 2k6 seemed like it was great game. I went out and bought it for 25 bucks and boy am i happy. It is 10x better the Live with better graphics and presentation. It is extremly realistic. Buy IT Not NBA LIVE
5,"Great game, best ""NBA Live"" for some time.","This game is a truly fantastic. Especially the graphics, they have a very significant improvement from last year (NBA Live 2005). For the game play, it is pretty good like before you can slam dunk or something like that. Like usual, you can play through the whole season (regular season, playoff/post season, East, West final and most importantly, NBA Finals) including the NBA all-stars week which is very important in this game. Since last year, they add the slam dunk and the Rookies vs. Sophomores in the NBA all-star week. This time is no exceptions. And of course, the most important game- NBA all stars game between East and West. Overall, this game is truly fantastic. Buy it or you will regret it."
1,HATED IT,i own nba live 03 and it is 100 times better than nba live 06 because of the horible grafics in nba live 06. ps1 games have better grafics! here is my advice to youDO NOT BUY THE GAME
2,this game sucks,"just read through the reviews and you will learn all you need to about this game (aside from every 6th or 7th person who says its the best game ever made). defensive abilities are very limited. you can pretty much score at will from 15 feet or closer to the basket. mediocre players on other teams will torch you for 40 plus points. game play absolutely sucks, the set up of the dynasty mode sucks. the music and the announcers suck. don't buy this game."
2,They get worse every year,"EA sports are going in reverse. The 99 version on playstation one was better. The graphics on this one haven't improved for 5 years, the camera angles aren't helpful and gameplay is unrealistic. I still own the playstation version from years ago and would rather play that. At least until a worthy substitute comes along. The only positive of this one is the career mode."
2,Disappointing,"Strapless is easy to read but contains too many detailed accounts which don't lend to the story. Is this a story of Virginie, the woman in the portrait, as one would assume from the beginning of the book? Or is it an account of John Singer Sargent's career, as told in the second half of the book? Neither story-line seems to take hold. No doubt that Sargent was extremely talented and now I do know the story behind the portrait as well as a picture of how Americans and artists lived in France during that period in history. But nearly all the characters in the book were shallow and uninteresting. I rushed through the book, wishing for it to end."
3,Long magazine article,I read this book to fill in my knowledge after reading a fictionalized account of Amelie Gautrea. It read like a magazine article in the New Yorker - well researched and interesting yet somehow glossing over any deeper meaning.
2,"A good start on a good subject, but lacking in many regards","Overall, Davis is a competent writer, however, she lacks the imagination, orginality and insight of more established writers of non fiction or those newer nonfiction writers with a unique voice. The author has found herself a good subject with Madame X, but I was sorry that the story was not told by someone with a bit more insight."
5,"Strapless, John Singer Sergeant and the fall of Madame X","I suggest readers get a book of Sargent's paintings before reading this book. Most libraries will have one. I've sent a copy of this to my sister who usually lends her books to my brother after reading them. She treasures this one, so she will keep it. Loved it. For anyone interested in art and history this is fun reading."
5,One little strap! Love this true story!,"This is a wonderful 'history' book and very informative. A pleasure to read. It was interesting to learn about the 'politics' of getting work chosen for review or sale. The controversy this simple painting caused with one strap was significant and hypocritical to me, given it was well known men and women were 'visiting' each other in the late afternoon, enough so the corset makers eventually had to invent hooks and do away with the ribbons so that the women could re-dress faster after an afternoon 'visit!' The Minneapolis Institute of Art has some of Sanger's work."
4,Easy to install,It's pretty easy to install. I've only used it twice. Once for one hour at 40 psi and the next for two hours at 50 psi. It seems to hold the pressure fine but we'll see how durable it is in the long run.
4,Air tight!,I have used a few of these tubes and they seem to hold the air in the tires....at least up to six weeks and counting. Good enough for the price.
1,this company sucks,do not ever order this inner-tube. i got screwed it dod not arrive on time. the tube is cheaply made.
1,Don't waste your money,"Purchased these and put them on my bike as soon as they came. I didn't have time to ride immediately, so my bike sat in the garage. First time I took my bike out, I just rode down the driveway and back, just to make sure they still had air in the tubes. Front tire was flat, next day back tire was flat, both with holes. I've already thrown away the box, so I can't return them. Spend the money and get self healing tires."
1,Poor quality,"I purchased two. The first one didn't last past the first ride with it. Not sure what happened, but I'm not optimistic about what will happen with the second one."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Masterton here takes the Dorian Gray story, and multiplies it. There exists a whole family of Grays, all doing the portrait trick to accomplish a type of immortality.They only have a sort of life, and have to massacre people for the pieces of them they need to stay 'fresh' looking."
2,I couldn't find this anywhere.,I couldn't find a replacement for my damaged cable on my Full size Jimmy. Tos is a nice cable ..if it only fit my firewall hole! (How hard could it be?)
1,OZ - 1st,Bought for a friend as she doesn't have internet. My family and I don't watch stuff that has all the trash contained herein.
4,Pretty Good Show,"This is one tough nail of a show -- it clearly shows that prison life is no picnic in the park. It's violent and has a lot of coarse language. Yet, it's also intelligent. It does make to walk the straight line so you don't end up like these guys. My only dislike is the character telling us very 15 minutes or so what we are looking at and what the moral of each story -- I think viewers are intelligent enough to figure it out."
2,A work of pure fiction. Too unbelievable to even watch!!!,"If you want to watch something completely mindless and ridiculous, Oz is for you. This has to be THE most far-fetched, ridiculous prison show I've ever seen. It's just too painful to watch- Where to begin?? There are no cameras anywhere in the prison apparently; the inmates are allowed to basically supervise themselves (no officers are watching them anywhere apparently except the two in the block); inmates run the kitchen & prepare all the food completely unsupervised; they wear regular clothes and hang out in groups in each others GLASS cells; inmates are beaten, maimed, raped, and do drugs and the prison staff act as if this is completely normal and acceptable behavior. The list could just go on... I admit, I watched the first season on DVD at first out of curiosity, then it was like a train wreck to see what happened next.I won't be insulting my intelligence for season two..."
5,A great set,"I had seen Oz a small number of times when travelling (I don't have HBO at home). Based on that limited exposure, I bought this set.It did not disappoint. The show is gripping, well written, and leaves you wanting to see more.All I can say to HBO is: Bring out the remaining seasons, and soon!"
3,A bit hard to see what the fuss is about,"As a gritty realistic drama about what prison life is like, this macho melodrama makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. However, an average episode has better acting among all players than just about any Hollywood film. I watch it basically as a very dark comedy. One way you might interpret it is this: the people involved in the 'rehabilitation' of the prisoners are like the managers who run a company, and the prisoners are like the employees."
5,like you need a review... just buy it,"absolutely GREAT series. yes, it's a little pricey at $4 + per episode, but who really cares? you know you want it. so buy it."
2,A disappointment,"To me, this is the least successful of the HBO series. There is admittedly a ""can't watch just one"" vibe to it, but more in a junkfood/beachbook kind of way. There doesn't seem to be much substance beneath the macho swagger and need to shock. Some of its concepts (like the Mafia element) are done better elsewhere (like the Sopranos). While 90% of the performances are admirable (with the unfortunate exception of a worthless Ernie Hudson) the writing is often clunky and cliched. And the ""street philosophy from a guy in a wheelchair spinning in a glass cube"" bits are painful. I wanted to like this show, really. I just couldn't."
5,A cool first season...,"I started watching Oz late in the game around season 4. With this new box set dvd of the first season, I was able to see a lot of the main characters origins in prison and see the reason for the conflict between many of the main characters. As usual, Rita Moreno is great and Lee Tergesen and J K. Simmons are excellent as well. A bonus is seeing the Soprano's Edie Falco in her role as a prison guard. There are moments of intense violence, prison rape, and nudity but Oz doesn't shy away from the harsh reality of prison. The dvd box set includes extras such as deleted scenes, commentaries and other items. It is a good start for those of us who are fans of the HBO series but missed it in the beginning. Now I'm hoping they will release the other seasons as well!"
5,Best Drama Series,"OZ is the best drama series I have had the pleasure to watch. The writing and acting far outdo any network program and it's insights and themes keep you thinking long after watching. I don't understand why The Sopranos has grabbed all the glory - this show has kept me enthralled for years and saddened by it's ending; I got bored with the Sopranos after one and a half seasons. Yes, the violence may be to graphic for some; but it's not gratutious, this is a series set in a mens prison with violent offenders. These are not, for the most part, what we see as ""good people""; but step into their lives in OZ and you'll stay with them throughout."
5,A woman's viewpoint of this series,"While reading the editorial review of this series I was amazed to see that it was suppose to be a ""guy's show"". Not so! I have loved this series since it first aired on HBO and catch every rerun that is shown. I have been one of the many fans who begged HBO to release it on video/DVD. While I do enjoy ""The Soprano's"", ""Sex and the City"", and ""Six Feet Under"" my favorite HBO series is and has always been ""Oz"". I think it is well-written, finely acted and not on often enough!! I raved about this show so often to several friends that they all finally went out and started receiving HBO so they could watch ""Oz"" and none have ever regretted it. I highly recommend this series and applaud the fact that the writers, producers, actors and directors hold NOTHING back."
3,BobM and Michael Farrar are so right.,"I also really wanted to like this - heard friends use words like ""riveting"" - addictive in a beach book way is exactly right - tired cliches, yet another leftist writer lecturing viewers about the correct position on current issues - the daring part is full-frontal male nudity... The acting is mostly very good - Rita Moreno is at her best here - but the writing is Quentin Tarantino-lite. It's a fun way to waste time..."
3,USD 55+ for 8 episodes (3 Disc)???,"First, I would like to say that I have not watched Oz but based on most of the reviews I've read about it, it seems a really good series to watch.However, to spend USD 55+ on an 8 episode series is just not worth it as I would rather spend my money on some other good series like 24 or Smallville."
3,OZ the soap opera,"Coming from a person who has worked in a state prison for 15 years, stuff that goes on in OZ is absolutly ridiculous. But having said that I am hooked on the series. I enjoy the mix of strange and interesting characters, and the stories are creative enough. Again I like the series, but the writers and directors should hire someone for realistic content, oh buy the way I could be available. LOL"
2,What?,"I was waiting for a finale that could tie this all together, but ended up stumped. I re-read the details and still have difficulty identifying who the bride is who received the timepiece... her father's the one giving it to her... and yet it is the daughter of the arsonist who comes to the house... oh, I was following along well until the last chapter, there.But, I didn't think it was worth a re-read of the whole book to try to figure out the twist. Were some pages missing from my copy?!?I usually like a good relational novel. This was a sappy novelette.Nicholas Sparks' The Notebook was a better hit."
3,A Look at Evil and Goodness,"Basically a love story beset with tragedy and prejudice of the early 1900's. The characters are predictable, but the story has depth of emotion and will keep the reader going to the last page. The set up is somewhat confusing at the start trying to figure out who is who, but soon clears up."
4,Another good one,"I liked the Christmas Box better, but I think Timepiece was a different kind of story. Though it involves the same MaryAnne and David and the Evans family, it's different altogether. Evans is good for the heart, mind, and soul. Everytime I read his pages, I feel like I'm being let in on a well treasured secret of life. He inspires me to be a better person!"
5,Wonderful book,I really love Richard Paul Evans books...this one is no different...great story and very easy to read..and it came on time and in great condition.
5,Great set for variety of ages,My three year old and nine year old both play with this set and love it. No broken pieces. It's a little frustrating to get it set up after you've turned it off and back on again because you can't have both sensors in the room at the same time when you program it or it will do both of them... but both kids have really enjoyed it.
2,ECW EXTREME ??????????????,"This is the first ECW video I've ever seen.When I bought it I was happy.When I watched it I was shocked.I thought ECW was extreme.All the matches were boring.The only good matches were the T,L,C,C and The ""I Quit"" match.In the T,L,C,C going through the tables were so dumb.If you want to see real hardcore get Royal Rumble 1999 with The Rock and Mankind in an ""I Quit"" match or King Of The Ring 1998 Mankind vs.the Undertaker in a Hell In A Sell match."
2,Alright,"Great moments in history but not the same feel as when I watched it air live in 1997. All of the entrances, music, and interview segments have been cut out. Ruined the experience of trying to get Into the moments that the original ECW made so special"
4,Set to get started understanding ABA,"Richard Foxx's two volume set, Increasing and Decreasing Behaviors... was one of my first introductions to Applied Behavior Analysis, and I still come back to them often. They are written in an easy to read and understandable style. The author is one of the best there is in this field, and it shows in his writing. He knows his subject matter, and he knows how to teach it. Keep this set for the shelves, you won't outgrow them."
1,BE AWARE !!!,"This is the kind of deceitful ad. Do you see the picture? Do you think you will receive 100 CDs in a nice package? No way, you will receive ONE SINGLE CD...Unfortunately there is little to do with this kind of ""ads"", other than not being the victim since the seller tells you so in the small, casual wording."
2,Go back to the studio . . .,". . . re-record this thing without changing gears eighteen times in each song and quit listening to Radiohead/Coldplay for awhile as the lead singer gets some vocal lessons, and you might have something. But guys, chunk-chunk, chorus, chunk, chorus, chunk-chunk . . . it doesn't work for you."
1,Don't be Fooled,"Advertised as The Supremes - this recording is NOT A SUPREMES RECORDING. The Supremes only recorded for Motown records - anything else is fake. While two of the ladies were members of the Supremes on most of the tracks, the third lady was not. Most of the background tracks sound synthesized and fake. And while these ladies might not announce themselves as The Supremes in concert, they certainly do on the cover of this recording and that is a blatant rip-off. Stick to the original recordings."
1,"Don't be fooled, it's not Diana Ross and the Supremes","You will be sorely disappointed if you expect to hear Diana Ross, Mary Wilson, Florence Ballard, Cindy Birdsong or even Jean Terrell on this CD. There are two late-in-the-day fill-in-the-slots Supremes (who did minimal recording with the group during its final, non-peak years) as well as a third nobody, and ""at least one of these individuals"" is featured on each of the recordings here. The singers are reasonably competent, but this is not ""the Supremes,"" let alone ""Diana Ross and..."" Save your money."
4,Teaching About God,I use this book with early childhood and elementary age students. I find it is a good discussions starter and the pictures keep everyone's attention.
4,Vargas with strings front and center,"Danzon might not leap to mind as the most interesting vehicle for mariachi, but when you consider that mariachi was originally centered on the strings, the danzon is pretty decent way to hear something of what the mariachi sounded like before it became a trumpet band.Of course Vargas is just flat out perfect. Mariachi doesn't get any better than this. The strings are in tune and vibrato is limited to phrase ends and cadences. The sound has a very traditional feel to it. The guitarón, guitaras and vilahuelas produce a wonderfully organic rythm section to keep the danzon moving. The trumpets are mostly subdued and playing a highlighting role. All in all the interpretations are very convincing.This is Mariachi music of a lazy sunday afternoon."
2,sorority girls 3d,"not that entertaining. the girls are not really sexy or simulating, action was kind of board no climaxs. I've seen hotter sorority girls. many of them were petity."
2,My Cat Couldn't Take It,"My cats really like it, and it is inexpensive and also control tartars. My cats are fed mostly dry food though.------ Update 12/27/2012 -----While My 11-lb Russian Blue has no trouble with this treat, my 7-lb toby couldn't take it.Since I feed two types of dry cat food and used to give three types of treats per day, it took me a while to isolate the root of problem.As long as my toby cat consumes any number of this treat, she ALWAYS had a very stinky and often half-watery pile of feces on the same day. The more pieces I fed her, the more serious the syndrome became."
3,Couldn't Fill Order,"The vendor said they had the quantity and gave me a ship date, a tracking number, then 1 week later said they didn't have any in stock."
3,jazz in the 80s,"It was a little too kenny g-ish and impotent. A sign of the times, I suppose. The party was definitely, to me, a poor climax. I would have expected a more impromptu gathering where the players played, and there was a bit more wildness. As is, the movie is, as Goldblum explains to his about to depart wife, an affirmation, that ""we're hip."" And in that sense, it's a bit lame. Goldblum and Whitaker were both excellent, perhaps the best acting I've ever seen from either of them. They carry the movie beyond the somewhat one-dimensional dialogue (yeah, and we'll play!) and music that was okay, but not as good as the music in Mo Better Blues, another movie about a trumpeter. The scene when Goldblum's wife is supposed to be singing?? Trash. In fact, the wife more often than not, annoys me. But the scenes showing the two leads playing their instruments are great. Furhtermore, Forrest Whitaker had the talent, throughout the movie, to actually take the film ""to the end."""
1,Lack of Information,This item does not show how many capsules are included.I think that it would be nice for the customer to know.
1,Cost is TOO MUCH for a DVD!!!,"This is a great movie, I remember watching it when I was younger and wanted to buy it for my daughter. I don't understand why this DVD cost what it does. I have bought movies that are better and more popular for much less. Even Wizard of Oz, which is a classic, is under $20. I will never pay this much for a single DVD... this is CRAZY pricing. Brian Bloom is super sexy in this movie but still not sexy enough to make me want to pay more than $25 for a DVD. $25 is even too high but doable."
3,Funtime movie,"Old fun movie with lots of stars. Moralistic ending, easy to predict. Tracey Gold and Tempest Bledsoe. Kelsey Grammer too. The kind of movie to watch with teenage daughters."
1,Greg,"I am very disappointed in this iron. It only steams when you press the steam button. It makes your clothes shine. It is no where as good as the Black and Decker 2030. I had to order another 2030 that one again as I was duped by the reviews I read. I would not recomment this iron to anyone. The 2030 is the iron of choice, in my opinion."
2,No Display,"I purchased this iron less than 6 months ago, and the digital display has already broken. Unfortunately, the display tells you what setting to use (how hot), and I cannot remember what setting was what. Now granted, it has fallen off the ironing board a few times, but I have never had this problem with previous, less expensive irons."
3,Black and Decker iron - just OK,"I purchased the Black and Decker iron about a month ago and have had several opportunities to use it. I like that it doesn't use a lot of water to make steam, nor generate a lot of heat over the ironing board. I don't like that if you don't know to turn on the steam button, you don't have steam. I don't like that the iron doesn't get as hot as I would like it. I don't like that the cord doesn't retract. My last iron cost about $150. I swore that after that iron broke in less than two years, I would never spend that much for an iron. When all is said and done, this Black and Decker is very close in quality to the more expensive iron, which means that both were just ""ok""."
2,Somewhat Disappointing,"This iron is lighter than expected (have owned the Digital 2020 previously) for what I need for garment construction. The non-stick plate creates static when ironing paper or tissue which is sometimes needed for pattern drafting.the blue lighted display is also a little hard to readHowever, the spray nozzle works well. The push buttons for up and down on the heat level are good. Relatively inexpensive from Amazon. If you need a light iron this is for you."
1,You get what you pay for,"About 18 months ago, I bought my first B & D iron. At first, it worked just fine and I loved it. In about six months, it started acting funny. In the middle of ironing, it would turn itself off. It didn't happen often, and I didn't think much of it. But then it started to happen much more often, and wouldn't turn back on until it cooled down. About 8 months ago, I called B & D customer service and replaced it with a D5500. The D5500 worked fine until a few days ago, when, all of a sudden, it turned itself off! I let it cool down, turned it back on, and within two minutes, it spontaneously shut down again. I called customer service, and after 25 minutes on hold, I left a message on their answering machine. As of now, I'm still waiting for a call back. Maybe B & D should stick to making power tools and let Rowenta make irons."
