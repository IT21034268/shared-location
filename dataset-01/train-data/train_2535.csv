1,Buy Mystery Shopper's Manual Instead,"It's so obvious that the five-star reviews are fake. This book is riddled with spelling and grammatical errors, casting a huge shadow of doubt over the author's PhD credentials.Buy Mystery Shopper's Manual or google the subject for real information."
3,Not my style.,The pearls were not the size or color I wanted. The necklace wasstrung to tight and would not bend or lay on neck smoothly.Sorry. Thank you for your service.
3,Broken,"This is the second item I've ordered through Amazon which has been broken. This is really disappointing,and frustrating, since I gave it as a gift. The dishes themselves are nice."
4,Great tunes to dance to,I have been taking ballroom dancing for over a year and I wanted to improve on my salsa. Heard one of Tito's songs by accident while watching a couple of pro's doing a routine on youtube and immediately looked it up. Immensely happy with the CD ~ its got some great tunes and the songs really gets me grooving.
2,Find a better book,"This book is comprehensive, yes, but the explanations are poor. I find his writing style difficult to follow. The book is poorly edited as well, for example, the second chapter introduces datapath logic cells and then immediately goes into a multipage treatise of multiplier architecture. Interesting information but it seems much out of place given the context. The problems are not very helpful either. Often you will need to search for information outside of the text in order to complete the question. The author obviously knows the subject well, I just don't think he does a very good job of teaching it."
4,A Walk Down Memory Lane,"I have to admit that I didn't like all the songs on this CD. However, there were several that reminded me of the past and I enjoy listening to it. I would have liked it better if it would have included all the ""Gidget"" songs, especially the one from ""Gidget Goes to Rome""."
1,James Darren Gidget goes Hawaiian,"I am very disappointed. This album was available for $14.99 and I ordered it. All of a suddden it is not available, but I find it in your music section for 29.98. I should not have been told that it was availabe and then not. I order a lot of things from you folks and this is very discouraging. I wouldn't mind if it had not turned up in your add at a higher cost...."
3,Tiny and has bugs,I am sad because this is the plant I wanted the most. The others I ordered were big and mostly healthy but this one was tiny and has something eating the leaves. I bug sprayed it a few times and have my fingers crossed!
3,mites love my bicolors!,"So far have had nothing but problems with my bicolors - spider mites seem to gravitate to them (my other buddleias haven't been bothered), and they are MUCH less vigorous overall than the other buddleias I have in my garden. I can't report about the blooms, because they are just now setting blooms (again, my other buddleias have been blooming for weeks - I live in the South).I'll be interested to see how they do next year, once they've ""settled in"" - so far, I'm underwhelmed."
5,Gotta love the Fat Cat!,"After looking high and low and all over ebay for the original series of Garfield, I got on Amazon and ordered the 'fat cat 3 pack' books. Much cheaper and a lot easier...I don't have 15-20 little books to contend with. Only 5 fat ones. My son loves them!"
1,Spinning review,Music is death-fully boring. Video is not very challenging.Because music is boring you are not motivated to do the video.
4,Great workout!,"I don't have any other spin dvd's, so I can't compare this to any at home spin ""class"". However, comparing this to a gym spin class, it is like having the class right in your living room! Great cardio workout. You spend a lot of time standing and hovering over the seat. I was dying for it to end! And I only did the express version! I need to work up to the long ride. The music is the only thing that I didn't care for. It needs to be more upbeat. Other than that, it is perfect. Gets your heart rate up and makes you a sweaty mess! Just what the doctor ordered! I love Cathe so much, I bought the bike because of this dvd! I bought a Gold's Gym Cycle Trainer from my local Walmart for $267! The chain is a tad loud, but the bike is sturdy and solid. You get a great workout with the 40 lb flywheel!"
4,Some really good moments on here,This CD had 9 tracks produced by 9th Wonder.At times Splash sounds like a poor mans old Nas and there are some brilliant tracks on here that are classic songs and some of the best of 2005 but there are some bad moments on here.But all in all it's a good CD that people will probally like.All 8's here
4,Great Value!,"I purchased this set a while back when it was offered for $10. The set arrived nice and shiny. They felt great since they are 0.6mm thick, as a previous reviewer noted. However, after just one use, some of the coating came off the 9"" square pan. The same is true for the loaf pan after a few uses, as well as the Farberware muffin pan I purchased to match the set. I always washed my bakeware by hand, and I was a little disappointed that the coating came off. However, I have used the 9x13 pan at least 15 times and the pie pans a few times, and the coating is still perfectly fine on those.Overall, it is a great deal for the price."
1,Why?,"Why do people buy this stuff? The teflon coating eventually comes off and you end up eating it. Do you really want to eat teflon? Not only that, but heat will cause the coating to emit gasses - toxic gasses that you will breath in. Google ""non-stick coatings toxic"" and you will see."
2,Good but not great,This pans are ok for the price. I washed them in the dishwasher once and one of the pans started to rust on the underside of the lip. Next time I will spend a little more and go with stainless steel.
3,Decent set for the price,"They're good pans, but they discolor easily and need a good scrubbing from time to time. This is hard due to not wanting to scratch the non-stick coating"
2,Farberware Nonstick 6 piece bakeware set,"Update to review. I already had to send one 9 x 13 pan back because it started to rust. It was replaced but cost me $4 to send back. Now another pan is rusting. Not quite so in love with it now. I don't believe the lifetime warranty any longer!I love this bakeware. I also purchased a professional quality Caphalon non- stick set but things stick to it and it burns if you aren't careful. Everything bakes evenly in these and the price is very inexpensive for the quality. I purchased an additional Farberware set for use at our lake cabin.It is very heavy, has nice handles and amazing clean up. No soaking at all. Just don't ruin it by spraying non-stick products on them.UPDATE on December 2011--By now, every piece of this ""Lifetime Guaranteed"" set has rusted. Would not recommend Faberware to anyone and am buying more expensive set that really will last a lifetime without me having to mail back piece by piece at my expense."
4,MAKES THE SPEAKER TWEEK!!!!!!!!!,"i'm loving this release from USDA. The beats are powerful as usual. i gave it four stars because i didnt see shawty redd in the production credits. how can they make a cd without him? but on the cool, i'm feeling it and this will start my summer right."
2,As a true jeezy fan I give this garbage 2 stars,"Are you guys serious?!?!?! How can you rate this piece of junk of a cd anything higher than a 2. I am not hating on them, just being honest. There isn't one song on this cd where I caould listen to the whole thing. Jeezy has fell off. If want to hear some real Jeezy music before he got saturated with mainstream, listen to Thug Motivation 101, Boyz N Da Hood album, and the DJ Drama Trap or Die Mixtape."
3,"Not Bad, But Could Be Better","This album is lackluster to me. I wasn't able to really listen to it from beginning to end because I simply wasn't impressed. Though I respect the effort, I think USDA has failed to live up to the strong success of Jeezy's two prior solo albums 'Thug Motivation' and 'The Inspiration'. The USDA album seems to be thrown together and hopefully next time, the effort will be better."
1,Waste of money!!!,"Not only does the shipped product not look like the picture but it's clearly mentioned on the pack that it is good for LCD screens and it's recommended not to use it for camera lens.So, I'm realy disappointed with this product.Would NOT recommend this product to anyone.I think I'll order original LensPen from some other seller, but I won't risk my camera lens being ruined."
2,Ruger gripe,I had a similar hogue grip which I put on an old model vaquero so ordered this to match up another old vaquero. It does not fit either the old vaquero or my new vaquero or a ruger blackhawk
5,Awesome!,"I have limitations regarding exercise. This is perfect for older people, people who are restarting an exercise program or have physical limitations. The wonderful thing is the way Dr. Cheng teaches the moves, slowly with a lot of repetition. Believe me when done I feel it. Itfeels good! Anyone could benefit from this."
3,True Exploitation of a Very Real Crime.,"Although Mr. Linedecker offers much detail, he also attempts to write this book with the hopes of selling the script to Hollywood so some details are sensationalized for that purpose.Unfortunately, Mr. Linedecker does not give ANY details regarding the strict upbringing of the boys at Fairhaven Christian Academy and their family's attendance at Fairhaven Baptist Church in Chesterton In for several years leading up to the time of the murders. Mr. Paul Witte was a member in high regard within the early church there, as was his mother - both of the murder victims.Instead Mr. Linedecker begins with a fanciful legend based loosely on fact regarding an early local Lakeshore resident and how in his mind the stories were similar in sensationalism.Having attended grade school with Eric, I found the author's focus misleading and disappointing. I wanted more of a profile and less of a National Enquirer version with fabrications made and details left out."
3,The House,"The house that the grandmother was killed in is the same house I live in. My parents were the ones that bought the house at the auction. I sleep in the same room that the grandmother was killed in. The ironic thing is that my father is best friends with the person that they bought the trash compactor from in LaPorte,Indiana. At least the house was blessed and then my mom went into labor with me."
2,What is a personal relationship with God?,"I have nothing against the product that I was sent. It is fine, except that it wasn't what I thought it was. I ordered 3 of these from 3 different sellers. All came quickly and in good condition. I thought I was ordering a Bible study booklet of the same name with questions and comments. The booklets that came were more like pamphlets. They just gave information. I was annoyed that I got charged about $4.00 for shipping when the actual cost to mail one little pamphlet was probably less than $1.00. Buyer beware -- make sure the item you are looking at is the one you want. The booklet and the Bible study guide is from the same author/publishers and the titles were exactly the same, so they were easy to mix up. Considering I had ordered one each from 3 different sellers, I kept the pamphlets to try to use them in the future. It would be too much trouble to return them."
3,Disappointing,"I found this book, the more into it I read, to be very disappointing - there is little description of the storms or even of repairs made during rough crossings, and it often reads like 'I did this and then I did that"" with little connection. I felt like great gobs of information was simply cut out. The photos are mostly of the author (ok, you're kinda cute Jon but I'd really rather see the yachts and deck shots), very disappointing - kept wanting to learn more about his Mother, who did sound very interesting but either the author isn't too articulate or his editor stripped out too much - there are better books available: Knox-Johnson's or Bernard Montessier's ""The Long Way"" - some good ones on Sydney-Hobart and Falmouth -"
4,Good read!,"Good read for anyone who is thinking about sailing offshore or life on the seven seas. Balanced, witty and well written."
3,Great Visual for the Mind,As an avid sailor one is always looking for their mermaid but the story is actually less than I would have hoped for. I wish him well in the future.
5,Fun read !,"I enjoyed reading FWM. I found it to be a lighthearted title & had purchased the book on a whim as I needed a read for a Western Caribbean cruise. This is not a how to book for those of you looking for that sort of title. But, rather a lighthearted regaling of one sailor's past excursions that will make you smile & laugh at times.I found the recanting of sailing stories to be enjoyable & had me not wanting to put the book down. Some of the Caribbean ports that this captain moored in, well I could see them clearly in my mind's eye as I had once lived in the islands myself. It was a fun read about a fellow that had found his calling in life & some of the trials that he encountered while performing his life's work. As most may know anything involving sails & the ocean is rarely easy or smooth.I wholeheartedly recommend the title. A nice read for a mental ""getaway""."
5,Absolute favorite book of all time,"Kretschmer earns your respect, grabs your heart and opens your soul with this book. This guy bares it all. After I read through his 'Used boat notebook' I expected this book to be filled with all the little details I needed in order to function as a liveaboard cruising sailor. It didn't. Instead I sat in the cockpit of John's boat and listened to him tell me a story about people and places, love and work. From it, I know each step I take closer to my goal (liveaboard) is the right step. I'll find the details I need, but they won't amount to the value of this book. This book is so extraordinary I am beginning to doubt that he's a better sailor than a writer!Not bad for a guy from Detroit!"
3,It's not all glamour....,"Although I loved reading this book....in retrospect, I believe there are some comments I want to make concerning it....The writer has clearly and well...expressed the problems, difficulties, uncertainties, delays, and negatives of being a Delivery Skipper...yet...I came away feeling that he did not express the positives!!! Maybe we are supposed to KNOW them! Also, I felt the characters of Molly and Lesa were not developed in the least...and unfortunately, they just became 'names'...instead of souls... But, overall, definitely worth reading...there ARE some lines and situations in the book that are cleverly portrayed and very funny!! Like remembering why you don't need it anyway when it breaks!!!"
2,wasted opportunity,"Terrible script, shoddy direction and sloppy editing. The interviews lead nowhere and offer no new insights into Farrokhzad's life and work. Through the almost 3 hours of this documentary, no attempt is made to contextualize the poet in her social, political and cultural milieu. Not even Bertolucci's beautiful images make this film worth watching. The English subtitles are outrageously bad."
1,Never got it,Don't know never received it but Amazon did give me my money back. I really want the products!!
3,dumbest thing I've ever purchased!,"I bought this for my kid's birthday party, thinking they could limbo. Didn't realize it didn't come with anything to hold it up. Duh! Kids still had fun with it, has many uses with imaginative minds!"
5,Change your perspective of life after PC surgery!!,"This book makes you aware of many things nobody told me would happen after I had PC Surgery. Your whole system changes and without help it is difficult to live a normal decent life with your spouse. I should have bought it immediatly after surgery, 3 years ago, but didn't know about it until 2 months ago.We Survivours of PC should unite to help others with the tremendous resources like this book and many others. Read the book, it will get you back on the right track. Love life is not over after PC!!"
4,A must read,"This book is a must read for a couple who has just undergone surgery for prostate cancer. Although I had already read some of the information elsewhere, it would have been handy to have had this resource earlier after surgery. It is also beneficial to have this resource for both patient and spouse."
5,A must read for people who doubt Satan's existence!,"Overcome with fear, and sinking into depression and alcoholism, Dorothy Marie England shows us how demonic forces use our weaknesses to chip away at us and destroy us. Her penetrating story demonstrates how this took place, step by step, until finally demonic manifestations began to occur in her own life, propelling her to seek spiritual help! This book is a must read for anyone who questions the existence of Satan or demons or anyone who is interested in the study of demonic hauntings. Ms. England also explains and shows how mentalities, such as racism, classism, and low self-esteem, so present in our society, are actually demonic in nature--only some of the tools Satan uses to ""wear us down."" Makes you aware of how the devil can influence your life. Very poingant! My sister and I both read this book in one sitting!"
4,Wonderful Performance...But,"I received this DVD along with Claudio Abbado's Nine Beethoven Symphonies from EuroArts. The Beethoven DVD set was released in 1080HD with a 1.77:1 aspect ratio, has multi-angles and contains 413 minutes of music from recent performances in a beautiful location. It cost $27.99.This Beethoven EMI DVD was released in 480 standard DVD with a 1.33:1 aspect ratio (which is just right for your old analog TV) and contains 59 minutes of music from a 1995 performance. It cost $15.97.Don't get me wrong: this is an excellent DVD, with top performers, and I will watch this one many times. But it explains why I always look first at EuroArts/MediciArts when I buy classical DVDs. By cutting corners and issuing mostly old content the established companies are losing customers to the new kid on the block. The future is here."
2,"For a balanced discussion, see . . .","For a balanced discussion of what the Church is to do in these coming decades, see ""Selling Out the Church,"" by Phil Kenneson and James Street. This book (also available from Amazon) provides helpful perspective on the relationship between Church and culture; it takes a more critical look at the way the Church percieves and pursues growth. Barna has a blind side that Kenneson and Street are diligently describing."
4,A Wake Up Call to the Church in America,"George Barna paints a gloomy and desperate portrait of the current church in America. He explains that the majority of churches are archaic in style, irrelevant to the culture and impotent to impact society. With the nation in dire moral straits, it needs the church to rise up to be salt and light. Barna charges the church to take up this mantel and then gives a prescription of necessary changes. Barna does a fine job of explaining the problems and challenges facing the America church. He also lists her shortcomings. His assessment and indictments were blunt and fairly accurate. I felt his comment about America that we have done a ""repositioning of religion as a commodity that we consume, rather than one in which we invest ourselves"" was accurate and inditing. I also felt his list of solutions were viable and worth embracing. Barna's passion comes across in the pages of the book. I recommend the book to anyone interested in a new church reformation."
3,Good Analysis but Obviously Dated,"This title is one of those books I've wanted to read for a long time but didn't get to it until now. Written in 1998, it was a very timely, well-crafted work that gave a wake-up call to the church in America. As I read it in 2005 however, I wonder, ""What would Barna say today?"" He states here that the next five years for the church would be critical. Well, the ""next five years"" passed by 2003.There are many points here that still apply to the church, just as points made in Barna's ""Frog in the Kettle"" still apply. This book however, is clearly dated. I would encourage a potential reader to look for a more recent treatment of the church as it presently stands in American society."
4,Great movie!!,Such a great movie of when times were simpler and family was everything! A great sequel to Cheaper by the dozen and better than I remember.
3,So now I know.,Cheaper by the dozen set up to want to see the rest of the story. Now the ladies can be efficiency experts.
5,Great Movie,"Excellent Movie! Thanks so much for making this movie available! I read the book tears ago and then when I saw it in movie form, I couldn't wait! Thanks!"
5,Love this movie!,"This movie, and its predecessor, Cheaper by the Dozen, are wonderful movies. I was so excited to find out they are coming out on DVD! Wonderful movies the whole family can enjoy. No worrying about what kind of things your children will see in this movie! It is a charming tale. Funny and sweet. A definate must have!!!!"
4,Cheaper By the Dozen 2 - the original sequel,"Few realize today that the ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" films with Steve Martin were actually sequels themselves. If you've seen the orignal Cheaper by the Dozen with Myrna Loy than you know that Steve Martin's version didn't even attempt at staying close to the original storyline. With that said, Belles on their Toes is a totally and completely different movie than the 2nd movie in Steve Martin's Cheaper by the dozen films. In Belles on their Toes, we're treated to a story of how the 12 kids grew through the baby graduating. This is a nice story and thoroughly enjoyable as a film in itself. The fact that it's a sequel, in my opinion, doesn't add or detract from it's enjoyment factor."
3,FUN ENTERTAINMENT,"This was a very pleasant and enjoyable movie and the picture quality was sharp and bright but the people and objects seemed to have a blue shadow around them and the sound was lousy. It was like listening through a tin can.I wish the studios would release more of Jeffery Hunter's films such as ""Man Trap"" with Stella Stevens if it even still exists somewhere or ""Brainstorm"" with Anne Francis."
1,Damages Easily,"I purchased three of these on 8/21 and am on the 2nd one right now. The 2nd one is broken (It's the piece right above the camera eye) but still stays attached to the phone, I will use it until it no longer stays attached. They damage easily and I won't buy the same type next time. Price is not expensive, so I suppose it's not meant to last long."
1,Defective Item,"I ordered this cover and it broke after 2 weeks. Eforcity was really good about sending out a new replacement product immediately. Unfortunately, my replacement product arrived broken."
1,WARNING - DO NOT BUY!!,A PIECE OF JUNK THAT BROKE AFTER BEING ON MY PHONE FOR 2 DAYS!!! WARNING - DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!
4,Ear awakening!!,"The other night I was out with an old friend who had spent four years in San Francisco. In her attempt to help me with the flavor of the city, she popped in this Eric McFadden cd, and I have to say I was awe-struck. For all I knew, this was the second coming of Andres Segovia. Anyone who enjoys hearing masterful classical guitar work NEEDS this cd! Bravissimo!!"
1,"Defective - wouldn't fly over 6"" and lost power after 5 minutes","We purchased this item as a special gift for my father, who knows how to fly R/C helicopters. He fully charged the unit, and the helicopter did not have enough power to get more than 6 inches off the ground. After 5 minutes of running the helicopter and trying to get it to fly higher, the heli lost power, flipped over, crashed, and broke. So here we spent $56 for what we thought was a nice gift, and my father got to fly it one time and just 6"" off the ground. We're incredibly disappointed and P.O.'d. We're not sure whether we will get a refund or will be able to exchange this item. My advice to you: DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!"
1,Worst Chet Yet,"I love Chet Baker, but this is truly the worst I've heard yet. There is no connection between him and the songs, no connection between him and the musicians. The feeling I get is that he was paid to sing, so sing he will, even tho he doesn't want to. Don't waste your money, there is no Chet there."
4,Excellent but expensive,"This is the ultimate product for storing, managing, viewing and even editing your digital pictures and also other media. Pictures can easily be organized in hierarchial catalog sets. html picture galleries for web publishing can be created wirthout problems as well as xml-files. The program works with thumbnails, not with the original files which obviously makes the catalog files smaller. The original files are easily accessible. On the negative side some functions are less than intuitive to use and tagging can be a chore. But when it is done the excellent search function makes it well worth the trouble.The prize, around $ 300, is excessive, though. Expression Web Designer sells for around $ 90, a contrast which is difficult to understand."
3,Disappointing,"This book seems to miss the mark in an otherwise enjoyable series. While the descriptions of the teas and food are good, the mystery falls short. Throughout the whole story, Theo moans that she's having trouble finding clues and solving the murder; then suddenly at the end it comes to her and she goes racing off to find the proof. There is never any mention as to how the murder was done in that house during a concert with numerous people or how the secret rooms played into it. It was not a satisfying conclusion at all. The characters seem to be acting as they normally do, and Haley's manic character has been toned down at last, although she has some expressions that don't really ring true: ""Pop a chill pill, Drayton!"" Who talks like that? In general, the characters are likable, but they're not enough to carry this poorly planned mystery."
3,Death of a Duke,"Theodosia Browning, the owner of the Indigo Tea Shop, is back again, catering a fund-raising event for the restoration of an old home which has been donated to the Charleston Heritage Society. The first murder in the book takes place in the first chapter, with a second one following later. The first victim is Duke Wilkes, a retired businessman who was interested in politics and Civil War re-enactments. His widow asks for Theo's help in finding the killer, and she obliges by carrying on her own investigation. There are several red herrings about possible suspects and motives, but the final solution comes out of left field, without much preparation in the story. Theo also begins a new romance, but it is tepid at best. The best part of the book is the interaction between the established characters in the series, and the descriptions of the ambience and food of Charleston, but this is not enough to overcome the problems with the plot."
3,Cozy murder,"7th in the 'Tea Shop Mystery' series, this a cozy read - entertaining characters & mystery with a twist. The heroine owns a tea shop in Historic Charleston SC and seems to stumble into a murder or a mystery. The book includes interesting Tea facts & recipes. A light, easy read - always lots of fun."
2,Where was the proofreader for this book?,"I have been a great fan of these teashop mysteries from the moment they appeared, but I was so very disappointed in the latest one. The plot didn't seem as well thought-out as in previous books, but what really drove me mad was the huge (and unacceptable) number of typographical errors in the book. I am always slightly addled by Ms. Childs' refusal to use the word ""of"" after the word ""couple"" (a couple pots of tea, as opposed to a couple OF pots of tea), but the excessive errors in this book simply showed a sloppy level of proofreading. Now that we are asked to pay for hardback editions of the books, I expect quality to be better, not worse. I may give the series one more chance, but I have refrained from recommending this book to other tea lovers, as I normally would do."
4,"Tea, Scones and Murder Mahem A Delightful Experience","Laura Childs has done it again. She pleases the reader with wonderful characters, a diabolical plot and recipes for tea you want to write down and experiment for yourself. What a remarkable combination of pleasing the senses. Ms Childs does not disappoint with each edition of her tea shoppe series. Familiar names and new quirky characters reign supreme while interesting antics take place to move the story along rapidly. You are never bored reading Laura Childs - perhaps salviating over the scrumptious menus presented or dry-mouthed wanting that cup of tea, but never bored. Thank you for providing a couple evenings of pure pleasure."
2,The mystery is ...,"The mystery is -- how can anyone ""enthuse"" over these books? The author picked up a couple of other series after this one got going, and promptly slipped in the quality of her story lines in particular. Instead of working on tight plots, she just throws in more and more wild stuff. Rush to publication. On to the next one. Unfortunate."
2,A Deplorable Brew,"I am glad I am not alone in my estimation of Laura Childs' ""Blood Orange Brewing"" the seventh book in her Tea Shop Mystery series. I thought the author had found a unique thread to take within the mystery genre, but her writing has gotten even worse throughout the series. Having read the previous six books I can say that ""Blood Orange Brewing"" is the worst of the bunch. I will not read any more books from this series, or any other books by Childs for that matter, as my disappointment with the last two books made this the last-chance effort for the author. The plot is convoluted, the main character is unlikeable, and the grammar is deplorable. Childs does not seem to know how to write a sentence, for the book is replete with fragments and uneven sentences that go no where. I won't even bother going into the plot of this novel because it is not worth it and this book definitely wasn't worth the paper wasted to print it."
2,Nancy Drew Drinks Tea,Laura Childs writes like an adolescent girl. With sentence fragments. And italics.The background of tea knowledge will be of interest to aficionados. The mystery is light and the story overall entertaining. But there is no character development: no changes or growth in anyone.An entertaining light read. But there's not enough here to intrigue me to read others in the series.
1,Amature hour . . .,"I love Vienna and will put up with almost anything to enjoy views of the city but the sound and general picture quality of video made it a real disappointment. It has the feel of a 70's home movie. The content isn't bad but the production values are substandard. Although this is packaged under a different title by a different company, this is the same exact video as ""Summer In Vienna"" which has the same quality problems. I'd give this one a miss."
2,The Title is Misleading,"The book really focused on outlining the pitfalls of the three types of educational choices: 1) public, 2) private, 3) homeschooling. There seemed to be an obvious bias in favor of homeschooling, although it did describe the challenges of that choice. In a nutshell, the point of the book is that regardless of what choice a parent ends up making for the child, the real key to success is parent involvement. I really felt that he was preaching to the choir. If a parent went to the effort to find this book and read it, that parent is probably already the one who is going to be heavily involved in their child's education.What the book didn't discuss at all is various personalities of children and what types of environments might suit them best - which is really what I was after. The book is completely void of any mention of learning styles, or things that a parent might specifically look for or ask about in making a school choice for their child."
3,can not organise tools larger than ur ring.,good quality but not much usefull if u r looking for something to organise tools larger than ur ring.kind of small and needed it self to be organised and put into a larger box..
3,3Com - Networking U.S. Robotics Internal 2-Way Cable Modem,"3com has a good repution for reliability and it will probably carry over to this product, but why restrict yourself with an INTERNAL cable modem.Keep your options open with an external one. This way if you want to add a hardware firewall or a hardware firewall/switch made by Linksys or one of their competitors, you will not be left out in the cold."
3,An interesting read,"When Ken and the boys forget Lila's birthday she walks out for a month's ""leave."" Shell-shocked, Ken is forced to step up to the domestic plate and realise just how much he has taken her for granted during the marriage.Lila, for her part, realises just how much she has contributed to the situation she is in, but I have to say I thought certain part of this happened a little too soon. Do they get back together and if so, how this is achieved is the plot of this story.Well-written and put together, I understood it, having been in much the same position as Lila many years ago, but I am not sure that I liked the finish overmuch. Don't want to give a spoiler so will say no more!"
2,disappointing,I was in the USAF & was a jet mechanic. I had expectations far and above what these DVD's had to offer. The content & quality were extremely poor. Don't waste your money !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Daring and Insightful,"This collection is a wonderful find. Sharply observed and elegantly written, Berkman's stories present the struggles of young urban women to develop social and sexual mores that they can believe in. The struggle is ultimately a hopeful one. Over and over again, in stories that are alternately gritty and graceful, the characters rediscover--or reaffirm--a fragile faith in the world. To renew your faith in contemporary fiction, buy this book."
4,Good NYC Subway Reading,"Even though many of Berkman's stories are set in the SF Bay Area, they could just as easily take place in East Village tattoo parlors, cafes in SoHo, or grungy cold-water flats in Alphabet City. And even though this is an odd review, it's my genuine experience: Berkman's tales are a particularly delightful read on the New York City subway. Forget worrying about chemical attacks; just get a copy of this book and enjoy yourself! One can get on at 14th Street and finish a story before hitting Canal. Now that's a New York state of mind!"
2,Not penney's best,"The Book is mostly spanking and pee not tickling. Some flashing and one hilarious scene. This is where the girls are sort of strong armed into a ""cabaret"" at a new club. They are setup in kind of a mezzanine with a metal industrial floor with spaces that you can see the VIP balcony/lounge through. The girls don't setup a strip and girl-girl show as expected but instead do a spanking and pee show that really puts the pee in VIPee."
1,Misleading Title,"If you're looking to buy this book based upon its title, save your money. The only tickling scenes are very brief and have more to do with ""water sports"" than with tickling."
1,the trouble with nephews,"At this point, it seems I'm the odd man out here. Laurie McBain always writes well, but the characters and plot just didn't grab me. The main character, Mara, was mainly tangled up with her unreliable brother, her dependent nephew, or their money problems while being harassed by the hero for a previous wrong she had done to his (the hero's) nephew. Anyway, suffice to say I actually read this about a month before writing this and had to review it quite a bit to be able to write this."
2,Making an easy subject as hard as possible,"This book was so redundant. Every topic is covered over and over. It's almost like every sentence had to be written out in three different ways to fill space of something. It might be because it was one of the last paralegal courses I had to take that the material seemed obvious. However, I didn't like the writing. It seemed choppy and unnecessarily complicated. It also contradicted some of the stuff that my professor taught, which made take-home tests really fun.On the other hand, the book arrived water damaged and the binding was broken so pages were falling out of it. When I let the seller know they gave me a refund and let me keep the book, so the price was right!"
3,No spark,"Purchased Beck Arnley ignition coil new in box after finding a great price on Amazon. After installation, the new coil did not work/defective/no spark. I have used Beck Arnley replacement parts before with never an issue. Coil was returned to vendor and Amazon refunded my purchase price."
2,A disapointing book,"Why will I give generously only 2 stars ? Because this book is an exact copy of the beautiful book on Architecture from Ron von der Meer. Same size, same model. Of course different pop-ups, but badly made, opening with a too much easy and wellknown pop-up of a Pyramid. I agree with M. Langton about the very bad Chrysler Building. All around the book, ridiculous thin paper folding without any interest. At the end of the book, there is a thick box with no use. Where von der Meer in the same kind of box did put a lot of nice things to use in it. No, this book does absolutly not deserve it's extremly high expensive price, compare to the quality and low price of the last Sabuda's book.One must say that the chinese are actually the best pop-up maker regarding quality."
1,NSL,"The pop-ups in this book are generally just too elementary. Several of the pop-up pages actually arrived with some some tears in the buildings. On the other hand, the the choice of the structures showed a good diversity in design styles and followed an appropriate timeline through history."
3,Not bad...,"I was excited to get this title. For my needs, this book concentrated too much on use with thirdparty software and not enough on the depth of C4d itself and it's own modules. Perhaps that is what was intended. I don't regret adding it to my reference shelf for the odd consultation (books like this are almost always worth even a few great nuggets of knowlege) but it did not live up to my expectations of a definitive C4d reference. That may have had more to do with my expectations then the book itself."
3,Hardys in Nevada.,"This is an average Hardy Boys book. Someone's trying to kill Ted Prescott, the father of a friend of Frank's girlfriend. Lots of action, an okay book."
2,Not helpful,Suggested negotiating with boss tricks and looking for opportunities that offer flexible hours. Nothing I didn't know already.
3,Good entertainment from a long-gone era,"The ""Light Crust Doughboys, 1936-1941"" is an enjoyable pistache of regional music that kept a lot of people happy by their radios in the 30s.Excellently played blues, western swing, and regional country melodies gives the listener an enjoyable 26 musical items from this British import. Leave it to the British to keep history alive. I rate this 3 stars whereas I put the Hoosier Hot Shots at 4 stars. So what you need to do is buy this one but really check out the HHS, too!"
4,Great!,I love all 3 DVDS.but the only reason i gave it 4 stars is i wish it would come with Holiday Celebrations.
4,Great Collection,This is a great collection of all the Garfield Specials made from books into movies.
2,Garfield: Feline Fantasies Review,"4 words: RIPOFF OF BOBBY""S WORLD. The only thing i liked about the tape is the female spy who is in it. I give this moive a 2 out of 10."
3,Interesting exploratory study of eccentrics.,"This book is most amusing when describing eccentric characters, though many have been covered in previous books. The ""scientific study"" is sandwiched in between the stories. The authors admit the study is very preliminary."

2,Too much filler and not enough meat...,"I was disappointed with this book on a couple levels. First, I was expecting an ""Event Implementation Manual."" What I found was an exhaustive rehash of the history of not only Kaizen but a good chunk of the industrial revolution, a glossary of largely unrelated terms, about 50 pages of case study exercise, along with some tips and tricks for implementing a kaizen. The 70-some pages related to kaizen events is a good overview for someone familiar with this tool, but not geared for the beginner. The check sheets describing event preparation and follow up were most useful. On another level, I found the obvious lack of the use of an editor or proofreader very distracting. The kaizen event consulting rates listed in the back were the final straw. Stick to Laraia, Moody and Hall's ""The Kaizen Blitz."" <I>This review refers to an earlier edition.</I>"
5,Kaizen Event Implementation Manual,"By far the absolute best book on Kaizen! The simulation is right on target. This is all you need if you want to conduct your own events. Now I won't need some high priced consultant to train our group. We can do it ourselves. Kaizen Sensei Mika is the absolute authority on Kaizen He has also authored the ""Ten Wastes"" and the ""Work Smart Production System."""
5,The bible of Kaizen books,We are a major supplier to Toyota Motor Car Co. and we know a lot about Kaizen; this is the absolute best guide for conducting Kaizen events! It leaves nothing to guess-work. Consistantly using this manual guarantees that each event will be exactly as is should be with nothing forgotten or eliminated. It is like a pilot's preflight check-sheet.The most shop floor oriented Kaizen book in the world!
3,Somewhat Useful ....,"If you've never participated in a Kaizen Event before, this manual does not give you enough information to come anywhere close to conducting one by yourself. There are some basic concepts that this manual leaves out. If you want it as a check list and as a place to get some of the forms, then it's a good tool to have. If you want it as a ""must have"" to conduct a Kaizen Event, then I think you'll be very disappointed. The manual is not bad. ....Also, it didn't look like the manual had been proof read. ...."
5,Incredible;ive been waiting for this for a long time,I have never seen anything this articulated. i disagree with the people who say this is scary. It's just a toy-parents if you have the toy but your child(ren) is afraid tell him or her that it is just a toy. On [another web site] i read that a golum toy wasnt supposed to come out until september-what! september! The voice is great and this actually has replacible batteries. All in all this toy is incredible!
3,"This is Gollum, NOT Sméagol","I wish they would have made a better-looking Gollum figure than this. First of all, this looks more like ET than Gollum. The skin is too white, not gray enough. The eyes look kind of freaky.Like I say, this is Gollum, the mean, Ring-crazed shadow of a being, not Sméagol, the nice creature who serves the master of the Precious and can be kind of cute while ordering his duel-personality, Gollum, to ""leave now and never come back.""Why couldn't we have a (the) cute version of him? Still, if this one is all we have, then you might as well get it. It's so ugly, I don't think I want to."
5,Apollo 8 - To The Moon,"This volume is the one that started the Apogee Books series on the Apollo Program. It contains reproductions of the mission reports, a press kit and many other very important documents detailing man's first journey to another world. A great CD ROM is also included containing videos of the flight. A wonderful volume overall!"
4,The Eye of the Beholder,"I saw this film and recommend it. Like most of the reviewers, I enjoyed it, its sentimental, has some fine actors and gives them a chance to interact around some interesting issues, and its sentimental. Not all reviewers enjoyed it, but I'll get to that. After seeing the movie, I purchased a copy for my dad and step-mom...both in their mid 80s...they liked it too. Those who didn't appreciate it as much may have been put off by the sentimentality, seeing Kirk in the late stage of his career; maybe they don't like Lauren or Dan as much as we do...its a sort of made-for-tv movie for those old enough to appreciate the situation...an odd old jewel in an odd old setting..."
2,A Dissapointment,This movie was really not that good. I was overjoyed to see Kirk Douglas back on screen after his stroke but that is about it.Fans of Kirk Douglas could see this if they really like him but others should seek elsewhere.
2,A sad comedy,"Usually I watch movies to feel good or to be informed --- this one does neither. It made me sad to see Kirk Douglas struggling to sound coherent after his (real-life) stroke. To me, that was not funny for a film that's supposed to be funny.The only bright spot was the appearance of Lauren Bacall who was the sexiest woman on film in the 1940's. She must be in her mid-seventies now, but she is still beautiful and sexy."
3,"Good, but a little repetitive and commercialized","Ashley Jade's CD is very danceable with very bubble-gum high energy, but it gets a little tiresome with a straight listen-through. She is young and her image is a little over-commercialized and her sound slightly generic... but it's fun nonetheless. I recommend not listening to the CD straight through. You'll get bored after song #3, so take it in small increments so you can appreciate and distinguish each song. Her sound is very comparable to Gina G. or Ian Van Dahl (though less trancey). She's got an impressive voice for a 17-year-old and hopefully she'll get stronger with time. A lot of fun and I would love to hear her songs at the club."
3,CATCHY BUT NOTHING SPECIAL,"I purchased this CD after reading reviews that were submitted on Amazon. The music isn't bad, but after listening to the CD about a dozen times, I'm already tired of it. Once in a while, an artist like DJ Taucher or Armin Van Buuren comes along and you can't get enough of their music. Ashley Jade is extremely HOT but her music is just average. I highly recommend anything that Water Music Records puts out. You just have to be careful because there's some garbage out there. My other recommendation is to purchase Trance from Neurodisc Records. You won't be disappointed."
5,Challenging fun for beginners.....,"I have been doing simple crosswords for just over a year now and was looking for the next step up, and this is it. When I first opened the book and saw how large the puzzle blocks were I thought maybe these were going to be too easy, but what a great surprise! Don't let the size of the blocks fool you! The puzzles are fun and as you finish each one the next is a little more challenging. The book is huge and is a great price. A more experienced crossword puzzle may not enjoy as much, but it was just what I was looking for. Definitely Recommend!!"
4,"Nice, but just a word of warning...","I know it says PDA stylus, but for the design I got this for my iPod Touch. It doesn't work with the Apple products apparently. However, the pen itself is nice and compact (I'll still be using it for the writing aspect), and it's not cheaply made (or rather, doesn't have that cheapo feel to it). The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is probably a minor one, but the label just does not come off cleanly. Also, I don't know how it is for PDA's, so I can't say ""it's perfect"". But I hope this review helps a few people at least."
4,Lowe and behold,"Nicely done tribute to the Jesus of Cool. Particularly nice are the contributions from Dave Alvin, Duane Jarvis, Foster & Lloyd, and Don Dixon. I think the fact that artists of this stature and talent elected to contribute here serves as testimony to the reverence Mr. Lowe commands. Not so nice is the contribution from Nick's adopted daughter, Tiffany Anastasia Lowe. She apparently didn't get the singing gene from her mom, Carlene Carter. But enough carping - if you are a Nick Lowe fan (and if you aren't, why not?) you will find much to enjoy here.Amusingly, this disc was recorded for the most part in Costa Mesa, where I live. Would that I was able to witness the proceedings..."
3,"You'll smell exactly like a fresh bouquet of roses...which, actually, wasn't for me, however...","...you might love that. Depends on how much you adore the scent of real rose petals (quality roses, not the seemingly fragrance free cheaper ones).I will say that for me, hands down, the best of the Les BAins Du Marais oils and scents is the MUSC BLANC. Wow, it's such a lovely, gentle, clean, pretty white musk, and I adore musk. But I got the set with the Rose Confiture (soap, gel, oil, scent spray), and despite not having alcohol, the eau de soin really has scent. Unfortunately, it started giving me a headache. It really is a genuinely rose scent, a pure and pretty scent, but it did not agree with my head.I guess I can only take rose scent in smaller doses (like the hint of it in the Musc Blanc).But if you go gaga for roses, unadulterated roses, baby, this is for you."
3,Blue Angels fans must buy this DVD,"I odered this Blue Angels DVD recently, on expecting to get some amazing exclusive close shots of this famous Navy acrobatic team, but failed. Instead of it, I get a 45 min. DVD of the Navy Blue Angels history, since their very first beggining in 1946. I'm not critical about this DVD, it's a nice movie anyway, but; it is not the Blue Angels flying presentation one expect to see, being a ""general"" viewer, not a U.S. Navy aviation fan. There are just few great shots of those bright blue Hornets flying by, but as briefs as a blink of an eye, so you must repeat these scenes, once an again, to enjoy them. John Travolta's narration is fine, as well as music, technically speaking ""sound's great"". If you know someone being a Blue Angels fan, you must tell this is a ""must have"" DVD."
2,YAWN!!!,"I live in El Centro, the winter training grounds of the Blue Angels. I have watched them train from January through March for a good many years. People who buy this DVD are probably expecting to see 45 minutes of air show. Instead, you hear a mumbling narrative by John Travolta which is very much a history of naval aviation, and too little flying. The lead pilot, or ""Boss"" is assigned by the Pentagon, and this video does not point out that the ""Boss"" of this team was removed because of safety violations. The other pilots didn't want to fly with him.The best Blue Angels video I have seen is ""Blue Angels: Xtreme Close-Up"" which aired on the Military Channel. It is pure flying. If you want lots of air show mixed with interesting behind the scenes then I recommendBlue Angels: A Year In The Life. Just don't buy this one unless you want to fall asleep."
3,"A great overview of the Blue Angels' history, tradition and flying manuevers.","Although this video does not contain a solid 45 minutes of flying from their shows, as on reviewer complained, it does cover a lot of the flying manuevers they use which are shown both in practice and in performances. It also provides a very nice overview of the history of the Blue Angels and the tradition that they so faithfully have adhered to since the program's inception in 1946. The price is a bargain and I highly recommend this video for aviation enthusiasts. By the way, they do point out the boss's name of the Blue Angels at the time of filming. His name is Donnie Cochran."
3,Worth watching,"Chii? This series is entertaining and fun to watch, but at times it can be kinda tedious and annoying. Sure, it's full of comedy and funny moments...but some of the episodes I felt were pointless and just there as fillers. Too much focus was put on Chii's adventures and what she learned instead of actually explaining who she was, and where she came from. Most of the important information was crammed into the last few episodes. It was fun watching the first time, but I wouldn't recommend giving it a second go. I still think you should give the dvds a try, but I've heard that the manga (graphic novels) is much better."
5,One word: Great Show (Maybe that was two),"I am not the biggest fan of clamp, but this is one of my favorite series produced by them. I bought the first manga to see what it was about, then I ended up going back the next day to buy the next 6 books.The anime series, as opposed to the manga, is a bit more detailed. (As in you get to see where Hideki comes from.) But, like most anime series, the stories are almost exactly the same as the mangas. Still, it is great for anybody who liked the manga to watch the characters animated. For anybody who has never read the books, this series is still great.-_- I don't know what people are saying about this show being sexist, though. ...Since afterall, Clamp (the makers of the series) is an all-woman team of story-writers."
5,Very Interesting Book!,"I was shocked by the sexual content in the book and can't put this book in my classroom. I didn't notice until I had read it myself after a purchase. I might however read it myself. The way that Japanese views sexuality is rather a surprise but I love Clamp and based on the other reviews, I need to read this series a bit more."
5,A must have for any Macbook,"A coworker suggested I purchase one of these when I bought my Macbook. It is a must for any Macbook. I can't imagine what my Macbook would look like now without using this sleeve.The sleeve is a perfect fit for my Macbook. The sleeve also has a nice color. It provides additional nonabrasive padding, which is a functional purpose of having it in the first place.If you are going to shell out $1300 or more for a Macbook, you might as well spend a little more money to protect it."
5,Wonderful blanket - excellent buy,"I bought several of these blanket for Christmas in different sizes & was very, very pleased. The color is very beautiful & vivid. The blanket feels very light, but keeps you warm. Buy it!! You won't be disappointed."
2,Cat Clutter,"After seeing the cat couch on the cover and reading the blurb which described how to make scratching posts and cat beds, I was really anticipating this book's arrival in my mailbox. I was disappointed to discover that mosts of the craft projects are only barely ""cat crafts""- they don't enhance a cat's life or well-being, they just clutter up a cat lover's house with amateur looking cat-themed items. I was looking at the project photos at a friend's house and two people asked me if one of the polymer clay/yarn cat soft sculptures was a ""cat mummy""- obviously not the goal you're aiming for (unless you're into Egyptian archaeology, I suppose). You won't find anything truly useful in this book as far as cat condos, unique cat toys, etc- just instructions on how to make lampshade covers, puff paint decorated spray bottles, and cat mummy sculptures."
1,"Crafts for Your Young Children, Not for Adults","I ordered this book under the assumption that I was getting a book to help me find new ways to entertain my cats. Boy, was I wrong. Most of the crafts include painting litter boxes, creating play houses out of cardboard (that would last 5 seconds in my household), and even human food recipes. Please do not think you're going to entertain your cat with this book (unless he gets to sit on it while you try to read it...that's about as much fun as he/she will get out of it). This book is mainly for people who are terribly bored or are in need of something to entertain their children."
4,Beautiful Sounds.,"This CD is one of the best from Los Indios Trabajaras. While their music is not known by younger people, their astonishing guitar music came to my attention forty years ago, and it has endured ever since.Fortunately, CD's are now available to replace the LP's I used to have, and I can once again listen to true masters of the classical guitar, playing in a style unlike any other."
1,don't buy from this company,what you order is not what you received. they are selling products that have been discontinued over a year ago. their customer service is the worst because i've emailed them about what they have sent me and up to thins day haven't received a reply. this christian dior 500 is not what you are going to get. what you are going to get is the 700 which is extremely dark. do not buy from this supplier!!!
2,Beware,"2 stars for being misleading.Do not buy this book if you are looking for practices and techniques for ""Everyday Mind Reading."" I saw the title and read the ""look inside"" option amazon gives you. It was extremely interesting(about the life of Richard Burton) but that's about it.The book is good for reading about results of experiments and theories. But no everyday practice...you have been warned."
1,Very boring and full of unuseful information,"It is full of unuseful information. Seems like if the author just wanted to fill pages with information that nobody really cares about to justify the printing of his book. This book feels like if you're reading a college work paper where the student want to impress the teacher with a very long paper but without any real conclusions. I think you can summarize this book in no more than 4 pages. One of the conclusions will be: ""good friends can read their feelings/emotions better than strangers"". Do you really need to read how a ""scientific"" experiment was done to get to that conclusion?"
3,Solid Counsel - but...,"I love Jack's strategic perspective. More CEO's and Marketing Executives should heed it. My personal disappointment with this book is it was in some cases, a word for word, cut-paste from his previous work. Maybe it's good he's put his previous works into an abreviated single book. But, personally, I expected new thinking. I regularly re-read some of his older books, so I didn't need to pay for the repetition. That leaves me wondering how to rate it. The content is a 5. But it's the same content I've already paid for in other books, so I have to knock a few stars off."
3,Warmed over soup?,"Trout presents the subject in a readable and interesting manner with good examples. However, the book may be described as Intro to Business Strategy 100 for the beginner. And, if you've read some of Trout's or Ries' prior works, you won't find much new here."
4,Recommendation,"My recommendation goes both ways. Over all the book is really good and I would definitely recommend it to people. It would be a good book for people that do not have much knowledge about marketing strategy and they would gain a lot by reading this book. On the other hand, I would not recommend it to someone who has already read quite a few of Jack Trout's books before. This book seems to sum up a lot of what he has to say in his other books. In fact, this book almost seems like it is trying to sell other books that he has written in the past. So if you have already gathered quite a bit of knowledge from Jack Trout, this book could be very repetitive to you."
4,Straigh to the point,Jack Trout definitely touched on specific areas of marketing that are often misunderstood by society. This was an easy read book. And I recommend it for anyone interested in Marketing or starting a business one day.
3,Does not Disappoint,"""A great business strategy without proper marketing will often fail in a highly competitive world."" This is in the first few pages of Trout's book and lays the groundwork for the rest of the chapters. Trout is a prolific writer, and certainly is the father of modern day branding. Over the years, his books have always had one or two nuggets with which you can walk away, and this book does not disappoint. If you are a marketer, and having difficulty getting senior management to green-light a new marketing initiative, this is a great book to read as you work towards forming your argument for the boardroom. While you won't find a lot of cutting-edge information, I do recommend this book for the reaffirmation of some simple `marketing as strategy' techniques."
4,"Of course it's great,,,,It's Trout","Although much of the info here has been covered in other Trout books, this doesn't detract from Trout's precise and cutting vision! In fact for me it enhances it because you can see that in a sea of ""What to do"" books, Trout remains consistant in his beliefs. A must have!"
4,Understands the mind of the consumer,"Trout again does a good job of identifying key strategical concepts. He uses his vast knowledge of brands and their effect on the consumers ability to choose. If you need help formluting a better strategy for your company, I suggest checking this out."
3,Useful book but only a page or two on Mold.,Useful book but only a page or two on Mold. The book name would lead one to assume that this book has an emphasis on Mold and Water damage claims. But there is not much in there on mold and water damage. Mostly there is general information. I found the book informative never the less.
5,What a joy to find a book I've searched for for forty years!,This book belonged to my elementary school library and I used to get scolded by the librarian for checking it out so often! As an adult I have searched EVERYWHERE for it. Bless the internet and Amazon Books! I had nearly lost hope! Now my five (so far) grandchilden can get lost in the same magical world I have never forgotten. Garth Williams' illustrations are as vivid in my mind as when I was a little girl (especially the old fisherman and the baby mermaid!) Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
5,What a joy to find this book again!,"I received this book for Christmas in 1955 and it has always been my favorite- the illustrations are so beautiful! I was sure that elves and fairies were dancing in the backyard at night. I have carefully guarded my somewhat deteriorated copy ever since. Last year, after my new neice arrived, I so wanted to find a copy of this book- but the best I could find on-line was a price of $300 for used 1951 version. What a joy to find it re-released. I've ordered 5 more copies. If you have young children- you must see what I (and all these other reviewers) loved so very much."
5,"Knowing Fairies Personally, This Book Rings True","This is called a treasury for good reason...wonderful stories and poems and the enchanting art of Garth Williams truly are treasures. This book has sprinkled magic about for over 50 years. My Nana gave this book to me when I was 7 years old and hungry for information and pictures of my beloved fairies. So many books miss the mark when they depict the fairies but in this one they must have willingly posed because they knew the artist was one of the Good Folk himself! Mr. Williams is also a kissin' cousin to mermaids, witches, pixies, and leprechauns and happily introduces you to the family. This book disappeared for many years and is around now so I strongly suggest you buy a copy while you can. It's a rare and magical treat."
5,An old friend comes home,"I thought I was the only person in the world who knew about this book. I grew up with a battered, coverless, copy of The Giant Golden Book of Elves and Fairies that I lost about 10 years ago. Until today, I didn't even know the name of the book. Without even a title, author or publication date, I set off years ago in search of the best children's book I have ever read I can remember the pictures and stories so well and wanted to share them with my daughters. When I read Jay Rudin's review, I knew I had found my old friend. I cannot recommend this book highly enough."
4,A little too tight for a chest pack.,"The pack visually looks bigger in the pictures. However, it seems very durable and has ample room for small hand tools. I haven't used it for work yet, but I plan on using the holster arrangement. I'm 5'9, 150 and the chest pack was too tight on me! I loosened the straps as much as possible but the pack when filled with tools would be just a couple inches below my chin. Thus the 4/5 stars."
2,so not sure what people are loving about this soundtrack,"I got this because I wanted more of the brief moments when Sean is supposedly playing old style soulful jazz. I was falsely encouraged by the posts that said this CD was all this great jazz. This CD is much more a completely uniform sounding symphonic soundtrack. Yes there are elements of tempo, prominent bass, and some other elements not characteristic of symphonic music, but there's literally only a minute of the jazz ensemble and maybe another minute female jazz vocals.As a mostly ambient, not annoying soundtrack, it is a fine CD, but do not buy it for the great jazz scenes in the movie."
4,Da!,"With the combined talents of Jerry Goldsmith, Alan and Marilyn Bergman, Wynton Marsalis and Patti Austin, this is a jazzy class-act from beginning to end. A great soundtrack CD from an unlikely movie. (And, if you like it, you may want to check out the soundtracks to ""Siesta"" and ""Afterglow"".) Enjoy."
5,Russia House,"though the music written for this film is certainly not on par with the scores of such films as casablanca, i do agree that we shouldn't judge goldsmith's score solely on the basis of it's quality as a stand alone piece.goldsmith's score is poignant, and it captures the bleak romanticism that is imbued in all aspects of russian life. as i happened to spend much time in moscow, i'd say that this score, in conjunction with schepisi's stolid cinematography, does a remarkable job transporting me back to that world.the music in all of the ""cia/spy"" scenes (mostly taking place in washington, london, lisbon, and leningrad) are a little corn ball. but i do not think these sections of music distract from the scenes themselves.all things being said, i love this movie. i am obsessed with this film. and the music, however good or corny, does stick in a good way."
2,Strange,"Were we supposed to root for this dysfunctional family against Family Services? Those kids are messed up for life. The movie is visually appealing, but nothing more."
1,Only a Man with a Heart of Stone...,"My wife and I watched this, and laughed helplessly for the last fifteen minutes. The basic premise is so goofy, the actors so solemn, the whole approach so politically correct that it reminded me of Oscar Wilde's comment on the death of Dickens' ""Little Nell"": ""Only a man with a heart of stone could read it without laughing.""The ""funeral"" scene in particular left us in stitches. I only regret that the wife didn't look up into her husband's eyes and say, ""I'm pregnant. And I think this one will be invisible, too."""
2,Rididulous but Hilarious,"If you're bored and in need of a hearty laugh by all means, watch Invisible Child where a mother of two creates a third child (Maggie) for some obscure reason. The movie is devoted to watching this nutcase interact with thin air with the aid of her other daughter and husband. With no set up or backstory, you're immediately thrust into this family who has been dealing with mom's issue for about five years already. This movie is totally illogical and I suppose would be touching if it wasn't so absurd. There are SO many entertaining parts of this movie however. Anytime that the mother is out in public with her ""child"" is a riot. I don't know what would possess anyone to be a part of this film. I had to give it two stars just because it's so hilarious."
4,Interesting movie,"It was really interesting to see my favorite actor, Victor Garber, in this movie. He plays a married man who has two children. Well, three, if you count the invisible middle daughter (age 5) his wife has created. Their son, who's younger (4) really believes he has an invisible sister. The older daughter, who's maybe 8-10ish, and father play along with it.The mother hires a nanny, who's kinda freaked out by this invisible child thing, but goes along with it. She's concerned about the effect this is having on the other children and talks to a psychiatrist. He refers her to social services, and she, being British, doesn't know what they do. When she hears that the kids might be taken away, she panics and leaves.Meanwhile, the invisible daughter keeps getting sick and the social services lady is paying them visits.Will she take the kids away? Watch this fun movie to find out. :-)"
3,Hmmm....,"This movie was kind of messed with my head. The main characters are a family of four and their nanny - problem is that Mom has created a 3rd child - in her head.The entire movie revolves around the family's desire to apease mom in the psychotic delusions. It will really mess with your head to watch this unfold on screen.The acting is great, but the content is disturbing."
4,"Great acting, crazy plot","I watched this movie because I'm a Victor Garber fan. He does not disappoint. However, I found this film to be extremely disturbing. Rita Wilson's character belonged in a mental institution. I expected her to get the help she needed but that didn't happen. Instead, they all went along with her fantasy. The fake funeral was the most disturbing scene. Did they really think Maggie's ""death"" would solve the problem? Crazy. Still, I give it 4 stars for the superb acting."
3,"'Psychedelic Moods,Vol.2':Various Artists' (Collectables)","Not bad for a various artist CD of a bunch of psych and garage bands that virtually no one has ever even heard of.The tracks that I liked the best were the six cuts by the obscure NYC band Hydro Pyro,with their bag of goodies,""House Of Yesterday"",""Id"",their namesake ""Hydro Pyro"" plus three others,Fallen Angels,contributing a Love cover ""Signed D.C."" and the two songs by Superfine Dandelion,""The Other Sidewalk"" and ""Ferris Wheel"".Worth repeated plays,for at least a little while.Worth checking out."
3,Disjointed,"I'm having a hard time with this book. I'm nearly finished with it. I guess I ""can't see the forest for the trees"", so-to-speak. I'm not sure if this is the subject matter or Carter's presentation of it. However, in retrospect, I find reading Moore and Bruder's chapters on Metaphysics (in Philosophy: The Power of Ideas) much clearer. I don't dissuade a reader from this book; I only caution that I didn't find the book a model of clarity and organization."
1,Unsophisticated,"If you have any reasonable background in philosophy (and I do mean any) I implore you to avoid reading this book. It does not do justice to a single position it attempts to explain (even the positions that Carter claims to support). I would like to think that it is due to the brevity with which Carter approaches each subject, but some passages are just inexplicably absurd. At best, the book can be considered a crude introduction to a few of the major problems of metaphysics, but don't expect to find any gems of reasoning. I sincerely hope that nobody who reads this book comes away with the conclusion that this is how philosophy is conducted."
4,"Solid mature Morse, sublime moments, consistent craftmanship","Morse is a giant in guitar performance and instrumental composition, and a long-time Gallery of the Greats resident in Guitar Player Magazine's readership rankings. This album is securely in his recent tradition, tending more to the electric side of things with tunes like ""Arena Rock"", ""Weekend Overdrive"", ""Cut to the Chase"", Sleaze Factor"" and the title tune, ""Southern Steel"". ""Simple Simon"" and ""Arena Rock"" have deep-diving hooks that settle into memory, and the title tune can still pull a tear out of me. Morse is a master of ""leave 'em wanting more"", by building a tune with progressive harmonies and counterpoint into a symphonic crescendo and just as it's at the transcendent blend, fading the song out. My test for an album is how many times I can play it in obsessive succession, over and over, before I'm sick of it. I'm still spinning this one."
5,"His Best, Y'all","It's a Southern thing, I reckon; I'm running out of title ideas, obviously. But it is his best, regardless of my lame title; From the trading solos on 'Cut to the Chase' w/Jeff Watson to incredibly solid, intricate bass and drumwork, this is a CD filled with accomplished playing on all levels; The songs are filled with surprising turns, and are actually great songs without being overly long. Morse is a master of various styles, and this will give you a sampling of nearly all of them on what I consider his best solo work. And that was a hard choice to make."
1,Lousy CD,Hap Palmer's Turn on the Music CD should be turned off. The music was awful. I would not recommend this CD.
4,Series 3 Dragons: Eternal Clan 3,"This is a marvelous Dragon, an almost perfect Green D&D; dragon on a very detailed nest. It also comes with a just hatched baby dragon that is a seperate figure.On the down side, it does have limited articulation and the pegs in the feet basically require it to be mounted on it's nest, but still it is a great figure."
3,uneven sequel to the original Japanese 'The Ring',"The movie 'The Ring' was based on a novel by Koji Suzuki, the first book of a trilogy. The books of the trilogy are Ring, Spiral, and Loop. The movie is a sequel to 'The Ring', based on the second book. It was not particularly successful...it goes off in unexpected directions with different characters than the first film. So the Japanese eventually made another sequel called 'The Ring 2', which was more like the sequel which was made a couple of years later in the US. Still, this movie is worth seeing if you enjoy Japanese horror movies, or if you just want to compare it to the book. The books have been translated into English, by the way, and are also available here on Amazon."
3,An uneven but worthwhile mix of Early Elfman.,"Danny Elfman is one of the better film composers working today. This collection, featuring film and tv themes from 1980 through 1990 shows us some of the growing pains he had to go through to get there. At his best when collaborating with director Tim Burton, it is tracks from their films which stand out (PEE WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE, BATMAN, AND BEETLEJUICE). Other fine examples of Elfman's distinct style include themes from BIG TOP PEE WEE, THE SIMPSONS, TALES FROM THE CRYPT, and SCROOGED. The rest of the album, though less successful, is still an interesting glimpse of an artist working to find his voice. Overall, a better than average collection well worth the budget price."
4,Great sampler for a modern-day film composer,"Elfman may eventually ascend to the heights of Herrmann, Goldsmith, or Williams because he is one of the most consistent and gifted film composers on the contemporary scene. This first compilation of late 80's - early 90's themes shows his talent for composing the right music for the films/television shows for which he was hired. As diverse and musically warped as some of the Tim Burton films of which Elfman's music is most associated, ""Darkened"" is a necessary album for fans of film music."
3,Classics mixed with mediocrity,"I am, without a doubt, a complete Danny Elfman fan. Thanks toTim Burton movies, I've been introduced to Elfman's exuberant and off-beat style. While this album is great, I don't think it captures the full magic of Danny Elfman music. My favorites on this album are the Nightbreed theme, Pee Wee's Playhouse theme, Tales from the Crypt, Beetlejuice, and the Scrooged theme. These songs are undoubtedly legendary classics that I love, which is why I'm prompted to give this album a rating of 3. However, the mediocrity of the rest of the album somewhat slices the edge of this Elfman collection. It includes his older work near the beginning of his career, and while there's nothing wrong with that, I prefer his Tim Burton film work. If you're a Danny Elfman fan, this album is worth the purchase for the classics I listed."
4,A Danny Elfman fan must have!,"Essential Danny Elfman (Singer and founder of ""Oingo Boingo"")compositions from his early film sound-track work. It's all here and great stuff to put on for your haunted house or Halloween party! Elfman's obsession with the dead comes through throughout!"
5,I think it's pretty cool stuff,"We listened to this CD at a barbeque! An odd place to listen to it, but it worked just fine! I liked it! I should buy it! Sometime."
5,Spiked Collar,"I bought this collar for my daughter's new car - she was calling the car ""Spike"". The seller wrote me an email before she sent the product, telling me that I had ordered a pink collar, as the black ones were gone. I appreciated the seller's email very much. I would do business with the seller again."
5,Bosch Icon Wiper,The Icon are the best wiper blade I've used. My son was so happy with his I had to try them. Very Happy!
1,broke after 3 months,I'm goiong to keep this short.... don't buy this brand of wiper. Save your money. Buy a meadium price wiper and replace it every few years.
2,A vechicle with one wiper?,"When reading the description of this product, it states ""blades""....""s"" as in more than one. BEWARE!!!!!! This is only one blade,and I just don't know of two many cars or trucks that have only one wiper blade. What a rip-off."
1,Not Worth It!!,"I finally decided to put good windshield wipers on my Toyota, right before Monsoon season hits, here in AZ. I used them once to clean the windows 2 wks. ago. I just got back from having my car checked out during a routine service..and they informed me, that the wipers need to be replaced, since mine apparently had already started to rip away! Before I purchased these, I had read all these reviews..and let me tell you, you're all full of it!! Thanks for making this single Mom, throw hard-earned money away!"
2,Quality,NOt expectedthe quality from Bosch was no different than other popular brandswas more costlyIt started streaking after a month
2,Great for about three weeks,"I installed a set of these Bosch ICON wiper blades on my 2005 Subaru Outback in late 2011, so I would have new wiper blades as winter settled in to the northeast. At first, I was quite pleased at how well they worked. However, after about three weeks, the driver's side blade started leaving a streak right in my line of vision. Despite cleaning them, the streak remained and has progressively become worse. These blades are now barely three months old and badly need to be replaced. Normally, this would not be terrible performance for winter in New Jersey, except for the fact that it has snowed exactly ONCE since I installed the wiper blades on the car, there has been below-average precipitation this winter, and I park the car in the garage at night and on weekends. The crappy ANCO blades that I can get from the supermarket perform almost as good as these when new, and last much longer before they need to be replaced. I'm not buying these again."
5,Best Blades Ever Owned,I bought myself a set about a year ago and they have been the best blades I ever owned. I got this set for my dad. I'm sure he will love them.
4,Pretty impressive,"I've had mine for about 3 months now and they seem to be going strong and very effective. The icons do seem to out preform the Rain X Weatherbeatera on my Tacoma, but time will tell."
2,Worn Out After Only 3 Months,I bought a pair of these Bosch wiper blades for my 2010 Ford Fusion and they are pretty much shot at 3 months. This blade leaves streaks and smears on most of the driver's side which I think is due to the length of this blade. This happens even though I clean the windshield and blades often. The shorter passenger side seems to wipe better but is still not great. The driver's side blade has now developed a nick in the blade resulting in a bead of water that is never removed from my field of vision. I actully put the original blades back on and they perform better than the Bosch blades ever did. I recommend not buying these blades.
2,Overrated,"After thorough research I bought these in late 2009 to replace stock blades on a 2006 Honda Pilot. They worked well for about 3 months and then started streaking and skipping (very annoying on long drives). The stock blades worked much better. I am now replacing and would not recommend this Bosch ICON model for any SUV.UPDATED Review - June 3, 2011. In my original comment on these Bosch ICON blades, I was generous awarding 2 stars. I finally replaced these blades in April 2011 with Good Year Assurance blades, and I am sad that it took me so long to do so. With the Bosch blades I cringed every time it rained as they were very streaky and failed to remove water from the wind screen. I had to constantly adjust my seated position so I could see the road through the streaks. These new Good Year blades made a 'day and night' difference."
2,Hard to See,"I have these on my Acura, and where they actually meet the windshield, they work well. However, over the driver's side, they apparently don't meet the windshield. So when I drive in rain/snow, they usuaaly wipe away the water on the up-stroke, but then gap on the downstroke. That leaves a nice 4-5 inch area of water directly in my line of sight. Also, when I put them back down after cleaning the windsheild, a piece popped off the passenger side wiper and wouldn't go back on again. So, that wiper then started to not meet the windshield. Check to make sure these meet your whole windshield before purchasing."
4,Shows Y Guy is said to be Best Male Performer in Aust,"Heard that recently, seen him live and now agree with that judgment.Just As I Am is funky, pop/urban and his arrangements 1st class. This man is a musician, thru and thru. I had his 2nd album by chance and got sold on him bigtime so chased up his older stuff. What a find... This is what a comp. should be about - finding a true artist, a credible musician and something special.Australia knows class when it finds it. Oh, and there are about 50 other songs on cds out there with Guy there. Enjoy."
2,TRUE BLUE DISSAPOINTMENT,"This album is trash. I am not happy that he represents my country. This album all sounds the same, a slow boring album, when tires to get fast it miserablly fails. This has so much bad lyrics and sounds that shouldnt be included. Although i admit he has a great voice this album is just bad(no wonder why it took a matter of days to make it). Save your money or if you like one song buy that one because the album sounds all the same. A DEFINATE DONT BUY. In a word: Dull."
2,not so wonderful,"Sure, this album was recorded in 6 (?) days, but it's not even impressive for that. I watched Australian idol and some of Guy's performances (such as ""climb ev'ry mountain"" and ""(everything i do) i do it for you"") were really excellent. So i figured there'd be some decent stuff on his debut album.Well i think i was very wrong.The only songs i can say i like are ""all i need is you"" and possibly ""what a wonderful world"", the other songs are just boring. His voice never really takes off in any of them except singing a couple of high notes in some. The album is full of corny ballads and a dash of RnB here and there.If you are interested in buying this album, i wouldnt buy it for full price because you'll probably be disappointed. I got it cheap so it wouldnt bother me if i didn't like it."
1,Disappointed,"I spent so much on getting this album but I have to admit to being really disappointed. There is something that really grates about this guy's voice. He has quite a nasal sound when he is not singing high in the back of his throat and straining and that together with all the frills and trills makes many tracks sound really oversung and strained.He actually sounds offkey in parts of 3 words and All I need is you and a few other tracks that I haven't bothered to note and while I have read here that he recorded it in just a few days, that surely should have been fixed.There are a couple of upbeat tracks, but most are pretty slow, and just not interesting enough."
4,very good singer but...,"Guy is a good singer and I enjoyed the CD. It seems true that he doesnt write much. The best song on the CD to me is NO ONE COMPARES (to you). I have actualy heard this song before in America by another artist, blueeyedsoul.com I like the American singer version (who actually wrote the song) version much better, but guy did a great job. I think if guy stays with this style of song he will do well. I would buy his next cd just to see if he has another song this good."
1,The answer is no.,What we have here is a terminal case of Popia Genericus. Guy Sebastian tries very hard not to stand out or do anything even remotely interesting on the whole record. A disappointing release from a disappointing artist.
4,Idol rushed this album far to much.,"Guy Sebastian has an excellent voice which never ceases to amaze. While the songs on this album are easily forgettable I doubt that another artist could have done a better job of them. He was only given six days to record this album so it's not great. If you're in love with his voice I recommend you buy this album as it is an excellent show case of this. However, if you're expecting excellent song choices that showcase his personality, wait for his next album which is due for release in October 2004. While this is a good album it isn't excellent and could have been much better if it hadn't been so rushed."
5,"Well done, Guy!","I was very surprised and happy when Guy won Australian Idol because I like him so much. He has a beautiful voice, great style and a real presence about him. My favourites on this album are So I, Can You Stand The Rain, My Beautiful Friend, All I Need Is You and his covers of When Doves Cry and What A Wonderful World. I don't really like the single they chose for him, he sounds great but the song lyrics and the whole song just seem... well, I suppose it was designed to be a manufactured pop hit and that's what it is. The album is nothing like that song and I love that Guy was allowed to write some of these songs, I anticipate his next album where he'll hopefully have even more control.It's a very funky and upbeat album, it cheers me up and proves that Guy will not be a one hit wonder, he has something special."
5,Guy Sebastian,"Guy Sebastian is a great singer, said to have the voice of an angle. He should be better known around the world and may be at the height of his career after and during WORLD IDOL."
4,Great CD,"I really like this CD. There are two songs that I find I usually skip through, but not cause they're terrible -- just not my style, I guess. I even listen to this CD while doing cardio at the gym. It's a little slow for cardio, I'll admit, but I enjoy it anyway. One day, while doing cardio, I actually listened carefully to the words of ""My Beautiful Friend"", and started crying!!! Thank goodness my tears mixed in with my sweat, or people would have thought I was a freak!"
4,Angels brought him here,"Australian Idol Guy Sebastian was virtually crowned in the 60's special with his moving reindition of ""Climb Evry Mountain"". This was the defining moment of the competition, finally someone connected with a crowd and with home veiwers so powerfully that even thoughs who never liked him before stood up and took notice. He was born with a gift and this no one can deny even if they try too they are likely to be shunned just as the bad reviews of this album should be. Il admit Guy is above this album but if he recorded an album worthy of his name there may never be enough stars to rate it with. Just as Iam begins with Angels Brought Me here which is Australias highest selling single and Australias quickest sellin g single of all time. This song perfectly alliterates his idol journey. Other favourites are ""all i need is you"" ""when doves cry"" ""Just as Iam"" and ""3 words"" get it. soon guys next album wiolll be out, recorded with brian mcknight, thicke , joe and cutfather"
2,Disappointing,"I was so impressed with Guy's World Idol performance, and anxiously awaited receiving his album, which came this week. What a letdown! It fails to use his talent and vocal range to good effect. I'd describe it as bland pseudo-funk, with too much sameness and too little energy and variety. The only really good cut was the cover of Prince's 'When Doves Cry'. Guy deserves better - perhaps next time more time will be taken to produce a quality album that is worthy of his talent."
3,A promising start,"After winning Australian Idol, Guy Sebastian has become a huge success in this country and rightly so. His debut album, churned out in just 6 days is a promising start to what will hopefully be a long career. After releasing the single 'Angels Brought Me Here', I was glad to hear some more upbeat, funky tracks on the album even if the production comes off a little light. Three of the best tracks are the ones he co-wrote ('All I Need', 'Something Don't Feel Right', 'I 4 u), and his cover of 'When Doves Cry' certainly showcases his vocal abilities.This album is a bit like Guy himself - a grower. It takes a few listens before you get used to his style, and his neverending upbeat, positive attitude toward life. If you like your music with edge and attitude then this is not the album for you but if you appreciate a truely beautiful, unique voice and can see potential in a talented artist, I'd definitely reccomend it."
1,Disappointing,"I am allergic to latex, so I have been searching for a swim cap that would provide the protection to my hair similar to the nicely fitting latex caps. This cap had a number of nice reviews, so I took a chance. First, the color was not a pictured on the site. Next, the cap does fit over your head easily so it doesn't catch your hair but it is not a very secure fit. Save your money, choose another product."
1,Size not accurate,"I have been using the Latex/Lycra and thought I would try this one, not a good plan. The size was much smaller than indicated and was not comfortable for my swim."
4,Nice for a first swim cap,"Fit my head fine, including all of my hair (I have long, thick hair). The only thing is that it does let a bit of water in, so after 30 minutes my hair was pretty damp, but not soaked. Didn't bother me too much."
2,Doesn't keep your hair dry.,I wish I could return this item but bought it through swim2000. Stick with the basic speedo silicon cap.
1,All Colors are BLACK,"Somehow if you select this product with ANY color the item added to cart is of BLACK color, I wanted to buy a white cap ended up getting BLACK, BEWARE!!!!. it is either an amazon bug or vendor is messing up."
2,Wet Hair,"Yes it does go and come off your head easier than most swim caps, but it doesn't keep your hair dry at all."
2,not waterproof,"The cap is comfortable and seems to fit well but when I am done with my swim, my hair is damp underneath. I prefer the way it feels to my other silicon swim cap but its not keeping my hair dry so not doing the job."
3,Very very very tight,"Rather attractive swim cap, if such a thing is possible. The silver makes the pink look less girly and more sporty. The pink, incidently, is HOT pink, not petal pink as shown.Still, I cannot believe this is actually a L/XL. I'm a L, and it was so tight I wanted to cry. Returning it for a refund."
4,Very comfortable,"My wife is pleased with the comparative ease of donning this cap. Ordinary caps were a real problem in that regard. Only drawback, and I guess it goes along with a more comfortable fit, is some leakage around the ears."
4,"It sure holds hair, but still makes them wet.","The cap sure does hold your hair and avoids going into your eyes. However, after a swim, the hair are still wet. Not as wet as they might have been without the cap. Also, I don't have any problem with hair getting wet. Just that I was expecting them to keep hair dry. That's the only reason I have rated this cap as a 4-star."
1,size issue,The size ordered was medium however was too small for me. Make sure the size is right when you order
4,"Great buy, great value","Digital cameras can be very expensive but if you are looking for great value for money and are an novice looking for a""snapshot"" type digital camera which is both suitable for home use or in the business world where you need to take shots of equipment etc. Then you wont beat the Epson Photo PC650, it has many usefull features such as the ability to choose between four pixel settings, playback on the built in LCD can be either groups of nine or one at a time. When downloaded via either a TV or PC the quality is unquestionable for a camera of this price. I have been delighted with the results, which are even better than some makes costing much more. The size of this unit is small enough to fit into your pocket or briefcase. A great buy."
2,Easy to use but reliability poor,"As a decidedly ""non-computer"" person, I found this camera very easy to use. I was satisfied , but not thrilled, with the picture quality, compared to my brother's digital at less than half the price. Since I had purchased the camera through Apple along with my iMac, I would have expected it to have come with a JumpShots cable compatible with the iMac. Luckily I did not go out and purchase one, as the camera did not hold up well for the relatively limited use it got. Rather than spend who know how much on repair, I am now in the market for a (non-Epson) replacement."
2,A disappointment...,"I have enjoyed my other Epson products, and was looking forward to using this camera. Unfortunately, it has been a headache from day one. The jumpshot reader is a weak link, in my opinion. I would rather have the camera usb plug into my iMac directly. The fillm disc was defective, and it took months of long distance calls to Lexar to finally resolve the problem. I will be looking for another brand of camera to replace this one. No more Epson."
1,Product breaks often - Epson RMA's take forever,"Camera is good, takes decent pictures... When it works! I have had this camera for 8 months, and have had to ship it to Epson to have it repaired twice. Epson has had my camera more than I have. 1st problem the camera displayed purple lines all over the LCD screen, this took over a month to get it back! The second problem is the flash, It has been a month now, still no camera! However Epson promises 2 weeks! No way to contact Epson except via long distance phone numbers.I will never purchase another Epson product again..."
1,Look For other Sights,What the manufacture wont tell you about these sights . once installed to adjust or remove the sights for any gunsmith work - will in fact destroy them . The sur-lok 1262 solution used' to install the sights require heat to melt the bound between the slide and the sight . That much heat kills the tritium vial . Not making this up . I contacted their support and that's the answer I received .
1,Over Hypped Junk,I installed the XS on my Glock 23 and shot 100 rounds today to find that the elevation is 6' low at 10 feet and over a foot low at 12'. The Warren sights I removed were accurate. The elevation cannot be adjusted on the XS. They are relatively cheap for a night sight and now I know why. The guy shooting 100 yards on You Tube with XS sights wasn't shooting this crap.
5,Listened to this CD for 12 years...and it's still haunting,"This is one of the oldest CDs in my collection...it was soothing enough to help me sleep when I had a spell of insomnia back in the mid 1990's. =)Not that it would put you asleep if you were wide awake...it's not the Carpenters. It's a dark and poignant CD outside of the Tom Jones song (which I never listen to.) It was a great soundtrack by the movie of the same name, which I loved, and is still sampled (often) for holiday commercials.I barely remember Danny Elfman from Oingo Boingo, so I'm not one of his big fans, but know he usually does soundtracks to Tim Burton films...watch a lot of movies. I have to agree with the others...this must the best soundtrack he has ever produced, at least from the films I saw in which he did the soundtrack."
5,Edward Scissorhands,This is an awesome soundtrack. It's fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this soundtrack are all of them. if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do
5,WOW!,This is truly a masterpiece. The music is haunting yet I cant stop listening to it. It is as touching as the movie is. It brings tears to my eyes and i am only 13.
4,Wintery Wonder,"All I can say is I wish I were snowed under with a hot cup of cocoa while listening to this soundtrack and maybe later watching the movie.The boy's choir ads so much to this soundtrack and the familiar theme they sing runs throughout the score giving the entire album a common thread. The addition of Tom Jones' ""With these Hands"" could have been omitted though. That song throws of the integrity of Elfman's fantastic score.I can listen to this one over and over."
3,Mellow and ethereal,"Danny Elfman is just amazing - once again he has created a whole world within this soundtrack. Much of the music is somewhat haunting, yet oddly relaxing. Great for background music or reading!"
4,enchanting fairytale music,"This soundtrack has some of the most beautiful choral music, and produces the right fairytale atmosphere for ""Edward Scissorhands"".David Rehakauthor of ""A Young Girl's Crimes"""
2,Mundane,"Ok, I bought this based on the reviews and a couple of songs that I heard on the radio.One word. Mundane. Don't bother."
1,got to be there,... {AVOID IT} the only reason that i give it one star is cause the main theme is acceptable but thats all after hearing it one time it stinks to.
5,A Gorgeous Soundtrack,"Absolutely enchanting, haunting, and mesmerizing. Takes you out of reality for awhile.I remember after seeing the movie, the first thing I wanted to do was buy the soundtrack. And I've listened to it repeatedly and not grown tired of it.Arguably Elfman's best work."
5,"Beautiful simple design, good lighting","I wanted a chandelier that I could use in our dining room/kitchen when we lost power, which last year seems like it was quite often for long periods. I had my mom order this for me during hurricane Irene without ever actually seeing it myself until it arrived. I love it. It is such a simple elegant design, easily hung and emits a good amount of light from the four candles. Not only is it functional and well crafted but the price was affordable."
5,"Colorful, simple, Great.","This caught the attention of our son who loves trains. I thought at first it was long and boring but he totally loves this dvd, especially regarding the alphabet train."
1,Just Terrible,"CD Player doesn't work.Radio has awful reception.Sound is ""Tinny"".Didn't seem to work with batteries, must remain plugged in.Aux In works, but volume is super low. Need to crank it up to hear anything. God help you if you then switch to radio afterwards without first lowering the volume.Does a good job with the iPod, but again the sound itself is ""Tinny"".I highly recommend against this product, and will never purchase another product by this manufacturer."
3,Worked well....for 6 months,"We liked the product. Volume was ok, had ipod, radio, aux input, and cd player. Fairly lightweight and portable. Remote was nice too.Then one day, it just stopped working mid-song. The radio thinks it's playing but no sound comes out for ANY of the sources (ipod, radio, cd). And of course the warranty has expired."
1,Mr. Los,"This book by Jack Ashford was very limited in its inside peek behind the scenes at Motown. I was more interested in the actual recording sessions themselves and what took place. What I got were constant, annoying comparisons between Motown and basketball teams. I wish there would have been more meat to this book.I did enjoy reading about the musicians themselves. Need more."
1,Misleading,"First off the title and cover are misleading because the Cameron's didn't really sail Magnus down the Atlantic coast, they drove it, not unlike an old Range Rover driving down I-95. A major reoccurring theme throughout the book is getting Leo (aka BFD), their self proclaimed old lumpy dog, ashore every 10 - 12 hours to relieve himself. If that doesn't stir your excitement the book is full of local yarns that would put even the characters they were about to sleep. If you're looking for a book about a sailing adventure do yourself a favor and keep looking."
3,Easy reading.,"But I still find fishing mysterious. Would love if there were some charts to help choose the right sized hook, line, and weight for the situation, and what to change when they are not biting or when they are getting the bait but not getting hooked. Maybe someday I will catch a fish until then I will just enjoy the scenery and not take it too serious."
5,Fun How to Book for both new and experience anglers.,"My two youngest sons have discovered fishing and I bought this book as a fun how to look at everything they need to enjoy their new sport. The book has the basics for everyone presented in the fun yet serious about the subject books the 'Dummies' series is known for. As with all the Dummies books there is a humorous cartoon at the start of each chapter.The book has a section on where to fish. How to be safe while fishing. What kind of fish there are to catch and where.There is a section on rods, reels, and tackle. Advice on what type of line to use for what purpose. What kind of hooks to get and lures to buy.A section on different fresh water and saltwater fishes and their behaviors. Plus a color section that matches fishes and lures that are good to use in catching them.Fishing for Dummies is a great tool for the new Angler and even seasoned veterans can find new tricks from Peter Kaminsky and Greg Schwipps."
2,A big waist of money!,This book is so general that even someone who has never fished would know more already. Some of the information is inaccurate and/or not up to date. The auther has not been even been fishing for what I think is a long time. He even admits to getting a lot of his info from guides and charters. In fact he talks a lot about all the fish he has cought on the charters and trips he's been on. Anyone can catch fish on a charter. I hope the For Dummies book are not going to all be like this from now on because they are normally very good.
4,"Perfect for beginners, but has info everyone can use","My husband fished a lot as a youth, so when he started teaching our kids to fish, he wasn't a rank beginner. We gotBasic Freshwater Fishingfor our son, and my husband read it, too. Then we came across this book. My husband liked this one much more. He felt that it was a better book for a beginner, but he was also very pleased that he learned a lot from it, himself. He was very impressed with this book."
5,Definitely lives up to its name!,"I originally bought this book for my boyfriend, but I love fishing and know very little about the tricks of catching a fish. I have learned so much about lures and fish and how they think in order to catch fish better. This book is awesome! I totally recommend this book to any ""family fisherman"" if they want to know more."
1,"BAD,NO GOOD,WORST DVD EVER","PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS DVD... ONCE AGAIN [SOMEONE] TRYED TO MAKE A STREET RACING MOVIE AND FAILED.THERE SHOULD BE A WARNING ON MOVIES LIKE THIS,THAT SAY NO REAL STREET RACING!!!!!!!!.IF I WANTED TO SEE A BUCH OF GIRLS MAKING... SUGGESTIONS TO THE CAMERA I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT [ANOTHER MOVIE].IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR STREET RACING VIDEO THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU WANT.MTV'S REAL LIFE I'M A STREET RACER WAS 50 TIMES BETTER THAN THIS..."
1,CRAPPY VIDEO!,This was the crappiest street racing video i have ever seen. Looks like a 10 year old put it together! It was very short and not very many race's in it. I would love to give it back and get my money back!!!! It was very DUMB!!!! Dont waste your money on this video. TRUST ME.
3,What happened?,"For me this was a page turner and I couldn't wait to get to the end. Little did I know that I should not have rushed as the ending was such a disappointment. I hate feeling like I wasted my time when I could have read another book and that's just how I felt. Seems like the last 50 or so pages the writer got tired and was like 'whatever' and threw some mess on the page. After such a disappointing let down, this will be my first and last book from this writer. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
3,A good map and nothing else,"This is an excellant map once you are in london, but you won't find helpful info on restaurants and hotels in this one. I would recommend Frommer's guide to london which has climate for each month and where to go."
4,Chuck Austen does good...,"Some folks won't like this. It's written by Chuck Austen. People hate him with seething, turd-throwing monkey passion.But this trade isn't half-bad. This is a softer take on the big members of the JLA. It deals with their passions and their pain.If every JLA trade was like this, you'd probably want to throw yourself off of a cliff. But -- as a one off kind of thing -- it represents a nice counterbalance to the crazy galactic stories that generally populate the JLA landscape."
3,"Disjointed and Irrelevant, But Not Awful","I remember reading a few of the single issues of this storyline and was not impressed in the least. In fact, I gave up on them. However, after reading the collected edition, I must admit that it was not as terrible as I remembered. Make no mistake, this arc is set amidst the editorial transitions of Infinite Crisis and is also the last of the JLA run initiated by Grant Morrison, so at times World Without a Justice League strikes the reader as disjointed and irrelevant, but, again, it's not awful. I only recommend it if you're compelled to complete the collection.~Scott William Foley, author of Souls Triumphant"
2,15 Pages of a Fight..Waste of Time,"This is the first JLA 'novel' which has disappointed me...It is just one long fight between Green Arrow, Black Canary, Batman and a looney tune villian...No real plot development.I gave it two stars instead of just one because as usual, the art work is fantastic..First time ever I have been bored while reading a JLA story.."
2,Graphic SF Reader,"This traded arc is about the mental and emotional anguish and/or torment that the heroes go through because of what they cannot do, or the mistakes they have made in the past. Basically, here the JLA is functioning as a professional self-help society, so they can talk about their screwups and other problems on the job."
1,Weak!,"After reading (or rather experiencing) classics such as ""Kingdom Come"", comic book fare such as ""Syndicate Rules"" look amaturistic at best. The writing was simply bad. The dialogue was painfully stupid, and the Qward was less than interesting. I could barely make it through the collection. I grew up reading the Barry Allen Flash of the 70s and 80s. It was far better than the crap I read today. The artwork was decent, but somehow it annoyed me as well. All the characters looked so hollow and lifeless. Maybe because you couldn't see the eyes of many of the characters. Don't waste your money on this collection."

3,Kelly Willis displays her Texas-sized talent.,"Kelly Willis is another of the many talented Texas-based country performers that have chosen to remain outside the Nashville mainstream. The genre of ""Bang Bang"" could best be described as Texas county rock with an extra dose of honky tonk. Willis' voice is an original. Passionate and sultry, her voice avoids the prepacked excesses of Shania Twain. While some of the songwriting on ""Bang Bang"" leaves a bit to be desired, Willis' phenomenal talent shines through. Her performances on ""Settle For Love"" and ""Piece of My Heart"" alone make this CD worth the freight."
1,Useless...doesn't even deserve one star.,Simplistic and sparse....not of any use except forthe most simple of problems. Don't waste your money...unfortunately I did. Buy the Cheap & Easy series of books....they're excellent and detailed and informative.
5,"An excellent book--for programmers, managers and testers","This book is fantastic. I'm only a tester to the extent that everyone doing XP is a tester but I found many valuable things in this book. There are excellent chapters about how to estimate and plan releases and iterations, including excellent tips on finding hidden assumptions in your stories. I like the book so much that I just bought a copy for a tester who works for me and told him to go home, read it, and not come back until he has so that we can discuss how to put some of the book's advice into practice. Everyone working on an agile project (not just XP and not just testers) will benefit from this book. It is one of the best-written and most useful in the entire series."
2,"good, but could be better","great for timed voiding. a little time consuming to program, and the battery does not last that long. Huge complaint is that it is not waterproof, just water resistant. I have purchased 4 to date due to water ruining the watch, just from hand washing...(and it is a bathroom reminder, right??)"
1,Too expensive and NOT waterproof,"We bought this for our 4 year old daughter and after the first few months the watch was ruined. Apparently she got it wet when washing her hands and it quit working.She always complained that it was too conspicuous on her little arm, too. She was not crazy about timed voiding in the first place and the aesthetics of the watch was no incentive for her.It was fairly cumbersome to set, as well...not too difficult for me but I'm fairly technical...I can see where it may be an issue for those who may not have patience for such matters.While the vibration does seem to be a stronger/better reminder to use the potty, we will be replacing this watch with a MUCH less expensive, readily available digital watch with simple audible alarms."
1,Nothing but trouble,"We bought this watch for our son and could not get it to work from the get-go. There is a reset button inside, which we reached only after a great deal of work to open the battery compartment, which was stuck tight. I set the alarms, and the watch worked for a day. I reset it again, reset the alarms, and by the end of the day the time was off by hours. A promising idea, but poor quality in this case."
5,Arrived safely,"Awesome watch. Doesn't have one of the features expected but it doesn't affect my opinion.A light would be great.Vibration can be felt well, and not heard."
1,Rate this strip a zero.,"As if there are not enough strips with animals, this one does not deserve the praise it gets. Look in the comics today, aren't most of them about animals? The gas I buy comes from Sinclair and they use a dinosaur for its logo, does that make the gas better? If I purchase food with an animal used for its logo does that make it better? This strip reads ""Not Funny"". Don't purchase it."
4,"""Yet again, I find your desire to eat a monkey disturbing.""","Rob, Bucky, and Satchel continue to entertain readers with their exploits.... well, mostly Bucky's.In Say Cheesy, Bucky really does get a chance to eat a monkey, wrestle a chicken, and duel a ferret. Other animals appearing include a box turtle, a conger eel, a cow, and a great white shark (picture only).And Bucky's thoughts on the meaning of life?""Rather than love,than money,than fame,Give me tuna.""Oh, and don't let Satchel lick the ice cube tray or talk about playing craps."
2,Disappointing,"Even though this book was written in 2000, you'd never know it. It would be a great book for those who do not have Internet Access. This book covers everything from cover letters, resume tips & blunders (how to avoid them) as well as interview prep questions. For those of you who do own or have access to a computer, I recommend passing on this book. With so many job sites out there like Monster and Workopolis, you can find all you need at those sites."
1,Watering Can-o-crap,Buyer beware..... Mind you this is cheap price but since I had to pay for shipping I would think it would have been packaged better. When I got this out of the box I notice that the watering tip was crunched in. When I took a closer look at it the tip broke completely off. I would send it back but I would probably have to pay for shipping again. So I am keeping it. I mean it is still good to water with I guess....it would have probably would have been cheaper to keep the water gallon jug I was using. So now I have a water can with no shower tip....this sucks....at least the tulip decoration is cute....I mostly bought this because it was made in the USA!
3,Okay but not great,I have this watering can. It's best suited to watering outdoor plants because it drips at the end when you're finished watering and because the short spout doesn't enable you to water beyond a single plant if you have them crowded and it's messy indoors.
3,spout problem,We have 3 of these cans. The sprinkler spouts on all of them cracked so they leak or don't stay on. Haven't been able to find replacements
4,It does the job.,"Much more inexpensive than others. It doesn't fly to the moon, ballet dance or solve math problems. But it waters the plants just fine."
5,"lightweight, large capacity, no drip design, excellent value","My old metal can sprung a leak, so I decided to try a plastic replacement. This holds as much water as I can comfortably lift and carry from the kitchen sink, and adds almost no weight of its own. The flow is drip free."
3,Visual Rumi For The Soul,"`Born of Fire' is an obscure, surreal film from '83 starring Peter Firth (Equus). Based on Arabian Mythology, the tale delicately unfolds of a young man who travels to the Middle East in search of the mystical Master Flautist bent on destroying the world through sound.This film is definitely not geared to the general audience. It's extremely slow and the storyline is ill-defined and difficult to follow. However if you give it a chance you'll discover it has a unique, melodic feel all its own that will draw the attentive viewer into it's mystical world and leave its audience a lingering memory of mood and texture if not understanding.My Rating: -3 Stars-."
5,Most Excellent,This is such a blast from the past and made so many people happy. Very quick delivery and item arrive in excellent condition. Definitely would use this seller again in the near future. Thank you
5,"So far, so good! No problems.","This unit has been great so far. Plays DVDs and Audio CDs perfectly, all formats. Will NOT play computer files, that is the only draw back. Remote and menus are well designed."
1,Pretty bad,"Arrived not quite as described. Cheap, pleather, missing the T in passport. Covers the passport fine though. Would not purchase again."
5,Nice,It came on time and looked as nice as it was online.Really nice. Lovely. Very compact and really neat.
3,LOVE RED!,"Love the red color, easy to find in purse while traveling. Leather is soft, and passport fits well in it."
1,Very Unhappy,"I had been planning on purchasing the Kettler Navigator for my son's second birthday when a grandparent surprised us with this Radio Flyer trike. I was happy enough. I know Radio Flyer is a good name & I am very happy with our Radio Flyer wagon. However, this trike DOES NOT live up to it's name. The pushbar mechanism is AWFUL. It doesn't steer AT ALL. It ONLY pushes. So, any time we have to shift or turn in the least bit, it is a big production of unlocking the front wheel or physically lifting the front of the bike. I have tried very hard to like this bike. I love the concept. But, I always end up leaning over the bike & using the handlebars myself to steer it properly. I would be somewhat satisfied if I could just remove the pushbar & my son could use it as a plain trike. BUT, there is no brake!!! If you back pedal it's a free spin. There is no braking action!! NOT ideal for learning to ride a bike. I shouldn't have given it as many chances as I did. I wish I could return it."
3,Don't read reviews on the wrong bike,"We haven't chosen a bike yet, but after reading these reviews we decided to try to try a few out in person. Some of these reviewers are reviewed the fold-to-go trike w/o the parent's bar, which is smaller and much less stable. This one is more stable because the wheels are larger and it seems to have a lower center of gravity than the regular (not XL) fold to go trike w/o the parent's push bar.We probably won't get this one though b/c it doesn't have brakes, a seatbelt, or a parent's bar that steers."
2,Not worth it.,"I did quite a bit of research trying to find a folding trike that was affordable and could easily fit into our hatchback and decided upon this model. Though I was impressed with two features that occur when the parent is pushing the trike, the ""straight steering"" ability and the ability to disengage the pedals so the toddler can rest their feet on the wheels, I found the push bar wobbly and one of the back wheels looked like it was about to fall off. We returned the product and ordered a different trike that cost about twice as much and unfortunately was not folding, nor did it have the two features that I liked the best on this trike."
1,AWFUL!!!!!!,I brought this bike for my daughter for her second birthday she wasn't quit big enough for it but she soon started to ride it. And just now I was taking it outside to let her ride it and it fell apart the bolt that holds the handles on is in 3 pieces. Not the parent handle the one the child holds onto. Awful I still have the receipt and plan on returning it to Toyrus. For a different bike. DOnt buy this BIke Your kid might be on it when it falls apart.
1,What a dissapointment!!!,"I bought this trike for my 2 year old son, my son loves the bike itself but I hate it. The bike seems great but you cant steer the front wheels at all, and is very difficult to keep going straight even with the wheels locked. The bar you use to push is very flimsy so it makes it difficult to steer the whole bike as a whole. Also crossing any high sidewalk or bump is a mission! Im afraid of tilting the bike backwards and placing weight on the handle because it might break off. Thank God I kept the reciept, this bike is going back to TRU right away!!! Dont waste your money!!! Buy something else,I am!!!"
3,Needs a few improvements,"Dislikes:Handle is very wobbly and feels like it's going to break off at any moment.My 21 month old who is tall for her age (36 inches) has trouble getting on and off the bike because seat and handle bars seem to close to the seat compared to other trikes. She has to lift her leg way up to get off and sometimes they get caught on the bars.The annoying clicking sound it makes when your child rests their feet on the pedals while you push them (for those who can't pedal yet). It does not pedal backwards, and will make a clicking sound if your child tries.Likes:It accommodates taller toddlers, with room to grow.It folds up so it can fit better in the back of your car etc. Also makes storing it a bit easier if you are tight on space.Would I buy this one again??? Probably not, it was an impulse buy that I didn't put much research into, if I had to do it again I'd probably go with the trikes that you can steer."
3,"nice, but 2 major flaws","I don't usually have complaint or return products, but I did return this one. It is a really nice, sturdy bike, but it has 2 major flaws. First the back handle is a very flimsy plastic that seems like it would break very easily. I was even scared to use it just running around the living room to try it out. Second, when the front wheel is locked, it is IMPOSSIBLE to turn the bike using the handle. This being said, it would be a great bike for a kid to ride, but not to be pushed."
2,poor design,"Works well enough once your kid can pedal themselves, although both my kids tipped it plenty of times.The steering bar isn't effective. It has too much give prob from the fact it's designed to collapse. Plus it doesn't actually steer the bike (some fancier models have this option).The pin to lock the handle bars doesn't always stick.There are no brakes on this thing. Good for pushing your kid around when they haven't figured out the concept of pedals. Dangerous if your kid is old enough to ride themself and goes careening down a hill because they can't stop and don't want to use the Fred Flinstone braking method.Not worth the money, imo."
1,Handling,"I have a 2 year old daughter and she is just learning how to ride her trike. The reason I bought this trike was so that I would have the option to push her along, however the handle does not turn the wheel to move in the direction you want it to go. Therefore, it is useless when it comes to this option. This trike is only for a child that knows how to pedal a bike, not for the use of a parent to guide him or her. Because of this problem, the second time my daugher used it, I tried to maneuver the trike from going on to the curb, and the handle cracked. It has absolutely no flexibility, making this handle a useless feature."
1,Avoid My Mistake -- Don't Buy This Trike!,"I decided to return this poor quality trike to the store after trying to push my 2 year old son around the block. The handle is flimsy and will break if you try to steer from behind. The trike may fold up and be easy to store, but it is also very heavy making it more difficult for a toddler to handle. The kicker is that the coaster wheel does nothing but coast--no matter how hard you pedal the wheel will not spin."
2,Bad Handle,"My 2 1/2 yr old daughter loves to ride this trike, but I think the handle is poorly constucted. It's not durable at all, easily shifts from one setting to another-which is NOT good. When the handle is in the longest position (so the parent can hold onto the trike), it is very wobbly and feels as if it's going to break. I am taking this back to Toys R US tomorrow to get a full refund."
3,"OK, but not very durable","So we got this trike for my daughter...to be a gift for her 2nd birthday. Now that she's 2.5 years old, it's something she can use a little on our hardwood floor.Outside of that, YOU probably want to know ""how is it?"" Well, it's OK. There is a lock to keep the steering wheel straight, but it seems very breakable. (When in the locked position, the wheel still moves, and the lock...bends, for lack of a better description.) The handle seems like a good idea, but it's too short, and fragile. You can hear the handle creak when you push on it, if someone's on the seat. (Isn't that why you HAVE the handle: so you can control the trike while your child is on it?) Also, our first one arrived with plastic cracked.We'll see if I want to update this next summer...but I think I'll say this is just an OK trike."
2,It's a bike I guess,This bike is pretty lame. It would be worth the money to buy one that you can steer when you have control of the handle. It was cheap so that was it's best selling point.
1,Why waste time and money on books like these?,"Before you are going to spend any money to buy this book, think about this:""If he is so successful in trading futures, and became a master and making tonnes of money, why does he bother to write a book to teach other people his successful methods?""Is Warren Buffet (the second richest man in the world) writing a book to teach people how to invest in stocks and become as rich as he is?If you find out a way to make money in trading futures, would you have any spare time besides growing your portfolio to millions? Why would you even want to teach others to compete against you?"
5,Finally see the value in RFID,Excellent book. Clearly written. Explains the actual value of RFID and gives numerous real word examples from really companies. Cuts through the fantasy of what RFID can do and actually shows how a company can really use RFID to further their business goals.
2,Too advanced for me!,I had just got done reviewing all my basic chords on a Fender accoustic instructional DVD. But when I put this in my player it was just too hard!! I oculd play songs like Hideaway and Sunflower Slow Drag in high school in 1976 but this is 2008. And I do not have that advanced levelof proficciency!! I can pluck out tunes from instruction on another DVD course and three basic fingerstyle patterns like T-1-2-3 or T-321 but this was over my head. I'll just strum and sing SILENT NIGHT for my mom. That's all we did in 1976 in the church folk guitar group.
3,SHELCORE SHAKE N BOBBLES CEMENT MIXER,"THIS IS A CUTE LITTLE TOY FOR THE PRICE. WHEN YOU PUSH THE LITTLE BOBBLES HEAD THE MIXER TURNS AND LIGHTS UP. MY GRANDSON FINDS IT VERY FASCINATING. HOWEVER, IT IS VERY HARD PLASTIC. PROBABLY WON'T LAST LONG IF IT GETS TOSSED AROUND."
2,Waste of Money,"This is the second Shelcore toy we own. We also own the Shelcore Pirate Ship. Both toys never worked! We put in brand new batteries and still nothing. I've been lucky that my son is 2 and he was just happy to play with it without the extras, however I would have liked to know that I payed full price for an item that worked."
4,dinner bell??,"Subdued dinging of bell was reassuring to let us know where the rest of hiking party was....Since we didn't get eaten by a bear, it must have worked? We also had whistles and bear mace. Fortunately, the bell is all that was used."
3,Adequate.,"This seems reasonably well put together, and it's inexpensive, but the magnet only silences the bell when placed at the bottom of the bell, so that the ball bearing in the bell is held against all four tines of the bell at once, and the magnet isn't strong enough to prevent the ball from being shaken out of that position. A stronger magnet might be able to hold the ball bearing firmly enough to withstand more vigorous shaking, and might even be able to silence the bell with the magnet stuck anywhere on it, not just at the bottom. I may attempt to modify mine.So my guess is that this product will get the job done if a bear bell is right for the territory, but the design could be improved.This blue bear bell is also a darker, less saturated blue than it appears in the picture, not that that really matters."
2,question about mahanta,"I have a question about the term Mahanta, and have heard thatthis author had not attained to this position and was in fact removed in 1984 by the teaching masters of Eck order, so wonderabout the validity of this material."
4,Pretty good -- especially the music,"While the lyrics and the singing are best ignored, the music on this album is really quite good -- refresingly original, in fact -- reminiscent of the finest alternative prog-rock of the past few years, with none of the stupid portenteousness. I definitely recommend this one, though I would suggest that everyone ask them to get a new lyricist."
4,"Great, Different Sound","I just discovered this via Pandora a week ago, although it was released in late 2007. I heard this band described as Radiohead without words, and Miles Davis with guitars, and I'd say that's right on the money. My review title says it all!"
5,What's the big deal?,"Who cares if the liner notes are wrong. Does it really matter?What's important is that all the songs on both of Keith's albums are on this CD,including ""I'm Easy"", and that the recordings are very clean. FYI, my liner notes just happened to be correct. Even if it wasn't, big deal!"
4,The track list is wrong,"Tracks 1 to 9 are wrong ! I bought the CD and confirm that ""I'm easy"" is the 4th. one."
2,You get what you pay for...,"this is definitely a cheap watchband. I can hardly believe it is leather. It works, keeps my weekend watch on my wrist, but is so stiff it can't conform to my wrist and instead is trying to make my wrist conform to it."
4,"Not quite what I expected, but still nice...","This comb is really beautiful, and does do a great job of holding my hair (quite a feat considering it's hip length and naturally curly), but, even though the decoration on it is very beautifully made, I was a little surprised at the comb itself. The prongs on it are not round and stiff like most french combs, instead they are flat and almost a little flimsy, and on occasion, have pulled my hair a little. I would have thought for the price the comb would have been smoother and stronger. I don't think it's going to break /too/ easily.... but it would be more comfortable to wear without the rough edges on the tips."
5,Embracing Bill,"I never liked Shakespeare. I never understood Shakespeare. Then along came No Fear Shakespeare and now I not only get it, but am eager to read more of the bard. King Lear has it all - arrogance, greed, love, hate, redemption - what a great story! I heartily recommend."
2,Not what I expected....,"My daughter does not like these bars, and I don't blame her. They are basically a granola bar, with a few dried blueberries mixed in. I don't think they taste like much of anything, and they are somewhat sticky and dry."
5,great to throw in the bag and take along,My kids are allergic to peanuts and these bars don't contain nuts. Most bars without nuts crumble and I can't take them with me but these were great and my 3 boys LOVE them.
1,Expires in 2 months.,I received 12 boxes that expires in 2 months. The rating is based on the expiration date. The product itself is pretty decent. My 2 year old likes it.
3,Earth's Best Kidz Whole Grain Bars,My boys were not crazy about these whole grain bars. My four year old will not eat them and my two year old will eat about half of it and throw it away.
2,Why ?,"This DVD has only FOUR songs. The songs are either in black and white (they are from the 60's) or so heavily solarized and chroma-keyed that you cannot make out any distinct features. These songs have been played on such channels as VH-1 Classics but unfortunately appear here in a somewhat more edited version. The songs do not play continuosly leaving you to choose them only from the menu. There is a ""pop-up"" choice (where you play these same videos with VH-1 style pop-ups). The total playing time of these four songs is less than twelve minutes !!"
2,Who? What is this?,"Disappointed with this product? Yes. Three out of four videos are from the ""Tommy"" album. The manufacturer, Classic Pictures, could have put ""Pictures of Lily,"" ""Magic Bus,"" ""So Sad About Us,"" or even ""Happy Jack"" on the EP instead of songs from ""Tommy."" The only song not from ""Tommy"" is ""I'm A Boy."" The manufacturer could have even put ""My Generation"" on it. Thumbs down to this product!"
5,"Wonderful taste, quick easy meal!","My husband's family is from Selesia. This mixed is very close to the real thing! Cook some boiled potatoes, and poor soup over the potatoes for an authentic Selesian meal!! We had been getting the soup mix from relatives in Germany, but glad we can order online now."
2,Packing Tape Fix...,"I've had this pouch for a little over three weeks. Today, while pulling out the binder from my briefcase, I noticed the pouch's bottom seam has ripped open (meaning the pens/pencils will fall out). Fairly disappointed with this - I wasn't planning on having to ghetto-rig it with packing tape (yet).The photograph shown with the product description is holding much more than my actual pouch is holding - so needless to say, I'm disappointed."
1,not pleased,The end edge tore out in first week without a reason. There was no undue strain because of overfilling or uneven pressure.
2,Much too general,"Might be somewhat useful for a used boat buyer. If your looking for information on what to look for in a new boat save your money. There is little or no information on what makes one boat better made than another. What information there is, is of the most basic kind (""drip pans under the engine should have no oil in them""..duh). Some of the information is outdated also. I finished the book in about 20min and will donate it to the library."
5,Great!,This book is so colorful and appealing to the eye. There are fun pictures and lots of gret information about Lindsay. I definitely recommend this book.
5,Best book on Lindsay I've Found,What's so cool about this book is that the pictures rock AND that I finally have book that tells me real stuff I want to know about Lindsay!!! There's lots of stuff in here that is so new to me--I keep reading it over and over again!
3,lohan review 3,I bought this book for a friend at work whose daughter love lohan and she read it within a day.
5,Excellent Product,"Everything about this product is good from the dripless pour spout to the corkscrew, vacuum and stoppers. The vacuum stoppers work much better than the last ones I had, and this has to be one of the best corkscrews that I ever used. I bought this for a gift and ended up keeping it for myself :)"
5,Great wine saver,This product is great. I got it as a gift for my in-laws and they love it. Perfect for people who drink only drink a glass or two of wine a night.
1,Terrible Tapping Sounds,"I could NOT get past the constant tapping I was hearing in these recordings,it was terrible!! To top that off his tone was thin and too high in pitch for me! Stick with the Rostropovich recordings. If you don't believe my claims, then just compare these one after another."
3,Yes but . . .,"Yes, the playing is beautiful. Yes, the dances have a rhythmic spring. Yes, Isserlis understands the arc of the melody. But I am reminded of how a non-English conductor instructed an English orchestra on rehearsing a Mahler symphony: ""Forget that you are gentlemen."" Well, Isserlis does not forget that he is a gentleman. Granted Bach isn't Mahler, but there is room for a lot more gutsiness and passion than we get here. Emotionally these performances are on the cool and tepid side. Everything is very genteel, very proper. I want this music to grab me by the lapels, and these performances don't do that. Without being self-indulgent, many others do: Casals, Mork, Wispelwey I, Haimowitz, Ma I, Kirschbaum and Starker to name a few. If you want more committed performances with the same beauty and elegance as these, Fournier is your man."
3,Ellen faces hard times,The Unicorn Club's biggest airhead-Ellen's-mum and dad are divorcing and Ellen wants desperately to keep it a secret from her friends or she will be kicked out of the snobby club...so she thinks.
5,Great book,This book exposes the inaccuracies of Mr. Limbaugh very well. It is a must for anyone critical of Rush or anyone who wants to de-program a ditto head
1,"Typical attack on Rush, using facts to obscure the obvious.","Better read the first half of ""Rush Limbaugh is a Big FatIdiot"" if you want to be entertained. This reads more like thesecond whiny half of same."
1,Another case of Rush Limbaugh envy...,This is just another case of Limbaugh envy. After reading this book it is obvious that the author has never listened to Mr. Limbaugh. There are many inaccurate statements in this book. It would be refreshing to have someone that has actually listened to Mr. Limbaugh and then try to point out any inaccurate statements. It is a cheap shot to have to put Mr. Limbaugh's picture on the cover just to sell his book
1,Rip off artist,"A poorly written, alarmist book, that had to use Rush Limbaughs name to sell copies. I wouldn't waste by time"
4,No way to convince the mind-numbed robots of anything,"Limbaugh has tried to minimize the impact of this book by saying that of more than 4,000 hours (or whatever it is) of broadcasting in his entire career, all they could come up with were a few dozen mistakes...comlpetely ignoring the fact that the authors very clearly say they only listened for a couple of weeks to amass this string of whoppers. And the lies, distortions and half-truths continue to this day. Has this guy actually gained a new listener in the last five years? Rumor is even Limbaugh doesn't actually believe everything he says on the air....it's frightening that his listeners lap it all up like gospel..."
5,Pinko Conservatives go home,"Great book. This book exposes Rush Limbaugh as the Republican Automoton that he is (that's a robot for all you conservatives).Only a fool would disregard such an expose as false, when all statements are backed up with credible sources.Bye-Bye Rush. And good riddance."
1,This book stinks!,Steve Rendall has no grasp of the truth whatsoever.I wouldn't recommend this book to ANYONE!
1,Good Airplane Fodder,"I read this book on a plane last week, it's a short and easy read (128 pages). It is entertaining if you aren't a serious policital follower and like sound bites.I enjoy these type of books to kill time on a plane. The genre that takes a transcript of a public figure, makes the statement an absolute and always out of context, and then refutes it with pseudo-statistics.I've never listened to Rush Limbaugh or heard of the author, but if I spoke impromptu on the radio X number of hours a week, I am sure that someone could take prove some of my statements wrong.I recommend it for the fun reading, you will get snickers out of Limbaughs outrageous statements and the authors handwringing responses.5 Stars for entertainment, 1 star as a piece of literature."
1,Randall has distorted more in this Book than Rush,"Rendall attacks Rush as a distorter of fact, and most of his arguments and examples are provably false and willful distortions themselves. The sad this that the editors themselves did no fact checking on what this author said.I am all for meaningful dialog about the issues, but this book is nothing but false ad hominen. It would have been more interesting to take Rush on for what he believes and debate those believes with truth and facts, which is what I had hoped this book would offer. It does not.This book has already been proven to be almost 100% distortion. This author takes a statement of opinion that can be the subject of debate, declares the statement to be inaccurate and therefore a lie. The other devise used is the favorite of all debaters when they have nothing else, the Ad Hominen. Anyone who has even listened to rush will know that he is always courteous to callers even against raised voices and lies."
1,Lacking any research - an incompetent political attack,"This author should be in truth prison. A transparent attempt to create an ""expose"" out of thin air and falsehoods. A simple check of the facts leaves you wondering how anyone could waste their time with such claptrap. It's really a free country when this stuff is allowed in print."
1,"Sadly, a waste of time and money","A simple Internet Search of the sources of this book will show it is bereft of any truth. I cannot believe a publisher allowed this unrepentent drivel into print. Limbaugh should sue for slander.And since the libs reading this review will slam me, not what I say, keep me anonymous. Those libs are nuts!If you doubt me, read the reviews slamming me!"
1,You write a book and lie about someone telling the truth?,This book is not about the truth. It is defending liberalism at its best. Don't spend your hard earned money on it.
1,Flock of their own,"What is most amusing about this book is that the authors have found a venue to cash in on the success of another, and a way to amass a flock of their own to lead around. Guess that makes it worth all the trees that got cut down to print it.Otherwise, yawn..."
1,Liberals can't handle the truth and this book proves it.,"Jack Nicholson was right. If you're a left-wing, lie-mongering, hate-speaking, fact ignoring, liberal obviously a guy who speaks forthrightly and truthfully and doesn't spout erroneous pap like liberal media figures and politicians love to do is going to frustrate you, burst your falsely-idealist little liberal bubble and rain on your archaic and faltering parade. Face it liberals YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH! and this book proves it."
1,Author of this book is in total denial of reality!,The author of this ... is like most liberals when it comes to a total lack of understanding of reality. History and facts have to be completely ignored to come to the authors conclussions. I recommend not buying this book...
1,FAIR isn't -- and they cannot keep their facts straight.,"The distortions, misquotations, and out of context examples are easily verifiable as false. This is an attempt to distort the discussion by a partisan group, nothing more. It is sad to see 'progressives' need to lie even to themselves when confronted by easily verifiable facts."
1,"Arrogant, idiotic, just plain stupid","Wow, some stupid, arrogant, one sided, biased twit wants to discredit a republican truth finder by publishing a book of 100 comments?? 100? HA! Truly idiotic. I guess the authors can't accept truth for truth. Liberal buttheads. More than 94 of those things can be disproven, usually because they twisted his words around. The rest were simple mistakes, ones that every radio talk show host makes, on the part of Rush."
5,A favorite among Christmas albums,"Beautiful, quiet, low key piano arrangements, mostly familiar carols. Having bought and enjoyed it for many years, recent purchase was for a gift."
3,Interesting Way to Present the Topic,"Not rocket science, but a pretty simple way to look at professional presence in terms of personal, team, and organizational competencies. The Life GPS was a useful tool."
1,Reaching the Next Level,"Scott Eblin takes the reader on a wonderful ride of executive leadership and management by drawing on his years of experience in human resources and human resource management. For Eblin the essence of getting from point A to point B is more than a linear approach of plotting a course, but a dynamic process of self-discovery and self differentiating behavior. Additionally, in moving to the Next Level, Eblin coaches the reader into an understanding of the component parts that make that moving process work. It's not for the timid or meek. Dr. Jay"
1,just raw,"wasn't the versions I expected. I had the vinyl remix and it was called the same, but I didn't hear what I had before."
2,One Song does NOT an album make!,"Yeah, this was purchased only on the strength of ""She Drives Me Crazy!""I musta been crazy!I'll be kind and give it ""2 stars"" for that song alone!"
2,Not for the layperson,"I waited for this book to come in the mail with great expectations. But I was really disappointed. The author writes in other languages a great deal; more than I think he should, it's very distracting when you can't read it. The book is boring, and pretentious, and not very straightforward; a hodgepodge of information is so highbrow that those who would most benefit from it will not be able to complete it."
4,Not Bright but fun,"These light covers tend to be to dark but they are fun. the only negative is that some of the holes are so big that you lose the flip flop if they are mounted ina windy area, so I had to use a glu gun to seal the hole to keep them on the light bulb."
4,Have a party!,"Great, fun, party lights for atmosphere. They are colorful and give off sufficient light. Also make a great gift for someone else's party."
4,More dinosaurs please,"I liked this book. It was well written and an enjoyable read. I think I expected to read about a few more dinosaurs than just a monoclonius and a lizard man. Compared to Thomas Hopp's new Dinosaur Wars, this one comes off as a little lacking in the thing I read dino-fiction for: Dinosaurs! Still, it is long on charm, with space ships and wild indians. It might be a little dated by its view of dinosaurs as cold-blooded lizards, because scientists have recently learned that the beasts were warm blooded and covered with feathers, as in Hopp's two new dino-novels. Well, I suppose even dinosaur fiction is evolving."
3,If you dig alternate history and dinosaurs,"This is a light and entertaining novel set in the Wild West in the post-Custer's last stand period, when Men were Men and so were paleantologists. The competitive parring of the foremost experts in the field, O. C. Marsh of Yale and Edward Cope of Philadelphia, is the milieu further complicated by the presence of a young woman masquerading as a man, Sitting Bull and nearly the entire Sioux nation, and two extraterrestrial bone-hunters with advanced technology and and secret agendas of their own. I enjoyed it -- I have been fascinated by the great ""Bone Wars"" (see the Kathryn Lasky novel of the same title for an entertaining take) for a long time (not geological time, but nevertheless...) so I was a sucker for this novel."
3,Not Quite What I wanted,"This book, while deviating from most of the traditional vows, still did not have what I was looking for. I am a single mom who is going to marry a man who has never been married. There are so many different situations, that one small book could never really do justice to all the possibilities. For people who want a still fairly traditional ceremony, this book would be fine. Keep looking if you want something totally unique"
5,very very helpful,"I am a newly ordained minister. With this book I was able to help the couple that i wedded, by putting together vows, and a perfect ceremony. It was easy to read. It had all kinds of helpful advice and it helped me build beautiful vows for this couple. This book will be my refrence to putting together other weddings. It is a great book for a person who is only going to use it once or many times."
2,Nothing here you can't get for free,I didn't find this book to be anything special. There wasn't anything in the book that I couldn't find for free over the net. We found that the person who marries you will already have a wide selection of things to choose from.
2,Great book for quotes,"Title is deceptive, be warned. The book's beginnings might be helpful to some, to write their own ceremony, then vastly full of quotes that your officiant may use, but probably not to say in a vow."
3,The Everything Wedding Vows Book,Not a bad book. Coming from another country other than America - this one wasn't so American which was a bonus. Some helpful suggestions.
1,really? someone's making money from this?,google people. 3/4 of the book is merely quotes. quotes you can find online FOR FREE. If you really want to look at this book go to the library and glance through it. I promise you won't even bother checking it out. If you do chances are you're going to forget about it behind the chouch and then you'll have to pay late fees for a book that did NOTHING to help you plan your wedding.save your money for your wedding.
4,"It is just what it says ""Vows""","I did like this book. It gives step by step how the wedding ceremony is planned out. Greeting, Declaration of Consent,Charge to the convocation, Address, Readings, Vows, Ring Exchange, Pronouncement. However just as the title says it only gives vows. If you are looking for a book that offers more about each part of the wedding this is not for you. If you are looking just for the ""Vow Portion"" of the ceremony you won't be dissapointed."
3,Okay book but not super helpful,This book was not as helpful as I thought it would be. I was looking for nice quotes about love that I could use on my wedding day. This book has a large section of quotes but none of them were all that great. The book gives advice on how to write your own vows but not enough examples. Not a terrible book but not as helpful as it could be.
4,Cute and fun,"We had a subscription to the monthly packet from Brighter Vision when my son was 18 months to about 3 years old (which was 5 years ago). From what I remember, the spiral books included things like games, songs and finger plays, short stories, worksheets with stickers, and other activities to cut and paste (booklets, mobiles, etc.), all based around a monthly theme. My son really enjoyed spending time with me doing these and learned quite a bit from them. I wish they still offered a monthly subscription as I yet again have a toddler at home. It was a fantastic deal: the spiral activity book, a nice hard cover book, dvd of songs, craft project, stickers and a parent newsletter for @$18/month. Definitely recommend."
5,Go dodgers!,"Love this hat. This size is a tad to big but oh well, I couldnt ever find this black on black hat in a smaller size. Great quality hat. If I lost this hat or something happened to it Id definitely buy it again."
5,a great traditional singer,"Wushinfir Aregaw has a wonderful voice, flexible and soulful. I enjoy listening to this CD - especially to songs 2,4,7. To my ears Wushinfir is one of the best singers in contemporary Ethiopian music. His voice instantly reminded me of the great Muluken Melesse, but is more traditional.I recommend this CD to anyone who wants to hear a great vocalist singing his country's traditional songs."
1,Zero Stars,"DON'T BUY IT!This junk is hazardous to your iPod! It fried my iPod 2G Shuffle because it has the wrong pinout on the plug. It puts the common on one data pin and +5V on what should be the common.Both the 110 and the 12V unit are wired the same, either will kill your iPod!The manufacturer has not responded to my complaint."
2,European shoes aren't for the Americas,"I don't know what is up with these pointy clown looking shoes but that style is terrible....the shoes looks great in the pics until u get them in the box and realize that they look like boats. What is up with the extra 2"" space between your toes and the tip of the shoe....that's a great style? I'd love to see the board that looked at these types of shoes and said great gosh golly...I love it man! Whatever happened to normal square or round fronts? Those aren't in style anymore? Please make me a shoe Kenneth Cole that fits my feet(Remember some people feets are wide especially in the americas considering the amounts of foods we eat) with space for the toes to breathe like the T-flex or the business artierl (don't remember the spelling) shoes. Those were great.....Sorry but these are a joke unless u want people to think ""My, U have big feet (wink, wink)"". As for me I am secure in my manhood....don't need big shoes for confirmation."
4,Instant restaurant miso,"This stuff is perfect for a camping trip or when you're too lazy to cut your own tofu and green onion to mix with proper miso paste. My 6 YO son loves it because it's nice and salty. And how many of us are willing to open a tub of tofu to cut half an ounce of the stuff, anyway? It's not perfect but it makes up for that in convenience."
2,Not what I expected...,"I was very disappointed in this book. It gives a brief summary of the workings of Access, which I already knew. However, it is very skimpy on the technical details involved in publishing a database to the web. There has to be better books out there, somewhere."
1,"Mostly basic Access; poor English, badly edited","I agree with EVB on both content and quality. Most of the book covers basic Access info and is so badly written as to be nearly unreadable. Apparently, the publishers were so greedy to get yet one more Internet book for market that they forgot to assign an editor."
1,Sad! Sad! Sad!,"One day my grandchildren will happily speak of this CD in the same sentence as other classics like Don Johnson's ""Heartbeat"".... or William Shatner's ""Transformed Man"". Is Regis really only 73, because he has the voice of modern day siren...."
1,Don't quit your day job,"Regis is a cool Cat,but as a Vocalist I ain't seeing alot there.the arrangements are decent but nothing really stands out.Being a Crooner is a Special gift but nowadays so many Hit&Miss Acts think they can pull it off.this is a tough style of Performing to do because you have to understand balance,feeling&more importantly leaving a Signature to this Particular Styling. this Disc ain't it."
1,Another vanity effort by a non-singing star,"Regis Philbin cannot sing...let us not mince words here..This album appears because Philbin is a big teevee star,and not because he can sing his way out of a paper bag(indeed,one listento his breathless vocals..and I, DO mean""breathless,as if he is on the verge of a heart-attack, should be convincing enough)..indeed,singing his way out of a paper bag would probably be more entertaining than listening to the way he butchers some great tunes...His old side-kick,Cathy Lee Gifford,can sing,but her rather chilly personna tends to preclude any real mega-success as a singer,especially as her career since leaving Philbin and daytime teevee has been minimal..Philbin is charming,has had success both on daytime teevee and with ""Who wants to be a millionaire"",and thinks that these attributes earn him the right to inflict yet another ""celebrity-who-cannot-sing""album onto the listening public...This is an album for diehard Philbinites only.."
5,REGIS SHINES,"WOW...WOW... My Mother asked me what I wanted for Christmas(I am 46 yrs. old) and I said Regis Philbin's ""new CD"" she wasnot so shocked because as I have always told her THIS IS REALMUSIC. I could not wait so I bought it the day ""it dropped"".Regis you fill my heart with joy and memories of danicing withmy Dad (70 yrs. old) on top of his feet to great leagend's ofour time....and you Mr. Philbin are one of those. Thank you forbring this CD to all that love and respect you.P.S. My money's on you and YOU WILL make to #1 on the charts!!Debbie from Rocklin, California USA"
4,Philbin the crooner,"Yes, we are entertained by Regis every morning. I don't normally review novelty recordings such as this, But I'm doing this a favor for my wife Diane, a huge fan. Only a fraction of his adoring public knows of his vocal skill as a singer.Granted, he is no Bennett or Vic Dimone. But Regis is a more-tha-competent vocalist. This is his ""follow-up"" to his 1968 album Time For Regis, which at that time was standard fair for the pop music world.Regis competently sways and phrases through the standards, almost effortlessly-he does not desire anything more nor compromises for anything less. Good entertainment, if little depth; but why does it have to be? This is music from when he was young man and he wants to make it his own. Since todays rage is revisiting the standards (look at Rod Stewart's success and the like) Regis comes off here as a natural. No sweat.Entertainment for the uncomplicated soul."
5,Beautiful song,"Brings memory, never get tired of listening this cd. I want to place an order another one for a gift."
2,Cute but undependable,"Had the drive for eight months and it suddenly died. It died not through misuse. It suddenly got hot and ceased to be recognized. This experience alone means nothing, but others have had it. What good is a memory devise if it loses its memory?"
2,Works great but dies soon,I bought the 5GB version. It died w/in 1 month - Seagate replaced it. It's been 1 yr/2 mo and it has died again. The warranty period is 1 yr. I loved the drive and used it every day but am looking for a different brand with a longer warranty period.
5,Super Drive,"I've had this model drive for over 2 years and I have never had a single problem with it. I take it everywhere with me and I'm not always gentle, but this drive has outdone every expectation I had of it. I know it may not be as fast as over drives, but at the time it was the biggest drive I could get for school and as I said it has taken a beating and still performed flawlessly for me. It's good points outweigh the slow speed."
4,Excellent Price ($50) And easy to use,"I loved the price on this one. Also, having the USB Cord come out of it helps this drive to fit in any USB slot, no matter what is plugged in around it.It felt a little slow transferring data, but I'm pretty impatient. It's also a bit on the big side. I have already recommended this drive to several people."
1,Doesn't Last Long!!!,"This drive is not reliable. Read the other reviews here. Mine died exactly 7 months after I bought it. No chance to recover the data on it either. In addition, the drive speed when it was working is slooooow. You would be much better off with a flash drive."
1,Not dependable,"Great drive UNTIL it died. I used it for work purposes, transporting files, etc. Then, after about 6 months of use, it died. Basically, my computer didn't recognize it when I would plug it in to a USB port."
1,Loved It Until It Died!,"After two months of use, one day the computer stopped recognizing the drive. I called Seagate, spent an hour on the phone troubleshooting with them only to learn that the drive is basically dead. My company's IT dept. confirmed this.When I called warranty service, Seagate said the warranty had expired. I told them the drive was only a few months and there is a one-year warranty so how could the warranty have expired? Very frustrating so now I have to send all kinds of proof for a product that was a gift, pretty challenging. Also their service center is in India so you get occassional bad phone connections and some difficulty communicating.More than anything, the massive loss of data is really, really bad. I got a quote from them to recover the data: $1,400. I don't have that kind of money to get my data back.Buyer Beware."
4,Solving contradictions,"Emil Bock describes the events occurred in the life of the young Jesus, solving the inextricable problems and contradictions found by the theologians. One of these contradictions refers to the two different genealogies of Jesus. Those ones who know the level and the impact that this subject has, know what I mean. But this is not only subject approached by Emil Bock. It worths read it!"

But these is not only subject approached by Emil Bock. It worths read it!"
5,"PART OF YOUR HISTORY, The Songs of John Hartford","PART OF YOUR HISTORY, The Songs of John Hartford is a thoughtful cross-section of the John Hartford catalog. It features classic as well as underground favorites, more in tribute to his songwriting than to his instrumental influence. The covers are punctuated by the title cut, from Jamie's own pen, and tied together with his deft guitar playing and subtle vocal interpretations.The project offered Jamie the chance to bring together artists such as Nanci Griffith, Vassar Clements, Sam Bush, Kathy Mattea, Pat McLaughlin, David Grisman, Bela Fleck, Tim O'Brien, Ronnie McCoury, Kim Richey, Norman Blake, and Emmylou Harris. Their deeply personal contributions underscore not only the breadth and vitality of the John Hartford legacy, but also the transcendent musical connection of father, family, and flock.Highly recommended."
2,Brighter than God,"I originally bought because I liked the fact that it was simple and had large numbers. The interface is easy to understand and its simple to set up both alarms if you need two in the morning or whatever. However, the display is brighter than god. Yes, it dims automatically when the lights go off, but it's not that dim - expect to see everything in your room suffused in a bright eerie blue glow. I have to set books in front of it just to get to sleep.My advice is to pass on this one."
3,...better Shamanic books.,"This book really doesn't provide enough information to practise Shamanism.I would recommend""Rainbow medicine: A visionary guide to Native American Shamanism"" Wolf Moondance""Secrets of Shamanism: Tapping the spirit power within you"" Jose and Lena Stevens""Shamanic Experience"" Keneth Meadows""Shamanism as a spiritual practise for daily life"" Tom Cowan""The Way of the Shaman"" Michael Harner ....Wah Doh Ogedoda"
2,Vague pop psychology,"'Shamanism and Personal Mastery' promises great changes, but then leaves all the work to you. The description of shamanic tools, such as conscious projection, power words, and power objects, is too superficial to be practically useful. The author spends far more time suggesting how your mental and emotional attitudes will affect your results. The suggestion is that changing your thinking is the key to personal mastery, and shamanic tools are simply methods which help you focus. However, the suggestions for positive and purposeful thinking are just as vaugue as the descritptions of shamanic tools. You'd be better off getting books that are pure psychology, or pure shamanism. This book attempts to be both, and succeeds at neither."
1,As bad as The Rugrats,If you have seen my other reviews on Pet Alein DVDs then I am being honest to you Pet Alein is a lame lame show. I don't thinck your kids that are over 6 years old will like it very much.This show is more for kids 6 and under.
1,Did you say better then Spongebob!?,Who in the hell said this was better then Spongebob it's not!Whoever said that go to school!Why don't you get a sence of humor.
2,Even worse than Atomic Betty--- Atomic TOMMY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a lame-lame show that shouldn't have been released into DvD! It's nothing but fart humor and burping humor. Hm, Do you want your kids to copy this show and force a fart/burp and expect this to be polite???!!! If you parents say ""yes,"" then I suggest you should go out more. If you want your kids to watch a funny and clean show try watching salute your shorts!"
4,EXCELLENT,"For movies on a low priced disc this cannot be beaten. The set I have comes from 'Platinum"" and contains the following 4 movies:Public Cowboy No. 1Ride Ranger RideRim of the CanyonYodelin' Kid From Pine RidgeThese four movies are in a boxed set containing another Platinum disc which has the following movies:The Man From Music MountainOh, SusannaThe Old Barn DanceThe Old CorralIf you enjoy seeing Gene Autry ride the range again, then all these movies will certainly please. Digitally enchanced & Digitally mastered. Almost as good as new.Ride, cowboy, ride.As with all inexpensive sets there may some minor viewing problems."
4,NON-DAIRY CREAMER,"Rosebud. I first learned of their existence on Warner Brothers 1971 lp sampler Non-Dairy Creamer. Years later, I traced the song Raider from Plainsong to Farewell Aldebaran. Judy Henske and Jerry Yester to Rosebud. Panama was on the sampler. Opens the Rosebud show. Which because of changing affections closed the Rosebud show. During the program, however, the songs were the thing. Collector's Choice Music to the rescue. Panama, Le Soleil, Reno, Western Wisconsin, Loreli--all fabulous. Anybody looking for pristine harmony vocals will love these songs. Lullaby also impeccable. Arrangement Yester. Jerry Yester also produced. Roll Home Cheyenne is a definite piece of Americana. Flying to Morning the end of the record. Nice arrangement, great Judy vocal. Violins, piano--a little pounding and swing. Out."
3,"It isn't THAT Rosebud, people...","I don't know what album the rest of these guys are reviewing, but it isn't this one. This ""Rosebud"" is headed by ""Jump, Little Children"" lead Jay Clifford. I don't have all the details, but ""Rosebud"" was a light jazz side project. I'm not sure if any others from ""Jump, Little Children"" were directly involved, but the influence is definitely apparent. They also released a 2nd album titled ""Vespers.""This album's songs are fairly slow and a bit repetitive. I'd only recommend it for diehard Jay Clifford fans. The music got markedly better in the 2nd album and in Jay Clifford's solo release ""Driving Blind"" which is in the middle ground between ""Jump, Little Children""s pop-rock and ""Rosebud""s quiet jazz.I know this is lousy review. Mostly I just wanted to point out this is NOT the same album everyone seems to assume it is."
2,Could Be Better,"It is an okay movie. It pales in comparison to The Song Of Bernadette, which won four (4) Academy Awards (1943). The script in this movie needs to be revisited and the director more sensitive to the subject matter. Plenty of parts left out and the movie suffers from it. You need to see The Song Of Bernadette to understand the difference. You will probably buy the version as I did. It is remarkable and a classic."
1,The Worst,"This dribble does not deserve the name of the admas band. It is boring and dull, not the usual Alemayehu I'm used to."
3,Misrepresentation from reviews,This battery was to replace one for my Palm Zire 72. It didn't come with any instructions or tools to remove the old battery even though one of the reviews for this battery said that it did. So far the battery is working but seems to go down pretty quickly.
3,Needs more...,"When I ordered this DVD I expected more behind the scenes on recording of their albums and more live concert footage but I was very much disappointed. Granted there are a number of music videos but I was hoping for more. There is a few behind the scene footage and some (very little) live footage but it just leaves wanting more. Maybe, hopefully they will have another DVD out soon with more I and more than likely other fans expect to see."
3,dare I say .....disconnected,"Ever since their Disconnected CD this band has been uh well, for lack of better words- disconnected- their path is not clear -some good material some poor unfoccussed material. This DVD follows this pattern- there are some good moments but it's one of those DVDS you just don't want to watch too much- lacks information, footage, history, explanations....it's kind of disconnected. I think they need some new blood in the band or I would like to see Artesti come back to inject some life in this band. I am not sorry I purchased this because I really like and respect this band but something is missing."
2,Too expensive - little information,All of the information in this book is available through the US customs website. Don't waste your money.The bonus chapter is a shameless plug for you to use the services of a couple Hong Kong firm's who the author apparently is associated with. Skip this book.
2,Mediocre at best,"I bought this product for a young relative of mine. I did not even bother send it to her and actually returned it after a couple of days of trying it out. The product itself is very flimsy and not intuitive to use, but what really made me return it is the ""speaking"" part. If you are lucky to find a work that the machine will actually speak out, the sound quality of the voice is absolutely horrible. I had my wife sitting right next to me and I asked her to try to identify some of the words I had the machine speak out, she could not guess even one of them. Also, the actual definitions that come out for some of the words are really bad. Over all, it's not worth the money."
4,Almost perfect,"As one of the more exotic McFarlane dragons, this is one of my favorites. The assembling process wasn't too much of a hassle.Standing 10-inch tall with the base, I like how dominating it is over my other McFarlane dragons. I think the paint job could have been done a little better. The blue color on my dragon is really light--almost white, and the web between the spikes of its arms and legs are almost brown, not human skin-color like shown in Amazon's picture.Another negative point about this dragon is that due to packaging, its long tail and its legs are bent to tightly tie the dragon to the box. So, the dragon looks bent out of shape after unpacking. The good thing is these dragons are made of very durable plastic, so you can bend them the way you want them but that may take some time.The base is lightweight but surprisingly holds the figure well...no wobbling."
3,Doesn't display worth a darn!!!!,"This dragon I think is very nicely sculpted however, I don't think they took much time working on the base. When I opened my dragon and placed the metal rod into the base, it stuck out at a 45 degree angle. Instead of the rod going up and down it stuck out at a horrible angle. When I attached the dragon to it, it would just pull the base down. I even tried bending the rod, that just made it swing to the side. I have the dragon now leaning against the side of my shelf in order to keep it in the air. Whoever drilled thw hole in my base drilled it crooked. Lets just say it looked better in the package then what it does now leaning way over on its base!"
4,The purple and black attack,"I bought Skywarp as a seperate item from some selling it on here. I wasn't really worried about getting Ultra Magnus, since I was just collecting all of the decepticon jets which turned out to be a nice addition."
5,THIS ZOID KICKS BUT,"Konig Wolf is such a cool zoid. It took me 4 hours to build. It's got awesome guns on its back and a cool ""microscope"" cover you can slip over it's eyes. U HAVE TO GET THIS ZOID!!!!"
5,Konig Wolf,This is a great zoids first of all. I gave it a five because you have so much fun building it and playing with it. Some people might think it is boring to play with. The five in education is because it teaches how joints move and makes them study and stay focused to something.This is very durable. Once i dropped it... not one piece fell off or snapped.I do not reccomend this for any people who want to get this as their first zoid. It is very complicated.Hope this was helpful.=)
3,Better off with something else,"I chose the ZipCD for the pretty good burn stats & the software; however, Adaptec Easy CD Creator crashed every time I started the program. Something of a downer... I did switch to using Nero for a while, which worked perfectly (the ZipCD burned audio/data just as advertised, no coasters.) But - I have no desire to pay another 50 bucks for Nero when the burner should have come with working software. I finally got Easy CD to work, after reinstalling Windows, disabling DMA access for the drive, etc. Seems likely that the drive/software has problems with DMA on a Ultra 66 connection. Anyway, technical help was helpless, and I'm tired of dinking with the drive. I found a better deal elsewhere, I'll be returning it."
4,The Golden Years,"Yes this is lip-synced. But it also it Motorhead at their peak and it is one of the very best clips of them, especially from the early days. Only 3 tracks yes, but wonderfully filmed and the three tracks are Ace Of Spades, Motorhead, and Please Dont Touch with Girlschool flailing around with them and having a blast.With all due respect to the other reviewer, I think this is some of the choiciest choice Motorhead. I say GET IT!I gotta say though that the menus are a little buggy!"
1,"Trust me, this is no good","I am a HUGE Motorhead fan. They are one of, if not my absolute favorite band of all time. I don't recommend the EP DVD because it's only 3 songs, lip synched. There are no live performances or extra Motorhead footage on this DVD, just 3 lip synch songs by Lemmy, Phil, and Fast Eddie with one song co-lip-synched with Girlshcool (Please Don't Touch). If you want a great Motorhead DVD, get Stage Fright, which is awesome, and live. I paid $15 for the EP and was very disappointed."
3,Good inspiration...,This book was well written with good details and imagery. This book let me know that my passion for working with inner city youth is shared among others
5,Good book,"A good book about a teacher deciding to stay at an inner city school rather than go onto a better paying and more ""prestigious"" position."
4,Reading Club Book,Have not finished reading yet but others who have read it in my group say it is wonderful and very enlightning. I am please with what I have read
1,I chose to waste my money,"Having seen Mr. Thomas-El's name is the local paper, I thought that I would purchase his book. Big mistake. Could Mr. Thomas-El have tooted his own horn any louder? What makes his story so very different from thousands of other African-American men? Poor,raised by a single parent, absentee father, first family member to graduate from college, blah, blah, blah. I'm not hating on the brother but I still wonder why he felt the need to share."
5,Differential Diagnosis - prescription: must reading,"Goodman and Snyder have compiled a very readable text on differential diagnosis. There are numerous illustrations and tables to augment the text. Important concepts are presented several times to reinforce their importance to the reader. This text would be a valuable addition to any physical therapist's library, especially those therapists who routinely receive ""evaluate and treat"" referrals from nonspecialists."
4,A good supplement book for massage therapists,"This is a good supplemental book for professional massage therapists and bodyworkers as it lists symptoms that are mimicked by several conditions with the major concentration on musculoskeletal conditions as well as some systemic conditions. Is that back pain or a kidney infection? Learn to tell the difference with this book by being able to ask the client more questions to narrow it down. I would like to have seen it as a thicker, more comprehensive text. It's about 1 inch or more thick."
2,Disapointed....,The shipping was quick and the price was right but the color and fit of the floor mat is poor. The description claims the color to be an EXACT MATCH to the Factory color but its not even close! To get this to fit I put it in the best I could and used it for a few weeks. After Being broke in it still has a poor fit. I would go with a factory floor mat if I had to do it again!
2,Too little card for Too much money,It's an alright card buy my friend bought a visiontek geforce2gts for [a lot] less and it scores the same in the benchmarks. I feel robbed. You can find just as good for much less.
1,Magna Bug Stinks,"I bought 2 of these for my 2 sons (ages 5 & 7) for Christmas this year. Both boys LOVE bugs. They both thought these looked pretty cool in the box. They both lost interest VERY quickly. My 7 year summed it up, ""This isn't much of a toy."" 'Nuf said."
4,Worked out great,"I used these as dessert plates for a large family gathering. They're on the smaller side, but worked out great. They're quite sturdy and didn't get soggy. Excellent replacement for Styrofoam, plastic or other paper plates. Will be using these from now on."
4,Suspenseful - Or - Tedious?,"As soon as you open this book, you are swirled into suspense. But after about 300 pages, the reader starts to wonder if the story is EVER going to be told, or indeed, go anywhere at all. And I'm not truly sure it does. What starts out like a Robin Cook/Dean Koontz style novel, descends into more of a ""Stepford Wife"" story, characters that just don't seem to really live and breathe. The loose ends are all tied up a little too neatly for credibility and the circumstances leading up to the story are a little too full of coincidence. 4 stars or 3? Hard to decide..."
3,Good story but.....,"It was very long and drawn out. For about 250 pages I felt like I kept reading the same thing over and over again. It was very repetitive and didn't add anything new to the story. Also - don't read the prelude! I figured out the premise of the book very quickly thanks to too much given away in the prelude. Ended nicely, but too drawn out and predictable."
1,Are You Kidding Me?,"This album is an insult to The Offspring. As I write this review, I am listening to ""A Guitar Tribute to the Offspring,"" and it is hard for me to even imagine why anyone (including myself) purchase this album. And yes, there is a reason I am having such a visceral reaction:1. The music sounds like it was produced using a drum kit and some random commercial vocals.2. There is no warmth/life to the cold, dry ""music"" that was once alive on the true Offspring albums.3. Why reinvent the wheel? If you are going to trouble yourself with a Tribute Album, then be creative. Don't just try and be a carbon copy."
4,1987,"That was the year Tuxedomoon had their 10 Years anniversary tour and this program was shown before the concert. This is why it consists of many, mostly short, recordings taped throughout those first ten years.I'm not 'completely' sure, well, it was 20 years ago, but some sequences I remember clearly. It was a pleasant surprise, when almost immediately memories of that great concert came back to my mind again.Who is expecting a concert recording or some sort of music video, probably will be disappointed.Whoever is aware that what is shown here are places that were important to Tuxedomoon (e.g. SF), snapshots in studios, silliness on the road, will watch this rather short DVD (32 mins.) several times.If you even have seen this back then, you will deeply enjoy it the first time for (good) nostalgia alone."
3,Keep on pumping and injecting.,"I was I avid wrestling fan in the 80's, yes I was. But, it seems like the fizz of it went stale for me now-a-days. At one time it used to be good entertainment for me and I used to think that somehow it might be real, you know. I just isn't the same for me anymore. It's now all steriods and steriods and steriods and more steroids."
5,"Not what I expected, thank goodness!","A good book covering terms like cladding, telecommunications etc. Perfect for your little sturctural engineer!"
2,a women's comic Book,"I my self am a Doomsday fan , but there is a lot to be said about Doomsday coming back in here , after superman death and come back , and doomsday complete and ultimate Arase of space & time , it?s hard to swallow doomsday with Brainiac brain , also the fabric of an infant and 40 cows mixed on this story is less then I could care for .however the graphics are fine , the story line is amusing ( even if it?s a more a mushy mushy women?s comic book then men?s) and that only disserve 2 stars in my book ."
1,Y'all need therapy.,"Give me a freakin' break. I can't believe any man would fall into such [junk], and actually buy into this. Men wake the [heck up] before you turn yourself into the monsters society is pushing you to be."
1,WRONG WRONG and WRONG,"If you all spent more time listening to women and talking to them openly about this, you would find out way more than this book will ever tell you - and unlike this book, it will be the truth.Women don't like jerks. Sometimes they wind up dating them because the guy has two sides and it confuses the woman.Again, women don't like jerks. But they do like a man who can stand up for himself, knows who he is and is comfortable enough with himself. Women like a man who commands respect but also knows how to show respect.Women wind up with jerks because of low self-confidence and because the jerk is manipulative. Women do not go seeking jerks."
3,"A little rambly at times, but interesting","Shark uses a lot of story-telling and examples. Sometimes, the points he's trying to make with the examples are factually wrong, and that's a little annoying.The book is an excellent introduction on how to turn one's self into an operant conditioning mechanism. In order to train an animal, the best way is to use intermittant rewards. The nice-guy fails because in his eagerness to please he rewards all the time.My advice would be to read this book, chapter for chapter, backwards. I understand his layout, but conceptually it makes a little more sense to start with the finished product and work backwards into the specifics."
2,Unfortunate,"I largely agree with the viewer from Durham. This is just a horrible production, except for the sound, which is excellent. Ms. Monheit is not untalented, but she's very young, and it shows in this production. Her stage presence is what you might expect from a 21-year-old, and few 21-year-olds are ready for the Rainbow Room. Neither is Ms. Monheit. The clumsy, frenetic direction of this program just makes things worse. I like Ms. Monheit. I've enjoyed her CDs. I hope she matures as a singer. But this DVD was a big disappointment. (Apparently the viewer from New York thinks only New Yorkers as sophisticated as he/she is should write reviews of great talent like Jane Monheit. Excuuuuse me for being from ""the boondocks"" (which from the perspective of New Yorkers is, I guess, the entire remainder of the United States). This is still a mediocre performance and a lousy production.)"
1,West Coaster,"I am sorry to say that I too did not enjoy the Jane Monheit DVD. I purchased it and would give it away... I am in Las Vegas and whether you are in blue jeans or a tux... Talent is talent. The Las Vegas reviewer is in the entertainment business. One reviewer said Jane Monheit graduated from ""one of the best music schools"" does not matter the DVD is awful. We have other CD's of Jane Monheim and they are OK... She needs management and help..."
3,More like a 2.5,"See my other reviews - I LOVE Jane, but I am honest.She's beautiful, she's charming, but the preponderance of material from the ""In The Sun"" CD here just leaves me lacking...Longing for MY Jane, the ""Come Dream With Me"" and ""Never Never Land Jane...Come back to me, Jane. This new stuff just isn't doing it for me, my darling"
1,"Boring, boring, boring","After watching this performance, it went immediately into a box for donation to the local used bookstore. Monheit was a big disappointment. Why not create a DVD of Wendy Lands or someone else who shows some real feeling?"
2,not quite the real thing,"jane is quite good but for me she's missing something critical. for me she's not really telling the story on the songs, she's simply singing them....hard for me to believe Jane Monheit in these songs. One of the reasons Krall is so great is that she is believeable - Krall's melancholy and sadness feels 100% real. Jane just probably needs to live her a life a while longer....."
2,Cheese Whiz,"O.K. how can anyone compare this DVD to Diana Krall? PLEASE. They couldn't be more opposite:Diana Krall = talented / Jane = lameDiana Krall = cool / Jane = awkwardDiana Krall = stylish / Jane = garishDiana Krall DVD = reference quality / Jane's DVD = mediocreWatching this made me feel squeamish. It was so cheesy in every aspect. I mean this DVD is painful to watch.Audio quality = fairVideo quality = goodOverall = Worthy of a stale Ritz cracker and the smell of old mothballs.Again, whoever compared this to Diana Krall's reference quality and stylish DVD ought to have their ears and eyes checked. Not to mention their sense of style."
5,I recomend it highly! WOW!,"WOW! That's all I can say is WOW. I love this dvd, I keep one at my beach condo and one at home, I recomend it highly, give this dvd and a bottle of wine to a jazz lover, or any lover(ha, ha), and they'll love it. I'm filthy rich so I bought ten of them and gave them out to everyone in my family. Buy it today."
2,Give me strength . . .,"Jane Monheit has no business whatsoever interpreting songs for which she is completely inadequate to interpret. She is the exact opposite of Billie Holiday - a voice that is entirely unearned. There is no life behind her voice, no understanding of the feeling behind the lyrics. She sounds like some girlscout auditioning for an Iowa High School Talent Show."
2,Pretty lame stuff,"I bought this DVD expecting to hear music similar to Diana Krall or maybe Nora Jones. Was I ever disappointed. This lady can't seem to find the notes. And, although I guess she's pretty, you couldn't tell because she's hidden under so much makeup. Oh well, I guess one lives and learns. Don't buy something based on reviews and genre alone. Sample it first. Duh!"
2,"And Julie London sold a lot of albums with her looks, too","Undeniably looks good in makeup, but not a jazz singer. The jazz vocal of Tea For Two belongs to Anita O'Day, and Monheit will never take that away from her. Monheit sings through the nose, and definitely does not have the musicality to use scat in Hit the Road to Dreamland. She ended up off-key. Maybe in 10 years she'll have the maturity.....If she wants to continue cabaret, she should listen to Nancy LaMott, a true musician."
2,Some thoughts,"I don't have this DVD. I saw her on PBS and my first impression, confirmed throughout her performance, is that she's a Linda Ronstadt knockoff. I'm posting this because I didn't see that point in any of the reviews.Yes she has a voice, not an amazing voice, but respectable enough, her intonation is good and she can manages some respectable vocalese.But not an artist, IMO. The only identity I hear is Linda Ronstadt. Where's Jane Monheit?Another thing I noticed is that she doesn't take advantage of her accompaniment. She saturates the texture, and spaces her phrasing in such a way that there's very little extra room. Some judicious use of silence would help."
1,great deception,Very bad.A cantora foi uma grande decepo para mim. Esforou-se em tirar a beleza das musicas que cantou. No consegui ouvir até o fim. Costaria de poder devolver o CD. Nem os excelentes musicos conseguem salvar o Cd. Very bad.
5,Excellent Wine Cooler! Elegant and Simple.,"This wine cooler exceeded my expectations. I wanted something simple, yet elegant, that can be placed on the dining table.This cooler does the trick! It is very sleek and elegant, and most importantly, produces absolutely no condesation! Not one drop of water will touch the table. It lasts a long time, you can drink a whole bottle calmly and be relaxed to know that it will stay cool throughout. I prefer to cool the wine in the fridge first, and then use the cooler to keep the temperature constant a long time.It is also very portable and can be taken to any room in the house, with absolutley no hassle.What is also very important is that it needs no batteries or wires (wires cannot be placed on a dining table).I'm not sure if it would keep two bottles cooled back-to-back, haven't tried it yet, but if it doesn't, you can simply buy another ice pack and keep both of them in the freezer!I recommend this product 100%!"
3,Don't forget to put it in your freezer,"I suppose I was a bit dismayed, but that's my own fault. This is a nice chiller to keep your already-chilled wine in on the table or counter. You just have to remember to put the whole container in the freezer so it gets chilled up itself. However, it won't stay chilled longer than 30 minutes soooooooo.... I've seen better ones that have a ""chill pack"" that gets almost frozen and is inserted into the wine cooler. Those seem to work much better, unless you are chugging your wine."
2,has no insulation,"I was disappointed in this item because it has no insulation. For me the greater need is to keep a bottle cool thruout the meal. This will do that OK, but then don't expect it to cool down that second bottle you had not planned on drinking. I'm planning to keep my eye out for one of those foam covers people use on beer bottles, but in a size big enough for wine bottles."
3,Nice Looking,"This is a nice looking Wine Cooler, simple and sleek style, but after my first trial, I'm not sure it does exactly what it claims in terms of taking a bottle from the shelf and cooling it in 5 minutes or even longer for that matter. I'm with the other reviewers in thinking it may work well to keep a pre-chilled bottle of wine cool, but it just not quite enough to chill a bottle straight from the wine rack. I still like it because I am enjoying collecting wine accessories and am attracted to the stainless steel design."
5,Great for Account Managment,One of the best books for account managment. Really helped us in developing our model.
1,"Identity of "" Cincinnatus""","The author's identity was ""revealed by Col. Harry Summers ( with the help of Washington Post publisher and Vietnam veteran Donald Graham) to be Cecil Currey, a chaplain in the U.S. National Guard who had never served in Vietnam"" as per B.G. Burkett in his book ""Stolen Valor"". Take the book jacket description of the author as a ""senior field-grade officer"" at the Pentagon and it's damning indictment of the Army's performance in Vietnam with a very large grain of salt!!!"
2,it bent !,received in time.was unable to separate the ball joint using it and when applied force the prongs bent. it seems like it is made from a softer metal than it should be. had to rent one from O'Reilys. the once rented from O'Reilys was heavier and solid.
4,The countdown begins.......,"This collection of NE hits contains some tracks ""once in a lifetime groove"" and the ""NE heartbreak"" remix I have not heard in a good minute. New Edition really needs a box set that covers the 20 years of hits they put out as a group as well as the solo hits. I'm looking foward to the new album due later this year."
2,"Every Song Available on Better N.E. ""Gold"" Compilation","Every song on this CD is also available on the two disc New Edition ""Gold"" compilation which for $3 more is a better deal."
4,tight collection,"i've always dug New Edition. there songs have always been on point and they always kept there sound up to point to what was happening. from the 80's through 90's New Edition didn't miss a Beat. there vocal harmony and balance of Up-tempo and Slow Jams always works. MR. Telephone Man,If it isn't love, cool it now, candy girl,etc..... this collection captures them really well. a very tight set. New Edition is One of the Baddest Vocal Groups Ever."
3,It Ok!,"But ""Greatest Hits Vol 1"" is better. It may contain less songs, but at least they are all known. More of the favorites like ""popcorn love"" and ""Is this the end"" are on it. This set includes more of the recent songs a couple that I never heard on the radio. How can they be considered greatest hits if they wee not played on the radio?"
4,The Best NE Hits Collection By Far,"New Edition remains one of the most influential R&B; groups of the past 20 years. So it was only right that they get a proper Greatest Hits set. Hence, ""Hits"", which is their story in 17 solid tracks.If I had to do without any of these tracks, it would be ""Once In A Lifetime Groove"" (cute, but not necessary), and replace it with ""Boys To Men"" (remixed version). On the other hand, The remix of N.E. Heartbreak is an added bonus. I also would've rather had the album version of ""If It Isn't Love"".Otherwise, this is the best New Edition Hits collection by far."
5,Great for what it's intented,"Talk about easy...Plug the thing in to the top of your iPod (either the full-size or a mini), set it to an empty radio station, and go!As mentioned in other reviews, this FM transmitter is subject to the physics of frequency modulation, just like any wave medium. As long as you have your iPod volume set to 50-75% (as recommended by the instructions), you will have no problems.This is a great tool for long road trips, or areas with poor radio reception. As long as you understand the limitations of FM radio, you won't regret having this item as an indispensable iPod accessory."
4,"No cable required - Use any FM radio,","I love this really great device; the freedom it offers me is wonderful. At first I thought it was a radio receiver, but it took my youngest son, Brett, to read the instructions and begin to laugh. He had bested his Pop. ""I know how this works!"" He turned on our home stereo system, adjusted the tuner to an unused FM station, i.e., a station with a lot of static, and simply tuned the AirPlay to the same station, and pressed play on the iPod to hear the sound coming out of our home stereo. I tested this within my car, in other parts of the house, and outside on the deck. All work perfectly. The AirPlay is the best product for its cost!"
2,very annoying feedback-like hum...,"I don't get the hum all the time, but that almost makes it more annoying. Everything will be working fine for a couple of minutes and then the hum will start. Sometimes tapping on the antenna with your finger seems to break up what sounds like a feedback loop. Sometimes changing the orientation of the iPod helps. Sometimes changing the volume helps. However, nothing seems to make the hum go away consistently. On the bright side the hum is so annoying that I've never noticed the static that some people complain about with these transmitters.I wonder if the manufacturer has quality control problems because some people really like these and I've seen good reviews from places like ilounge.com, but I can't stand the hum on mine and am looking for a replacement. Unfortunately, from what I read, it doesn't seem like any of these FM transmitters work particularly well."
2,Not Enough Transmission Power,"I purchased this item after reading the dissapointing reviews on the Griffin iTrip, When received, I found it easy to set up, but the output on both my standard Car FM Stereo and also my Home FM Tuner was very disappointing, sounded more like a distant AM station with a constant hiss. If you turn the iPod volume up the signal clears a little but the output starts to distort especially the Bass. If you are not a sound perfectionist then this product will be just OK, If you are an Audiophile then look elsewhere like the Griffin (Full Featured and high powered) RoadTrip also here at Amazon."
1,Disappointing,"I plugged this in and all I got was a hole bunch of static, a high-pitched whine, and the music playing vaguely in the background. After playing with it for a whole day with no success, on every radio station channel available (88.1 has worked for years where I live for my FM-modulated CD player without a single issue, but not so with the AirPlay), I called the customer service number. They were nice, and are supposed to be sending me a replacement to see if that works better. I'm not holding my breath. Meanwhile, I got the iTrip and it works much better - just a little static here and there, but it can usually be fixed by fiddling with the iPod's volume. It's a shame because I liked the compact style and easy tuning of the AirPlay, but it just seems like the product isn't up to par with the good old iTrip."
1,Avoid the Airplay if you live anywhere near civilization...,"this thing is awful, it's impossible to find a free station (i live in Philly) and when you do the sound is terrible. certain bass frequencies distort and fuzz out, and there is a persistent high pitched whine behind the music. unlistenable."
3,Good till it lasts ...,"I bought teh Air Play some 3 months ago. It worked ok (not too gr8 but served the purpose) until recently all of a sudden it stopped working. It hadn't fallen down or anything. Just one fine day, it seems it decided that it needs to take a break and has not worked since.I have no clue what and why it stopped working, but there it is, now lying like a piece of junk."
1,Terrible Range,"I recently purchased the AirPlay to replace my iTrip transmitter that broke. I wanted to see if there was something better out there than the iTrip, which I rated 3 stars. The range on the AirPlay is so bad that even with a frequency clear of interference, the AirPlay signal could not be picked up by my vehicle's mast antenna when AirPlay was in the front seat, only 3 or 4 feet from the antenna. When the signal was found by my radio, it was plagued by loud pops and very low volume. I have since purchased the much larger Sonnet PodFreq transmitter, and although it is very large, the sound quality, volume and range can't be beat."
4,Pretty good,"I've had my XtremeMac AirPlay for about two weeks. So far I'm pretty happy with it. It is very easy to use. I purchased it mainly to use at home. I've tried it in the car but there was so much interference that I've gone back to using my cassette adapter. I really like the small size of the AirPlay. The sound quality is good enough for me to listen to music or audiobooks while I work in the kitchen, etc. There is some interference but it isn't too bad and it pretty much gets drowned out by the dishwasher and the kids :). The main problem with this product (and I assume similar products) is that it's hard to find a clear FM station here in the SF Bay Area! I recommend this product - if you don't expect perfect sound you won't be disappointed."
2,Know what generation your IPod is,"This unit may work fine, but not on the IPod I have. The description provided led me to believe it would work, but I have the wrong kind of IPod. That is probably why this was so cheap - it's a real old product. Apple doesn't make it that easy to figure out what you have either. I finally did and ordered another product. So, if you're looking for a transmitter, be very sure you know what kind of IPod you have before ordering."
2,Suceptible to interference,"Being able to adjust frequency ""on-the-fly"" is great but the unit is suceptible to interference. Like one reviewer said, the reception was full of static until I put my hand near the unit, which seemed to help. I returned the Xtreme Airplay and replaced it with an iTrip. Much clearer in the same situations...save yourself the hassle I went through and go with the original."
1,Did not work,"It did not work clearly in my car. The sound quality was not good, it was not clear at all. Finally I choose Griffin FM transmitter and it worked well, it looks like I am hearing music system at home. I loosed 25$ to purchase this."
1,Disappointed,"I simply couldn't get this item to work. The first time I tried I got a faint signal, but all attempts after that were futile. I do live in an ""over radioed"" market for one thing. That is to say, we have a lot of signals jamming the FM band, and that may have had something to do with it."
1,"nice idea, bad engeneering",This transmitter makes your ipod tunes go directly to your radio with the clarity of a poorly tuned am station. If you place your ipod with the transmitter directly on top of whatever sterio you wish to play your music you may be lucky enough to get a crackly sounding signal. Don't waste your money.
2,Not the way to a clear signal,"Now, it may just be because I have an older model car (1992) with a so-so radio, but the AirPlay FM transmitter just doesn't provide enough umph to ever get a clear signal to my radio, no matter where I place it in my car. I live in a very rural area, which means that there are quite a few fuzzy ""unused"" stations that should provide good channels for the Airplay, but it still doesn't give a clear signal. The worst part about it is that the bass signal is the worst to come through, so if you listen to any bass heavy music it's gonna sound like crap. Shouldn't have bought this, and instead should have waited till I could afford a new head unit with an RCA audio in jack so that I could just hardwire my iPod into my car stereo (which will give the best signal period)."
2,Just another piece-a junk,"You know for a person with keen ear for music, this is a disappointment. This is compact, sits well on an iPod, but....that is not sufficient. The transmission quality is poor just like the others. It is hard to shoot that kinda power with a teenie-weenie gadget like this or iTrip. It didnt shoot well even at 5ft distance, but they claim 10 to 30 feet. It was poor even with a booster antenna. Weak, noisey, it is like walking around while talking on a cellphone in a bunker...Hey...you are breakin up....you are breakin up...just stand there dont move...kinds. So, $40 is a lot. May be if it were $10/15 you could fool around a little. Good effort though.I sent mine back!!"
2,High-pitched whistle extremely annoying,"The AirPlay does what it is supposed to do but there is a high-pitched whistle when I use it in my car that is so annoying I don't even use it anymore. It doesn't matter what the ipod volume is or what station it's tuned to. While I suppose it would be good to have in a crunch, there has got to be a better way to listen to your ipod in the car."
1,no bargain,"The XtremeMac AirPlay FM Transmittter is only for really old iPods. They don't tell you this little nugget of information on the page. This device works with iPods that Apple considers obsolete. If you have a very old iPod, in mint condition, then this device will work for you and nothing made over the last five years. I tried to not assign a ""star"" in the rating system and I could not get this posted without putting something in the star system. If I had my way there would be ""No stars"" on this item."
1,Doesn't work here.. doesn't work there...,"I live in Los Angeles.. and there aren't ANY free stations here that allow this product to work. Can't use it in the car or at home.Then I went to visit a friend in Sweden.. figured I'd have better luck using it there, but no.. same problem. The iPod broadcast is fuzzy and intermittent at best.I'm sure the item would work outside any populated area.. or not."
1,wrong item,"I received the incorrect item too. The band that was delivered had a gold, rounded buckle; and was a much darker brown that the one pictured. Looks like they are having trouble identifying their items."
2,Wrong Item,"I received the item in a timely manner, and it's a nice band- but it isn't the one pictured. The band that was delivered had a gold, rounded buckle; and was a much darker brown that pictured."
5,Another dysfunctional family,"First time authors tend to write about what they know, so I will asume that it is true in this situation. If so, the author had a somewhat unusual family, particularly his parents. His siblings and friends weren't too particularly normal either, but reading about all of them was good fun. Mixing in television shows and records from the early 70s gave a good grounding in time, and the narrator's voice had an authentic sound. It's a quirky little novel, and I enjoyed reading it very much."
4,A Entertaining read!,"I found this book delightful. I have four young boys and recommend this book to anyone else with sons, brothers, husbands, and nephews! The book was entertaining, funny and sorrowful. It grasped the life of families in suburbia and brought me back to my own childhood."
5,In the Cherry Tree,I enjoyed this book. The characters were vivid and the story was engaging. I especially liked the beautiful way that Mr. Pope wrote it from a boy's point of view with such clarity. It was a great read and is a wonderful addition to American literary tradition.
5,"10 Minutes A Day, That's All I Ask","An incredible debut. I was swept up in the narrative of this book. The attention to detail is nothing less than amazing. And the best part of all is that, even if you weren't around in the summer of '74, or didn't live in suburban Connecticut, or didn't have parents at each others' throats day in and day out, you still relate to this twelve year old kid because Dan Pope has reconstructed a slice of childhood probably better than any I've read before. It's that moment in the cusp between the carefree days of childhood and the angst of teenage life that he has captured here. It will be extremely disappointing if this novel doesn't eventually make its way onto the screen. It's every bit as engaging and precise as Stephen King's ""The Body"" (later turned into one of the greatest ""coming of age"" movies ever made, Stand By Me)."
4,Accurate memories.....and not all of them good....,"I am surprised this book isn't getting more recognition. Adult authors frequently try to recapture the memories of their adolescence or write from the perspective of a teenager, some with great results (Catcher in the Rye, Russell Banks' Rule of Bone, and best of all, CD Payne's Youth in Revolt), some mixed (Tom Petotta's Bad Haircut). I think Dan Pope has written an important period piece that recalls growing up in the 70s, warts and all. While the book generally reads more like a series of short stories, there is continuity and character development. Sensitive topics, such as parental infidelity and suicide are addressed without pulling punches, yet Pope clearly has a great sense of humor, from the hand farts of a big sister's friend to tongue twisters concerning the fig plucker's son. In The Cherry Tree is worth picking up and knocking off in a few nights of bedtime reading. I look forward to Dan's next book."
2,disappointing,"I was very disappointed with this book. I thought it had very little substance. While it did take me back to my childhood, too much time was spent listing what actors the characters were watching on TV, what the TV episodes were about, or what music was on the radio and not enough time dealing with their actual lives. I thought this book skimmed the surface of a lot of important issues."
5,Scientific approach to people skills,I highly recommend this book for the following reasons:1)The authors are PhD in Psychology and their viewpoints are backed by empirical psychological studies. You won't find BS management theories in this book.2)Very few pages are wasted. The authors apparently do not believe in writing fillers to sell a thicker book for a higher price.3)The scientific approach to dealing with different management types is refreshing. It is not something that is found in most leadership/management books.4)The book is helpful even if you are not in managment. The theories and suggestions outlined in this book can apply to one's personal life.
3,Another 2 X 2 Personality Grid book,"I enjoyed The Platinum Rule better.LTPS may have been the original? or one of the early ones, and in on its 3rd re-worked title, but I got that been there done that feeling.There are too many books in my library, and this one is off to the used bookstore. It's not a bad book, but how many 2 X 2 type grid books does a person need!"
5,"""Magic"" is right!!!!","I consider myself a very musically diverse person and have listened to things that my friends STILL have never heard of. My mom had a very unique record collection and I was introduced to them at an early age. My absolute favorite album of hers was The 5th Dimension's ""The Magic Garden."" I can remember sitting in my closet with headphones on just absorbing the music. This concept album is just beautiful. The singing, the instrumentals, the lyrics, everything is pure perfection. It's a comfort album and it's about the only reason that I have a turntable hooked up to my system! The CD is great, but for some nostalgia I still enjoy the popping and hissing of the original vinyl. Don't miss an opportunity to embrace this album."
4,5th D and Jimmy Webb,"Overall great CD. I like 60's concept CD's. It is interesting to me to hear what people who had a platform to say something, say something. Moving the time line up....how would Jimmy Webb and Swing Out Sister sound?"
3,A voice like Nick Cave,"This guy sings a lot like a Celtic Nick Cave at some points. Unfortunately while he sings well, the instrument portion is out of tune and off key."
4,Happy buyer,"I have had my Sony Cybershot DSC T100 8mp for over 6 months now, and love every minute using it. It does eveything that the reviewers say it will do (and more). The picture quality and ""ease of use"" are excellent, and the 3"" LCD screen is just fantastic. It replaces an older model Sony Cybershot that I have, and I couldn't be more pleased. It is compact and has all that you would every want in a digital camera. I purchased it from Amazon. It arrived on time, and the price was the lowest in the market."
2,Dissapointed,"I'm what you call one of the loyal Sony customers and this is my third Sony digital camera. I was extremely happy with the previous two I've had, but I'm very much disappointed with this model! Sony traditionally has very great features (as with this camera), however what is unacceptable is that Flash photography with this model totally sucks -- 95% of shots with Flash appear with Red Eye (although Red Eye reduction is turned on), and WORST of all, photos appear with huge white spots (Sony comments this as dust particles in the air - I don't care what they are, I've never had huge white spots in my photos and this is simply unacceptable)!! Unfortunately, photos very often get blurry as well (somebody mentioned steady shot? doesn't work on this one)! This camera is simply not worth the money, for the similar amount you can get 7 M-pixel Sony P200 that doesn't have these issues..."
5,Failure,"Mostly I love this camera. I do have one complaint. The macro mode button is easy to bump and when you switch off the camera and then switch it back on it will return to the macro mode. It is easy to be in the macro mode when you do not want to be. Also, yesterday the camera just stopped working for no apparent reason."
3,Okay camera...there is better out there,"Some of my pictures come out blurred no matter how steady I hold the camera. The steady shot seems to do nothing. The shutter speed is a lot faster than my old digital, so that I like. The pictures that don't come out blurred come out great."
3,"Almost nice, some flaws","The screen on this camera is lovely although it results in a larger camera body than some of the competition. The image stabilization features work nicely and do their job well.In video mode, I was pleased that the zoom worked while shooting video.My major problem with it was that it would ""hunt"" focus in video mode when using auto-focus. For example, upon just shooting some trees in the distance (nothing in the foreground), it would drift in and out of focus. I don't know if this was something wrong with my particular camera or a design flaw but I returned the camera because of it.Also, I found the lens position on the camera problematic. Myself and many others (the people you hand your camera to to take a picture) would hold the camera in a way that a finger would sneak into the top of the picture. Cameras (including other Sony's) that have the lens in the middle of the camera don't have that problem."
1,another Sony dud,"this is my third camera from the cybershot series (unfortunately I keep getting them as a gift) and the problems with them just gets worse and worse. I get the white spots all over my pictures, red eye in almost all low light pictures, about 80% of my pictures are blurry and people and bright colors are pretty washed out. 100% of my pictures have to be retouched and fixed on photo editing software.The nice part about the cybershot series was that is was so compact, this one doesn't really have that good point as it is the size of most cameras out fight now at about $200.The camera is so not worth getting at virtually any price and I would go for a nikon, fuji etc.. instead. I'm so disappointed because I looked at the reviews and they were pretty good. I didn't find the camera to perform at an even satisfactory level. Hopefully I can get rid of it and get another one soon."
2,serious design problem,"Yes it is sharp, the big screen is perfect, and it works amazingly under low illumination condition. BUT, it has some serious problem to its (I think is) auto white balance. It is worse than my old p5.Whenever I took picture with large area of bright surface - sunny or cloudy sky, or even light-colored wall exposed to sunshine - but a person's face is not directly exposed to sun shine, the face becomes completely dark. I don't think the focus area has any effect on this. I can't not understand why even I put the face in the center of the screen, and the person to be taken picture is very close to the camera (yes, a big face), the result is still the same!!! That sucks.I am a person who loves to take pictures under the sun, say 80% of my pictures. This problem could prevent me to take good picture for at least 40% of the time!! This is way beyond acceptable!"
5,Carnival Strippers,"Looked to be a great book. I got it for my brother telling him to let me read it after he was done with it. I still haven't got to read it, I may have to get one for myself."
2,"The only one in its class, but...","Interesting that this is the only book besides the Boutell book that discusses C/C++ programming specifically for CGI. But there are many errors in the book that leaves me wondering if it would do more harm than good to use it. It has an emphasis on writing routines that could be better written in a scripting language: no templates or run time typing is used making the C++ code approach pretty out of date. It was a good try and sorely needed in the industry, but alas, it needs competition."
4,Covers the fundamentals of CGI with C/C++ well...,"...but, for one thing, for the price, this book should come with a CD with all the code...it's a huge pain to type all that is given. Also, the C++ classes (of most concern to me) seem to be overly complex, theres a whole load of member functions to replace the amersands in a query string with newlines, and a bunch of other stuff, where a couple of strtok(); functions would have done the job.The main strength of this book is that it teaches you the mechanics of how a compiled C/C++ program for CGI works. The string parsing doesn't take much ingenuity either, you just have to know the format."
2,"Good overview of C++ classes, explanation needs work.","The author goes to a great deal of trouble to create usable (?) code for C++ classes. However, if understanding CGI's in a compiled language is your goal, it won't be fulfilled with this book. While the code is weak in places, the author has gone out of his way to provide patches and e-mail responses to problems. Overall, the code is decent--the writing is not."
3,"It's an o.k. book, some errors in the book","One of the biggest disappointments today in computer books are their inability to write functioning code. There is always something missing or there is actual code error that makes me wonder how important these books are to these writers. For new users, these kinds of errors are nerve racking. Look on page 76 for the main() function in C++ form. When running the code you'll get errors such as:File ""main.cp""; Line 18Error: function 'get_msg' has no prototypebecause get_msg was not previously defined. If my information is incorrect, I'll be more than happy to be corrected.Overall, the book was good at getting the point across. I do recommend an intermediate to advanced programmer to look at this book because it has some code that works correctly."
2,Not what I would call a good book!,"I can't believe I wasted $50.00 on this book.I don't know if the author assumes that if your reading a tutorial on CGI that you have a good deal of knowledge on CGI and it's layout already, or if he just can't write. There was not nearly enough background as far as which files go where, and how they interact, and how to set it up. He just goes write into programming it.I am a senior computer science major and all that is taught is C++ yet, his sample c++ code sucked, and left me confused. It was not at all well explained, and used a style which I was just not familar with.I do not know CGI any more than I did before, it is just an awfully written book."
2,kind of bad,I was really interested in learning about Pablo Escobar but was disappointed. I learned about him somewhat in this film but it still didn't really explained him as a man. The quality of the film was so poor I wish I kept my money.
4,Acrobat 5 Review,"I just finished the last of the book's 14 lessons. I gave this book a four-star rating because some of the lessons keep using the same tools over-and-over again. It took me about 35 minutes to complete each lesson. If you follow all of the steps, you will have no trouble doing it on your own. Part of lesson 3, Adobe PageMaker is used only to save the exercise; but if you skip that part of the lesson, you still could continue to the end. On the whole, I think that all the lessons are easy to learn."
2,My first return.,"I'd never returned a book before, but this one certainly deserved the extra milage. The book plodded along (maybe because of the classroom approach), but what finally convinced me to return it was Page 290, ""Creating eBooks"". After ONE page of self-evident information, the very last paragraph says, ""For more information on designing and creating eBooks, See How to Create Adobe PDF files for eBooks ... available online ......."" The problem of course is that a book that lists for [money] should furnish the information. But what got the book its second pair of walking legs is that the referenced book isn't available... Probably doesn't exist at all. Pick another one. You can spend your money better."
1,UGH!!,"After plodding through many chapters of this book, I am totally exasperated. Not only was the book fraught with errors, but the information was, at best, inadequate. I am an indexer and a Mac user. You cannot create an index in OS X and that is not documented in the book. It is apparent that the authors, Adobe staff, never tested the instructions for the lessons on OS X. in addition, there are too many ""check online for information about xxxx"" references. If i wanted the information online, I would not have purchased a book. The waste of money is small compared to the waste of my time. One star is definitely a high rating for this book."
4,JobSite LST-CTR In-Wall Center Channel Speaker,Good value. Purchased Polk in-wall speakers for my front and rear surround sound. The Polk center channel was nearly $500 so I went with the JobSite instead.Sound is very solid and looks like a perfect match with the Polks. Baffle and grill are paintable. I painted to match my wall color. Grill is a major pain to paint unless you have a sprayer.
3,Great book; terrible quality,"I teach overseas and purchased a copy of this book for each of my students. We love reading through it in class, but each day I need to spend my recess taping pages back into the book. It's a great book, but its quality is horrible!"
5,A must-have for every cat-owner or cat lover !,"Wether you have pure-bred cats or non-pedigree cats this is a great book. It has usefull information like general care, feeding, raising kittens, showing, health care, cat behaviour and lots of great pictures."
4,Spring Snow -- yellow and other colors,"A lovely and intriguing little book, however beware that it is literally a translation in color squares."
4,The Eternal Teenager Again Speaks,"Okay, I confess, I read this strip every day, have for a dozen years, and own this and another Luann anthology, and I admit I'm probably jealous that her ongoing teen years are waaaaaaaaaaay better than my lost and gone forever teen years of mostly self-created angst were, but one thing I still wonder about Luann is why on earth she took so long to get even marginally over Aaron Hill? Hell-ooo, Luann, it ain't happenin', girlfriend! Thankfully it's in the era covered in this collection that Aaron removes himself from Luann's life via a relocation to Hawaii and ends her ongoing torment, but I wish Luann had managed to dump him once and for all for herself and thereby empower her spirit and maybe those of similarly pining teen girls who read along . Okay, done. Off my soap box. If you read Luann, you'll probably like this book, and if you don't, you probably won't. QED. In pace requiescat."
5,Good Product,"For those who do not enjoy making a 'mud puddle' of healthy swallop to drink throughout the day, this is an excellent product for getting barley into your system."
2,Odor,"The mat worked well enough, it was fairly comfortable but it smelled like industrial rubber.I aired it out, washed it as per instructions and after two weeks the odor was still very annoying.When you are doing Yoga there is a lot of time spent with your face close to the mat and, for me at least, the smell or rubber / chemicals takes away from the experience.I sent it back."
4,big improvement,"This is a big improvement over previous mats I've used. It's a little slick when wet, but is improving and is not an issue for me."
5,Best Yoga Mat I Ever Bought,"This is my third yoga mat, and if it ever does wear out, I'll buy the same product. First mat was standard sticky (1/8"" thick). I didn't want to spend much. It was pretty good, but I needed more cushioning. So I bought a thicker one of the same material. I liked it but wore it out quick. I kept seeing this mat in the Hugger Mugger catalog and finally bit. This mat is as tough as a tire, but will provide cushion and support. It's heavier than a sticky mat; I really wouldn't want to have to carry it around the city. Wipes down well. I've had this mat for 3 or 4 years and it's still in excellent condition. I use it at least 4 times a week for yoga, pilates, and balance ball workouts."
1,This movie makes my blood boil.,"The Paperboy was looks like a low budget film. I don't understand why people like it better than ""English Patient"" or ""Titanic"", it just seems like that it didn't take much for it to get 5 stars, and people liked it better. It hurts to be unloved."
2,"Typical, bad, straight to video thriller","This movie was a huge disappointment. I thought the acting form the two leads (Melissa and Johnny) was weak to say the least, although I do agree with the previous review about the puberty squeaks. It was boring and lame."
1,I actually thought this movie was based on the NES game!,I use to play the nintendo game called The Paperboy but then when I heard about this movie I actually thought it was based on the game but it's all about a lonely 12-year-old boy named Johnny who has a crush on his next door neighbor lady who's in her late 30's and is already dating someone and has a kid. I actually thought the movie was horrible and really slow. I couldn't stand watching about a kid who's acting like a bastard just killing people in the neighborhood especially his father. It's such an awful movie don't waste time watching it. The kid in the movie is mentally disturbed.
4,The funniest movie I have ever seen!,"Ok, I know this is supposed to be a scary flick, but oh my gosh it isn't! If you are looking for some good laughs, see The Paperboy! My sisters and I rent it ALL THE TIME and watch it. We can almost recite the whole film! It's not gorey or anything, my 8 year old brother watches it with us and we all get a BIG kick out of it. Marc Marut is the PERFECT paperboy. He is actually a good actor. He is VERY dramatic. And of course everyone knows Alexandra Paul, she was on Baywatch. She is also good in this movie. Please see this movie. I am urging you to! I'm not saying its a bad movie because it is funny and not scary, I'm saying its an even BETTER movie. It is our most favorite movie of all time! It is not really comicly funny, its just intended to be scary, but it turns out funny. But not in a bad way. Its hard to explain so I guess I won't anymore. Just please see tthe Paperboy!"
3,The Second is not like the Third,"My son needed this book for a co-op he is attending that includes Algebra 1/2. Since he is studying Geometry outside of class and only needs the book for in-class discussion, I did not want to spend the money for the latest edition. I read online that the only difference between the two editions is that the Third Edition includes lesson numbers in parentheses on the assignments. However, we have found that some of the lessons are not in the same order, the copy has been rewritten and most of the examples and practice sets are different. Therefore, this book is not really helpful for our purposes. However, if you are doing Algebra 1/2 at home, without a co-op, obtaining a Second Edition set would be cost-effective."
1,HORRIBLE!,"Not only was I kicked back from a lack of testing to this book in transition between schools, but as a student with an advanced pace who tends to like math, this was torture. Extremely slow, with way too much review. It teaches the long way through everything. DO NOT BUY!"
2,A combination of EE101 and ECO101.,"cons: It covers a lot of entry level material regarding power system and economics. If you know both power system engineering and economics, it won't be a help since it is too elementary. If you don't know power system or economics, don't expect you can build up a solid background by reading this book.pros: it is good review of EE101 and ECO101.Alert: this book really didn't tell you anything about designing a electricity market: the fundmental incentive compatibility is not covered at all!IT IS JUST A REVIEW BOOK, NOT A GUIDE BOOK YOU CAN DEPENDEND ON FOR MARKET DESIGN ADN ANALYSIS."
4,"Good introduction to electric power economics, engineering","Stoft has provided an excellent introduction to the new world of electric power, providing a helpful guide that speaks to the engineering and the economics."
5,Great - Humerous -,"This book is a wonderful book for teenagers. It is about a young girl. It tells about her trouble and fun times. I really enjoyed this book, and I recommend for you to read it!"
5,A girl that is going through a humourous stage.,I thought that this is a very good book.I got hooked to it and just had to read on. I enjoyed the humor in the book. It made me giggle a lot. I like that in a book. I have a lot of common values with the main character which made me entertained. I would give this book 5 stars. Thanks for your patients. If you like funny books then I recommend this book to either you and young adults. Thank you very much.
1,horrible product.,"Absolute garbage. Product arrived with none of the required screws, bolts, etc to assemble. I went to hardware store to buy them separately because I needed immediately. Product did not work even after assembly. Height could not be adjusted. Pneumatic cylinder is not designed to be secured to base except by gravity, so even if the product did work, the user would not be able to increase height by pulling up on table top, without the entire unit falling apart. Product is also not as pictured. This is starting to become an ongoing issue with adorama product in my opinion."
3,Traditional Catholic Beliefs presented in an easy to read format,"Let me start by saying that I don't disagree with anything Ms. Welborn presents in this book. Maybe my expectations were too high when I purchased this book having read the reviews already posted. While Ms. Welborn presents accurate and traditional Catholic Teachings in this book, I didn't find anything fresh or new. That's not to say that this book isn't well written. I would say, however, that if your looking for a book that tells you that you can have it all to ""live the good life"" you will be disappointed. This book is a sound, matter of fact approach to living with a true Catholic identity. I am glad the Ms. Welborn didn't water anything down and stayed true to the Catholic Churches teachings. It is worth reading as I presents Catholic Theology in an easy and accessible way."
1,Not what I ordered,When I got this product nothing went right. 1st it was not purple it was gray. 2nd when I plugged it in nothing worked. I then contacted the company via email and they told me to return the item with a note in the package stating why i returned it. It has been almost 3 weeks and I still have not received a refund or a replacement product.
5,Memory Card Reader,I bought this for my sister when she told me she didn't have a portal for her SD card. I had a card reader and it is fantastic!!!!! This one is very handy and easy to use and it was so cheap including the shipping....I just couldn't pass it up for her and she love it!!!!
3,Hit and Miss,"I bought a similar item in Hong Kong last year for about US$1.50. Fortunately it has worked well so far.I have read some really angry reviews about the quality or the lack there of on this product. Come on, you get what you pay for. Whenever you buy things from China, manage your expectations and know that at least 30% of the time the stuff is defective and/or flimsy. When you do get things that work well and are durable, praise the Lord for making this happen. I don't take it for granted that I will always get quality just paying pennies."
5,love it!,have bought several of these. they are the greatest for sharing photos at work directly from camera to computer. and also great for using as a storage drive anywhere from 1gb up to 32 or more. have only used up to 32gb sd card in it.
1,does not work with vista or windows 7,mine came defective. the back cover did not close when the card was inside. the front cover was too loose. but also the computer does not recognize it and disconnects it.
1,Might as well throw it in the garbage because I can't use it!,It CLEARLY says that it reads MiniSDs and it only reads SDs - had I read the reviews I would have known that this wasn't what I needed. How can Amazon allow a seller to advertise their items INCORRECTLY!??? Not happy - at all!
5,love it,"so much easier than hooking up a camera to the computer for my camera is picky. you can upload to any computer with this, not just the main one it's used with. it's compact and works wonderfully.only downside is that it's easily misplaced for it's not too large..."
2,Bad product for 16gb SDHC,I bought this product after reading the reviews and thinking it will work on SDHC cards. It worked upto 8gb card which I tested. I have a 16gb SDHC card got toasted because of this reader. the reader cannot read and invalidated my card now. I can't even reformat the card properly! Stay AWAY if you use it with large storage cards.
3,"SD, NOT SDHC!!!","Oops. I also was fooled. I bought the damn thing for use as a SDHC reader to download photos from my Panasonic ZS3 10 MP camera which are about 5 MB each onto a MAC G5. It downloads photos from a Transcend 8GB Class 6 card fine, but it will successfully download the AVCHD lite video only if the original video was just a few seconds long (haven't tried other video formats). Longer videos get stuck at some point. Multiple tries didn't work, had to resort to killing the finder, rebooting, and using the Panasonic cable. Thought I had a bad reader.Note the other review in which someone found it worked for 8 GB card photos but a 16 GB card was screwed up and photos were lost.Somebody tell me why Amazon has so many screwups of this type? (listed as one thing but is not)."
1,Very Poor Quality,"After a couple months, the connection gets very loose and when you plug it into the computer it sometimes doesn't work and you have to wiggle the card. VERY ANNOYING."
1,Very Poor Quality,I ordered 2 of them. I also have 4 other card readers. These 2 both gave errors and would not read my SD card. I had to return them.
1,extremely CHEAP product!! DO NOT BUY!!!!,"The first one of these I received as a wish list gift, and It worked for about 6 months or so, then when it stopped being recognized by my computer, I ordered a new one from the same company (becuz of price, silly me) I think I received that one in June of this year, rarely used it, but now it doesn't work at all, and the replacement they sent BROKE the VERY FIRST TIME I used it!! I will admit, the company is pretty good about sending you replacements, but really??? (think of Amy Poehler's SNL Weekend Update skit)So I guess you get what you pay for, but I'm certainly not risking it on this company again!!!"
2,Adapters conk out,I have used a variety of USB adapters to read my sdhc cards and all of them seem to work OK for awhile but all have eventually stopped working. This one is no exception. I realize it's an inexpensive unit so I'm not out too much to replace it. I wish I knew why these things seem to fail so regularly. Guess I'll just buy a bunch and toss them when they fail.
1,Garbage,"Don't buy this product, just because it's at a good price doesn't mean a good product doesn't work made in china."
3,Generic USB SD Card reader.,Bought this item in 2009 for less than $1I mainly transferred data from 2GB SD Cards with this product which it is excellent at.I however don't use it anymore.
1,Very poor Card Reader,"I have used several different card readers through the years, and this is BY FAR the worst that I have tried. I have two of them, the first one broke inside (which I glued) and it still works, but very SLOW data transfer rates. The second reader was sent to me because the first one broke, but this second reader does not work at all. There are many card readers that are better than this one, so keep looking."
1,Did not read SDHC card,"even though it was advertised as such - it did not read my SDHC card. Worth the price paid, I guess !"
2,had to suck out load,I don't even remember buying the book I must have thrown it in the garbage . . . . .
3,OK game.,"I started playing this game but haven't gotten around to finishing it yet. Never played the multi-player so I can't comment on that aspect of the game. The AI is fairly smart and the dialogue is cool, but it isn't nearly as impressive or engaging as NOLF. Some games I play for a while and then get bored with them and tossed them out. Not sure yet if RTCW will fall into that category."
5,so realistic its scary,"this game is the most realistic ive played in a long time, well all time. The story line is amazing. you can pick chairs up and throw them at people. in each level there are secret places containing medic kits, ammo, etc. the AI is smart too. i went through a door and was being shot and i couldnt find the guy. he was hiding on the wall next to the door and shooting me from behind. multi player.... well ya. it sucks. the guns are unrealistic and i still cant figure out the plot of building towers and stuff. and an added dum part in multi is that people just stand around and shoot mortars everywhere. o yeah i accidentally killed one of my guys with a nade and got banned from the server. what is that??? the single player makes up for it though. overall 4.7/5"
4,one of the best on-line game,"I bought it for online playing.even thought it is a pretty old game, it is still so much fun!!I love this"
1,"If YOU want to play as FPS, don't waste your money...","I bought this game because I really liked Return To Castle Wolfenstein, but didn't realize that the entire game is for online multiplayer crap... If you're looking for single player action, this sure as hell isn't it! Save your money..."
5,"1968, Important Year, Important News Anchor","Excellent documentary on a pivotal year. It's an important year to remember....for many reasons. This doc coincides with Brokaw's new book on the 60s and the baby boomers, ""Boom!"".If you missed this when it aired on the History Channel, you'll want to be sure to see the DVD.Thanks to Mr Brokaw."
1,"Commpletely Unbalanced, typical Brokaw","I had great expectations for this documentary - 1968 is packed full of very interesting events. However, Brokaw missed a chance to make a worthwhile film. For starters, his half-hearted attempt to connect 1968 to the present is both incomplete and misdirected (including John Stewart in a documentary about 1968?!). Secondly, he repeatedly mentions the so-called ""silent majority"" of conservative upset with the turmoil, yet fails to give them a voice. Pat Buchanon is one of the few conservatives featured. Lastly, I was also distracted by the inclusion of some his own personal memories, particularly the story about his friend that was killed in Vietnam. I would be interested to hear the story from the perspective of the veteran's family."
2,fake 60s music,"You cannot separate this year from the incredible rock music that helped define it, yet what you get in this so-so documentary is fake 60's music that is meant to sound like it comes from 1968. I don't know why actual songs from 1968 weren't used - the History Channel didn't feel like paying for the rights? - but for me it really hurt the production. I kept getting distracted and annoyed by the imitation rock music. It was particularly aggravating during the part of the documentary that was specifically about the bands that were making waves at the time!"
2,Sad...,"I recall the wonderful days of trance 97-99 and the exquisite job Oakenfold did for the scene in general. As soon as the ""above-underground"" MTV generation got a hold of him, it was over. I remember when the end when I saw on TV a exclusive live mix CD, ""available on TV only!"". Bunkka was horrid and this CD in my opinion is too. It is sad that true artists have to blend mainstream genres in with their sound in order to get more followers. The last thing I want to hear when I go to a club is a Justin Timberlake or Madonna track. If your a MTV loyal and have MTV Dance Party 1-277, then this is your CD."
1,NO,"I dont think so Oaky, go back to GU Oslo, NY or tranceport if you want to hear Paul at his finest. I mean jesus, justin timberlake?!?! No."
2,DJ wants to come above ground...,"Once there was a challenging underground DJ who brought us through strange and vibrant Jurneys!. Now there is a PR hungry industry player who churns out medicore sets laiden with actual pop music (that lamo from the backstreet boyz or bufu boys, or whatevever that coporate uncool thing is) Stick to Paul Van Dyk, Danny Taneglia, Deep Dish, Junior Vasquez for challenging Underground, Sexy, Trance, and Tribal. This on is for industry players only!"
2,Oakenfold's downfall....,"Let me start by saying that I am not 12, I just don't feel like making an Amazon.com account. Now to the review...It seems like ever since Oakefold tried to go mainstream, the quality of his music has been going down and down... He went from being a great trance mixer to some sellout guy who mixes stupid pop songs by fake artists like Justin Timberlake. Great Wall is not much a trance album at all, but it is simply a collection of dull remixes that he combined in an attempt to make a progressive trance album. Trust me, this is not trance, but normal techno / dance needs to be removed from shelves immediately. If you want some good trance, look at Armin Van Buuren, Tiesto, or Oakenfold's vintage masterpiece called Tranceport."
2,perfecto presents: nothing perfect,"Paul Oakenfold is a pioneer in the world of trance music. There is no argument here. But he is not - that is NOT - the world's number one DJ. It is something I am tired of hearing. In fact, if I were to list my favourite 30 DJ's, Oakenfold's name would not be listed.True, Oakenfold has at times been Mr. Perfecto when it comes to producing, remixing, and, surprisingly, selling himself as the world's best DJ. But there have been too many crap Oakey shows that I've seen in the past few years to recommend anything from him. If you want to pursue a few real class acts, check out mixes by Sander Kleinenberg and Dave Seaman."
3,good album not his best,"Nice album, I do like to listen to it but it doesn't have the pump up as his earlier mix CDs, especially his essentials house mix cd with all the remixed pop songs that are energetic and very danceable.still this is a good two CD album"
5,"This is an album for lovers, trance lovers that is.","This record, as mixed by Paul Oakenfold, is not just worth buying because of the Oakenfold/Perfecto name, but the track selection that is has on it! While I will agree that Oaky has great mixing skill, without the tracks that he so carefully selected, this would just be another mix CD that would be a drop in the comprehensive ocean of trance. Just to name a few wonderful tracks from this record: Motorcycle - As the Rush Comes (In my opinion the best trance track in 2003), Jon B - Mercury Skies (I was amazed at the mix he put on the CD), his Madonna remix (I play this a lot, surprisingly)...Just the whole package of mixing and tracks is enough even to please even the occasional trance listener."
2,Look somewhere else,"OK, anyone who thought this was a good CD just because of the mixing is an idiot. Think about what computers can do now, have you ever heard him mix a ""live"" CD? That's because live mixes you find of him on tour and in clubs suck, why? because he can't mix if a computer isn't doing it. And also, Requiem For a Dream by Leama is an old old song, shouldn't be on this CD. And ever since Bunkka he's sold out and is trying to make electronica mainstream by using big time pop culture names like Justin Timberlake and Madonna. If you seriously want a good mixed CD, look somewhere else, like Ferry Corsten, John Digweed or Sasha, Christopher Lawrence, Seb Fontaine, D:Fuse, the list goes on and on. If you want a progressive or trance CD from Oakenfold, look back to his older stuff, which everyone always mentions."
4,Goin Back...,"It's nice to hear Oakenfold go back to the Global Underground days. It's not often that you can play a cd at work, not upset the ""older"" customers and yet not fall asleep. Definitely a jump up from Bunkka. :)"
2,On to the next one...,"Simply not up to par with Oakie's previous masterpieces. Any one of his Radio One Essential Mixes is far superior than this. Unfortunately, you have to wait and see what he'll come up with next."
4,HE'S BACK,"I hated Bunkka, but this is one of best he's done in a long time. I frequently listen to Transport and Another World as well as Live in Oslo and now i have to add this to the collection of great music."
5,As progressive as trance gets,"What an amazing compilation of trance(?) My first impression would be to call it trance because the mixes are so beautiful. But there is so much depth here that it really falls into something much more progressive. This music will grow on you and before you know it, 3 months will pass and you'll still be discovering another great track. You'll find big sound, crisp rythms, celestial melodies, and dark mind-bending bass."
5,Masterpiece,"I have purchased every album that I have come accross from this artist(a total of 23 discs). I have loved every minute of his music but if all of his albums were played end to end this album would be the great crescendo. I had never reviewed him, but after owning this album for 3 hours, I decided that I'm due. It is a shame that most mainstream music is oriented toward 14 year old audiences while geniuses of this caliber can go almost unnoticed by the general public. He is truly a modern day master."
5,Hot Stuff,"One point of information I'd like to reveal aboutthis fantastic box set of the great Coleman Hawkins.Of ten CDs, the first five have vocals; the secondfive do not have vocals. This is important if youlike your jazz vocal-free. I like to take thefive vocal-free CDs and put them in my CD player on""random play"" and then I'm set----hours and hoursof GENIUS without interruptive vocals. It don'tget no better than this."
2,Books were old and tattered.,"From the picture, I expected nicer, newer books but received old, tattered books and paid way too much for them all things considered. I was very disappointed since I had bought them as a gift for someone."
3,"For Silja, this coms too late","This should have been a marvellous recording, but while Silja makes up, on stage, for vocal shortcomings through sheer presence, obviously that presence is absent on disc, and the voice is left to its own devices. For that, it's now too late. Ten years ago, perhaps, but with all due respect to this outstanding artist, not today. A great shame."
4,Good But Expensive,"I've always liked The Doors since their first album in 1967. I also like the way Rhino Handmade Records put out these live recordings. The sound quality is top notch and the idea of a complete show (no edits) is unique. The show in Philadelphia has some wonderful performances, Mystery Train, Ship Of Fools , and Universal Mind just to name a few. I docked a star because I found the performance of the band tired somewhat two thirds into the show.Maggie Magill and the blues tunes seem to lose steam for me. I found myself playing the first disc more. Just as a side note, I know this CD is OOP but I don't think the contents of the music is worth the price people and vendors are asking for it.Yes I paid top dollar only because it completed my collection, but of all the titles that were released, this would not be my first choice."
4,When The Music's Over you still have a great show to enjoy,"As the author of the Jefferson Airplane book ""Take Me To A Circus Tent"" it has always impressed me the energy and the mystery a Doors live gig held.The Philadelphia show is a great journey to the past. The Doors never got the credit for the musicianship they showed both in the live environments and in studio. This performance will give you a taste of what I mean.Whenever you could get them doing a version of ""Carol"" you'll never go wrong.It has been often said when a fan leaves a Doors show they are as tired as those on stage. It will be no different here. Get plenty of rest and listen up the celebration is about to begin!Be well always,Craig FentonAuthor of the Jefferson Airplane book ""Take Me To A Circus Tent"""
2,Something Different,"By design, this is a relatively short, disjointed production of scenes that seem to be from the cutting room floor but ultimately weave into an engaging story deep on characters, while shallow on quality. I was left with the impression that the actors and director met over drinks and sketched an outline and then improv'ed while the camera rolled. Not a bad thing when the cast spared no skin (yes, there are ""frontals"") and acted with gusto no matter the quality of dialog. Check all of the DVD features to see additional footage (and skin...) and share this viewing with your significant other or classmate from your film studies class."
2,Deleted Scenes is not the best work,"I have it and watched this movie my guess is I will not watch it again, nothing remarkable here, average at best."
5,Great Gummies!!,"Great flavor, not to firm not to soft, high quality gummies. If you are a person who is picky about what kind of candy you like to enjoy like i am. These little jewels of chewy, fruity, awesomeness are for you! With the zip-lock bag so you can take a handful or two at a time it allows you to eat them at your own pace, i expect to have these for my own personal stash for quite awhile."
3,They're okay,"You can buy these 5-lb bags for five dollars from Sams Club. They are not my favorite gummy bears, but for the price, I can never pass these up. The gummy bears are not very soft, but the flavor is good. I prefer Market Pantry brand gummy bears from Target. They are very soft and flavorful."
1,horrible,"I still haven't received my products, I'm highly upset. Dont recommend until I recieve my order. I want my order, it was estimated to arrive atleast by Jan. 17th"
2,flat and lack flavor,The candy in the white page was GREAT. They were plump and juicy gummy bears. Now my store has switched to a green bag version. These gummy bears are flat and lack any flavor. I would not recommend this version to anyone.
2,Were not fresh on arrival.,Became very hard and dry quickly. Not as many flavors and not as tasty as the Albanese Gummies. Not as good a value either. My opinion - check out the Albanese for a better treat!
2,gummi bears,there is no comparison between this brand and haribo. haribo surpasses black forest by an infinite amount. i cant even believe people would compare the two!!!!
2,"The Gummi Bear flavors get 5 stars, but....",The top third of the bag had been smashed in and all of those steam-rolled gummi bears became gummi fruit roll-ups. Not what I ordered.
5,The Best Gummy Bears,"Full of flavor and so big that it got me through a rough set of finals, this is highly recommended for the next finals season. I got the idea from work where we all shared a big bag like this. No one could stop at just a scoopful."
5,moral booster,Black Forest Gummy products are always fresh with the real taste of fruit that is pleasent to the taste buds.
1,Very disappointed in product storage,"I have eaten Dark Chocolate Toblerone before. It is one of my favorites. However, this chocolate was stale and had been frozen at some time - it had a whitish exterior to the bars. Not just one bar, but all of them. Amazon needs to take more care in selecting their supplier."
4,Dependable Candy,"This is indeed ""dark"" chocolate and not ""bittersweet"" as the label on the Toblerone package indicates; so it is rather sweet, but unlike USA produced products still tastes like that apparently elusive substance known as chocolate. The honey almond nougat is unfortunately mostly lost amidst the chocolateness, but it gives the bar a nice crunch when it is hastily chewed, or a slight stickiness when the bar is slowly savored. In short you can make a meal out of--a portion--of this bar. It's not some vile brown sugary confection, nor is it a gourmet experience; it's simply a satisfyingly rich chocolate bar."
5,great dark chocolat,"An outstanding Swiss dark chocolate, at a very good price, from an excellent vendor. Thanks!!!"
4,Overpowering,"The reason why I love Toblerones is the honey toffee chips. Unfortunately, the dark chocolate overpowers the honey flavor. The chocolate in itself is not bad. It's probably about in the middle in terms of quality. It's not particularly smooth, but it's better than Hersheys by a longshot. Just try to avoid chewing this treat up so you can still enjoy the honey toffee and almond flavor at the end."
1,NOT USEFUL,"Don't buy this product! Though it looks like a perfect vacuum for small places, like cleaning the car, it performs terribly. The suction is just fine...but the accessory brushes and hoses are terrible! They come off every minute while your trying to clean. So you constantly have to be stopping to reconnect the hoses and brushes. They need to create some sort of lock connection because these are not sturdy at all."
1,Don't bother,"This only worked well for a few months then it was awful. We replaced the filter which was REALLY hard to find and more expensive than the unit itself. Even after that, it just never worked that well again. I wouldn't take it even if they were giving it away for free! What a rip-off."
1,"Quite a Disappointment, Sweetie","As with any cultish thing, you've got your psycho fans and your fans. Psycho fans will like whatever you do no matter what, and AbFab has got some rabid, psycho fans. Now, based on the original series and the ""Last Shout"" movie, I can see why so many people flipped for the whole she-bang. I loved those original shows myself, and they are worth buying because they are funny--inspired, tuned-in to the zeitgeist, scabrous, etc etc etc . . . all things that series 4 is not. I couldn't wait to see the new shows once they went to air. Then they aired--I could feel myself desperate to laugh, but nothing. Not one single laugh. In fact, I felt embarrassed watching it all. What on earth happened? Series 4 is forced, utterly lacking in timing, mean without insight, and completely joyless. As much as I hate to say it, series 4 of AbFab stinks."
3,Unfortunate,"Let's face it: The first two seasons were absolutely brilliant. The third was very close to the same. But the fourth....do you remember when the B-52's released ""Good Stuff"" and it sounded like a new group trying to act and sing like the old? The same applies here. The proverbial iron is cold.(But I bought it anyway)And, like everyone else, I look forward to ""The Last Shout"" being released on DVD. It couldn't be more appropriately titled."
5,Took me a while to warm up to.....,"It's still hilarious, and the tons of extras make the DVD set a must to buy. But it took me a while to warm up to. Perhaps it was the anticipation. Comedy Central teased me for too long with the promise of new episodes and then - they weren't as cool as they were. That was the beauty of Patsy and Edwina, no matter what happened or how pathetic and silly they were, they always came out ahead, they were always cool. But in season 4 things didn't quite go that way. My world view was shattered - I mean, Patsy can always get a man - can't she? But I sure warmed up to it and I have found that I can watch this season over as many times as I can the first three (which never ever get old), because Patsy and Eddi may be more pathetic, Gran more crazy, and Saffy more uptight, but they are still so very funny.Did I mention how cool the extras are too?"
3,Ab-Fab but lacks the spark of first 2 seasons,"Ab-Fab`s british humour is fantastic as always, but lacks timing of the great first two series! If you are a fan of Ab-Fab is still worth having it!"
5,Good Fast Service,I received my purchases very quickly after placing my order and it was in perfect condition.
5,Always a 5,"What can I say? AB-FABS are, and always will be my favorites. This DVD was the last in the series I have in VHF. My hope, is that they will come up with another series."
4,funny,"great performance between the actors, a few of the story lines look and sound repatative. Overall great show."
5,Surprise - the shows are in 16x9 anamorphic format!,"Yes, you read right, all of the new episodes on this set, and the Mirrorball special are presented in 16x9 widescreen anamorphic format. (The shows were originally shot in high definition.)What a treat to find this out when the disc was popped in - all widescreen TV owners will enjoy filling up their screens."
3,Disappointed,"I wanted to see the old gang all together again. When I heard about this season I ordered it ASAP. However it wasn't up to the same standards as the first season. The characters are all the same, yet not as good as the first time. Perhaps the only worthwhile episode was the one called ""Paris"". This episode reminded me of the original series more than the other 5 episodes.If you want to see the gang again get it. If you want to laugh and smile like the first time, you will be disappointed."
1,Foggy Mirror,"Within less than 1 week, the mirror fogged up. I followed the cleaning instructions that accompanied the mirror, but to my dismay, nothing worked. Please, do not buy this product."
1,Definitely a waste of money,"I bought this wanting to see my son in a rear-facing carseat. First, I couldn't properly secure it with either the latch or velcro. Since we have a jeep grand cherokee and he was in the middle of the backseat there was no place to attach it. I finally managed to rig something up though but after just a short time the mirror surface was fogging and unclear. I certainly couldn't see him in the tiny rearview mirror attachment."
1,I CAN'T SEE MY BABY!,"I thought this would be the perfect mirror. But after just a few uses, it started fogging up, then I realized that it was not cleanable because IT'S PLASTIC! I have not been able to use it after spending $14.00! It's not worth it, and I wouldn't recommend any mom use it. I'm better off just pulling over to view my baby from time to time."
2,BEWARE,"We had something similar to this in our car. I LOVED it! So easy to see the baby when she was rear facing HOWEVER, when we went to get our carseat checked at the local Fire Dept they said these mirrors (not just this one)but the concept are potentially deadly in a car accident. They become easily dislodged and can seriously harm your child. Just something to think about before purchasing this. While convenient, safety is compromised."
1,worst mirror ever.,"Easy installation is all I can good about it. The day I got it I installed accidentally getting fingerprints on it. I looked at the package to see how to clean it. It said use a soft cloth. I did and it made so many tiny scratches I can't see anything with, but blur. With an infant you want to see your baby clearly. I emailed the company. Hopefully they will send a different one and I don't have the same problem."
3,Bad batch of foggy mirrors -- but it can be remedied!,"Even after reading the negative reviews here of mirrors that fogged up and were uncleanable, I decided to order one and try my luck. Sure enough, as soon as I opened the package I discovered a mirror that was so cloudy I couldn't even see my reflection.I called the manufacturer (Blue Ridge International Products in Freeport, FL) and they told me there was a bad batch of mirrors produced, but they've found and fixed the problem and they'd be happy to send me a replacement at no charge.They took my name, address, and phone number and said I should have it within 7-10 days. If you run into the same problem, I encourage you to call the company and request a replacement -- be proactive!3 stars = terrible product initially received which was an inconvenience, but manufacturer's customer service was cheerful, prompt, and obliging."
3,"Good, but shifts","This is the best mirror I've found to use in a Chevy Tahoe with a rear facing baby seat. The problem I have is that it shifts EVERY time I drive. This is because it has to go on the headrest of the rear seat and show me the baby in the middle seat. What happens is I adjust it show me a clear view of the baby when we start the trip and again when we get to our destination I adjust it again because it always shifts back toward the front.In spite of its flaw, it works better than any other mirrors I""ve been able to find and, when properly positioned, it gives a nice wide view."
5,GREAT mirror,"I just love this mirror. I purchased two of them. They are much larger than most mirrors and they attach to the headrest. No suction or tape to worry about. I am able to see my boys very easily.The only problem I have is that there is fog in actually both of my mirrors. I can still see my boys perfectly fine, but the quality could be improved a little. Also be careful when cleaning, they scratch very easily.As far reading other reviews regarding the safety hazard, WOW, I never actually thought about it."
4,"Love it, but hold on to your receipt",Found it easy to install and worked great to be able to see our little one from the rear view mirror. But... the first one we had fogged up after a few days. There was a film on it that would not clean off and did not clear. Exchanged it for a new one and this one has been fine for several weeks.
1,Poor item,"We registered for and received this mirror, thinking how great it would be to see our baby while driving. We have a 4-door sedan (Kia Optima), and no matter what we tried we could not get the mirror installed to work. My husband even tried holding it at different angles, but it didn't allow me to see the baby at all. I definitely don't recommend this item."
3,Needs improvement,This item is ok. I don't like how it sticks up in the back window. If you have a small car this is an issue. I had to buy velcrow from Wal-Mart and stick it to my back seat in order for this product to be useful.
1,Don't Buy!,"here is the deal.. it sounds great, does it. BUT...First, it is set up to be on a head rest so that mom can look at her baby.. most head rests are near the door.. the safest place for your baby is to be is in the middle of the car. We had a hard time situating it so that I could see the baby at all times since we have her carseat set up in the middle of the back seat. So, since we had to rig it funny to see our baby, it did not work properly. It continued to fall and after two or three times, I gave up. I do not use it now.. and since my baby usually sleeps in the car, it isn't realy needed.Save your money and buy something else."
1,Not worth the money,The first three months it worked ok. The image in the mirror is not that sharp. Our summer is very hot (over 100 degrees) and the strap cracked after being under the sun for one Summer. I was going to throw it away because I cannot mount it in the back seat anymore. Then I figured out a way to sew it and repair it. I am not happy with the quality for the price I paid. There is really no need for a baby mirror. Just make sure that the baby is secured in the car seat.
2,Dissappointed in material,"I have a 5 1/2 month old son and we bought the rear facing mirror for my 03 Honda Accord which was great. I went to adjust the mirror today and the nylon strap fell apart in my hands, I guess from the heat or it was old to begin with. I really depend on this mirror since my son is still rear facing so it is very dissppointing to have purchased this item and now I cannot use it. Not sure what I will do, but I have definitely sent an email to the manufacturer. Just thought I would share my personal experience with all of you. Other than that is has been wonderful..... :("
2,Not designed for long-term use,"I agree with many of the other reviews here. Although this mirror has a great viewing size, once you touch the mirror, you might as well throw it away. After trying to clean a few finger prints off, the entire mirror was destroyed. It scratches and smudges so bad you can't see a thing. Useless!"
3,Could have been better,This mirror does come in handy however; the mirror is a bit foggy and looks scratched.
3,"Not bad, but not great either","This mirror is ok compared to other ones I've bought or seen. The size is good, but it's not very clear."
1,Far from safe!,Safety mirror....I don't think so! My family was in a wreck yesterday due to a deer running into the side of our car. The impact of the airbag broke the SafeFit mirror and actually sent a piece of mirror flying toward my son. Thankfully my 7 month old son and the rest of my family was okay! This company will definitely be hearing from this mama!
1,Two broken within 6 months!,"My first Safefit mirror cracked within 2 months. Thinking this must be a fluke, I purchased another one only to find it cracked a couple of months later. This is not only a waste of money, but also a safety hazard!"
1,No baby view- just 'fog',"On our first outing I looked in the rear view mirror to check on my 2-day old baby only to find that the mirror was completely 'fogged' over and I couldn't see a thing. The 'fog' doesn't come off, so we now have to return this mirror. It also shifted around a lot on the center headrest, though I obviously have no idea if this would have made it hard to see the baby. I recommend finding something else."
3,"Scratched it, so be careful","This mirror was fine, and it matched my upholstery and was cheap. I had enough toys for my daughter that I didn't think she needed an exciting mirror, plus this one was wide so I could see her really well. The only problem I had was that I used a dry napkin from a fast-food restaurant to wipe a smudge off of it one day, and I made horrible scratches on it that made it impossible to use. So, just be careful and use window cleaner or water on a soft cloth. I don't think I'll be using those dry napkins to wipe my daughter's face off either! I want her to have some skin left!"
2,Not the best for my Honda Accord,"This mirror does not work well in my Honda Accord. I think that it would work better in a vehicle with head rests in the back seat (which my car does not have). My husband and I have tried installing it several ways and it never seemed to work. Also, I had to return the first one because the adhesive melted under the velcro which made it impossible to use. The smaller mirror worked better in my car."
4,I love it but...,"I love this mirror but ... as someone already stated, the sticky part (one side of the velcro) doesn't stay stuck in the sun. I don't have headrests so I am using the tether system. I have the car seat in the center of my car and the car must get too much sun because the ""glue"" gets unsticky and loosens. That is not good when you are driving and it comes updone. It keeps falling on the baby.I could rig it by sewing the sticky side with the velrco down ... but it is too thick to get a needle through. My cousin has the same mirror, in the other pattern though, and she LOVES the mirror. She has head rests though.I recommend this mirror but be prepared for another method if you don't have headrests and you will using this in the summer."
1,Hazy Mirror,I bought this mirror before my daughter was born mainly because it was plain and very large. I set it up along with her carseat and everything was great. By the time we took my daughter home from the hospital it was already hazy looking and we could only see her if one of us turned around to look in the mirror. Which kinda defeats the whole purpose! I took it out the other day thinking it was just needing to be cleaned and it got worse. The mirror is full of scratches and the whole thing is hazy! I am now in the market for a new mirror and now that my daughter is 2 months I really want one that does something to entertain her back there!
3,not very pleased with this mirror,We have our son in the middle of the back seat which does not have a headrest over it. We placed the mirror on a headrest to the right of the carseat base and it's very difficult to see the baby this way. It's also only been in the car for 2 weeks and somehow it's all scratched up already. We have the fisher price mirror in our other car and we're much happier with that one.
2,"Nice Idea, but...","I liked the idea of being able to see my daughter in the mirror and her being able to see herself. However, when I went to take the mirror out of my car to put into my husband's car, the strap snapped off completely. Apparently the strap doesn't do well in the heat of the summer and it just dried out completely. It could have flown off into her face had I ever needed to stop suddenly.Very disappointing. I don't know if it's worth searching for a different brand."
1,"Fogged up immediately, rendering it useless","This seemed like a fabulous product but it almost instantly fogged over and became useless. The mirror was easy to install over the rear headrest of my 2001 Jetta and provided great visibility of the entire rear-facing car seat for 1 day. The next morning, I came out to my car to find the mirror completely fogged. No cleaner could remove the fog -- it's not a surface coating, it's something defective in the glass. Some other reviewers seemed to have had the same problem, others didn't -- wish I knew what I could do to prevent or remove the fog from the mirror!"
4,"Great mirror - easy to use, handy to have","I bought this mirror with my oldest son, and it was very handy to have while he was rear-facing. While the mirror does scratch easily, it offers a nice wide view so you can see the baby while quickly glancing in your rear view mirror.I also had it checked by the police when I had the car seat installed, and they didn't have any concerns about it detaching or injuring the baby. In an accident, ANYTHING can become detached or a flying object in the car (groceries, stroller, toys) but this offers no greater risk than anything else you keep in the car. And being able to quickly glance and see that the baby is ok is IMO much safer than trying to pull over on a busy highway.I would highly recommend this mirror - it has lasted more than 2 yrs for us and is very reassuring."
1,Foggy too!,"I, like other reviewers, liked this mirror at first... then it fogged over and I haven't been able to get the fog to disappear! I guess I will have to take the other reviewer's advice and contact the company for a new one!"
1,Don't bother!,"My parents bought this for me shortly after my baby was born. I drive a Toyota Corolla and for the life of me, I could not get this mirror to work. There was just no way to attach this thing to the back seat so I could see my baby. I managed to 'gerry-rig' it with some tape and it worked for about 10 minutes until I turned a corner, then it moved and I couldn't see anymore. During those few minutes that I could see my baby, though, I was so distracted I didn't pay enough attention to the road.Furthermore, I have read that it's unsafe to use a mirror like this since it can be be projected into the baby's face in the event of an accident."
1,Don't Buy!,AFTER JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS THIS MIRROR FOGGED UP. I CAN NO LONGER SEE WELL THROUGH IT.I EVEN TRIED TO CLEAN AND IT DIDN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE. WHAT A WASTE.
1,Junk!,"We have only been using this mirror for 4 months and it is so cloudy that I can no longer tell if my daughter's eyes are closed or open (and that is pretty bad!)! I think I paid $12 for it... while not a fortune, I would expect a mirror to last at least a year. Afterall - it's just sitting there - it's not even getting touched. Buy a different model!"
2,Never used it.,"I purchased this item after seeing it in a vehicle in the parking lot. I thought what a great idea. Once it came time to install it, I just couldn't. I was thinking how much of a distraction this product would be. I purchased this for the safety of our daughter, but then realized that it could do more harm than good. We all know wrecks can happen in a matter of seconds and I think this could possibly be a traffic accident waiting to happen. The product idea is good, however I personally feel a safety risk."
4,great help!,I like this product. I like being able to see my newborn's face to check and make sure she is ok while I am driving. It is a great help!
1,NOT for SUVs,"This mirror was terrible for our SUV. It didn't fit well on the headrest, which we had to extend out to even attempt to view the carseat. We drive a Pathfinder, so I hope this helps anyone considering this for their SUV. I think the package should at least give fair warning. The instructions on how to attach it are located behind the mirror, so you have to buy it and detach it before you realize how it goes on. Boo."
1,HORRIBLE! SCRATCHED INSTANTLY!,"This mirror is CRAP. When installing the mirror I got some finger prints on the mirror portion. When I tried to clean the mirror with a cloth (WITH NOTHING ON IT) half of the mirror SCRATCHED. It looks horrible. I can't see my child in the mirror at all now.I wouldnt recommend this product to ANYONE. If you do buy it, don't remove the protective film!!!! I could see my baby better with that on it than the scratches.POOR POOR POOR design."
2,Frustrated Mom from Ohio,"Does not work at all in a Honda Accord or any backseat that does not have headrests. They should clearly state that on the packaging. On the package that we received, the instructions weren't very clear as well. I would not recommend this product."
3,Peace of mind,"This concept is awesome and would get five stars if it worked the way it should. It gives great peace of mind to be able to check your baby while you drive. As the other reviews state, the mirror does has a tendency to fog up. Mine did in one corner within the first week. If it gets any worse, I will have to contact the company."
4,"Great, Large View","I bought this mirror because it has a larger mirror area than other ones. Sure, it doesn't have the colorful and fun designs, but to my daughter just seeing her reflexion is entertainment enough. It installed easily and adjusts easily. However, it does come loose occasionally, which is the only reason I don't give it 5 stars. It is so soft and lightweight that times it has come loose and landed on my daughter she isn't fazed, and she just starts playing with it. I am very happy with our decision to buy this mirror."
4,"Oh, come on, it wasn't that bad!","I really think Booklist's review is much more accurate than the one-star ratings given by the first two Amazon reviewers. All of Fforde's books are light and breezy. If that's what you're in the mood for, this book is just fine. Maybe one has to be of ""a certain age"" to appreciate it. The main character can no longer be labeled a young person, yet has never gotten around to having kids of her own. (None that I can remember!) I really enjoyed reading about her interactions with the young folk in her boarding house. However, she isn't old either, and doesn't quite fit in with the seniors on the tour France. This makes for more amusing interactions. I will still be on the lookout for Fforde's new books in future."
3,Pleasant but not outstanding,"Basically I agree with all of the other reviews here -- this is a charming, pleasant read, but not Fforde's best (which would have to be Second Thyme Around). What I would like to know is, did anyone catch the line about which Booklist said, ""[people may be put off by ]British colloquialisms, including one that could be viewed as so ""politically incorrect"" as to be offensive."" It slipped by me!"
3,Not the best Ms. Fforde has written,"Artistic License was not my favorite Fforde novel, but I didn't dislike it either. I enjoyed all the eclectic characters, especially Thea, and her relationship with small Toby was sweet. Into the mix of ""characters"" was Lara and her litter of puppies, and I found them to be charming.One thing I notice about Ms. Fforde's novels is that the protagonist and the main male character, who she inevitably falls for, often seem to be at odds at first, and argue and fuss at each other a lot before they realize they are in love. While the banter can be enjoyable, I think that this device has seen its day in Ms. Fforde's novels.I also found the Ben character a little more one-dimensional than I'm used to with Katie Fforde's books. Regardless, I do not regret reading this one and will always look forward to my next Katie Fforde book."
5,New Members,This book is an invaluable tool for new members in the Episcopal church. Well written and easy to understand. Highly recommend.
4,Tokyo Xtreme Racer 3,Great game!! much better than Zero because there are more places to race and more cars to race... the graphics are pretty much the same but a little bit better.. game play its fun... the only thing that i didn't like was the traffic.. they is only one kind of car other than the racers and they are official cars.. come on.. they could have done somethign better.. but i guess for 20 buxs.. heck of a deal and heck of a game!!!
3,this was a gift for someone else not me,my cousin really like the game he has play the whole day when i give it to himi have not play the game so i don't know how it is
3,Ok game.,"Never really played it but never really complained either. Popped the disc in, worked liked a charm but just didn't play it long enough to give an honest review."
3,It's an OK game.,"The game is good for the money. And it is an absolute copy of Fast & Furious games.The customization is a big wow. The graphics are great. The location of racing is boring after 2 hours of play. You only drive on the freeway. Didn't have to much fun since the price for customization features weren't worth it and you need to do alot of races and missions to get that money to get mods for your car.As an alternative, I recommend getting Midnight Club 3: Dub Edition. You can't go wrong with Midnight Club. If you don't like Midnight Club, then you are not a true racing fan.Bottom Line: Get the game cheap. Don't pay over 15 bucks for this one."
4,Definatly Better,"This game does everything the first one does and more. If you don't have enough money for the Need For Speed Underground, then go with this one. You wont be disappointed. Especially if you liked the first one and Zero."
1,I've found better,"This is a pretty nice blanket, but after a few washings it really thinned out in the middle and started getting holes. I stopped putting it in the dryer after a couple times because it lost so much ""fuzz."" (even on low heat). I also think it feels a little too ""acrylic-y.""I have 2, and both performed about the same. I much-much-much prefer and LOVE the Amy Coe chenille blankets from Target. they may be a little more $$, but it's worth it!"
1,WARNING! THESE ARE MASTERED FROM VINYL!,"Any of the Starpoint CDS released on the PTG or VINYL MASTERPIECE label are indeed mastered from vinyl. They are not the real thing!Another one to avoid is their phoney reissue by ATLANTIC STARR ""Radiant"".Wait for the Wounded Bird reissues that ARE the real taken from legit master tapes."
5,Helped me with microbiology class.,"I liked this book because it showed the kinds of diseases and conditions bacteria, viruses, and parasites could cause. This served me well for my college microbiology classes. The material is fun to learn. After reading this book, I know longer look at eating sushi the same way again! This is because if a sushi chef is not certified, sushi can be served with parasites in them. For test preparation, I used Microbiology Study Guide: Key Review Questions and Answers isbn;0971999635.This study guide really helped me to prepare for the type of questions that were given to me on the test. I give both books five stars."
2,Not worth the expense....,We got this for our little boy when he was 10 months old and he never really took to it until he was 2 1/2 and even now he really only uses it maybe 2 minutes/day some days...so really not worth the price. It would help if it made some sounds like the newer models...but still not worth the price!
3,Poorly Made Toy,"We bought this horse for my daughters first birthday. I bought it because of the brand name and the safety seat. Although it is a cute toy and my daughter enjoys it, the bars holding the horse together do not lock in. As she is bouncing the bars slowly come apart. AS I was pushing them together they fell apart and my daughter fell, luckily I was right there to grab her. I'm returning it to the store today!!!"
4,Good toy....,"I purchased this for my daughter's first birthday hoping she would love it. Well, she likes it a little bit...lol. She is not old enough to use the pony without the seat attached, and the seat's cut out holes are a little to small to comfortably fit her chubby thighs. So we took the seat off and are waiting for her to be able to ride without the seat.The assmebly on this pony was difficult but I think it would have been easier if I had help doing it, (I attemped to do it all by myself).My daughter loved her Jumperoo, so I think once she learns to use this pony without the seat, she will love it."
2,She hated it!,"I'm not saying this is a bad toy. I purchased it for my 10 month old daughter who loves to bounce up and down on my bed. Well, she cried every time I tried to put her on the pony, and once she was on, she just sat there then started crying. I wish she liked it as much as the other reviewer's child did. I really thought this was going to be a big hit.Also, it was very difficult to put together. I had to hammer a part in that was supposed to just ""snap"" together. Maybe it was just my model. I don't know. I took the pony back to toys r us."
5,What a WINNER of a toy!!!,"Santa brought this to my 9 mth old and she LOVES IT! Presently, I have to help her bounce or rock, but she is starting to get the hang of making it bounce on her own! It was easy to assemble, and the the horse is just darling! She loves to play with the soft ears. I can put her in this seat while I fold clothes or whatever... she CANNOT fall out or off! I see this being a favorite for a long time to come!!!"
5,Best rocking horse for 1 year olds and up.,"My son loves his rocking horse. We got the toy for him as a Christmas gift and he rides it at least once a day.My son is now almost 15 months old so I removed the wasteharness, as he showed interest in getting on and off himself.It also works as a great replacement for a swing, since babies outgrow those so quickly. Several times he has rocked himself to sleep on his horse.Very durable and safe, easy to assemble."
1,"Lots of details, no coherence","This book crams many, many details about NLP, but lacks the necessary coherence to understand and apply NLP as a consistent model. As such, it does not measure up to what is normally expected in the ""teach yourself"" series.The book ""Introducing NLP"", by Joseph O'Connor & John Seymour, though more dated, serves as a better and more useful introduction to NLP."
1,Cult or science? Targets - beware!,"This and other books on NLP encourage the reader to adopt unproven mind-altering techniques intended to make the user more charismatic. Please note how many of these snake oil peddlers are also writing books and selling other material online outlining how to seduce women through exploitation, manipulation, and lying. Their message may appeal to immature boys and insecure men, including sex addicts, but they are also putting the rest of us in the position of ""target"" (to use their language). NLP is more ""cult"" than science."
2,This book bothered me,"This book was interesting in the way that it covered the history of the Jewish people, but I thought that it was distracting to try to figure out if Sarah was really supposed to be married to God! The ""allegory"" really wasn't one, and it didn't work for me. I also disagree with the implication that godly Jews who do not recognize Jesus as Messiah (Sarah being one of them) will be saved. I was really tired of this book by the time I finished it."
5,Must Read,"For anyone to ever understand the Covenant keeping God and the history of Israel, this is a must read book. It will help everyone understand the part Israel has in the past, present and future of our world. In story form it shows God always keeps His word."
5,If you desire to understand the Bible - especially Israel &,"prophecy this book will thrill you!It took just a bit to realize who Sarah was-what a great way to present this history.I couldn't put it down for three days-it is brilliantly written & so full of Jewish tradition I thought the writer was Jewish. You will feel the pain of God's people throughout time - you will see his hand working & his enduring love!Drama, murder, mystery, romance, war-such characters(Just like the Bible)! Share this book with your friends-what a blessing it will be!I read many books - this is one of my top 10."
5,A Beloved Story!,"I saw Kay Arthur on tv doing a series on the covenant and really enjoyed the way she explained things. She mentioned that she wrote a book called Israel, My Beloved, so I was curious.I'm glad I brought the book.The story covers a time span from Jeremiah the prophet to the not too distant future. It deals with marriage, faithfulness and infidility, slavery, idolatry, suffering, hope.At times it was quite hard to read - I never knew the history of Jewish people (outside of the bible and excluding World War II). It was if nothing else, a brilliant look into the history of a nation.But it was more than that. Kay Arthur has a wonderful way with words, taking quite complex and difficult subject matters (for example the rape of women at the hands of an invading force), and doesn't make it sordid or weak. I really enjoyed reading this book and felt a little sad when I finished the last page.This is a wonderful book. You won't regret buying it!"
1,A major disappointment,"I bought this book to read on a trip to Israel. What really bothered me was her treatment of Jesus as Messiah. She never states it, not even when He returns at the end. There was a significant opportunity to witness here, and she failed to come close. Also, she is not fair in her portrayal of Christians pertaining to the Jewish people. Yes, there was systematic persecution at the hands of supposed Christians. This is historic and undeniable. And she does portray the heroic efforts of true Christians to help during the holocaust. But no mention is made of our current era...with Christians supporting Israel in many, many, ways. So, although the book was well written and clever I can't support it."
3,goofy,"Kay Arthur is usually very sharp and insightful. Most of her books I have enjoyed. This one, not so much.I read half of it and found it boring and the premise unimaginative. Not a good book if you're looking foran accuate history of Israel. She doesn't connect the dots. However, if does help if you don't understandhow deeply and serious G-d's love for Israel is. Still, I recommend it, it's better than most of the crapin the secular book stores."
2,Not an inviting read,"I must admit that I havn't gotten around to reading this book. Not that the topic doesn't interest me; but there are just too many words and thoughts - and less feeling - in this book, at least for my taste. Love, Juri."
4,Alaska Railroad to Seward,"This is a great video for anyone who is planning a trip to Alaska and is thinking about riding on the AKRR. If you are looking to fly in a few days early before a cruise out of Seward, this tape gives some great places to visit. Spectacular footage of the railroad, glaciers and Kenai Fjords National Park."
5,CRL Lint Free Glass Wipes,"The CRL Lint Free Glass Wipes are excellent. The wipes are strong and are absolutely lint free; great for cleaning glass, mirrors, or any other reflective surface. I would recommend this product to others."
2,Limited Usability,"This USB adapter does the job, but only marginally so. It seems to require a wall plug to work. If I try using it directly with a laptop or USB charger, it does not work. Instead, I must piggy back with another device/cable having its own AC/DC power supply. I wish the seller had made that clear."
4,basic cable,"This cable saved my from having to get the music bundle for my phone. cable works as expected, although the included driver disk is a hard to use, but i just looked up my manufacturers drivers and they worked fine after windows installed some others."
2,Cable is great...,"Software on CD is garbage. You will have better luck googeling the drivers you need yourself. Otherwise, great price for the cable."
3,"Great Price, Great Charger, Does Not Transfer Data",Bought it for my wife's LG Chocolate (8550) and while I was not able to get it to synch with Windows Media Player (even after downloading bitpim)this cable is a great charger. A much cheaper alternative to buying expensive chargers. The only way we can transfer music to her phone is by using a microSD Card with a USB reader/adapter.
4,Good and Cheap,"Received quickly.At two and a half bucks, this is quite a deal. Compare to Verizon's music kit at $20. I did have a problem with the shield pulling off of the connector. I replaced it with a drop of super glue, and it's good as new."
4,It's a data cable,"Does what a data cable should do. The driver cd that came with it didn't have the vx8600, but the cable fits the chocolate and Rhapsody detects the phone and lets me sync with it, which I found quite nice since I don't have any of the Verizon or LG sync software. It would probably work with other music management software but I haven't tried."
1,Cable wouldn't stay connected,The product arrived fine and on time from AccessoryOne. But the cable would not stay connected in the USB port on my computer. I had to hold it just right for the cable to stay connected. I threw this cable away and wound up buying Verizon's Music Essentials Kit for my LG VX8600. The Music Essentials Kit provided a cable and driver that work fine.
1,-1 star Does not work,"I ordered this from Bargaincell, and it doesn't work. They did offer to replace it, but I also ordered a travel charger and car charger which came from mynetdeals. None of these cables or chargers worked with my LGEnv. I decided rather than risk messing up my brand new phone, I'll order all cables from Verizon. Cheap is only good if it works."
1,"Software a joke, cable doesn't work","The CD that comes with the cable contains only confusing html files that try to point to drivers and software to download. The cable never made a good enough connection for Windows to recognize it. It kept saying ""A USB device has malfunctioned."" However, the cable is not worth sending back. The shipping is more than the cable itself."
1,Data cable,Unfortunately this was not the proper cable for my phone. Not the sellers fault and cost of return not worth it.
1,Poor service,"After I received the cable and plugged it into my computer, I noticed it didn't charge my phone at the same time. I emailed the company to ask if there was something wrong and the response was ""it not supposed to"". That was it...no suggestions about what I could do, not even a sorry for the inconvenience. Some of the WORST customer service I've seen in a long time."
5,Great book for getting started in HTML,"If you want to learn HTML this is the book to buy. Unlike many larger books, the 10 Minute Guide to HTML cuts straight to the heart of the matter, telling you what you need to know in order to get your web pages up as soon as possible. Its packed with information presented in a clear, concise form thats easy to read and understand. The main difference between this book and many of the larger ones is that the 10 Minute Guide hasn't been padded out with the history of the Internet, HTML, and anything else the author can think of to justify an inflated price tag. Which means that this book, unlike those others, won't put you to sleep before you can find any useful information. If you want to learn basic HTML, buy this book! Its a great place to start."
1,poor quality for a lot of money,"The base makes a relatively loud NOISE when the lamp is turned on.The steel mesh shade is clumsily constructed. The base is too light. The area that the lamp lights is very small. The gooseneck section is too short, therefore the lamp is not flexible enough.I would have returned this if it cost $20 (because of the noise), but nearly $80 for such a low quality object boggles the mind."
1,Ok if your in the space shuttle below the satillite and have plenty of aluminum foil,"Item is ok if you can get it for around $50. You get very little receiver strength so you should pay very little. Almost impossible to position on a car and get it to receive. Forget about hiding it anywhere on a car. You'll need to pretty much hold it out the window. If you want to use as a hidden vehicle tracker, go elsewhere. Get one with antenna mounts."
2,Horrible Battery Life,I was not satisfied with the product because I expected longer battery life. I chose this product based on its advertised claim that the TrackStick had the ability to turnoff when not in motion. I have yet to get more than 3-days out of a set of batteries with the car parked in the driveway. It appears the device constantly looks to connect to available satellites. I would not recommend purchasing this device.
4,"Discreet, and sticks to the car! Great for many uses.","My husband and I got this to keep a tab on our son and the car we just bought him (he's had a very distrustful history). Well, our doubts were quelled. After we found out nothing weird was going on, we removed the Trackstick and now just use it for documenting our road trips. It's kind of fun to pair up the map files with our photos and see all the geography of the roads less travelled. My only complaint was that the computer program isn't as user friendly as some other things like my iPod, so my husband usually has to do all the tech-work."
1,didn't work for me,"I put batteries in and plugged into my computer like instructed. Supposedly everything was downloaded. I turned it on and put it outside so it could find location. I pplaced it where it couldn't be seen near rear windshield. Green light was blinking. When I plugged it back into computer, not only did it NOT have any information about where car had been, the computer said the device wasn't detected!!!!. Tried to contact mfr help, but didn't get any satisfaction. If I hadn't already thrown away packing slip(spouse almost saw it!....he's the reason I got it), I would have sent it back."
2,BAD BUY - don't waste your money,I haveused travel eyes 2 for years but my computer took a dump. Bought this TRACKSTICK2 as a backup 'til I could get the computer fixed. This thing is terrible - eats batteries and drops signal all the time. You can not get any idea of where an emplyee has been. Waste of money as far as I am concerned and wish I hadn't spent the $200.
1,Disney's Mahjongg (Jewel Case),"If I had had a free trial to play this game before purchasing, I would of never purchased this game. One of the most annoying factors about this game is that the pattern on many of the tiles keeps changing while you are playing the game. Such as tiles with different color fireworks keep continously going off. There is no way to turn off this feature. I am a huge Disney fan and frequently go to both Disneyland and Disney World. But as far as I am concerned this should be removed from the Disney itinerary, since this game is such a very poor representation of the Disney name.If there had been a no star to choose from, that would have been what I would have choosen. There where other things about the game that I did not like, but the most annoying was the changing patterns on the tiles."
2,Pretty dull,"This game is of little interest to my six-year old, who has other Disney software that he loves. While there is some animation in the tiles themselves, there's not much else going on. The backgrounds are basically blank, and after you've played for twenty minutes or so, you've pretty much seen all it has to offer."
3,Are you serious about finding meaningful work?,I have been slogging through this book for over a year. It is tough work and it is a deep subject. Lots of penetrating exercises. If you like the Soul's Code by Hillman this book will work for you.
5,Betty Crocker's Cookie Book,"My son got this cookie recipe book through a school book order when he was very young, maybe 1st or 2nd grade. That was in the early 1980s and I am still using it, held together with tape. Glad to see copies are still available...It's the kind of book you don't want to stop using, with such a variety of cookie recipes and plenty of ""favorites."" Color illustrations of some of the cookies are a nice accompaniment to the recipes. Especially handy during the holidays but good year-round."
4,Good beginners' guide to the Fab Four!,"If anyone out there truly /is/ a complete Beatles idiot, then this is the perfect first book to read. Filled with little tidbits and choice behind-the-scenes items, it sketches out the Fab Four's story from the skiffle days as the Quarrymen to the last Apple rooftop concert. Perhaps not as in-depth as some titles out there, and certainly written with a view through rose-colored glasses, but still and excellent intro to the magical mystery tour that is the career of the greatest rock group of all time."
3,"Good, but with some mistakes...","I was just perusing this title last night at Tower Records. I've been doing some research on the Beatles' concerts in the Philippines and I noticed that this book kept referring to the capital city as ""Manilla"" instead of the correct spelling ""Manila"". I didn't notice any places in the book where they said ""Londdon"", ""Pariss"", ""New Yorrk"" or ""Tokyyo""... maybe the editors of the book just didn't care."
2,First ingredients are salt and MSG,"Use sparingly, not only because it's very unhealthy, but because it has a very fishy taste. I used the recipe's instructed amount on the first batch of miso soup and it was way too much."
3,Great book about long ago but keep the current politics about global warming out of it.,The book is a great organized narrative about a topic that needs more consideration. I like how it flowed (when on topic) and made it easy for us non-academics to follow it.Very comprehensive as well.What particularly irritated me and destroyed the whole flow and feel of the book was constant references to the current controversy concerning global warming. He seemed to argue that just because the climate changed in the past it is now a certainty that now man is doing the global warming. This is in spite of the fact that it is clear from his book man had nothing to do with gloabal warming in the past. This lack of logic puts a cloud over the rest of his observations about long ago.Because of this badly placed distraction I have a hard time recomending what otherwise would have been a great book.You do not mix politics and science in a book like this.
1,Pointless fiction obscures science,"Just a warning - this book is based on a fictional character supposedly wandering through prehistory describing what he sees. Chapter 3 begins, ""Unable to sleep, John Lubbock sits by the lakeshore watching bats at work...""Very annoying but worse it involves imaginative descriptions of supposed prehistoric scenes with little distinction between what is known and what is fiction. Archaeologists will be enlightened to learn that the artist at Pech Merle worked in a drug induced state for many hours until exhausted. All this time a small boy held a lamp for him.Ah, the wonders of science. Exhaustion dating, who knew? What could I have learned if I had read on?Apparently some like this approach. I would think that those who want a speculatively fleshed out story would prefer the illustrated works from National Geographic, the Smithsonian and others. A lot has been done about fleshing out the appearance of our ancestors from their fossils."
2,Too long and repetitive,"I almost always finish books, but I gave up here after 3/4. It's just a string of facts tied loosely together. If it was 1/2 as long and more tightly focused I would have recommended it."
2,Well written but disappointing,"After the Ice is well written and contains lots of information; however, my enjoyment of the book was significantly reduced by the author's obvious Socialist leanings and hatred of America. Further, his unquestioning worship of the THEORY of global warming got old real fast. There is as much or more data supporting the THEORY of an upcoming ice age. In any event we can not influence the matter in any significant way - when Mother Nature speaks, we listen; not the other way 'round.Sarge Reynolds, Geologist"
4,After the Ice,"A narrative account of prehistoric human ""history"" and the archaeological studies that reveal it.As a total ignoramus in this field, I found Mithen's narrative with its imaginary observer engaging and his descriptions full of detail and apparently well-supported. I desperately needed a graphic timeline, though, to illustrate in what relation to each other the different settlements stood. And some overview discussion at various points would have brought the dizzying stream of detail better under control.Interesting (inevitably not conclusive) on issues such as the first colonization of the Americas, megafaunal disappearance and the reasons why humans began to farm and live in towns. Refreshingly free of the tendency to automatically ascribe religious significance to every artifact. Given the theme of climate change and its effect on humanity that runs through the book, Mithen's concluding comments on global warming seem apropos."
3,Impressionistic and chaotic views of prehistorical sites,"I was attracted to buy and read the book because of its subject, which sounds as a very interesting one; but I was disappointed by its treatment by the author. In each chapter, the data available on 2, 3 or more prehistorical sites are detailed, after which some more general exposition on the area, period or scholarly disputes on interpretation of evidence are provided. The outcome is that information is given in a fragmented, piecemeal fashion, without any overall explanation of evolution during this period. The book is often dry, I did not drop it because its matter is engaging. I had the same feeling with Mithen's ""The Prehistory of the Mind"", I had to make an effort to finish it."
2,confused narration,"Within two chapters I sadly realized that I would not finish this book. The John Lubbock character is a distraction and unnecessary. Inserting this fictional being sporadically into the text was extremely annoying. The hardback will go to the local library free book shelves. It is not the subject matter (anthropology was my undergraduate major), it is the style that is the problem. Whatever other stylistic issues may exist, I could not tolerate this useless, irritating intrusion."
5,"AN INTRIGUING ""HOW-TO"" OF LEADERSHIP COMMUNICATIONS","Baldoni's ""Great Communication Secrets Of Great Leaders"" is a well-researched and highly readable ""how-to"" of leadership communications. This author knows his material, and presents it through the interesting device of linking principles to some of the world's leading communicators. It was refreshing to read a business-centered book that focus specifically on the communication aspects of leadership, which Baldoni obviously understands quite well. As a former professional actor, I also enjoyed how the author links dynamic presentations to effective performance. This book is well worth the modest cover price. A definite ""buy!"""
2,"Few good cases, but lack theory","The book describes a few good and well known communicators, but the analysis of the different communicators and the communication theory behind it, is best defined as non-exsistent.If it is news to you, that you need to repeat the message and be trustworthy when you communicate, then this book will probably be the right choice. If you already knew that, I will not recommend this book. This book does not go deeper than that. Unfortunately."

5,"7 year old says...""AWESOME!!!""",We love the Knights Kingdom Bionicles and we were so glad to find them on amazon as they aren't carried in most stores anymore (I don't think they are being made anymore). My 5 year old followed the instructions and put it together with supervision and a little help from dad. He can now put it together on his own and uses it with the other bionicles to mix and match. It is up to legos great standards and we love the rolling catapult.
4,Slumberjack Bonnie & Clyde,We attempted this sleeping bag on an air mattress which may have something to do with the discomfort. It kept us very warm and there are straps at the top which keep the zippers from unzipping. It is a pain to roll back up... wish here was a bag to store it in.
4,Warm and Cozy,This sleeping bag has been the best investment we have made when it comes to our camping equipment. We used to go and set up the tent then inflate the queen mattress then put a quilt on the mattress then a fitted sheet then a flat sheet and blanket and another quilt. Now we inflate the mattress and throw the sleeping bag on top. So far it has been warm enough but we have only been out in upper 60 degree temps. The only thing that I see that could be improved upon is the way it folds up. It is still very large and when camping smaller is better.
4,"A sleazy, breezy Russ Meyer classic!","The second installment in Russ Meyer's series in Rural Dramas is one of his best: a well-shot, entertaining explitation piece which seems to get better with each viewing. An ex-prisoner find work (and sex) at a farm owned by Stewart Lancaster (who we all remember from FASTER, PUSSYCAT! KILL! KILL!) and his niece played by Antoinette Cristiani who is married to alchaholic sleazebag, Hal Hopper (LORNA). Even Russ Meyer himself has a very small part as someone in the crowd during Hal Hopper's execution at the end. Keep a lookout for this underated Russ Meyer flick because it's quite rare. Anyone reading this review from Australia can find this video at FASTER, PUSSYCAT! in NSW or at POLYESTER in VIC."
3,Heaps o' Hicks 'n' Hucks!,"Lordy, what a lark! Thar's a toothless, cacklin' crone of an ex-whore who's pimpin' her busty, bleach-blonde gals, a smarmy, low-down lout who's tryin' to pork ever' purty thang in sight, a hellfire 'n' brimstone spoutin' preacherman, upright womenfolk 'n' a farm in peril, 'n' a strangerman strivin' to straighten it all out! The actin' aint the bestest, 'n' the directin's kindly overwrought, but, lawsy, it's a hoot! ('N' the hootERS is sometimes bare 'n' bouncin'!) All in all, it's a middlin' good tale!"
3,Better Documentation Required,"The book presents very powerful ideas that could be implemented in Java. However, with a more elaborate documentation of the concepts as applicable to java programming (that in current form the book seems to be lacking) would help to make a better presentation of the ideas"
4,Mickey and Me,"Mickey and me is about a boy named Joe Stoshack that can travel through time using baseball cards. His father gets in a car accident and asks Joe to go back in time to keep Mickey Mantle from an injury that ended his career as a great player. He travels back in time with a Mickey Mantle card(or so he thinks). He does meet Mickey, but is it the right one? Read this book to find out."
1,Totally inappropriate book,"I bought this book for my 11-year-old son. Thankfully, his much older sister skimmed it first and reported to me, ""This book is disgusting."" Sure enough, it is. Totally inappropriate subject matter. Lust, nudity, dating older women. This has no place on a kids' bookshelf. I will never buy another Dan Gutman book again."
1,Review from a 10-year old baseball fan,"I recently read Mickey & Me by Dan Gutman. Out of the 6 books in this series which I have read, it was the most disappointing. Stosh never really met Mickey Mantle until the last few pages and it was the 13 year old Mickey Mantle. In all the other books, he always meets the character he's looking for earlier on in the story. Personally, I don't recommend this one."
2,NOT MUCH OF A TRIBUTE,"THE MUSIC ON THIS CD IS PRETTY FAITHFUL TO THE ORIGINAL. THE SINGING IS ANOTHER STORY. THE ONE GUY WHO SINGS SHOULD STICK TO HIS DAY JOB, CAUSE A FUTURE IN THE MUSIC BIZ HE DOES NOT HAVE. I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN THE SONG SELECTION TOO. I WOULD HAVE LIKED THEM TO INCLUDE VOODOO FROM THE FIRST CD. ALSO, DUMP I STAND ALONE AND INCLUDE STRAIGHT OUT OF LINE. I'VE SEEN GODSMACK SEVERAL TIMES, AND THEY NEVER DISAPPOINT. WISH I COULD SAY THE SAME ABOUT THIS ALBUM. I ALSO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH TRIBUTE ALBUMS FOR BANDS THAT HAVE ONLY BEEN AROUND A FEW YEARS. ANYWAY, I WOULD HAVE GIVEN A HIGHER RATING IF NOT FOR THE POOR VOCAL PERFORMANCES ON HALF THE SONGS."
5,GET IT!!,"AMAZING INSIGHT BY THIS AUTHOR! AFTER READING THIS BOOK, I WANTED TO RUSH RIGHT OUT AND BUY ONE FOR EVERYONE I KNOW!POWERFUL! A MUST FOR EVERY CHRISTIAN WOMAN!!"
5,This Guy Knows His Stuff,"Coming from the world of ASP/VBS, etc., I thoroughly searched the local generic huge book store chain, and thumbed through and finally selected 3 books to teach me PHP/mySQL.Only after I got home and read 'em in depth did I realize they were all written by the same guy, Larry Ullman:MySQL; PHP for the WWW; and PHP Advanced.All three books are great, they are easy to follow, I am getting better and better jobs because of the skills I've gleaned from these books. The author also hosts a forum for poeple who have questions about what's in the boks.Very helpful stuff, you'll benefit from it."
4,Intermediate but Very Good,"There is a lot more to PHP than Ullman covers in his 'PHP Advanced'. But what he does cover, is well done. Not too verbose. Direct and to the point. I like his explanations & examples. It makes learning and referencing a subject easier and quicker.Looking forward to 2nd edition & hoping he adds more advanced subjects."
3,"Item is good, Store not","This watch is good but the store, did not send me any note letting me know the situation, and now I receive daily junk e-mails from different names, about watch. I contcated them several times, but they keep doing their business."
4,"Music is great, packaging less so","I picked up the LOMA anthology and had to find more Linda Jones - this is a great program of tunes but the packaging is cheap, up to and including the songs being listed on the outer and inner cover out of order - not just a few slip-ups, it's like the thing is on shuffle-play. Maybe it's just my copy (and no - it's not my player), but once I got past this I was able to just concentrate on an incedible but - sadly - lost talent."
4,Great Hat,"It has to be a great hat because it has not left my son's head since he got it! He is extremely picky about hats, they have to be fitted, and soft, and ...you get the point. I finally threatened to burn his favorite hat becasue it was awful, and ordered this as a hopeful replacement...he has not missed that smelly old Texas hat one bit! Good quality and nice fit too!"
4,Not for Gigantor Heads,"I wear almost an 8... some 7 7/8 fit, most flexfit hats i can strech enough to where i can wear them without cutting off the circulation in my forehead, but this one was too small for my Monsterous head. Sharp looking hat though!!"
1,Two did not play at all,The dvd did not play past the FBI warning and would lock up. I returned it and ordered another. It did the same thing. I know three's the charm but I didn't want to take the chance. Maybe if I ask it to be tested before shipping next time I might try it again. I gave it a one star rating because the box was nice.
3,Good Holly wood escape flick,This is one of my husband's favorit films. It is a good comedy sequel to Mr. Roberts.Only thing you could complain about is the cast is different from the original.
3,Interesting Premise for a Sequel,"This is not a bad sequel from director Joshua Logan. It more or less picks up where MISTER ROBERTS left off but is presented with an entirely knew cast in familiar roles. Robert Walker Jr. is Ensign Pulver. Burl Ives is the Captain. Walter Matthau is good as Doc. He has the cynicism and wit but lacks the good-natured purpose of being that William Powell demonstrated in MISTER ROBERTS. To its credit the film tries to uncover the facade that the Captain wears night and day. Is he really a no good miserable excuse for a human being or is there something lurking deep inside that keeps his humanity from emerging. Pulver sets out unravel the enigma. There are some great moments of comedy and humanity and the film does have a great supporting cast that includes Jack Nicholson, James Farentino, Millie Perkins, Tommy Sands, Al Freeman, Jr., James Coco and Larry Hagman that keeps it all moving."
4,An overlooked classic,"It is kind of surprising how funny this movie turned out to be. I guess it is a kind of sequel to the Henry Fonda film, Mr. Roberts, but only because it borrows a character.I wish they made more films this oddly endearing today"
1,More deceptive packaging from these losers,"It's no mistake that the Studio 99 font is about 5% the size of Credence Clearwater Revival on the CD cover. I doubt anyone buys Studio 99 CDs intentionally. These hacks should be ashamed of their deceptive marketing. Check out other Studio 99 discs, they are all a ripoff"
4,Good information,"After hearing friends and associates getting more energy and also sexual resurection from HGH / DHEA, I read this book and found out you do not have to age at a pre-determined rate. This book gives you the knowledge to make a choice. OK! I'll give it a try."
5,Cult -issim !,"Point Break is a successful film, become cult, mainly among enthusiasts for big thrills (Surf and Xtrem sports), and its soundtrack is quite simply incoutournable ! RATT had never made such a good title (also taste the album '99) and L.A. GUNS is at the Top. The continuation is also 'good spirit', WIRE TRAIN, CONCRETE BLONDE, LIQUID JESUS, LOUDHOUSE, SHARK ISLAND, PUBLIC IMAGE LTD. (quite selected in the film context), WESTWORLD (excellent last CD '02) and not recognized it yet Sheryl CROW ! Only refret, Jimi HENDRIX (the title ""If 6 was 9"" in the scene of the party on the beach) is not on this CD (for reasons of copyrights !)... KWFM.net Team [100% Rock Webzine & Radio !]."
5,Unbreakable wave,"Stunning, Amazing, Breathless, what can you say to the soundtrack that made a Great Movie, a Cult Classic. Buy this sound track if you do nothing else. Waves are up got to run"
5,This is a real gem!,"Simply a great sound track from a great movie. Point Break has long been one of my favorite movies and I really enjoyed the music in the movie so I decided to purchase the very hard to find soundtrack. Upon listening to the soundtrack for the first time, I discovered what is now one of my favorite songs (of any genre). When I first listened to track #10 (Hundreds Of Tears) I was a bit surprised as I didn't remember the song from the movie but (even though I'm not normally much of a Sheryl Crow fan) I immediate fell in love with this song. After doing a little research, I learned that ""Hundreds Of Tears"" was never released as a single or on any of Sheryl Crow's albums so the Point Break sound track was the only album containing it.This soundtrack was certainly the best 8 dollar investment I've ever made!"
3,Who's with Busey. Keanu's with Busey.,"This movie seems a little too hip for some of these bands. But then again, it was 1991. I'm sure today it would include all the ""extreme"" bands, whoever that is. This is good though. There's a handful of metal bands, including ""Ratt"" and ""LA Guns"", both decent songs. The track ""I Will Not Fall"" is catchy, and one of the few I remember from the film. The ""Sheryl Crow"" track isn't bad, but it's years before her debut album came out, and doesn't really sound like her current style. My favorite is the ""Concrete Blonde"" song, which is the b-side of their big hit ""Joey"". I think the ""Red Hot Chili Peppers"" would have been perfect on here, especially considering that the singer was in the movie. Still though, if these songs are good enough for ""Brody"", they're good enough for me."
3,American Girl,"The song playing while Catherine is in the car is called American Girl, by Tom Petty and the heartbreakers."
2,Buffalo Bill's Song,"This album is fine...well produced.i just wanted to point out that the song which Buffalo Bill Jame Gumb is playing while applying the skin suit, and Catherine gets the poodle with teh bucket...the name of this song is ""Goodbye Horses"" by Q Lazzarus. and its spelled just like that. Another reviewer mistakenly titled it as ""Alone"" by Colin Newman....i found that song and it definitely isn't the correct song for that scene. don't even remember that being in the movie....oh well. Anyway, i hope i've helped some other's out.""Goodbye Horses,I'm flying over you.Goodbye horses,I'm flying over youGoodbye Horses,I'm flying over you.Goodbye horses,I'm flying over youGoodbye horses,I'm flying, flying, flying over youooooooo-ooo-oooooooooo"""
4,Yay Howard Shore. But where is Q. Lazzarus?,"You can't mess with the music of Howard ""Lord of the Rings"" Shore. My friend's college roommate used to play this soundtrack over and over to creep people out. It loses a star for the exclusion of Q. Lazzarus's ""Goodbye Horses,"" the song accomanying Buffalo Bill during his famous ""tuck"" dance. Please don't be mislead by numerous commentators on this page that claim this song is originally by Psyche. They did a poor cover version of it. The original is by Q. Lazzarus, and I believe it will be on the ""Clerks II"" soundtrack in a few weeks."
2,That other cool song...,"Besides the Q Lazarus song, Goodbye Horses, the song that is playing while Gumb is sewing the skin suit is called ""Alone"" by Colin Newman. Colin was/is the main singer for the seminal British group, WIRE (who've been together on and off now since 1977). ""Alone"" is from his first solo album, A to Z (released in 1982, a brilliant slab of post-punk dementia). A to Z, was Colin's best most fully realised solo effort, and one of my favorite albums ever. I don't know if it was ever released on CD, but it is worth seeking out."
3,Goobye Horses,"If you like movie scores buy the soundtrack. If you want ""Goodbye Horses"" by Q. Lazzarus go to Limewire and it is available for download. It's a great song. Also- American Girl(by Tom Petty), Alone(Colin Newman) These were also in the movie. Hope this helps. You can also get those songs on Limewire. I've found that practally anything that was not on a soundtrack could be found on that site!"
4,A Very Fine Soundtrack,"An ambient and well constructed movie that helped make ""The Silence of the lambs"" one of the best films of the 1990's. The chilling music is in a league of its own, the use of sound effects is well put together. The music gave the movie a chilling darkness that few other pictures have matched. Shows how important a good soundtrack is to a successful and acclaimed movie."
5,Great Value,"As the other reviewer stated, this is a great value. The set starts in 1931 and goes into 1952. I started with the latest and am now on the first (1931), and now I know why people like John Coltrane studied Sidney Bechet. Why Stanley Turrentine paid tribute to him. This guy sounds better to me in the earliest recordings, than the later ones. Some great vocals by Trixie Smith, this is the blues. The sound quality is great, especially considering the years. I bought a Lester Young cd once, the sound quality was so bad, I returned it. Jazz fans who haven't heard Sydney, owe to themselves to give this a listen."
4,Super Cool,This is a great series for those who like action and magic/sword fighting..in the traditon of LOTR. They lowered the price on the box set too to under $69! Pick this one up and then use the coupon to get $10 off the box set..great idea
4,Top choice to prepare for CIT Exam,"This book is great, it covers all study materials for CIT exam. If you have studied the book thoroughly, you will pass the exam.Of course, you must have many practical experience on Cisco router that would be definite advantages."
3,Wallace and Gromit Curse of the Were-Rabbit Collectible,I bought the Wallace Action Figure to be among the group of action figures I bought to use as a decoration in my kitchen. My husband and I are great fans of Wallace and Gromit. We show the movie to our friends and then they understand the figures as a decoration. It is great fun and brings smiles to their faces. We do not have children and the figures are not used as toys. They are collectibles to us and just fun to look at.
1,What the...?,"As a fan of the Wallace and Grommit franchise, I bought the Wallace action figure expecting that it would be a bendable toy. It is not. It seemed like this would have been a no brainer for the manufacturer. Aside from manually raising and lowering the way-too-long arms,this figure does nothing (it does not hold any other position and the waist is glued into the hips). Can't give it to a kid because it does nothing fun. its more a display item than anything else. If you are expecting the construction of this toy to be similar to the bendy ""Gumby"" type toys, you're in for a disappointment. I've always enjoyed Mcfarlane brand of toys however this one isn't very good."
4,My Review,These are very comfortable and you can wear any color of socks. The only con is that it needs elastic at the top to keep them up. I do like them very much.
1,HATED IT !!!!,"These stockings were a GREAT disappointment, and a waste of money. The worst part is, I could not return them. They are cheaply made, have no support whatsoever....and this is without trying them on. You can just see the cheapness in them without trying them on.Don't do like me, and waste you money cause you cannot return them. Mine are just lying in my dresser drawer waitin to be thrown away."
1,Disappointing,"This item was not offered with a size chart, it was just small - x large. Being 6'1"" tall, I was assuming the x large would be ok. They were way too short and seemed pretty cheaply made. I doubt the stirrup part of the stockings wouldhold up very long. I returned them."
3,Easy to put on and affordable,These stockings do the job but are very noticeable when you put them on but I do use them more than my Jobst at this time during my pregnancy.
4,Good product,"These stockings are a welcome change from the usual footed or open-toed support stocking, which tend to make my feet feel strangled. The material is stretchy and supportive, but these are only suitable for under long pants, not sheer or natural-looking enough to show in public."
1,UGLY....,"Lumiscope Stirrup Stockings Pair, Extra LargeI sent these back the day I got them. They were tacky, poorly made and the strangest color. The seam is very large and bulky. My sister said they were green, but I'm not sure what they were. I have a similiar pair that I bought that are very nice, but these were not."
4,very good product,"This product was very good. Unfortunately, it can give you pressure sore spots from the seams, especially on the sides of your knees. I enjoy the stirrup because my feet are able to breathe comfortably."
2,"Cheap, and short.","The thread is already coming off after just a few times of wearing. Fabric is Very shear, and not real resilient. They were supposed to be knee high, but barley come half way up to my knee."
5,Great read,"I found this at my college's library when I was looking for Serbian literature. It's a quick, easy, and good read. The style and tone of this book is similar to several Czech and Russian pieces I've read before.I liked the book so much that I purchased it for myself to keep."
2,Doesn't live up to other Firm videos - 2.5 stars,"I was very disappointed, I was expecting much more from Tracie Long...This video is OK.The music is rather boring, it's slow, and the cardio segments on the step are very low intensity.I couldn't get my heart rate up at all.The lifting segments are very general, consisting of very few lunges, step ups, and curls.I would recommend this workout for a beginner to the Firm or for pregnant women.If you are someone who is familiar with the older Firm workouts, this probably won't do much for you either.As a side note, The Hare is literally the same thing, it isn't any faster and it includes some general lifting segments."
3,Board book for very young children,"This story is very short, but appropriate for young children (4-6 yrs.) I was looking for something that gave more in depth information about St. Nick and what he did so long ago. We were looking for a book that would help our 9 year old understand how Santa Claus was ""created."" This book did not give enough information, but was a cute book for younger children."
4,a healthy way for children to understand Santa,"We have a copy from 1977. This book teaches children at their level that Nicholas was a man, a kind man, a religious man. It tells the Christian message and the REAL story of St. Nick."
2,This is an abbreviated story!!,"I was excited to find the Santa Are You for Real book to get for my son after having grown up reading it. Much to my disappointment, this board book has abbreviated the part of the story that I found most interesting and most significant: the story and history of St. Nicholas. Without delving into this history, the book seems like it's missed the point. I'm not sure why the whole story could not be incorporated into this board book and I highly recommend that readers get their children the original story. It's much more worthwhile."
3,I was disappointed .,"We bought this book ( Santa ) because we have the Easter Bunny Book (which we love). The Santa book does a great job explaining the story of the real St. Nick. After telling the story and explaining that Christmas is about giving, they show a picture of a Santa Claus winking. I found this to be very confusing The reason I wanted the book was to take the focus away from Santa and on to Jesus. I felt this book really contradicted itself at the end. I will continue to read this book to my children , but will not include the last page and wording."
1,Ok Maybe I Overexagerated,"In a previous review of this book, my words were perhaps ill-choosen and put down in the heat of the moment. I basically picked apart and trashed Scott Malensk's book without full justification seeing how I am not a published author. (Not yet anyhow) While I will not change my rating of the book I do retract the majority of things said in the review. Until I have the time to write a more appropriate review let me just leave it at this: I did not enjoy the book, it was not what I expected, but I do believe that with the proper edits it can be made into a novel that has the potential to be big. Very big"
2,Just OK,This book is really just ok - I liked the Your Pregnancy Week by Week book much better...better information and quality. This book is actually spiral bound and just seems cheap.
4,safety ratings,"I researched this seat quite extensively before buying. My first choice was the Britax companion, but at the time it was brand new on the market and STILL no one in our area carries it. I wanted something that I could look at. I do agree that my daughter gets too hot in it. I love the leveling base. You can unscrew it, get the seat belt as tight as possible, and then rescrew the base to get an awsome fit for those of us that don't have new cars. The shade takes a learning curve. All you have to do is push the plastic part toward the seat to unlock it. It would be nice if it were bigger. The major reason I went with this seat is that it actually has styrofome in it... like the Britax to absorb an impact. Almost all the infant seats have nothing to protect the baby in an accident except a seatbelt and a piece of plastic."
5,So pleased with this carseat!,After extensive research we purchased the Primo Viaggo carseat and the Pliko 3 stroller. I could not be more pleased with either. The real test came when I was visiting family and used their Graco carseat. There is no comparison when it comes to quality. My daughter was miserable in the Graco as the fabric is not nearly as high in quality and she kept leaning over to the side. I also think that the Primo Viaggo is more stable in the car and while it may be heavier it seems to be easier to carry.We have had no problems with this carseat and would recommend it to anyone!
5,The best car seat!!,"Not only is this car seat is very cute and soft,our son loves it and so do we. we first bought it to go with the venzia stroller but, we now like it because its easy to install. Also when the baby is a newborn it tilts back farther so the babys head doesnt roll around. Well worth the money !!"
4,Not Great,"This car seat has it's pro's and con's. My biggest con is the shade. It does not stay opened to cover the baby. It also is not large enough. The other is that it can not be used without the base, making traveling a little hard on airplanes. It does have great fabric and looks nice. Very easy to clean."
2,Great for the first 2 months! Baby Outgrew too quickly!,"The carseat has great fabrics and is of wonderful quality but, our tiny 4 month old who is only in the 24th percentile in weight has already outgrown this seat. The shoulder area is too narrow and she appears extremely uncomfortable & cries when we put her in the seat. Her feet are already hanging on the end. The fabrics are great and are very easy to clean. The carseat is in my opinion the best looking on the market but, not the most practical. The sun visor provides very little coverage - I have to hang a blanket over the visor and handle to protect her. We are in the process of trying to find her another carseat which was actually neccessary 2 months ago. I would not recommend this seat. Sometimes the most expensive isn't always the best."
1,Disappointed!,"I registered for this car seat to make a travel system with the Aria stroller. This carseat is way overpriced and has many flaws. The canopy is so small that it rarely shades the sun from my baby's eyes. The fabric made my baby sweat - it doesn't breathe. It seems heavier & clumsier than some of the cheaper models, especially the handle with no cushioning. I am also disapointed that it fits in NO shopping cars, I am constantly worried that if someone bumps my cart, that he will fall over. My son is 4 months old and almost maxes out on the height requirement. That is a lot of money for 1 car seat ($169) plus two bases ($69 x 2) for about 5 months use that was not very efficient. I wish I had bought the Graco and used a snap n go until he was big enough for the Aria stroller."
2,My daughter hates the Primo Viaggio car seat,"My daughter is 4 months old and for the past 3 months, she screams each and every time we put her into her infant car seat. She seems to be squished and bent in an awkward position. The whole process of putting her into this seat and taking her out is just impossible. The handle on my seat is so difficult to move back and forth; only my husband has the strenght to do it. So when I have to take her out, I have to take her out of the seat horizontally so that she doesn't bump her head on the handle. I went back to the store where I purchased the car seat and stroller because I assumed that there was something wrong with my seat but I found out that they were all like this. I am really disappointed. It is so annoying that it is just easier to stay home than to take her out in this seat."
1,NOT SAFE!!,"I took this car seat to my local fire department for safe installment and I was told it was an unsafe seat for my baby b/c there is so much cushion b/w the baby and the plastic. The more cushion, the more air, and the more unsafe for baby. I am going out to buy a graco snugride. Do not waste your money on this seat, even if you want to buy a peg perego stroller to use with it."
2,Nice but not worth the money.,"I bought this carseat b/c of the name and it got good reviews. It is okay...but the only problem is that the cover is not machine washable. I didn't know this b/c it didn't have instructions on the cover. So when I washed it (my newborn spits-up often as most newborns do) it fell apart and the batting is showing. Something that costs as much as this should not fall apart when you wash it. If you are looking at getting this carseat...don't...your newborn won't be in it that much and you need something you can wash. Get a britax...I have had no problem with my Britax carseats, and I have had them for four years. Oh...Peg Perego customer service is not that great either."
2,I wish I wouldn't have chosen this car seat.,"This seat was OK at first but by the time my son was 3 months old, he hated it. He was very uncomfortable and cried every time I put him in it. I picked it out because it went with the Peg Perego stroller I wanted and was rated high by Consumer Reports but I was very disappointed. It was a very expensive item to use for 3 months. I changed to the Britax Roundabout convertable seat and my son was happy as can be! But then I didn't have the carrier feature to attach to carts and carry in and out. I would definitely not recommend this product."
2,Both our sons outgrew this seat by 7 months,"I was very disappointed with this seat for the money. Both of our boys are of average size and the seat became snug by the time they were barely 7 months old. It might be fine for smaller than average infants but for this price, I thought I'd get more use out of it."
2,Paying for the name,"I bought the Primo Viaggio for our grandson. The quality has much to be desired. The warning tag is all frayed and stringy, the opening for the straps is also frayed badly making the car seat look ""old"". Keep in mind that the baby is only 8 weeks old and has not been in the car seat all that much. I consider this to be far from normal wear & tear! For the price...........I would expect this product to be of finer quality and be useable for at least 2 babies. I am contacting Peg Perago Co. and requesting a replacement . . . maybe we happened to get a lemon!"
1,Do Not Buy,"The material used in the current line of Peg Perego car seats is neither breathable nor absorbant. My daughter sweats terribly. Her head is dripping when I take her out of a climate-controlled car. (She was not overdressed.)Also, the plastic housing around the harness adjuster has cracked after limited use.The company would not refund my purchase price. The manager suggested I sell the car seat and stroller on eBay or at a consignment shop! I would not subject other children to this product's numerous faults."
3,Great Seat if YOU DON'T TRAVEL !!!!,"I am getting ready to fly and just found out that this seat has to have the base attached. I am soooooo disappointed that I bought this seat. Yes, it is the highest rated seat, but has none of the features that the Graco or Britax has. 1) needs a base, but 2) the canopy is not big enough. I have to unhook the back and have the sun hit slightly on my son's head in order to cover his full face and/or legs. This makes my walks horrible!!! I have to move the canopy multiple times and cannot enjoy a brisk walk. Even though my friends recommended this seat as the best, I would never buy it again and will be asking Babies R Us to do an exchange."
3,Not what I expected!,"I expected this car seat to be the best. My major complaints are that the material is hard to clean and the seat is way too narrow. My son is 3 months old and is already squished when in the car seat. He does not like being in it at all. I registered for this car seat because I had heard so many great things about Peg Perego. Now that I have been using mine for a few months, I think a Graco or Evenflo is just as good, as well as half the cost. I am extremely happy with my Peg Perego Pliko stroller but would recommend new parents to go with a Graco or Evenflo for the infant car seat."
3,Just okay,"We bought this car seat to use with the Aria stroller. When my baby was very small it was fine. She was snug and comfortable. She outgrew this very quickly though. The seat seemed too narrow by the time she was nearly four months old and we soon really began to feel the weight of the carseat, which wasn't such an issue when she was a newborn. The material is very warm (which didn't bother me so much cause our baby was a winter baby) and I can't imagine it being practical during warmer weather. Also the shade doesn't provide much protection at all, it was way to short. Overall though, it is an acceptable carseat for a very newborn, if you're willing to pay that much for just a few months of use."
3,Look at something else,"This car seat is very safe but does leave a lot to be desired. My son is almost 3 months old and barely fits into this car seat. It is not wide enough to accommodate a larger baby, the canopy leaves A LOT to be desired, and the fabric does not breathe making my child's back very sweaty. I did call Peg Perego's customer service (which is fantastic) and asked if they had a better canopy which they did not. The customer service department suggested I sew some fabric on the canopy to make it cover better -- get real! If Peg made some adjustments to their seat, it would be fantastic. I am going to look at a Britax."
3,"Too small, and synthetic material too HOT for baby!","Like many others, I bought this system b/c of the high safety reviews. And to be fair, safety is the most important thing. I hate the synthetic fabric, however. Even though my baby was born in Nov. (in cold Chicago!), all winter her little head has been drenched in sweat when I take her out of the seat. :( Also, the seat is quite heavy and awfully small. My daughter is in the 95th percentile in weight, and I know I will not be able to use this seat much longer (she is now 4 months). Also, some problems with the stroller: closure latch and cup holder broke in my first week of using it!"
2,Base Will Not Install Properly,"My husband and I were ecstatic when we received a Peg Perego travel system for our shower. We love the stroller and infant seat together, BUT the infant seat base is unable to be installed properly in our Subaru Forester. Our seatbelts are too thin and the accessory that is supposed to take care of this problem is to large to properly fit on the belt between the base and the latch. As a result, the carseat slides from side to side. The fire dept. personnel has recommended we not use the infant seat in our car."
3,Average Car Seat At A High Price...,"When we registered, we decided to get all the main items by Peg Perego in Black/Sable; high chair, carseat, stroller. And yes, the carseat looks really nice, but there is nothing special about it. The thing that really bothers me is the hood, which I need to use a lot more than I expected. Every time I try to pull the hood down to shield my daughter's eyes from the sun, the whole thing pulls off. You would think for the cost they would at least put in a few snaps or something to hold it in place. If you are not sure about spending the extra money, don't..it's really not worth it."
3,DON'T BUY FOR THE NAME,"I purchased this car seat when I was expecting. I had to have it because it was Peg Perego and I had the nice stroller to match. It was nice looking by appearance and style. Not thinking how my child would fit in it. He is 4 months and is already hanging out of it because he is long and in the 50% mark for his age. So he is pretty average. Not to mention it is so heavy to begin with and with him in it now at 4 months is a big pain. I went with an infant carrier instead of a infant/toddler seat because I need a infant car seat to prop him on shopping carts or at restraunts, since he does not sit up for the cart or a high chair. And my child always sweats while in the seat. The shade cover hardly covers like most other car seats out in the market."
3,Great looking seat but too small........,"I purchased this chair for my baby boy who was born prematurely. I thought it would be perfect for him since he was so tiny when leaving the hospital and always thought he'd remain rather petite.....not!! He quickly reached 10 pounds and looked like a chunky little wrestler trapped in tiny little car seat. I removed the side padding from under the cover to give him more shoulder room. This will probably only last a few more weeks then I'll have to go out and purchase a new one.I'd give this seat 5 stars if it were bigger because it were bigger. If you like the style and only wish to use it for a month or two, then this is the seat for your child. If not, then I'd suggest getting another larger seat which your child will be able to use for at least a year."
3,Look at others first before buying this one,"I have no complaints about the safety of this seat, you feel your baby is safe when he's strapped in this thing. However, the sunshade is awful - it doesn't even come close to blocking out the sun, and my son sweats in it no matter how cold it is outside or in the car. The fabric is just too hot. It's also very heavy. My son is now almost 13lbs and I have a hard time carrying him in it. I only bought this car seat because my husband wanted the stroller that matches it. I wouldn't use this seat with my next baby."
2,Looks OK ..but baby uncomfortable,"This car seat is good for a couple reasons 1)It looks nice 2)It installed safely in my car.....but now the bad. My son hated it!! He is a big baby and was only comfortable in this seat his first month of life.Although I think this car seat is safe and fashionable, it only gets two stars because it fails on the most imporatant feature...comfort for your baby. No one wants to pay $150 to hear their kid scream everytime they get in the car."
2,Good for 3 months,"My baby was born 9 lbs and outgrew this carseat in 3 months. The paddings on the sides make fitting a larger baby extremely difficult. Also, if you live in a warm climate, the upholstery makes the baby sweat as soon as you put the baby in. I definitely do not recommend this for larger babies and for those who live in warm places. I switched to Marathon Britax when my baby was 6 months and I wish I had bought it from the very begining."
3,Not too impressed.,"We bought the prima vaggio with the Aria stroller. The stroller has been great but the car seat was too tight. The fact that you can detach the car seat from it's base is great, specially for a newborn. We were able to buckle her in at home instead of trying to do it in the car. Our daughter out grew it at 4 1/2 months. She used it during fall and winter in So Cal and the fabric would make her sweat. Even though the weather was in the 70's. After she outgrew it, we bought a Britax and it's much more comfortable."
3,It's O-K....,"This carseat wasn't as great as I thought it was going to be. I first registered for it b/c this brand was what ""all the new moms were getting"". My son was born very little (only 6 lbs) and in July. He was sweating in this carseat after the first week or so and always cried in it. He grew so fast that by the time he was 2 months old, he was 14.5 lbs and squished into his carseat and cried even more when he was in it. His backside was always hot and sweaty. Not only that, the Primo Viaggio infant carseat was heavy to begin with but with the added weight of the baby, I was struggling. We bought the Britax Marathon carseat and changed him into it by the time he was 4 months old. He LOVES his carseat now and enjoys every car ride now that he's not squished, sweaty and uncomfortable. Seems that it was a waste of money to only use the infant carseat for 4 months."
2,UNSATISFIED,"I should have listened to the reviews! I am really disapointed with this seat. It's difficult to use, the material is unbreathable and starting to come unstitched, and the smallness of the hood hardly keeps the sun out of her eyes. The seat is just entirely too small, my baby is just over 3 months weighs 13 lbs and 24 inches long is just about grown out of it.My mom has a little arthritis in her thumbs and can't push the buttons on the handle to move it. Way too much money for the seat, but like other customers, I too love the stroller."
1,tight fit for baby and your wallet,"We were excited to get all the top-of-the-line baby gear for our new baby including the peg perego car seat. it was not worth the money. The seat is way too tight for bigger babies. Our newborn was eight pounds and he was so snug in it, by ten pounds he felt squished! It claims to hold infants up to forty pounds but i don't think bigger babies will fit. Not only was it tight, the nylon material made his back wet with sweat, which made him hate it even more. The sunshade canopy is just for looks and is too small to shield the baby from the sun. It won't even pull over to shield the baby's face. We went out and bought the graco carseat which is roomier and lined with comfy cotton. We had to learn the hard way that the most expensive is not always the best!"
3,"It's a good looking car seat, but expensive","I purchased two of this Peg Perego car seats for my twins @ around $149 in 2003. The price seems to go up by $20 this year. The seat is not good for ""big babies"", but it was not a problem for our babies and I think the fabric is just fine. The seat definitely looks attractive but heavy to carry around. Car seat and the base did not stay in place all the time, and we had to check the installation often to make sure it is safe. I wish I didn't spend so much money on these car seats. There are many other safe car seats in the market that cost less than this one..."
2,Good Car seat,I bought this seat beofre me son was born. Initially I had bought it because it was a Peg and everyone has told me it was the best. It is great.. Granted my son grew out of it when he was 4 months but it was great mwhile it lasted. Althoug it was really heavy and hard to carry when he got above 11-12 Lbs we just clicked it into the Peg Atlantico stroller and we were off. I recommend this seat to anyone. the down side to this car seat is that you need to get the seat professionally installed. And once it is never take it out. You will never get as tight as the pro did ever. I promise you this.
3,Annoying Noise!,The base of this car seat has a metal levelling ball encased in plastic that rattles and rolls around while driving which is very annoying (more to the driver than the baby). We've taped a heavy duty magnetic in place to stop the noise.
2,mother of a big baby,"If for any reason you think you may have a large child I would not recomend this car seat. My baby was only 8 pounds and 20 inches at birth, and at 6 weeks(12 lbs and 24 inches) he has practically outgrown this seat. I have taken out the head rest and he still may have only a good 4 weeks left in it."
3,"Safe, but uncomfortable!","I am not happy with this car seat--it is too small! It also does not fit securely in my car when placing it in the middle seat and I do have the latch system--even after buying the cushion as an extra. My daughter is 3 months and barely fits in it. She screams each time I place her in it. My daughter is thin but tall for her age and it is even narrow for her! The head rest sits below her head and she looks so uncomfortable and gets very hot in the seat. I love the stroller that goes with it, but the car seat is terrible! Sorry, I'm just being honest. I do like Peg Perego products, but I would choose something else if I could do it over again. The reason why I am giving it 3 stars is because it is a very safe car seat. I can't wait to put her in the Britax todler seat, I hear they are far more comfortable."
2,Not happy with car seat or Peg Perego's services,"Car seat fabric has hole and tag is fraying after only 4-5 months. Peg Perego basically said they wouldn't do anything about it because the date on the bottom of the carseat says 2004 even though I recieved it brand new from the store. Also , I have the Venenzia stroller and the Peg Perego sticker peeled off (I hardly use the stroller.) I've heard that the stickers peel off a lot."
1,TOO TIGHT FOR BIG BABIES,"I thought I was buying the best...and I would have been if I had given birth to a premie! My 10 week old son (at 13 lbs. and 24 inches)barely fits in this seat anymore. His shoulders are squeezed into the seat and he looks very uncomfortable...and may I add often cries when I put him in it because he can barely move in the thing. As I result, I go against my ideals and loosen the chest and shoulder straps on the seat when he is riding in it and have to hope that we are not in an accident. On top of that he gets very overheated in this seat, even in light layers with the AC on. I will be writing to Peg Perego to let then know that (1) this car seat was a waste of my money and that (2) they need to redesign this carseat with bigger babies in mind...don't waste your $$$ on this one if you have even the slightest chance of giving birth to a large baby."
2,Stay away,"This car seat is probably the worst one on the market. To begin with, if you have a large baby, he/she won't fit in it to long. It is very narrow. Also, the hood is so small, it offers no shading during a sunny day. If you are using it with the stroller at the same time, you may find it difficult to place inside the stroller. I find that I have to remove the tray to the stroller if I want to secure the infant seat in place. The only thing I like is the color. For the money, it is not worth it!"
2,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"This car seat was not worth the extra money. My son was just over 8 lbs when born and had outgrown this seat by the time he was barely 4 months old. This seat is very narrow and deep in comparision to other infant carseats. He also was wet with sweat everytime I took him out of it (he only wore 100% cotton clothing). The sun shade when retracted rests a couple of inches from the top of the seat, instead of at the top of the seat, taking up head room. This seat is just too expensive for such a short use. I would NOT advise anyone to purchase this seat."
2,Somewhat disappointed,"I bought this infant seat with very high hopes. My Mother had Peg Perego for me when I was young. I bought the black sable infant seat along with the stroller. The seat is very attractive and very well made. However, it's extremely uncomfortable for my Son. When he was born he weighed 6lbs 4oz and it was alittle too big for him. When he blossomed to 11lbs 8oz it was too snug for him. It's very narrow and another thing is its very HOT. My Son would come out of it sweating no matter what I tried. Coat, no Coat. Air conditioning, no air conditioning. It was terrible. Very disappointed for the amount of $$ it cost."
1,Not Worth It!,"I registered for this car seat based on the reviews that it ahd at the time which were all positive. Also I've heard good things about the PP products so I decided that this was the carseat for me. well I wish I didn't! I despise it and my 5 wek old daughter agrees. she gets sooo sweaty in it even on a short ride. Also it squishes her on the sides and she is by no means a ""big baby."" As far as ease of getting in and out of the car, I have an SUV and it is very difficult to fit in and level it safely. The sunshade also is a joke. It does not do anything to protect for the sun. Please either get a Britax or Graco snugride."
1,"Nice, but not worth the price.","It really is not worth the price. It is a nice carseat, I have the black sable, but it has too many drawbacks. The first one being that the fabric makes my son sweat. Even if he is in just a t-shirt, he comes out of the seat drenched. He hates being it, and screams every time we put him in. The second drawback is that it is very small. My son outgrew it in 3 months at 14lbs and 23in long. The third thing I don't like is that you cannot install the carseat without the base...inconvenient if you're going on an airplane and are trying to travel light. The carseat looks good, but you are better of with a Graco Snugride...which is a fraction of the cost of this one, I went out and bought one, and I love it."
2,Too Big,"We recently got this seat, but and had our baby a month earlier than she was due. The car seat was much too big for a preemie, and the hospital wouldn't discharge us unless we got another car seat before we left. We ended up getting a Graco seat which worked much better. We chose this car seat since we got the Peg Perego stroller, however the Graco seat fits fine in the stoller too. The Graco is also much easier to use for 1/2 the price."
1,This carseat is not worth the money,This car seat is horrible for the cost. You would think that this thing would hold up. NO.....I am currently using a used car seat from my sister's little girl. My baby is almost four months old and she is already grown out of it. All the little strings are coming out and the fabric is separating. Save your money and buy a 40.00 car seat. This car seat is not worth it!
3,Expensive for the usage,"My daughter grew out of this seat at 6 months of age, reaching the maximum height limit for the seat before the weight limit. The seat was snug and comfy for my daughter, even when she was first born. And although not the easiest to get her in and out of, by being forced to adjust the straps each time you put your child in, you always check it's correctly fitted - the 5 point harness is very secure. The fabric trim has snagged in one place where I caught my ring.Overall, an expensive way to buy a car seat, but if you want everything to co-ordinate, the brilliance of the Venezia stroller more than makes up for the misgivings of the matching car seat."
5,This Book Spoke to Me,"I was looking for some answers in my life. I have spent a lifetime in church, but that isn't what impressed God. God wants me. He wants a relationship with ME. That is what this book was talking about. It was a real person talking frankly about real issues. No pretenses....just being real. It opened my heart to DESIRE Him more and to know that there is more to church than just the service. There is just more than the Sunday 10-12. Now, after reading this book, there is the desire and the thirst to seek God. This book also gives guidelines on how to develop a relationship with Him. It is the huge missing piece I have needed ALL OF MY LIFE!"
3,Too small but good value,"I was looking for something that I could put my handgun in while in its original case. Unfortunately, this isn't made for that. It's good if you don't like your original gun case that you got when you purchased your firearm. But, you may want to get something bigger. For right now, I am using this for my ammo boxes and cleaning kit. Otherwise, I am going to by the bigger Smith & Wesson bag. As far as the quality, it's top notch. Heavy and durable material. Just not the size that I was looking for. I want something I can put everything in."
3,S&W Range Bag - a little small,"This is a fairly nice bag, but smaller than I expected. I suspect this is the same bag S&W; was giving away with any handgun purchase a couple years ago. It's good for two pistols, ear and eye protection, plus ammo and cleaning supplies.For the money I think you can do a lot better."
4,Different but still good,Different richie kotzen album. I think it is his only solo album that I actually skip a few songs. Only 2 I have to skip. Overall a great album especially compared to the popular stuff that is out today. Recommended but probably his worst.
3,Not what i expected,Okay let's throw out the filler tracks and rate the cd on a whole. There are 1-3 strong songs on the cd that i really like. Then there are some of the soul inspired songs. I don't have anything wrong with that at all and anyone who knows Richie Kotzen knows he is heavily into bluesy and r&b styles of music. My proplem with it is some of the crappy drum machine fills that are put in. I have been through the cd once so maybe it gets better. This cd has potential instead of marvin gaye or barry white when having one of those intimate dinner nights. Surprise your girlfriend and put on something differant.
3,it's ok so far,"i bought this for my NF jacket and i've worn it in the rain, so far it works but i think it would work better with more then one application. so if you do buy it, try 2 apps before you test it."
1,Does not work as advertised,"not only does this stuff not work but when you spray it, the can leaks at the nozzle and i would not recomend"
3,tried to fix pul n diapers,i only gave it 3 stars just bc i think the pul is to far gone so didnt quit work for what i got it for
1,It may LOOK cool but....,"...it sounds terrible. The unit sits on a wobbly piece of cheap plastic and is not worth the money. If you're buying this for a pre-teen who has yet to understand or appreciate a good sound system but likes flashing lights and doors that look cool when they open, then this is for you."
4,Good Sound-Better Look,"The speakers on this unit left just a little to be desired in the bass department, but the dang think looks so cool on the wall of a 15-year-old's bedroom that I can't complain. My son loves the remote feature and the three-disc changer is certainly a plus. I haven't heard one complaint from him about this system and that's saying something from a kid who complains about the temperature of the breakfast milk. I'm very highly satisfied with this gift."
5,By far the BEST!!,"My son received this blanket shortly after birth. He is nearly 2 years old now and it has been far and away the best blanket we have. It's soft, warm, and big enough still to cover him completely at bedtime. Not only that, all stains seem to wash right out (it's off-white). I'm expecting again and was actually online to order a 2nd one for the new baby. You won't be disappointed with this product!"
2,too bad...,"This blanket would be perfect if you didn't have to wash it. It is my 2 year old son's favorite, by a landslide (and I have tried replacing it several times). It is cuddly and soft and is a good size - but you just can't wash it without causing noticable damage. I have replaced it twice now and am past due for a new one. You will have to decide if you want filthy blanket or a tattered blanket which is threadbare and holey. My son would rate it 5 stars if there were a review site for toddlers but since this is a site for mothers, wamsutta chenille gets a disappointed thumbs down. Too bad...."
1,Dangerous!,"I purchased this blanket for my nephew when he was only 6 months old. He loved it. He is now two and I have purchased 2 more of these blankets. They started to wear down quickly after washing and drying them. Each time he goes to bed at night he still searched out the blanket from when he was 6 months old. It is his favorite. The blankets wear away and become almost see through. However, there were no hanging strings. Recently when he woke up my sister said she went to get him, and he pointed to his neck. He looked at her and said ""Uh Oh!"" She noticed during the night, some blanket strings had wrapped around his neck and were very tight. I would caution anyone who purchases this blanket! Most kids have a favorite and this is not the one you want them to choose! There is another chenille by wamsutta that is better! It is also hard to take away a blanket that your kids really love."
2,Still my 4 year old favorite blanket,My 4 year old has slept with this blanket since the day he was born. The only problem is if you wash it do not dry it or the material will shed in the dryer. We are on our sixth blanket and I have to still by another because he will not sleep with out it. We also ran into a problem when he is upset he will chew on it and the material comes off in his mouth.
4,favorite blankie,My son has had this blanket since they day his was born 4 years ago. Santa has given him a new blanket every year and to see the smile on his face is worth buying one or two a year.
4,Missing part of Venice sequence in Anna Karenina,"I can confirm Mr Sharafyan's observation. I have a tape, recorded in 1989, of a BBC transmission of Anna Karenina. In this version, and missing from the DVD, Garbo calls the boy on to the gondola and gazes at him for a moment before March gives him a coin and sends him back to his friends. At this point reel-change dots appear on the screen and there is a cut to a next-reel shot, with Garbo looking pensive and March saying 'We're still in Venice', which Garbo (thinking of her son) answers by referring to the look in the boy's eyes and suggesting they return to Moscow, as the scene fades out. On the DVD, without the segment of the boy actually on the gondola, Garbo's comment about the boy's eyes hardly makes sense because he is only seen doing cartwheels. Could there be any significance in the fact that the fragment missing from the DVD occurs at the end of a reel? An error in transferring the film to DVD?"
5,Great for a lover of classics,"If you are a lover of classic movies and their iconic stars, then you can't go past this very complete look at this fabulous actor Greta Garbo in her best movies, along with recent documentary on her life."
5,Great Purchase,"This was a most interesting purchase, just what I was looking for, thanks for the great response.. Will work wit you again"
5,Garbo is wonderful,This classic is a wonderful adaptation of the book. Garbo is beautiful. She is a joy to see. I enjoy watching it many times.
5,"Garbo ""Signature Collection"" DVDs",The best of Garbo's movies all in one package...what else could you want? The special DVD on the life of Garbo narrated by the superb Julie Christie was outstanding!
2,The movie,It is okay movie. I definitely like tho see the new movie with keira knightly . This move did not bring up some of the important fact in Anna Karanina 's live. Like the birth of her daughter with Vronski.
5,WOW!!,There is no one that compares with Garbo on the screen today. She had a presence like no other. I am thoroughly enjoying this collection. Well worth the price.
2,a classics illustrated comic book would give you a better impression of tolstoy,"garbo is radiant but there is no other reason to watch this highly abridged telling of tolstoys novel. while im used to hollywood (by necessityt) removing whole sections of a loooong book, this is incomprehensible to anyone who hasnt some previous acquaintance with the story. even the usually reliable fredric march and basil rathbone (one of the greatest hams ever) cant save it."
5,Greta Garbo,she was a myth an now that I watched all her movies I wonder why? Actually are a few versions of the same movies but she was unique.
5,Great,Fast shipping and the item is exactly as described. The price was just right and I'm glad to be able to see all these great movies. Thank you.
4,THE FELLER THAT PLAYED THE PIANNER,"These recordings were made for the Rex label between 1935 and early 1937, during which period Charlie Kunz and his band were playing at the Casani Club in Regent Street. This was a discreet private club, and that is reflected in this compilation, which presents a first-rate dance orchestra, but which somehow lacks that extra ingredient which would have lifted it into the five star category. But there's much to enjoy here, including two piano medleys by Charlie, George Barclay's vocals, and three early contributions from a young Vera Lynn."
2,ITS NOT SUGARLESS,"Its not sugarless. Read the ingredients (too late for me) and its 500 packs of gum you get not 100 ( 2 boxes, each has 10 5-packs and each pack has 5 sticks of gum) too late my staff opened it when it came in so i couldnt return it."
4,Rock and Roll and Punk and Thrash,Fantastic energy and changes cmoplmented by alternations between the backup vocalists. The two songs that Jay sings aren't very good but the rest are full on pedal to the metal and preparing to REV IT UP AND GO!!!!!!!!!!!
2,The Trouble With Tab,"Ever take a guitar lesson over the telephone? I bought this to help me work out ""Mann's Fate"", the first few measures of the tab are nothing like what Jorma is describing in the companion CD. Jorma rattles off finger positions so quickly on the CD that one needs to play it over and over to grasp what he is saying, as in: ""First finger fourth fret third string second finger fifth fret fourth string pinky finger second string fifth fret"" Got that? I learned my first chords in 1965 from a fellow who was learning from Jorma at the time so I am not a novice to Jorma's style.To learn Jorma's fingerpicking I would suggest a DVD or video where you can actually see what he is doing. This book is not for beginners."
1,Deeply Flawed Transcriptions,"I tried to buy the sheet music for Jorma Kaukonen's ""Embryonic Journey"" but it wasn't available anywhere, by itself. Thus, I had to purchase an entire book of his songs, which would have been fine if I had not discovered that the transcription of ""Embryonic Journey"" is riddled with inaccuracies and down-right musical impossibilities. It's absolutely unforgivable to release music as flawed as this. Fortunately I have the skill to watch videos of the song being performed by Jorma and others on Youtube and I can figure out most of the errors in the transcript, but I shouldn't have to. I contacted the publisher via email, Hal Leonard, and received a polite response, but the reality is I will never by another thing from this publisher.Just for the record, while I'm not much of an acoustic guitar player, I have been playing electric guitar for 39 years, and have a BA in music so I know what I'm talking about."
2,Disappointed,"The previous PBR compilation was a quality production with various artists doing the songs. I gave them to friends as gifts as an introduction to country music. There are some good songs on here, but the production is poor and there is only one singer. If I'd wanted a CD of Brett James songs, I'd have bought that. No where in any of the advertising, nor on the outside of this CD do they let you know that James is the artist.This cd was obviously produced for the rodeo crowd only, not for music fans. I'm amazed that Tim DuBois would put his name on it as producer."
4,Great Book if there is no loan involved.....!,"Potential RE invenstors will have to read between the lines of Ron's folksy style. The techniques outlined in the book can make you money however, it is not for the novice. Rather this book is a brush-up for insiders. I believe that the tapes and seminars are necessary to complete your education, as is networking locally with others.Inexperienced investors will be on a steep learning curve for over a year. Does it work? Can it work? Yes, quick turning a house for fun and profit can work if there is little or no mortgage on the property.What if you can't sell it in your expected time frame? Guess who gets to pay for the mortgage? This simple fact can wipe out any profit you could have realized by a rise in the property value.Long Story Short, a good prelude, has some promise. Making Money with little or no money down and a huge mortgage? Nah.. Making Money buying property outright? You Betcha....."
2,not for everyone,"I orignally bought this book from television and with the accompanying tapes thought it would help me get started.I was wrong. This book would work best on anyone living in a time warp. He talks about buying houses for 10,000 dollars and then quick turning them.Excuse, does he live in this country? I live in New Jersey and a decent house starts at 100,000. He is totally out of the ballpark.Then when I bought the program, I was told for 1,000 dollars more, I could buy a whole series of tapes and the privilage of attending his seminars. If I could afford to spend the money his tapes required, I wouldn't need his course.The book is too just scratching the surface and things that I am interested in like rental property he dismisses and he advocates putting properites on your credit card. If you can't pay it off because the propery isn't selling, your screwed.He should tell people that this book is not for beginners or the faint of heart."
1,Superceded,"This is an old book. This character has written a new one, same kind of bull. If you're greedy and gullible, buy that one.Maybe some day you'll be in bad straits, and some rogue will get in on robbing you of your abode. Not this guy,though. He just writes books and runs ""seminars"" in chintzy hotel rooms in front of people who want to get something for nothing and have nothing going on in their lives."
3,"Nice outline, but you need to buy his seminar to get details","He gives a lot of good examples of how to make money in real estate, but doesnt give specific details on how to actually go about it. For that you have to go to one of his seminars."
3,"Good basic book , A good way for the novice to begin",Every potential RE investor needs the basics and Ron will give you a whole lot more... where else could you find out how to develop a plan for personal and financial independence for less then the cost of a good meal .... a must read
3,For Ibby fans only...,"Bought this on a whim. I love the NGBD and have always enjoyed listening to Ibby (Jimmy Ibbotson)when he talks at concerts and I've read his blogs from time to time. This effort, independent of the Dirt Band, from the 90's is an uneven disc. Some nice high points when Ibby carries the load singing and song writing, less so when he lets the other Jimbo's lead the way. They're just not up to his level, or in my opinion a professional level at all. And the numbers Ibby does are nice, but you know they would have been better done by the Dirt Band. In fact, one of them was, Sarah In The Summer.Still, I found the disc listenable and will keep it in my collection. For what ever reasons, Ibby has often had an on-again, off-again relationship with the NGBD and has been gone from the line up for a few years now. Too bad: they're better with him and he's better with them, too. Oh well, never say never."
3,"Comprehensive, but sample exams are useless","This was a good book to help me prepare for the LPIC 101 and 102 exams, which I passed. It is very comprehensive in its coverage and encompasses everything you will face on the LPIC exams. However, the sample questions and the sample exams on the CD are trivially easy compared to the actual exams. If I had to do it over again, I would not use this as my only source to study."
3,"kindle edition lacking, but good book","I have not finished the book, so I don't have a comprehensive review.I got the kindle edition....there are some ""extra"" spaces in the kindle format - making some commands and paths appear to be different than they are, once you get use to it, it is not a big deal - but one issue with the kindle I have noticed i hope they can fix.also the kindle edition lacks the flashcards and CD content. I am waiting to hear from amazon what plan if any they have to accommodated these features in tech books for the kindle format.the book so far is written at a very low level - great for newbies, but this is an entry level exam so I don't see that a problem."
3,too small,"I was disappointed when I opened the package. The board is small, the checkers are too small, and its hard to stack two checkers. One of the pegs has bigger leg, and it cannot fit into the hole of the Chinese checkers's board. I need to cut it thinner.But overall the board looks nice, and my 5-year-old loves it."
2,functional but not that great,"Chinese checkers - the wooden pegs on my set don't fit into the holes drilled for them. Go for a set that has marbles.Checkers - The pieces do not sit on each other very well when you stack one on another. The chess pieces are magnetic, it would be nice if the checkers were as well.The pieces also have to be packed into the drawers pretty tightly to get the drawers to close, and then good luck getting them open again.Other than that this set does the job, but I wish I had either spent a bit more to get a really nice set or a lot less to get a serviceable but cheap set."
3,'Storage' drawers should be bigger,"My 6-yr old daughter loves checkers & chinese checkers so it's proven a good Xmas gift. And this will likely be a good starter chess set.However, the would-be storage drawers would be more practical if they were actually big enough to hold all the pieces without a fight. Every time I open either drawer it's a battle to close it again, whether the chess pieces in one side or the checkers & chinese checker pegs in the other.If you're looking for a **small/compact game set for children** (or players with petite hands!) then this is okay, but if you're looking for a full sized set for adults then skip this one and keep looking...I'd give 'Fun' 5 stars but the drawers are a hassle.Also, please note we've only been playing with this game for 4 days so I'm only guessing on 'Durablility.'"
2,Falls apart,"This is my 2 year old daughters favorite blanket and it goes everywhere with us. We are on number 2 and you can see through it. It is a nice blanket, very soft, if it didn't fall apart I would give it 5 stars. I guess if it doesn't become your childs ""buddy"" it would not be a problem since you wouldn't have to wash it so often."
2,disappointed in durability,"I bought this blanket because it felt so soft and warm, and I expected a high quality, durable product because of the Wamsutta name. I have been disappointed though. I have washed it only twice, according to the recommeded care instructions, and it has lost most of the material between the weaves. The blanket looks like it is 20 years old and I have only had it for 6 months. I am very disppointed with this product and I certainly hope Wamsutta comes up with a more durable, but equally soft baby blanket."
3,disappointed,I was a little disappointed that this track did not build a complete circle. You need two boxes. At #30 a box I think it is very expensive. I bought this so my son could run his toy story train on it (because of course that does not come with track) and was disappointed when he was sad because it did not build a circle.Now I need to order more at an additional $30 a box.
5,Needed more track,We needed more track for the train that was purchased last year. These additional pieces made a huge difference. We want to buy more train stuff now!
4,just fun..,"If you have any of these then you already know how great they are. they are very durable. i have stepped on a few pieces and not break them.. (115 lb. gal) but it does hurt I will tell ya that. I guess it could break if it was treated badly. Of course they are fun, they keep my son busy for hours especially since he has tons of these tracks. Educational, well yes in some way...my son has to figure out just how much track he needs, short, long, straight or curved to complete his track. So yes they have to think and re-do their track if it won't work out. I have seen my 7 year old have to think, ok if I put this piece here then what else will I need and that sort of thing. After its done and put together, not so educational but still fun."
1,Overpriced by Amazon Vendor,"Legos are one of the best toys for children. They enhance creativity in children and are fun for all. I rate the toys themselves with the highest rating.However, I can not say the same for the Amazon vendor. This vendor practiced Christmas price gouging and I feel Amazon knowingly allowed them to do so. It reflects poorly on Amazon and henceforth I will limit my shopping with them.Practice caveat emptor when dealing with Amazon and Amazon vendors."
3,The great Gleason,"Music to Change Her Mind is yet another typical Gleason album from the mid-fifties: lush violins, very slow pace, saxo soloist. Rather pleasant, although it is a bit repetitive."
5,pasquale,"this is absolutely a must for fans of melodic rock, aor and westcoast....fantastic melodic songs,both easy listening and a littel more rockier stuff.he has also made a superb version of Cris Rea`s -fool if you think it`s over,even better than the original.you have to listen to this one......"
4,wonderful gift idea,I was given this book as a gift and am really enjoying it. The photography is beautiful and the recipes are very easy to follow. I highly recommend it!
2,Much much better than the last book...but...,"Okay, Katie's other books on cooking and decorating were AWFUL...and this book is a big big improvement.The book is gorgeous: great photography, great layouts, great paper...worth every penny.The ideas are so-so. I don't get the weekend concept here... this stuff is just a random collection of things like Asian dinner party or Moroccan feast... isn't that more ""theme"" entertaining stuff and not really projects I can do in 48 hours?So underneath the pretty photos, you do see the real Katie Brown... and I'm not saying that's a good thing."
2,Needs real game play,"It's an okay video. The host of the video puts off a jerk vibe but he knows what he's talking about. The video ran through different strategies for playing craps and what some of the out comes could be. He runs through all the strategies quick too. I would have liked to seen some real game play where each of the strategies are put to the test in sample games. I wouldn't recommend this video, you can read a book and get just as much out of it."
5,Good picks,"There's not much to say about this pick. I like medium picks and this feels comfortable.They wear a bit faster than I would expect, but far rom being a problem. It may just be my style.The 12-pack seems a good balance between cost and quantity."
2,Not what is pictured,I ordered these expecting 6 different color guitar picks ranging from light pink to dark pink and dark purple to light purple. What showed up was 12 bubble gum pink guitar picks. Kinda disappointed. Would have been nice for the description to mention this.
3,not bad,"This isn't a bad book but it,s clearly a load of dated articles stuck together in an attempt to teach those who wish to make drawers & boxes a little something that in my opinion takes a long time to truely master. It's suggested in the book how easy it is to make dovetails, I've been making kitchens for years and it takes a long time to learn what you really NEED to know about these things. Take it from me it's easy to talk the talk.There are better books out there that cover this subject in a more informative and enjoyable manner, try any of Jim Tolpin's woodworking books and you,ll see what I mean."
5,Classic Treatises,Some of the very best from the early years of Fine Woodworking Magazine by some of the Titans of the Seventies. These techniques are as fresh and informative today as they were when they were written.
4,Rusty is among my favourite lyricists/singers,"I can't recommend this album enough. Fans of Beck's ""One Foot in the Grave"" album can't go wrong. Go see this band perform live. Yeah yeah yeah..."
1,Bad sizing chart,My daughter was so excited for this costume. It came just in time for her school party. However the boot covers and the wig were way to small. (I think the wig would fit an infant-maybe!!) My daughter is a small 9 year old(wears size 7 in jeans) So I thought 8-10 size would fit. It left her in tears!
1,Misrepresented,"Unfortunately, this costume looks like a lot more than you acutally receive. Definitely order at least one size up from normal. The pic is adorable and the wig looks so big and puffy. It is not. It is tiny-and good luck finding another bright orange wig. My little girl loves the costume idea but we'll be searching. If you buy this-you'll be out looking for more."
2,Wig is too small,"My daughter is 4. I bought the size Small. The dress fit perfectly, and I absolutely loved it. However, the wig was way too small for her head. So, we had to return it, and am now forced to buy a totally different costume. She's really bummed out. :-("
2,Listen to all the reviews,I read all the reviews on this costume but I purchased it anyway. My daughter is such a huge Daphne fan that I thought it would be worth it anyway. As all the other reviews state - the wig is way too small - it would not fit any head and I ordered 2 sizes larger - the dress does not fit because it's way too big. The scarf is just as flimsy as all the reviews state. The boot covers do not stay up on their own. I guess it was not worth it after all.
2,Girl's Daphne Costume,"Cute costume, however the wig was pretty unmanageable and didn't fit over my daughters' hair, The ""boots"" didn't make it past one trick or treat outing."
1,Not so great,Bought this for a halloween costume for my daughter. The dress looked more magenta then purple and the wig did not stay on at all. The boot covers were distroyed before my daughter was even done with her party at school. I do not recommend this.
3,Got it despite the warnings,My daughter wanted to be Daphne so badly so I got this costume looking for the cheapest price. i actually got a medium for a 4 year old. It was long but it all fit. The wig I had to cut the back and it did not stay on very well but just long enough for pictures. I'm hoping she will want to be something else next year.
3,Runs Small!!!,"Almost happy to read that this left other children in tears like it did mine! She is small for her age, so I thought the size small (4-6) would be perfect on her. Wrong! The wig is definitely too small, I have no idea how I'm going to get it on her head for halloween. Definitely a mood ruiner!"
3,Coulda Shoulda been better,"It's a long time after Halloween, but I was reminded of this today and realized I'd never reviewed it. The costume was a good idea that should have worked. The other reviews all mentioned that the wig is too small, and needs a lot of work. It was extremely small; I think we actually had to cut it to get it to fit her scalp, and we got the largest size possible for her age. The green scarf really makes the costume, unfortunately it was so scratchy my daughter refused to wear it for more than five minutes. The shoe coverings that make it look like Daphne's wearing mod boots is great, but only has a strap running under the shoes to keep it attached. By the end of the night, those ""boots"" were too bedraggled for another use.I think it was a great concept for a costume, just not carried out well."
2,Not what was expected,"My daughter was very excited to be Daphne for Halloween, but I could see the disappointment in her face when she tried on the costume and it did not look nearly as good as the picture. The dress is fine, however, the wig is awful and cannot be styled to look anything like the picture as it is very short in the back and bangs are flipped in the wrong direction. They should not even include the item they call the ""scarf"" as it is a very short piece of green material that looks like mosquito netting. The boot covers were OK, but could use elastic to keep them higher up on the legs. Overall this costume is not a good value and I would not recommend it to others."
4,daphene halloween costume,Very cute daphene costume!!!!! My 2 year old niece loved the wig:) she Didn't want to take it off......... It does run Small!!!!!
4,Scooby doo Daphine's costume,"I got it for my daughter she is 5 but she is tall. So I got the next size up. Everything fits perfect except for the wig, but my daughter's head has always been big. I just wish it was strechy. The important thing is my daughter loves it and is happy about her costume. I recommend it but not the wig."
4,Definitely Daphne,"The wig is fun, very big and full. The dress fit my 7 year old well. The scarf was not as pictured, very flimsy. The boots covers go over the child's shoes up to the knee."
3,Cute for the price,"I was hesitant to buy this costume because of the reviews it had received but my 4 year old daughter really wanted a Daphne costume. As recommended in the other reviews I bought a size bigger than I would have typically bought for her. Although the dress on her is below the knees, it is still cute on her and the wig does fit her head. The boot covers probably won't last long, but for the price, I don't expect much of the costume to last more than a few months play. She is totally happy with it which is the best review I can give it."
1,Worst costume ever!,The costume was skin-tight on my size 6 child (says it fits a size 8-10) and the wig would not even go on her head. We had to cut it and then use bobby pins to keep it on. It was a huge disappointment and almost ruined her Halloween.
1,So sad,"Could have been so cute.... The wig was too small, which I was prepared for after reading the other reviews but it also just shredded everywhere. The dress didn't fit right and the scarf was an inch wife. I've bought other costumes from them that are so much better."
2,"Cute costume idea, not worth the $$$","This costume really isn't worth the money. My daughter wanted to be Daphne for Halloween so I ordered the small, she's 5, and it fit her well. However, the wig is terrible and we opted to use orange hair spray paint, which looked so much better. The scarf and boot covers didn't get used either, I made my own green scarf that looked much better. So, I wish I would have just purchased a purple sweater dress for my daughter (since that's the only part of this costume that got used), I would have saved some money."
3,"Cute costume, but wig not what the picture looks like",My daughter loves this costume. I got it a size bigger than she normally wears and that fits well. The wig is not very full and she ended up using spray color for her hair rather than the wig.
1,Buc fan's enjoy this dvd because there will never be another superbowl in your future!,It cracks me up reading what you bandwagon Buc fan's posted on here.We all know the Raiders had the better Team and it took a former Raider Coach to win this game.If you did not have Coach Gruden you would of been pounded by Gannon's passing attack.....Raiders will be back and the Buc's will never see another Superbowl so enjoy this dvd now selling for $1.00 on this site.The Raiders have 3 Superbowls and have been there 5 times so not a huge deal.Our fans our loyal as I see now in 2010 Buc fans are nowhere to be seen....
1,Misleading search results,I bought this DVD on the basis that Shania Twain performed the half time show. Even when i did a search for Shania Twain this DVD was listed - INCORRECTLY - as there is NO Shania performance on the DVD. As far as the football goes i really can not comment as i am from the UK and know nothing about American Footbal - sorry!!!
1,Where Is Shania Twain?,"When you do a search for Shania Twain this video pops up. I can't even find her in the half time show. Is there a football player with the same name? She is the greatest female vocalist of all time and is much prettier than those football players, but I am sure she doesn't play football. LOL"
5,A must-have for all long-suffering Bucs fans!,"particularly for those of us who don't live near Tampa and were unfortunate enough to have to deal with the ABC play-by-play during the Super Bowl instead of turning down the sound on the TV and hearing Gene Deckerhoff call it on the radio...now we can hear Gene's version!Michaels & Madden are professionals - and they were great for the Super Bowl...but give me Deckerhoff anyday! (Go Bucs, Go Noles!)"
3,Close But No Cigar,"This DVD is ok,but not great.It does have every play from the telecast,however it has been edited down to less than 1 hour.Sokickoffs and huddles have been removed.It does recap every gameof Tampa Bay's season including playoffs.Also the radio anouncers of the Super Bowl are used so don't look for ABC'Screw.And none of those great Super Bowl commercials either."
4,hotrod hillbillies,"Very solid album with a rockabilly feel. Standout tracks are Git Gone, Pissed & Depressed, Alone & Blue, She's The Devil."
2,"Nicely illustrated instructions, Little else","I was anxious to get this book for my son who is a precocious builder. However, I was disappointed to see that the gadgets you can build were not described at the beginning of the instuctions. The gadget is named, then the building instructions begin. There is no description of what the gadget does, or how it works.I was pleased to see that most of the items need to make the projects are easy to find, since my son already experiments with electricity. However, starting from scratch will mean a trip to the electronics store for most people."
3,Meets expectations,"Considering what we paid for this book, it meets our expectations. A bit difficult for a 8yr old. But helps to increase awareness about electricity amoung childrens."
4,Great beginner's toy,This one is a little challenging for harness use (you will have to go to the hardware store to find an o-ring snug enough) but its size and shape make it a breeze for beginners. Would totally recommend!
4,Smaller than expected,"This really is a very small dildo. It's 5.25"" long and 1"" at the tip and slightly less the rest of the length.It is a nice soft, silicone and is a bit tricky for harness play because it's so short and it can be hard to get ""reinserted"" when you inevitably slip out."
1,Flimsy Material,"This item is very flimsy. The material that it's made of does not have the firmness that you would expect from this type of product. It's also a little small. If it was a larger and a little firmer, I would say that this would be able to do what you wanted to do. As it stands now, I would stay away from this"
2,"Not bad, although derivative and implausible","clearly derived from Heyer's ""A Civil Contract"", Byrd manages good dramatic tension between her characters despite the fact they are pretty much the stock-in-trade Regency types. However, there is a major hole in this plot -- a charge of treason, if proven, forfeits the traitor's properties and title to the Crown. Therefore, the villain would never have accused his cousin of treason, for he would have had to petition the Crown afterwards for restoration after ""accidentally"" discovering the exonerating evidence once the hero had been beheaded. That process often took months, even years, and since the villain had beggared himself obtaining the proof of treason, disclosing it publicly made no sense. Ms. Byrd is a better writer than many, but she needs to pay better attention to the historical background."
1,"Weak Characters, Weak Romance","I was really disappointed with this book and had trouble finishing. After I read all of the 5-star reviews I was expecting so much more. The main character, Robert, came off as weak and cowardly whereas his wife was like a doormat for most of the book. It's a shame since the storyline had a lot of promise in the beginning."
1,SUX,"Take those who rated this as a suxfest at their word. Picked this up cause it was a The Fire Theft single and was thouroughly disappointed, I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I offered to give it to my roomate at the time and he hesitated taking it from me, he must of heard me play it one of the three times total that I even tried to. A musical abomination coming from such musical genious. I would of given this a half or even a 1/4 star, had that been possible, and I am a fan of these guys since Diary."
3,"Good sway-bar kit, cheap mounting","Great upgrade kit for the price, front sway bar hits A-arms a bit, so you will have to shave a bit of metal off of them. Not a bad install, rear is super easy, but brackets seem very cheap. Auto-cross will make or break them. Labeled it a three because its a good kit, just rear brackets and front sway bar bushings are kind of cheap."
1,I didn't find this at all helpful,"As stated, this book did nothing for me. As a writer interested in finding a drug reference book to refer to when giving a character a drug abuse problem, this was a waste of money. Focuses on history rather than effect, which is my main gripe; the blurb is very misleading."
4,GREAT INFORMATION,Its very informational and is exactly what i wanted. Read this book if your interested in find out about all different kinds of drugs for either ur own knowlege or for a paper for school
4,A to Z,This book has been around for years the title make you believe if you eat chocolate you will end up on morphine.
3,Good info,"Lots of good stuff on drugs.But Weil seems to make the assumption that virtually everyone is involved with illegal drugs, and that simply isn't true. He should have added a chapter about how people can have happy lives without taking illegal substances."
2,Indica vs. Sativa Cannabis Comparisons Not Mentioned!,"The book's title is a misnomer. Compare on the Internet for the important differences between indica and sativa marijuana and their hybrids. Knowing that LSD, `shrooms, peyote and mescaline are engines of sorcery is integral for children with classics like `Peter Pan,' `The Wizard of Oz' ..."
3,Way smaller than it looks,"I thought these were platter sized, but they're only slightly larger than the dessert plates. Love the products overall, though."
3,Smaller than ...,I thought these plates were platter size ... and they are not. Quality seems okay. Shipping and packaging were good. I wish there was a bettr description.
3,it's ok...,"i've read around ten guides in this vien. read, 'home maintanance for dummies' it's much better/cleared. this guide's just ok. sorry"
5,"Great price, usable","Looks like a great book, came in good/fair condition. Now to just find the time to read it. Thanks a lot."
4,a really groovy book,"Ina Mae learned midwifery on the job, and did a great thing with it. Most obstetricians would/should be envious of their very low rate of interventions and their ability to trust women's bodies. The groovy language can get in the way for some people but the message is strong and clear. Good supplemental reading for people who want a safe and empowering birth"
4,Good - but prepare yourself for the time warp,"I enjoyed reading the birth stories contained within this book. The language was pretty dated, and was an interesting look into this community's social fabric. Their findings came through learning by doing. And with each birth you could see their confidence grow and they became more expert at the process. Its not for everyone, more suited for those who have already chosen natural childbirth as a course - and won't be turned off by frank discussion (detailed) discussion of the birthing process. They have interesting spiritual observations about giving your man his 'power'... and being peaceful and holy while birthing - avoiding becoming - complainy - but grateful for being in the state... worth a read as part of a larger investigation."
2,Very hippie/free love era,"I wasn't really pleased with this book. It was ""far out"". In the furthest sense of the word! There were women who were talking about being stoned during labor, and the use of ""pet names"" for various anatomy was a little much. The language is very 60's. (And this is supposed to be the revised for the 90's version!) There is some good factual information, but nothing that can't be found in other books."
4,Still not the original BUT...,"This movie is MUCH better than ""Journey to Joke A Lot"". The Care Bears stay in Care A Lot this time and the focus is on caring for and thinking about others rather than just yourself. The central character is Wish Bear but all of the other care bears play a part, including three new bears. This movie was much more tolerable than the first CGI. I still don't like it as much as the 80s movies (where's the Care Bear Stare for example) but it's a cute movie."
5,Favorite Movie,This is my little girl's favorite movie. She would watch it all the time if I would let her. Great short film.
4,Good service,"I received the video, but because they used a bubble pack envelope and the case was broken. The video was not damaged."
3,warning- can't repeat chapters etc..,"This movie is great, and my 3 yr. loves it, but as for the DVD itself, for some reason it wont allow you to repeat chapters, entire movie or use the a/b function on your remote to repeat a smaller part of the movie. I have tryed on 3 different dvd players, and still nothing. This may sound nitpicky, but if your a parent, you understand how a little one will find a certain song, or part of a movie, and want to watch it over, and over, and NOT being able to repeat the dvd is very frustrating( when your used to it on other dvds)- So just a word of caution on the no repeat--"
1,Still have not received,I don't know if my grandson likes this or not. A month later and we still have not received it.
1,Didn't like this at all.,"I only watched this movie to see how bad it would be. Unfortunately I was proved right. I absolutely loved the original care bear movies from the 80's but this was awful compared to them. To borrow an old saying: ""out with the new in with the old""."
2,I'm scarred,"The carebears big wish movie was horrible. THey never should have used CGI to make what use to be a wonderful show. I'm scarred i'm scarred for life there is just no other explination for it. They killed the carebears! The carebears big wish move is on disney right now and it has gone CGI. WTF they ruined it. They really killed them there colors are all wrong( cheer bear isn't even pink and tenderheart isn't brown),the only facial expressions that they can do is open and close there eyes and mouths, Carealot looks like a barren wasteland instead of warm cuddles of clouds and joy,and the stars look like demon monsters. I hate it. What have they done! Carebears are suppose to be cute and fluffy and cuddly and not look like emotionless statutes. I hate CGI with cartoons i prefer animation. sure live action special effects use cgi but leave my cartoons alone **crys** WHAT HAVE THEY DONE!"
4,Nice stuff,"A very fine and delicate record, for fans of the harmonies of Brian Wilson. Like Cornelius, Louis Philippe is interested in great sounds and good songs. Philippe is a recluse from France who does love songs in French and English. This record is actually a compilation of several albums done for the Trattoria label. Songs such as ""She Means Everything To Me"" and ""Every Day Gone By"" remind me of 10cc, and the fact of Philippe's great influence on Momus. He was just recently in New York, but thanks to someone unnamed I was not able to see him perform, which is a great regret. It's good that people are still making tender and careful records like Louis Philippe, because many talentless buffoons who make a real big noise sometimes get all the attention. A good record for Sundays and late at night.(www.freewilliamsburg.com)"
1,Has Brass Buckle; not Nickle,I didn't open the box upon receipt -- it is not brown; it is a very very dark brown (perhaps even black) and it also has a brass buckle; not the nickle buckle shown on the website. Amazon immediately gave me a return authorization.
2,good (mostly),"Arrived in what looked like good shape, except the cooling plate anchor posts were broken.I jury rigged it by screwing some screws in and it is working fine now, however kind of poor design of the little plastic posts, as all 4 were broken, and too much hassle to ship it back. If I had to do again, I would probably take the time to go to a local store and buy it rather than have it shipped."
2,Dead on Arrival,"The fridge arrived DOA. Light came on but the compressor didn't. Turns out that the compressor was no good. You would think they would plug these in at the plant before putting them in their boxes just to see if they work. Also, the metal shelves were packed loosely inside the fridge causing them to bang around inside the interior while in transport. This resulted in a broken plastic piece off the door shelf. Finally, I went to the Danby web-site to find an authorized service company. Two listed are out of business and fortunately, the third was able to make a house call and inform me of the bad news. Amazon was very helpful in arranging for an exchange.I gave it two stars because the size is great for corny kegs and it doesn't have an annoying tiny freezer section in it to waste space. Design good for the most part. A bit bothersome that the temp control requires a coin or screwdriver to operate. No normal finger dial or knob. Danby quality control is abysmal."
4,Good Fridge for the Price,"After doing extensive research on compact refrigerators, we ordered this Danby, knowing that other Amazon customers had mixed reviews on it. It arrived a couple of days after ordering it and was double boxed for shipping. Unfortunately, the inner original box used by the manufacturer was damaged (why would the seller go ahead and ship a damaged carton w/o checking the contents first?!) Of course when we took the fridge out of the inner box, we found the lower back corner slightly caved in. Although we considered returning it, we decided that since it sits in a space under the counter and the back is not visible, it wasn't worth the hassle. We let the unit sit for 2 days before plugging it in, and so far, it is working just fine. Unlike other reviewers, we don't find it to be loud. Love that it is just a fridge w/o a freezer and doesn't require any defrosting. Like the price and would have given it a higher rating had the seller not sent us a damaged unit."
2,PICTURE IS NOT ACCURATE!,"This is a ""new and improved"" model with the drink/can keeper on the door...which makes it impossible to put 2 kegs inside as shown in the picture. It will only hold one keg - which is really sad, because everything else about this fridge is perfect for using it as a kegerator. Seems like a great fridge, but don't buy it for a kegerator unless you only have 1 keg you want to keep cold.."
1,Poor Design.,"Gee, this was a terribly designed fridge. I have ordered two of these. The first one had a bent hinge, which I had to have Danby replace. The second one had a corner smashed in, AND the bottom hinge bent. Who on earth would design a fridge with a bent hinge and a smashed corner? I don't get it."
4,"Great fridge, bad vendor","There aren't a lot of compact refrigerators out there in this size, without a freezer. This one also has a built-in light, which is useful and storage for larger items, such as 2 liter bottles. Our unit arrived quickly... maybe too quickly, as it arrived with two large deep dents along the right edge of the door. There is a long story that goes with resolving the problem but I'll go straight to the bottom line. We spent two months emailing the vendor, Price Pros (Texas), to get them to replace the unit or even to ship us another door. They refused to take responsibility for the damage. Action was finally taken only after we requested an RMA number. Even then they did nothing, referring us to the manufacturer. It took another two months for the manufacturer to replace the door."
5,"Arrived double boxed w/o damage,energy meter reads $18/yr -- really good buy","My 20 year old GE frig 'hiccuped' and pretended to die (we unloaded it and left it unplugged a few days, then it revived. I assume it will be dead by summer),I needed a reliable replacement and ordered this Danby.It showed up on the last day promised (what a relief!). After reading that the frig needs to sit unplugged for a couple of hours, I waited then I put an old style (not an instant read) thermometer in and put the frig setting as low as possible. I plugged the frig in and waited til the compressor turned off to check the thermometer temperature.It was at zero degrees (F)! So, I backed off the setting and later read 45 F. Tinkering got me to 38 F which is where I needed to be. Next I plugged in my ""Belkin Conserve Insight Energy-Use Monitor"" expecting the Energy Star's $35/yr. The frig is unloaded and I've been running the energy test for 36 hours, the reading is $17.80/yr. Love it!"
5,Love it,Good size under-counter fridge that doesn't have a miniature freezer inside taking up room. The price was great-- much cheaper than our local distributor! Replaced a GE that died after 1 year of use-- expecting much better things from this unit!
4,Danby refrigerator,I spent many hours researching mini fridges to find one that had no freezer and was not too small. This one fit the bill. Too bad about the damage inflicted because of poor packaging during shipping. I was forewarned by the the reviews but thought maybe there had been enough complaints that they would correct the problem. Not so. Mine works fine and sits in an open closet where the big dent on the side and the crushed in corner do not show.
5,"Great for beer, wine and other beverages",WE searched and read a lot of reviews to find this frig. It exceeded our expectations! Fits large wine bottles -- lots of stuff and keeps things really cold. We bought 2!
1,Excited for nothing.,fridge came in just the display box itself like it would on the shelf of a store. the package was practically destroyed leaving a huge dent in the top corner of the fridge. it looks really bad. very upset upon arrival. I do not like the fact that i paid almost 200 dollars for a fridge that wasnt shipped with any protection and arrived damaged.
3,Too small,"Okay let's be honest, every college dorm room needs a mini fridge. I bought one for my brother for his room, and at first he loved it, but it was too basic. The freezer area was too small so you can't really put much in there and overall its just a really small compact fridge. I know they are supposed to be small to fit in small places, but this fridge gave out within a month. It's better to spend a little more and get a better quality fridge that is going to last years. I found one that actually has drawers in it and its own freezer section. It's the perfect fridge for any small space.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003B3ZLCA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B003B3ZLCA&linkCode;=as2&tag;=amazon070f-20"
4,"Five star product, One star packaging.","Just as many other reviews have stated, the packaging for this refer is very substandard. Having read other reviews before purchasing, I gave the package a good look before accepting delivery. Once the box was open, I noticed two healthy dents at the side/rear. The dents are minor cosmetic, not bad enough to warrant the stress of returning it, but I wouldn't have accepted a dented one if I had a choice.When I first opened the door, it fell right off. However; the door hinges were easily adjusted with a few light hammer taps, and I'm confident the door won't fall off again.Otherwise, I really like the functional interior layout. It has nice shelves on the door for canned drinks and no freezer to worry about. It has a high quality look to it. I just hope the people that packaged it are not the same people that built it."
3,Classy Little Fridge,"Love this fridge. First thing you notice is that dumb little freezer is not included. Who really made ice cubes in a their fridge this size? So you get more space to hold stuff that just need refrigerated, no hassle of defrosting and uses less energy.Shelves are all adjustable, door has nice can rack and other door shelves can also be height adjusted.Also a very professional, clean look for a small office refrigerator.UPDATE: Not in love with this anymore. The temp settings are not sensitive enough. You either get kinda cold soda or frozen solid. No in between. Also things on the lower rack freeze versus others racks."
4,Works great for a Korney/Soda keg.,"Bought this to replace the wine fridge I had been using for my keg after I drilled a hole in the side and the coolant came spewing out. This time, I drilled a small hole in the top behind the controls for the tap line and it is working fine. I didn't have to take the door panel off since I'm only cooling one keg (put it on the left side). At 75%, the fridge ran all day and got really hot inside the cabinet I put it in (a few ventilation holes weren't enough). However, I turned it down to 50% and the keg is plenty cold and the fridge doesn't run much and I can't feel any extra external heat.So far, very happy with it. I am using a converted soda syrup type keg and it fits just fine. I'll post pictures if someone wants them, but other reviews have plenty."
2,"Danby Fridge only, but inconsistent temperature","We searched for a mini fridge that didn't waste space with a useless freezer unit that freezes over, & were pleased to find this. However, it's a good thing we got it only for a temporary holding place of beverages; the unit does not hold a consistent temperature. So, if you're looking for something that will match the performance of your full-sized unit, keep looking. Food poisoning, anyone? Also, the unit arrived missing a foot. Despite repeated attempts to get it from Danby by emailing the company repeatedly, & emailing numerous copies of the receipt (none of which they could ever find, but refused to send the darned thing anyway), we gave up--which is probably what they wanted to happen in the first place. All in all, if you only need an overflow area for NON-perishable food items, this is a handy little storage unit, but I'm not sure I would feel comfortable labeling it as a refrigerator."
5,Great Office Fridge,"Very good fridge for the money. Compact, good looking, quiet. The can holder in the the door makes it easy to store soda or bottled drinks. Love it!"
3,Love a black box?,"Replaced something similar purchased at Home Depot which gave reasonable years service before expiring unexpectedly. That had a freezer and also cost less (price comparison not adjusted for inflation). This came to me defective: holes drilled for the door support were off center, when mounted the door could not close properly. Fortunately, the door can be mounted opening from the right as well. This was not ideal, but I couldn't face a long drawn out alternative. This one is a bit quieter than the other, I haven't miss the freezer. I do like the door setup for soda (whatever) can storage. These guys lost a star because their production defect provoked some anxiety and anger."
1,Better water shoes out there,No way could anyone wear these barefoot! It's like walking on screen wire. These were bought to wear in the summer on vacation in Mexico and socks don't factor into my wardrobe. Spend a few dollars more for comfort.
1,Appropriate if you're brainwashing your baby,"My wife and I have bought quite a few educational videos so far for our 11-month-old, and this is by far the worst. It is extremely repetitive-- it consists of the same exact computer-animated spinning shapes with numbers on them repeated over and over, which quickly bored our baby. It's literally the same thing over and over and over. In addition, the whole thing has a weird feel, almost as if it's an attempt at hypnotism. My wife noticed this separately from me. It's hard to explain.The Mozart music playing faintly in the background can't save it, either. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money, or you may wind up throwing it in the garbage as we did. I think it would actually make a child less intelligent to watch this DVD often."
1,Why Did I Buy This DVD???,"This DVD is a waste of your time. I'm not sure why I didn't heed the customer reviews. I had a hard time watching this. It is totally lifeless and uncreative, repeating ad nauseum, like some kind of pain/drug/hypnosis video that would be used by the CIA. Please spare yourself and do not buy this. Sorry to be so hardnosed about it, but, this video is just no good."
1,This is awful!,"I bought this video because I saw how many good reviews it got. Well I put it in and was like ""what the heck is this??"" Its extremely repetative, and very boring. It just shows the same scenes over and over and over. My kids have no interest in it whatsoever. I wish I had never bought this. If you really want a good childrens video check out ""Horatio the lion"" volumes 1 and 2. They are just great!! My kids love them so much. He teaches so many things."
3,Not what I ewxpected,this book gave me nothing that I did not get in my Bible. I was very disappointed in the contents. I thought it would give me more anciant history of the Jewish nation in much more detail.
1,0 Stars,"I hate this book. There is nothing worse to me than ""vegetarian"" when it's not.... makes it so hard to explain to people what vegetarian actually is when cookbook authors include fish as vegetables. This cookbook is NOT vegetarian. Some recipes include fish. A recipe labeled vegan is not vegan, either, as it contains honey.In addition, many recipes are just unhealthy. There is a HEAVY reliance on dairy - several recipes call for more than a stick of butter or several cups of milk.I think this book is a disservice to the vegetarian community at best, and misleading to those starting to become vegetarians."
3,"Creative Combinations, poorly explained recipes","I like the huge variety of recipes, it sparks lots of ideas. However I have found the recipes strangely off at times. For example, page 283 has a Rice Noodle stirfry, where they have you make a sauce, then they never tell you what to do with it. Now this is a pretty basic recipe, but still I found myself almost done cooking with an orphaned bowl of sauce, which I just dumped in. Another recipe for coconut soup has 6 cups of water to one can of coconut milk - its almost not even worth adding the can of coconut milk at this point..."
1,Doesn't fit Graco stroller,"This is a great idea, but the bag does not fit over larger-model Graco strollers (those that usually come as part of a stroller system). Unfortunately, Graco no longer sells a stroller travel bag on its Web site, and we have not found another bag. The Eddie Bauer car seat travel bag is excellent!"
3,Stroller cover,"Make sure that you measure the highth of your stroller when it is closed up, I didn't and it didn't fit my stroller."
4,Versatile cover,The cover protected both my Graco MetroLite Stroller and my Maclaren Triumph. I thought about buying a new bag for my Maclaren since it is an umbrella stroller but I decided to see if this one could be adjusted. It was a little big but since the straps adjusted the stroller stayed put and since I was using it to kept dirt etc... off the stroller it served its purpose. Not to mention that it expands so if I ever need a double stroller it should still work. A great buy.
4,Gets the job done!,"I purchased this cover, merely to use as a cover. I walk a lot around the neighborhood with my daughter, therefore I leave the stroller outside a lot. I wanted a product to help keep the stroller in nice condition and clean. This does the trick. I have a Evenflow single stroller and it is a little bit of a stretch but I can get both of the buckles secured and it fits nicely over my stroller."
1,It was shipped ripped when described as new,"It was described as a new item, but was shipped ripped with a big X to where the rip was and the handle to pull the stroller is ripped. fits the stroller but it was ripped. Did't find the rip until my husband put the thing on and saw the rip"
4,It works,"We used it with our Graco metrolite stroller for our recent vacation, and it held up well. We were able to roll it around with the bag on, (just like in the picture), and it protected the stroller when we checked it at the airport with our other bags. I read another review where the reviewer said it didn't fit the Graco metrolite, so I was a little worried at first but I tried it anyway. The fit might be a bit snug, but it does fit. It just takes a little extra effort to close the buckles."
4,Fits Peg Perego 60/40 Stroller,"This fit my Peg Perego 60/40 stroller. I can keep the top zipped up so that the PP60/40 wheels stick out, or I can unzip the top which allows me to entirely cover the PP60/40. I'll probably do the latter for the gate check, since airlines are notoriously poor at handling strollers. The bag seems quite sturdy, so I'm sure it'll survive the trips we need to take."
1,don't get ripped,Don't buy this unless your sidekick's os blew up. You can't sync or do file transfers yet on the sidekick.
1,Worthless,"There is no real use for the cable, like the other guy said, unless your sidekick's os blows up......its worthless."
2,Simple and Straightforward,If your looking for a simple way of getting your phone to connect with your PC it does not get any more simple than this.In adition it's simplisity it is backed up by it's pricing. On the whole It is a product that serves it's perpose.
5,the king of piano,"this disk is a treat to the ears. i bought 5 copies for christmas presents. i listen to it everyday. it's a piano, with some saxaphone instramental. both are top notch,they compliment each other well. it's the perfect piano lover's disc. i only wish it was longer!"
4,Nice Watch,This watch has a good look to it and was worth the amount that I spent on it. It has good wieght to it and has a nice shine. Not too fancy
4,clear instructions,"Sybex and the authors have updated this long running and successful text with the 16th edition. The rapid changes in personal computer hardware mean that you might want to consider getting this book for its comprehensive advice of a wide range of hardware items.I should say that even with the changes in this industry, if you have the 14th or 15th editions, you may well want to stick with those. Not everything changes between consecutive editions, and those still hold considerable relevance.The book's remit extends across a broad range of hardware. Not just items that might be directly plugged into your computer. For example, there is discussion about routers for your local network. Where these might be wired or wireless devices.Typically, across all the hardware they describe, there is enough information to be able to install that hardware, even without the manufacturers' instructions. Sometimes, the book's instructions may even be clearer!"
1,Johned,Ordered this new edition because of my experience with earlier ones.This edition lacks the CD which the other edition contained.The format of this edition is not done as well as the previous one.I am dissapointed in it's new format and lack of CD.
3,Not what I expected,"I am not a very technically savvy guy with a computer. I was looking for a book to explain to me how I can upgrade my computer and keep it in fairly good maintenance. I saw this one and it seemed to have a good description. It turns out this book is massive, but most of it is devoted to computer peripherals. I was not impressed because it is not a very user friendly book and didn't have more of what it was titled to be. It would be an excellent book for someone that has a lot of time and already should know most of this stuff and what's to change their peripherals mostly."
2,Not too impressed...,"We weren't too impressed watching this video. The person holding the camera focused on areas not too interesting for too long. I think my husband who scuba dives could have done a better job of filming a video. We haven't looked at the still pictures on the dvd yet. Hopefully they'll be okay to look at. We're actually going to Bonaire this month (Feb.08), and I bought this for my husband's January birthday to get him psyched to dive there, but were bummed watching this video. Way too expensive for what you get in our opinion."
1,wrong dvd /poor marketing,They sent a movie that was not the correct zone.The marketing info was unclear and caused dissatisfaction from the customer.It another hassle that I don't need.
1,Was sent to me in the wrong format,"Could not play the product (""In a Lonely Place""); it was sent to me in the wrong format.And then I got an e-mail argument when I asked for a replacement.This, after I have spent hundreds of dollars with this particular company."
4,Bogey's Best,"Here's late 1940's early 1950's Film Noir, a love gone wrong drama. Bogart's ugliness, the angles of his forehead, the lines about his mouth are fascinating. Bogart is both violent and tender by body language. A truly remarkable and revealing performance. Not that the dialogue doesn't matter. It's brilliant give and take, literary musings with tough guy and gal repertoire. Gloria Graham is no piker either. She is the beautiful actress, but there is no doubt she loves Dixon Steele the screenwriter and comes to fear him too. I can't imagine another actress of this period pulling off this love story. And we get Bogart in love, a tough, and maybe psychotic guy in love. His manliness is counterpoint to his unprotected psyche. Also homage should be paid to Nicholas Ray's direction. There is a dark LA at night, eyes in the headlights of a post-war Buick feel in his direction. The story is adapted from a potboiler novel, but the adaptation takes it to another level."
4,BOGIE AT HIS BEST,"Humphrey Bogart gives his most daring and emotionally complex performance in Nicholas Ray's IN A LONELY PLACE.Bogie is Dickson Steele (great name, huh?), a Hollywood screenwriter who is prime suspect in a murder after he lures a cute hat check girl to his apartment to read a screenplay and she is found dead a short time later.Here's a prme example of classic, intelligent, artistic filmmaking by Hollywood's best.This absolutely gripping film has been restored and looks like new. Highly recommended."
3,Bogey loses his temper.,"This is what I'd call a sleeper; a good movie that ""nobody's"" heard of. Bogey has a real problem with his temper in this one."
1,complaint,"I am usually quite careful, so when I received the DVD in PAL format I was surprised and disappointed because if it were clearly indicated, I would not have gotten it."
2,Tries hard but doesn't succeed.,"An ambitious movie, but not one of Bogart's better ones, mainly because of the story and timing. Classified as a noir, although it never occurred to me while watching. Bogart is a Hollywood script writer with a bad temper and a tendency to violence. Suspected of a murder he didn't commit, he falls in love with his neighbor, Gloria Grahame, in one of her bigger roles. Their relationship is tortured by the murder suspicion and Bogart's temper, which eventually destroys the relationship. An unhappy ending. A tragic love affair. The movie focuses on the ""complex"" psychology of the tortured antihero, but it never really works."
1,unable to watch,I was unable to watch this video. I could not download it. Amazon should provide a cloud to be able to watch whatever one purchases.
1,CAN'T USE,"I didn't know what Region 2 was, Mars should have flagged order when the address being sent to was in the US!!!The movie is very good, and scars of the battle still exist on the bridge pillars.I Can't Use This Move, it was a waste of money to buy and not worth the cost to send it back!"
3,Great WW2 Epic -- Movie 5 stars; Video 3,"The movie itself is great. However, the VHS is 10 years old and needs to be cleaned up and re-released. The version played on TCM sounds and looks beautiful, as does the Letterboxed DVD. However, as I said, the VHS needs improvement; once in a while the actors seem to be mumbling and the interiors are at times muddy and dark, making it a little difficult to tell what's going on. Also, the few night scenes are almost impossible to see. Please, MGM, give a new VHS."
2,Hollywood or History,"Unfortunatily this movie was to say the least, a disapointment. It does not cover many of the events that actually happend at Remagen or the fight for the bridge. It was also unrealistic. First of all, by the time the Germans had counter attacked the Allies were well supplied and moving in more troops by the hour on the hour. The fight was fanatically desperate for the Germans not the Americans. Desperate attacks took place including many artillery barages. The counter attack the Germans attempted failed. The only real fight occured taking the bridge not holding it. If you like action get it. If you like history dont."
1,Bridge at Remagen,I paid for this movie but could not get it to play - so a waste of my money! Pissed!
1,Waste of Film,"This film is horrible and should never have been made. Its portrayal of the events surrounding the historic river crossing is disrespectful to those who actually were there, in particular the combat engineers who spanned the river after the original bridge collapsed. The characters are unlikable and unbelievable and couldn't hold my empathy. I gave this movie away less than five minutes after it ended. Don't buy."
3,"Good film, but little realism","The film is not bad, for it's as spectacular as one might expect and the budget is not low: but since ""Saving Private Ryan"" on, genuine military buffs have understood what is that subtle sense of disappointment they feel when watching movies like this: lack of realism, that is portraying war the way it IS and not the way some movie-makers think it COULD or it SHOULD be! Uniforms should look like UNIFORMS and not just COSTUMES, and combat should look like COMBAT and not just ACTING combat. And the same could be said for most war movies of the '50's to the '80's."
2,NOT HIGH ON MY LIST,"I think it is one of the weaker of the WWII films. It does, however, portray an important incident in the defeat of Germany and is valuable from an historical point of view.My main objection is in the depiction of the American soldiers. They sem to be a surly lot, bickering and throwing digs at each other; but who knows, oerhaps that was the case. The Germans seemed to be a better organized group even though they lost the battle.But is it nowhere near s bad as ""The Battle of the Bulge."" That bummer rates a minus five stars."
5,"good ""old"" memories","The Bridge of Remagen brings me lots of beautiful memories of my youth. This movie, Bridge of Remagen, was actually shot in former Czechoslovakia and very close to my little village of Trnova where I went to school. In fact, my dad was working on that bridge when it was built, I believe it was early 1930 and bridge crosses river Vltava. Great movie, great actors, great panorama, great memories on good old times. Strongly recommend this movie for us, 80+ years youngsters."
3,Watch and forget,My thinking is in the title.To much war movies were produce at that time. It s a petty
4,not have engish closed captioned!,what you think that only spanish and french closed captioned in america? that so absurd. i am not spanish or french guy. you got that! i am engish. i am live in america. what if you are america deaf guy and what you will say about yourself? huh mmm let me kow. thanks! here is my e=mail is crs1935@yahoo.com
5,Why had no one ever told me this before?!!!,"For 15 years, I asked health care professionals, Why have I lost my interst in sex? Why do I love my husband as much as I do and yet increasingly fear intimacy with him? What's WRONG with ME?!! Until I read this book no one could give me the answers to questions I had given up asking. Dr. Zolbrod's one-on-one writing style and brief case studies helped me to see how much my parents attitude about their and my sexuality influenced me more the older I got and the longer I was married. The information within this book brought a level of understanding and new lines of communication my husband and I never had before. I have never been so grateful to find and read a book, and yes--this book changed my life."
2,sexsmart,bought this book hoping it would address anxiety and focusing to achieve orgasm. i did not relate to it as much as i had hoped
5,Handy,"I'm a CNC machinist in a custom fabrication shop, I use this shim stock a lot. I would recommend it"
3,"A decent a achievement, just not for me","I discovered Ross Campbell's artwork with the relaunch of Glory from Image Comics (a fantastic book). I ordered this with great anticipation and was really let down. The artwork is fantastic but the story is... non-existent. Since I am not a 20-ish girl, I had no chance of identifying with the characters in this slice of life book. If you are a young lady, you may very well enjoy this, but being a 30-something male, there is nothing here for me. No disrespect meant to Mr. Campbell, just ask yourself if you fall within the book's intended demographic before you buy."
1,Cheap Rip-Off,"Okay, so I am 27 years old, and have a 25 year old brother, we are well schooled on hotwheels, heck my mom has even saved the old hotwheels city suitcase sets, so I am strictly an old-school hotwheel girl. Spider Slam is BOGUS!!!!!! Okay, after you spend a million hours putting it together you sent a car down it...THEN IT FALLS APART. Try all of this happening with your 3 year old at yoour feet. Yeah, you get my point. We have a million hotwheels toys and all of them are poo. BIG PIECES OF POO! What's up with Hotwheels, have they totally forgotten the late 70's and early 80's. Spider Slam is no fun and it is sitting in my laundry room banished next to the Tiki TORTURE (opps, TORCHER)that the darn thing is supposed to hook up to, by the way IT DOES NOT."
1,another cheaply made hot wheel product,I have been disappointed with these sets each time but my son received this as a gift so we opened the box and set it up. As usual with these hot wheels sets it is poorly construced to say the least. Just go get the plain tracks with the little plastic connecters. My sons love those.
5,Best set of DVD's ever!,My daughters and I are loving watching all of the episodes of this wonderful series. We love all of the little extras that go along with it and the case makes it easy to take on trips.
3,Unpllayable disks,"The packaging makes absolutely no sense. I wonder who put it together because it really doesn't line up with the show at all. That really is a tiny problem compared to the fact that at least four disks are entirely unplayable. Disk 24, 39, and 42 are all completely unplayable at this point which is really upsetting me because after spending a significant chunk of money on the set I am unable to use the product.Upsetting.-Strange packaging-SOME OF THE DVDs DON'T EVEN PLAY"
5,Sparkling and Youthful Series,"My 15 year old daughter and I adore the Barbie Doll packaging and the photo filled episode guide, along with the cute Gilmorisms handbook. This is such a sparkling and youthful series that we both love!As soon as it arrived in the mail, we treated ourselves to a marathon of episodes, beginning with the pilot that we'd never seen.There aren't many shows as endearing and witty. It's a keeper and definitely a not-to-miss DVD set for mother-daughter bonding.It's especially suited for those popcorn and soda slumber party Saturday nights. Moms and daughters, don't miss out!!!"
3,"good show, but defective discs","I like the show and have always been a fan, but this box set was somewhat disappointing. The case and episode guides are flimsy [they came apart after a few weeks], and several of the discs stopped working after being viewed only once. I never returned them because I thought I had done something wrong; however, based on other reviews, it seems as if the discs themselves are defective."
5,"Great Product, Great Price","For anyone who loves Gilmore Girls, this collection is a must. I snagged it at a great price, so it was extra great!It comes with a book of Gilmore-isms and a second book that is a complete breakdown of every episode and seasons."
5,Great gift for a teenager!,Birthday gift for my 14 year old. She loves the set. Packaging is great with convenient way to store.
5,Love love love it!,"Great all the DVDs in one box great guide, and a lot better than buying each season seperate. I love Girlmore Girls and now i can watch it straight through whenever i want, without commercials!"
5,Brilliant Box Set,"When I ordered this boxset I was a bit worried since so many people have been complaining about the format and the look of it. However, I really like the way it has been done. It has been done in good quality and so I don't understand what all the fuss is about!I'm really happy with the boxset, now I can finally see all the seasons that haven't been aired over here in the UK. On another note, I'm really surprised at how quick shipping was!So for all of you a bit worried about the quality and price, I wouldn't be since it is definitely a substantial boxset and of good quality! Plus you get all the seasons in a nice padded box!"
2,Gilmore Cirls DVD set,"The set is complete, but the color seems to be washed out We have not run every DVD yet, but all the ones we have run seem faded."
3,Way over the top silly at times . .,"I DO like this series and have watched it numerous times, but honestly - the dialog of Lauren Graham! It's just SO stupidly silly at times - you can even somewhat tell in the other actor's faces how moronic it is. No person (especially a 'business' person) would act like this! The mother/daughter connection is sweet however. A little of this nonsense goes a long, LONG way! If it wasn't for Edward Herrmann and Kelly Bishop in the cast, I doubt I would have watched much."
4,Disappointed with Amazon,"Obviously love the series. However, I bought it off of Amazon and there is a problem with one of the discs that has yet to be rectified. I spoke with Amazon's customer service and though the man I spoke to was nice, he had little information and could not offer me a definite solution. This is quite disappointing considering what a huge company Amazon is. I am STILL waiting for them to fix this issue."
1,Mrs.,I was told that this item was new. It was not. It had been used. When I put in the first disc it was dirty and had to be cleaned to work. Another disc had two skips in it. the casing was dirty and worn. I returned it for a full refund.
2,overpriced,I am very disappointed to learn this item can be purchased for a lot less money at Target and Walmart.
1,never received this product and after purchase someone attempted to steal my credit info,"This item was never received and despite attempts, never had a reply made by snowball express nor ever provided a tracking number. I thank AMAZON for righting the purchase. Shortly after this was purchased some one attempted to bill a skype account and attempt to send money to a charity in Canada on my credit card. Though I can't prove a connection, would be very wary."
1,"absolutely terrible, products AND show","dont watch this crap! gawd wants us to believe in him! and if you dont believe in gawd you hate him and you love all evil!! if you watch this evil, terrible show then you are the DEVIL! and you support the devil and all who love him! save yourself from this garbage show and all the garbage that goes with it!! if you dont stop, i will make you stop in the name of GAWD!!!!! PRAISE LORD JESUS LORD HAVE MERCY ON THESE POOR CHILDRENS' SOULS!!!!! HELP THEE CHRIST, FOR THEY KNOW NOT WHAT THEY DO!"
2,Gilmore Girls cd collection,"The content of Gilmore Girls was wonderful, however the technical/mechanical value was underwhelming to say the least. Several of the cdroms skipped during Play. It was very disheartening to be watching and have the cdrom skip during the show(s)."
2,A dubbed version from China,"This was obviously not original material as the picture was grainy and the sound quality was bad. This dubbed version was shipped to me from China and some of the discs had errors (locking up, skipping ahead, etc). Luckily it is not crucial for the subject matter to have high quality picture and sound...it is The Gilmore Girls, after all, and not a high tech, special effects action movie. My wife was satisfied but not over-joyed."
5,Perfect gift for my Gilmore-addicted daughter,"A little pricey, yes, but she loves it. The packaging is really fun. A grab-and-go if she wanted to take it to an overnight with friends. Good, wholesome entertainment. Worth the money!"
3,Low Quality Product,"I absolutely loved this show, and was really excited to be able to watch it anytime I wanted. When I got it, I was living in a city where I barely knew any one, so it was something I was looking forward to doing when I got bored. But I ended up being really disappointed by the quality of the set. It was shipped slightly damaged. It was obvious it was a wholesale deal because someone made too many. The packaging wasn't nearly as nice as other box sets. And about one disk from each season wouldn't work on any DVD player I could find. I would have been better off following the review I'd seen here and buying the set season by season. It was really upsetting when I knew the next episode was one I hadn't seen on tv and when I put the disk in, it wouldn't play. This is probably a repeat of other reviews here, but be warned. Many of these sets are flawed."
3,"Love the series, problems with the set...","Overall I like this box set. I love this show and love watching it. However, I was sad to find out that season 7 has some glitchy DVDs that still play but have flashy parts and other weirdness. Another downside was that disc 24 (disc 6 of season 4) didn't play, at all. I had to get a replacement disc from Ebay and it was 6 dollars. The set is nice, but I think it is horrid that the discs would have any problems with them. I didn't purchase this item from Amazon, but I thought that others might want to know before they buy. The set is cool, but glitchy discs are annoying. If you have the separate seasons, just keep those."
4,Hard to get.,"It was a great deal, couldn't find it any place cheaper, if you could find it at all. It came way quicker then most places that mail you thing too."
4,I love everything about this show...except for that logan character..,"The box set itself is pretty cool. The booklets & all the pictures are awesome. The show itself kind of dies down after season 5, & season 7 is definitely dull, & full of scenarios that were already seen throughout the rest of the series. And the worst part of the show: Logan! I do not like the character, the drama he brings, nor the actor who plays him."
5,Gilmore Girls The Complete Series Collection,"I too was alittle upset when this set first came out. I mean the timing was just wrong. I too had been one of those fans that bought each individual box set. Well I went ahead and purchased this as well and it's great!!!! I don't ever plan on selling off my individual sets, I think any true Gilmore Girls fan needs both!! :) It's a wonderful set and yes it's alittle cheesy but Lorelai and Rory would have loved it and probably owned it as well."
5,Gilmore Girls -The Complete Series Collection,"This is a great series! I bought it for my 16yo and we watch one or two episodes nearly every day! The bonus scenes are fun, the packaging is fantastic, very handy. Plus the episode guide is like a crash course in Pop Culture. Highly recommended -you will not be disappointed!"
5,Gilmore Girls series collection,Our son does not watch any tv- he just collects dvd's and watches tv series and movies. He loved the gift .
5,Gilmore Girls: The Complete Series Collection,"I love this show, I got this box set for my sister for Christmas (early...). I can't wait for Christmas so we can break it open. Comes in the cool box like the picture and everything!"
4,"Great Seller, prompt shipping!","This seller was great to deal with received the video set as promised, new, factory sealed, and received the item within just a few days. No drama. Will definitely buy from this seller again. Thank You!!!"
5,Truly delightful,"Love the Barbie case, love the episode guide, love the neat storage format, love it all! It's amazing to see how much of the show has been cut from the ABC Family Channel re-runs, and no commercials is a blissful bonus."
1,"Great show, but AVOID THIS BOX SET AT ALL COSTS","I bought this and this is NOT problem free. Some discs didn't play, some episodes have no visuals and/or sound for the first 20 minutes. Such a poor product for a great show.Most problematic are seasons 4 and 5. Of course by the time you get to that point, you can't exchange anything from amazon (unless you are watching 5 episodes a day!), and are left trying to contact the manufacturers direct.Had to watch missed episodes on-line, and buy the individual season in one case to compliment this poorly devised set. Clearly no-one quality checks."
1,DVD 24 doesn't work,"The set arrived in good condition and is pretty much what I expected.As other customers said : it is pretty big, and the DVDs are in cardboard pockets.I liked the episode guide and the book of gilmorisms.However, disc number 24 (season 4 last 4 episodes) doesn't work.Apparently Amazon is aware of the problem since some customers received a replacement disc. But, for an unknown reason, I cannot benefit from this replacement disc.I have been exchanging e-mails with the customer service for 3 days now and I am not any closer to being able to watch the missing episodes.I am pretty dispointed in my purchase since the reason I buy complete series boxed set is to be able to watch ALL the episodes, and not miss a season ending."
2,One disc was scratched,The entire collection came in good condition besides one disc which was unplayable so that was disappointing. Other than that everything else was fine. I do not recommend this product if you want your collection to be complete.
5,Wife Loves It,I bought this as a Valentines Day gift for my wife.I think I just scored big brownie points for this.It's a nice package as well.
4,Chick Flick Drama/Comedy,I found it to be Lite hearted. An entertaining lite drama with lots of funny scenes. Once you start you won't want to stop until you've seen the whole series - it gets you in !
5,Fantastic!!!!!,"Absoulutley a great series. Love it!!! It is a great bond between mother and daughter. It's uplifting. I love how each charactor talks in there conversations, fast and funny. Its not just a show for women, its a show for everyone."
1,Missing one of the disks,The item was a Christmas gift and was unfortunately missing the 5th disk of the first season. I would like to exchange it for a complete series.
4,Malfunction problems,"I love the actual product, but several of my disks skipped and i don't want to pay shipping. this was expensive enough i don't want to pay more because it doesnt' work."
5,Gilmore Girls collection,"I really enjoyed the Gilmore Girl's collection. Not only do you get all 42 discs with special features, but you get a book with summaries of each episode and a book with all the words and sayings that the characters use in the shows with explanations, especially for the young viewers that never lived through some of the eras they mention. At my age I tend to understand the majority of the references made by the characters, especially Lorelai and Rory. I have enjoyed many gilmore girl marathon weekends since my purchase. I don't have to get home at 5pm to watch it on TV. I can watch it at any hour on any day."
2,Gilmore Girls: The Complete Series Collection,"My order came faster than expected and that was nice. However, after viewing several of the dvd's, there are skips in some of them. This was disappointing because they were advertised as good as new. I don't think I would order from this person again."
4,Greatest series of All Time,"Excellent series, in my opinion, good acting and very well written. Very intellegent series. You won't find a smarter, wittier series, anywhere. Very fast and sometimes hard to keep up with, but it makes your conversations longer and smarter in everyday life. It's what makes the show great. Well worth the money, however the ending isn't really surperb. Hopefully they will make a movie to end the show right."
5,Gilmore Girls Rock,I have to admit this set is awesome! They have like 6 DVDs per season I think and two books that are slam packed with info. One book is has all of the GG's -isms. The intelligence of the writers is shown throughout the books.
1,Sad.,"I love the Gilmore Girls and I was so excited to get these DVDs. I ordered them in late January and it is now May. I had worked my way through seasons 1-3 and was about to watch the last disk in season 4. I put the disk in only to find that disk 24 is the same as disk 23. My very favorite episode, the one where Liz gets married was supposed to be on that disk. What do I do now? It is too late to return."
2,Gilmore Girls Series - Not so complete after all,"I recently bought the complete series of the Gilmore Girls for my wife, which she really liked except that some of the DVDs refuse to play despite our best efforts. A more thorough quality check was probably needed."
4,OMG Its The Gilmore Gurlsss,"OMG I cant believe I finally mowed enough lawns to buy the Gilmore Girls complete series!!!! I started watching when Gilmore Girls premiered in 2001, I was 4!!! OMG from the beginning I had a massive crush on Alexis Bledel, she is SUCH a mega hottie. I got so jealous when she would hang around Miss Patty, Alexis was mine. I haven't gotten to watch this box set yet, I duck taped it to my ceiling so I could stare at it as I fall asleep. I bought each season individually as well. I must say the box set dissapoints me, it does not stand up to saliva at all! Rory's face is now just a wet smudge. Now I'll do Pros and ConsPros; ALEXIS BLEDELRORYTHE MAIN CHARACTERTHE YOUNGEST GILMORE GIRLRORY'S OLDER SISTERS' SISTERCons; Poor QualityFell on my face from above, doesn't resist gravityMiss Patty gettin all up in my woman!"
3,This one`s for nostalgia,"I looked for this music for 15 years before I moved to NY and found it in an obscure import shop.It`s not great.The movie certainly wasn't great either.But if you saw it when you were just a kid like I was,it was affecting.Ennio Morricone,now world renowned composer,was just branching out of his western scores,and this was one the earliest.The Orca theme itself is very haunting,with rich string arrangements.The near falsetto of ""Dialogue of the memories"" is very sad and moving..and short.The rest...well...it aint so hot.But if youre like me,(are you like me-charming and suave?),you`ll want to capture some of those precious childhood moments with this music.Free Willy aint gonna do it."
1,Boring,"The marketing of this movie was very clever - I bought it. It's the worst movie I've ever seen. It is unprofessional, very long and boring and not worth paying for the partial nude shots (no talent necessary). If this quality of film was created by 13 yr old film students, at least it would be understandable. One actor did a good job, the rest were really bad. I fast forwarded several scences because I couldn't stand the torture and still have not sat through the whole thing - I've got better things to do."
3,funny Stuff,"Friend of mine had a copy, looked interesting.Got to say, who are the people bashing this film? I laughed. I mean get real... this is an Independent film The storyline made for some crazy situations. Looks like onece again ""the 5% club"" that didn't get or appreciate the experience rule the reviews. I watch alot of films and this one is being bashed way too harsh. As for funny man Rodney D....he's not the only one having trouble getting a little respect ;)"
3,UnHollywood Film,"Wow, somebody must have personally upset the guy who rated this a 1-star that or he had unrealistic expectations. If you like Indie films that are dialogue-driven, this one is kind of neat. The story starts off a little slow but as the pieces come together the pacing is pretty good. I saw the film as a buddy of mine is in it as well. I have to say, I think they did a pretty good job. If you thought the dialogue in 'clerks' was unrealistic then the same goes here. If you like 'rough' low budget films or foreign films, I think you'd like this one. The people are 'real' looking and not hollywood supermodels. I guess I followed the film more than the last guy because I figured out that the pregnancy test was way later than a day.The thing I liked most was the animation that sets up the story.It's a little different, the characters are bigger than life. I laughed and I bought a copy. Indie film is where it begins for these guys. It's not a 5-star flick but I liked it."
4,"Great indie flick reminiscent of ""Clerks""","Overall, Gordon's a slick indie movie that's well-written and well-crafted. You have to keep in mind that the characters are purposely trite and stereotypical -- very much like the characters in ""Clerks"" -- so don't expect too much depth in that area.The soundtrack is brilliant, so be sure to pick it up in addition to the DVD."
3,Dull with a dash of boring,"2.5 stars. I gave up on this movie the first time, but then a friend told me that I needed to stay with it because it got better. She lied. I didn't find anything about this movie either thrilling or suspenseful. The ending was a little too pact and yet again in a George Clooney movie ( ex. Syriana) I never come to care about the characters. Well, maybe poor Arthur. Clooney does turn in an average performance, but the movie is dull regardless."
1,Not Sure What Happened,"Not sure what happened but the movie doesn't work in my DVD player or my personal DVD player. I would be willing to give this seller another chance - it's probably just defective. However, I wasn't able to view the movie due to it being defective - sorry I cannot give a review of the movie at this time."
4,Good entertainment,Great movie to have an entertain time. One of the best actions movies I saw lately.
2,"tedious, boring, pisspoor storytelling...","tedious, boring, pisspoor storytelling...what a CHORE to watch this thing. No suspense, just confusing subplots and tedious talking talking talking. Man, this thing is in need of some major script overhaul and editing.Most of the time I was completely baffled as to what was going on, and desperately trying to even CARE enough to continue watching.I couldn't even summon any emotion about any of the characters....I didn't like or dislike them, they were just.... THERE.Films like this make me angry for the time they stole from me. I could've been doing something more interesting and satisfying instead....like scratching my nuts."
4,Michael Clayton,"I am happy that I received the item shortly after I had ordered, and that I received notification that the shipment was made."
2,not very interesting,"This isn't one of George Clooney's better movies. Right from the beginning the movie demands a LOT of your attention, or you will end up very confused in a matter of 5 minutes. The suspense or mystery wasn't really intriguing to me, and the only part that really interested me was when George's character pulled over to some field, seen some unusually quiet horses, then his car blew up behind him, shocking him badly (and shocking the viewers too- didn't see THAT coming!)After that scene, you really need to pay close attention to everything else to understand what's going on."
2,Failed the bar!,"I don't know what all the hubbub was about. A talented corporate lawyer, played by Tom Wilkinson, temporarily looses his scruples and jeopardizes his high-powered firms future. Corporate problem solver and fixer Michael Clayton, played by George Clooney, is called in to fix the mess. I would think the life of a corporate fixer would be a powerful, intriguing, exciting and completely satisfying job. Unfortunately, there are so many messes throughout the movie that it never quite comes together. Of course, Clooneys character is a mess. He and his brother have gambling problems, and he's a divorced part-time father, with no money. WHAT? In the end, this movie is long, aimless and a bit pointless; unless you're a corporate lawyer I suppose. I'm a Clooney and Pollack fan, but I have to give this movie a failing grade for its lackluster delivery."
3,Good but not completely awesome.,"It was a pretty good show, but I didn't absolutely love it. For some reason I find it a tad bit difficult to sympathize with high-power attorneys who have emotional problems."
5,One of George Clooney's better performances,"""Michael Clayton"" is a very good movie if you like movies that keep you guessing. Many twists and turns but very well done. Never quite certain who the ""bad guy"" is until nearing the end. Even at the very last moment when ""Michael Clayton"" is bargaining with the female corporate head, you think you know what is about to happen and it takes one last twist. It seems to have it all...suspense, intrigue, action and some comedy...but comedy was more for relief. It's worth watching and since I own it, I will gladly be watching ""Michael Clayton"" again and again. Very Good!!"
3,Some unrealized potential but certainly watchable,"Okay, here's what I would have done with the film:1. I would have made the problem with U North clear and a bit more direct so it would have more of an impact on the viewer;2. remove part of the beginning which actually shows much of the ending. This device works well in some films, but not so much in this one.3. perhaps spent less time or no time at all on Clayton's son and brother; their side stories don't have all that much relevance and take up time unnecessarily.Otherwise, this is a solid legal thriller, with Clooney and, in particular, Tom Wilkinson giving some great performances amidst all the intrigue. The scenes of Wilkinson being ambushed and drugged, and those showing Clooney being pursued and nearly blown up are quite harrowing. Producer and director Sydney Pollack has become an excellent actor in his own right, as well."
4,Top-notch acting in the service of an improbable story,"A Hollywood thriller in which the villains work for a BIG EVIL CORPORATION that is POISONING PEOPLE and trying to COVER IT UP. How original .... not! The acting in this movie is first-rate, but the plot is so wheezy that it's hard to take it all very seriously. And on at least one occasion, Clayton is saved from peril by what appears to be an arbitrary and unexplained decision: ""Gosh, I think I'll get out of my car and go commune with those horses."" Clooney, Wilkinson and Swinton do a fine job of holding your interest and making their characters believable, but the heavy-handed and preachy script keeps intruding. Worth watching, but no landmark."
3,A Big Disappointment,"This movie is cryptic, confusing and almost unwatchable. The plot line is inane and feeds upon long-outdated stereotypes in the John Grisham mode of corporate greed, corrupt lawyers, hit-men and coverups of massive scandals. All this is topped by weak performances. Tilda Swinton won an academy award for -- what? I am sure no one was more surprised than she was when she got it.Put this one right up there with Syriana for boring, confusing and never-to-be-watched-a-2nd-time. What's the point? If you are into George Clooney, lawyer-bashing or (especially) both, then you might find this interesting. But you still have to wade through the confusion and inane plot with a non-ending conclusion."
3,Another classic Clooney effort,A truly enjoyable film where good triumphs over evil. Clooney is one of the great masters of his craft in our time.
4,Good movie!,"Clooney does a nice job. One of his better fliks. Good casting, good story. I recommend this movie. Worth viewing."
4,Enjoyed it,"I really liked this movie. It was a little difficult to understand what was going on at first, but it moved quickly and I enjoyed all the actors in it. It kpet my attention and I have a short attention span. I especially loved the ending."
2,Laborious,"I am beginning to think that Clooney is so popular that anything he makes will be critically acclaimed. Unfortunately, in this case, the movie is just too slow, with too little happening to keep the audience interested. Yes, Clooney gives a solid, but one dimensional performance. If you love Clooney, watch it, if you do not, save yourself the time."
