3,Good,"The book was good, but started out slow with too much explaining about nothing. A lot could have been eleminated. I felt that there was not enough mentioned at the end when the pilots wife went on her quest."
2,"A Breezy Read, But Kind of Disappointing","Did anyone else finish this book and realize that you never really get a sense of ""Kathryn"" the person? I found the character development shallow; consequently it was hard to get really involved with the story. Also, it got a little predictable toward the end."
1,dissapointing,I kept waiting for something to happen but nothing materlized. It was very flat and repeptitive. I will not read another Oprah's pick again because this is the second dissapointing book I have read that is on her recommended reading.
2,"Easy to read, but very predictable and disappointing.","It was simply a formulation of words, not requiring any creativity. The plot twists were merely spice for a story that anybody in the airline industry could tell. It held my interest to the end, but was stereotypical and extremely disappointing."
3,Interesting Insight,"I watched Oprah's small ""play"" based on part of the book & was intrigued. Even though I knew what was going to happen, I read the book anyway. I enjoyed watching how the story evolved and how the characters handled the situation. I was a bit disappointed in what caused the crash, thinking it was a bit far-fetched. Not that it couldn't happen, but the author seemed to lead you in one direction, finding that you should've gone the other way. I was a bit confused by the cursory ending & would've liked a bit more detail. Overall, it is a book I would recommend. Relatively light reading and an interesting plot. An unusal Oprah pick, I think because of it's straightforward writing. None of the long descriptions and details from the usual picks."
3,Read Shreve's other books,"The Weight of Water and Resistance were both dazzling books. It's too bad Oprah chose this lesser effort by this accomplished author. Not a bad book, but her others were more original and interesting."
2,The ending left you feeling confused,This book is not up to Oprah's usual good books. I am still confused with the ending. It certainly did not make me question my husband.
1,Figured it out by just reading 30 pages - waste of time and,Too easy to figure out and should've been a short story. I respect Oprah's choices but this has been disappointing.
1,Just mediocre reading,This book did not make me want to find out what was going to happen. It really was not that interesting.
3,"Very Predictable, Easy Read","This book was very, very predictable and cliche. I really didn't get into it until the end. If you are not familiar with the background of the Irish struggles you may have a hard time understanding."
1,My Review,"I found this book to very slow and uninteresting! I have read my of Opera's Book Club Books that I really enjoyed, but I do not recommend this one. I never made it past page 100 of this novel, so please don't waste your money and time!"
2,Depressing,"I was very disappointed. The beginning dragged too long, and when things finally start getting interesting when his other life becomes clear, its over, and those parts are not explored at all."
1,Don't bother,"A friend gave me this book, upon throwing it away. Now I know why. The writing is average; and the subject matter is too ""womanly."" I'm not knocking books about women by women, but this ain't no ""God of Small Things"" by Arundhati Roy. There is something very tedious about the protagonist in this book. One reviewer said this book was like a movie off of Lifetime. That can't be good. Another reviewer said that the most interesting character in this book is the husband, and he's dead! I nearly fell off my chair laughing!"
2,Great book after you get past the first 200 pages,"I found the first two hundred pages a bit tedious. Reading reviews, I knew it was about a shocking secret life and the journey of a woman to find out who her husband really was... Only the first two thirds of the book was all about the grieving process of loosing a husband and father. For me, I was waiting for the ""good stuff"". The story did take a good turn when we got to the last third of the book, keeping me on the edge of my seat to find out what would happen next. But I wanted to find out more of what made the husband tick... There were too many questions left unanswered, and perhaps that is the point of the story - we really don't know Jack Lyons. While that may be an interesting premise, it makes for a lousy novel.And I have no idea what was up with the ending... total disappointment - the ending alone makes it not worth reading.This could have been a great book - but instead was only mediocre."
1,Disappointing,"This novel was disappointing at best. As a ""real"" pilot's wife, I found the plot to be far-fetched.The affair with the flight attendant and subsequent marriage was especially predictable. Come on, Ms. Shreve, you can be more original than that!"
2,Somewhat disappointing,"I was surprised this was a choice for Oprah's Book Club. I have read some of her other recommendations and been completely entertained. I expected the same with The Pilot's Wife.I felt the characters should have been more developed. Kathryn's husband has been married for five years to another woman and she didn't have a clue? Didn't she ever need to call him at the crew apartment before? Whatever happened to a woman's intuition? It was a little frustrating to follow the plot from past to present, but the most frustrating for me was the ending. Did I miss something?I did read it in two days because I kept thinking it would get better, but it didn't. I would give the author another chance however. Not every literary attempt can be a huge success."
1,Waste of time and money,"I only bought this because the plot sounded interesting, however once I started it I had a hard time sticking with it. It was unbelievably slow and boring! I was so annoyed at wasting my money on it! I usually devour my books and reread them over the years. This book became my ""in the bathroom"" book and after I was done I immediately got rid of it."
1,Waiting for the heart stopping plot twist....it never came.,"This was not what I expected. Characters were not developed, description of the emotions too ""bubble-gum"", the whole middle could heve been left out and you would have had the story anyway. Perhaps if they make a movie out of this, it could be doctored up to be SOMETHING like the ""Horse Whisperer"" was. Should have bought Memoirs of a Geisha."
3,It's a Page Turner.,"What a great suspense. I finished the book almost immediately after I started it. It made me want to become part of Oprah's book club! (When it came to the Climax though, I was actually a little disappointed because you just know what's going on and you're built up to think it's more) but IT'S STILL A GREAT BOOK. Everytime the author would flashback to the past, I was like ""no no go back to the present, I need to know what happens!"""
3,The Pilot's Wife,"While this was a really good, and fast, read, I thought the ending was a little weak. Everything was tied up in neat little bows and that isn't realistic. The husband's contradictions were too far apart in places to be believable. Also, the wife appeared to be devoid of any responsbility for the situation she and her husband wound up in."
1,YAWN...............,"I have to agree with many reviewers who ask...""How did this come to be an Oprah book?"" It read like a boring afternoon soap opera. I guessed every step of the way...not really caring about these flat underdeveloped characters. When I was finished, my first question was ""Was it REALLY possible that with ALL the authorities from many organizations working on the case (going through his belongings AND seizing his computer?)....the Pilots Wife unravels it all herself first? AND...after the short period from the time of the tragedy to the completion of the book...the author found that to be enough time to end the book with Kathryn actually caring about Muire's children? MAYBE in time...but c'mon! Gee...No stages of mourning for this wife, huh?"
2,Oh! so true,"Began the book by not even reading the back cover but just guessed that he had someone else. Ofcourse I am not saying that all pilots are leading such a double life but when MEN have the type of jobs which take them away, are difficult to contact,(now mobile phones help!) then the chances and opportunites are all there. I could not put the book down and when the ending began to unfold what a great twist. I am looking forward to reading some of her other books."
2,What hype,Give us a break. A good writer turned to pulp fiction. With glaring errors that leave one stunned and cheated.
1,Distressing book with odd plot twists,"This book is not poorly written. I read it in one weekend, and did not want to stop, but I did not like it at all. It was disturbing what horrible things The Pilot of the title did and hid. The final explanation of what motivated all his actions seemed very far-fetched and not well-explained at all. This is the only book I have read by Anita Shreve, and suspect she is a talented writer from what I saw in this book, but the story itself was too disturbing for me to enjoy. I also lost some respect when I read the official press release sent to me about the book and noticed two typos."
1,Dissapointed,This is the last time I ever purchase a book without reading the first few pages...Extremely predictable plot with the auther stretching out the story with inane fillers.
3,Maintained a Steady Pace All the Way Through,"This is the first of Anita Shrive's books I have read. Although the book wasn't exactly riveting, I read the whole thing in almost one sitting. The characters were easy to understand, and there weren't so many characters that you forgot who was who. The book was an easy read, and had just enough steam to it to keep me wondering what would happen next and how things would unfold. I was disappointed in the ending--feeling as though I had been left hanging with some loose ends that should have been tied up."
2,"Well-written, but very predictable","I concede from the start that Ms. Shreve is a talented author. In this book, she very subtly paints a portrait of a woman living an ""ordinary"" life in what she believes is a good marriage. This depiction is thoroughly convincing as are the New England setting and the supporting characters. Unfortunately, she saddles us with an extremely predictable plot and the book grinds forward until every foretold event unfolds. A few ""twists"" are thrown in near the climax but there is no real depth or emotion to any of it. At the very end, when something new and creative would be required to hold the reader's interest, the story abruptly stops. My impression is that this could be, with editing, the first third of a great book. While it is a disappointing read, I'd certainly try another of Ms. Shreve's books."
4,"Immediately engaging, fast paced and well written","From the first page I was hooked. The story takes a lot of unexpected twists and turns. The characters are well developed and believeable. While I was not disappointed with the ending I would have liked to know a little more about why Jack did what he did. This is a great, quick read."
4,a story that forces you to reexamine your relationships,Ms Shreve certainly knows how to touch on all of the silent terrors every pilot's spouse dwells on alone at 3:00am. She then twists the knife in the already open wound when she examines how much blind faith there must be in relationships where people spend time apart. A gripping premise though not coupled with as deserving a conclusion.
2,disappointing.... predictable,"I was disappointed by this book, the first I read by Anita Shreve. It was not gripping or really very interesting. I kept reading thinking it would get better, but it didn't."
2,Not compelling enough,"The idea for this book is excellent; a woman lives a life of wedded bliss until her husband dies under suspicious circumstances and she finds out the secrets that he kept from her.However, I did not feel the emotion that could have been there. My connection to the main character was not strong and her story did not make a lasting impression on me.We used this book for a girls-only book club selection and had some great off-shoot discussions about the topic but not particularly the book."
2,Less than mediocre due to a slow and predictable tale.,"The book progresses slowly to a predictable end. Even the ""twist"" that the author adds at the end comes across as a last desperate effort to make the reader feel that they didn't waste their time. It is awkward and unsatisfying."
3,"Quick, fluid, a bit contrived","I read this book before it became an Oprah book, and I confess I'm surprised... it is well-written, but it's somewhat unbelievable and contrived, and doesn't really stay with you... But Ms. Shreve is a good and deserving writer and I hope the fame and glory won't spoil her for the next one... check out her other books."
2,Book was a disappointing read with unbelievable plot line.,"The Pilot's Wife is a frustrating read in that the main character, Kathryn is out of control in her own home from the first page. I am surprised that Oprah chose a book about a woman who is a victim, opening the door of her home to a stranger and allowing him to take over her life without asking important questions. Mostly the questions weren't asked so that manipulation of the reader and the suspense could continue to the last 75 pages of the book. Who could relate to a woman without a clue? This book is just not believable. I also resented the comment from the main character,a high school music teacher, that the best thing about a small school was the shortness of the awards assembly."
4,A quick read that makes you wonder,After I saw Oprah rave about this book and ask the question 'How well do you know your husband' I had to read this. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and I feel like she was a girlfriend telling me what has happened in her life. I gave it to a friend who couldn't put it down. I look forward to reading more from this author.
4,A great quick read,"I really enjoyed this book. I do a lot of reading, mostly on the train during a long commute. I loved the story, it never got dull, and I never wanted to put it down. I was shocked to see the other negative reviews unless people are expecting great literary works of art. This is a simple story, but well written, with a conclusion that isn't disappointing. I took off one star since it is a fairly simple story without deep meaning, but well worth your time."
3,The Pilot's Wife,"I think I have officially given up on ""The Book Club"". This isn't my first disappointment. It isn't that the book was poorly written, it is just a bit overdone. Too much 'fluff'. The books' ending was a disappointment, and you had to wait until nearly 3/4 of the way through to get to actual story, to actual movement. Most married women, I feel, do not find interest nor comfort in a book about cheating husbands. Stories are supposed to capture you and let your imagination roam; who wants to roam into a story that leaves you depressed? ..."
1,Simple book,"Simple book for the simple minded, pass on this. Trust me, go get another Oprah book if you have to."
1,Hannah HighSchool could have done better.,"If this is an example of Anita Shreve's writing, it'll be the only book of hers I'll ever read. Really dumb character development."
4,Gripping and captivating. Shreve never lost my attention.,"From the very first page I was captivated by Shreve and her ability to spin a great tale. I only wish it was a longer book, because I read it too fast!"
3,An enjoyable and quick read,"This was not great literature. There were passages that actually seemed silly-- a 15 year old girl telling her mother about sex in the animal kingdom as a lead-in to her own revelation of having ""done it,"" for example. On the other hand, I was so interested in reading the next page that I finished the book the same day I started reading. It won't change your life of make you reflect too much, but you'll enjoy it at least as much as any episode of ER."
4,Enjoyable Reading,I really enjoyed reading The Pilot's Wife. It was a quick read (I finished within 24 hours) but it always had me thinking. There were a few different twists and unexpected turns that kept it interesting. I also enjoyed the Irish element. Worth purchasing and reading.
3,Been there. Done that.,"Of the two popular novels about pilots and their women this summer, Rustad's ""The Triumph and the Glory"" is a runaway winner. ""The Pilot's Wife"" is a flawed, over-hyped novel, based upon a worn out premise and littered wioth loose ends all over the place. Anita Shreve is capable of far better than this!"
2,Interesting and Emotional,"This novel explores the many stages of grief, from shock and horror to acceptance. Kathryn's character development is somewhat weak throughout the book -- I wanted her to triumph over adversity or at least begin a believable road to recovery. The ending was a let down. On a positive note, the story was intriquing, in an ""emotional-rollercoaster"" kind of way. I wouldn't bring this to a book club, if you want to keep your friends."
4,"Compelling, Fast Read!!!","I thought that this book was a very enjoyable read. I found that there was something about it that pulled me right along. The author dances to the edge of the absurd, but somehow she pulls it all together. It worked for me!"
1,What a waste of time,"Unfortunately, once I start reading a book, I am committed to finish it. I found this book to be shallow, very one-dimensional with a plot that is too predictable. The plot does not expand beyond the main character's anguish. A dozen or so pages before the book ends, I was teased with some intrigue, then the plot slides back to the same morose track. It could have been a thought provoking book, but instead it lead me down a one way street that didn't go anywhere. By the time I finished reading the book, I was angry. Angry that I had to read the whole thing. The gutt-wrenching emotions that readers witness throughout the book is very real, but the unravelled ""secrets"" in the plot are cheesy at best. What a shame."
2,It could have been better,"I really got into the book at the beginning but then it just seemed to drag on and on and on.... etc.Then to read the hole book and not like the ending just disappointed me. It was very predictable. I did like the plot of the book though, but felt it could have been better."
3,Very over-rated book,"Disappointing. After all of the Oprah hoopla I thought thisbook would be a great purchase. It wasn't, it was just average stuff. At least I ordered it along with the Harry Potter books for my 12 year old and The Triumph and Glory, which my dad bragged up, and they were all very good. You win some and you lose some. The Pilot's Wife was just too much of a chick book for me to get into I guess."
2,slow going from the beginning--but got better toward the end,"Very dull & boring from the beginning, from the previous reviews I read I really thought it was going to be a good book. I was very disappointed Actually the last half of the book was good. (two last words) dry & blah!"
4,A read until it's read book,"This is the best book I've read in ages and I'll definitely be reading Anita Shreve's others. In addition to skillful handling of grief, it brings up the scary idea that we don't know the person we know best as well as we thought we did. Shreve is excellent at dropping hints that you don't notice until later--the marble bench in the garden that makes no splash in your consciousness until it turns out to be an altar, Jack being good at surprises (buying the house). It you really want to see how well this subject is handled, watch the movie Random Hearts. Spouses dying in plane crash leads to discovery of affair. Wife wants to forget the whole thing; husband wants to be angry. Lasts over 2 hours."
3,I thought the book had a great starting.....,I thought the book had a great starting but I was disappointed with the ending.
3,"Interesting, but predictable story. Weak ending!","I had no idea what this book was about when I picked it up. I was hooked from the beginning and read on and on and on for what I thought would be a pretty neat ending. When I put the book down I realized I had no idea how or why it ended as it did. I felt as though the author wasn't sure how to wrap it up and just finished it quickly ... as though she'd had enough of it. For days I've thought about the ending and I still can't come to terms with the conclusion to the ""mystery"". Not good! This would be a great project for a College English class to allow the students to read the text and then develop an ending of their own! Was that what the author had in mind????"
4,Couldn't put it down...,"The kind of book you pick up and never want to put down, even if it means to go to sleep... Two days later, I was done!I highly recommend this novel, it keeps you on your toes and makes you think... do we really know the people in our lives, even the ones who are close to our hearts?Hmmm... and what if...Enjoy!"
2,Silly plot line leads to formulaic ending...,"This book can be summed up as such: Girl gets boy. Girl loses boy. Girl replaces boy with strong silent type and lives happily ever after. Ho-Hum!Other than a quick moving movie-of-the-week plot line this book offers little more substance than a store brand, caffeine free, diet soda. The events are predictable, the characters are formulaic and the circumstances are difficult to swallow (ask yourself why she didn't hire a lawyer early on...c'mon).The only thing that might have saved this book would have been a hard look at why her husband did what he did. But we can only guess at his motivation because...well...he was dead before the story began (literally). Sheesh.If you're on the beach or in a plane or killing time in a waiting room, and need something to occupy your mind for a stretch, pick up this nonsense and escape for a bit. But if, like me, you need something that is less Meg Ryan and more Meryl Streep then don't waste 300 pages here."
3,Slow At First,The book started off a little slow before it got to be really good. A little more than halfway through is when you get to the nitty gritty and you're then hooked and not able to put it down. I just ordered the movie to really see it in action.
2,Disappointing,"I read this after ""The Weight of Water"", which I thought was excellent. This book was very predictable - you could see the plot coming a mile away. I think in general, her reputation as a writer is overstated."
1,Dissapointing low-brow novel,"One of the reasons I read this book was because I saw the author had taught at Amherst college in western Mass. If this is the quality of writing skills they teach at that school then my previously high regard for the school has gone down.This is at best a trashy holiday-read. Shallow characters (characters get introduced but never developed), stereotypes (dashing tall airline pilots) and plot elements borrowed from every direction thrown into a blender.The underlying premise of the book was good (do you every really know somebody), but Ms Shreve needs to go on a creative-writing course to learn how to turn that into a well-written novel."
3,weak ending,"Like all of Shreve's work, THE PILOT'S WIFE drifts off to an unsatisfying ending. It is always the first 90% that keeps me reading her books."
2,The book is also a bomb!!!,"There are two bombs to the book, ""The Pilot's Wife""--the first one that was found in Jack's handbag on the aircraft, which lead to the explosion and the death of hundreds of passengers; the second bomb is the book itself.The book was shallow and totally predictable. I think I must have seen the same story line in about 10 movies already. No reason to hash it out once more in paperback.The only redeeming qualilty of this book is its cover. Besides that--everything is trite and uneventful. Doesn't probe the mind nor fascinate the reader. Cheap entertainment."
3,Quick Entertaining Read,I had higher expectations for this book. It was nice light read. Great if you want a quick book to read. The last chapter was terrible though.
3,Easily forgotten,"The title and situation hook you in, then the sensational beginning keeps you reading and waiting for the real story to start. Surely Kathryn is going to have a magnificent affair with the guy from the union (see I've forgotten his name already, he dwindled out of the story quickly as well after dominating the beginning - why?) A few days after finishing the book (yes I did finish it) I have all but forgotten every detail. A truly forgettable book but ok as a 'veg out'."
3,Predicatable,"Here's a book about a woman who's husband, the pilot of a plane dies in a crash off the coast of Ireland. Reading the back of the book, I thought the Pilot's Wife would contain much mystery and excitement. In fact, the book was fast paced, but didn't get truly exciting until half way through.The ending was also extremely predictable. It was unsatisfactory as well. There is a character mentioned in the middle of the book whom the reader thinks will be more involved, but isn't.The only good parts about The Pilot's Wife is that it's not boring and that the reason for the plane crash is a good explanation."
2,A disappointment,Friends told me this was a great book. The author was focused on the relationship between mother and daughter and seemed to throw in the rest without going into detail. A lot of expansion could of been done here. I also would like to mention that I was disappointed in the last line of the book. It seemed out of place. Shame on Oprah for recommending this one.
1,Don't Bother,I read all kinds of books from the most simple and predictable to the very involved and detailed. I can find appealing aspects in all kinds of writing. This book has none. It was the the most boring read I have ever had. It is below 1 star and worse than a really bad Lifetime movie.
2,Decent read,"The Pilot's Wife was overall pretty much just ""okay."" I didn't feel a connection with any of the characters even if I felt bad for Kathryn. However, it took me less than two days of light reading to finish it, so it was a nice study break for me."
2,Simply didn't fly for me,"Although this book has received excellent reviews, I thought it was stilted and predictable. A quick read; ""no brainer;"" good for the beach type book."
2,Predictable and dull,"I did not particularly enjoy this book for several reasons. First of all, I had absolutely no sympathy or any feeling at all for the main character. Secondly, her husband was a caricature of a man and it felt as though Shreve had spent very little time exploring his side of the story and more just trying to shock the reader with his betrayal. I have a hard time not finishing a book once I get started, and I did manage to make it to the end, but was bitterly disappointed by the conclusion. The one male character that was introduced ends up being her savior and her mate....blech....I would not recommend this to anyone."
4,I couldn't put it down.,I really enjoyed The Pilot's Wife by Anita Shreve. I want to read Shreve's other books now. I hadn't heard of her before this novel and I want to read her others. I think it would be a good movie.
1,Untouching,"From the beginning of the book I knew what was going to happen. I was not surprised at all. For lack of a better phrase, ""the book just didn't cut it""."
2,Not too exciting.....,"I felt it really dragged on and on about nothing, especially in the first half of the book. It picked up and became a little more interesting toward the middle and end but still nothing to rave about. The characters were just boring and hard to be interested in. I definetely wouldn't recommend this to anybody. This was my first book by this author, but I think I will give her another try with a different novel."
1,Oprah: queen of spin??????,"I can't believe the spin Oprah gave this. This is one of the worst books I've ever read. The characters are one dimensional and Mattie is too bratty to command any sympathy. I find it hard to believe this isn't the author's first book. What's with the constant and very annoying references to arms (crossed over the chest; crossed over the face, etc. etc. etc)?? Reads like a reject from Writing 101. Oprah has pulled two boners in a row. Three strikes and she's out as far as I'm concerned!!"
4,One hell of a page turner!,"Kathryn bring you into her world and does not let you go until the last words that leave her mouth. This is an outstanding novel. You feel every emotion, just like your there with Kathryn. It has romance, mystery, sorrow, and a bit of comedy all wrapped into one story. BRAVO!"
3,"Engrossing, but slow","I am not a fan of any books from Oprah's book club and was reluctant to read this one because of that fact. However, I was intrigued and have to admit that I read the book within three days, not necessarily because of Anita Shreve's writing, but I just plain and simple wanted to find out how it ended. Yes there were parts that were engrossing, however, I did find several paragraphs just hanging there and not totally relavant to the story. I felt that Kathyrn's character could have been developed better; Mattie's characterization of a 15-year-old was excellent. It did leave the nagging question in the back of my mind however: how could one not know? Ms. Shreve, I felt, did a fine job detailing average married life, trust, and bonds, and I suppose that's the answer to the question. An idea: Perhaps a novel on Muire Boland, and how she could live knowing she was married to a married man. Or perhaps from Jack's perspective in living a double life. Just a thought."
1,Give me a break.,"I was given this book as a Christmas gift from a woman who does watch Oprah. (I don't.) I was skeptical, but I love to read and don't mind taking recommendations. What a waste of a couple of hours this book was. The writing was flat, the characters were practically devoid of any realistic emotion, and the plot was so predictable I was just waiting for the ""revelation"" to come through so I could get it over with to see how Shreve dealt with it. I found the writing to be subpar and lifeless. I didn't care about this book, the characters or the author. That'll teach me to read ANYthing Oprah recommends."
2,Skip it -- you'll be glad you did,"Terribly disappointing, thoroughly unrealistic tale. Shreve did an admirable job portraying grief and the reaction to traumatic loss. But there's nothing else about this book that I found even remotely compelling."
2,Slow and poorly written,This book was a huge disappointment. I can't believe Oprah recommended it. The writing was amateurish. The story was obvious. I wouldn't read this author again.
1,Big Plot Holes,"Firstly, would a man like Jack really carry aboard a flight bag without taking a peek inside? Especially since he was aware of the danger.Then there's Robert. How convenient that Kathryn has a strong, caring man to fall into during the grieving process. Most women who lose their husbands must grieve alone - Robert's role was too cutesy. All we needed was a Mariah Carey song in the background. Women CAN survive a death without a white knight running in to save the day!!Hands up how many people would let strangers into the house to rummage through drawers? I think not, Anita. You boo-booed here in a big way.Oprah, I love you, but why this dud book?"
1,Painfully dull -- NOTHING HAPPENS HERE!,"I just finished this dull, dull, dull book, just read the last dull sentence and closed the dull covers (actually, the covers are the most interesting thing here, which just goes to show you that you can't judge a book by, well, you know).Maybe it's a woman's book, but I hate to say that and therefore insult the taste and intelligence of women.I'm not giving anything away when I tell you that this is the story of a woman who becomes a widow and has to deal with the tragedy of her husband's death. We learn all that within the first ten pages. It takes another 200 pages before anything -- I mean ANYTHING -- else happens. And what does happen is both predictable and dumb.It's a bad book, folks. Avoid it like the plague."
3,"Good, but VERY predictable","I really enjoyed the book although I do feel that it was very predictable. I didn't care for the past/present chapter changings, in fact, I was lost for 2-3 pages of the 2nd chapter, not realizing we were now in the past! I feel like Kathryn is a very weak person - to let her daughter walk all over her as well as the investigators etc. As for the ending, I'm not sure what she meant by ""I just wanted to make sure the children were allright"" (or something like that). Robert & her weren't even talking about Jack's kids and then she makes the statement and the book ends. Did I miss something?"
4,Was My Book Missing The Last Page??,"I really liked this book I could not stop reading it. It makes you think about people that you know, are they really who you think they are? I didn't like the ending, actually it didn't have an ending. I told my husband that I had to take my book back because some back pages were missing. Sure enough I go to the store and find that all the copies there have the same ending that I read!! I was annoyed because it was a good book but did it have to end like that??"
4,Fascinating and Ultimately Uplifting,"I thought this book was wonderful. While the subject is on it face depressing, it was more of the story of a strong woman person picking up the pieces of her life, after the death of her husband, and moves on with their life. It is also a mystery (why did the plane go down?). And the story of how someone (albeit fictional) comes to terms with betrayal.For those who do not liked depressing books, like those Oprah normally chooses, do not pass this book. Those however who have suffered the loss, might want to think twice. While much of Annie's grief and loss is wrapped in shock, it is still very strong."
2,This Could Have Been a Really Good Book,"The author came up with a hellava story, there just wasn't enough of it. This was almost a short story with the text looking like something turned in for homework and it had to be X amount of pages. I had just finished ""I Know This Much Is True"" right before reading this book. Maybe that was the problem. My comparison left this book a pale, sad second place."
2,Oprah made a big deal out of nothing...,I was expecting this book to be exciting from what Oprah said on her show. It was a very predictable book to me. I felt like I knew what would happen before each chapter ended. The only good thing about the book was that it didn't take long to finish!!!
4,A captivating book that you can't put down,"The Pilot's Wife is a wonderful book. From the first page, the author captures your attention Her descriptions are very detailed which allows the reader to feel as though he/she is living the same nightmare. The book is an easy read and moves very quickly. I didn't want it to end! I would highly recommemd this book!"
4,"A good, quick read","I usually don't enjoy the books Oprah chooses for her book club. So many of them are the same story - a young girl overcomes great adversity and is stronger for it. But this book was different, and I really enjoyed it. It was suspenseful, and I was never QUITE sure what the outcome was going to be. It was a little too descriptive for my taste, but I just skimmed those parts to get to the action. I'll definitely recommend this to my reading friends."
3,"A few dissapointments, but overall, a good book","The book was extremely well written; quite the page turner. I was, however, dissapointed with the plot. The reviews had made it seem as if Jack were a secret agent or something of the sort. It was a slight let down to learn he was having an affair. Besides that, Anita Shrive did a great job. I have already recommended the book to a bunch of friends."
2,Not impressed,"I read this book because my mother, an avid reader, recommended the author and said that this was her best book. Well....Mom does not always know best. I found the writing style tedious and the story boring. I couldn't wait to finish it so I could move on to another book!"
4,Your heart will jump into your throat,"Reading this book was like picking at a wound. It was painful, but I couldn't stop. A wife of a pilot is awakened in the middle of the night with the news that she hoped she'd never have to hear. Her husband's plane has crashed over the Atlantic. The heartache is palpable, but becomes even more so as the wife discovers there is more to know about her husband than she ever learned during their 16 year marriage. How well can we ever really know someone? Shreve examines this theme along with the aftermath of betrayal."
1,An insipid story,"While reading Shreve's work, I felt as if I was watching a bad made-for-TV-movie. The plot is quite trite and the prose a bore. It is a quick read, though, for anyone who has bought this book, it should be regarded as a sunk cost and quickly cast aside."
1,Save your Time and Money!,"I found this story very unbelievable and I had to suspend belief in order to get through to the end. It was hard to believe that Kathryn would have no idea that her husband was married to another woman at the same time, and that a wife could be that clueless for so long. This is not one of Oprah's better choices."
1,Remind me to ignore...,the bestsellers lists. Pedestrian writing style and incredibly boring characters (the most interesting one is the pilot and he's dead...). Just one more book about one more woman who's been through SO much but finds the strength in her noble woman's heart to rise above it and carry on.Another Pity Party...puleeeeze.
2,Disappointing,I really enjoyed the early chapters of this book and I was so looking forward to uncovering the twist. When the story began to reveal itself I was very disappointed. The twist was a let-down and the lead character's behavior didn't seem consistent with what I'd learned about her. Many of the geograhic/political/language choices in the portion of the book that takes place overseas are incorrect.
2,Naive wife marries cheating man,"This book was not even worth the time it took to read which was very quick anyway. I thought it was incredibly nuts that Kathryn didn't even notice over those 10 years that her husband was doing this, what world was she on? The characters in this book were very unbelievable, especially Mattie the daughter. Don't waste your time on this novel!"
3,"Not bad, but not great","It wasn't that great. Sorry folks. I felt the grief was well written, but the 'double life' thing was a little far fetched. The looming romance of the wife and investigator was less than interesting. The ending was a little weak... ok, a LOT weak. I don't mean to be a drag, but it wasn't all that wonderful. And is it me, or isn't Harrison Ford in a movie soon that is something like this story line? ""Random Hearts"" I think is the name of it. A crash and a double life... I hope that story is a little better."
1,Lackluster!,"The Pilot's Wife lacked a compelling story, compelling dialogue and compelling characters. I didn't feel bad for Kathryn; I didn't feel bad Robert and in general I felt absolutely nothing for no one in the story. The presentation lacked texture. Can anyone tell me why this insipid story made it to NYT Bestsellers list? Oh...maybe just like I bought the book, others bought it too -- expecting a good read."
2,"Compelling story but rather flat, shallow.","The question that Kathryn's daughter Mattie asks---Can one ever really know anyone?, shapes the focus of this story; and Katheryn's search for who her husband Jack really was compels the reader to want to see if she learns, and if so, what Jack really was like. The story line is interesting, even intriguing, but it has all the trappings of being made for Hollywood. It is a rather flat novel. Shreve does not get far beneath the surface of her characters or of the story. The main characters are stereotypical, and the texture of the various settings is rather empty. WEIGHT OF WATER is, in my opinion, a far superior novel, but even there the historical characters and the crime are what drives the novel and not the contemporary characters of Shreve's imaginiation."
4,This book is difficult to put down once you begin.,"Every page offers a surprise twist or turn which keeps the reader pinned to their seat or anxious to return to the story. The turn of events are unexpected and the characters are rich yet close enough to real life to relate to them. My husband became tired of my ""No way!"" comments as I peeled through. This is light entertainment and not a literary masterpiece but enjoyable all the same."
2,"So Boring and predictable, couldn't wait to finish it.","Why did I bother to finish it I ask myself? Because I was sure it had to get better. My first Oprah book club book, and if it's anything to go by, definately my last. I found it incredibly predictable and un-challenging. Very disappointing."
1,starting to read - need clif notes,Our book club is reading this for Aug of 1999. I would like to know if clif notes are available?
2,A very slow read until the final few chapters.,This book seems to go from bad to worse. The author gets very wordy at times with descriptions of completely irrelevant things. Then we are swung completely out in the unbelievable premis of her husband's double life. I wouldn't recommend it.
5,"Gripping, hard to put down. Well written and very enjoyable","The book captivates your attention within the first chapeter. The indepts writing style of the author allows you to know the characters, become involved with the plot and stick with it until the end. The writers discriptions allow you to see the events, be a part of them and not loose any connection with the story."
3,Captivating and depressing; hard to resolve both feelings.,"I felt short-changed in reading the Pilot's Wife because I was drawn in (Shreve is an excellent writer), expecting to make sense of the trajedy and aftermath of it (one painful situation after another without a let up), and wasn't able to. I really wanted to understand how the pilot could lead a double life - and why he chose the direction he did. Didn't he have other options for his pain? Why didn't he make use of them? I felt the writer wanted us to experience the Pilot's secretiveness and pain it caused his family- by leaving this info out! I didn't find this book light, casual or predictable as some others have written - rather intense, depressing, and disappointing... Next time I want to read one of her books, I think I'll find out first if anyone dies, gets sick, etc. so I can decide whether to read it or not."
4,you know what's going to happen but you can'y beleive it!!!!,I enjoyed this book a lot and even found my self reading it in the car. It's a great beach read book and page turning.
3,The pilots wife,A. Quick crown Fox jumped ice th candlestick xxx k#xxx. How do I get out of here and xxx continue with emu book
2,Are wives really that dumb and blind?,"This would have been a better book if the protagonist (the pilot's wife) wasn't so unbelievably stupid. She and her husband essentially lead separate lives, for years. This is because of his job as a pilot (supposedly). She just goes with the flow and never stops to think if things should really be THAT separate. So....She is easily deceived on a consistent basis, and for a long period of time...yet was totally surprised when the truth was revealed after her husband dies. Real, average women aren't that stupid."
2,Nothing special about this book,"I borrowed this book from a friend that loved it and insisted that I would love it too. The story is interesting, a woman that finds out about her husband's second life only after he dies. It could have been an awesome book if the author actually wrote interest things about the characters and added some thrill to the story. It was mild and boring, boring, boring. I turned every page expecting something interesting to happen and nothing ever happened, it was just very frustrating."
1,Hallmark Channel,"This was the first Anita Shreve book I read, and the Oprah's Book club choice sticker should have warned me that it was a contrived piece of chick lit. The whole book felt like a syrupy over-draamatisation of a TV movie of the week, with implausible characters and a ludicrous plot. The whole IRA stereotype was jack-hammered in; if a thin plot has any connection to Ireland, the IRA has to be involved! It reminded me of ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" (with super-unbelievable lines as ""Sinn Finn will take full credit for this!"" for an IRA attack, and the character's name being Charlie Baltimore), but at least the Long Kiss was funny. This book was an eye-roll; Shreve being the daughter of a commercial airline pilot made it more cringeworthy. Surely she should know better!"
2,well-written mediocrity,"I didn't hate this book, but I certainly didn't enjoy it, either. It starts off with a geniune tragedy, and then keeps widening the tragedy with small doses of revelation. There is a bit of mystery, but you can see the big reveal coming some way off.In the end you wind up with several emotionally damaged, tragic women, a male antagonist that is completely reprobate, and another male that casually uses women for his own agenda.I predict this book will end up as a made-for-TV movie on the Lifetime ""Men are Evil"" cable channel."
3,good writer,"My first Anita Shreve book was a satisfying read. Like my favorite author Anne Tyler, I like Shreve's style for detail and emotion. I did think the story dragged too long in griefville in the first half, but the second half developed into a well rounded drama. Story was believable, so were the characters, just a little long in spots (like many books). I'll look for another Shreve book in the future. Good writer."
4,"Fast-paced, good read","This book was a quick read and a page turner; I finished it in two days. The story was gripping and it was hard to put the book down because I wanted to know what was going to happen on the next page. Great story -I recommend it.My only warning is that it has a female focus. Those who appreciate a Tom Clancy like detailed explanation (who, what, why, where, and how of a dastardly deed) will not appreciate the book as much."
3,avid reader,The plot is predictable and is not very moving. It was a quick read almost not worth the effort.
2,Did I Miss Something?,"This is a book I really enjoyed reading. It captivated me fromt he very first page. However, as I got more into the book, and my eagerness to learn more about the plot grew, I seemed to have missed something. Something very important. Or perhaps the story wasn't as clearly written in the end. I finished the book not knowing how it ended. I have re=read it twice now, and still can't figure out the ending. I am so disappointed that such a wonderful book seemed to end so inexplicably. Help me."
4,Who knew???,"I knew instictively the story would wind around to 'another woman', and so it did. But an international terrorist too? I thought my ex-to-be was sneaky - puts a whole new light on the twisted, selfish male ego, doesn't it??"
4,"Nice, but not thrilling...","I must say I am a little surprised that this was an Oprah pick. This book doesn't possess near the writing quality of many of her other selections. But it was a good, easy read, a bit predictable, but fairly compelling nevertheless. I'd recommend it on a slow day anytime!"
2,Just Okay.,"Although I have to admit I enjoyed this book, I could not understand why it got such rave reviews. It was a very unoriginal story and VERY predictible. This is a perfect example of something that gets so overrated to the point that the reader or viewer is dissapointed... kind of like the Titanic movie. It was okay."
2,This is dark book that wanted to be an adventure.,"It is a quick read BECAUSE it is natural to want to skim over the post-death experience. And just when we happen upon the slightest hint of adventure, the book ended. This writer held tightly to the realism of death, which sacrificed what could have been a very scathing, juicy adventure."
2,Cliche and predictable in a comforting way...,"From a literary point of view, the book was written well. The story, however, seemed cliche and predictable. From the moment scraps of paper are found in a husband's (who travels for a living)jeans, another woman is the only possibility. Further, that Muire has children is almost as predictable -- why shouldn't she, just to thicken the plot?I was underwhelmed by the book, thinking that in the age-old struggle for men and women, marriages, and relationships to be understood, there might actually be a fresh twist. Unfortunately, I don't feel as if I found anything fresh, new, or revealing. Perhaps for some readers, however, that is a comfort. For me, it was a disappointment."
2,Much to do about nothing,"I also made the mistake of following Oprah's recommendation. This book was rather disappointing and quite boring. Although I did care about the Pilot's wife and I was surprised about her husband's deceit, it wasn't enough material to write a whole novel. It was predictable and the end of the book was slow to come."
4,Great Book!,The whole time I was reading this book I could see the characters in my head and the kind of life they had. When Kathryn was grieving and then finding out who husband really was I could really understand her character. What a great book!
5,A real page turner,"At first, this book made me so depressed. I could really feel all the pain and love Kathryn felt for her husband. I was reading it at the hair dressers, thinking "" I can't read this any more, it's too depressing"", when lady after lady came up to me and told me what a great book it was. So I kept on reading, and soon, the idea that something wasn't right in this marriage was revealed and I could not put the book down! What a great story - it held me to the end, as new insights and revealations came to light! Now, I want to read all her books!"
1,I can't believe how horrible this book is...,"I was hoping ""The Pilot's Wife"" would be an enjoyable read and not one I couldn't wait to finish. Anita Shreve's writing is so predictable and boring that you can't wait to actually put the book down. I know this review isn't exactly great, but there isn't much to say about such a poorly written and boring novel."
4,A Great and Simple Story,"I think that this book would have boring if it was written in any other way or by any other person. The way she goes into detail about the stages of grief, shock, and recovery from a heart broken by betrayal is very realistic. Shreve also uses flashback about every other chapter to entertain and suggest to the reader the huge difference between Kathryn's life ""then and now""; one of loyalty and one of betrayal and uncovered lies. It is a beautifully written story and there are enough characters for anyone to relate to this great novel."
3,Very sad story,"Interesting situation, Kathryn is deceived by her husband, but now he is dead. A very sad story in that she never gets the answers to her questions. The intermingling of flashbacks in nicely done, giving the reader, but not Kathryn, clues as to what's going on. I do wish that the character of Julia was more developed. The unfolding mystery was somewhat predictable, but following Kathryn with her clues made it a page turner (an easy read, got through it in three days)."
3,The Pilot's Wife,"I felt that this book was a rollercoaster ride with some good dips and sharp turns, yet it ended kind of flat. Overall, it was a good read, a good weekend beach book that goes quickly. I would recommend this book to many, but do not rate it among my favorites of all time. However, Shreve caught my interest and I will read some of her other works."
3,Average,"This book was good enough to finish, but disappointing after the description from my neighbor. The main female character was unimpressive and flat."
3,"An easy, entertaining read","I took another reviewer's advice and read this book on vacation. It kept my interest and it was a fast read. I thought that the character development in the first part of the book was excellent, even though the plot was predictable. However, the end of the book was somewhat anti-climactic. There was this huge buildup and then it all kind of got summarized in a perfunctory conclusion. If you don't want to get bogged down in a complicated novel, but you want an easy, entertaining read (like on vacation), then give this book a chance."
2,Extremely disappointed,"Having picked up several of Oprah's picks, and having read about the general plot, I was very disappointed. The idea was great, the execution fizzled. Wouldn't recommend it, and I'm wondering if I should pick up the other Shreve book I was contemplating."
3,"Fast paced and intriguing plot, but ultimately not memorable","I enjoyed the impactful, emotional pictures and the suspense. All in all it was a fair to good mystery with good character development but it does not belong on my,""must read again,"" shelf."
2,"Enticing concept, but I was extremely disappointed","I was enthralled with the concept of reading a book which was about not knowing the person to whom you've been married for so many years. However, Kathryn's character was not fully developed and you never get to understand why her husband, Jack became so discontented as to fall in love with the other woman and start on the road to his demise. The ending for me was a total let down...I even thought that my copy of the book was missing a few pages!!! A lot more could have been done to make the story more intriguing."
2,Trite,"This story is ridiculous. Interesting concept, but that's about it. The characters are never, ever developed and I so wanted them to be. They are cartoons! It's as if a child wrote this...how did this even get published? I feel foolish for having bought it, (and I paid full price), but I was desperate for a ""read"".The characters are shallow enough to make a ""fabulous"" Demi Moore feature film...look for it, it's bound to be."
3,HIghly readable.,"This book is fast paced and light, considering the subjects in the book. It is nice to see a book without any steamy sex scenes in it, but rather, a pleasant story, where you care for the characters and what happens to them. I'd recommend this book to anyone, except maybe recent widows and those wanting a book for the plane ride (especially not for overseas flying enjoyment)."
3,Not realistic,"It was an okay book until I got to the end. The main character's lax attitude toward her late husband's other wife was ludicris. The other woman was disrespectful in the most vile form, allowing herself to get involved with a married man, yet the main character didn't seem to see it that way. She just basically shrugged the whole matter off. I know there wasn't much she could do, but I would have at least liked to see a little more anger toward the situation."
2,The Pilot's Wife,"I just finished reading this book this morning. After reading 'The Last Time They Met', I decided to read another Shreve piece. It was a little disappointing, although I could not put it down because I wanted to get throught to the end to see exactly what Jack had been up to all that time. Makes people in relationships question how well they really know their partners. The ending was very predictable. I kept flipping back through the pages and re-reading some of the earlier chapters because I thought I had missed something. Read it if you have the time, but don't go out of your way!"
4,Unexpected!,"The Pilot's Wife was excellent! I just couldn't put it down! I read Sea Glass, but didn't like it. This book turned me back onto Anita Shreve."
1,Disappointed,"Well this was CERTAINLY a disappointment. This is the first book I have read that was recommended by the now defunct ""you know who's"" Book Club. There was no believeable character development thus no empathy ensued for the book's characters. And to boot, there were improbable situations and reactions by all characters in the book. I slogged through the book as I am recovering from surgery. I'd have been better off napping. Perhaps her other books are better?"
2,If you've seen a Lifetime movie you know how this story goes,"I made the mistake of blindly following the recommendations of the Oprah book club and buying this book. When I got into the gist of the story I had already figured out one of the ""secrets."" It was predictable and overdramatic. If you must read this one, don't waste your money--check it out from the library."
1,A very tedious book,"I tried to think of an apt word to describe this book, and after a while came up with ""tedious"". Tedious people, tedious plot, tedious writing, apart from the gaping holes in the plot. How long would it take the newspapers to ferret out the fact that that the man had two families? It wouldn't go unnoticed for long. It has not encouraged me to try any more of the authors books."
4,Couldn't put it down ...,"The book just sucked you right through. You're finished before you know it . . . wishing the end had not arrived so quickly. The suttle development of the main character, Astrid, becomes so evident in the surprising end. And I do stress SURPRISING!! Makes one ponder ... nature or nuture??"
2,Quite Unbelievable,"Although this book was a page turner it is an unrealistic and at times boring book. Some of the descriptions of clothing, living quarters, etc. was tedious. And the plot? Forget it...it is like a bad made for tv movie. I would have given it only one star but the extra star is for the author wisely not including any descriptive sex scenes. That truly would have made this book worth trashing."
4,"A beach book, with substance","Anita Shreve is proving to be a very versitile writer who has somthing to offer for everyone. While the plot is somewhat predictible, the psychological issues addressed make this novel well worth reading. The reader gets swept up in Kathryn's nightmare, all the while knowing that there is something very wrong in her marriage that she refuses to acknowledge. This is a stay up all night and finish kind of book. While The Weight of Water and Eden Close have more depth to them, this is fun reading-with class- at its best!"
1,Insomia? Try reading this one...,Predictable and plain boring. I tried to feel for Kathyrn but could not find empathy for any of the characters. It took me over a week to read this book. I had to force myself to turn the pages. I will confess that I finished the book but breathed a heavy sigh of relief when I was able to put this one of the shelf.
5,Gut Wrenching but Impossible To Put Down,Anita Shreve is an artist when it comes to writing novels. This was the first book of Anita's that I read and after finishing it I ran out bought every single book she has writen.Not than I am a big fan of Oprah but she certainly does pick great books. This was one of the most paralyzing books I have ever read. It made me truly appreciate my husband and the importance of marriage.This books takes you to places that are unimaginable but still the reader can't put the book down. While the subject matter may be difficult for some it is really an amazing novel and worth reading.
2,Too Predictable...Poor Style,"The premise of the book - love and betrayal - had my interest throughout the novel. However, the character development was poorly carried out after a good start. It seemed that the plot lost its steam with a very very long and tedious set-up. But I kept reading through the end to find that there weren't any twists or further psychological developments...on top of that there was a cheesy new relationship being developed that I felt was only to appease the stupider readers who couldn't handle an ending that left the woman - whom we are supposed to view as gaining emotional strength throughout her ordeal - single. I think I need to pick up a real novel (e.g. Thomas Hardy) next time. These modern best-sellers are painful."
2,Disappointing and Predictable,"I love to read and when I finished this book, I felt as though I had wasted my time. This was the same old story told in the same old way. How many ways can you tell this story before it gets monotonous?"
3,good but not great,"I usually love Oprah's books and this one was ok but not great. I was really intriqued with the idea ""can you ever really know somebody?"" but it didn't deliver much on this topic. It seemed sort of rushed towards the end. The climax was presented 30 pages from the end and after a few pages not dicussed much. I wanted to know more about how Jack lived his double life and got away with it for as long as he did."
1,The worse Oprah Book Club selection to date.,"Part I of the Pilot's Wife was a little slow and so I had hoped Part II would pick up the pace, but I was wrong. I had thought about reading this book when it first came out, but was influenced by a bad review so I did not buy it. But when I heard it was an Oprah selection, I decided to give it a try. THE PILOT'S WIFE WAS A WASTE OF MY PRECIOUS TIME and MONEY."
4,An easy read! I enjoyed it!,"I have to say, I truly enjoyed this book. I am not heavily into reading but once I started this book, I couldn't put it down and I finished it in 4 days! Totally unlike me! I will continue to read Anita Shreve now that I like her style!"
1,I'm donating my copy to the local library,"This book was awful. I purchased it for these reasons: Oprah raved about it, I was curious, and the local library wait-list was too long. The story was so predictable it could have been written as a 2 column piece in a tabloid. Ugh. Oprah's picks are popular because many of us don't require much intellectual stimulation. Never to be duped again, will I rely on a celebrity's word about books."
1,Waste of time!,"How did this book get an Oprah recommendation? Superficial, boring, predictable and amaturish - don't waste your time on this one!"
4,Interesting but flawed novel concerning identity,"Kathryn Lyons is a pilot's wife. Her husband, Jack, is killed in a plane crash. So begins page one of Ms. Shreve's novel who asks the question: How well do we know our significant other? As events unfold, Jack's life seems suspicious to Kathryn who therefore does some major digging and puzzle-solving to compile the entire picture of her husband, Jack. Ms. Shreve's writing is, most of the time, intelligent and nicely structured as she keeps her story moving by giving subtle hints and clues which keeps us turning pages. However, certain scenes and dialogue are filled with cliches which give the appearance of Ms. Shreve becoming lazy in her choices. Still, all in all, this is a nice, easily-read novel giving readers food-for-thought not only in examining our own relationships but in understanding that the effects are ever-lasting even though our lives continue. Again, a nice selection for Oprah Winfrey to make for us readers."
3,Not Quite Sure,"I just finished this book. I read it on the recommendation of Oprah and I can't remember what she was going on and on about on the show that day but I kept waiting for something to happen that would make me go ""on and on"". Nothing did. It was an OK book, much better, I think than ""The Reader"" which I came to see most people didn't like either. Come on Oprah! How about ""My Year of Meats"" by Ruth L. Ozeki, which is about the beef industry and would be a chance to dig them a bit in a safe kind of way. It was a great book."
2,If you like Danielle Steele...,"If you like Danielle Steele, then you will like this book. If not, this book sucks. It is very predictable, and it is more like a love story than anything else"
4,"Enjoyable, engrossing read!","I read this book in one evening. It was one of those books that I couldn't put down, but at the same time, didn't want to end. Yes, some of it was predictable, but still very entertaining. I'll read more of Shreve's books."
4,"surprise ending, good emotion","i liked the story, the progression and the book had a great ending - totally not what I expected when i read the first chapter."
3,"Good Book, but dragged on a little","As a flight attendant, I enjoy reading any novels having to do with the airline industry. I recently finished this book, and while I did really enjoy it, it wasn't quite as exciting as I thought it would be. I agree with some of the other readers who said it didn't have enough exuberance and it did drag on some. Overall though, I would recommend it."
2,just okay,"I was initially excited about reading this much-recommended book but found the story implausible. It started off very intriguing; shedding light on how a pilot's wife is dealt with following a downed plane. This part really pulled me in to the story. The whole business with the secret life really got too far fetched and made me think ""boy, this is a made for TV movie plot"" not one of my favorite genres."
3,Reluctant Approval,"I really struggled with this book. I'll admit to being too snobby about books which find a wide audience and I'm afriad I may have carried that baggage into reading this book. I thought Kathryn was too naive and seemed to experience life as it happened to her instead of having any power to change the circumstances into which she was thrust. However, I don't really know how a person asserts power when facing such complete loss. Even so, I found the whole notion of Jack's utter betrayal of Kathryn somewhat incredible. How could a man who deeply cares for his daughter so totally disregard the feelings of his wife?Ultimately, the book is both entertaining and relevant but it is not very deep. Kathryn Lyons is simply a vessel for the story and no details differentiate her from any widow who finds out that her dearly departed husband was a jerk and a liar."
5,"A brilliantly written, gripping story with enormous insight","As a longtime fan of Anita Shreve, I grabbed his book the minute it showed up in bookstores. I was not disappointed. Shreve has written a beautifully modulated novel about marriage, about how one can never really know another person, all in the context of a plane crash and its political and emotional aftermath.I find it a stunning work and give it the highest possible recommendation."
4,"An entertaining, quick read","This book was entertaining and believable. I was a little confused about who actually planted the bomb, but the rest of the story was cohesive. I felt the end of the book was appropriate and showed the depth of Kathryn's personality. Jack is also a believable character. Being abandoned as a child leaves scars that often manifest in covert behaviors. It would have seemed stranger to me if he had not been somewhat screwed-up. Kathryn managed a ""normal"" life because of the love of Julia."
3,Quick summer reading....,"I just finished _The Pilot's Wife_ last night. My assessment? It falls somewhere between ""great literature"" and ""crap."" :) In other words, a mildly entertaining and generally average read.A good choice if you have a short attention span....it only takes a couple of hours to read from cover to cover. So, grab this book, pour yourself an iced tea, and settle in to your favorite lawn chair.....after all, your brain deserves a summer vacation too!!"
3,touching beginning; disappointing ending,"After listening to Oprah rave about this book, I ran right out and bought it. I had just experienced a death in my family and found Shreve's description of the grieving process quite accurate. As I read the book, I felt better knowing I wasn't the only one feeling that way. However, as the book drug on, I was ready for more action and less emotions. I was especially disappointed in the obscure ending. I guess I figured Oprah had better taste than that."
5,Thoroughly entertaining,"I absolutely loved this book. The only problem that I had (and that was only in the beginning), was the way the author would switch from past to present from one chapter to the next. Once I got used to that, it became another of those quirky things that I liked about the book. Read it, you won't be sorry."
1,Too predictable,I read this book on a weekend. I read this book in two days because I wanted to get it over with and get on with my life. I finished the book hoping that I would understand why people found this book so interesting. I knew the plot once I found out Kathryn and her husband had separate accounts. It was predictable and there seemed to be very little character development.
4,An easy read but very good,My sister recommended this book to me and I didn't think I would really enjoy it. I started reading it on Friday afternoon and finished it by Saturday! I couldn't put it down. I agree with a previous review that there were some typos and a few sudden locale changes without explanation (I had to reread paragraphs several times to make sure I didn't miss something). However it was still good and definitely a good beach read!
3,"A Quick, Enjoyable Read","I thought the book was enjoyable, but.... the ending was rushed and didn't make much sense. Who acts that way??"
2,Summer reading,"This is not a remarkable book, but one which fills the bill for an easy read. Take it on vacation or to the beach."
2,Could have been better,"When I picked up the book, I expected something a little more exciting...I did read the book to completion, but I was wondering why the main character was so ...unapealling. I didn't really care what happened to her, but more about the plot. It was okay, not really worthy of an Oprah recommendation."
2,Skip it if you are a Pilot's wife,"I was very disappointed in this book. It was extremely overrated. The plot was weak, predictible, and unrealistic. From the beginning, I could see were the story was going. Pilot has an affair with a Flight Attendant - could anything be more cliche? I was annoyed at how oblivious that Kathryn was to Jack's schedules. Everyone knows that an international pilot would never work 5 days on and two off. Also, Ms. Shreve, I would love to know how a pilot starting with a startup airline could have every qualified for a mortgage on a $400,000 house. There are too many inaccuracies for me to list and too many questions left unanswered."
1,80 Pages is a Fair Chance!,"Before today, I had never looked at the reader reviews while I read a book, but I just had to know ""is this worth it?"" Clearly not. Thank you all for sparing me. I kept going - 80 painful pages - waiting for some sign that this book would improve. It seems my initial impression (this book is worthless!) was correct.At BEST, The Pilot's Wife is an easy read. If you don't want an intriguing plot, a creative use of language or complex characters, this is the book for you! It is terribly unoriginal. My goodness, if she can get published, so can I!"
3,"A fun, easy read -- not to be taken too seriously","I liked this book, though it's certainly no masterpiece. If you don't take it too seriously, you should enjoy it. I particularly liked the character, Robert, at least until Shreve made him skilled pianist?"
2,"If this was a movie, it would have been panned.","This is the first book I have read from Oprah's Book Club. The first half of the book was good - well developed characters, good plot line, etc. Then it fell apart. It seemed like the author had no idea how to bring things to closure. Character development ended and we had just some barely connected scenes. I know how hard it is to keep the effort going once the ""denouement"" has been reached, but this author didn't appear to even try. I am disappointed that this was a selection of this book club and will be very careful before buying another of Oprah's choices."
2,Last line confusing,"This is the first book by Anita Shreve that I have read. It's hard to believe that the airlines would handle a difficult situation as a devasting crash the way it was described in the book. I didn't understand the last line ""I just wanted to know if the children are all right,"" she said across the sea. Did I miss something?"
3,I was disappointed. Plot seemed predictible.,"I was very disappointed in this book . . . especially in light of the ""Oprah's Book Club"" endorsement. The plot line seemed predictible, and I'm confused by the last sentence. Passed it on to a friend and will see what I get from her as feedback."
3,It's driving me crazy..........,"Wasn't there a movie with a similar plot? The whole encounter with the London wife was reminiscent of some movie I saw, but I can't for the life me think of the title.Or maybe I'm just anticipating where this novel is headed. I'm predicting Julia Roberts will get the part as Kathryn. I think Robert could probably be played by Harrison Ford.I agree with other readers who felt this book started off great and then let the reader down."
3,The Fatal Flaw,"In a short comment about this book, I mentioned a fatal and sloppy flaw in the story. Since then a few people have sent me e mails to ask what this flaw is. I had decided not to post it here as those who had not yet read the book may be let down, but here goes: Wife #1 in America(the real wife if wou will)discovers the 2nd wife in London. OK. Good so far. BUT toward the very end of the book we hear that Wife #2 stood trial and is in jail. Now during this trial Wife 2 would have been asked what her relationship to the piot was. And she would have replied, rightly, ""his wife"". And THAT would have got out. There would be NO hiding it after that. Hence Wife #1 could not have kept it a secret from her daughter. Or indeed anyone. It boggles me how the author and editor allowed this to pass by. Sloppy and it cheats the reader terribly. Anita Shreve is a good writer, but how she allowed this to slip past is beyond me. I know my editor would have come down me heavily. Not good enough."
3,"A Quick Read that I enjoyed, but it left me unfulfilled","I have to agree with those who felt that the plot of this novel dissipated during the second half of the book. It was a very entertaining and intriguing story, but all of the build up of the first half seemed too quickly explained during the second half. As I got to know the character of Kathryn, I wondered -- how could anyone have such a vague knowledge of her own husband? In that respect, I found it quite disturbing...in that one never truly knows anyone...not even the ones you love. I enjoyed the book, but it ended too quickly for me."
1,This book is a total waste of time,"I agree wholeheartedly with the reader who described this book as predictable and shallow. It reads like a made-for-TV movie. Its only redeeming quality is it's an easy read, getting us to its uninspiring end that much quicker."
1,And the point of this book was...?,"I don't understand the popularity of this book. If I could rate the book with zero stars, I would. To be honest, I was bored to death with it. The story was predicatable; it wasn't involving; the characters weren't particularly interesting; the plot was unremarkable; and the writing was often uneven - the author tried too hard with the prose. Sometimes she got it right; most of the time she didn't. Like other readers, I kept hoping it was going to get better or maybe something might happen that I wasn't expecting. It didn't. Sadly, I was disappointed."
1,Sorry Anita but I thought this book was almost unbearable!,"Reading over the reviews I am amazed that some people can call this a masterpiece and others a complete flop. I did not like anything at all about this book. There wasn't one character that I liked or cared about what happened to. This combined with the many different things brought up but never really dealt with (for instance Mattie's confesion of having ""done it"" when she was not quite 14. I get the feeling that would have been a bigger issue with most mothers, husband dead or not. The writing did nothing for me, I thought it was to thought out. I knew I would hate this book after the first sentence, gramatically correct or not it was not a sentence in my head - too flowery."
1,Predictable,"I find it hard to understand why literature that is so incredibly simple and dull becomes a best seller. Ms. Shreve's writing is comparable to a high school student's, and her plot is as predictable as a bad Hollywood movie. For the re-print, may I suggest the cover sport a photograph of Fabio dressed as a pilot? And, for added drama, Kathryn should wear Enzo Angiolini mules instead of Easy Spirit flats. Don't waste your reading time."
1,Could have been great but so superficial,"I am happy Oprah has her book group as it gts people reading. I believe she should upgrade her reading list and her audience would respond accordingly. The Pilot's wife could have bena true character study of huma nature, but instead took a serious issue and made it rather superficial and contrived. You knew what was going to hapen after the first 30 pages. Pick plot OR character development neither was met here. How hard it is it to find sympahty with a ""pilot's wife""? Put a little debth to her character and you might have had a beter story. All in all a very unsatisfying page turner."
2,Montanan says.....What happened?,"Give Anita Shreve some credit. She hooks you into what appears to be a well-written, well-paced novel about a woman grieving the loss of her husband, a pilot killed when his airliner crashes. But pretty quickly the questions crop up: Why do the airline people take over her house? Why does she let them tell her what to do? Why is she such a whimp? Sadly, despite some nice plot twists, the novel loses momentum and credibility. In the end, (finally relieved that this book is coming to an end) when you read the last sentence, you ask yourself...what happened? Lots of potential here, but sadly under-utilized."
4,A Way with Words,"This book is a quick read, and enjoyable. I read the first third of it outloud to someone on a three hour drive. He keeps asking my how it ended...I told him he'll have to read it.I enjoyed the word pictures and writing style as well as the actual story. A good vacation book."
4,Easy Reader,"From the moment I opened this book, I did not put it down until I finished it. The text was easy to read. The story line was easy to follow. It is a great book to read on rainy Sunday. I escaped for the day into this book."
3,It should be called - A Pilot's Bore!!!,"The characters were not well developed! The store was very slow moving, and yes, the ending was VERY predictable. It was well written though, despite the negatives. I am glad I paid next to nothing for the book, because I would be mad, if I paid full price. It is worth a penny, just for entertainment sake!"
2,Very ordinary,"After wading through the first third of the book, hoping for some kind of payoff for my patience, I was not to be rewarded after all. It was basically a very ordinary book; nothing memorable to take away with you. It was forgotten as soon as I closed the book."
1,Oprah disappoints AGAIN!,"After reading and loving ""Fortune's Rocks"" by Shreve and knowing it was given the stamp of approval by Oprah, I began ""The Pilot's Wife"" prepared to settle down with a good, solid, interesting book. IT STUNK! This is, perhaps, one of the most boring books I have ever read - right up there with the Pulitzer Prize winning ""A Death in the Family"". I didn't care about any of the characters in this book - I was too busy wishing it would either get better or end. It never got better. Fortunately, it ended!"
2,Not up to Random Hearts.,"I will not go into the story line as so many others have allready and I don't want to spoil it for someone else. I bought this because of the reviews after watching the movie and reading the book Random Hearts. It was like a drink of water compared to a shot of booze. Same story line, but The Pilots Wife didn't have any kick in it. Like one person wrote, I have been through it all before. Dull characters, slow paced and poor ending. I found myself skipping pages to speed up the action. We all have different taste in our reading so if it sounds good to you, go for it. As the old saying goes, One persons garbage is anothers treasure."
4,Where is the rest of the book?,"Read the whole thing in a day... couldn't put it down. Then got to the end. Flipped through the last few pages. Where is the rest of the story? This is the end?Bottom line: Great, well written book. Ending sucks."
2,Was good for a couple months until it died,I loved this piece until it suddenly died on me. Thank God I didn't have anything important on it that I didn't have a copy of. Make sure you always back up your data- you certainly can't rely on this to keep your only copy.
5,Item performed as advertised.,"A very handy item. Especially if you want a desk top with all of your pertinent downloads to travel with you. A must if you have to log onto various computer stations, away from yours."
3,Lack of a lanyard,"Previously the SanDisk Cruser Flash Drives came with a lanyard with a quick disconnect that allowed you to disconnect it and use it or to keep the lanyard attached. This provided security and convenience and ""a place to keep it."" I feel that the decision to no longer provide the lanyard was a bad business decision. There apparently isn't even the option of purchasing the lanyard as an accessory.I would have rated the Cruser a 5 but the decision to eliminate the lanyard is very short sighted."
2,Annoying preloaded program,"It comes with a preloaded ""launcher"" whose purpose seems to be merely to get you to download certain programs. You can't even format the thing to get rid of it, and telling it NOT to autorun results in... it autorunning. It even pops up an annoying ""you didn't eject this device properly last time"" box when you reinsert the drive.Luckily, sandisk offers a removal tool. (Search sandisk's site for cruzer launcher removal.) Of course, last time I checked, the only things most people use ""removal tools"" for are viruses.After using the removal tool, it functions like a normal, healthy USB flash drive."
2,IT SUX,"I bought this item last year and within few months it started having problems. After plugging it in, it started blinking, blinking, blinking and blinking....then nothing after that. I lost all my data but kept it for months hoping to find a friend who can retrieve what I had lost. After few months, my friend was able to find everything and move it over to another hard drive. I was so very happy to get everything back. I would never purchase another sandisk brand and wouldnt recommend it either."
2,Cruzer Kind of Sloppy,I purchased this to replace a sony flash drive I lost. It works really well but I am nervous that the usb is kind of sloppy so I'm very careful when I plug it in and remove it from my computer. I like the sony better because it seems more sturdy although the cruzer works satisfactorily.
5,Great product...,This is a really good product...but unfortunately i lost it within 2 days...so far i lost 2 of these...so beware!
1,intensely irksome U3 software,"You are supposed to plug a stick in, use it, and pull it out. This thing has annoying, delaying software trying to ""help"". Look: I'm in the middle of other things! You have to run the SW to unplug...wow, is that a step backwards. And then today it puts me through a 3 minute upgrade process. This is so bogus, insinuating yourself into someone's application space. If I go to another PC, the intall pain all over. No more quick file moving??!!!! I can't accept this drive at work anymore. What is wrong with these people?"
1,Piece of Junk,"Stay away from this thumb drive! My girlfriend made the mistake of buying it and everytime you plug it in, it tries to boot up its software. If there is a way of turning it off, its not easy. SanDisk should not force users to run some time-consuming software when they simply need to copy files to and from the drive.Other than that, the drive runs fine and works smoothly on Mac and PC. Hey at least on the Mac it doesn't try to run its software."
1,SanDisk,"Not as advertised. It does not come with the U3 software. You can download it from the internet, but none of the browser functions are available. Useless unless you just want another blank memory device."
3,mixed performance disappointment,I bought this since it was rated to improve PC performance as a Vista ready-boost drive and the price was right at $24. I did not notice much of a benefit mainly because of odd stoppages in applications being loaded (like Nero 7) which would load and run only AFTER the SanDisk was unplugged. SO this drive is just being used for data transfers.
5,Perfect little drive,"This is my second Cruzer Micro. I have had the 4 GB version for about 6 months and loved it so much I bought this one for my wife. I have it attached mine to my key chain and carry it at all times. Since it is so light and small there is no draw back to carrying it everywhere.There are only two small negatives to this product, but neither were big enough to keep me from buying a second drive. The plastic it is made out of feels a little weak, but it has made it has held up very well. The painted on print has almost completely worn off from rubbing up against keys.All in all, this is a very good product and I highly recommend it."
4,nice pen,"well this is a nice pen for you or a friend... the price is not that high, so you can use it to make a gift... yeah for those who doesnt give a simple stuff on birthday's partys is perfect jajjajaalso there is always some one whithout a flashi'm not still satisffied whith U3 cause is too irksome"
5,Flash Drive,This flash drive is awesome I am very happy with performance and it is fast and easy to use I definitely recommend it
3,TONS of Packaging! IT Professionals beware!,"I just bought a bunch of these for my office. They work fine and get the job done, but they have tons of packaging attached to them. A cardboard flat, plastic case, and manual that you destroy when opening the package. Next time, I would choose another brand just to save the environment a little. I had to separate all of the cardboard and plastic to properly recycle all of this and it took almost 30 mins for 25 flash drives."
2,Very easy to lose!,"I bought this and put it on my keychain since it has a keyring attached to the flash drive. I should have known the keyring was flimsy from the thin metal they provide. It fell off my keychain after a few weeks and I was never able to find it. I have read other reviews of this product being lost easily too. If you don't use it as a keychain you should be fine, but another negative is that this flashdrive adds software to your computer while many other brands do not. For these 2 reasons, I give this product 2 stars."
5,a great thing 2 have,"this goes in depth. tells you how to unlock cars, where hidden treasure is all the different types of cars. and lots more. great for any one."
4,Guide in the right direction,"Mr.Bogenn's guide is just that. Simply put, the best approach to Vice City is trial and error. This is how you learn things as important as how to get into the golf course with all your weapons, or as silly as puting four tires on the Sparrow helicopter. As a guide the book serves it's purpose, although some of the author's methods are taking the long way to a short path."
4,Decent Strategy for the Game...,"This book has perfect strategies for every mission...The maps are very detailed, and locations for hidden packages are included, as well as side missions and complete lists of rewards you can get in the game. The only problem I had with this guide was that it does not contain cheat codes. Cheats can usually be located somewhere online, but I was still a little disappointed as the main reason I bought the book was for the cheat codes that they said were in there. However, don't let that stop you from getting the guide, it still help get you through the game really well and it has cool pictures too! Not to mention the full weapons and vehicles section, character profiles, and spoilers if you want them. Another success by BradyGames!"
4,Hard-to-find Great Guide,"All of my friends have one and I've read through it, and other than the occasional slip-up on the prices on some real estate, it's a really nice guide. I'll tell you what though. I live in Columbus Ohio and nobody has them.Gamestop, Media Play, KB Toys, their all sold out. This is about the olny way I can get one. I need one really bad to unlock the hidden ""Hunter"" and some other stuff.- Really Great Guide"
1,Why pay for a strategy guide?,"This book is okay and moderately helpful, but why would you need to spend anything to get only one point of view on strategy for Grand Theft Auto: Vice City? Just go to GameFaqs.com and check out all the *free* stuff that has been written about this great game. (See: http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/ps2/game/33074.html.) Waste your money, if you want, but at least check out GameFaqs.com before purchasing Bogenn's book."
4,more conditioning than curling,"on its own my hair tends towards waves rather than spirals, so i was hoping for more of a curling effect, but the typical dryness of my hair is noticably tempered so overall i'd say will buy again - gave me the from-the-sea waves without the in-the-sun strawness"
3,Curly Mist,"I have this and like it. I wish it would make my curls tighter, but that is ok. Otherwise still a really good curling additive and it smells nice too. Would buy again!"
5,Love is n da air....,Ilove this product! My 2 year old son has the cutest curls and this mikes it feel and look soft and health. Buy this and love it like I do. The serum is good to.
3,"Half flat, half fitted","I didn't look at the product description close enough and was surprised to get a sheet that had elastic around one end. Good idea, but not what I was looking for. The sheet fits fine, but has small holes on the sides, as if it should have been sewn there, but the machine ran out of thread. Overall, it gets the job done, but my toddler doesn't like her feet to be tucked in and gets tangled up in the elastic."
3,top sheet,"I wanted a top sheet for the toddler bed and was going to make them out of a bottom sheet but then found these. After much debate due to the cost, I bought two. I plan to keep them because they work and they are for the grandchildren that stay occasionally. They are somewhat thin and short. The colors are good and soft but still not worth the price."
1,One of the worst books I've read in a long time.,"Although it includes a few helpful tips (such as the list of interview questions in the back), most of the information does not go beyond common sense. The frequent typos and poor writing give the impression that the author simply sat down and wrote the first thoughts that sprang to mind, without bothering to go back and polish her work."
5,One of my favorites!,"Anna Stanley's insight as a contestant, judge, and director makes her book an outstanding guide for contestants. Her coverage on each phase of competition has thoroughly prepared me for my state and national crown. The appendix of resources serves as an effective aid for contestants with their pre-pageant packing and research. ""The Crowning Touch"" is a valuable reference source for all pageant affiliates and would be a wonderful edition to your library."
5,Very Helpful!,"Although this book seemed to steal a bit of material from others--like anecdotes from another pageant book I know--it was EXTREMELY detailed and helpful in getting prepared and realizing that IMAGE IS EVERYTHING in a pageant. Honestly, I can't see how I competed without buying this book first. This book practically gives the formula for success, even how to stand and walk in swimsuit! I can't wait for my next competition!"
3,Common sense advice,This book is good for anyone thinking of entering a pageant for the first time. Easy to read. Reading can be done in about an hour or less. It is good to make notes on things that stand out.
4,Great Book,"This book is really great! Although it has some mistakes in the writing, the content is really useful to those who has interest in compete in pageants and pageant trainers."
2,From what I've heard - unimpressed.,"I've listened to this album several times through, but the hooks and melodies just don't stick in my head. If the songwriting is bad on this album, the vocalist is terrible. I don't hear the emotion... I don't hear the range. The instrumental songs on here are pretty good (The Fall Of Reason nearly comes to an epic bombast), but the rest of the songs are more-or-less boring. This album as a whole is not powerful to me and it just can't hold my attention. ""Two Versions of the Same"", however, is very good - too bad the songwriting couldn't carry over to the rest of the tracks."
4,Great CD,"This band is a definite must have in anyone's prog metal collection. Very heavy emphasis on accentuation and fantastic melodies. Vocals on this album are absolutely insane. 24 second note solo is where it is at.The only drawbacks I see is that like any prog act, it sounds very similar to other's before it, but the rhythmic qualities and harmonies make this album stand out. Lyrics can be deep at times but also seem odd word choices. Also the vocals although absolutely amazing are definitely a reminder of the 80's keyboard bands. As great as they are, they stand out a bit too much."
4,YES!,"Finally Olaf has totally revamped Vision Divine. This album it's obvious, they woke up or something because it blows their past works away. This is the best CD I've bought in a long time / Sometimes the keyboarding can become overpowering (Annoying), but the vocals and composition are a pinnacle for melodic power metal. The story also kicks ass! Definately worth the money, buy it."
2,Very Compaq Centric,"This book is very Compaq biased. Some of the text reads like a marketing glossy from Compaq: ""Compaq was the first to announce new products that can...."". This statement would be fine if it was part of a survey of vendor offerings, but to be presented as a sole opinion is disgraceful. There is no indication on the cover or otherwise prominently displayed on the book that this book is laced with Compaq ads. They should be paying me to read this book, for I am certainly not the biggest fan of Compaq products. On a more positive note, there is some decent advice on how to structure your business for internet commerce."
2,For obsessive collectors only,"I like Jack McDuff but I was rather disappointed by this release. In reading the inside liner notes, I then understood why. Basically, this collects all the songs from his 60's releases that hadn't appeared on the other ""Good'Un"" albums (wish they'd noted that on the back of the CD). In short, they picked through all the best stuff for those other albums and this album incorporates all the remnants.It's not bad, and there are a couple of pretty good songs (""The Morning Song"", ""What's Shakin'"") but for the most part it's rather uninspiring organ soul jazz with a number of eight minute songs that get boring about half way thru. You're better off with other McDuff albums (such as ""Live"")."
4,Geography and the Web,"Cyberspace has a connectivity all its own; these days most commonly expressed by the linkages between HTML documents put on the web. Conversely, the real world has a physical geography. Thus far, there have been some linkages between the two, like mapping software on the web.But the authors go way beyond that simple application. They provide imaginative suggestions of how cyberspace, and most importantly, a pervasive wireless connectivity to it, can enable a nomadic environment where you can get information from cyberspace about your physical surroundings. Plus, of course, enhanced interactions with those surroundings, based on this data.It appears that the study and use of geography, as currently performed, may soon undergo profound changes, in a way that will give it key commercial utility."
5,A necessary item if you want nice hair and skin.,"I have always used filtered water for drinking and cooking to avoid chlorine and other contaminants. I had been having a problem with my hair color fading super fast and my hair dresser suggested our highly chlorinated water was doing it. I bought a hand held shower with one of these filters inside and it not only kept my hair color from fading, but my skin is no longer dry and feels much nicer. I am so used to having the shower filter now that I notice a huge difference in my hair and skin whenever we travel and stay in hotels. I highly recommend this product as necessary to good hair and skin. It is money well spent!"
4,good.,"Like that the fact that these filters last a long time, it's nice to use and not get the hard water..this keeps skin smooth."
5,Excellent Filter,"I was having such a problem with my hair color fading and could not figure out why. We have city water but I would get blonde highlights and they would fade away within a few days of coloring. Finally I decided to get a filter after reading reviews and that did the trick. Not only has it saved my hair color, but my hair is softer and healthier than ever and my skin is less dry. Highly recommend!"
3,"Okay, but not the best","Kirsten is worried that christmas won't be the same as it was in Sweeden. She discribes to her cousins Anna and Lisbeth the traditional St. Lucia day, and they decide to suprise their families by organizing a St. Lucia celebration with the help of Miss Winston in . The only problem is Kirsten's family has not made the trip to Maryville to collect their trunks which contains Kirsten's St. Lucia gown. Kirsten pesters her family about it, and finally Kirsten and her father makes the trip to Maryville. But then on the way back they get caught in a blizzard, Kirsten begins to wonder if they will get back in time for the celebration.It has a good story, but if you're looking for a classic historical fiction, I suggest you try something else."
1,Not historically accurate,"Ordinarily I would give this book at least 2 stars, because it is somewhat well-written. However, these books of the American Girls Collection are supposed to offer young children a glimpse of life in their specific time period, and as such they fail miserably when they aren't historically accurate. This story deals with a young girl who wants to keep the Swedish tradition of St. Lucia alive in her family even after they move to America. Trouble is, this story takes place in 1854, and the St. Lucia celebration didn't start until the early 1900's. How can you give kids an accurate picture of the past when the entire plot centers around something that didn't yet exist?"
4,Absolutly adorable!,"This was by far the cutest this my daughter has ever worn. She wore it for her 2nd Halloween and was about 18 months old. We went to an activity center with family and had a professional photographer ask us if we would allow our daughter to be a model for her. That is how adorable this costume is! And it survived the full day and a couple times around the house without falling apart. The only problem was that the wings were uncomfortable, so they were not worn the whole time."
5,More than you expect,"This book has achieved suprisingly long-lived popularity among my two kids, who are now ages 6 and 4. They've enjoyed this book on and off for years. While other books will get some attention and then are dropped, this is one they seem to keep coming back to.Though it's only 10 pages, there's a lot here: shapes, colors, numbers, letter and basic nursery rhymes. The kids love the tactical fun of the lift-a-flap discoveries, and that's a good way for them to learn."
4,Clifford is Wonderful,"Clifford is a wonderful children's character. Before Clifford was a Big Red Dog, he was a small red puppy. This is a good book for 3-100. It is about a big red dog that went to live with a girl named Emily Elizabeth who raised him and showed Clifford how to have a big heart. I think this book is wonderful for kids while learning to read.I loved this book when I was 3 years old and I still love it and now I am 12. I just think that it is a fun book to read because it feels like you are with Clifford when he goes on his adventures. My favorite book of the ones that Bridwell has written is definitely Clifford's Schoolhouse. I just love the pictures and the flaps to the book. It comes in hard cover and paperback.I really hope that my book review helped. I hope that you will buy this book for your child. I promise you they will like it for years to come.- Vic Wharton"
2,sort of Toyah,"Purchase the Changeling or Anthem before you deal with this modern Toyah. I hate drum machines and mind-less tapeloops. I don't mind the new format, except that it's annoying, empty, and not very expressive, except for Tone Poem."
2,Broke after 6 months,It broke after 6 months. I now don't role the window up and down without helping it with my hands. The metal was the same thickness as original equipment. It sounds like the gear inside stripped.
3,Mixed Reviews,"We bought this and the Dora bed for our 3 year old twin daughters while at Grandma's. They loved the look and design, and I will say it is very easy to inflate and deflate. Neither of the girls can get comfortable nor sleep well in these beds. After one night, both beds were almost deflated. By the middle of the night, one or both girls are in bed with us. We have put these beds away in hope that next year they may work."
5,Don't be put off by their name...it's excellent!,"I was curious about this one for quite some time, but was put off by the name...which immediately conjurs upimages of stupid twee songs about elves and other hippy silliness. Ah, but what a pleasant surprise was in storefor me! Fantastic melodic psych in the spirit of The Zombies ""Odessey and Oracle"". This one will really grow on you.According to an interview in ""Ugly Things"" magazine, they were really called the Rahgoos when this LP was recorded,and for the majority of their existence as well. So forget all that wizard nonsense anyhow...."
3,Lacks an extensive analysis of the scores,"There is in the most of the book an dissertative speech on piano playing, but few real scores, and just microscopical passages in the Chopin Estudes. If you want to submerge in the Estudes, buy the real scores, then there are several other books on the dynamics of playing it."
3,The Heartwarming Story of Chester County,"The heartwarming story of how an observant hat with face and limbs survived for hundreds of years, watching a spread of land around the Turk's Head tavern mature into the mighty West Chester, PA of today (that is, circa 1960). The story is told episodically, a la Virginia Woolf's Orlando, as the hat is passed from heir to heir. For some years after the book was published, a replica of the hat (with cartoon face and arms and legs, as in the illustrations) hung on a peg in the Turk's Head Inn in West Chester. The suggestion was that someone had taken an heirloom 17th century chapeau and defaced it in order to make it cute."
2,Poor client service (think Sunrocket quality). Phone is good product.,"Did not work that well for me: the setup gave issues with the online website. Client service only responded once with promise to have tech expert call back. Never did. Still waiting, after 2 weeks, for answers to online queries and you get parked in 'hold' limbo when you call.The monthly plans are not good at all and YOU CANNOT REMOVE THEM once you sign up. the only way is client service, but they do not answer the phone nor the mails.Lastly: the connections have been hit and miss. Tried QoS on router but did not really help. Do not think it is my DSL since I use that with no problems for video conferencing and XBOX Live.Anyways, nice looking phone, but they are not ready to support it.This can only get worse now that they are throwing the phones online for bargain prices: spike in bandwidth, overwhelmed support. Bad bad."
1,Horrible Joip service,"Amber light was blinking continuously so tried contacting joip customer service. Looks like there is no way I can reach them.Sent email at support@joip.com, but it bounced back. Called their 1-800 number which is just a recorded message.I reset the device a couple of times, but still the same amber blinking light.No other choice except returning it.very much disappointed."
3,good product but not what I thought,"Good phone from technical perspective but it was unclear from descriptive on-line literature that the P-to-P internet capability was only for proprietary system contracted out by Panasonic. Since I didn't expect nor desire to be limited to a proprietary system, I did not get what I thought I had ordered. Not sure this is the fault of ignorance and insufficient research on my part or deliberate obfuscation by Panasonic."
4,Nice phone so far.,"It's a nice phone so far - no complaints.Sorry, didn't try to activate Globalrange feature yet..."
2,I didn't like the sound quality for the land line,"I dodn't like the sound quality for the landline. Never used it for internet line, because I already have Vonage (internet phone).Finally I bought another Panasonic KX-TG1033S which sounds much better with landline.Otherwise, the system seemed fine."
2,"Such a promising phone, but...","This phone has such promise as a dual mode phone, but...BIG but...IP battery life is less than 1 hourWhen I use the TEL, if I'm on a call for more than 30 minutes, the handset reboots. This is unacceptable...but if you use this phone for business, that's really unacceptable.Today I was on a TEL call and the battery dropped to 1 bar and rebooted while I was presenting to a customer!Called Panasonic technical support. Apparently, there must be only 1 person who knows this product, because they are never available and never call me back."
1,Never arrived,"Ordered phones. Waited a month. Received notice that phones ""were out of stock"" and a credit card refund. So, never received phones. How do you rate that?"
3,These sheets were awright....,"The sheets were just alright for the price. They did wrinkle pretty bad once washed, but still good enough for a spare bedroom."
2,Dont Buy,"The sheet gets crumpled very fast and then it gives an impression that it is very dirty. The sheet looks great brand new but after a single wash, comes the task of ironing it or it looks wrinkled and dirty."
5,Very nice,"I was very pleased with these sheets. I like the color, the feel, the price, everything. Plus my mattress is one of those thick pillow top mattresses, so I have to be careful about buying sheets that will fit that extra height. These fit perfectly."
3,Nice fabric but....,"I like these sheets, esp good price, but the color is strange, definitely more champagne than Ivory. And the seams were poorly sewn. One has already opened up on a pillowcase. But the fabric feels nice. I've only washed them and used them once so far, so I can't attest to their durability."
1,Sheet set with 4 holes!!,"Got the sheet set today and washed it. I found FOUR holes, at the size of around 1X1 mm each, on the flat sheet. It was really ulgy because the holes were around the center line of the sheet. I requested a return online just now."
3,Interesting,"Didn't know what to expect for this story was kind of new to me. I had heard of Lonnie a few years ago, but the story presented here is a bit strange. I'm not sure if believing everything said in this film. I should know what the other parts have to say about it, like Chuck Smith and John Wimber, and not only phrases that were, maybe, took out of its context. Anyway, it's interesting to know how God could use a person like Lonnie."
4,Step Back,"I must point out that one needs to back up a little and view this account from a larger scale. Lonnie's life, unfortunately, is always viewed from the prism of a ""timeline"". (ie He began this way, he was used that way, he was ill treated another way, he died on the way)--most good documentaries are edited that way. But the reality is, God does not see us as a timeline. Rather, God looks at our lives based on two criteria, 1)amount of revelation given and 2)what we did with that amount of revelation. Lonnie was given a hefty dose, no doubt. But God will not judge or apply reward according to post-Jesus Movement decisions, where he slid backward, or how he died. But rather, will judge according to his life as a whole and all things considered therein. It really is not up to us to come to conclusions about Lonnie, Smith, or Wimbur... but rather to keep our eyes on the Prize before us, lest we look back and miss it."
1,Boring. Do Not Waste Your Money!,"My son already counts and recognizes numbers. But I bought this for a plane trip, thinking it would be entertaining, and it was the worst purchase I've made from Amazon. It's probably the most boring counting DVD out there. It says for ages 2 and up but if your child is a typical active 2 yr old, this will bore him/her to tears. It's very repetitive with boring graphics and sound. Don't be fooled by the description, it is not interactive at all. My 2.5 yo really likes the Richard Scarry Counting video. Old, but well done and much more effective in actually teaching counting."
5,Dean King's books are among the classics,"Dean King's books are among the classics. Dean King was written biographies of extra-ordinary people that are well-known, yetare not known, at all. Patrick O'Brian and Captain James Riley are two leaders in their own worlds, yet their paths never crossed.Dean King, the extra-ordinary man that he is, had the perception and insight to recognize extra-ordinary traits in O'Brian and Riley, and write their biographies.Once a true reader of good literature reads Dean King, he will become a reader for the long run."
2,Well Written Gossip,"Although well researched, given the elusive nature of his subject, the book bordered on the tedious at times, especially in the reprinting of large passages from POB's works. Designed to offer Dean's readers an insight into some of POB's actions, they inevitably ended up being more speculative than insightful. I also felt that much of the book was based on gossip and hearsay, again probably inevitably, but one felt ocassionally uncomfortably intrusive touching on so many irrelevancies. Basically, the book lacked grace."
3,Patrick O'Brian; A Life Revealed?,"Given Mr. O'Brian's reticence and the dearth of other primary source material, perhaps Mr. King was overeaching in even attempting this biography. The ending was particularly dissatisfying. Mr. King clearly meant to publish this biography during Mr. O'Brian's life and indeed the research seems to virtually end after the publication of ""The Yellow Admiral"". The book would have greatly benifited from delaying publication until a more satisfying conclusion could be reached. Certainly Mr. King was walking a fine line, trying not to tell a tale of embittered relatives and trying to pay homage to a great author. I respect his efforts but Mr. King leaves as many loose ends as Mr. O'Brian leaves after ""Blue at the Mizzen"".It was certainly enjoyable to read aboout Mr. O'Brian who most of us know so little about except through his work; just as he would want it."
5,even with a few FLAWS...the bonus VIDEO content is AMAZING!!!,"As another reviewer so well noted...its not the ""reference"" DVD Audio...a format which never really took hold anyway. The reason for my 5 stars? First ...it IS Frampton Comes Alive...arguably one of the greatest live albums of all time...but for me...the BONUS VIDEO footage is the time capsule priceless stuff that will have me clutching this close and refusing to sell at any price!!"
4,Power Grooves.,"Well. It's Dave Lombardo, so it's going to be good. I wish it had some Slayer examples, but you can figure out what he is doing on those records on your own. PLAYING it might be a different story though. This is a good guide for coming up with different grooves and parts. It touches on warming up, a brief section on odd times, and the importance of solid playing. There is a cd which has audio of all of the examples in the book. It also has versions of Grip Inc. songs with and without drums(so you can play along). If you are a fan of metal and rock drumming, then you should like this book."
2,Not a great book,There is nothing of interest here. Nothing about slayer and no songs from them. The beats are boring and there was not anything about this book that made it stand out when reading it. Buy something else this book is disappointing.
1,"""Hard"" case? I think not.","This was not an impressive product. It does provide some protection for the telescope, but it is cheaply made. The case is of thin aluminum with plastic corners holding it all together. My case arrived with a cracked corner, so it would not shut properly after being opened the first time. The foam is not properly cut for the accessories, so they fit in poorly. The telescope itself will not fit in the precut slot unless you fully rotate the focus in. This requires you turn the tiny focus knob on the 'scope about 30 times to store it and another 30 times to make the telescope useable again the next time you take it out. Overall I was pretty disappointed with the case, but it does at least give me a way to move the telescope around without damage, though I was hoping for something more substantial based on the picture of the product, showing metal construction. If I could have found the rucksack Meade makes for the telescope sold outside of a kit, I would have rather had that."
3,Ok but not as good as,"This is an ok biography but not as good as Epicurian Delight or Beards own autobiography ""Delights and Predudices"". His homosexulity is some what white washed and the tone is a little bitter."
3,"Not bad, could be better","This DVD would have been excellent if the background music hadn't been as loud as it is. Because the background music is so loud, it is difficult to hear the sounds of the letters as they are being pronounced."
2,be careful of this manual,I expected a complete chilton manual. I have a v6 lebaron. There is nothing in the title or review that lets you know the manual is for the 4 cylinder engines only. When I received the manual and the title is 1981-1995 4 cylinder cars I was disgusted with my useless purchase.
3,I learned a lot!,"Generally not a fan of the ""...for Dummies"" books because I think that they simplify things too much, but I have to admit that I learned a lot from this book. Every summer I try to grow my own herbs, and sometimes I have success and sometimes I do not. Herbs can be very nutritious when combined in dishes, and for someone like me who likes to cook, I found this book will surely be a good reference when it starts to warm up! This book really helped me to understand why some things that I grow don't succeed while others do. I also really liked the section about where the various herbs come from (didn't know that aloe was part of the onion family). Always love a book that can teach me something new. Pretty decent publication!"
3,For someone interested in casual use,"This book is a good resource and has info on making tinctures, and some herbs in it... but it's not comprehensive. For instance it doesn't include all flowers that have medicinal qualities (nothing about echinacea for example) it doesn't have very many pictures which is to be expected from a ""for dummies"" book. Overall, it's a good place to start but I really liked ""Homegrown Herbs"" by Tammi Hartrung much better and is probably why I rated this book lower. ""Homegrown Herbs"" has tons of color photos and so much info not only on almost all herbs but also on lots of ideas on what to do with them along with theme gardens, harvesting tools, and much more. ""Herb Gardening for Dummies"" does have a lot of info, with ideas on how to use herbs and a good base on how to grow them but I just liked the layout of other book I mentioned better."
4,Great Herb Book for the Beginner,"Herb Gardening for Dummies is the kind of book I wish I had when I started herb gardening. It takes you step by step as to what herbs you should consider planting, the basic uses, preparing the soil, container gardens and understanding your growing climate.I love their uses section, including recipes for food, health and beauty, remedy and other items."
4,Herb Garden Intro,"I love any ""Dummies"" Herb intro book along with a complete reference. This ""Dummies"" selection is a beginners to intermediate book. This is a place to start. I use ""Dummies"" books as quick-start guides. They give you a sprinkling of essentials you need to know about the given topic, and in a quick-witted way.There is some caution used in this book about pests, insecticides, but most of it is pure joy. There are recipes too, as well as info on what herbs are and what herbs there are.In the 90's I used a lot of ""Quick Start"" books that I used for Web Development, Animation, Programming. As learning with those books, this book kind of takes you through various exercises to create an herb garden. This isn't a know-all, do-all book, but for a beginner, this is the perfect introduction."
1,The Deerslayer,The video is excellent but the tape quality poor. There is a wear mark across the middle of the screen throughout the film.
1,far too many errors,"I thought I was going crazy until I realized that this book is full of errors! More than I can count on two hands. If you're looking for a decent LSAT test prep, this is not it!"
2,"For my use it works, but don't use to study.","Right now I'm using 4 different books to prep for my LSAT. I've got the LSAT Kaplin book, which is the one that I'm really using to study. I also have a copy of Kaplin's 180 book, however that is for use in the future. I own a copy of the 10 Prep Tests, that book is very stright forward in it's use. I also have this book put together by the people at Cliffnotes. I use this book for one purpose. I wanted a book that I could use just to use random test questions to solve. I'm going through the tests, but not under any test conditions. There are a handful of bad questions in this book, and as a serious study aid, it can't hold a candle to any of the other ones. But I suspose for my use, it's doing what I wanted."
4,Solid Tour Closer,"This is a very good show. It was the last show of the Spring 2002 tour, and it's a very solid show. The highlight of the show is the spectacular ""Rivertrance"" that closes the first set. It's one of the stronger versions of this song that I've heard.While this show was good, I didn't think it was quite the same caliber as the previous night. If you've read my review of the 4/27 show, you'll know that I felt that particular show was not only the best of the Spring tour, but also the best show that the band has played thus far (through July). The 4/28 show just doesn't have quite the same intensity, but that shouldn't stop you from buying this show. This is still a very good show, and you won't be disappointed."
5,Standard Hollywood,"This is a compilation & as such I find them most difficult to review. However, the jazz is great, so I thought I'd give it a shot. Pepper led a very difficult life involving drugs, jail, etc. & died at 56.About Pepper, Scott Yanow of All Music stated, ""In the 1950s he was one of the few altoists (along with Lee Konitz and Paul Desmond) that was able to develop his own sound despite the dominant influence of Charlie Parker"" and: ""When Art Pepper died at the age of 56, he had attained his goal of becoming the world's great altoist""In any case you'l hear such greats as Bill Watrous,Russ Freeman, Jack Sheldon & many more. I might mention that he played clarinet as well as alto sax.You'll recognize many of the tunes; ""You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To,"" ""My Funny Valentine,"" How High the Moon"" & others. Pepper is a very imaginative soloist with a pure tone & great on ballads.Get this album. You'll enjoy it."
3,As raw as it gets,"Stackwaddy were an English band discovered by Radio One DJ John Peel, who signed them to his own Dandelion label. They delivered gut-level covers with howling vocals reminiscent of Beefheart at his best. All tracks were put down live in the studio, mostly first-takes with no overdubs. The self-titled debut and 'Bugger Off' were released in 1971 and 1972 respectively, and soon became collectors items. Both are included on this CD, but unfortunately their version of 'The Girl From Ipanema' from the second LP has been cut due to lack of space. Otherwise a good package for fans of primal blues rock"
4,Typical Fantasy...,"""Morgon of Hed met the High One's harpist one autumn day when the trade-ships docked at Tol for the season's exchange of goods.""Thus begins a fairly interesting fantasy book. It tells of Morgon, prince of the simple farmers of Hed, who must escape evil forces and journey to the High One on the mysterious Erlenstar Mountain.With him comes Deth, the High One's harper. No one is who they seem and no one can be trusted. Typical fantasy plot, right? This book has the feel of an old fantasy tale too; there is a distinctive writing style throughout the book. Though the book was sort of confusing, for the most part it was a fairly enjoyable read. The Riddle-Master of Hed is the first of three books about the land that Morgon lives in. And the book ends on a cliff-hanger, so now I feel really compelled to read the second book, just to see what happens.*You can read all of my book reviews at my blog, [...]*"
3,Didn't I already read this book ... by LeGuin?,"The book is an enjoyable Young Adult Fantasy novel. However, last year I read the popular ""Wizard of Earthsea"" series by Ursula LeGuin - I felt like it was a rehash of that series. In fact I had to look up the publishing dates of both books to see which came first. Wizard of Earthsea was published a few years before so I'm going to have to assume that was the inspiration for this book.""Imitation is the highest form of flattery"" and it's a formula that worked well - so I don't really mind. I did enjoy reading it and will read the next two. However, I'm hoping I can read the next two books without feeling like I've already read the book."
1,False Advertising,"When you look at the photo it is a package of 300 capsules. When you get to check out, it is only 100."
5,yeah!!!,hav'nt heard it yet but just about to order it!ERIC MARTIN KICKS ARSE! and i'm sure this album will in factKICK ALOT OF ARSE! buy it! all of you! buy it!!!!arrgh.
4,"Good quality, plain shape","The quality of this driftwood is great, it's heavy self sinking malaysian wood which is really nice. The only thing I am disatisfied with is the shape. While it is a natural piece, it has no shape at all, it is a flat stick shape. It is long though, and a couple of inches thick, it just has no design to it. I leaned it up against the wall of the tank, and actually looks pretty good and my fish like it (needed to lower the pH and a few pieces of driftwood are suposed to help) also my pleco needs it for minerals I guess. Looks great with live plants. Overall OK for the price."
4,Make sure you boil this,"I received my Malaysian Driftwood and followed the reviews to boil it first. Actually, If you really want to get rid of the tannins before putting it in your tank I suggest repeated boilings. I was able to use a large stainless steel pot (this prevents staining) and boil the submerged wood for at least 30 minute intervals. Dump the stained water and repeat. It took me 7 procedures before the water was almost clear after boiling. It makes a big difference and avoids clouding the water in your tank."
1,Not for kids!,I bought this for my 15 year old son's birthday. Within 10 minutes he had crashed the helicopter and broken it.
1,"The DVD was difficult to play the movie, had to use the remote and stop and restart",We stopped trying to play the movie. It was too difficult to get to the play menu. It is ridiculous.
4,Speed Racer Comet Run,"Received within several business days. Video was as expected without any unwelcomed surprises. I ordered this video to replace one that had somehow become lost. I am very satisfied with the merchandise, service, and delivery."
3,"Fantastic, but some not nice words used in it that a 3 and 5 yr old should not hear :( Lame, stupid, etc...not good!","This is a great and fun movie, and series for that matter, however although our 3 and 5 yr olds love it, there is langiage in it that we do not approve of (stupid, lame, etc) and they call one another names and model bad behavior too :( That's disappointing, so although our kids LOVE the movies, we now have to limit their viewing time."
2,poor battery,I purchased this phone about 2 years ago and have not been happy with it. The sound is not clear and there is a lot of interference at my house and with other phones I do not have that problem. Also the batteries have not lasted. They do not charge anymore and I have tried all the tricks. I have always been happy with Panasonic products but not this one. Judt not good quality.
4,Store Great - Product So-So,"The company shipped fast, best price I could find, and everything in excellent condition.The phones themselves are a bit lacking in the sound ... although we are using them and they are convenient, easy to hook up, and good range. Still, the sound quality is a bit empty. They do have plenty of volume."
3,Too much noise,"This phone generally works okay if I stay in one place. But when I move away from the base, there is interference, and the caller sporadically cuts out. If you just need an extra, inexpensive phone, this could do, but for call reliability, I would spring for the (unfortunately) more expensive newer DECT phones."
2,Phone Returned,I returned this item unused to Amazon. I did not notice in the item description that this phone set DOES NOT have an intercom function.The return was handled promptly by Amazon
4,"Great music, typical Toy Dolls style!","The songs on this CD are very smart. Everyone, who loves the Toy Dolls will like this CD. Olga is a phantastic guitar player, so if you like sophisticated and technically precisely played solos, you should definitifely buy this album!"
4,If you love Punk...,"You will love this album. The Toy Dolls are one o the more amusing, creative, and crazy punk bands around. The lead singer has always sounded like he overdosed on helium...hard to believe, I know.I have been listening to these guys for over a decade now, and I never get tired of them.This album is worth the money just for the song: ""I'M Gonna Be 500 Miles"""
3,Another Fast Read for the Beach.,"A typical but readbale Sci Fi story that at times is a joy to read but then seems so unrealistic. A group of seismologoists in the Sahara discover a saucer in rock that is dated to just over 100,000 years old (first mistake), and so it goes. If you can avoid the scientific oopps in the story and don't worry about the simple character development, well then you should be able to consume this over a couple of hours."
3,Just For The Fun,"This is not THE FLIGHT OF THE INTRUDER. Get over it. SAUCER is, as one reviewer pointed out, more on the order of Heinlein's earlier works, perhaps a bit juvinile for some people's taste. BUT I LIKED IT! The good guys were undoubtedly good and the bad guys were wonderfully bad. There are no shadows, everything is black and white, the way stories were back when we were younger and more innocent."
3,Standard Fare,"Stephen Coonts has long been associated with that particular genre of writing...the techno-thriller. But his characters have often deviated from the archetype and his story lines are more fresh than many of his contemporaries. His fans know they can expect better quality when they pick up a new Coonts. That's why with SAUCER, he may throw them off.In a very X-Files way, a seismic scientist (the oddly named Rip Cantrell) finds a UFO in the Sahara desert. As is usually the case in this sort of story, several interst groups want the saucer for themselves and Rip finds himself stuck in the middle. Hs only option is...get ready for this...to fly the saucer away.Add a beautiful female test pilot and some pretty standard Libyan military goons and you have SAUCER.Entertaining and fast-paced: yes.Thoughtful and believable: no."
3,Fanciful,"The ""Publishers Weekly"" review hit the nail right on the head: this book is ""a flight of fancy"" and a ""cartoonish slice of escapism"" that is ""more hokey than suspenseful"" and more like Clive Cussler than Tom Clancy.I could hardly say it any better, along with most of the other citizen reviewers on these pages. But if you like the cartoony adventures by Clive Cussler, you'll probably enjoy this book also. This is NOT serious science fiction, nor suspense, nor mystery/thriller (which is where it was shelved at the bookstore); and apparently this style of story is a departure from Coonts' techno-thrillers. Which is a relief to me. This was my first Coonts book and it was terribly disappointing because I was expecting something else. If I had read these reviews first and was expecting a Cussler-esque story, I think I would have enjoyed it much more."
3,Boys own adventure story,"Stephen Coonts has in the Grafton Carmellini stories, some of the best high tech adventure stories available. Blending the worlds of navy aviation, espionage and a good chunk of James Bond style escapism they're multi layered, well plotted with a caste of believable well rounded characters.Unfortunately Coonts attempts to spread his wings from his occasional flights of high tech fancy to more overt Sci Fi is rather less successful. The characters are all shallow and clichéd. The stereotypes used for the foreign nationals, particularly the French are just laughable. the plot is linear and the complexities usually found in a Coonts story are just not there. If you want a slightly gung ho shoot em up story that has more than a passing nod to the movie Independence day, then it's fine. If you want a Stephen Coonts book, then you'll probably come away disappointed."
2,Meant for kids?,"Like other reviewers here, I've enjoyed Coonts' other books. This one, however, feels like it was written by somebody else. Its plot and characters are very shallow. The dialog is silly and cliche. The book seems to be written for younger readers -- except for the occasional and unnecessary obscenity. If you want a great Coonts book, try Cuba."
1,Stunningly horrid!,"Honestly, one of the worst stories I've ever read. I just wrote a particularly lengthy and scathing review of this book, but it was accidentally deleted. I don't feel that this story deserves any more of the time it would take me to re-write it. If I could give it less then one star, I would. Just please, please take my advice. Stay away from this book!"
2,Like A Bad Made For Cable TV Movie,"The PW review used ""hokey"" and ""cartoonish"" to describe this book and I couldn't agree more. Think of every low budget, made-for-cable-TV movie you've ever seen, starring your typical B-level actors and you've got this book. If the author was going for campy, he failed."
1,Pathetic,"Saucer is a waste of the paper it's printed on. The wooden dialogue is enough to not recommend the book, but that's just one of the (many) reasons. If you really feel you have to throw away several hours of your life reading this drivel, check it out at your local library so you're not actually wasting any money on it. Better yet, just pass on this one. It really is that bad."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"When a UFO is discovered by a team of researchers, they have to decide what to do with it. The rest of the world, of course, wants to get their hands on this piece of technology, so this is likely to get dangerous.Eventually, they decide to take it out of everybody's hands."
3,Only for a sci-fi fan...,"Being a fan of science fiction novels, I enjoyed this book. It was interesting to see the author's depiction of future technology and theories of space travel. Although, I found that Coonts' writing style was, needless to say, weak and predictable. I was turned off by the stereotypical and overused aspects of his characters and plot. Beyond that, there were several points of the novel that were slow and not very exciting. It seemed to me, that considering the subject matter, the plot could have been much more entertaining. I would recommend it to other readers who enjoy science fiction novels. But for those who don't usually read these kinds of books, don't be in any hurry to read this one."
2,Read something else,"Yesterday I finished re-reading ""Saucer"" by Stephen Coonts. It is every bit as infantile and silly as I recalled from my first reading. It is not ""bad writing:"" it's just pointless and not-worth-reading. It is an intellectual slumber pill; it is mind-pausing escapist literature. One's time could be much better spent reading one of many other books. The book has George W Bush as president of the United States, though he is thinly disguised--- he is as much an incompetent violence-solves-it idiot in the book as well as in real life. The book's science is also pure fantasy of course (well, it is fiction after all!), yet still annoying: one of the characters ""discovered"" that humans did not evolve on Earth, despite the convincing and conclusive evidence to the contrary."
1,Just dumb. Plain dumb. Very disappointing.,"I started reading this with great enthusiasm, envisioning the twists and turns that Coonts could create with the basic premise of an ancient flying saucer found buried in the Saharan sands. And what I got was a screenplay for a summer blockbuster, devoid of any complexity or depth whatsoever.I read the first 30-40 pages, skimmed the next 40, and flipped through the rest of the book before finally abandoning it altogether. Oh well."
2,Should've been better...,"I've read other books by Stephen Coonts, all of which I thoroughly enjoyed. The premise of this book sounded interesting, so I bought. I'm sorry I did. I'm particularly upset because I know, having read other books by this author, that he could've done a much better job. It's like he wrote the thing in a few days. The plot could've been sharpened, the characters fleshed out, and that ""love story"" was just silly. I'm still a fan, but I feel cheated having spent [money] on this silly book."
3,Fun,"Saucer isn't ground breaking, but in some ways it appeals to the kid inside me who always wanted to discover some hidden treasure that would launch me into adventure. In Saucer, that's just what happens. The ""hero"", Rip Cantrell, finds a flying saucer sticking out of a rock in the Sahara. He and his coworkers extract the Saucer from the rock, and surprise, it's in perfect working order. Rip and his new found friend Charley Pine set out on an adventure, chased by the Libyans, the US government, and the 2nd richest man in the world--an Australian businessman. The plot progresses through several crisis, but in the end, good triumphs over evil and Rip and Charley save the day. Don't read this book looking for a critically acclaimed masterpiece. Instead, read this book for the fun of it, and for the vicarious adventure you missed as a kid."
1,Disgusted reader,"This book is horribly written with limp, poorly developed characters. I can't believe that an editor let this thing get printed. I read about 40 pages of it and threw it away -- it was that bad. Not only was the plot a real stretch, but the dialogue, the action and the overall feel of the writing was that it was written by someone who's never written a novel before. I wouldn't want my name associated with it."
1,"""Saucer"" is a stinker","I was so excited to find a book like this on the shelves! I had very high hopes for it, and had heard great things about the author. I could not even get halfway through the book, though, before adding it to the pile to go back to my used book store. Ugh! This book reads like it was written by a juvenile. In this case, do NOT judge a book by it's cover - pass this one up...unless you need good kindling for a fire. Even then, don't spend good money on it!"
1,Simplistic Plot,"I was most disappointed in this book. The plot was easily discernable from the beginning. And to top it off, his characterizations and descriptions were very poorly drawn. I ended up not caring about what happened to any of them. I find books on UFO's fascinating so it certainly wasn't the premise that turned me off."
2,Saucer - A Stephen Coonts failure,"I spend 20 hours a week in dialysis. Reading material helps pass the time away, and this is about all Saucer can do. The writing is amateaurish, the characters are paper dolls. While the main characters carry the plot, the romance is elementary school. In all the book was a short poorly developed story, much more could have been done with the premise. For a quick adventure it is worth the price but it would not be worth a second read."
4,"Great ""Saucer, The Conquest"" Prequel","Stephen Coonts' experience as an U.S. Naval combat aviator shines in this fun and fanciful sci-fi novel. The actual star of the story is not Rip nor Charlie - but the saucer itself. The characters are a bit surreal - but once you get past that, the story is extremely enjoyable (after all, science fiction has a great deal of fantasy woven throughout the plausible). The character I enjoy most is Rip's uncle Egg, which you won't meet until the middle of the novel. Sit back with a good cup of joe and enjoy a great read - then read Stephen Coonts' sequel, ""Saucer, The Conquest."" The following is directed to Stephen Coonts: Please finish the story regarding the mother ship found off the Great Barrier Reef. It could make for a great trilogy."
1,"""Not The Standard I Expect From Coonts""","I've been a big Stephen Coonts fan for years. He has written some terrific books like ""The Red Horseman"" and ""Under Seige."" Unfortunately, ""Saucer"" wasn't up to his usual snuff. I liked the premise, but the characters seemed flat and the dialogue rather unnatural. There wasn't a lot of inner thought to really bring out the characters and strengthen the story. I still think Coonts is an awesome writer, but even Barry Bonds strikes out every so often."
3,Fun Book But...,"Saucer was my first Stephen Coonts book. I admit to being a sucker for science fiction and I was looking for a diversion. Saucer gave me my money's worth, barely. Mr. Coonts won't be on the top of my list when I buy my next science fiction book.The book is basically a chase story. The science fiction was short on science. The political intrigue was pretty lame. And the evil businessman was simply unbelievable. The chase was pretty good and sort of fun.This is a book I wish I'd read 40 years ago when I was a kid. I would have liked it a lot more."
2,Meant for kids?,"Like other reviewers here, I've enjoyed Coonts' other books. This one, however, feels like it was written by somebody else. Its plot and characters are very shallow. The book seems to be written for younger readers, although it doesn't specifically say so. If you want a great Coonts book, try <I>Cuba</I>."
2,Saucer not the best,This is the first Stephen Coonts book I have read. I thought the science behind the saucer was a bit simplistic. The way the ship was powered left a lot to be desired(water & nuclear?).The characters were also drawn very basic. The people were black and white and no shades of gray. It is a very quick read and you should be through it before you start gagging.
2,It could have been soooo much more!,"I am an avid Coonts fan, but was disappointed with this book. The story had such promise, but didn't live up to its potential."
2,I bought this by mistake...I saw Coonts and thought Koontz,"Not worth time or money. Look onward for your next reading material...I bought the audio version, listened to it in my car and threw it away as soon as I finished. The only reason I listened was the obvious one...I had nothing else in the car."
4,Saucer: An Adventure,"I chose this book because I have enjoyed other books by Stephen Coonts. Although this is a different book from his usual, I found it to be fast and easily read, and very entertaining. I strongly recommend it for those times when one needs a light happy escape."
4,This is a juvenile!,"Coonts must have dug into the trunk for this book. Grab a bag of peanuts, a cold brew, and sink into your easy chair and wish you were 14 years old again. Heinlein wrote juveniles and no one knocked him when he did -- but they were marketed as juvies. This book isn't. When I picked it up, I thought it would be a favorite author's foray into a different genre. It was! And Heinlein would be proud! This is a raygun and rocketship juvenile and it is delightful if you don't read it with adult sensitivities. Of course it doesn't always make sense! Of course it's not always coherent! And the science... ah... Hey, it's one heck of an entertaining read if you know and appreciate the genre. Buy and enjoy! And if you have a fourteen year old nephew, sneak it to him. He'll be hooked on SF for the rest of his life."
2,Good Writer's Not so Good Book,"I like Mr. Coonts works. Let me get that out first. However, this one has a great premise that falls flat. No, splat. Ancient Saucer. Advanced Tech. Flying. International action. Interesting character roster. Then it goes wrong. There is no suspense or wonder. You just don't care about the cast. And the names drive you nuts! Always a bad sign. When the major Yoda figure is called ""Egg"", please. This sounds to me like an outline for the publisher which then had to be written under contract. Slow down, Mr. Coonts."
1,Awful,I read the first 40 or so pages and I can not believe how bad this book is. The reviewers giving one star below have it right. This book reads like it was written by a junior high school student. Don't waste your time or money.
4,Not for the serious,"Did you ever wish you had your own flying saucer, and nobody else had one like it? What would you do? How about buzz a baseball field? Take your favorite uncle for a ride into space? Pose for pictures for the locals?Most of the people who read and enjoyed this book seemed to understand that it is simply a fun read. If you are into hard science fiction, forget it. If you want it to make sense, forget it. Just take a deep breath and jump in with the attitude of going to an action movie. This is a book to take to the beach house and leave for the next person. No romance, no sex, no profanity, some over-the-top violence. I thought it was great!"
2,Disappointing,"I read, enjoyed, and own every book that Stephen Coontz has written. Until I read this one! This is Not his style of writing, in fact the plot and style are almost juvenile.. The story is there, the development is weak and almost childish."
2,a disappointment,"SAUCER was very disappointing--the name Coonts should guarantee more at this stage. While starting out showing promise, it soon devolves into implausibility and the cartoon characters are unable to rescue the material. This light-hearted romp takes no notice of the likelihood that the fight for possession of the world-changing technology at stake could easily lead to WW3. How that event was avoided could have been the basis for a thoughtful, suspenseful story. Unfortunately, that is not the story that was written."

4,Entertaining Story/Clever Plot Devices,"As the day, November 1, 1993, progresses from dawn to dusk, so do the lives of the characters beginning with the births of the principal characters, Hazel and Spencer. Strangely, all events in the story occur on that date. But the story does not follow a straightline progression but parallel courses (just like the characters' lives), because Beard switches cleverly from pivotal past events of each character's life (except for one) back to the present until the story's climax at which time all the lives intersect. This device enables us to watch the characters' lives develop so we can learn how they got to the present (and their current predicaments). Ultimately I found each character sympathetic.Overall, this is a book of effective, entertaining writing that enabled me to ignore a muggy gray Saturday."
3,Mods of the World Unite!,"Ever wonder what the mod revival movement wasall about? Here is your chance to find out. The Merton Parkas (the name's a pun if you know London) featured a chap named Mick Talbot on keyboards -- he went on to fame and fortune with the Style Council.Check out their spirited cover of mod classics such as Smokey Robinson's ""Tears of a Clown"". You'll also get to sample several tracks by the unheralded Squire (not Billy!). If you have a scooter and some skinny ties, this could be a key album for you."
5,GR8!!!,"not only did they make a wonderful centerpiece for my cupcakes, but the children loved them!!! i still have a bundle of them all over the house, my little girl calls it her ""ring ring"". they are pretty and well built, not cheap at all. you have to buy!!"
4,"Cheap, cute decoration and favor","Used this for my daughter's 4th birthday. They were a big hit with the girls - spruced up the cupcakes and made a nice little favor to take home. The rings were too big for little fingers, but still a hit."
3,"Story of the holy grail, as told by a novelist.","Costain is known for his Bible based works of historical fiction. The Silver Chalice is one of his best known works.Following the trail of the legendary cup, the story has all the flourishes of any other historical novel.Truly a nice clean version of the Grail legend."
2,What a disappointment,"I had good expectations about this book. And I was disappointed.The plot is weak, full of flaws. The characters are shallow, without consistency, feeling like a mixture of real people and cardboard figures. Sometimes I got annoyed with their silly or undeveloped behavior.The story goes on and on, with some characters introduced you don't know why or what for, and then disappearing.I gave this book two stars only because around 30% of it was a reasonably good reading, and 10% a very good reading. But if you consider this book has more than 800 hundred pages, you realize there are long uninspiring stretches.Now I don't know if I'm brave enough to read other books by this author, in spite of all the praise given to him by some other reviewers. His daughter Molly Costain Haycraft, however, wrote a nice historical fiction,My Lord Brother the Lion Heart."
3,Religious Fiction,"This book gives you an inside view of the Luke and Paul and the other apostles as they struggle to give Jesus' church life. It talks about the danger they were in and the predjudice they faced. I read it before an exam in religion to help me understand the new testament better...it worked! The story follows a young man who was illegally enslaved and then had his freedom purchased by Luke so that he could produce a silver chalice with the likeness of all of the prophets. In order to do so he has to travel around to their lectures and speeches, stay in their homes and become friends with them. It is very insightful. A nice long book, that should keep you busy for quite a few hours of reading time."
2,good picture; however...,"Saw first 30 minutes waiting for this movie to take off with some excitement, drama or comedy.. Not wasting 2 hours on this"
1,Horrible,"DVD is absolutely horrible. DVD scratched, freezes does not play and was copied. Not in the original box. I was duped."
5,Beautifully filmed introduction to Paul's travels,"This overview of Paul's travels is beautifully and lovingly made with many fascinating glimpses into the Biblical world through visits to early Christian churches and archeological sites that have been excavated and carefully preserved.Ideal for an adult Bible study, this DVD gives the viewer a much better understanding of the social and cultural background of the cities in which Paul preached.The accompanying text is intended for a broad Christian audience that has read some or all of Paul's letters."
2,Dull Paul,"The narration is ponderous, dull and lifeless. Missing is any discussion of the debates of the meaning of Jesus' life and mission that must have been alive at the time. What issues did Paul face and how did his writings and teachings attempt to resolve them? What pressures did he face from the Romans, the Jewish hierachy and ordinary people who had different understandings of Jesus? None of this is discussed in the depth required to understand the origins of Christianity."
3,apostle Paul,it is okay but it lacks some specificity with regard to Pauls'. mission content and detail withregard to conflict with James and Peter.
1,Are you kidding?,"Fatuous, sentimental. Couldn't finish it because of those characteristics. Even for free it would be a rip off. Why should I have to say more?"
4,Brief About This Book,"Overall the book is good from a scholastic pont of view , delivers its strength in projects. Lacking in the important OUTLOOK feature of Office 2000 which is widely in use these days. The projects are nicely covered with visuals and good for beginers and internediate level learners."
4,Great swing workout,"After a few years absence due to health issues I finally was able to get back to using my kettlebells. I have a lot of workouts, paper and otherwise, but sometimes do not feel like counting and some of the DVDs I have are too varied. Sometimes you just want to swing, put in the time and effort, and get the results--this workout does that. It's not intended to be an instructional DVD (Tracy and Mark have others for perfecting swing form). The count *I* felt was easy to follow. There is no music so you can easily use what you want that day. I like only having to focus on the basics because in my experience THAT'S what gets you results. WTG Tracy and I look forward to new offerings in 2013!"
1,Dreadfully boring,"I had some interest in this initially after reading The Swing book. However, in working out with the DVD it becomes very monotonous after the second time. I have done workouts of other trainers with a range of different excercises which keeps your interest. I disagree with Traci that just swinging is enough. Her workout doesn't give you a good feeling of working the abs or back muscles. Her sets feel silly like a grade schooler had fun trying out different number combinations for swinging. Just not enough substance here."
1,great content horrible quality media,"While the content is good on this DVD, I had numerousissues with the disc itself. Initially the disc that Ireceived had no data/content. I contacted the seller andthey said there had been a batch of blank discs and theysent out another quickly. Then after roughly 10 plays ofthe disc, it has gone into non-play mode. Disc is inpristine condition cosmetically but all 3 of the playersI've tried it on will no longer recognize the disc and theseller won't respond to my concerns. I guess I won't bebuying any offerings from this seller again."
4,Serious and ideological movie,"Had great pleasure in enjoying the original track. The story is long, maybe bewildering for who does not know anything about Italian angst. The contrast between two sons and their place in their immediate family is very well portrayed as well as is their interaction between themselves and their common interest. Their family ties are strong but in the end their personal demons decide their fate."
2,Italian overblown drivel,"Being Italian and having been raised on the Italian greats such asAntonioni, Fellini, Bertolucci etc. and having grown up watching someof the greatest actors ever to grace Italy's screen, I can safely saythat this is a piece of current clichéd Italian drivel, with overtlymelodramatic acting and soap operatic story line. It is baffling how acountry with such rich cinematic history is now turning out actors ofsuch subpar quality which can only be compared to the worst acting onAmerican soaps. I understand that there is a new acting school in Romefrom which they all graduate, and it shows. Unwatchable.Having said that I do have to point out that the scope of the film does give a very good insight on socio political events spanning the decades bewteen the late 60's through early 90's in Italian history."
5,outstanding!,"This is an amazing journey through human feelings, politics and history. Through the specificity of the Italian setting, it reach a much wider audience and a wider range of experiences. The actors are excellent, and the screenplay is outstanding."
5,An Excellent Journey,"I stumbled on this film at 11:30PM last night on one of my cable stations and was TRANSFIXED for next the SIX hours as it captivated not only my attention but my heart.What a saga...what interesting characters and portrayals...everyone casted was suberb and provided an endearing and haunting glimpse into the saga of this family over time.I am exhausted from the unexpected all nighter...but first thing set out to own this film on DVD and watch it again, and again to explore even more of the nuances. Watch it, share it, own it.....it is a film masterpiece."
5,The Best of Youth,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this epic of real Italian life.the storyline and acting was accurate, believable and absorbing.We watched the first DVD and ate dinner and discussed it thoroughly and impatiently rushed to watch the second half. Happy to report the ending was pleasing....really did not want a sad ending with this movie.It really depicted Italian life, feelings, family and love.Highly recommend it.."
5,THE BEST !!!,"Without a doubt, this was the BEST movie I have ever seen. I hated when its six-plus hours came to an end. ""The Best of Youth"" engaged every emotion in my repertoire without resorting to silly games.I have recommended this to so many people, and loaned out my copy about 10 times. I am so glad I bought it, so I can watch it over and over.This is not to be missed! Fine writing, outstanding acting, gorgeous settings and scenery. Well done in every respect."
5,Pure Class,"Undoutedly one of the finest films ever made. Its epic in length and intimate in nature. Over 6 hours of film we explore life like never before in cinema, different personalities set off into the world and how they each deal with the trials and obstacles that life can throw up.A fascinating watch."
4,Highly recommended,"Ignore the awful strapline on the cover ('Passion and adventure under the Italian Sun', yuk!), Marco Giordana's film is serious cinema. Like a contemporary 'Rocco e sui Fratelli' or even an Italian 'Heimat', Best of Youth follows the lives of two brothers and their friends and families from the 60's to the present against a background of key events in Italian history (Venice flood, Mafia trails, Red Brigade etc). Performances are superb throughout. Paticularly Luigi Lo Cascio (Nicola). Although maybe a few too many loose ends are are tied up at the end to earn it 5 stars, it's an epic tale well told, and well worth 6 hours of your time."
5,WOW..... WHAT A WONDERFUL MOVIE!,"An absolute masterpiece. Seamless casting, directing, editing, soundtracking, settings and performance. So profound yet so down-to-earth up close and personal. This movie should get an Oscar not just an award from Cannes. The story and all the characters simply grow on you. A story you just don't want it to end but, gratefully it ended wonderfully perfect. Every character and role in this movie is so likable. Watch it and enjoy it. DON'T MISS IT!"
5,6-hours Deep,"Most of you interested in watching this film will shy away because of it's 6-hrs running time. But once you start watching this great masterpiece from Italy, you'll forget about time and won't think of this film as 6 hours long but 6 hours deep. Because of it's length, the film takes us through this novel-like story where unpredictable circumstances happen to the characters and the story. After watching this film, other great films might seem like short stories while this a novel. It is simply amazing to watch a film and care the same for every character in the film, the cast was superb in this film. If you love movies, and don't simply watch movies for entertainment but also for their art then this movie is highly recommended."
5,"Yes, it really is that good","You can read the other 5-star reviews here on Amazon to get a detailed sense of what's so special about The Best of Youth. I just want to verify that yes, this film really is as good as those reviewers would have you believe. It's one of those rare films that feels not like an artificial construction but like a document of real life, and you come out of it feeling as though you've lived that experience for yourself. It's the kind of film that makes you want to accost strangers in the street and persuade them to watch it, just so you can share the joy and wonder of it. I actually haven't viewed it on DVD (though I do own it); I paid to see it in the theater as two separate 3-hour films on two separate occasions, which should tell you just how much of an impression it made on me.Stop reading the reviews and just see the film, now. You won't regret it."
5,"un bel film, ma triste","Long, but very good. Interesting characters and good plot twists.Kept me very involved."
5,uneven due to television miniseries format but worth watching,This movie was very good at conveying the weight of responsibility and how it affected the two brothers with different sensibiliites. I would buy this movie in its unabridged edition.
3,poor dvd formatting,"This comment concerns not the film but the formatting of the dvd, a matter of interest to anyone who might want to use scenes from the film in an Italian language or culture course. Its simplified subject matter, clear sentiments, and clear language make it a good choice for a classroom, but the scene selection options on this dvd seem arbitrary and there are too few of them. It's maddening to try to scan backward or forward to isolate specific moments and scenes."
5,i been feeling dry baby,"marvin was the master, ladies loved him worldwide, features one of gaye's best songs like let's get it on, and distant lover, i love the underrated ballad you sure love to ball that was marvin at his best, this is a clasic.all old school soul fans should check this out."
3,I've been feeling dry baby....,"Marvin Gaye's 1971 classic, What's Going On, was not just the soul singer's revolutionary venture into spiritual and social awareness, it was his most pleasantly sounding music to date. On 1973's Let's Get It On, Gaye attempts to employ the vocal overdubbing; breezy, jazzy backing; and general newfound confidence of his previous album in mastering the art of the sensuous love song. Some tracks, such as the incredibly passionate title track and the gorgeous ""Distant Lover"" succeed in channeling a rich, wavy groove. Others such as and the drippy ""Please Stay (If You Go Away)"" and the overdramatic ""If I Should Die Tonight"" feature dragging arrangement and repetitious wordplay (How many times does Gaye use the word, ""baby?"" Countless). The ration is about 50/50. Although the lush sound of What's Going On permeates through Let's Get It On, the album only occasionally features the raw material needed for a worthy follow-up."
5,Pleasures Of The Flesh,"After the success of What's Going On, Marvin Gaye moved away from social issues to issues of the flesh. Let's Get It On finds him singing about sex, not just about the physical pleasure one gets, but on a spiritual level. The title track is almost sermon like in it's delivery where Mr. Gaye dispenses with all pleasantries and asks his lover to get it on. He not only feels good, but he feels sanctified. The song has a silky sound that matches Mr. Gaye's smooth vocals. The rest of the album finds Mr. Gaye searching for a love that will help him find that balance between the real and spiritual ecstasy he so desperately craves."
5,There is none higher....,"""Smooth"" is the best word to describe this album. It's great from start to finish (remember when albums used to be like that). The title track is such a great song, that it's on here twice (Keep gettin' it on). Marvin's soulful voice never sounded better. If you want to get into his music, start here."
5,Wow you're on crack if you don't like this.,Ummm if you buy it you will know I borrowed it from a friend and he never got it back...so I bought him another.
1,Major Disappointment,"I could not get into this book because the writing style is so choppy that it totally distracts from what may actually be a good story (that and the characterization of the ""aliens"" is straight from the cartoon channel). When writing about a specific character, the author feels it necessary to restate the character's name about every other choppy sentence with the result that I feel as though I'm reading an elementary school ""tell me about yout favorite person"" writing exercise. It went into the trash can after a mind-numbing 30 minutes."
4,Author Review,"Battlecruiser: Prototype is the first of seven books in the Battlecruiser series that will be coming out in the next few years. The next book will soon be release is called Battlecruiser: Warrior's Code. Each story is separate, but when read together in order, will follow the history of the Battlecruiser Pegasus from its commission to its decommission. Join Commander Janice Anders Daria, Senior Deputy Commander Chris Jason and the rest of the crew on a Starship beyond your dreams in a war beyond your imagination."
4,Worthy Read,I purchase this book for class I'm taking. I must say that I was no not interested in the Synoptic Problem but this shed a lot of light on it. Kudos to the contributors.
5,well written and enjoyable for a textbook,"purchased for a class, but a welcome addition to my collection. I had not really appreciated the ""problem"" in the synoptic problem, and I still see no problem, but the controversy is more interesting now."
4,Great item.,"I purchased these to replace the strings on an older harp, not an EMS Rosa. They worked out just fine. If you're not handy, or really need detailed instructions, be aware that no instructions are included. The strings are organized into a variety of small zip-lock bags. They are of different gauges and not labeled, so you need to be observant about which one you grab as you restring. Some of the strings are not individuals, but rather you need to cut them yourself to create 2 or 3 strings as you go. Tonally, they sound good to me, but I am not an expert in that regard."
3,I agree with JerseyGirl..not for newborns!,"While I love the fabric and shape of this bouncer, it is certainly not for newborns. It sits up too much and you can't adjust it. My daughter (7 wks.) is just now able to sit in it but if she falls asleep her head falls to the side. I am hoping to get a little more use out of it in the future, but for now it is just taking up space."
1,Not for newborns!,"1)This seat is not for newborns or small babies! The seat incline is so vertical, that their heads flop forward! Plus, it is twice the cost the new Fisher Price one that I bought to replace it, which is so much better!2) I wouldn't buy anything with a timer on it, it will wake up the baby when it goes off!3) The only pro is that it does fold up and travel nicely in a bag. If you are buying for an older baby, this would be perfect."
2,Just not for us,"We got this bouncer just after the birth of our son (who is now 5 weeks old). He was never happy in it, probably because it just doesn't work well for a newborn. He always ended up in some contorted position. Just not for us."
4,Comfy and compact,"Living in an apartment we wanted to find items that would not take up ""too"" much space. I've used this chair right from the beginning since my daughter was 8 1/2 pounds when born. I really liked the fabric/color, and skirt covering. The favorite for my daughter though is the vibrations (low setting).This seat reclines more than the Ocean's Aquarium Cradle Swing we received...she seems more comfortable napping in this than the swing. There is a head rest that is adjustable which comes in quite handy. The music volume is perfect for me, although normally I only use the vibrations.Main drawback: only comes with little lamb for visual enjoyment. Also, headrest velcro somewhat difficult to attach."
2,Not the best choice in the bouncy seat market...,"I registered for this bouncy seat because I liked the color scheme, it matched the Windsor swing we had also picked out, and it folded for travel. Being a first time mom, I learned a little late what I should have been looking for in a bouncy seat, bc this one just doesn't cut it. Like everyone else has mentioned - the lack of toys makes this one piece of extra baby stuff that will never get used. For a bouncy seat, the thing doesn't bounce unless you push on it really hard - which is more than a baby can do. It is more of a seat with its upright position, and my daughter wants nothing to do with it. We ended up buying a cheap one at a well known dept store that she likes so much better.One thing that is good is that it folds up and has a storage case - bc that is where this seat is ending up...in storage."
3,Is This Bouncy?,"I bought this seat, hoping that it would calm my 2 month old son during his fussy late afternoon period. I was attracted to this particular bouncer mainly because of its portability. With my in-laws, parents, and taking him to work, it seemed to be the bouncer to choose. The biggest drawback that I have about this seat is that it doesn't bounce when he kicks. I literally have to put his seat in front of me while I'm working and bounce him with my feet. I was hoping for something to entertain him, but because I have to bounce him to sleep or calm him, it sort of defies the purpose. Also, there are no toys to keep him busy, except for that lamb which he's never even noticed.The only plus is the portability, as it gives our parents somewhere to sit him down when they get tired of holding him all day. I think I'll continue to keep this in my truck to take to different houses, but I'll probably invest in a more entertaining, more bouncier bouncer."
3,Wish I got something else..,"I totally agree with the others on this item. It is beautiful, but I am waiting until the baby is a little older to use it regularly. First, it's terrible for newborns. I wish I got one that laid him down flat instead of upright. HIs head always falls. He hates it most of the time, and there is nothing to entertain him so that sucks. I hope it's better when he gets older. I DO like the fact that the vibration turns off b/c i would never remember to turn it off (it's nice and quiet) and the batteries would run out. all in all, I would have gotten something else for my newborn. Maybe next baby!"
5,Great albums,"Just to expand on Spontaneous group members, their drummer Tony Brock subsequently went on to be a member of Strider and The Babies as well as appearing on several Rod Stewart albums and tours"
3,not so good!,"This is NOT the best NUFAN's l.p., but if you're a big No Use's fan, you should have it!"
5,Its one of those things you just HAVE to see for Your self.,"Rowena's oracles are out of control good.A good oracle will give you insight into what is going on in your life.A great oracle will give you a spiritual insight into your life that teaches you how hard times are helping you.Rowena's will do all of that, and tell you how to deal with it.I use other Oracles, Good ones, and I understand what is happening to my internal world and how it is good for me, but I still feel like crap. With Rowena there always seems to be something in the text or the image that I can use to change my mental state away from suffering.This oracle is completely different and new. its something that you just have to experience for your self. Its worth it"
4,Kunf Fu Wise-cracking madness,"I recently had the pleasure of watching this film.At first I was confused and irritated by the American character's accent not sure if it was put on and a little dodgy. But once I got past that and the British characters' constant swearing, rather than putting me off, the film pulled me in with it's clever -RESERVOIR DOGS with a side order of Chop Suey - narrative.It's simple, two amateur hoods bungle a robbery, get caught and have to protect a gangsters belongings till midnight, having to battle various Triad gangs along the way......Unlike many independent features, this one actually managed to pull off some ambitious fight sequences, had some interesting characters and kept the narrative together right till the end -even though it was set in one location.It was genuinely entertaining. Not perfect, but very capable and well worth checking out if you want something different!.Go on try it. You know you'll love it."
5,Lessons to Learn From a Soulful Brother,"I love the soulful voice of the late Marvin Gaye and this CD brought back so many long ago forgotten memories for me. Marvin Gaye was a man who was ahead of his time. He was aware of the dire conditions in the world and through his music he sought to help save the world by making folks standup and take notice...phrases such as radiation underground, war is not the answer, save the babies, etc., remind me so much of the messages that the late iconic Michael Jackson tried to impart to us about a dying world. When will we learn the lessons that these men were trying to teach us?"
4,Not Exactly Super Deluxe,"This Super Deluxe version includes a bonus CD of largely instrumental songs and outtakes recorded after the What's Going On sessions, a vinyl LP of the Detroit mixes, additional single mixes and demos added onto disc 1, a unique double gatefold LP-size jacket and a 12"" x 12"" booklet with two, large-print essays, liner notes and pictures.Missing are: the 1972 live concert and detroit mixes from the previous deluxe edition. Maybe they should have released a 3 CD + 2 LP (original & Detroit mix) super-duper deluxe boxed set that included all this stuff.-DW"
3,A Funny Light Read,"Beardsely recounts the events of her life in this memoir that became the popular movie ""Yours, Mine, and Ours"" starring Lucille Ball. The book describes the events after the death of Beardsley's first husband who left her with eight children. Upon moving to California, she falls in love with Frank Beardsley, the widowed father of ten children. The two marry and raise a household with twenty-two members in all, and all quite successfully. A funny light memoir for readers of all ages."
5,who gets the drumstick?,"if you liked the movie.... Yours Mine and Ours as much as I did, then you'll get a real kick from this book. it is the real true life account of Helen Beardsley and her and husband Franks wonderful family! although I makes you wonder what will happen next to this large blended familythe account of how they met, their courtship and Marriage is great! it is a must read book!"
3,I wanted to like it...,"I really wanted to like this, as Derrick May is one of modern music's true greats, and his tracks released under Rhythim is Rhythim are magnificent. But this album struck me as cold (and not in a good way) and meandering. It didn't grab the attention, which is something that Derrick May's music normally does - it slams you against a wall and says ""you're going to listen to me"". Maybe it was the other half of the partnership, but this is not even close to May's Detroit releases."
2,not such a crazy world,"I cherish my Crazy World of Arthur Brown cd, but this double album I could have lived without. When going from Crazy World to this, you are almost amazed that it is the same person. Brown's awesome screeching and wailing is toned down and put to very 1970's dance music, and where Brown once excalimed ""I am The God of Hellfire!"", he now Barry-Manilows his way through ""The Lord Will Find a Way"", ""Is There Nothing beyond God"" and ""The Lord is My Saviour"".If you like the Screaming Jay Hawkin's-meets-Iron Butterfly sound of the older Arthur Brown work, then stick with it and pass this up. Because although tracks on here like ""She's On My Mind"" and a mellower version of ""I Put a Spell On You"" are good, the CD, even as two albums, goes nowhere and does, indeed, end up sounding like hippy Disco music from a bad romance movie."
2,"Great ramekins, not so great lids",the ramekins on this are nice and stakable but the lids crack easy and strech out os they dont fit very tight. I had two of my lids crack in the first month.
3,grandma doll is adorable,My granddaughter loved this toy. I purchased it along with the dollhouse and the sister doll. She plays with it all the time.
4,Very detailed resource,"This dictionary provides an extensive tool for translating from German to English. My edition does seem to have a printing error in which part of the ""V"" and ""W"" sections in German are printed upside down. Considering the small price I paid, I don't mind flipping my dictionary around occassionally. Overall, I would recommend using this dictionary."
1,Disappointed,I was disappointed in the content/story. The book was intended for my granddaughter who was about to enter school and I thought it would tell a story about things children might experience in the classroom.
2,Not a very good teaching school book,My daughter loves Dora so I bought this book hoping it will teach her about school and ease her into the transition. The content actually has very little to do with school. Even my daughter who loves Dora doesn't care for it very much.
1,total disappointment,"i am a huge fan of all of celines dvds and cd's. this is the first one i have thought shoul be elimenated from her collection. it doesnot have 5 consecutive minutes about anything that has to do with her.all of the other items i have i love. i have seen her 3 times in las vegas and own numerous cd's.dvd's, books clothing jewelryand love them all. this is a total disgrace to have her associated with it. it is not even about her."
2,Passion of the Star,I was not impressed with the video. I like Celine Dion but not this video Since I rented the video for the week I have no intention to buy it
2,Not worth cost unless...,"An average, easily forgettable film that barely rates a 2, unless...you're watching it for Selleck's nude butt scene. That's the only reason this is $20, which is a joke IMO. But Magnum in a pink fufu bathrobe isn't interesting to me."
3,"you don't always win, but the delivery was still great.","The delivery was excellent. Fast, for being delivered to an overseas address. Packed well so there was no damage. Good price for the shipping.However, you don't always get what you hope for. The movie still played, the audio was fine, but it showed up in balck and white. I was hoping for better quality, but perhaps that was not possible without the Region 1/USA format."
5,Vastly underated,"This is a much overlooked crime thriller, with a delightful combination of charm and suspense. Selleck plays a succesful cat burglar in London just before the outbreak of WW11, coerced into helping a brutally determined British cop, brilliantly played by Bob Hoskins, into stealing a fortune of diamonds from the Nazis. The Nazis are suitably menacing, Hoskins roguishly deceitful, and the finale has a clever and unsuspected twist. All in all, one of the better crime thriller's I have seen."
5,One of my favorite Selleck movies---right up there with Three Men and a Baby,"Tom Selleck, Jane Seymour, an Bob Hoskins have great chemistry in this movie and the twists and turns keep you glued to the screen to see what will happen next. I hope the ""powers that be"" put this on DVD soon!!! Do you hear me??"
4,Entertaining But Somewhat Uneven,"LASSITER is a movie about a jewel thief in London during the years just before World War II. After an arrest he is pressured by British law enforcement and the FBI into attempting to steal a horde of gems from the German Embassy.The film is a fairly entertaining romp but there are problems with the script and some of the actors seem to be miscast. The movie does have many excellent sets and Tom Selleck gives a strong performance as Lassiter. The supporting cast includes Jane Seymour, Laura Hutton and Bob Hoskins. Hoskins is particularly good in the role of Inspector John Becker."
2,A number of problems...,"We purchased this stroller when we were expecting our second child. I should have read more review about this stroller before purchasing. We actually have it in a different pattern - but the same stroller.Pros: (1) the new basket drops down so that you can put things in it even in you have the infant carrier in the back seat.(2) I love having a cup holder for each seat + the parent cup holder.Cons: (1) When the infant carrier is in the stroller, it is almost impossible to get baby in or out.(2) Very hard to steer after a few months of use.(3) Seats are small(4) Recline - for the back seat - it's either reclined all the way, or sitting straight up. For the front seat - it doesn't recline at all(5) To fold this stroller you have to fold the front canopy down, drop the basket and put the back seat in it's upright position. (when you're in a hurry, or it's rainy - this is a pain to do!)Needless to say, I am looking for a good side-by-side stroller for my kids."
2,Duoglider,"I have a newborn and 16 month old. I am using my carseat on the backseat which is not handy at all. First you can not push the stroller and see the baby because the canopy hides her (with it opened or closed). Second, you really have to reach in to get her out. It is very difficult to pick her up and take her out. This is not a stroller to use with the infant seat. With my son in the front seat, he can see everything but I can hardly see the top of his head with the canopy on. The basket is very big but with the infant seat on and the regular seat needing to be reclined it is difficult to get to. I am not overly impressed with this stroller and am hoping that a different graco stroller works better for me."
4,Very good but not great.,"We got this double stroller because our girls were 14 mo. apart. Even though our oldest walks well now, we still use this when we are out for long walks or shopping so as to keep her closer to us.Pros: The car seat that came with the single child travel system works with this stroller too. Car seat can go in either the front or the back.Durable.Drives easily, rides smoothly.Cons: Difficult to collapse and open again. The wheels have to line up perfectly(!) with the frame so that the locking mechanism can catch. Also, the catch is so tight it's hard to unlock it in order to open the stroller again.Somewhat heavy to get in and out of the SUV.Bulky - Fits fine in our SUV, but in a car it has to be put in the trunk upside down so the trunk lid shuts. The problem with this is 1) stuff falls out of the basket; and 2) I don't like the parts my girls touch to be on the bottom of the dirty trunk.I'd get one again though. Once it's open it's a dream."
5,I love it!!!!,"After I had my 4th child in less than 5 years, and after using my first duoglider until the wheels literally fell off at Walt Disney World, I decided to purchase a side-by-side double Combi stroller. While I do like that stroller, it does not seem to work so well for very little children. I can't hook my carseat into it if need be. My 14 month old daughter likes to climb out of the front, allowing me to run her over even when strapped in. Today, I went and purchased this stroller. I love it, love it, love it. It is lighter than my old one. The basket is larger and the ride is incredibly smooth. My children were so excited to be back into the stroller. And it was much easier to navigate through the aisles of the Christmas bustle. Needless to say, I recommend this to anyone who has more than one child. I truly missed this product!!!!"
4,My Review,"Skipped a few in the series when I re-read this one, but I was headed out the door and grabbed something quick. Once again, Robert Asprin brings his unique blend of adventure and humor in this quality addition to the adventures of Skeeve the magician and his mentor Aahz. I enjoyed this book as much the second time as the first and it did not disappoint in quality after recently re-reading the first book in the series. The nice thing about this series is that, although it is sequential, it is not absolutely necessary to read them in order. Asprin does a nice job of re-introducing his characters and situtations so that if this happened to be the first of the series that you picked up, you wouldn't be totally in the dark. Great for a light, entertaining read."
1,One Day is the life span,"Disappointing!!! I had hoped to get more than one day of 'therapy' from these socks but found that after washing, carefully, the socks wouldn't even stay up! Let alone provide a bit of support. So not only lacking support but not even staying in place. Just warming my ankles until I could throw them away. Perhaps the company had these on their shelf too long?"
3,They work.,"They arrived, but no on time. But that is not a reflection of the provider but the postal system. Company was helpful with trying to find them when lost in the mail."
5,Decent compression socks for price,I have worn the socks and was pleased. They were what I expected. I checked around and felt comparable socks were more expensive.
3,too tight,The compression stockings were tighter than the mmHg indicated. But still acceptable to wear and look good under black dress slacks.
3,Meh...,"They're alright, but they're a lot smaller than I thought and they look and feel pretty cheap actually."
3,Cute Features but the people can't sit at the table!,"Ok, I really like the features of the Dora Dollhouse furniture in that it all does some kind of conversion! However - the people can't sit at the table b/c the sides of the table come down too far and they all fall off the chairs - if you can sit them on there at all. Only the jointed papi doll sits on the chair without falling off easily. My 2 year old gets very frustrated!!!!!"
3,disappointed,"Like most people, we bought the Dora House for our daughters for Christmas. We were bummed out to discover the furniture was no where to be found. Instead of paying hugely inflated prices on some websites, we waited...and waited for the furniture to be stocked in stores. FINALLY, the day came (in February) when we found the dining room and bedroom. What a BUMMER! Yes, the tabe does a cool conversion thing, but none of the people can sit at the table. It's almost like the furniture sets are too small for the people. The bunk bed set is a bummer too. The bed looks like a single twin bed. You push a button and the top bed pops up to uncover a second bed underneath. Pretty cool at first, then you realize you can barely fit a doll on the bottom bed. Also, if you put a doll on the top bunk, the weight of the doll pushes the ""spring loaded"" bed down. My daughters LOVE dollhouses and they are completely UNinterested in this set. I recommend Fisher Price Loving Family Doll House sets."
2,Difficult to use,"My kids want to like this set, it's nearly a full kitchen. The thing is, the movable parts are difficult to move. The oven door needs to be pried open and you need to jam your finger down to get the plate settings to move. ""Mommy, open it!"" is what I end up hearing every 30 seconds or so when my kids play with the set. Also, you can't take the lid off the pot. I realize this might exclude the product from children so young they may eat the lid, but even if it hinged open to reveal SOMETHING in it, it would have been nice. My kids try to take the lid off and I need to re-explain that it just doesn't open. Not a great toy. If your child loves Dora, I suggest getting the Dora figures with a different dollhouse set."
3,Intentional Shopper,"I purchased the Dora the Explorer Talking House Christmas 2005. It was a big hit with my than 3 year old daughter. I 've since added the nursery extension to the house. When Dora's Kitchen Island set came along, I included it on the Christmas 2006 shopping list. My daughter really enjoys the set. I like the fact that the piece fits in with the overall decor of the kitchen. In other words, it does not look out of place. My only issue is that the kitchen floor space is limited and tends to get a little over crowded."
3,Fine furniture,"This is very similar to the dining room set, I would only get one or the other and not both pieces. The pot barely fits in the stove and gets stuck in there which frustrates our 3 yr old daughter - she does enjoy playing with the set a lot though."
4,double pedal,its a good drums video skills for amature drummer. The lesson from the pros is really needed.
2,skip it,"this was the most confusing and annoying book! i hate that they think two people with a child involved would fall in love with each other in a little over a week without knowing a darn thing about each other. i also can't believe cat would go anywhere near caleb after the way he treated her. this might have been a good story line if the author hadn't rushed the story and made caleb quite a bit less cocky, arrogant, rude, and obnoxious."
4,A surprisingly good album!,"On the face of it, this is either an act of heroism or foolheartiness -- a tribute to a figure so iconic and universally lionized that following in her footsteps would seem to invite the sort derision that only the truest true believers can heap upon one another. But Vikki Clayton, who has filled in the ""Sandy Denny role"" at many a Fairport Convention concert, is quite up to the task. She opens this album with Denny's signature tune, ""Who Knows Where The Time Goes,"" in sort of a throwdown to any potential detractors, and as on several other songs, her rich, confident vocals and understated arrangements carry the day. There are a few iffy touches, mainly in the electric filters and effects added to the bass and guitar, but overall this is a pretty strong record. Clayton herself is quite lovely to listen to. Devoted Fairport fans, doubtless primed to be weigh in against this album, should really try to approach it with an open mind... it's pretty good."
1,Warning: be extremely carefull with SanDick drives,"I had this drive for six months. It worked fine until one day when U3 automatically insatalled EverNote software, which locked up the drive and it's now unusable. The worst part is that SanDisk said I need to talk to the software vendor and they can't help. The software vendor doesn't except calls, email only. You got the picture."
5,Sandisk Titanium 4.0GB,"Wonderful product. I like its speed and capacity. Not a fan of the software it brings for security. It gives you the option of uninstalling it after a few steps, which saved this product from losing a star. The memory stick glows a nice blue color as it works. Tested it on Windows XP and Vista without issues."
3,"Good little drive, not perfect","Pros:-4gb-U3 (I do make use of this to a great extent so to me it is a pro)-sturdier than the cruzer 2gb I owned before I KO'd it-very sleek design-nice blue ""active"" light; prefer over the orange light from the regular cruzer-cheap (I paid more for my 2gb when I bought it just over a year ago)Cons:-Feels more flimsy than 2gb titanium my brother owns-Did not come with the ""geek strap"" that was reinforced for the titaniums (had to swipe the regular strap from my dead 2gb cruzer)-Did not come with the belt clipI can live without the clip, but had I known that it did not come with titanium's strap I would have most likely looked elsewhere."
1,Disappointed,"The SanDisk 4 GB Cruzer Titanium I received is a disappointing flop. The product did not easily fit in any USB port, going in only by force or accident. The thumb drive catch broke and no longer holds the case back, allowing the case to slide forward and block the USB port. Additionally, the thing constantly caused computer hang-ups. Finally, after all the above frustrations, it managed to jam itself and will not accept or download data. I would have returned it, but I may be partly at fault by becoming impatient with trying to get it into a USB port. I will continue searching for a flash drive that is better machined to fit the ports it is designed to fit."
2,Not the product shown,"I really wanted this Flash Drive in the 4 GB, because I already have the 2 GB, so when I saw this was available, I ordered it immediatly. Instead of what is shown, I got this cheap plastic imitation, that was not the product shown. I was very upset for being tricked."
2,Watch out!!!! WARNING!!!,"THIS USB DRIVE ITS EXCELLENT. BUT IT DOES NOT ENTERS IN ALL THE USB DEVICES, AND IT ALMOST ASKS TO RESET MOST COMPUTERS YOU USE! OTHERS, IT RESTARTS ITS SELF.... BECAUSE OF THE U3 SYSTEM..."
1,Faulty product,"Unfortunately, I ordered this product and it crashed and took my data with it. Thinking it was a fluke, I exchanged it for anther one and it did it again. Buyer be careful."
1,USB Stick from Digital Media Source,"Where do I start!I thought everything was cool. I received the FD 4 days later and the FD is coming from NY. When I got it and opened the package it was the wrong product. I received the original Black SanDisk 4gb FD instead. So emailed them and when you do, you have to wait for the next day to get a reply. Again there in New York and I'm in California. They are about 3 hours ahead of California. So my question is why does it take them a day in a half to reply when you email them around 9 in the morning?Anyways long story short, I found this company not to be reliable."
4,"Good hardware, moderate software",Stick looks and works well. U3 software is a bit clumsy and also a pain to eject. If you don't eject properly than it gives an error next time you plug it in.I deleted the U3 software and this works great as a standard memory stick.
4,Solid.,Pros: Excellent value; U3 Smart Drive Technology; the cool blue light.Cons: The U3 technology seems to be incompatible with Linux-based operating systems.Overall: If you need a solid flash drive and find this one for less than $20 like I did...then buy it. You won't regret it.
4,simply the best,"The Sandisk Cruzer Titanium series are the only well-constructed thumb drives I've found, so my family owns several in 2, 4, 8 and 16 GB capacities. All the others I've owned break within a few months. I'm not fond of the U3 security add-on so I use the Sandisk utility to remove it - my only minor complaint about them. Good stuff!"
3,Received Different Product than Described,"The item I received is not exactly the same as the item described. Perhaps trivial, but the LED light is amber, not blue as advertised and I'm not certain if there are other differences, but the drive works fine and I was able to uninstall the U3 software (I didn't need it) easily."
4,"i got it, it works","my hobart 140 fits on it and it works, it takes a medium tank for the gas but i use flux core usually anyway. i do wish it was a bit taller."
3,Hobart 194776 Welder Cart,"The cart is ok for someone with small hobbies. The hardware to put the cart together is lacking. Most of the screws stripped out while putting it together. I re-drilled the holes and used 1/4 inch bolts instead of the cheap screws. This made the cart sturdier.It would be nice if the cart had a handle on the front of it to move it around while welding, but hey, it is for a welder, so I will weld on my own handle : )In the end you get what you pay for. The cart was cheap so I was not expecting much. If it gives me too much trouble then I will just make my own cart...haha"
3,Good enough.,"Works ok. Got mine free with welder purchase. It serves its purpose but it could be better. I agree with everyone else, you have the welder, build yourself a cart."
4,Best recipes,"This is not a field guide to identify plants, although it does have good illustrations. What is so good about it are the recipes! You will need other field guides, but get this for preparation of the plants once you have found them."
3,Close-Fitting And Long,"These Hanes Athletic Shirts come three to a pack and are a great value. They hug the body and are quite long. I use them to exercise in - for this they are perfect! The material is a soft, small-ribbed knit. They are fairly thin, but this makes them extremely cool and comfortable."
5,Different and Relaxing,"It's a sound that at first seems foreign and different. But, as you get used to it it is very relaxing. Great for meditation or a feeling of over all calm and healing."
4,Love this Vanity,We just got this vanity as a replacement for the Disney Princess vanity for our almost 4 year old daughter. She loves it!!! It's sized just perfect for tall girls!! She loves having a drawer and a storage area on the seat. She also loves the light. This is a very strong and sturdy toy that will last for years to come!!!! Thanks again Step 2 for such great toys!!!
5,Super nice,"What an awesome itemI I got it for my 3 year old. Her hight is 3'1 If fit her like a glove. My biggest concern was when she would stand up, her hands would put pressure on the edge of the toy and it would tip over and crush her seen as how it is 19 1/2 pounds. NOT the case though. It is very strong and so is the bench. It has been written on with pens & markers, they wash off very easy. Also, it is a super value & worth every penny! PS--SShh! Don't tell anyone........Ebay has 4 of them as we speak!!"
3,eh.,"this toy is okay, durable, and entertaning. but there is a whole cornicopia of cons. it comes with nothing special, needs an electric screwdriver to build and boy is that the anti picnic of the year! the finished produdct it fine but may need some fine tuning."
2,Possibly a Knockoff?!?,i sent this one back and got a full refund after looking at the item. the leather quality seems suspicious compared to my FENDI pieces purchased from the FENDI stored.
1,Journal?,"This book is not a good writing journal for the Daily Bible. I love my Daily Bible, however, the journal left a lot to be desired. It has the same four questions for each day of reading. There also is not a lot of room to write. I was disappointed. I will stick to the Daily Bible and a spiral notebook.Have a Great Time Reading the Daily Bible, just save yourself the money on the Journal and get a spiral notebook."
3,Footability for U10 and Up,"This video came recommended by one of our professional soccer coaches. As a recreational soccer coach, I needed some additional footwork moves for my team. She suggested this video, because this is what recreational coaches are not teaching. She said footwork is crucial if the player wants to play soccer in middle school,high school and beyond. Many of the kids today lack footwork ability. Being able to handle the ball effectively and under the players control will give an edge to the team. In reviewing this video, the moves are good and effecive but complicated at the beginning. This video shows 6 moves. In order to teach anyone of any age, the moves need to be broken down. The kids love learning new moves if you make it fun and the outcome is acheived. Don't expect them to learn the 6 moves in one season!"
1,Soccer-Footability-Technical Footwork System,"I am wanting to get a refund. I could not find a number to call anyone. The DVD is too simple. This is a case of false advertisement. The TV ad showed a demonstration with complex moves that my 13 year old wanted to learn. He has been playing elite soccer for several years now, and playing recreational since the age of 5. He is not a beginner, he plays on the #1 U13 team in the state of Georgia. I am saying this so that you understand that he would not have wanted it if he knew how basic it was. It was definately for the beginner, not at all what we were led to believe by the ad. I want a phone # to speak to someone about this as soon as possible and I want a refund because of misleading advertisement. My phone number is 770-287-8350 or 770-842-8350"
5,Grandson loved,"Our grandson has been facinated with my sewing machine so I bought this book. He made himself a loose pair of ""pirate"" pants his first try, after doing all the exercises in the book. I would highly recommend it."
2,MY FIRST SEWING MACHINE BOOK,THIS BOOK IS FOR LITTLE CHILDREN. NOT FOR OLDER CHILDREN. I WAS DISSAPPOINTED WHEN I RECEIVED THIS BOOK FOR MY YOUNG ADULT DAUGHTER. THIS BOOK WAS INTENDED FOR LITTLE GIRLS. THAT SURE BE MADE CLEARER.
4,Great kid sewing book,"I bought this for my daughter ( 9 years old) and she was able to sew a couple of pillows in no time. It is a very basic beginner book. The only complain it does not have too many choice to do, but it is fine for a beginners."
5,First Machine Sewing Book,This was a great simple sewing book. Almost everything you need was contained in the kit. Product description was spot on.
2,Disapointed,"Didn't care for this. Bought it as a gift for my daughter/future grandchild. Thought it would be something to read to a child later...but a little ""wordy""...don't think a kid would sit through it. This book is more for the parents...and really...once the kid arrives...who will ever have time to read it again? I picture it sitting on a shelf, collecting dust. I returned it."
2,MisLed :(,"this book was meant to be a gift . . .it was signed inside . . .i did not see that info mentioned AT ALL, or i would never have purchased . . .now i can't use it unless i tear out the cover page :("
5,A family tradition in the making!!,"This amazing book was given to me on the birth of my son, Dylan, and there couldn't have been a more perfect gift. The Gift of an Angel embodies the wonder of childbirth and the love surrounding a child, both here on earth and in heaven. Each and every time I read it, I am struck by the same feeling of warmth and love. Thank you Marianne Richmond for adding to our family traditions!"
4,Sweet.,"We got this for my step-daughter who just had a baby. I read it before I wrapped it up, it is very sweet. I think it is a book that she could read to her baby too, very soothing. She hasn't opened it yet, so I can't say what she thinks of it. Thanks Amazon1"
2,to many hulls for me,"Once I go through the tedium of removing the hulls, the cereal is good. I mix the puffed grains with rice yogurt. But I cannot tolerate eating it with the hulls included. I feel like I am eating my parakeets' leftovers. I probably will not purchase any more millet."
4,Fantastic Mitre Slot Table,"I purchased this for my husband. This is what he had to say: ""When I first ordered this product, I was worried it was some after-market gimmick. I can assure you it is for real. This item was easy to install and is a quality product. I now can use feather boards with my saw which are a necessity when making certain cuts. I highly recommend this product. Wish they made one for the right side so it could be used with the router attachment."""
5,MITER SLOT TABLE BT3000,"I found this product to be all that you would expect. It was easy to install and everything fit and lined up perfectly. I would say in a word ""GREAT"" ."
1,Poor Quality product,"I bought this piece to add the capability of using my Incra miter gauge for crosscuts. I have found that the slots are not milled consistently, which causes loose areas along with tight spots. Even though the Incra is adjustable for width, it can only be adjusted for the tight spots which allows a lot of slop in the loose areas.If you are not concerned with accuracy beyond about +/- 2 degrees, this is an ok product. But using it to make tight fitting glue joints or 90 Degree cuts is impossible.I have reverted to the sled that came with the saw."
5,Great product,This miter slot table fits the BT3000 perfectly. Now I am able to use more jigs and feather boards as intended.
4,Tight 70s Prog with a Zing,"The year was 1973...Miles Davis was near the end of his controversial 'electric' period; as were some of the other legends who followed. For Isotope, a prog-rock-jazz supergroup, their only 2 releases, the self titled and their final 'Illusion' from 1974, showcased what was REALLY happening in the rock-jazz music world. Herbie Hancock gave us Headhunters and proved that Jazz could be funky...ISOTOPE gaves us these gems and proved that a couple of white guys could jive, swing and groove with the best of em (with some added electronics, of course!)"
5,Great!,"Great horror flick, older movie but a good one. Woman comes back to try and possess her niece."
4,Nice little thriller,"Even though this movie has a couple of ""Aw Cmons!"", it maintains a nice pace and has a good atmosphere. Joanna Pacula is both talented and beautiful and it is worth the wait for her to appear. The price is a a little expensive, but I was able to rent it from Netflix. I would have bought this dvd if it was under $25."
3,The Quality of 'The Kiss',"I received the VHS video ""The Kiss' with a week. I like the content but the video sound while playing is not so good. The sound quality is poor with a staticky, buzzing sound that makes it hard to enjoy the video because the poor sound of the un-maintained video distracts the viewer/buyer from the movie. Too bad."
1,another bad movie,"This is another fine example of a cheesy 80's movie. It make you wonder why anyone would even bother to make a movie if they don't want to put the time and effort into making a half way decent film. What is truly sad is the story could have been good, but the people making the movie seemed to just want to hurry up and make a movie just for the sake of making one. And had no one of 1988 heard of eyebrow waxing? The mass of unsightly hair on almost every actor and actress was by FAR the scariest thing in this film."
3,Seemed a bit boring on tv,I've only seen the MONSTERVISION version on tv. I want the R version so I can see the scene where the blonde girl gets ripped up in the escolater.
1,worst drift wood ever,don't buy this it is not what the picture represents!!! looks more like a tree branch than driftwood and you can actually see saw marks like it is part of a pruned bush. Its a 20 inch long stick.
2,"Looks great, but turned water brown","I soaked this wood as instructed but months later it was still causing my aquarium water to turn brown. I ended up taking it out. It's very large and pretty for the price, but who wants brown aquarium water?"
4,Big piece,"This piece is big and heavy. But not very exciting. No branching, just plain looking. But it works for my setup. I realize it's by chance when you order it!"
1,Are you kidding me?,"This is large? I ordered 2 of these, and the largest of the 2 was approx. 16x9, and the other was even smaller. Either I was sent the wrong size, but gee, I can't tell as the size isn't stated on the packaging--or the product is misrepresented. Large is supposed to 20-26 inches!Immediately after opening the box, I applied for a refund, reboxed this junk, and UPS will pick it up tomorrow.If you need 20-26 inch pieces of wood, this ain't it."
3,not as gut-wrenching as it should have been,"Weak cast and direction don't quite pull it off. Strong theme, though. No doubt about it.I wanted it to have a greater impact on me emotionally than it ultimately did.What can you do? Not every director is a Claude Chabrol or Akira Kurosawa, and not every actor is a Chris Cooper or Seymour Hoffman or Marlon Brando. Neither is every actress a Carol Baker. Carol Baker was one amazing thespian in her time.Could be am being too harsh here. Not sure. That's the way I see it so far."
3,Nice book,I bought this book as a gift for my father who grew up in this part of West Virginia I thought he would be interested in it but he said it was very political and he wasn't very thrilled with it.
5,"A moving, authentic novel.","The West Virginia Mine Wars were long one of the untold chaptersof American History. Denise Giardina tells the tale unflinchinglyin Storming Heaven. It is an intense, moving novel about a timewhich still makes Appalchians wring their hands and should makeother Americans wonder that this went on in the ""land of the free.""Characters' voices are interwoven with the narrative in such away that there is no doubt that this is not just historical fictionbut the story of the human struggle."
2,disappointed,"I was so anxious to read this book, because I grew up in a coal camp in southern West Virginia. I was thoroughly disappointed. The characters are not well developed and neither are they believable. The entire book seems contrived, in spite of its historical theme."
1,kindle version,"The Kindle version of ""Storming Heaven"" has the text to speech feature disabled. I was very disappointed that after paying for the book on kindle I had to manually read it. Granted the flow of the book is changed by having it read to you but that was the reason I purchased the kindle version."
3,"Good book, but...","I thought the book was good. I finished it in two sittings. It's plot was good, but I could have done without all of the foul language and sex scenes. I thimk it would have been fine for the author to mention them without going it to so much detail. I did see a rationale behind one sex scene but not all of them. As for the language, I can see the importance of its existance. For these two reason, I cannot recommend this book to others in my family. But, if you can get past the language and the sex, I think the story is good."
2,It was ok,"I found this book to be very hard to read. It has taken me over a year to finish it. I would stop because it was hard to read and sometimes confusing. It was interesting to read about a different era but I found it to be boring sometimes. I actually considered giving the book away, but, I don't like not finishing a book once I start it. It takes perserverence to get get through this one."
1,PROTEST!!!!!,Sorry for my english.I'm very angryUp to now 08/01/2011 i've not received again my order. WhY?????Enrico Righelli
4,very good show... but,"my comment will be brief, as for this dvd the show is since impeccable but like I put in my I title he/she doesn't have good filming quality it is what he would lack to be some of the seen best recitals."
1,LAME and full of ordinary common sense you already know!,"This book is ridiculous!... it's full of ""innovative"" and helpful tips like...--if your kids don't like a food the first time--serve it again and again, they'll come around eventually.--let them help you prepare the food, then they'll be interested in it and want to eat it--smother veggies in cheese or ranch, all kids love both!ANY parent out there knows and has already tried this 100 times!!! As the mother of a finicky eater--(who, despite all attempts to not ""create or reinforce"" her behavior, still struggles with pickiness) I was actually looking for some HELPFUL information and useful tips a little beyond the ordinary, common sense even a nincompoop could pick out of their b*tt.Don't waste your time or money!!!"
4,Hilarious - a classic,"Campy, silly, and totally outreagous - a cult classic, if ever there was one. Beats the original Bram Stoker novel big-time. END"
3,"Not bad, but not good either","This film has most of the hallmarks of a Ken Russell film (bizarre halucinations, weird eroticism, etc.) It has been a while since I've seen this film and the fact that I've forgotten most everything about it doesn't speak to highly of it. Nonetheless there are some quite amusing scenes in this film that definitely make it worth watching (and some that many might find quite offensive). This is a good film for those who are looking for something different."
4,"Not bad of a film,just weird","It was not that bad of a film to see,it was different and original at least,the only down side to this is that,it was pretty much predictable at every turn or scene,but,it was still entertaining and worth having in your library."
2,Chinese knock-off copy,"This is not a good, legal transfer of Lair of the White Worm. It is a cheap, low-quality Chinese knock-off with a bad transfer and terribad subtitles. I would like to have been informed before buying it that it isn't an original transfer by the people who own the movie rights so I'm writing this review to warn other potential buyers. Caveat Emptor!"
3,Not a 5 star movie...,"This was a good movie, mildly entertaining with some unusual aspects and some nice looking actresses, etc. But this is not a 5 star movie by any means. It has several boring parts and is a little hoky."
2,"great movie, quality of recording poor","The movie is great, truly a cult classic. This version however, seems to be a low quality, region-free Chinese bootleg version."
4,BRAM STOKER'S ULTIMATE MASTERPIECE........,"This storyline is so intellegent, that I think BRAM STOKER should have been most known for this work of art, rather than DRACULA. Another story (which I'm still not quite sure if its based upon the same book, but just altered alittle) BURIAL OF THE RATS is almost just like this, but alot better. I suggest everyone to try this film out see if you like it better than DRACULA. Minus one star for campy acting."
3,A gem of a satire!,"Ken Russell does it again, flourishing as a genius of mondo-bizarro cinema! Here he engages us in a game of sorts, pulling us into the action as it writhes around on the screen before us. It draws us in, taking every ounce of Donohoe's performance into our jealously campy hearts. You can't help but completely fall in love with every perforamce presented here, but Amanda Donohoe is fabulous!!! Complete with monstrous white worms lurking in caves, vampire cults, blood and gore, sword play, Hugh Grant at his campy best (outshining even the likes of Rupert Everett) and a satirical director at the top of his form. Lair of the White Worm is a masterpiece, a hidden gem that must be given serious reconsideration!"
1,I thought with a Philips name it would be good,"I sadly bought this without reading any reviews, and sadly I had the same problem.When playing mp3 CD's the Philips AZ1303 would often stop at certain tracks before or during play, and revert back to track one, then stays idle.After making 3 different CD's burning at slower speeds to reduce error I realized it was the player not the CD's, so I decided to send it back to Amazon. New yeah right...I do have to say that the radio on the player is one of the best I have seen with little or no static even indoors.So if your looking for an expensive radio then this player is right up your alley, but if your looking for an actual CD Radio with MP3-CD Playback, then I would look somewhere else because Philips can't live up to it's name with this product.AVOID!"
1,Not very good.,"the radio reception was poor, and i had the same problems as the other reviewer. it would never finish a whole song on an MP3 disc without skipping and just stopping altogether. avoid at all costs."
4,"Enjoyable, inexpensive CD player","For the price, and for what you get, this is a fine machine. I purchased it on sale, and it works great playing my CDs and CD/RW discs.It has 10 presets for both AM and FM. The reception is very good.I haven't tried the MP3 capabilities, so I can't comment on that.But for a nice little machine for some background music in the home office, it works great. No problems, and the sound is good. There is much to like here. I'm glad I bought it.UPDATE: Here it is in 2011 and this thing is still going strong. It's a wonderful machine and I use it most every day. Great tone and a versatile device. I enjoy this one very much."
2,Is More Necessarily Better???,"In this case: No. Have you ever sat in front of the TV and surfed thru 300 cable stations only to find that there's nothing worth watching? That's the way I feel about this DVD.The early fires, (each runs only 10 - 35 minutes) burn way too hot with huge flames that make you want to bust out the fire extinguisher before the house comes down. - Not exactly relaxing.The later fires have cartoonish, clip-art-like mantles that look childish and really bad on the TV screen. And don't even get me started on those candles against the black screen with the white dots (a shot at an evening sky I assume).By the way, Is relaxing music supposed to include 'Horns'?I don't want mantles, a camera zooming in and out, goofy gimicks like matches striking, ......I just want ONE good fire, that is long running."
3,Ambient Fire 3rd Edition: Ultimate Video Fireplace DVD,Ordered this after seeing one playing in a garden center. There are a lot of choices of fire scenes and good music to play with it but just wasn't what I thought it would be. Nothing wrong with the product itself - just wasn't what I expected I guess.
5,Great game,"Wow I bought this years ago and I review it now lol. Well, this is one of my favorite games, I was telling my wife recently after playing it again after a few years, I noticed my last save was from 2007 just before we married, and I get to play it again all over on 2012, surprised because I forgot so much of it i enjoyed it again as before. Great RPG, you have to play it before you can't you won't regret it if you are into RPG's."
5,A new phase.,"This has to be one of the greatest series I've played, I love how the game is clean and came with almost everything, spare from the case, but that's no big deal. It came on time, and in a condition I try to keep my own games in. It was perfect I would recommend others to get their games from this person."
5,"Welcome to ""The World""","This game is the second in the .hack//G.U. series and continues the story of the main character, Haseo. You get to play Haseo as he continues to uncover the secrets of the fictional online game of ""The World"". Strange things are happening all over the server, and Haseo is well on his way to fixing it. The first problem that needs solved, however, is to be able to log out...This is the second series bearing the .hack name and it definatley adds to it. The game features beautiful graphics, many different areas to level up and play besides the main plot, a soundtrack to drool over and a fabulous plot which only gets better with the in-depth characters. Get to know Haseo, and you will never want to leave him."
4,Great Game,This is one of the most fun games I've ever played. It's got an interesting plot/story and is even better due to returning characters from the previous .hack series. I'd highly recommend this game to anyone...^^
5,Best game ever!,"Just finnished beating this volume. Totaly awsome, as good if not better than the first! The G.U. series is much better than the first four games. Don't get me wrong i loved those to but many hatted them. Don't let that turn you off these games they are fantastic. May die from anticipation watting for the last volume. Go out and buy these games today!"
4,Like the first :),"After all this time, it's a good game if you like grinding.A good game for passing time and a good story line."
5,"Stunning socialogical depiction, eye opening","The Beats Of The Heart series is about the most amzing musical cultural series I have ever seen. The only dissappointment is if one expects a concert DVD. This series goes into more depth in the cultural history and economic struggles of people than the musical elements. It is still filled with music however, and music that you otherwise may never really hear. This is not the produced, commercial version, this is the real people and their music. Chase The Devil specifically was one of the best in the series and pulls no punches in describing the harsh reality of a dissappearing traditional way of life in America. I only wish the whole series could be available at a discount in a package bundle on fewer discs."
4,Shower Hooks,"The hooks worked perfectly with the shower curtains that I purchased. They are very pretty and I like them, so no problems."
3,OK I guess,"They look nice enough, as you open and close the curtain the hooks go sideways and fall off the bar. this happens pulling or pushing the curtain, this is frustrating after a while."
2,"Pretty, but...","These curtain rings look very nice, and they're inexpensive. The problem is that they don't slide along the shower curtain rod very well at all. They come off of the rod and tangle with each other and the shower curtain."
3,Soap dispenser,Like the look and match to the shower curtain however it is a little bit too big (tall). Nonetheless I am keeping it.
2,Dripping soap,"After pumping soap out, some additional soap 'leaks' and 'drips' thru the space between the spout and the space where it attaches to the container. It looks very dirty unless you're constantly cleaning it :("
3,is not exactly for a shower curtain,i think the look is great and the size is perfect but all curtain have a protection from water in this case is a only a curtain to split areas in the bathroom not a real shower curtain in the shower space.
4,shower curtain rings,"Very nice and they matched my towels and shower curtain perfectly. Love them, Croscill spa leaf shower curtain leaf rings."
4,Perfect shower curtain,I received this shower curtain a few days ago and it was exactly what I needed to pull my bathroom decor together. It is made of sturdy fabric so I know it will last a long time. My only disappointment was the fact it had an offensive odor to the fabric and I had to launder it before I could hang it in my bathroom. I want to add that it does launder beautifully so I wouldn't hesitate to launder it if you purchase one.
1,worst curtain hook,I bought these beautiful curtain hooks to replace my old plastic rings. But I found these hooks really loose. They junp out and fall down very easily whey you pull the curtain... turned out worse than my 1 dollar plastic ones.
5,Castor Oil,Castor oil is an amazing health aid for so many aliments. The book was especially able to provide helpful advice regarding how to treat inflammation and arthritis which impact so much of our society.
2,The Oil that Heals,This books reads more like a story instead of medical information on how castor oil heals.
3,"Good product, but wrong one.","This product was good, but they sent me a white jersey and not the as described ""Navy"" jersey. My child opened up the package and saw that it was white and wanted it anyway even though he really originally wanted the Navy."
4,Pleased,I was very pleased with both the price and quality of the item. The shipping was also timely.
5,Another 5 star knockout by Jim Born,"I just finished Shock Wave and Escape Clause back to back.Jim Born has done it again. It is very seldom I can't put a book down, but this has been the case with all of Born's books thus far. The Bill Tasker saga is an excellent one.Once again, Born demonstrates his been there/done that superb knowledge of both the south Florida area, and the inner workings of federal, state and local law enforcement.Jim's books are also great getaway reading. They are easy to read, fun to read, full of twists and turns, and a great break from any other serious reading or work you may have to do. They are almost like a mental recharge.I only regret I did not know about his novels much earlier than this year."
3,Truth in packaging,"There is a missle, but it disappears from the plot almost immediately. The plot has many similarities to the earlier work and surprises with only the ineptitude of some of the police. No heavy lifting and little incentive to follow the series."
5,Master!,"I love Marvin Gaye, everything he touches is a masterpiece. His music is everlasting and at times relevant, case in point-Inner City Blues. He is a master because he is a genius at what he does bottom-line. R.I.P Marvin Gaye, your music will live forever."
3,This can be troubling,This isn't your typical marvin gaye disc. This is mostly instrumental and has too many versions of 1 song. Where there could have been more music for listening pleasure.
5,Sexy music,"Overall, this soundtrack is an underrated classic, but if you want music to have sex by, this should definitely be in your top 10. It's sexy, smoldering and sensuous. Turn the lights down, take Barry White out of the player and pop in Trouble Man. You've got it made..."
5,Marvin Gaye - Trouble Man,"One of my favorite tracks by Marvin Gaye..after listening to the expanded edition of this cd, I must say that i love every bit of it and it is relaxing to me because most of this album is instrumental, and has somewhat of a blues/jazz groove to it..even tho Marvin didnt get much recognition for this album, if he were alive today i would simply shake his hand and say what a job well done because Marvin was very talented and composed most of the music on this album and did not receive the recogition he should have received during the time of the release of the album..if you are a fam of Marvin, i would strongly recommend this album"
5,Buy this!,"To put it simply, buy this cd! String Cheese is the hottest band out today. The musical skills are all there, and they put on an incredible show(incident)as this set proves. Then, after you buy this one, get the rest of the On The Road series. I promise, you won't regret it."
2,"Incorrect Shirt, and Flimsy to Boot","I ordered this shirt as a birthday gift for a 24 fan. The company sent me the wrong shirt--one with a picture of Jack Bauer on it (holding a gun, so the recipient could not wear the shirt to school) rather than the one offered here, with the circle and the 24 insignia on the front. It was too late to go through the hassle of making an exchange, so I kept it, but couldn't help but notice also that the t-shirt is not a heavy, high-quality material. Pretty disappointing."
4,BEST CD!,"This was the best CD. I love the song ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" This is a good but cool CD! Take my advice and buy it you want to."
5,GREAT,I LOVE THIS DISC. MARVIN & TAMMI'S DUETS ARE WHAT LOVE SONGS SHOULD BE LIKE. TODAYS ARTISTS SHOULD REFER THESE SONGS WHEN THEY ARE WRITING. I AM ONLY 24 BUT I AM REALLY LOVING THESE SOUL CLASSICS
5,Some of the Best Motown Ever,"Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell in the space of two albums packed in some of Motown's greatest treasures, both in the well-known hits and the intriguing album tracks. For the third album, with Tammi critically ill, Valerie Simpson took her vocals in a kind gesture from Motown to insure Tammi got as many royalties as possible from record sales and to keep the duo's momentum going should she be able to return to recording. It's Valerie on ""Good Lovin' Ain't Easy To Come By"" and ""The Onion Song."" In the studio, Marvin and Tammi were known as diligent artists, hard workers who strived to make everything as inspired at possible. Their recordings without exception represent the creme of Motown achievements as they inspired each other, challenged each other and truly loved each other as only friends can. What a loss both have been, but the music lives on."
5,The 12 best from a great partnership,"Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell / Greatest Hits (Motown): This pairing was absolutely terrific. Solid Classics and precious gems have been gathered in this 12-song Motown Hits album. The only problem here is the lack of a decent booklet. Although this CD is a presentation of the original LP, there still should have been some effort put into creating at least a small booklet with a little history of this great team. However, even with that glaring error in packaging, substance overwhelms appearance in this CD and the music is all that ultimately counts here. This is an essential album."
5,Great Price for Organic,"These taste great, are good for you and organic to boot. I think the price is very fair for organic too. It's great to see the mass marketers listening to the public's cry for more organic food!"
3,Good Graphics but,"The graphics are good in the game, I had played the game for hours. After trying about 30 times to pass the mission on the Hood I decided to remove the game from my computer and cut up the CD. I will never play this game again. The part that stinks the most is every 2nd time I lost had to replay the whole stupid video over and over so I just gave it up."
4,Very Helpful,I am not much of a gamer and this book is very helpful in getting me past the frustrating obstacles I encountered right away.Well-organized and clear.
1,Disgusting!,"Former President Ford, freemason and member of many secret societies, writes as if it would be proved that Oswald would have been the assassin. Many investigations have shown, that Oswald was a patriot and a loyal CIA man, who was duped by the CIA and had to be the patsy. It is proved that Oswald couldn't have been able to fire so many shots in such a short time with that rifle and that the fatal shot came from grassy knoll instead from Mafia- and CIA-hitman James Files. It is also proved that Ford faked the actual shot position in Kennedy's back to support the magic bullet nonsense theory for the Warren Commission, which faked almost everything and consisted of Kennedy-haters only. Disgusting how politicians can lie to the American People!"
5,Wonderful Memories,I bought these videos to share with my horseless 4 H horse club. The kids love them! (and I am enjoying the memories).
3,LOVE MR ED,"The review by DICK YORK IS THE BETTER DICK ""ZACHARY SMITH"" ask the question""Does anyone know if season 2 will have all uncut episodes unlike Season 1?(which) are edited down to 22 minutes. . .""My question: Are they 22 minutes becuase of the deletion of commercials or is there deleted footage from the story line? What does syndicated versions mean? He also says you can buy a ""Bootleg"" set from NIK AT NITE what web site is that? I check the official Nick at Nite web site and no sets are fo sale there. And isn't a bootleg copy illlegal? Could be they are public domain shows - HELP"
3,UNCUT>?,Does anyone know if Season 2 will have all uncut episodes unlike Season 1?If the episodes are edited down to 22 minutes....there is no point tobuying this. YOu can buy a bootleg set from NIK AT NITE for 1/4ththe price if they are still using syndicated cut prints as theydid for 1/3rd of Season 1. ( iwas also forced to give thisa rating in order to post my question).
1,Not in COLOR !!,"This product is not in color, even though the Amazon product specifications say it is ""color"".I bought this set, and all the episodes are in Black and White, quite a disappointment for my children, who will not watch anything in B&W;."
5,It is the explanations in this book that are WOW!,"There are so many things covered but I will use one example:the Unsharp Mask filter ... in two pages you understand what itdoes, when to use it vis a vis the other filters in the sharpenfamily, how to apply it, several specialized uses for it toimprove overall image sharpness, and when in your sequence ofthings you are doing to a photo to apply this filter to get thebest results. The entire book is loaded with great info and Icome back to it again and again. The CD materials are reallyhandy too..."
2,Not recommended for Photoshop beginners,"I purchased this book several months ago, having no experience in Photoshop. From the first I found the book overwhelming and confusing. Maybe it's my style of learning, as I was expecting a more linear style. Something like, ""Okay, here's what you need to know to get started"" and ""Now that you know this, here's how you do that.""But this book, to me, is needlessly complicated. While it's excellent for detailed descriptions, I wouldn't recommend it for beginners. I found myself reading and re-reading descriptions and information, breaking out the highligher pen, trying to glean the basics from pages and pages of details that were, for a beginner like me, irrelevant. I say irrelevant because I was given information on things I hadn't learned yet.I wound up purchasing other resources to learn Photoshop. Now that I have a basic understanding of the software, this book is a little more useful, though still too complicated for my taste."
3,Not for real art photographers,I bought this book based on the reviews I read and I have to admit its not what I expected. Isn't there a book out there for non-commercial photographers? Does every photoshop user have clients and need to make a buck? Where is the voice of the true art photographers. This book is full of glitz and tricks for making photos that look like they belong in magazine ads and as posters on a teen-ager's wall. If that's the type of art you are looking for then this is the book for you.
1,Unsuitable for a beginner,"This might be a good book if you are already a Photoshop expert, but I bought it hoping to learn how to use Photoshop. I was extremely disappointed. The instructions for accomplishing tasks are bareboned at best and filled with terminology that is never explained. Basically it is just a book where the work of photoshop artists is displayed and explained in an incomprehensible way. So as not to have totally wasted my money, I plan on going back to the book after I actually find another method of learning the program. I might be able to glean some useful information out of the book at that point."
2,NOT for the beginner,Very nice book but not for the beginners. The book assumes that you know where all the tools are and how to perform certain tasks. For a beginner like me I need a book that shows step by step with pictures how to perform the tasks... Other than that a good book for the experts...
1,Scrappy,As a beginner at Photoshop this is not the book to get. Sure there is tons of imformation but it the biggest unexplained jumbled mess that I have come across in a reference book. I have had the book for six months now and end up every time confused and frustrated by unclear instructions. Definately not for beginners
2,Not for the beginners,"Brilliant book for people that want to read every line of text and then ""try"" to recreate the sample given in the book. However I would not recommend this book for people that like to be guided step by step. I myself would have liked to be guided step by step with visual pictures..."
5,Photoshop Tips and Tricks Revealed!,"Hiya,I bought this book a few days ago, and i LOVE it! The Photoshop 6 WOW! Book can serve as a reference and reading material. Along the left side of each page are cliff/cole 's notes that containa breif summery of the page with pictures! There are many tutorials, filter/preset informating and lots of gallerys for inspiration. I am totally BLOWEN away with this book. In just a few days i know more than weeks searching on the internet for ps tutorials!Thanks Linnea Dayton and Jack Davis for creating a truly wonderful book!HIGHLY RECOMENDED FOR PHOTOSHOP USERS!!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"Just goes to show that just because these bozos can use Photoshop it doesn't mean they can explain what they are doing. One of the worst, most over rated CONFUSING Photoshops books EVER!!! The number of glowing reviews about this makes one consider how objective these people are."
1,Great Book...but.....,"Somehow, I have trouble recommending a book...regardless how well written...when the accompanying CD is bad. Put it in my cdrom and everything was there and would function, but the cd decided it owned my computer. I could not get the cd to eject by any means other than manually forcing the door open, and even then...with the cd removed...the computer insisted that the cd was there and would not allow any other action. Made three attempts in three PCs with the same result each time. NOT worth my time or money."
2,"Basic for the experienced, too vague for beginners","The authors may have used Photoshop to produce some wow effects, the beginner will find it hard to follow and the experienced user irritated by the elementary bits such as the touching up of photographs. Take out the photographs and one gets a very ordinary textbook. Go get a copy of Peachpit Press Visual Quickstart Guide instead if you want to learn to drive this powerful software."
1,Ms. Hewlett misses the mark big time,"If we take Ms. Hewlett's observations to the natural conclusion in a perfect world American women would all be white trash and get knocked up at 19 regardless of their ability to succesfully provide for themselves and their children.I have no delusions about my biological clock yes I went to grad school and did the career thing, but the real problem is finding decent,intelligent, emotionally available, finacially stable, non-commitmentphobic men. Why isnt that that the cover story of Time magazine?!As if we dont have enough stress post 9/11 world, do single women really need to have this [nonsense] thrust in their faces?"
1,Grinding an axe or profitting from the aging boom?,"This book is such an embarrassing outpouring of disorganized emotion about an admittedly sensitive topic. Regarding fertility technologies, we use technology to extend life, go to the moon, etc., so why not use it to extend childbearing years, expecially when Ms. Hewlett's alternative is marrying some [one] at an early age. Speaking of humiliation. ...Why is there no mention in this book of freezing embryos when one does have young eggs or efforts (as yet unsuccessful) to freeze eggs? Perhaps a little too radical for this book's retro recommendations for women.Obviously this book was a ploy to profit from the aging boom."
1,Very depressing,"As a woman who has been dealing with infertility for 6 years, I thought this would be a help to put my mind to rest as we approach our final attempt at IVF and our outlook toward work and family. Instead, I found myself wondering if there was any hope at pursuing this venture yet another time. If you are doing research on the subject this book is for you - filled with lots of statistics - most negative to a woman over 40 trying to conceive. I cried through most of it and ended up throwing it in the trash. Yes, the over 40 generation knows the percentages, but lets focus on the positives of those that work!"
1,Yet another guilt-trip for women,"Has it ever occurred to people like Ms. Hewlett that ""having it all"" does not necessarily include motherhood? I resent the implication of her book's title that women who choose to forego child-rearing somehow lack ""a life.""The so-called 'biological clock' is nothing more than a politicaland social construct designed to manipulate successful, intelligent, well-educated women into having babies. ...What books like this fail to take into account is the significant number of women for whom motherhood holds no interest. Instead of joining in the collective Baby Boomer hand-wringing over this ""issue,"" childfree women are out there enjoying life, and not experiencing the empty hole that the media keep insisting they should have.Women over age 35 who choose to remain childless are growing innumbers. We have disposable income, and we vote. It's time thisdemographic stops being overlooked. We're not buying thebrainwashing."
2,Influential but flawed,"This book has many biases and flaws. Other reviewers have already gone into detail on these points, so I won't belabor them. I gave this book 2 stars because it created huge waves when released: was the subject of many magazine articles and television shows in the following months. So, if you are like me and enjoy keeping on top of books that have helped shape the news, note that this was one of the most most talked-about books of 2002. That being said, my other point is this: there is a business in making people scared and prophesizing doom and gloom. Does a woman's fertility decline as she ages? Sure. But it varies wildly from person to person. Do you really want to put your money towards trying to scare the wits out of high acheiving North American women, making them feel even more pressured than they already do? I, for one, would rather not."
1,not another book to make me feel guilty,"I picked up this book on the reccomendation of a friend and was appalled at what it espouses. I am a hard working freelance writer who owns a business. I am independent, unattached and would have liked children. I made the determination that I would only have a child if I was married. I was raised by a widowed mother and it is not an experience I would inflict on any child. I truly tried to find someone to share my life with and raise a family. It didn't happen. So now, I not only have to deal with the ever present guilt inflicted upon me by my mother for not giving her grandchildren, and the prospect that I will die alone and unloved, I must also feel guilty for not getting knocked up in high school. Somehow, this seems a heartless and cruel attitude and I resent the implications that my life is worthless because I do not have children. I returned the book."
1,Hewlitt's assumptions and biases undermine and derail study,"There's a reason that women who achieve a lot don't always have children; it's called opportunity costs. And, the road not taken is often avoided by design. Hewlitt needs to give men and women more credit - not every woman is infantile and not every man is insecure. Sometimes the choices we make just seem inadvertent to people who cannot see beyond their own agenda.Overall, Hewlitt's assumptions and clear biases undermined and finally derailed any legitimacy her research might have had. Further, her analysis was in the end sophomoric and disorganized."
1,why oh WHY!!!!??,"OK, firstlynone of these kids can sing, they ALL sound the same, on EVERY song. The only reason its not a complete sounding disaster is down to the mixing.secondly, I paid $14 for the latest NOW THATS WHAT I CALL MUSIC album, yet a bunch of kids singing karaoke costs the same...what the hell??this is PURELY and SIMPLY the biggest pile of garbage I have ever known. The songs are on the same tone, volume, level , everything!talk about a crappy way to make a buck!please dont make any more!!!There are real musiciansd out there trying to get record deals, you know, with real talent!!just leave this sort of stuff in the freeby bin.In the UK, where I used to live, this sort of album sells for about a dollar a time!"
1,Doesn't even deserve one star,I guess there's something for everyone as some people actually gave this train wreck five stars. But this is garbage plain and simple. The kids that I know under ten years old don't even like this crap and it makes my one year old god child cry. This is rife with bubble gum voices the equivalent of nails on a chalkboard and the fact the keep spitting out series is further insult to injury
1,Whyyyyy?!?! Whyyyy?,"Nooooooooo.I have come to hate this....well, I don't know what to call it, you see. It's not a CD-if it was, it would be music. And it WAS good music till they shot it and threw the body into Ourmuziksux (Pronounced Our-MUSIC-Sucks, children!) River.First off, they think they're all cool adding country music to the list. I listen to country and am royally angry that they thought it was OK to murder 'Girl Next Door' and 'Who Says You Can't go Home' (or whatever it's called. THAT WAS ME AND MY FRIEND'S JAM! Why? Why?)So, to the producers of KB....please. Stop. I liked Pump it, and L.O.V.E, and Bad Day and all of those songs and ya killed it. STOP THE MADNESS!"
1,THIS CD SUCKS,I am a kid so take it from me. If you want your kid to listen to clean music thats actually good buy them the Now cd's. Thats what I listened to when I was little and I'm 11. The people on this cd sound like dying cats. Listen to the originals PLEASE!!! These cd's came out when I was little and I hated them then and I still do. Warning: this music sucks! dont listen to it unless your gay or stupid or a extremly young kid (like ages 1-4)
2,Company would not replace defective CD,"I purchased a Kidz Bop CD at a store that was closing and therefore cannot return it to the store. Four tracks skipped right out of the package. Of course Amazon will replace a CD for you, but mail order returns are really quite annoying, and the Kidz Bop store would not replace mine. Buyer beware."
1,i died LISTENING TO THIS.,"These kids have NO TALENT whatsoever. This is the worst CD I have ever had the displeasure to listen to. I have no idea how they have ""successfully"" made 10 albums. I'd rather listen to some idiot making stupid and annoying noises for 3 hours than to ever hear 2 seconds of this trash again. They ruined some of my favorite songs. Where in the world did they find these 'kidz'? I think they look for swomeone they don't have to pay. THEY SUCK!"
1,"I'm 12 years old, and I like good music like Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin!","This is so rubbish most kids don't even like these songs, and I bet those [...] kids make it even worse.Ive not even bought this cd I just like to point out that 60's and 70's rock rule, this is.....well what can I say.I'm appauled."
5,Great bargain,"I actually listen to it a lot. I bought it for my little 5 year old cousin and made a copy. Now I own a few from the series. Some of the versions I like more than the real songs--something about the old-school synths, all wacky, especially with the R&B numbers. I guess it's a hipster's affinity for irony that ultimately leads him to love this series so unironically."
3,Fun music but not so good lyrics,I bought this for my daughter. She likes the music but I find the lyrics not appropriate for young girls. Maybe I am just too old-fashioned. I don't recommend it to kids younger than 16.
1,"Move over, Walk of Shame! Here Comes Kidz Bop!","Time to face the facts. As much as you don't want to hear this, [or maybe, like me, you do] Kidz Bop isn't worth the $16.00 that they are selling it for. I mean, why are they introducing Top 40 songs to 3 year olds? it just doesn't make sense. In earlier Kidz Bops, I think there was like Britney Spears on it. Um, these kids are like 5 when they are listening to this.....PLUS the Kidz can't even sing! In fact, it's kind of creepy sometimes! They have REALLY high voices, and the adult singers don't even attempt to sound like the real singers! I feel bad for the artists whos songs are on this pathetic excuse for music! And they came out with Kidz Bop 11, ruining more great songs! This is a BAD CD.....don't be fooled by how ""cute"" the commercial may look! These people make Barney and Friends and The Wiggles look good! So DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"A kid pleaser, an adult irritation","This CD has it's perks. First, if I hand this CD to my 4 year old she will belt out every word of every song for a good hour. This is a good thing if I'm trying to clean house or cook dinner. This also means that while she is belting out these hits she's also dancing...also known as exercise. On the downside, to a 31 year old adult this CD is just plain painfull to listen to. It's obviously not the original artists and the ""Kidz"" sound computer generated.This is especially true to the rendetion of Bon Jovi ""Can't go home"" it sounds as if the ""kidz"" are saying they highjacked a rainbow and fell into a pothole. How interesting. Anyway, the bottom line is if my daughter loves it than I can certainly live with it, with my MP3 player plugged into my ears."
1,WTF??????????////,"Stop releasing this!!!!! I don't give a rats as s about how much money your getting. Razor and Tie is just a sh itt y label that releases crappy kids albums that no one except idiot soccer moms and pre pubescent children who don't know s hit about music. If you want to get your kids into good music, jsut get the The Beatles, it's the only band that's good that anybody could listen to.I hate Kidz Bop almost as much as I hate Disney music (bleh)."
5,Kids Music That Doesn't Suck,"I just want to say that I love the KB10 Cd. Whenever I babysit my little cousins, they always want to put on the cd, and it is actually music that I can sing along with and enjoy. I really can't stand some of the stupid kids music that just talks about circles and colors. It is nice to put on some music that we can all enjoy and sing along to. Thank you Kidz Bop for making my life saner."
4,The Unspoken Word,"This was an enjoyable book except for the many, many typos. One could hardly read a dozen pages without encountering one or more words missing from sentences, or letters missing from words. I would have enjoyed this book much better had someone done a better job of proof reading."
4,Let's put on a show!,"You know the old movies where the kids say ""Let's put on a show!""?? This magic kit has captured the neighborhood kids' imagination. Many hours have been spent in practicing and preparing for their magic shows. It is not exceedingly durable, but the thrill of figuring it out and being careful with some of the parts seems to have won out."
4,Neat idea!,This is a great thing for a child to experiment with. The directions are a bit complicated though. Wish there were better descriptions and better photos.
4,Fun for homemade magic tricks,"We've bought this set for our 8-years old son, and he definitely likes it. In a certain mood he can spend a lot of time, trying to play those simple magic tricks (some of them are very simple but very impressive), training himself in front of the mirror and then showing them to us. He's not the greatest magician in the world, but he's doing good. Sometimes he even tries to make a trick by himself. So I suppose the set could become a good start for to-be-a-magician or at least to push kid's interest, fantasy and imagination."
1,A pale copy of Tony Hillerman,"I have read every Tony Hillerman novel and was looking for something similar. This is not it, even though its set in the same area. This is not the first book in the series, but it is the only one I have read. Almost all the dialog is unbelievable. The people in here say things MUCH too openly (when is the last time your lower status coworker who doesn't like you came right out and told you so?). The plot was not believable and was overly complex. I used to live in New Mexico and have been in the four corners area where these novels take place. You really don't get a very good feel for what the area is like from this book. For ex, I remember being in a McDonalds in Gallup, NM with very traditionally dressed Navajo women and Navajo men in jeans and cowboy boots. I think many people would find the area almost as different as a foreign country.Won't be reading more of these - I will go back and reread some Tony Hillerman."
2,London Blue Topaz Earrings,"I was not at all happy with this purchase. The topaz is very pretty but the s.s. looks very cheap, does not look like .925, it looks as if you could have bought this at a discount store"
5,Best Little Book on Money You'll Ever Read!,"I own several copies of this book. I have also written a study guide for it, with key included, that contains multiple-choice and short answer questions. The positive reviews of this book are all right on the mark. I can hardly add to them. As for the negative reviews, note that Brazilian doesn't support his contention at all and the Australian resorts to an appeal to authority, one of the weakest of all types of argument. This book is a classic gem!"
4,Liberty Classic,"In the course of five decades the world has gone through many disasters and catastrophes. The policies that brought about these unfortunate events have also affected the nation's currency systems. Sound money gave way to progressive depreciating fiat money. All countries in the world vexed by inflation and treatened by the gloomy prospects of a complete breakdown of their currencies. The great inflations of our age are not act of God. They are man-made or government-made; ascribed to governments the magic of power creating wealth out of nothing and of making people happy by raising the ""national income"".Sound economics had been prognosticated by inflationist and expansionist who refused to take correct daignosis of the monetary reconstruction..."
4,Factual account of a history of money.,"I am relatively new to the written word of libertarianism, but have been there in theory and practice for quite some time. That set aside, this short, yet informative, book will give ANY reader looking for an account of the history of money all they would need and then some.I was very pleased with the content of this book. It first explains how money came to be, and then, expands on how it has progressed to it's frail existence today. However, the primary focus is how government intentionally inflates money through various interventions. It also explains how things could be drastically different with money back on the gold standard and untouched by regulations.I'd recommend this book to anyone looking to expand their knowledge on the history and workings of the monetary system."
3,Spelling/Grammar mistakes galore,"The book is great, the problem is this publishing company filled the book with spelling and grammar mistakes. It's hard to make sense of some of the sentences. I'd recommend finding a different version."
1,Exactly what I was waiting,"this book has one big problem: it has more ideology than economic theory, more beliefs than science"
2,The Lucy Show,"Fellow Fans, Today I've gotten this Dvd in the mail. When I open it and read the LIST of shows. I was sooooo unhappy. It's the same shows that been on repeated 100's of times onto many Dvd's. I wish that somebody would bring the show The Lucy Show complete shows in order. So we (fans) can watch a GREAT Show. Ken a true fan."
1,Caveat Emptor!,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!I PURCHASED IT AND I DEEPLY REGRET DOING SO. THE THING WILL NOT PLAY IN MY PC.
5,Good but not teriffic (like some of her other books),"Philo is a boy in the first century (Jesus's time). His sister is posessed by a demon. Because he can't stand to be at home anymore, he runs away and he learns about Jesus and he is never the same again. This book has a great ending. (I don't want to spoil the surprise.)"
5,"Very good book, specially to read to your childs",Patricia writes here an interesting story that happens in Jesus times. The book is very interesting and at the same time it brings a clear and clean message about the Lord's teachings. I would recommend this to you if you want to read a book for yourself or for your kids.
5,East meets West,"Annie Chun's Pad Thai Noodles are versatile. They cook quickly and well. When I've made my own pad thai,they've proved useful. They have a good neutral flavor,and soak in sauces easily. They're also durable,and hold up good in stir frying. Annie Chun's Pad Thai Noodles are a must for Asian cooking! ESPECIALLY stir fries!"
3,Pretty good gluten-free substitute for linguini too,"I've used these noodles to make pad thai, but also as a gluten-free substitute for linguini, and have been happy with the result. The price is good too.However, I preferAnnie Chun's Brown Rice Noodle, Pad Thai, 8-Ounce (Pack of 6), also gluten-free, with four times the fiber. They're just as quick and easy to prepare - and are also not that expensive purchased online, though I don't always buy them through Amazon."
5,great product,"great buy on these rice noodles. it ends up being a little more than $2.00 per box, which is nowhere the cost of your local supermarket. there are easy ways to cook these noddles. you can simply boil a large pot of water and place them in the pot SUBMERGED and just let them sit until they achieve the level of doneness (chewy, but al dente). you do not have to put a lid on the pot and turn pot off. you can also prepare them in the microwave a large glass bowl with enough heated water to SUBMERGE the noodles. i tend to use the microwave method and let the noodles sit SUBMERGED for about 6 minutes, check by tasting and adding additional minutes as needed. the subscribe and save with the free delivery is the way to go. can you imagine the cost of shipping and this vendor ships quickly."
5,I really enjoyed it.,"I had a couple minutes in this film, so I might be a little biased, but I had no clue that the film would turn out to be this well done. Everyone should give it a shot. You'll probably enjoy it."
4,MBM continues to evolve.,"With the release of Satyricon MBM i.e. Jack Dangers continues to evolve to a more techo sound from his industrial roots. Not that its a bad thing. When I first bought this CD back in '92 I was put off by the sound. I was expecting a more industrial sound like 99%. I have listened to it since then and have come to appreciate it. Even though it was made ten years ago, I think it holds up well and still sounds good. Its like he had to make a ""mainstream"" techno CD before he started to experiment. If you're looking for a sound like ""Subliminal Sandwich"" you might be disappointed that it sounds like other techno music. Personally I don't think you will be."
2,the MBM nadir,"an unfortunate byproduct of touring with consolidated, jack got political on this one. too bad. the humor became smug, the grooves fascistly uniform, and musical depth and creativity secondary to ""the message."" a brainless effort that could be exchanged for any number of turn-of-the-decade poofy electro-marxist outfits. and the saddest thing is that his bumber-sticker issues weren't worth the sacrifice. he says nothing new and doesn't even come up with a new way to present the old.i totally agree with the reviewer who encouraged folks new to mbm to search jack's brilliant earlier or later years (99% & subliminal sandwich). but lordy, don't stop here.in particular, check out storm the studio, a deleriously fun but oft-forgotten early release."
2,Not as good as I was hoping,"I bought this because it was the closest formula to some of the older, better weight loss supplements. Unfortunately, this wasn't a good replacement. It could be that my body doesn't react as well to this formula as it used to, but there are other issues as well. When I opened the bottle, at least 20% of the capsules had burst during shipping. Since it's an oil/liquid supplement, it coated all the other capsules and made them slippery and difficult to take. I got some energy from JetFuel, but not enough to justify the price. I'd skip this one and try something like VPX Redline Ultimate or Meltdown. With any energy supplement, it's important to take a week every month for optimal results, otherwise your body can adjust and they won't be as effective."
4,"Burn fat fast, well doing cardio",This has been a great product for me and a few freinds that have been taking it. We find that if you take it in the morning and do cardio you will burn off all that water weight!
1,did not recive it,i did pay fot this and 2 more thing that i did not recive.. but my card was charged :(( i have tryed to talk and email amazon.. no luck:(( so i am out my $$$$
2,"great item, shipping rip-off","I love my cone vac and wanted to replace the filter. I found a filter for a great price $4.00 on amazon and found out they charged me over 6.00 to ship the item standard shipping! This is a complete rip-off, the item literally weighs a few ounces and comes in a tiny box. Next time I'll buy it in the store."
5,Satisfied,This works on my Dirt Devil Kurv. Be careful when replacing your filter for the first time. DO NOT THROW OUT THE RUBBER RING THAT POSITIONS THE FILTER IN THE VACUUM! I almost did but quickly realized my error.
4,does what it is supposed to do,"Product works fine. Over time the cup and rubber ring separate, which is why I had to buy replacement filter."
1,Doesn't fit the Kurv,"Got the item because my Kurv filter needed to be replaced only to find out they are completely different filters, even though it says on the listing that it fits the Kurv."
4,Coaching Essentials for Managers and Executives,"This video includes the definition and philosophy of coaching, the key elements for successful coaching as well as a guideline for a successful coaching session to include an excellent goal setting tool(which I have used and is loved by my coachees), a review of different personality styles and many other tips and techniques-a very helpful tool for managers, executives and coaches."
5,best overview of america's poets,"my own poem, ""Ode to Jasmine Jade--That I Might Find Her"" is one of my personal favorites. What surrogate or adoptive mother cannot help but relate to the verbage?"
2,NOT TOUGH ENOUGH,"Ted D. plays the lead in this movie instead of John Cena and that was a mistake. Ted didn't come off as being tough enough. You know when you watch an action movie and you get that sense that the hero in the movie is going to kick butt and mess up the bad guys. I never really got that feeling from Ted; he came off as a guy with an adorable smile. He just didn't have that dangerous vibe that a one-man hero need's. Even John Cena came off as being more tougher than him. Ted was playing a experinced Marine in this movie, but he came off as being a guy who just joined the marines rather than an experienced Marine. He just wasn't believable as The Marine 2 and WWE could have casted this movie better. It's an okay movie, but there are no highs. It's just below average the whole movie."
5,marine2,"i enjoyed the movie,but i have both dvds now they are good lot of action too bad cenna did not make marine2 it would have been better."
3,The Marine 2,"i received this dvd with REMARKABLE SPEED but NOT AS REQUESTED, i requested FULL SCREEN but was sent wide screen instead, please LIST version of dvd selling (full or wide screen) so buyer gets dvd of their choice, & AVOID version issues. we as buyers want BOTH movie(s) & version(s) of our choice, while some prefer wide screen, i want FULL SCREEN ONLY!!! no exceptions. your rating is 3 for NOT PROVIDING VERSION requested, rating will continue to drop until version is received."
3,Marine 2,"Military type movie. Better then average, but missing some real punch. All muscle little brains. Could have been better. Better then the first one."
3,So So and where is John Cena ? Really beautiful Island,"I saw lots of action but some really stupid moves by Ted DiBiase (Marine number 2). I know believability is not something you should look too deep for in a full action movie but the story and characters never seemed to flow right. Also this movie lacked persons you could identify with and had some level of likeability. The movie was not bad, just a let down from Marine 1. I should mention the killing of the young boy never seemed to add anything to the movie. The sniper shot was really amateur, and while he had a spotter they were out in the open and at close range, and how did they get away? When I worked at MDC we made ""RLG's"" and none had cute little fire balls that did little damage. Oh well, buy popcorn and sit and watch."
2,If they only had taugt him how to fight...,"DiBiase is a very good charismatic wrestler. As an actor, I would say that he can compare with any carboard figure in the world and come out losing. And he doesn't know how to fight. In fact, any ten year-old karate student from the school across the street can not only teach him a lot but also beat the crap out of him. Why didn't they let him wrestle the bad guys rather than throwing girl scout punches?In this movie he has to fight some Thai experts who beat him in a most disgusting way and, at the end, had him win. It's ludicrous.Among other annoying flaws of this movie: anybody acts decently and does a good job, except DiBiase, the hero. What a downer! Where were you, Tom Cena?I give this flick 2 stars, just because all other actors were superb, compared to DiBiase. Oh, and he has a few tender moments with his movie wife (beautiful actress Lara Cox) and looks awkward and out of place and is as romantic as a pine cone."
4,Plenty Of Action,"This WWE movie was good. It wasn't as good as Marine with John Cena. But if you want to see a fast paced action movie that doesn't tax your brain with a complicated plot, this is the movie. There were a few action sequences that just didn't make any sense. But I won't spoil the movie and will leave it up to the viewer to make their own opinion. But overall, it made for a good Saturday night movie and we will watch it again."
2,ok movie,"I won't go into the plot- as that has been discussed in other reviews. I rented this movie because I am a WWE fan, and I loved the John Cena Marine movie. Well.... this movie was not as good as I hoped it would be I give it a 2 1/2 star-- for it was ok. The scenery was good, the movie had action in it but I thought the plot could have been a bit better, and the movie not so slow-going in spots. The casting was good-- I liked Ted D. in the movie, and I really liked the charter boat guide."
3,Much better than the original !!,"I am an avid WWE fan but their movies have been lackluster. 12 Rounds was a huge step in the right direction but I was still skeptical of The Marine 2. Typically straight-to-dvd movies have a bad reputation. This movie looks to change that stigma. The action scenes are great and Ted Dibiase does the best job he possibly could. Dibiase has charisma and fits well in the role of a marine.I felt the movie fell with a slow build-up of the story. You should feel a connection to the characters but this is a relatively short film (90 minutes). The first 35 minutes of the movie is the build-up. Once the hotel resort is overrun by the separatists, that's when the ""real"" action begins.I would recommend this movie to those looking for a good ""B"" action film. The story is predictable, dialogue fair, and the action scenes are good. As for a letter grade, I would say B- for a straight-to-dvd film."
2,anyone agree with me,"to me near the end the action was good but for me first 10 minutes and last 20 minutes wer good but about 45 minutes of the movie it was at night time and its horrible trying tow atch who's shooting who and such in the middle of the night, i thought part one's plot was easier to fallow, yet this plot is stuff that probaly goes on over seas but deep down i was disapointed . it had its moments but i was disapointed john cena's version was better to me as far fetched as that one was, to me it was still better than this one"
1,Colossal dud!,"By the time the opening credits had finished rolling I had a pretty good idea that this movie would be a dissapointment. If you are incredibly naive and completely unfamiliar with combat tactics, incursion or recon manuevers, and plain common sense - - then you might find this movie entertaining. For most viewers this will be an insult to their intelligence. I'm no jarhead or ex-military but this director is a flat out idiot. Next time get some technical advisors for God's sake! Ten minutes of reviewing Internet clips from war torn areas of the world would give the lay person a better sense of combat realism than this director was able to muster up. What a bufoon! Don't waste your time watching this garbage."
5,Great Book!,"This is an excellent book of standard projects with unique twists. The ""extras,"" like cookie recipes and how to give a hand massage, definitely add to the book. The patterns, though short weekend projects, are NOT for beginners."
2,Much harder than described,"I have other books by Falick that are much easier and less time intensive. These projects could only be done in a weekend if your weekend lasts 30 days! The main problem is that most require very small needles, which just cannot be rushed. You better really like the patterns for the time investment needed to finish these. These are NOT for the beginner."
2,How long is her weekend?,"I am not a beginner knitter, and I knit fairly quickly, but it took me upwards of a month to knit the Union Square Poncho in this book. Which is fine, it is a lovely poncho, but it should not be in a book called Weekend Knitting! I have made the socks in this book, and they turned out great, and I also made the mittens and the leg warmers with great results (and more appropriate for a true weekend project). I would love to have the time and patience to knit the finger puppets, but I haven't yet."
4,Near the top of my list,"I love books. Books and knitting, books ON knitting. So much so that I have over 400 knitting and crochet books and magazines in my collection. If I had to narrow my collection down to 50, this book would be on it. If I had to narrow it down to 10, this book would still be on it. Love the style and quality of projects, the wonderful directions and gorgeous photos. Based on this one book, I would buy any others featuring Melanie Falick sight unseen. (And that honor is held by very few designers, maybe Debbie Bliss, Debbie Stoller, Suss Cousins and Ericka Knight.)"
3,Much Harder Than I Expected,"I am a new knitter. I thought this book would have alot more easy projects than it actually does. If you are an experienced knitter, maybe you could use it, but it is too tough for me. Many of the instructions seem unclear. I'll hold on to it, though. Maybe in a couple years I'll find it useful, but for now, it will sit on the shelf."
2,"Beautiful photos, some horrid patterns","yes, the photos are beautiful and i wanted to try many of the projects. but the patterns are unnecessarily difficult and at times impossible -- i tried making the curly toed elf slippers three times and it was a total bust. i am an experienced knitter, but this book can be quite frustrating. the washcloths do work, but the crystal palace chenille pulls, try the new manos del uraguay cotton yarn instead."
3,Brioche Hat,"I have the hat almost completed (with a little difficulty) and have had to set it aside as I am completely confused with the crown instructions. I have taken it to my local knitting store, and they had the same problem and were unable to help as they started the hat and stopped in the same place. It would be nice if somehow, I could get the information, in a clearer form, as to what the author means so I may finish the crown. I would like to finish the hat."
2,Incredible-looking items; but also impossible,"Weekend knitting? NOT. I bought this book under the assumption that I could make the projects in the book in one weekend. I am a fairly new knitter, and am very willing to try new things and more advanced stitches and patterns, but this is way over my head. There aren't even any ""difficulty"" levels associated with each pattern. Why? Because they are all off-the-chart difficult!Please beware, if you are anything less than an expert knitter, you will be frightfully intimidated and there is NO WAY you can do more than maybe one or two of the patterns in this book in a weekend."
2,NOT a beginners book,"Beautiful photos and wonderful project ideas, but none of which could be completed in a ""weekend"" AND none that could be accomplished except by an experienced knitter.Not the book for for a beginner in any stretch of the imagination! I'll stick with The Idiot's Guide for now and go back to this one in a few years."
1,Very disappointing,There is only one thing in this book worth making and that is the flower washcloth. The rest of the book was very disappointing. Would never buy this for anyone.
4,lovely,"I learned to knit with Melanie Falick's ""Kid's Knitting"" several years ago(despite the fact that I was 20). She is a brilliant writer and the items she includes in this book are all lovely and doable. The patterns are generally well written. I would have happily given this book five stars if did not have so many glaring typos. There are enough to make me think twice about all the patterns. Because of this I would not recommend this book to any beginning knitter, but at least someone who was an intermediate knitter."
5,Good book - not for beginners,"Why do people rate books like these down because they are not for a new knitter? It is a great book with easy to challenging patterns that I use all the time. And to anyone who thinks that there are typos in the book, think again. I have read this book many times and not found a single typo. Maybe they are confused with knitting abbreviations, which can be confusing.m=marker pm=place marker St=stockinette st=stitch dpn=double pointed needle CO=cast on BO=bind offThere are a lot more, so just do your best to decipher them if you don't know what they mean. Anyway, thus ends my Kid's Review of ""Weekend Knitting."" (By the way, the patterns are really fun.)"
2,Egg cozies in 2004?,"In great-grandma's day I imagine that there was time to knit finger puppets, ""egg cozies"" and checker boards. Today, however, time (especially for knitting) is precious. Perhaps that explains why my enthusiasm for a book called ""Weekend Knitting"" quickly turned to disappointment. I was looking forward to useful knitting projects (yes, I realize how pragmatic and ""un-creative"" that sounds) such as sweaters, scarves and hats, slippers, and luscious afghans; and although there were a few of these projects, there also seemed to be a good deal of repetition such as page after page of mittens with little or no variation. I knit for the love of knitting, but when I invest my time and energy I want to have something substantial and beautiful to show for it."
1,Confusing knitting directions,"I bought this book because of the weekend projects and the fun of what the results looked like. I have made the ""mitts"" and have found that the pattern is confusing. The 6 gauge pattern seems right but I wasn't successful until I used the four stitch to the inch pattern using 3 stitch to the inch yarn. The hat with the brioche stitch is a pattern with confusing directions as well in that the stripes according to the pattern are at a slant when I knit them. I've tried twice with no success. I understand that the brioche stitch is confusing and one web page I found explains how to do the yarn over, but I wish the book did in clearer form for those of us unused to the stitch.Linda Tillman"
4,"A book to make you crazy, in a good way.","I can't stop looking at this book, I love it. However, when I tried to make the lopi scarf I had to use needles three sizes bigger than they indicated. When I was asking a question about the pattern at my very hip knitting store in Portland, Oregon the whole store got into a disscussion about this book. Everyone had problems with the patterns, the pancho turned out huge and with tons of yarn left over, a very experienced knitter couldn't figure out the brioche hat. At least I feel better now about my struggle with the silly lopi scarf! In spite of the problems with the patterns, I do recommend the book. It is beautifully done, and a great inspiration for projects, but be prepared to improvise."
1,Don't even think about it,"Here's the thing (or things):1. Sometimes, player can't load MP3 or WMA CD-R, just shutting itself down in the process. We're talking single-session, finalized, good quality CD-R.2. Loading time for MP3/WMA CD-R, when it loads of course, is anywhere between 20 and 30(!) seconds. If you think it doesn't apply to subsequent loading let's say 5 min. after stop, you're wrong - it does.3. Most of the time, player can't display full info from ID tags, showing only 1st letter of album, artist or song name. That, I would say, kind of defies purpose of having ID tags.I don't think that after all the above, you'll be interested in any positive qualities of this product. Please STEER CLEAR of this Philips player."
3,sensible,"this disc-man is a little sensible.i have some problems with batteries contacts.turn off by self, sometimes"
2,Don't buy unless you read the Wonder Woman series.,"I've never read a Wonder Woman book before. What I know of her is what I've read from JLA, Superfriends, The 1970s Wonder Woman TV show, and the Justice League. This book reads as if it's incomplete. It does a fine job with the characters from Wonder Woman's home island even though they all look like and sound alike (ok, a few have different color hair)... but we are definitly missing a number of pages in the beginning and unless you read the series, you are lost at the end. I was looking forward to a good introduction to the series, but if this is how the series reads, I don't think I'd be interested in reading more."
4,Reasonably price and accurate...,"Got this item for work after seeing a similar item on Mythbuster. It came via USPS in an envelope. The item has it's own plasic orange carrying case. It came with a 9 volot battery. The unit has a blue backlight that illuminates during measuring and makes a beeping sound. After releasing the trigger, it held the value for 10 seconds before shuting off. It emits a red spot laser for aiming and can be turned off if desired. The negatives is it's only accurate on flat non-reflective surfaces. Also it had trouble reading samll heat souces. In our case we had a heater block that's 3"" square. Even with the unit up close it didn't give an accurate reading. The range is 550 deg C and we're using it in the 430 deg range. Very accurate. Picked out hot and cold spots on the heating unit which was very useful."
3,not for us,"We ordered this based on the 5-star reviews, and were quite disgruntled. Firstly, it's pretty cutesy-poo, with LOTS of real estate taken up by pictures of giraffes, teddy bears, etc., and too little space for content. Secondly, it has huge space for every possible thing in the first 6 months, then seems to lose interest - years 2-7 get 1/2 a page per year!"
2,Works great...until the tub breaks,"When I received this washer one of the rods holding up the tub was detached. I fixed this and it worked like a dream. However, a couple of weeks later another rod gave way. This one was much more difficult to fix because it was toward the front of the machine rather than toward the back where I could get a good look at it. The basic problem with this washer is that the supports that hold the rods in place are made of cheap plastic and apparently break fairly easily. The first one broke without the washer ever being used and the second broke while I was washing a bed sheet. I would not recommend this washer to any one else."
4,Tiny washer,"I was so happy to find a washer that fit in my tiny house when my 21 year old Sanyo died. The Danby spins faster than the Sanyo did, so it is easier on my dryer. I like it!"
2,Disappointed,"This product was purchased with the belief (perhaps mistakenly) that the pillow, when filled with water, would remain secure to the bottom of our spa. (In point of fact, I had believed that the pillow had suction cups built in to achieve this. Wrong).Event when filled with water as directed, the pillow floats around and gets in the way -- an obvious point when plastic is more buoyant than water.On the positive - made in the US and great quality construction. Just not was I thought is was going to be."
1,Use A Brick!,"The 'pillow' doesn't stay put, and isn't tall enough (2"") for most people. When filling with water most comes out when you TRY to close/seal the valve. DON'T waste your money. I am going to throw this out and pay $60 for a usable hot tub 'brick' which gives 4"" of height and allows the addition of pea gravel or other high density material to prevent floatation. Suction cups are equally useless, as many hot tubs are textured and prevent adhesion."
3,"Great idea, just not very durable","I thoroughly enjoyed using this product in the bath tub for the two months that it lasted. Had it not have blown apart at the seam, I would certainly have given it a five star review."
1,Disappointment,"I spent more than I wanted to trying to find a ""booster seat"" for my hot tub. At 5'1"" I need a little lift. These cushions are hard to keep under your bottom and don't raise me enough. For the cost, I expected a better product."
2,size runs large,This product was perfectly priced- it was on sale. I ordered an extra large because I like things a little big. But this was really extra large. I got it and it just was way too big. But instead of returning I gave it to someone as a Christmas gift. They love it and it fits. The quality was good and I liked the color and texture. It was a good deal-- even though it did not fit me.
1,The Worst Pocket PC Phone,"The HTH P3300 has many good characteristics, but lamentably the slow and old 200 MHz processor causes that are not possible to be taken advantage of. The function of Search in the contacts takes near 25 seconds and programs of VoIP as Skype does not work suitably. On the other hand the quality of sound in earphone is terrible, is almost impossible to understand what they speak in the other line side. My suggestion is that do not buy this device, by the price can buy a Nokia N95 that is far better in all the aspects. I am very disappointed of this gadget."
2,Excruciating,"Landow squeezes 20 pages of insight into over 400 pages of some of the most convoluted and repetitive writing to ever be labeled 'critical theory.' This book has little to do with technology or hypermedia as a form of communication. He reminds us, and again suggests, and then points out, and later reminds us again that hypermedia is different from books and periodicals printed on paper. This insight, delivered through meandering and pointless prose, often obscured by subordinate 'critical' statements, is not much of an insight. Using work done in the 1980s and 90s Landow suggests a great reconfiguring of narrative, of writing, and of authors (or authorship- but that's not clear). Much, much better books covering far more ground are ""Convergence Culture"" by Henry Jenkins and ""Radiant Textuality"" by McGann."
5,absolutely wonderful,"""because of you"", ""the hardest thing"", and ""she's out of my life"" are among the best reasons to buy this album. 98 degrees has talented members and they're gorgeous. you will not regret owning this"
4,Good wax,Doesnt smell as bad as people were writing it did but it was a little difficult getting the wax to adhere to the strips and not stick to my body. Over all good wax
4,"if you know what you're doing, it works fine.","First of all, anyone who knows what they're doing knows that you don't use strips with hard wax. That being said, this wax has a high initial melting point, and then you need to turn down the warmer. It leaves the skin smooth and doesn't flake if you spread the correct amount. If you do your pre-wax skin prep, this wax works very well."
4,A remarkable journey,The author has taken an old fable and found a remarkable new way of viewing it. I found it to be both interesting and very readable.
4,Good read,"I found this to be an enjoyable read and loved reading it.(I am not a big reader) I believe that anyone that wants a light,easy read would enjoy this book"
4,I'm thinking about gardening now,"Loved the book! It's not just a book on gardening tips. There's a lot of heart and humor in it- how the garden impacted the author's life, her family's reactions to it etc. I had just returned from a California vacation where we visited a lot of beaches. I can envision exactly how her house and garden look like, and I feel like I need a garden now to complete my life!"
5,Best book to read during winter months...,"This book is fun to read even if you are a tycoon of gardening and a great place to find the best organic growing tips - using worm castings, simplest errors of not adding enough organic material to your soil (I am also a gardener who wants quick results, investing money in plants instead of soil, will change that now...)... It is definetly one of the best gardening books I've read."
5,From the Ground Up,"What a nice book! Having lived in the Bay Area, I could immediately relate to the location. The author also beautifully captured the scene while being also giving the reader a great understanding of gardening and one's approach. I'm more of an armchair gardener than a real one and I really enjoyed the trip into a novice gardener's mind and experience."
4,Not what I expected BUT I thoroughly enjoyed it,A great book; which is not only a story but is packed with information for new gardeners. Great for those who have a good imagination
4,an easy read,"Interesting for anyone who loves gardening, novice or oldtimer. Especially fun to read if you are familiar with the Santa Cruz area."
2,boring,"story was dull, more about gardening than anything else, dragged on and on.guess it might be interesting to a gardener?"
5,trash-free teenage fun!,who needs trash to have fun? who needs an evil twin when your good-natured cousin who looks just like you can move in with your family and make life doubly exciting? who wouldn't want a classic tv star like william schallert for your dad or the lovely jean byron for your mom? throw in a geeky but not smart-alecky younger brother and you have a season full of family entertainment provided by you! great viewing. i highly recommend season 2 of this series for anyone who is sick of the current fare offered by the networks.
5,I slept on this one,"I never thought about purchasing this album, but when I listened to this CD, I was so impressed. Their music is soulful."
3,Not as good as I had hoped.,"Now, first off, I must say that 98 Degrees has a lot of talent. I love their music, but this CD just didn't cut it for me. I got this one after I got their second album...and, it just didn't measure up.""Heaven's Missing An Angel"" is the best song on the album, but it doesn't have very much to compete with. This album just doesn't seem much like the boys' style. More like it was one where the studio handpicked all of the songs...and that really brings it down."
1,blah,"This CD is so BAD! I like the one song Invisible Man, ut other than that the songs stink. They are poor excuse for pop, R&B or whatever 98 Degrees is trying so hard to be...98 Degrees and Rising is pretty good, but the traumatising songs on this record make it hard to enjoy. Trust me on this one--NOT WORTH THE EFFORT OR MONEY IT TAKES TO BUY THIS!"
1,Generic Boy Band Music...,"When will I ever learn? I bought the CD for the song ""Give me just one Night"" but, as is so often the case with modern boy bands (Backstreet Boys, Robbie Williams, Boyzone) the rest of the album is pure dreck...generic ""B"" side pablum, neither offensive nor particularly inspired. Save your money...buy the single and forget the album!"
2,"Come, on there is so much better music out there.","Why are you looking at this formulaic, over produced, vocally processed stuff. With guys who are mediocre singers at best, songs that are more formula than artistic expression. You want to hear a great ""boy band"" why don't you go get the Beatles, or the Jackson 5, or the Temptations, or want to hear some great group singing pick up something by En Vogue. Wanna hear a good singer singing great songs that they actually wrote pick up Stevie Wonder, Donnie Hathaway. Not that I'm an old fogie or anything I love new music there is just less good new stuff out there. If you want something new that is good check out Velvet Revolver, Audioslave, or if your into pop at least Christina Aguilera can sing her but off, although the songs are kind of lame. Bottom line is there are soooo many great CDs out there by some great artists why are you looking at this?"
1,A box full of Bubblegum,"Well, well, well, a box set of the lamest, woosiest music in the history of the solar system. There are other box sets of harder, better music than this total waste of time and money. There's a Led Zepplin, Metallica, Alice in Chains, you know, the good stuff. And those listed have more than just two cd's. Now that says something. It says that 98 Disease can't write intelligent enough songs to become rock legends. Please, buy something else like Slayer, Cannibal Corpse, Metallica, Pantera,Napalm Death, or Iron Maiden and dump this bubblegum box set into the box of garbage!"
5,98 degrees: bring it on,"98 degrees is the hottest boy band I have ever seen! I thought Backstreet boys were fine. The music is great too.! I totally suggest all of their CDs because they rock the world. Today, as i am writing this it is December 23 1999, they were on donny and marie and they sang to this 10 year old girl who has leukemia! That is so cute! And sweet. Just like a thing they would do! I totally think that i will never grow too old for the songs and faces of the cute, sweet, and great voices 98 degrees. And their cute sweet great smooth faces too. I am going nuts over them and i have never met them!"
5,Buy this cd now - its HOT!!!,I actually met the group while working security for one of their concerts - they put on an outstanding show - it blew me away!! They are the nicest guys ever! Right after the concert I ran out and bought the cd. They are fantastic!!! I love the entire cd!!
4,A good cd,"I like this cd. It isn't one of my favorites, but it is really good. The best songs are 'Invisible Man', 'Take my Breath Away', and 'Heaven's Missing an Angel'. In my opinion, 98 degrees sounds a lot like Boyz II Men. So, if you like Boyz II Men then you should enjoy this cd."
3,A Sleepy Cd,"I love the group 98 degrees. I bought their first CD right when it came out. So when I when I saw this CD on sale I was enthralled; I bought it right away. Then when I listened to it I was a little dissapointed because it had no upbeat songs on it. This cd is not totally bad, Invivisible Man and Dreaming are two of my favorite songs. I just think it would of been better for a few more upbeat tracks."
5,It's cool,"It's kewl! =) There's really nothing REALLY good about it, but there's nothing bad either. =) It's better than the second one...."
5,The best debut album ever,"It's true. I fell in love with their music when I heard them on radio. And when I actually SAW them, I know I'm going to be a fan forever. This CD is ALL THAT."
5,This CD sounded wonderful.,"I really love the song ""The Invisible Man"" and ""Take My Breath Away."" These guys have great voices that touches my heart and my soul. I really hope that they continue making more songs. Good Luck with making more songs. Keep up the great voices.Melissa Lim"
4,It takes a while to get used to but you'll like it....,"I bought this album about six months ago after I had listened to ""98 Degrees and Rising"" a million times. I listened to it once and I was kind of disappointed because it didn't really sound as good as the second one. Something made me pull this CD back out recently and give it another try and I really like it now. They are not just another ""boy band"" and I really hope they can find a lasting place in the R&B world because they really deserve it. I think ""98 Degrees and Rising"" is a much better CD but this is a great start. I would definitely recommend it."
5,From Boys to Men,I have liked this group forever and I love that their music puts me in the mood to relax or clean my house. This CD is my first by them but by no chance my last. Can I please have them for my birthday?
3,Nice change of pace,"I'm usually really in to rock music, but when I'm overwhelmed, this CD is a great change of pace from all the loud guitars. It's just a really pretty-sounding CD. The guys have great voices. I really like ""Invisible Man"". Their other album is a little better, but this one isn't bad."
3,Great CD,This CD is one of my favorite...I love the way 98 degrees sing...A must have cd..Buy a copy. i would recommend this one to all boyband lovers.
5,Move over Backstreet Boys! Make way for 98 Degrees. . .,"I just wanted to say how much I love this album. I got this album as a gift last Christmas, which was the best thing I ever received, except for their second album, 98 Degrees and Rising, which I also received that year. 98 is not only the best year in music, but the best group I have heard so far. All of their songs have a great impact in my life. Their message inspires me to hold on to love when I find it. I'm so glad that I'm going to one of their concerts. I get to see my idols; I get to meet my loves."
5,The best cd aside from their new cd,"I bought this cd after buying their new one. I loved their new one so much i just had to go out and get this. Some of the songs could use some improvement but overall it was really good. I really like "" Take My Breath Away"" its such a sweet song sung by such sweet guys. If you liked this cd go out and get thier new one."
3,A different sound...,"I had the new 98 degrees cds before I bought this one. I will edmit I like the newer stuff better. Still though, I love the old cd. It is 98degrees. The music style is more R&B. It is something to relax to sometime. I love ""Hand in Hand."" I think this is definely a must have for a 98 degree fan!"
5,The First CD,"this is a great cd from 98 degrees. it has a lot of slow songs commpare to the rest of their albums,but it is still amust have for a fan"
3,Not bad,"Okay, so I didn't like this as much as their other albums, but this is pretty good for a first effort. There's really no upbeat 'NSync type bomblast, but a lot of smooth, slow songs. Tracks like Invisible Man, Take My Breath Away and Heavens' Missing An Angel show the excellent voices of 98 Degrees, where as the slightly faster Dreaming and I Wanna Love You are my favorites. The factor that enhances this disc the most however, is the vocals. Nick, Jeff, Justin and Drew have awesome voices, which blend together perfectly here. Cool CD."
5,Great CD,"I love the songs and sound of 98 Degrees. The first reviewer didn't like since its not the type of music he listens to. If you're into R & B, and songs about love this is for you."
5,The Most Realistic Seafaring Supplement,"Calling it realistic may be a stretch since I'm no expert on wooden ships, but I would say that it's more realistic than any of the 3rd edition competitors I've seen.This is mostly a book for lovers of ""crunchy bits"". It has lots of good rules for expanding your characters into aquatic adventures and a lot of rules for building your own ships. I think it may be the best D&D; sailing supplement either, even knocking out the venerable Of Ships and the Sea.If you've ever thought you'd like to try a Pirates or Treasure Island campaign, then this is the book for you. The only moderate disappointment is the lack of color illustrations, but the artwork is mostly very good and none of it is bad."
3,Pretty Good!!,"I enjoyed this book. Isabelle was a likeable character, and she and Ashley Barnum were both easy to relate to. Young girls and teenagers alike would benefit from reading this book. The accounts of Isabelle's binging and purging would make this a good book to accompany a lesson on eating disorders. It was a quick and easy read that will leave you mulling over this book for days."
5,A PERFECT Read,"I actually picked this book up by accident, I read the plot summary on the back wrong but it turned out to be amazing! I would recommend it to anybody (except guys)! Read it pretty quickly!"
4,Perfect ;my favorite book,"I think this book is really good. It tells about a thirteen year-old girl struggling with ""group"" and her father's death.The book is sad and different. Natasha Friend has done really good."
5,Perfect... for moms too!,"This is an excellent book for young girls... and an important read for their mothers. Natasha Friend has created a novel that is sassy and smart while touching upon such essential issues as body image and self esteem. The text could potentially open the door for discussion for many moms with girls struggling not only with eating disorders, but also with the every day aches and pains that often accompany adolescence.This would make a perfect holiday gift!"
4,Eating disorders,"I have just finished reading this author's previous work LUSH and decided to tackle PERFECT.Perfect can be described as the anatomy of an eating disorder and more importantly how powerfully deceitful the disease can be.It is obvious that this author is slowly, but surely tackling addiction as the main theme throughout her series of books (so far).While I thoroughly enjoyed LUSH, PERFECT was a harder read for me. The main character, while the author tries to make her likeable, felt stiff and unyielding to me. Of course, this may have been deliberate on the part of the author - however, I kept trying to find something to hang on to in the story and I could not.I have, however, rated the book a 4 star for the absolutely excellent portrayal of what an eating disorder can do to the person suffering as well as the family members. Ah, denial....it is a powerful thing.This book is well written and hits all the right chords, but there was just something slightly off about it."
4,w o n d e r f u l,"I thought this book was really good,I feel that I could relateto the book. Then again many young teenage girls could probably relate due to do the high school drama. I recomend this book to anyone, even guys. The can finally understand the amount of work girls put into going to school."
3,This book was pretty good,"I was anorexic and had eating disorders for 3 years straight and this book was quite interesting, but not totally accurate. I think it would be more real if the author actually (to some degree) experienced this so she could give a better account on the feelings and battles that bulimcs go through. over all, it was okay, but not too realistic"
4,Perfect,"This book was amazing. Like the title it was perfect. I laughed, I cried, and I was amazed. This book really made me appreciate what I have. It really brought me into reallity. Perfect is a nice light summer read."
2,Teaches young girls HOW to throw up.,"The story in this book is OK and definitely will attract young girls. However, the graphic descriptions of how exactly to make yourself throw up is NOT for young readers. This book clearly describes techniques to make yourself vomit, how to use laxatives, and how to disguise the smell and sound of vomitting and to keep it secret from your family. As a school nurse, I feel that this book is too graphic for girls under the age of 14 and should only be read in a setting where an adult is available to ask questions afterwards."
3,A Fair Book,"Perfect is a very good book. Thirteen year old Isabelle Lee is caught in the meshes of Bulimia, while at the same time, is fighting off the lump of greif in her throught due of the death of her father. When her mother demmands she regularly attend Group Counceling, Isabelle grows upset and defiant, but goes along with it, only to discover that the most popular girl from school, Ashley Barnum, is bulimic as well. The two team up, becoming friends through their bulimic-bond. I would suggestthis book to any girl struggling with Bulimia or Anorexia Nervosa herself, but for me, it was not my cup of tea."
4,some real cons,"I loved this book for the atmosphere, and all the reasons mentioned by the others, and yet, when i read this as a preteen, I had never heard of Bulimia, and this book gave me all i needed to experiment with it some!"
2,"""Why""","As a reader, I find it increasingly more difficult to determine whether I want to see and digest the contents of a book before I read it. I am of the opinion that once someone sees, hears, or feels something repeatedly, the shock value wears off and the person begins to accept it as normal. Why do authors targeting youg readers find it necessary to insert sexually shocking scenes into their work. The book is certainly well written and appealing, however, I would not want to recommend it to the audience it targets because I do not want to promote, homosexual relationships, internet porn, nor sexual threesome ""romps"". Authors like this one will be held accountalbe for helping to demoralize this country."
2,Too cliche,"The positives first--Perfect is the only convincing book I've read about bulimia. It handles the subject maturely and manages to balance it with other plot elements.Now, the negatives--The whole ""my dad died"" plot is so overused and so trite, and there is nothing original about Isabelle's grief. She hid one of her father's old shirts in her closet...hasn't everyone heard of this a thousand times before?There were also the issues of the characters immaturity...calling her sister 'Ape Face' really wasn't so cute the first time, and seriously annoying by the end.All in all, fine to read if you're very, very bored and it's your only option...any other time, pick up something better.Cheers."
1,Unrealistic.,"This book was very unrealistic.It annoyed me from the very beginning. It is simple to tell that the author knows nothing about eating disorders.An eating disorder is something someone has for life. Yes, they can control it, but by the end, this girl was suddenly ""cured"" of her bulimia.Also, overused events. Average girl vs. popular girl, then becoming friends, as well as the whole ""Perfect, prettiest girl in school"". Dead parent. Annoying siblings, ratting on you. No creativity.And, if anyone is curious, I do have an eating disorder."
1,perfect is deffinitally unperfect....,umm this book is horrible..this book has hints for having an eating disorder if you want your kid having problems like isabelles then get your kid this book.. but if you dont want your kid having to deal with balemia and almost getting raped then dont let our child read this bookk...
4,K&N air filter,"Part arrived when it was supposed to, in good shape. It arrives ""dry"" and no oil is included in the box. New purchasers should be aware that it arrives unoiled. You also need to order the oil necessary to make it work. K&N filters are a premium priced product and this is an additional expense that must be taken into account. I think the advertisements should have a caveat stating that filters are shipped dry and require the additional purchase of the proper oil before the first use."
2,does not fit,Does not fit a standard 289 Mustang engine; only the 289 Hi Po. Does not fit as dedcribed in the auto lookup feature. Filter is still high quality!
1,Not recommended,"I bought these shoes and they only lasted four months. The leather sole was REALLY slippery and never did make it easy to walk with them on. By the last month i had them, the sole had totally separated from the upper. I thought Florsheim shoes were good; maybe years ago, but not now. These shoes are NOT recommended at all."
2,I Received the wrong size.,"The box said 8.5 Triple E, but the shoes were 9.5 regulars. I purchased another pair at local business."
1,"Florsheim Men's Victor Slip-on, Black, 7.5 EEE",I am so disappointed. Its with is narrower than stated but its lenghth is longer than stated around 1 size.
2,These sure dont look like florsheim's,"This is the worst pair of florsheims I've ever had and I've had plenty. The construction looks cheap and the sizes are a bit off. I ordered several pairs, one for my father and two for two of my uncles, nobody seems to be happy with theirs.They were priced very cheap...I suppose you get what you pay for. Still, bad choice for $30..."
3,"Great movie, mediocre DVD","I was a junior in high school when 'Arthur' came out, and thought Dudley Moore was the cutest thing. The movie is funny, the music is cool, and Liza Minelli is great.So why only 3 stars? Because the only way you can see this movie is by buying this 1997 fullscreen release, and that just won't cut it on today's HD widescreen TVs. I'd love to see a remastered anamorphic widescreen version, that would rock! And I think a lot of people would buy it. What do you guys think?"
4,Charming Funny and witty Dudley best,"Poor alcoholic rich boy makes good. Dudley Moore was at is maximum charm with this performance. He brightened each scene with his antics and his subtle remarks. The man who never worked could have everything, including the beautiful Susan, a marriage arranged by their families. But then he met and unorthodox young female who had just been caught shoplifting, a common sort, and she changed his life.When I heard about Dudley becoming ill this is the movie I immediately thought of."
4,No title,"I listened to a radio review about the new Arthur movie and they said the original movie is better, that's why I purchased it. Now I have to see the new version but let me tell you, this movie with Dudley Moore and Liza Minelli was very good and hilarious. It's a keeper. Good acting, too!"
4,GOOD FUN!,Hadn't seen this for many years and was surprised how much we enjoyed it after so long. I always thought Liza Minelli was an odd choice for the part of Linda but I guess it worked because the characters were meant to be very different from one another. I don't think the story has dated at all - still a really watchable movie. Cute and cuddly Dudley Moore was perfect in the part and John Gielgud was excellent. (I think it's better than the remake.)
4,Only for people with a good sense of humor!,"This one's in my top 10 of funniest movies ever! The character of Arthur Bach is so adorable, so lovable, you just don't CARE that he's an irresponsible drunk! In fact, I hope in my own mind that Arthur never got sober or found an AA group that would take him... he's just too precious as a lush! LOL! Loved Liza in the role and Sir John was Academy Award quality for sure."
3,Why buy this video?,This movie is shown on free TV about once a week. It is about a drunk guy who spends a lot of his time slurring his speech and burping. The object of his affection (besides his liquor) is Liza Minelli. That should be proof enough that booze impairs your thinking.
1,"Dudley Moore is a SCARY DRUNK from dry town, USA!!!",I saw this movie as a child and have yet to get those macabre images of Moore from my memory. Never have i seen a movie in which a drunk is depicted in such a scary manner. Alright i'm just kidding!!! But why is ARTHUR in the horror section?
5,Still hilarious,"The creators of ""Arthur"" cagily walked a thin line between fantasy and reality in this wonderfully funny dual love story. (The makers of the sequel lacked their ingenuity.) This is Dudley Moore's peak performance in films. And what can ya say about John Gielgud, who pockets the movie as soon as he enters it. Additionally, while not getting as many of the zingy one-liners as the guys, Liza Minnelli is a total charmer. The entire cast seems to be having a ball: Jill Eikenberry as the vapid fiance, Barney Martin as Liza's slobby dad, Stephen Elliott as Jill's scary dad, and Geraldine Fitzgerald (""Peanuts!"") as the raunchy rich aunt. If you can suspend contemporary concerns and attitudes about alcoholism, for a couple of hours, I can't see how ""Arthur"" would fail to amuse you."
4,"Wonderful Comedy, But...","""Arthur"" remains wonderfully entertaining after more than 20 years, although a DVD remaster would be appreciated (""Arthur"" was one of Warner's earliest DVD releases).Also, contrary to an earlier review Dudley Moore did not win an Oscar for his performance. He was nominated for Best Actor but lost to Henry Fonda for ""On Golden Pond."""
3,not the oiginal,brand is good in this remake but his supportiing cast is lacking and this ruins what could have been a decent remakemy take stick to the original and you cant lose
2,"Good Movie, Poor DVD","This is a nice DVD, if you don't mind that 27.9 percent of the original theatrical image has been removed for the DVD exhibition, so that the DVD image fills your entire 4:3 television screen (theatrical aspect ratio - 1.85:1; DVD aspect ratio - 4:3). If you're okay with that, enjoy!"
3,Too Bad It's Full Screen,"Although the cinematography is not the best part of this movie, I guess most people would still want to see it in its entirety, not in its modified full screen format, which happens to this US release. To get this movie in widescreen, buy the UK release instead, and this is really too bad for a movie which is American. 2 stars deducted."
4,"Arthur, He Does As He Pleases.....","This movie is terrific! Highly recommended. On reason why it got 4 stars instead of 5, is because the DVD is in Full-Screen, not Wide-Screen."
5,"Arthur Arthur, Arthur!","FANTASTIC!A must watch again and again! Watching it again @ Amazon Instant vid!Dudley and Liza @ their Best in NYC! Hey, the best that they can do is fall in love! :)"
2,Drunken Fairy Tale,"It's hard to feel positively about lead character Arthur (Dudley Moore) in this movie - basically a rich overgrown spoiled rotten drunk with non-stop teenage one-liners. We get to watch him make a fool of himself for most of the movie, with the exception of the period when his personal assistant dies. Liza Minnelli isn't very interesting either. The plot is about as thin and uninteresting as possible - rich boy supposed to marry rich girl or lose his inheritance. She loves him (ridiculous), he doesn't love her and marries waitress. Grandmother relents and he keeps inheritance. Basically a waste of time -"
5,necessary,"If you are a middle english buff then you need this book. it is excellent, concise, informative, and simply necessary if you want to read the old manuscripts in the original. I recommend purchase of this one."
5,Good value,This comforter is not thick or heavy but very comfortable to sleep under. The gold is a pleasant tone and does not look cheap. It is easy to coordinate drapes.
3,Comforter set,The size is although mentioned King but the comforter appears to be little smaller. the material is synthetic and the pillows had some stich problems. Otherwise great value for the money.
3,"Good writing, OK coverage","This undergrad text is very clear and Bollobas has a friendly style of writing. The coverage, though, is rather narrow and there are no applications. So I like Kreyszig better."
3,misleading,has a list of comedic stars that are not even in this particular dvd..such as stephan fry and hugh laurie...but was stillok..
5,One of my favorites,"When I bought this album, I was looking for a classic Christmas album for a small ensemble. This fits the bill admirably. The music, arrangements and performers are all of the same caliber as Shaw's other recordings (such as The Many Moods of Christmas) but here we have the intimacy of a small ensemble, much more fitting to the music than the massive forces of the Atlanta Symphony Chorus.The arrangements are by Alice Parker and Robert Shaw, dating from the 1950's. We also have a number of magnificent solo voices, which are absent from the Robert Russel Bennet arrangements. The soloists are superb.If I had to pick a single Christmas album to see me through the holidays, it would be a difficult choice, but this would certainly be on my short list."
5,A Pure Acappella Delight,"I am something of a purist, and prefer my Christmas Carols without all the bells and whistles provided by orchestral accompaniments: I like simple SATB acappella singing. This album has it, and it is, of course, conducted by the great American conducting genius, Robert Shaw. Priceless."
2,all the songs sound the same,"Everything is well sung, but the whole CD sounds the same. There's almost a militant quality to the way the songs are sung -so regimented, no character, no variation, no stand-out soloists. I was hoping to hear a little more 4-part harmony and less singing in unison. I was very disappointed because this was NOT what I was looking for. I am surprised that this CD is rated so highly,(which is why I bought it). I gave this CD to my mom who likes any hymns -regardless of how they are sung."
4,Beautiful classical style,"I gave this cd as a gift and actually had a chance to listen to it. It was beautiful and Iliked the long list of well known songs. It has a more classical, conservative approach-in the sense that there aren't silly songs (i saw mama kissing santa claus, etc...) But Ienjoyed it enough to buy myself a copy!"
4,Too often looked over,"My friend taped a few Reagan Youth songs for me way back in the day. I liked them a lot, especially ""Beutiful Day"" which sounded to me like it was describing the design of a Grateful Dead t-shirt. Who knows? Maybe it was.Good dose of New York style hardcore; loud, fast, snotty. Check it out."
4,Fantastic album...... until about two/thirds through,"Until the track ""Jesus Was A Communist,"" this is a flawless, breakneck speed early 80's hardcore disc. After that point, it gets a bit too metal-ish for my taste (I mean, come on.... there's practically a guitar solo on What Will the Neighbors Think.)So, I gave this 4 Stars instead of 5. Additionally, I gave it 4 instead of 3 because it's an important piece of musical history (which I'm sure that Reagan Youth would find pretty funny) and because the first 11 tracks are so great."
4,Bedtime for Bonzo,"If you are a fan of 80's hardcore, there is no reason for you to not own this cd. While some people may complain about the change in song structures towards the end of the album, I think it makes for a better listen. This collection of songs is a perfect introduction to what hardcore used to be, and you can even see the metal influence creeping in toward the end of the cd. It has been said that Reagan Youth were adding the metal sounds as more of a joke than anything, but it still makes for an intriguing listen."
3,FIRST HALF OF THIS ALBUM IS REALLY GREAT,"When I first heard this CD I was really impressed. I was really enjoying the catchy old school hardcore punk tunes like ""Reagan Youth"", ""New Arayns"", ""(Are You) Happy?"", ""No Class"", and ""USA"". Then suddenly about halfway through the CD everything went downhill. Honestly the second half isn't as good as the first half. So all in all if you like old hardcore punk then check this out, but be prepared for some not so great songs alongside the great songs."
2,Recording nuh good,"this would be a fantastic CD as the songs are great, if you could hear them. The recording is substandard and my advice would be to buy other Cd's with a better sound quality. No reflection on Sparrow,the #1."
5,Awesome Beginer harp,I realy enjoy this harp. It has great sound quality for the size. Its not super loud but has good tone. The size is also perfect for storing when I'm not using it in my small appartment. I would highly recomend this harp for someone who is starting out!
3,Not a grammar book,"I was expecting a book with such a title to provide an overview of Romanian grammar. It doesn't. It is just a phrase book (with some good material on Romanian culture). It is a good phrasebook, but don't expect to get an understanding of the structure of the language from this book. That being said, I do appreciate the way that pronunciation is indicated (something that is missing from the the Romanian grammar book I bought at the same time)."
2,"Not really a ""Learn Romanian"" book","I have bought a small set of books to learn the Romanian language and this seems to be the least useful of them.It's not a book that will teach you the language - it will only provide you phrases that will be useful if you want to spend some days in Romania and be minimally understood. If you really want to learn the language by yourself, it should be really a better idea to buy some method (I particularly like the one from Assimil, which has an option with audio from the lessons spoken by native Romanians), a Romanian grammar (the one from Christina Hoffman is very helpful) and a good dictionary. This one is just for tourists."
3,Speaking Romanian with an accent,"OK, they do try to give me a clue to how the words sound when spoken by giving me a pseudo-phonetic hint. But many times, the hint would have me saying the words incorrectly. I know this because my wife is Romanian and I've tried to say a few of the phrases the way the hint implies ... only to be laughed at.Teaching me to say the words incorrectly doesn't inspire a lot of confidence in the book. But I guess it was based on the language courses for the U.S. Foreign Service Personnel. It's just a good thing that many of the Romanians these government employees will face know English.For example, to say ""I'd like to eat,"" the book tells me to say ""ahsh vree-AH sa ma-NUNK."" Well, I'd be closer to how the Romanians say it if that last word had been ""ma-NINK.""But overall, it's a half-way decent traveler's Romanian. And I can tell them I'm an American ... though, using the pronunciation in this book as a guide, I don't think they'll have any trouble guessing that I am."
2,Romanian,I found this book to be a little out of date when I went to Romania and the terms were old school
3,Romanian nice and easy; nice and easy,"This is a pleasant little book to use in conjunction with other Romanian study. If I were to suggest an improvement, it would be for more and more frequent review questions."
2,Some of the translations are just wrong,but the pronunciation is good. I didn't bother to bring this with me when I moved to Romania if that tells you anything.
2,romanian made easy,well i am not done with it yet but from where i'm at it is really helpful and easy to use as is stated in the name.
2,Enormous! and clunky!,"Perhaps I should have read the description more carefully, but my expectation was that these would be delicate silver earrings. (Hey, maybe doorknocker should have meant something to me...but live, shop and learn!)These earrings are HUGE! I'm 5 feet 8 inches tall and 135 lbs, so I'm no Audrey Hepburn, but these are enormous, showgirl earrings meant to be seen all the way from the backrow.In addition, while they are nice, big, shiny earrings, they also appear to be nice, BIG, shiny earrings on tiny, fragile stems to go through the ears. In fact, the stems are so small and soft that even if these earrings were my style, I would be afraid to wear them for fear that the stems would crack leaving me scuttling to retrieve earrings I don't even like.Hmmm, perhaps something to ""regift"" to a flashier friend for a costume party."
3,It's ok,Not really as detailed as i expected it to be. The factory manual that was supplied for free with my mountain bike was more helpful in showing me step by step how to remove and re-install my brakes and derailleurs.This book is Good for beginners who wish to do minor maintenance.
4,An Excellent Reference on German Tanks,"This book is an excellent reference on German Tanks, their variants, armor and capabilities. If you are interested in World War II or writing a World War II book, then this reference is a great starting point."
5,Awesome Informational Book,"One of the best books on the subject I've seen. It's full of great pictures and information regarding German Tanks from WWII. The student I bought this for opened the book and proceeded to get lost in it, literally. It's his favorite subject and this book was just perfect. Before I wrapped it for him, my husband looked through it and was enjoying it as well!"
5,German tanks in 2 hours,"If you want to know about WWII German tanks in 2 hours, this book is it. It won't tell you all about one tank, nor it is like an encyclopedia of pictures and specs. It is a coffee table book on German tanks, even WWII buffs won't mind refreshing their knowledge with. After equipping myself with many of the technical books of Walter J. Spielberger on German tanks, I was still be glad to have this book on my shelf. Don't expect much, it's a brief summary on German tanks, but quite well done."
4,"Nice book, very pretty pictures.","Nice coffee table book. I got it mostly for browsing, not because I am planning any new decorating. It has some very interstsing ideas, not practical for me but nice to view."
1,Poory written,"I read everything with words on it, this book was hard to read, lacked any kind of flow , and had no real plot. I was just so disappointed. Amateurs will feel accomplished if they read this because they will think it was a hard read and they got through it, avid readers will know it was just a bad book."
1,They wouldn't get a single star if I had a choice.,I STILL haven't received it yet ! @#$##@@#$ or a repsonse to my e-mail. You're F@#kin with the wrong bull kids.
4,New toy for baby,"The tambourine is a hit with our son. I'd give it 5 stars but the decoration is not painted on, but instead a sticker (which began peeling before we even received the tambourine. Misleading because the description talks about the non toxic paint. No sticker doesn't seem to deter our son though."
3,disappointed that Italian Handicraft is Made in China,"The tambourine is cute, but I am concerned for its longevity. I've bought several other Italian made instruments for my son, so I was surprised to find that this Italian toy was made in China. Can it really be an Italian toy if it was made in a different country? I also could not identify any reason why this tambourine is more eco-friendly than any other."
2,Would have thought it to be more durable,"Cute tambourine. Pleasant sound. But my 9 month old banged it with a wooden block (not sharp) and the top of the tambourine ripped. Considering it's designed for kids and to take some banging, you would have thought it to be more durable."
3,If you like seafoam...,"This watch has a ton of great features, but I agree with some of the other reviews in the point that the black background makes the face difficult to read. The indiglo must be used, even in the daylight. Also, I was expecting an apple green and it's really more of a pale seafoam. The multiple alarms are nice and it's a solid ""medium"" size of watch. Not my everyday watch, but good for outdoors and vacations."
2,Timex green ironman/triathlon watch,"I bought this watch to use when I run. As almost all timex watches its design is very nice, light and practical, BUT on this model you CAN'T see the time unless you use the indiglo button day or night. The numbers are definitely not as bright as they appear on the screen of the computer. You have to move the watch to get direct light on it or else you don't see anything - most likely because of the black background.I should have returned it for a different background color. I'm not going to recommend to buy any watch with this black background color."
4,Nice well-designed shoe,"Shoe sole is a little stiff, though. I got it as a gift for my sister, so I can't really say how comfortable it is!"
1,I thought that I could trust Verbatim,HP OEM cartridges are so expensive! I have been looking for a less expensive alternative.I have used Verbatim media in the past with success so I thought that I could trust that their cartridges would be quality.I purchased both a magenta and a black cartridge and both leaked.
5,"Is Garlic an Aphrodisiac? No, But It's Close!","Keep those garlic recipes coming! Recipes to satisfy the soul and titilate the taste buds! Some may dislike Garlic's flavor, but if you're a lover then this cook book should be a permanent addition to your cooking library."
5,Mary the Mother of Jesus - Stations of the Cross,"I enjoy using this book while praying theStations of the Cross because Mary walksyou through each and every step of herjourney as she shared her last day withher son, Jesus Christ."
2,Not Impressed with this Study Guide.,"This Study Guide contains the exact same questions that are in the student's textbook at the end of each Chapter. I thought this product would be different questions that the student could use to help prepare themselves for a test. It was nothing like that. It also does not have the answers, so when studying at home with your student, the parent still needs to look up all of the answers in the textbook."
2,Not able to finish,I hate to say this but I couldn't finish this book. Normally a book this size takes me an hour and a half to read. This is my fourth day with this book and I simply can't get through it. I simply can't seem to make myself care what happens to these characters. The concept is good. The delivery needs a tiny bit of work.
4,item details,"Item details are misleading . it says that it has a metal bowl which is incorrect , it has a metal shield , and this is not acceptable to ABS as i found out the hard way ."
4,Frank Reyes el principe de la bachata,"si quieres oir bachata buena, entonces no busques mas y compra este cd porque aqui si hay musica buena.. frank reyes deberia de ser el Rey de la bachata y no el Principe..."
3,Stevie on cruise control,"Bootleg-type recording, reasonable sound quality, mix not too hot. Strangely starts with a track from a different show from the rest of the CD. Good track selection with some rareties live, i.e., Itchycoo Park and Natural Born Boogie. ""Uncle Jim"" sings more than on Dingwalls sounding pleasant, if a bit generic. Some bluesy harmonica (Watch Your Step) and blues guitar (Five Long Years) which is rare for live Stevie on CD. Great patter in between songs (not really for the family -- ""you've made three old tossers very 'appy"" is his expression of gratitude to the audience)."
4,Easter Story,Very happy to find a copy of this animated bible story that we watched with our daughter and now want to pass it on to beautiful grand daughters!
4,"""recommended at the price"".. as in ""killer queen""",pretty good i guess.. got what i payed for. it was nice watching it for a true fan but do not pay more than a couple of bucks for this item. it was a well put together homemade interview dvd. pretty good for the price.
5,Great Information,"It is critical to understand sociology, economy, archaeology etc.. when studying scripture. This book is amazing how it ties everything together.I highly recommend for the curious, lay and clergy persons."
4,NEw York Hardcore,"I have excellent news for the world, this album has all the original Kraut songs on it. Back from the days of CB's and saturday afternoon shows there, and other punk venues too numerous to mention in this paragraph. These boys could whip out some hardcore diddys. Not P-Diddy mind you. But punk rock and roll music. Doug Holland's guitar sounds like the German 6th Army at Stalingrad. Davey Gunners vocals completely intertwine into a blistering punk necromancy. They opened for the Clash and now they open the doors to perception. DAVEY GUNNER I SALUTE YOU! ALL RISE, QUIET!!!"
3,Very thin,The vee neck is as I expected but the shirts are very thin...not suitable for outer wear. Wearing on the outside will be embarrassing.
5,Just what I expected,"With a reasonable price and fast shipping, the classic Hanes undershirt is a good value. They are quite durable and I have never had one wear out on me."
5,Hanes V Neck T-Shirt 3 Pack - 777,The t-shirts were the same quality as you would get in the store and were not seconds.
1,Hanes,Product advertised and then after paying for them they were not available. Tied up money for over two weeks before refund credited back. Bad experience.
1,these are going straight to the charity bin,I was really disappointed with these undershirts. They are the thinnest undershirts I've ever seen and would never have purchased them if I had seen them first. If I put my fingers inside the shirt I can see them through it. They resemble a t-shirt you have had for 20 years and can't bear to throw out because of sentimental value. I have no attachment to these and they will be going right to the Good Will bin.
3,Very good,"It's a very nice product, decent quality for the price paid. I would recommend this shirts. The material allows to breath and get a freshness sensation"
2,you get what you pay for,"Hanes provides an acceptable product, and yet I find myself tossing the Hanes t-shirt back into the drawer whenever I have a clean Jockey t-shirt. The Hanes fabric is less dense and less soft than the Jockey fabric. You decide, of course, but I won't be buying Hanes if I can afford not to. You really do get what you pay for."
4,Cool toy... popular with boys,"Bought two for my sons and then a few more for their friends' birthdays. Quite popular with boys, as it plays music while moves accordingly. Pretty durable as well."
2,REMOTES ARE SHORT LIVED,"Yes, the station is a must have for the 05 series, but be seriously warned . . . . I have had three stations, 2 of the remotes have died so far, and both after the 30 day warranty, and ARCHOS tell me that since I did not purchase it from them it is not their problem and I am waiting to see if any Amazon merchants will source or sell the remotes only . . . . by the way, just in case you don't know, the station is all but useless without the remote."
2,Understand What You're Getting,"A ""DVR"" without a tuner seems hardly worthwhile. You can't connect your cable to the unit, you're going to have something else to tune and convert your cable signal to composite, RGB, or S-Video. Then you're going to have to carefully position the IR emitter of the Archos DVR station so that it's pointed into the IR receiver of your tuner. In all likelihood this means you can't put the DVR station where you want it.You'll be better off without this. Get a tuner for your computer, use it as your DVR and transfer the recordings via USB."
1,NO SOFTWARE SUPPORT FOR THIS PRODUCT,"The TV Program Guide for the 605, necessary for recording content, has been discontinued by Archos. Without this support this product ONLY permits the Archos 605 play content on another monitor."
5,john,"excellent product, let's you record your favorite tv shows onto your pvr, then you can watch the content of your pvr on your tv screen, tv shows,movies, and music i am very happy with the utility and functionality of this product,works great"
4,archos dvr station gen 5,This thing is awesome. Allows you to record tv. it comes with a remote also which is cool when you have it outputing to a tv or monitor that is larger... you can surf the web or just control the whole device with the remote.
5,been looking for this product for a long time,its great will work on my 404 or the 605 love it was a good deal will put it to use.
1,DVR kills the battery,"A word of caution for the DVR unit. Leaving the archos 605 docked to a plugged-in DVR 24/7 will kill the battery. My 605 160gb was perfect for about a year. Then , i left it on the DVR for week straight, something i've never done before, and the battery only lasted 5 minutes after that. Before, I got a few hours of video time. Apparently, you're not supposed to leave the unit plugged in and attached to AC power for long periods of time. Which to me, makes no sense for a DVR, a funciton that relies on always being connected (and on ac power) to record shows throughout the week/month untli you're ready to watch on the go."
3,The Archos DVR Docking Station - Stellar Product,"The DVR Dock is an excellent compliment to the Archos 605, it instantly transforms it into a truly multimedia appliance, extending its functionality and capabilities immensely, setting up the dock and configuring it was very intuitive, just snap tab A into slot B, the IR remote prove to be simple to operate, all in all very straight forward setup and operation.All cables and connectors were included, no need to run out and get extra items to get you up and running, when combined with the 605, the record quality is outstanding, even from a non-digital set, in the final analysis, this is a great product, flexible, intutive, robust and an outstanding compliment to the 605."
3,Not user Friendly,Drections are somewhat difficult to decifer! Still trying to master it for cable TV. Recording direct from source works quite simply! In ad it is not clear if this will work with archos 604 wifi.
5,Great product and does its job,I got what I expected this device to work. It is easy and just plugthe cables and ready to go with the Archos 605 device.
5,Great mini-tivo!,"The Archos DVR station is a must-have companion to the archos 605. It, overcourse, does not have all the features tivo does, but for the low price and no monthly payments, I'll take it any day. It also allows you to do everything you can do on your archos, on your home tv which i have found especially nifty. I can surf the web, listen to music,etc - all on my tv. Its a total must have!"
3,Good Product,I like the Gen5 Dock for the Archos. I had to send it to the manufacturerbecause some of the functions didn't work. I hope that this is just a fluke and not the products performance.
3,Not impressed for the price.,"The product works ok. I think it's overpiced for what it does. I use the docking station with the 504.I like that convenience of the docking station. The remote is compact and has good range.I didn't like the fact that you have to choose the video output format in the Archos player. The docking station and player should be able to determine the best available output and display that. If the component video cables are plugged in, the default output format should be component. So, whatever video cable you plug in for the output, that should be set automatically. However, it doesn't do that. You have to manually set the output display in the player.I expected more from something that is priced so high. No component inputs or s-video input."
1,archos dvr station,still have not figured how it works after 4 months. i even bought the extra plug ins for 50 bucks
4,"I like the product, but would work better if amazon shipped the 605 to go with it.",I don't really know if the item works or not because of problems with Archos and amazon. I'm one of the people that pre-ordered and didn't get it. I hope it works(I've heard that is work great from others that have used it)
2,Brand New still waiting on Archos 605 160GB,I really don't know how yet because I did not get the shipment for the product Archos 605 160GB to use it. I hope 2 use it someday
1,No brass tacks suggestions that I could find,"First let me say that I consider myself to be a strong Christian. However, even I felt this book was a bit condescending. The tone of the book would be fine if the publisher had chosen to be upfront about what you could expect to find within it but the exterior of the book leads you to believe you are going to find some tips and techniques about getting your homeschool organized. This book is much more of a ""mind set"" about being organized and relying on your faith to help you attain what you are seeking. I'm fine with that premise but that's not why I picked up this book.If you are basically organized and are looking for support in what you already know, this book might be for you. If you were not born organized and you are seeking actual suggestions to help you create a peaceful homeschool environment, I'd recommend finding another book."
3,Good book but condescending at times.,"I am a relatively organized person and this book did give me some new ideas on doing better which were easy to implement. The only problem I had with the book is that the author is very opinionated. According to her, I have too much time on my hands because I read more than five books a month. Isn't one of the main goals of homeschooling to foster a love of reading in our children and wouldn't modeling our love of reading be a good thing. The author is lucky that I do read more than five books a month or I never would have gotten around to reading hers. You can get good info out of this book but just be ready for some strong personal opinions."
4,"Great Book, Be Patient on Action Items","This book is geared toward getting at the cause of why we resist organization. It deals with heart issues and in exchange convinces you how crucial it is to step up and take responsibility for your life and organize it. I'm about halfway through it and am just now getting to some practical ideas that can be applied to our homeschool I very much appreciate the author's push toward the ""why's"" of organizing. She really wants to highlight patterns of thought and motivate change from the deepest levels of who we are and how we think. This book brings hope for doing things better in the future. We're not stuck in a rut. We don't have to hang our choices on our ""personality type"" and never improve. The author gives us a road map of heart and then behavior changes that gets us to an orderly, purposeful life. Great read...but take your time digesting this one."
1,Not what it says it is at all,I never would have purchased this book if the description or back cover comments had told me what the book was really about. This is a very religious book with a hint of organizational methods thrown in. This is a complete waste of money if you are really lookiing for organizational tips. If you want bible lessons and a lot of preaching this is the book for you. I am hoping I can return it because it was sold with what I consider a very dishonest description in order to get people's money and lure them unwittingly into a lecture on god. Any other book on this topic would have to be better for a non christian.
1,This is encouraging?,"I wanted to like this book, I really did. Heaven knows I have been weary of my disorganization. I picked this up at a used curriculum sale and bought it based on the title without first glancing at the contents. If I had, I wouldn't have bought it, even at the ""bargain"" price. There may be good hints in it, but I could not get past the first two chapters to find them. I had to put the book down. The tone in this book is extremely arrogant, as if the author is yelling at the reader. (There are exclamation marks everywhere!) If the goal of this book is to encourage a disorganized person like me into making changes, it fails. Maybe some people like to get beat up, but I'm not one of them."
2,too complicated,"This book is way complicated. I really didn't even read it too much, it confused me."
3,"Not bad, not great","I was so looking forward to the release of this DVD after seeing it advertised. Have to say, I'm a little disappointed.The story is good - coming to grips with one's sexuality is always an interesting one - but I felt it went on a little too long. After awhile, I started to get annoyed with the lead character and wanted to shout ""Grow up already!"" The acting wasn't always the greatest, and sometimes the sound didn't come through at all.So it could have been better, but it wasn't terrible. A good effort."
1,Full of cliches,"Seriously don't get this DVD; it is really bad. The acting, the editing, and the script are all terrible. I made the mistake of buying this and the sequel and forced myself to sit through both but then tossed them. Really not good."
1,Finding Who?,"This movie was horrible from beginning to end I only watched after the first few minutes to see if it would get better no such luck Dont waste your money folks, I did. The campiness and queenieness and the loud mouth female character are over the top. The main character is weird. I kept asking myself, Who would take the time to make something so awful!"
1,1 hour and 55 minutes of my life that I'll never get back,My partner and I bought this movie because we thought it would be a great movie to watch on date night. Boy were we wrong. At first we thought that it was just bad acting but then we realized it was bad acting AND bad writing. Whoever gave this more than 1 star must be friends of the actors or also thought that Soul Plane was a great movie as well.The characters were undeveloped. The storyline was horrible. The only good part was the sex scene.We've decided to use this movie as a glass coaster. That's all its good for.
5,Speaks to the soul,"For a young gay black male with a west indian and african background raised in america this story is so true..... i don't want to give to much away but the emotions and actions made by many black males struggling to be ourselves and love ourselves and know what we want this is the best movie to say i felt just like that sometimes. I am past the phase that the main character is portraying in this movie but watching it made me laugh and mutter under my breath cause it showed life in a realistic way. And thankfully he had some good friends like most do to lift him back up when he needed it. I am glad I bought it and it will be a favorite, my friends are already asking if I am going to watch it on movie night with them."
2,truthfully,"I honestly never thought black gay acting could get any worse than ""Noah's Arc..."" I stand corrected.It was as if the casting call was for:""Anyone interested in a role in an independent movie*NO PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE NECESSARY*(just come audition ya'll)""The overall flow from scene to scene was erratic. The writing has a lot of room for growth. & it even seemed as though the whole movie was shot in ONE take...""ya'll better get this scene right the first time, no do-overs.""But, I give it 2 stars for originality & for being such a bold effort. I could never sit through watching it again but, the writer definitely has potential...I think he just needs a budget."
4,"Young Man finding hisself with the help of a loving,caring established Man!","I thought the movie was great because it dealt with issues most young people go thru. Not use to seeing gay men in relationships, or wanting to be in one. It has broaden my outlook on seeing this in my day to day life."
1,No so much,no so much for me it jut felt a lil dry for me I kept waiting for something anything but nothing captured me
2,Too much talking and too much bad acting,"""Finding me"" is a film for people, who look for handsome bodies with cute faces. And nothing more than that.Even if the storyline isn't dull, the way its told is boring. Some of the scenes could have been cut out. The lead character is sooooo damn irritating I really had to stop myself from pressing the ""stop"" button before the end.Fortunately, there are many better ""coming-to-terms-with-own-sexuality"" films available, so rent this one before you decide to buy it."
3,Good story,"Finding Me is Roger S. Omeus' directorial debut. The film revolves around Faybien, a young Black man who on the surface seems to have it all going on for him: he is young, beautiful, and has good friends. Don't let that fool you. Under neath all the hipness of his (external) life is a painful experience. Faybien is battling a homophobic father who taunts him, and in return Faybien grew self hating. But when he meets a self loving gay Black man named Lonnie, things change. Lonnie challenges Faybien's dull life by making him confront his own demons. But the harder Lonnie pushes, the more complicated Faybien's life becomes. The film is one of the handful gay films of color. As such, one can overlook the inexperience of its cast and crew. There is a lot to be desired on the acting, technical and the very image of the film. However, it gets two thumps up for a good story and the wonderful addition it is on the gay films of color section on any bookstore."
3,"For the most part, I could relate to the struggle of attempting to come to terms with being homosexual.","However, after a certain point the movie just seemed to drag on and on and on. Faybien's character just became to over the top. And I am sure he straight up forgot his lines more than once, lol. Amerra and Lonnie's characters were the most believable. She is someone I would love to hang out with and he is a cool dude I would befriend in a heartbeat. I am not sure why it ended like it did. I was not able to understand what took place in order for Faybien to ""find himself."" There was no real resolution once he came out to his father and why he would not accept Lonnie's repeated attempts to be there for him and help him through this ordeal I still don't get either. I felt sorry for Loonie. That was me in real life a couple years back. Does anyone know where I can find the poem that Loonie recited in the movie? I think it is called, ""Now Aint That Love?"" I can't find it anywhere online."
3,Ballads of a Bohemian,"I purchased 2 separate copies of this book. Both orders were filled quickly and response from Amazon was good. Both copies are in reasonably good condition considering they date from 1921 (used books).Covers are firm, pages in good shape. Prices were also reasonable."
1,IS THIS A JOKE!!!,like is this for real ??? really .... like is this for real cause i mean i know a sucker is born every minute but holy crap
4,"(almost) perfect, like all arc'teryx","first of all: this is not a warm jacket. that's not what it is designed for. it's mostly a light precipitation jacket, and it does a great job keeping that away. arc'teryx is so expensive because you et what you pay for. only reason it's not 5 stars is the inside could be softer and it could be more wind resistant. otherwise, a great jacket"
1,Wrong!,"This book was written in 1992 shortly after the fall of the USSR. The first line in this book is : ""In a few years, at the most, Cuba won't be Cuba anymore - the sole Socialist state in Latin America."" Whoops!I found this book hilarious! It's super condescending and just goes on and on about how stubborn and stupid Castro is for thinking he can continue his Socialist state and how naive that is. Their big plan for 'transition' was for Castro to sell off every major utility and all means of manufacturing to the U.S.The authors wrote in a very confident, almost arrogant way, which is frankly quite amusing with the luxury of retrospect on my side. None of the authors' predictions came true."
3,"Peformance ****, Recording has some techinal flaws","It's really a lost art. Gone are the days when top flight soul singers toured with a full ochestra. The '70's concerts on the R&B scene benefited from the Jazz era (in this case, the big band era) performers. Believe me, you never hear anything like the Marvin's backup band today.Marvin Gaye was never completely comfortable on stage. His vocals here rarely rises to the full zenith witness on vinly. But then again by the time of ""Let's Get it On"", Gaye had adopted a laid-back approach(which latter on influenced Frankie Beverley) to his music and it is very evident on this live recording.Highlights on the album are ""Trouble Man"", ""Distant Lover"" and '60's medley suite. The two big hits are nothing special and pale considerably to the studio versions.For the most part the audio quality is fine, if not a little ""too sweet"". But even this new remastered CD contains the same annoying mic feedbacks found on the orignal LP."
4,Gaye Live,"Live is from Marvin Gaye's 1973 comeback concert in Oakland. He had not performed live in almost two years at that point and he is a little nervous about his performance. He shouldn't have worried as he is in top form. He runs through most of his current hits from the time with ""Trouble Man"", ""Inner City Blues"" and ""Distant Lover"" standing out. The album contains the only appearance of his ode to his lover ""Jan"". He seems to strain a bit on the ""Fossil Medley"" and the album's closers ""Let's Get It On"" and ""What's Going On"". Overall, it is another great album from Mr. Gaye."
4,GOOD BUY,"I was very pleased with the Delivery time. I was also very satisfied with the CD. I have run into on occasions, a CD, that had the picture of the Artist, but when I received the CD, it was not the original artist. This CD was the real thing. I would tell a friend. The only reason why I did not give this CD a 5 star rating, is because I did notice a few songs ended a couple of seconds early, or the ending was a slight bit differnt from the Album. I guess this happened because the CD was Remastered. I can live with this."
2,Not quite up to par,"This DVD contains some useful information, but is sorely lacking in direction. The production of the product appears very amateurish, with both camera work and voice recording leaving a lot to be desired. For someone with a prior knowledge of classical homeopathy it was quite painful to watch."
1,Poor Quality,"This book fell apart within a couple of months after I beagn using it. I taped the pages together but now they have torn away from the cover. Also, there are not very many spaces to write your own anecdotes about your baby. The book prompts you to finish their sentences but gives you little room to put in your own narratives."
4,Perfect addition to John Lennon Set,"I have this memory book for my dd who is now 2, and am registering for it for baby #2. The pages are easy to fill out and gets all the pertinent info. I have had no problems with it falling apart. Fits perfectly into John Lennon keepsake box with baby hat, hospital bands, etc."
4,Better than average,This was my first book by this author. I would try other books by Parker based on this one. Most of the characters had major flaws along with wonderful characteristics. The only problem I had with the book was Susan. I didn't like her and had a problem with John going to work with her in the end. She needed to take responsibility for her actions.
3,A Disappointment,"I enjoyed two of Mr. Parker's previous novels, Pacific Heat and Laguna Heat, but I was a little disappointed in The Triggerman's Dance. The premise was believable (wilder things have been reported in the news recently), but the actions and dialog of the characters seemed stiff and contrived. The action scenes were good, but not strong enough to carry this book past average."
2,"Hackneyed, heavy handed fantasy writing","There's actually a good story here, which in the hands of a decent writer might have been turned into something really good. Unlike his namesake Robert, this Parker's writing is cringingly bad, with cartoon characters and heavy handed lines. His FBI is political fantasy, both in terms of characters (yeah right, a Jew, woman and WASP), character and politics (what happened to the FBI involved in 'dirty tricks,' assassination of civil rights figures and unlawful and warrantless surveillance?). When I read Parker's first novel, Laguna Heat, I said to myself, ""mediocre local (Laguna Beach) author."" This, his fifth, showed not much had changed."
3,"Good writing, interesting plot, disappointing end","I enjoyed this book a lot. It was engaging and interesting to read. Parker writes very well, and the characters snapped me to attention from the very start. But in the end, I was so disappointed by the ending. Everything unfolds exactly as you expect it will. No big surprises. No reveal. It just happens and ""The End"". I was just a bit let down after that much build-up."
2,Didn't work,When I assembled the fan to the motor and installed it it wouldn't turn because the fan part didn't seat all the way. I had to take the fan off the old unit and put it on the new motor.
3,Checked out the authors work,I really enjoyed a previous book from this author but I am not loving this one. Not enough to keep my interest.
2,Obscure and dull,"A disappointing read after loving ""We Need to talk about Kevin."" The narrative had an ironic tone which I found off-putting and dull - didn't finish it."
4,A multidimensional woman.,"Grey is a fascinating woman. She is strong and has a dominant position in archeology, a world dominated by men. Yet she falls for Raphael, a man who then all but destroys her. As the story progresses, we are told the story of her eccentric relationship from her early days. She had remained in the field and become enmeshed with a mercurial man who had established himself as a Demi- god.. I think thar shrivel does a difficult job of explicating the story of a woman who trips on herself."
1,Confused,"One of my favorite books is ""We Need to Talk About Kevin."" I bought this book based on the author. I can't believe it is written by the same person. Where in Kevin, the sentences were so beautifully structured and haunting, the sentences in this book seems to be written by a teenager. The book does not flow and I am completely bored. I can't even finish it. I am very disappointed."
5,Great little guidebook,"I ordered this before our second trip to Venice. We had toured St. Mark's the other ""must-see"" attractions on an earlier trip. This time were planning to stay for a week and were interested in getting into some of the neighborhoods away from St. Mark's Square and the Rialto Bridge. We had the time to explore so armed with this and a good street map we covered the city pretty thoroughly.The book is small which makes it nicely portable. It has interesting anecdotes and historical backgrounds which make for good reading on the trans-Atlantic flight. And the restaurant recommendations were right on--at least the ones we tried.This does not replace a comprehensive guidebook to Venice (I like the Insight Guide) but its a great portable book for someone who wants to explore Venice neighborhoods."
4,Very usefull,I am planning my holidays to Venice and I found the book very interesting.In a city were you can do all your visits on foot is very usefull a guide so detailed and easy to read. I am sure that following it I will not miss anything!!
1,GREAT READ,"THIS IS AN EXCELLENT SOURCE FOR THE HISTORY, THE CULTURE AND THE EXPERIENCE OF VENICE. THIS IS NOT A STOP AND SHOP GUIDE.I APPRECIATE KNOWING WHERE I AM AND WHY I AM THERE IN TERMS OF THE HISTORY, ARCHITECTURE AND CULTURE. TOO MANY GUIDES HIT ONLY THE HIGH SPOTS AND TOO MANY TOURISTS LIKE IT THAT WAY.IF YOU ARE SERIOUS ABOUT EXPERIENCING VENICE THIS IS A GREAT READ FOR YOU.B. WALTER"
1,Board Split - manufacturer warranty void,"We bought this board after a recommendation from Cooks Illustrated. We really it, until it started splitting down the middle after a couple months. We always dried the board standing up, and it wasn't sitting in water ever.[...]"
3,Spliting at glue joints,"I've owned this board for about one year. It's surface is durable, and doesn't show knife marks much. However it has split on the glue lines and has slightly warped also. For this price even though a nice looking board I certainly would expect more longivity from it. It has never been wet other than washing it then drying it immediately with a towel and lays flat on my counter top all the time, no excuse for splitting as far as I'm concerned just poor quality in the glueing."
2,Conga Board,Unfortunately this lovely board arrived with a 2inch long crack in one end and the crack went al the way through the board. It was a wide enough crack that bacteria would probably spend a lifetime within and I'd never be able to sanitize the board completely. I notice others have remarked that their boards had cracks (or were warped). Why is this? Why isn't the maker of this board looking into the problem?
3,just okay,"I've had this board for about three months. It looks very nice and I haven't had a warping problem like some others have had.I have two main complaints about this board, though. It's a little small! After dicing two or three onions, you are starting to run out of space. The other issue is that there isn't anything on the bottom that keeps this from sliding. I put another cutting board under this, that has rubber pieces on the ends."
2,Got a warped one!,"I read good things about this board in Cook's Illustrated, so I picked one up to use as a second board. I do most of my cooking on a huge Boos Rock Maple board and wanted to replace my smaller board with something nice.Unfortunately, my board came in warped, as other people warned about. The warp is quite bad - in two directions so it wasn't stable on either side.Real shame - the board is very attractive and it feels and smells nice.Any, I just returned it. Maybe I'll try the Totally Bamboo Flat Grain - from what I have read it it thicker, but more solid than this one."
4,Good Value,"For the longest time, I had my heart set on a nice maple butcher block. OK, I'm exaggerating...I've wanted one since Alton Brown said that they were the best. But, I was willing to give this bamboo cutting board a chance once I saw the price of the aforementioned butcher block.I wouldn't really know how to compare this to other cutting boards so I'll make some high level observations. First, it hasn't cracked (unlike every other wood cutting board that I've ever purchased). Second, since bamboo is so hard, the board has remained relatively unmarred despite daily use (with my Wustof knives). Finally, it is an attractive board and the size is just right for the veggies that I find myself cutting."
2,Cracked within months,"I purchased this board on the recommendation of Cooks Illustrated. I was really pleased with this board - for a few months. I oiled it as recommended, but it split in two places after about 3 months. Their ad specifically says it will not split or crack. I wrote to Totally Bamboo, and they are replacing the board for a new $6 shipping charge. In the meantime, it has warped badly and is difficult to use. I will see how the new one holds up."
1,Prone to Cracking,"I used this cutting board for about 6 months before it started to split down the middle. I had only washed by hand and had applied mineral oil consistently. I exchanged the cutting board for a new one, which arrived in the mail with a split already in it. That was enough to convince me that the first splitting was not a fluke and that this very nice looking cutting board doesn't actually hold up for very long."
1,"Cracked first board, cracked second board (before using!)","We received this board as a wedding gift. It arrived in good shape but when we took it out to use for the first time, it had already cracked. When I contacted the company for a replacement, they sent another one, which was cracked beneath the sticker that wraps the board. I'm disappointed by this product b/c it was so highly recommended by Cooks Illustrated."
5,UK Psych Classic - Late 60s,"The Velvet Opera hit the UK charts just once with their blazing ""Flames"" and released two LPs, the best of which are compiled here with four unreleased bonus tracks (eg. title track from an obscure film). What makes the band so interesting are the individual members - the rhythm section (Hudson & Ford) went on to the Strawbs, penning their highest charting hit, Part of the Union, and a four LP solo career (two singles hit the charts - Pick Up The Pieces and Floating On The Wind). Elmer regrouped and fronted Stretch, a progressive hard rock band that did better in Europe than in the UK. This same band was the unfortunate choice to go onto the road in the US, headlining as ""Fleetwood Mac"" - the result of band and management conflicts. There are several excellent songs on this collection, well worth exploring."
5,The nudity from girls makes this worth watching,"In the 24th century, Intergalactic Space Travel has become a reality. One of the first outposts in the far reaches of space is Watcher's Nest - an inflation hole drive portal which has recently come under attack by a mysterious force known as GHOUL."
1,Don't waste your money.,I purchased this escutcheon when I purchased a new Delta faucet for my kitchen. It arrived without the bracket and gaskets necessary to install. Useless! Will return both.
5,Powerful Art by Children.,"Looking at the powerful, direct images in this book is like seeing into the minds of the kids who made them. Their concerns over issues like pollution, greed and fairness come across with unfiltered, startling force--and beauty. Artist/teacher Richard Mock knows how to offer up printmaking tools that give his students the confidence and skills to make their messages clear. This is a marvelous book for all people--big and small--who care about art and the world we live in."
4,One of the Best Pro-Business Hollywood Speeches Ever,"Alright, this is a cheesy movie and there is too little of Marilyn Monroe to make it worth buying if that's all you're looking for (but she looks hot at 24-years-old and in a tight sweater). But it does have businessman John McFarland (played by Donald Crisp) giving one of the best pro-market speeches ever. It's on par with Danny DeVito's great speech in _Other People's Money_."
1,Easy to use but we still have mites.,Purchased Eradimite for a new kitten who came home from the shelter with earmites. Poor guy still has earmites and now our adult cat has them too. I'm still treating them both but we plan to take them to the vet to see if they can recommend something different for my itchy-eared guys.
5,Great book! Highly recommended.,"I haven't gotten a chance to finish this book yet, but it's been awesome so far. I really like it, and I'm glad I bought it."
3,Unsure,"I already own The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly - Extended Cut (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)I've waited 3 years for the other Leone movies to come out on the Collector's Editions...Now I have to decide what to do.Should I buy the three movies separately or buy the entire box set? Buying them individually would be cheaper...but will I lose out on anything by doing this and not buying the entire edition?I don't know what to do...can anyone comment?"
5,Where's the postcards!,"I'm glad I didn't dump my copy of the previous ""collectors edition"" of G/B/U when I first pre-ordered this set, because the cool set of postcards reproducing international posters is NOT included in this set.Does anyone know if the individual ""collectors edition"" releases of the other films, FOD/FFDM & Duck You Sucker come with any such goodies?So five stars for the discs, but four for leaving out the postcards..."
4,Recommend Doctor Copernicus for those who enjoy historical novels,Enjoyed this historical novel -- liked the somewhat unusual writing style. Only negative for me was the too-drawn-out ending of Dr. Copernicus on his deathbed.
2,Not for the casual traveler to Germany looking for WW2 sites,If you are looking for an easy-to-follow guide book highlighting some of the key WWII sites to visit in Europe then I don't recommend this book. If you are a die-hard military buff looking for detailed and laboriously researched information about WWII battles along the border of France and Germany in the Belgium and Luxembourg area then you will appreciate this book.Take a close look at the image of the back page to see the actual area covered by this book.
3,Could use more detail,"Fairly useful, but more detail, especially maps, are needed to help one from getting lost when touring the area. The many eyewitness accounts are appreciated."
2,Hard to follow,The directions in the book were hard to follow. I got lost and wasted a lot of time using the book. The maps were useless. My copy of the book is in a trash can in Belgium.
3,The real story,"This is a fairly good account of the different battles and I especially wanted it for the account of St. Vith, Belgium. While it was a good account some difficulty tying it together. Would also like to note that a common error says the monument of the Engineers at St. Vith is that of Col. Riggs who indeed commanded a group of scraped together men who arrived there but the monument was put there by the 168th Engineers in 1992 who were part of that ragtag group that held back the attack before more men arrived. I helped the 168th dedicate the monument with their association in the woods where they fought the Germans back inDec. 1944this is not to take away from Col. Riggs and the 81st Engineers who were part of that same group but to give credit to the men who erected it for all of them."
5,"Ignore the detractors, this album is awesome...","...if you want a band to always stay the same and never evolve, there are plenty of stuck in a rut indie-bands for you to follow. This gifted band tried something new, and it really worked. The songwriting is awesome, the musicianship top notch...and yeah, there is sort of a New Order/Human League vibe on this album, but I don't really see that as a problem.I would say this is an early candidate for one of the top album of the year slots (Particularly in a year in which a lot of returning artists have disappointed), and certainly another great find by mighty Merge Records."
3,More Kelly Crisp,"Tracks with Kelly's vocals are superior. Most have Ivan singing lead, and they generally lack an ""edge."""
3,Huh? What happened to the Rosebuds?,"I love the Rosebuds, just love em. There isn't a more underrated band out there, and Birds Make Good Neighbors is one of my favorite albums ever. I can and do play it over and over again. So I was foaming at the mouth for their new CD and bought it the day it came out. I was very disappointed. The drum machines, the disco-y dancing stuff, the pseudo-Abba/Armed Forces... it doesn't work, not at all. It was heartbreaking to listen to. That said, there are some good songs here. ""Silja Line"" is as good as a Rosebuds tune that there is. It's just a shame there isn't more like it. Ivan and Kelly...if you're listening...come back to good old fashioned rock/pop and leave the disco ball behind!!!"
2,Disco is Dead,Highly dissapointedness. I liked the first two then they come out with this crappy mix of disco and eighties dance music.
4,So Far No Complaints,"I just received this travel system. I'm not due until early August, but have put it together. It was very easy to assemble, I didn't even have to look at the ""distractions"". This seems to be a very sturdy travel system, I don't see any problems with it, but then again, I have yet to put baby in it. It does not seem to heavy right now, but we will see how I feel in a couple of months. I like the pattern, it is not gender specific. The material seems easy enough to clean. I will update my opinions once I have used it for awhile with my new baby."
2,Neede huge hands to drink from this,The glasses are beautiful but it takes an awfully large hand to hold the glass properly. I probably should have measured the size before ordering.Purchased through Amazon.
4,"Excellent, Meets the Gemmell Standard of First 2 Books",I enjoyed the first 2 books in the Drenai Tales Series and have become a fan of David Gemmell. I was disappointed to read a rather shallow highbrow review of this book and almost chose not to buy it. I am glad I did. Not only was the book in keeping with the standard set by the previous 2 books. I believed it added a new dimension to the series.
4,An splendid edition to the drenai series,"If you thought things could'nt get any more exciting after King Beyond the Gate, then you were wrong. This book seems to be the last of the Drenai stories (cronologically) and explains what happens after the Nadir, led by Tennaka, conquers the Drenai. It tells the story of the poor Drenai heroes struggling to confront the Nadir rule. The conclusion works well and finnishes niceley, leaving room for the next episode in this unforgettable series!!"
3,Bit of a Letdown,"Can't really recommend this book, I'm sorry to say. I found the storyline shallow and the characters dull and one dimensional (except for Salida). As much as I love Gemmell's writing, I found this story to fall far short of the first two Legend books.The saving grace for the book is the fast paced read. This story zips right along, and even if you don't enjoy the story, you WILL enjoy the fighting. There are some good combat descriptions, though again not as well done as the first two books.If you must buy it, buy it used."
5,A REAL bass player!!!,"Bass players respect other players who play the bass and the bass guitar particularly when they play both well. MM is slamming on both. Most know of him because of work he does with other ""big"" name arists. MM's first release has several great tunes. Outer Drive has rec'd lots of airplay on Smoot Jazz formats. My favorite is Bottom Line for the slamming bass riffs and the clean horn sound of Roy Haynes. The story behind Keys To My Heart will make you cry. It was my inspiration to buy the CD when I saw MM play with Kirk Whalum. Now that I have seen him perform his own set, can't wait to go listen to it again. Get This! NOW!"
4,early historical novel of California,"I got this book from a convent sale, It is a novel of the earliest days of California of Pioneers that came from Spain and Mexico to build a life: a great city. San Franciso now but the City of St. Francis then. Wonderful events and characters and I only wish someone would make it into a movie.... loved it fast read.."
1,Not compatible with MP800,"You know the old saying: if the price sounds too good to be true, it probably is. I am not sure about the other printers listed for these cartridges but do not buy this brand of cartridges (G&G) for Canon MP 800 unless it has the chip. The printer will not recognize the cartridges without the chip. This was a big waste of time and trouble for the seller and the buyer. Before advertising on Amazon the seller should have should have tested the cartridges instead of taking the manufacture's word (G&G).The seller in this case did give me a RMA number to return the cartridges. I will have to wait and see if they credit the returns on my credit card."
2,I expected more,"I am a huge RUSH and Neil Peart fan, and was very excited when I heard about and ordered this book. A few of the shots were amazing (sawdust on the china for instance.) Unfortunately, the great shots are few and far between. A few of the out of focus pics are cool, but an entire book of them is overkill. It seems also that only Freddy G is quoted. I would have preferred more variety, words from Gump or Geddy and Alex, and images of the collaborating as well. It just seems that with the unlimited access Carrie Nuttall was afforded, she could have done more than take ""artsy"" versions of pics we've seen before. Here's hoping the Roadshow Illustradted Companion gives us a little more."
1,Disappointing,"Even as a huge Rush and Neil Peart fan, I was really disappointed by this book. Some of the pictures are just plain awful!"
3,Some cool shots,"If you've gotta have everything peart, then you will probably read the reviews and purchase it regardless of others input. There are definitely some good shots in this book, but don't expect this to have any intriguing or Peart-esque narrative. This is a photo shoot done by his new wife (hottie, way to go Neal)."
1,Don't buy this item!,"Two very obvious problems with this product!!First, I received the product in an unsealed container, and it said it should contain 4 tests (1 bacteria, 1 lead/pesticide, 1 nitrate, 1 ph/hardness). It was missing the nitrate test (I had a duplicate ph/hardness test instead). I called Amazon and they shipped me another one (free - good customer service), only to find it had the same problem (unsealed box and had no nitrate test, duplicate ph/hardness tests). I figured I at least got a 8 tests out of the deal, even though I still haven't received a Nitrate test.My second issue is that I just noticed that BOTH boxes have an expiration sticker that says ""Exp July 2009"" over top of a sticker that says ""Exp March 2007"" and a final actual expiration stamp of ""Feb 2006"". I have no idea if I can even trust the results.Don't be fooled - find another product!"
4,"Good Little Test, Be Aware of What You're Buying","No much news on the item, other than it tests as advertised and works fine. Be aware that this will tell you if you have particular things IN your water, not now much of those things you have. For that, you would need to order the kind of test that you send a sample of water to a lab."
1,Missing test strip,"My test kit arrived but was missing the hardness test strip. Since this is why I ordered it, the kit is useless to me."
3,Needs better instructions,I am of average intelligence but you must read the instructions very carefully including the comas. It is very easy to misunderstand and spoil a test thus making the whole kit useless. I was lucky and caught what I misread.
5,Works Perfectly,Quick and easy to use with an assortment of measurements. Much more than what I needed it for which was to test water hardness.
3,To be honest...,"I never used this test kit. It was not necessary. The water quality is fine where I live and in my house. With that being the case, I cannot rate this item. So I will give it 3 stars. 1 star would be unfair and 5 stars would be a false rating. If I do ever use this test kit I will modify my review."
4,water testing,It was nice but it failed to tell me what I wanted to know...if my water was safe to drink. I forget which test it was but it was inconclusive.
1,The kit was not sealed and missing 5 test kit.,"As same as a previous review of the other customer there is the only test kit was in the package but missing E-coli, Nitrates, Chlorine, hardness and ph."
4,"Seems To Work, But Who Knows?","I have used this test for the well water at my place. It is exactly the same as the WaterSafe test kit selling for twice as much - contents, instructions, everything - except lacking the tests for Copper and Iron. Instructions are easy to follow, and results are pretty clear. Some colors are hard to match up with the charts, but it gives a pretty good indication if you have a problem. I hope, anyway - without a professional test to comapre with, I really have no way to be sure."
1,"looks good out of the box, but-","I liked the looks of this boot out of the box. I wore the boots around the house for a couple of times, then went for a walk. By the time I was a half mile from home I was having trouble with the right boot in the heel area. By the time I turned around and arrived back home I had worn the hide off both feet above the heel with blood on my sock on the right foot. I don't think I ever had a worse experience with a boot. As you draw up the laces it feels like there is something behind the heel area much like a fish line cutting into your skin."
1,Worst pair of shoe's i have ever purchased,I have had the shoe less than 2 months and these boots have a hole in the toe...i had another pair of HI-TEC and they were good. This pair is TRASH...i wasted 50 bucks..
2,"Very dark, strange movie","I've watched many movies that try to convey a Christian message, and this has to be the oddest one I've ever seen. A man has the opportunity to contact people who will die in two days, including his wife, with a phone that can contact people in the past. The lighting is dim and the continuity from scene to scene is choppy and difficult to follow in several progressions of the plot. It's only about 40 minutes long and I think they could have cut out a lot of it (especially the parts of the rat running around which added nothing to the story) and still have gotten the message (share the gospel) across. I liked the ending with the business meetings and the counsel to the man served with divorce papers, and it did have an important message, but I can't recommend it as highly as other films."
5,Creative way to teach bible stories,"My 1-year old son enjoys this book because it has creative touch and feel images like a crocodile and sand. He actually lets me read through the entire book which rarely happens with other books. The text is brief to keep little ones attention; yet, it embraces the main idea of each story. On days when my son is willing to listen to more, I can easily add more detail from the original scriptures."
2,Kind of strange...,"This is a nice book with a good message. The problem I have with it is that the reading level is way beyond the age that it seems geared for. A touch and feel book seems like it would be geared towards 0-3 year olds but the text is from the Bible and isn't ""baby friendly."" There's nothing wrong with it but it just doesn't seem like a book you would read to a baby."
3,Dora Talking House Bedroom Set,"My four year old wanted the Dora Talking House and furniture sets for Christmas. The bed has a nice feature in that you push a button and a second spring-loaded bunk bed pops up. However, Dora falls off the top bunk, because the bunk lowers from the added extra weight of the Dora figure. An adult has to carefully balance Dora on the top bunk for a young child. The other accessories include a teddy bear, night stand with attached lamp, rug, and chest. They are solid plastic and do not have any additonal features. My daughter likes the teddy bear best of all. The dollhouse is wonderful, and we do not regret purchasing this bedroom set for it."
3,An O.K. product for the house.,"I of course, had to buy this to go with the dora talking house that we bought last year. I thought that this would be a great, durable fisher price toy, but it turns out that the bed that turns into a 'bunk' bed dosnt quite hold any figurine on top of it. its not sturdy. you can put a figurine on the bottom, but not on the top. it wont hold them. I think that was very cheap and obviously not well thought out. the rest of the accesories that come with that bunch are fine though. but be prepared to be upset with the bunk bed if you buy this!"
3,TO LITTLE SPACE,MY DAUGHTER LOVES THIS DOLLHOUSE I WAS JUST ABLE TO FIND THE BEDROOM FURNITURE OF OF E-BAY AT A RESAONABLE PRICE ANYWAY I DIDN'T RELIZE HOW BIG THE FURNITURE IS THEY SHOULD OF MADE THE UPSTAIRS A LITTLE BIG THE FURNITURE LOOKS BULKY AND IT DOSEN'T CLOSE WITH THE FURNITURE IN IT ANYWAY MY DAUGHTER LOVES THIS TOY SHE 3 THIS IS ONE OF HER FAVORITE CHRISTMAS PRESENT
3,"Good material, bad presentation","The information is a great database for packaging design, but, it comes in a very thin paper. As you use, handle it, you'll feel as if your book is melting in your hands. And you'll miss a CD-ROM with the patterns, in a vetorial format. I have no idea why they didn't provide that."
5,Great book!,I am a graphic art major and we barely went over this book for one assignment designing a package. I enjoyed using these patterns so much that I bought the book just to experiment with. It has a ton of unique and creative packaging patterns as well as all the basics. I would recommend this book to anyone for any reason!
4,Wonderful Book of Patterns,The patterns in this book are fantastic - a great book for designers of all types. My only wish is that it came with a CD ROM of the patterns.
3,there are others worth hearing,"""ti non dimentichero"" is pretty good, but most of the tracks are just long, beg for the listener's attention, and quite mediocre. the songs are somewhat rock (a la gianluca grignani) but heavily influenced by pop. i think this album is directed for an easy-listening crowd. i'd rather listen to gialuca grignani for soul-wrenching lyrics or tiziano ferro when i want some erotic, r&b influenced beats."
4,"Terrific movie, terrific cast, terrific soundtrack. Terrific","Who says they don't make nice, intimate films anymore? ""Liberty Heights"" is a movie that deserves a bigger audience than it eventually got. Barry Levinson has written a film with plenty of sweet moments--the mating dance between a Jewish boy and black girl, the sobering realization that the ideal girl isn't everything she seems to be, and the deep bond between family. Levinson elicits strong performances from Ben Foster, Adrien Brody, and the rest of the spirited cast. This is a film well worth renting (or buying eventually)."
3,Arrowhead Mills puffed corn,First time I tried it. I don't like the puffed corn as well as the puffed wheat and rice. It's similar to Sugar Puffs without all the added sugar and is a whole grain. You probably want to try just one bag and see how well your family likes it before buying such a large quantity.
5,Better Than Popcorn,"I've long hated popcorn because it got stuck in my teeth and sometime you hit a hard kernel and thought your filling was going to pop right off!I've purchased this cereal thinking it would be a great morning meal, and it is, but I use it much more as a snack. You could add seasonings to it to spice up, but I like it plain and I even bring it to the movies. Good healthy snack a better choice than popcorn, at least for me."
4,Makes the BEST caramel corn EVER,"On its own I wouldn't eat it. I agree...It's chewy, as if it's stale.But...I used it as a healthier alternative to caramel puff corn (like cheetos without the cheese) and it made the absolute best caramel corn on the face of the planet. Seriously. This stuff is $2/bag at the only store where I can find it, so this is a much better price."
4,Don't Compare to Conventional Cereals...!,"Tough?!? Ah, C'mon, you can't compare this to Cap'n Crunch, for heaven's sake..! This one is all-natural, and has no preservatives -- sure, it's going to get a bit tough once it's open. To combat that, just put the bowl of cereal (dry) into the microwave for 20 - 30 seconds... let cool, and then enjoy - voila! (This can be done with any cereal that goes stale, btw).It's really good combined with yogurt and fruit.Seriously, don't compare this with the over-processed, preservative-laden stuff in the grocery stores. Zap it and give it a shot!"
5,"Good product, great price","I use Arrowhead Mills Puffed Corn for breakfast and snacks. This cereal as great fiber supplier does not have salt or sugar added. Moreover, it tastes good.I bought this product from the Shoppers for $2.00 to $2.25 per bag plus tax. Amazon's low price, free tax, and free shipping are real saving."
5,Great snack,I like this cereal as a substitute for popcorn. I hate getting the little kernel things from popcorn stuck in my gums so this is a wonderful alternative.
4,Make up your own mind,"Freedom of the Press is rightly enshrined because it gives you and me free access to all the happenings around us. The theory is that an informed public will do a good job of choosing its leaders and ensuring its survival.Bernard Goldberg makes the argument that we are being misled by the press.If you value your own freedom, read this book and make up your own mind.This is not a time for kneejerk reactions. Read the book for yourself."
3,Good points,"Goldberg is right on with his assertions of bias in the media. Both sides of issues should be represented with each side getting an equal voice. We supposedly have a free media in America, but news has a definite slant in one direction or the other. Presenting both sides of an issue is an impossibility even when the networks DO attempt to interview everyone; the network still leaves you in no doubt as to its own opinion. Perhaps we should get androids to report the news instead of anchormen"
3,"Good, but has some serious omissions","The author gives numerous examples of liberal media bias. The theme is not much different than ""Bias"" but this book has more depth (I would suggest skipping ""Bias"" and instead just getting this book). I think he went on too long about the response to his previous book (and fails to point out that Al Franken found a serious legitimate flaw in ""Bias""). While he has some good examples, he omits many that disprove his thesis such as: yes the Pew Report does say jounralists are more liberal on social issues - BUT it also says they are not on financial issues; the Pew Report also shows that Gore received more negative media coverage than Bush; and that owners of newspapers tend to be conservative; Bush got more newspaper endorsements than Gore. I agree with Jon Stewart that it seems the media is more biased towards sensationalism than anything else."
1,Right on!,"The author is right on about the arrogance of the elite media like Fox News, the Washington Times, and the Wall Street Journal, for if they had not parroted President Bush's false claims about WMD, we would never have entered the ill-fated Iraq War. Instead, we are in a war, which seems to have no end in sight. What arrogance!!!"
1,I second the Daily Howler posters,"Well, I was going to post a review that mentioned the Daily Howler's excellent articles on this book, but I see I have already been beaten to it. I don't, however, notice any comments from those who like the book as to their opinions of the articles written by Bob Somerby at that website. You really should check them out; they may change at least some of your opinions of Goldberg."
4,In depth analysis,"""Bias"" blew the lid off the subject of bias in the big media and ""Arrogance"" is an excellent follow up to that title for those who want to go deeper and understand more about this profoundly important subject."
5,A great book,"This is a great book, despite its flaws (too sarcastic in spots, some points not fleshed out). That an insider like Goldberg should break ranks is almost a miracle. Which is why I think his ultimate goal for this book will fail: hoping the liberal media will read it and change their ways. The condescending liberals he takes to task share at least one other trait than arrogance, and that is R-I-G-I-D-I-T-Y!!!!!! Rigidity. Trying to convert the rigid and inflexible is to tilt at windmills. But I still loved this book, for who doesn't admire Don Quixote? We could use more Don Quixotes these days."
5,Another Homerun from Goldberg,"This is a terrific addition to the literature concerning the growing bias and arrogance of America's national media. One need only to scan a few of the major networks news broadcasts or pick up a national newspaper to see the bias writ large. It is so blatant and ""in your face"" now that its existence can no longer be denied."
5,"Answers WHY they do it; ""Journalistic Fraud"" tells you HOW","Bernard Goldberg does a brilliant job of answering the question WHY the media elite distorts the news to reflect their liberal ideologies. But complete the picture with this riveting and entertaining companion work, the book that tells you HOW they do it: ""Journalistic Fraud: How The New York Times Distorts the News,"" available here at Amazon.com."
4,The pot calling the kettle black...,"Most of the arguments Goldberg presents are essentially the same as those in his last book, _Bias_. I gave that book 4-stars as well because it was too vitriolic. This time he had the decency to downplay his own martyrdom. Still, he is at times trite and petty. His point is well-taken (even if I don't agree), but his presentation leaves the reader feeling a bit icky for lack of a better word. It is worth reading, but not phenomenal."
3,Same as Bias only more of the same,"This is a follow-up book to his book Bias about the liberal bias in the media. Arrogance gives more proof of the existence of bias, more spiteful comments about people he's mad at, typical issues with typical examples, offers no serious solution and serves to annoy liberals as well as conservatives who already know everything he could possibly say. Read Bias and stop there. This book offers nothing new to the discussion."
4,Enlightened,"Was hard to put down, enjoyed almost every minute. The media has slowly made it's way to the point it's at now, and the people are fed up with it. Was in a way unexpected hearing this voice coming out of the CBS world. This is an insiders witness to the elite media. Smooth read. Contains interveiw with Bob Costas. Not just for Conservatives!"
2,A letdown after BIAS,"I was expecting much more after having read Goldberg's previous book, Bias, which I thoroughly enjoyed. His second book on the subject of how the media is biased against conservatives is disappointing. It doesn't read easily and is often repetitive and unoriginal. While I applaud his effort to help us understand just how those in control of the national mainstream media are warping the news to fit their agendas, I cannot recommend this book. Sorry, Mr. Goldberg."
2,Mr. Goldberg should take his own advise,"I read the book after watching Mr. Goldberg on television several times. I was looking forward to the book. Mr. Goldberg attacks mainstream media for not checking it facts while making obvious errors, for taking things out of context and for media taking sides in the issues of the day. He then fails to follow his own advise. On page 219 and 220 he allegedly quotes Ted Turner for calling the 911 hijackers brave. Obviously this was wrong and he puts words in Mr. Turner's mouth. Then he cites a speech of Febraury 11, 2000. Either Mr. Turner can see in the future or the refence is wrong as this speech would have occurred 19 months before the hijackers took over the planes.He then ends the book by saying the media elites should follow Ed Murrow for their guide. He then quotes Mr. Murrow taking sides on a great issue of the time.I thought the book drags on and he takes long to make his point. I agree with what he says he should just follow his own advise."
2,im not convinced on this product,"i purchased this from lowes because buying it from here they remove the cables and remote that come with it. then they sell it seperate. ALL units come with the cables and remote. Plus my unit turns its fan on when its turned off and NO load.Do not buy from here because its a ripoff, I took the 357.00 price in to lowes to match and mine came with everything. Also be prpared to have some serious batteries to run this-im looking at 10 rated at 210 minutes each.It is a power hog. and the digital meter never registers 13.4. I looked here and gopower makes a 3000. for about the same price. I was so looking forward to this working relaibly"
1,Listed as a Pure Sine Wave Inverter,"Amazon lists MOST Power Bright Inverters as TRUE sine wave inverters - they are NOT - they are modified sine wave inverters - not good for electronics, some small appliances or small tool battery chargers. Be aware and read as much about the inverter as you can find. I have to return the new Power Bright inverter I just purchased because of this mistake."
2,Not what I was expecting,"By looking at the coverart, I thought I would finally see a step by step process on how to draw bishies, but I was really disappointed-not only did they not show you how to draw bishes, but the characters they show you how to draw look nothing like the front cover."
4,A Window,Mr. Santos' lyrical and thoughtful storytelling provides welcome insight into the history and culture of south Texas. The book provided a window into parts of San Antonio about which I have been both ignorant and curious. This is a smart selection as the first read for the 1 Book 1 San Antonio program.
4,in the style of Victor Villasenor..........................,The tapestry of the Mexican family and the migration of many of its components north to the United States is wonderfully woven into this charming autobiography. The richness of these families is a treasure for sure.
2,disappointed,"A whole lot of rambling, no real story or substance. I kept waiting forsome resolution but he just keeps rambling on... making no sense.A waste of time."
2,Fascinating subject matter but poorly written and edited,"Santos' account of his family history is interesting, particularly the mystery surrounding his grandfather's depression and suicide. But the actual writing of this book is flawed and repetitive. The sentences drone on, clauses piling up without any seeming connection. And the author's compunction to end every section with a pithy meditative comment gets annoying quickly. Definitely wait for the paperback on this one."
3,Not What I was Looking For,"I was very disappointed with this book. What parent/child doesn't know about hitting balloons around? Playing Follow the Leader? Or putting babies on their stomachs to strengthen their bodies since they are supposed to be sleeping on their backs all the time. Or putting objects ahead of them to encourage moving toward the toy? It is filled with what I feel is common knowledge--health risks of inactivity, kids' organized sports pros & cons, ""motor milestones"" for infants. I was looking for some creative ideas for small children, especially ideas on keeping active during the winter and bad weather. I was expecting many suggestions on simple, inexpensive ideas for active play, ratings of active play equipment, suggestions for some toys good for active play (beyond hoola hoops, balls, etc.). I didn't gain one good new idea from reading the whole book. But, I was glad to see the much hated Dodge Ball is now banned in many schools!"
3,It's a textbook,"I needed it for a class - it's a textbook. Quite dull, but thorough. It was useful to help me write my paper."
3,funny movie,"I watched this movie only because I am a great fan of Brent Spiner.He plays a little role, but indeed his performance is great...The protagonist is really funny and I hope that there will be a sequel..."
3,"Not one of their best, but worth watching","True, it`s not one of their best efforts. It`s not in the same class as ""Airplane"" or ""An American Carol"", but it`s worth watching.It does a fairly good job of spoofing the superhero movies like Spiderman.It will never be a classic, but there are a lot worse stuff out there you could blow your hard earned cash on. It does have more than a few good laughs in it, but the Spiderman type movies are such an easy target for a spoof that I really expected better.The bits about Stephen Hawking were in bad taste. Picking on a guy confined to a wheelchair who cannot even talk without mechanical aid is more than a little over the top even if it isn`t intended to be malicious."
4,"Another Spoof, But A Good One","Yes, another spoof has been made, but this one ain't half bad. If you are a comic book fan, or at least a fan of the recent comic movies, then you will enjoy this movie. There are parts of the film that I was literally laughing out loud (which isn't good when you are watching the movie at 1am and everyone else is asleep in the house).The sad thing is, there are parts that weren't funny and kind of dull. I can't tell where, but it starts off pretty funny and then loses steam. However, unlike some movies, this one eventually picks up again. The part that I didn't care for was the X-Men reference. It wasn't even really needed. So yeah, I'd say that this is a movie to check out if you are a fan."
1,"Not funny, no wonder we never heard about it before!","This movie is trying to mock spiderman. Its trying hard to be funny, but it simply can't.Full of Repetitive jokes!Very Predictable!Quite Silly, and not the kind of funny silliness.Total failure to mock a great movie such as SpidermanIt thought it could be successful by mocking Spiderman the same way Scary Movie did with Scream, but there is no comparison what so ever between the two.I don't remember laughing or even smiling while watching the movie."
1,This sucks.,"What a waste of time. The Scary movie's were great, but this one just sucks. The first 10 mins are funny then the movie stinks except for a few comic reliefs but comedy master Leslie Neilson. Neilson is the only saving factor in this film, and even he, the lord of laughs cannot keep this stinker afloat. Waste of time, fast forward to the Leslie Neilson parts, other the that pass."
3,SO-SO,"I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WOULD BE SIDE-SPLITTING FUNNY, BUT IT DID NOT STAND UP TO MY EXPECTATIONS IN THE LEAST BIT."
3,blu ray goofiness,"This flick which is a average entry into the spoof genre, one that has direct roots to the classic movie ""Airplane"". In many ways they are all similiar from ""Scary movie"" to 'Hot shots"" they spoof a current trend or movie. In this one they mainly spoof 'spiderman""; but in spite of the extended gay and fart jokes it's still entertaining. The main villian 'hourglass"" is actually a good supervillian that could fit well into any comic book or film based on a comic books. In fact most movies are storyboarded just like a comic book before shooting. So anyone who looks down at comics should forget about movies as well. This isn't a stand out performer in it's genre but it's what you expect and that's some laughs and lots of silliness. Since 'airplane' there has been a alot of these over the top spoofs and they all have their moments and a basic similiar structure based on a outlandish gags. The blu ray print is as good as it gets and this is the only way to watch this movie if possible."
4,Decent Movie,"Superhero Movie is actually not too bad. It's all tongue and cheek of course, which is the main reason I like it. It mostly makes fun of the Spiderman movies but also the X-Men ones. I don't give it all the stars though since it's not a complex plot or anything different than other movies have done before."
3,Gets the movie parody thing right!,"There's a horrible trend nowadays of movies assuming that stringing together a clump of unrelated jabs at current events & ripping off scenes from all sorts of movies is parody. It's not. For ages it seemed that the art of satire & parody ala Naked Gun & Not Another Teen Movie was lost in a wave of stupid & incredibly unfunny movies such as Epic Movie. Then along came Super Hero Movie.The movie follows after a mild mannered schoolboy who gets bitten by a dragonfly and gains superpowers. The movie then chooses to focus on one movie (Spiderman) to parody & only briefly touches on the others, focusing mainly on parodies & sight gags.The movie may not be the greatest, but it's still funny enough to watch just to watch a stupid movie. Maybe if we're lucky the trend of writing parodies properly will stick & we'll see the end of stupid films such as Meet the Spartans."
1,this movie is uber lame!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,i hated this movie i saw it in theaters years ago when i was still working at my local movie theater this movie did not even make me lol this is one of the worst spoof movies ever made!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,I DIDN'T LIKE THIS DVD AT ALL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I WAS NOT HAPPY WITH THIS MOVIE AT ALL. IT WAS AS FUNNY AS THE COMMERCIALS MADE IT SEEM TO BE.
2,rent before you buy,"I watched this movie with some friends the other night. I found myself and a few of my friends actually falling asleep by the middle of the film. There were very few funny parts, this movie was a BIG waste of time. Lets pray they don't release a second."
3,one of the better spoofs,"out of some of the recent spoof films superhero movie is one of the better ones.it has many jokes that i found funny and i even lol sometimes when i watch it.trust me though if you want a good spoof buy scary movie 1,naked gun 1,airplane,or top secret.they are all good and this one is better than disaster movie and meet the spartans."
4,Those who like Airplane...,"For those who like the movie Airplane, you will probably like this movie. It is a slap stick comedy without it being too over the top. It is a good movie to put in if you just want a laugh and to put your brain on stand by."
1,ZERO stars was not an option,"As a lifelong Lutheran I repudiate this bookThis book is entirely negative in its treatment of homosexuality. The author, a Lutheran pastor, expressed as 'myths' the ideas that homosexuals are created that way, that they can be happy and well adjusted Christians, all as a way to explain why the church need not concern itself with these children of God. Glesne describes sexual practices with debasing and demeaning terms all of which is un-necessary to his book. He is obviously pandering to homophobic feelings. He quotes a single study that shows that homosexuals can be changed to heterosexuals through reparative therapy which is not recommended by American Psychiatric Association policy."
5,Tune it up and lay it down Vol 3,Bought this for my son and he LOVES it. He put it on his MP3 almost as soon as it was out of the package and has been laying it down since. Great concept for budding drummers!
2,camera,"the reason that I did not like it, as it did not fit my camera. It said it fit that model, but it did not. Had to return it."
5,Amazon,Great job!!! Received it very quickly. Thank you I am very please with the response time. I will order again.
5,Works great!!!,I've been using it for a few weeks now and it works better then the original that came with the camera.
5,"Great for Apple iBook 12""","I use this all the time, in my backpack and suitcase. It fits my iBook 12-inch like a glove, and I can carry extra cd's etc. It even has tabs that you can slip over the bottom of the laptop, so you can use the laptop with the case attached--almost like a book cover. I've used mine for over a year and the zipper still works great and it shows no wear. I carry the power adapter separately. Although it would fit inside, it just stretches the neoprene in a wierd way, like the bulging box on G W Bush's back during the 2004 debates. So I carry it separately. For the person who gave this one star because it did not fit his computer, that doesn't make any sense. If it doesn't fit, it's not the case's fault!I no longer use my big and bulky ""computer bag"". I love this case!"
3,Not for Toshiba Satellite U205,"The Toshiba website suggest this sleeve for their 12.1"" Satellite Laptop, but the sleeve is to small for this laptop."
2,A Bit Too Tight for comfort; Weak Zipper,"I've used this for less than a year. Zipper couldn't stand the strain of moderate usage and broke. I have a very small and thin laptop - a Toshiba Portege R200, which is the standard 12.1"" size for which this bag is made, but the fit is rather tight and I wonder if that contributed to the strain on the zipper. Another worry I always had was whether the zipper would dig into the sides of the laptop when it was fully zippered shut."
3,nice but fragile,"It works great for my thinkpad x60, and even stretched to cover the two extended batteries I put on it. The zipper pulls kept coming off, even with gentle use. If you want a tight fit for a good price it's OK though. I'm buying another one."
2,Jewel Case in pieces!,"It arrived in a million pieces. So far, I have not found any damage to the CD, itself, but who knows?"
5,"His best, in my book","This is my all-time favorite John Prine album, and I'm a long-time fan. How can you top a line like ""You've broken the speed of the sound of loneliness""? The backups are just right for these songs, too. Listen through headphones to get all the subtleties. Like another reviewer, at first I prefered other takes on Paradise, but now I think I like this one at least as well."
3,German Afternoons,"This is a great CD with many good cuts but does not measure up to the soulful melancholy that I find so soothing in his ""Fair and Square"" album. It has some funny tunes tho."
3,Cute toy for an Eeyore fan,"I bought this for a friend who loves everything Pooh/Eeyore, so when I saw this product on-line I thought it would make a cute gift for her baby shower. Now I wish I would have been able to see the actual product in person before making my purchase.The toy is nice when it comes to the size, shape and colors (and may make a cute office cubicle/bedroom toy for an Eeyore fan), but buyer beware: If you are getting this because ""A different note is played as you push each leg!"" and ""Baby will have lots of fun making merry music with Eeyore Tunes"", you may want to know that the ""note"" and ""merry music"" that are played when you push each foot sound more like a weak/deflated/broken kids bike horn that can barely make a honking noise."
4,A rarity...,"As good as this CD is it still a few flaws. Just focusing on pop and dance/club mixes, a lot of the songs still give that ""ganas"" to dance. It's a shame she couldn't broaden her horizons into maybe salsa or merengue or an all pop CD and stay with this one and only release. Maybe her hubbie Marc Anthony can help a little."
5,One page is worth the price of the book,"Page 963 alone is worth the price of the book if you are an advanced user. I learned how to set up all my blocks into a custom tool palette. Tool palettes are a new feature in 2004.I started at chapter one, and learned about features I have overlooked although I've been using AutoCAD since version 10.I can't praise Mr Omura enough, he even gives his e:mail address and invites suggestions for improvements. There isn't a better book on the market for new users of AutoCAD, or experienced users either. The writing style and exercises are so easy to follow."
1,Not Useful,The book is not very useful. This book is too voluminous for an autocad textbook. The author should publish a more concise version.
2,"I love Neruda, but...","Appears I am the contra voice on this one. Perhaps all the little poems mean something to the author, but most were either too obscure, silly or meaningless to me.. As it was at the end of his life/career, this is not what made Neruda famous, though it is clear it has a broad and deep appreciation in it's own right. Just didn't click for me, but i would absolutely encourage anyone to check it out for themselves."
4,Beautiful,I love his poetry. The translation is not as good as I expected but it's OK. The drawings are beautiful.
4,Lovely,"Having only read one of the Odes...I was compelled to give my feedback. Poetry and Neruda's greatness aside, this book is beautiful. Beautifully bound and lovely illustrations. I'm thrilled I'm giving this as a gift!"
3,A little disappointed for a newborn,"I bought this mattress pad without realizing that this goes over and on top of your crib sheet. It was difficult to tell in pictures and you couldn't open it in the store. I have a 3 month old now and it is too rough on her facial skin, where she wakes up with the imprint of the quilt pattern on her face. I took it off and bought another so her face can rest on a crib sheet that is softer, not the mattress pad - otherwise why do you need a crib sheet? I will save it for a later time when she produces more fluids that come out of her body, but for now I think it is overkill since we have never needed to use its waterproofing system."
2,Good to have but not necessary,"Got this for my then newborn and thought it was a life saver until she started soiling it months later and then realized it isn't all that easy to get on and off. With 8 snap on straps, it's a hassle to move the crib away from the wall and snap on/off on a regular basis. I realized changing the crib sheet was just easier. With crib mattresses being vinyl covered, why do we need waterproof sheets anyway. I just slip off her fitted sheet and wipe up any wetness off the vinyl - so simple. Sometimes good marketing convinces us that we need useless products. By the way, two of the straps broke off in the wash, thank God it was after I realized I didn't need this anyway."
5,the best mattress pad!!!,"I have a seven month old that has spit up and drooled since he was born. This mattress pad is the best at keeping the moisture off of him. I would recommend buying two, so you always have one on the bed when washing the other."
1,RETURNED PAD - LEFT MESH IMPRINT ON FACE,"The ""Breathe Safe Padded Sheet"" also left a mesh imprint on my baby's face. Placing a sheet over the Breathe safe pad defeats the purpose of lessening the current routine:1) Untying bumper guard & moving it out of the way2) Struggling to ""pull"" out heavy mattress from crib3) Removing & washing sheet & mattress pad4) Wiping off mattress with soap & water5) Replacing sheet & mattress pad6) Returning heavy mattress to crib7) Re-arranging dust ruffle8) Re-tying bumper guardOther than that, it seemed like a good idea. Searching for a better product."
3,Strange black spots?,"We originally purchased this item for our son 3 years ago but by the time our daughter was born 7 months ago the pad had developed several strange black spots. We weren't sure if it was some sort of mildew or mold or what, so we played it safe and purchased a new one for her. However, after the first time I washed the new pad and hung it to air dry, I noticed two of the black spots on IT! A mysterious red patch has since appeared. We have NO idea what these spots are. Otherwise we really like the pad and it gives us peace of mind, but I'm still wondering what causes the discoloration???"
5,Wonderful For Novice and Experienced Rat Fanciers!,"I have read the book The Proper Care Of Fancy Rats (t.f.h.) - repeatedly - and have found the information to be invaluable. It covers basic care, illnesses, varieties and standards, breeding and some of the basics of rat genetics. It also includes a lot of beautiful full color photos. I've read a few other books on rodent care, none of which were as detailed as this (those books all ended up in a used book store). I would HIGHLY suggest that every rat owner purchase this book and keep it handy. Its easy to follow and covers all the bases!"
3,One of the few rat books out there...,"This book has some good info, but most of it is seriously outdated. Don't take anything in here as law until you research it a little more elsewhere! It arrived quickly and in good condition, with only a few headers highlighted."
2,"Cute, but Poorly Constructed","I have a very gentle playing cockapoo and he LOVES plushy footballs. This particular football, while very cute and soft, had a hole in it the same day that I gave it to him. I took it away and up to my sewing room, and after taking it apart a little found that the construction is VERY poor. Mesh fabric lines the white material which my dog's little teeth punctured and ripped immediately. I tried to reinforce the stiching with some thread, but a week later it was sporting holes again so I threw it out. Very disappointing."
1,Disappointment,"Got this for our JRT bc football toys are hard to fine, it did not even last 1 day before it ripped at all the seams. This is not made well at all. I know that I posted I got this for our JRT and JRT's are known to be crazy-energy dogs however; our dog is very lazy and not the typical JRT and he still managed to destroy this after one play time. The search for a new football toy continues..."
4,As advertised,"It's small, but definitely measures true to advertised size. The squeaker is pretty weak, though. I bought this toy as a prop for my Rottweiler's Halloween costume. I don't expect it to last long once I give it to her."
5,Great Stuff,"After eating this stuff, my Chinchillas will NOT EAT ANYTHING ELSE. This stuff is insanely expensive at Petsmart. I bought several bags on here for a good price (mine came out to about 4$ a back, compared to 15$ at petsmart). Highly recommended, mine loved it."
2,Unimpressed,"I ordered this book thinking it would be the one for my class, and it turns out that it is from 1987. The title is called ""News Writing and Reporting for Today's Media""! They didn't even have internet back then!!! Not impressed"
5,Martha's Masterpiece,"Richard Perry worked with Martha Reeves seemingly forever on this album--the word was out on it in the press more than a year before it actually appeared. Everyone expected it to shoot to number one but MCA a) gave it a weak cover b) which was imitated almost exactly by Motown's Martha Reeves and the Anthology released simultaneously in terms of color scheme and border c) picked the wrong song for a single; it should have been the incredible ""Wild Night."" The album did a crash landing but that doesn't take away from the truth that artistically it is invincible, a remarkable achievement and still thrilling to hear. Recovered, retitled (that is, GIVEN a title) and rereleased it could STILL be a hit."
2,PROBLEMS,"I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT FROM CIRCUIT CITY TWO MONTHS AGO AND HAVE HAD NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS FROM THE START. FIRST THE DVD WRITER DRIVE SAID THAT WHEN I PUT A BLANK CD IN TO COPY IT SAYS THERE IS NO CD IN THAT DRIVE, CALLED HP AND FIXED THE PROBLEM FOR A WHILE.THEN MY MOUSE AND VIDEOS WOULD FREEZE AT CERTAIN POINTS, HAD TO TAKE IT TO GET FIXED AT CIRCUIT CITY. NOW JUST LAST WEEK A BLUE SCREEN CAME UP WHEN I BOOTED UP AND SAID WINDOWS WAS SHUT DOWN TO PREVENT DAMAGE TO YOU COMPUTER AND IT HAD JUST DUMPED MEMORY, AND THAT A SOFTWARE OR OTHER PROBLEM COULD RUIN THE COMPUTER...ALSO WHEN I LOADED MY CD IN THE E DRIVE IT SAID IT WAS IN THE F DRIVE BEFORE THIS HAPPEN. I WILL NEVER BUY A HP COMPUTER AGAIN BASED ON THESE PROBLEMS...I ADDED 1 GIG OF MEMEORY AND A GEFORCE 6600 VIDEO CARD FOR WHAT????"
4,An excellent fusion of themes,"The Book of Lost Innocence is a skilled blend of religious allegory with a backdrop of a fantasy drama. Short and to the point, the tale quickly launches into symbolic themes of mortal fallibility, redemption, and the impossibility of perfection amidst a modern story of angels walking among mortals, struggling to find their own places in an imperfect heaven and earth. The ending is sudden and shocking, revealing that even the greatest of creatures can possess crippling flaws while the worst of creatures may still possess redeeming virtues, ultimately leaving the reader pondering his or her own moral compass in our own imperfect world."
4,The Military Band - A Salute to the Services,"I bought this record because my dad was one of the musicians who played on the record. He received one back in the late 1950's as gratis from the conductor, Felix Slatkin of whom he was good friends.My brother and I played the #@!$ out of this record. We pretended like we were in the army marching around my parents living room. More of a nostalgia piece than anything. However, if you like military style of music, you may give it a listen."
1,songs too WEAK,"the rappists here need to find some better rhythms and lyrics.....they need to follow the example of jay-z, ja rule, snoop, ect."
1,THIS GUYS SUCKSSSS NO TALENT AT ALL.,THEY NEED TO LEARN HOW TO RAP OR HOW TO THINK BEFORE THEY WRITE ALL THE BEATS SUCKS TOO. I BET THEY GOT A DEAL CUS THEY NEW SOMEBODY NOT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TALENT. JUST SUCSSSSSSSSSS
1,"worthless, agreed",The pedal fell off right away for me too. This is one type of purchase you'll want to spend a little more money on. I wish I had :(
4,Great Book,"This is a great book. I have recommended it to many friends who are seeking a change to their current professions. It picks up where ""What Color is Your Parachute?"" leaves off. Highly recommended read."
2,Don't get it if you run XP,"Initially a great gadget for the transfer of you digital photos. However, I recently upgraded my operating system; going from WIN2000 to the ultimate in Multi-media XP! I really expected that the ZIO was compatable with XP, as the drivers for XP are loaded onto the installation CD. However, the installation driver on the CD are not compatible with XP???"
3,this is not a flash card reader,"I purchased what I thought was a flash card reader only to discover that this product only reads ""smart media"" cards... be sure you are ordering what you want. I am presently attempting to contact Beach Audio to get the reader exchanged for one I can actually use. I will let you know the outcome of that."
3,Return item because it did not fit,I have returned this item but have not heard from you. Have you received this item back? Sabrina
4,Nice set,"I ordered this to store my china in our attic, so that my granddaughter could have it when she grows up. I wanted something to protect them from breakage. This was a nice quilted set with foam to put between the pieces. It held all my china and then I placed it all in a large storage tub with a lid. It was perfect. Now I don't have to worry about chips or cracks. I think this set was a great value for the quality. I admit the foam pieces for in between were thin, as others have reported, but they are enough to keep the pieces from sliding around or bumping."
1,This Cast Should Be Whacked!!,"I don't know about who wrote most of these earlier reviews, but my God, this is the absolute worst movie ever portraying these God-like men of Cosa Nostra. Christain Slater? Are you kidding me? And what is with this crap regarding the British speaking Maranzano? This is by far the most foul portrayal of La Cosa Nostra ever put on film. Do yourself a favor, if you haven't seen it, don't. And if you have, and like it, kill yourself, because I can't go through life knowing I'm competing for the same air as someone who is completely the poster child for people who shouldn't breed."
4,"Great Movie, but inaccurate history lesson","This movie has some very great aspects to it. If you just enjoy a fast moving, quick thinking film, than this is for you. If you are a mafia history buff, than it is not. Basically this movie focuses on Lucky Luciano, and his three friends. Luciano is portrayed as almost a martyr in it, when in real life he was a common thug. The movie is very entertaining, but if you know anything about Luciano, and his associates, than you'll realize that there are tons of historical inaccuracies."
3,Chance it,"Well its not a classic, but it doesn't deserve a 1 star either. I have the VHS version which in my opinion was better than DVD.If you know the history of Lucky Luciano, you probably will find flaws with this movie. If you don't know the history of Lucky, there's a good chance you might like it.This totally could have been a better film if it was put in better hands (Not to take anything away from the filmmakers). But if you have actors like Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci etc. attached to a film it sure helps, especially for that era (90's) not to mention the script."
1,disapointed,"Couldn't play this video because it required downloading an update to my DVD player. this was not stated on the ad, but was on a note inside of the DVD case. Will never by from this vendor again."
4,Great Movie!!!,Sure it's about four attractive guys...but it's also about how a friendship can prevail when money and power come into play.
3,About as realistic as the man in the moon,"Lucky,Lansky,and the rest of the THUGS portrayed here as if they were choirboys with machine-guns were murderous killers,drooling animals that should have been put down as rabid dogs are the moment thier disease manifested itself...Instead,in this film,we are subjected almost to a disney-like version of events,and ,as portrayed by this quartet of 1990s pretty-boys,as if crime,murder,prostitution,loan-sharking and all of the other nefarious activities these animals were into was just prankish play by a bunch of twenty-something lads..what rubbish...Not only that,but they take reality and trash it in favor of fiction...The events portrayed for the most part either didn't happen or happened in an entirely different way than as portrayed here.."
1,I WAS SENT WRONG PRODUCT.... VERY DISATISFIED,I ordered this DVD and was sent the HD-Version which will NOT play on my DVD Player..I now see that the order indicates HD but the HD was not clear when ordering...
1,Horrible.....,Almost everything in this movie is a lie.... Although somethings in the movie happened almost all of it didn't happen the way the movie potrays.. This movie should be outlawed for its unrealistic potral of some of the most respected gangsters in American history...
2,Not worth buying,"Christian Slater does not fit the role of Lucky Luciano or any kind of Italian mobster. It could have used real looking gangsters instead of Hollywood prettyboys.The story is too exaggerated for a gangster film. I hate the part where the little boy walks into the bar to ask Christian Slater for a job,just because the way he looks. No one becomes a gang leader just because of the way they look. I'd much rather watch The Godfather or Goodfellas. It could have been better"
2,mobsters with c. slater,"Was not happy with this cut of this movie! Alot of good scenes were cut out of this movie ""WAY"" not as good as it really is. Wish i'd have known. wouldn't have purchased it!!!:("
4,Good mobster movie...,"I thought mobsters was a good mafia movie, though it had Christian Slater star as 'Lucky' Luciano. Could have been better, but another great mafia movie. I would recommend buying it, cause it's a classic."
5,Works great. Price can't be beat.,"Works great. Price can't be beat. Case seems sturdy, and the data transfer rate seems very fast."
5,Great Strategies for Middle School,Robb does a great job of taking balanced reading strategies that work great at lower levels and adapting them to middle school reading. This book would be very helpful for anyone wanting new reading ideas. The title is a bit misleading--I can see upper elementary teachers as well as high school teachers finding something useful!
4,"Its a good book, but...","I have two books--one for each of my sons. The book is adorable without being too feminine. The subject ideas are also great--they remind you to document things you might otherwise not think of. The pages are beautiful and easy to write on.However, I have two complaints. The pages in one of the books came out of the binding--they are loose and fall out every time I pick up the book. It supposedly comes with a lifetime guarantee and I am going to test it out and try to get my book replaced. The other problem is there are too many ""firsts"" in the book. For example, the first time you drew a picture, the first time you held your bottle, the first song you sang, etc. I find that most of these events occurred gradually and incompletely. I ended up leaving lots of blanks in the book because there was no definitive ""first time"" for many indicated events."
5,One of the best plays ever written,"There is nothing like a play that delves deep into the universal human need to find purpose and does it in such an entertaining and insightful way. The play is not preachy, but it shows how patterns of thought can either bury you alive or lift you up. How does a teenager who is emotionally abused at home find meaning and purpose in her life? Read the play and find out. You will not be disappointed."
1,Book falling apart!,"When I saw this said it was a 'collectable' at that price, I was quitepleased! BUT...when I got the book, the page would fall off the spine as you turned the page to read. It was NOT in collectable condition at all, not at all.I wish these Sellers could be a little more accurate when describing items.We as Buyers have to rely on what we're told...pay for it ahead of time...then cross our fingers that we were told the truth about our purchases.I threw the book away after reading it...it was worthless for anyone else to even barely be able to read it. I swear I'll try to be more aware next time..."
3,Good quick read,"I thought this play was an entertaining quick read. It was certainly different. I'll admit I bought the book because of the title and cover art. This play wasn't life changing or a play I'll treasure for ever but since it IS, as I've said, a quick read and entertaining: it's worth giving it a try! Most importantly, it isn't your run of the mill play about a family. It certainly is unique."
5,Titus rocks!,Titus is a highly underrated performer. his television show should have NEVER been cancelled! in this comedy special he has a way of talking about real and seious issues and making you laugh about them. he does it without undermining the issues.
5,"The continuing story of a funny man,Titus.","If you were a fan of the TV show Titus,as I was,your going to love this too.The show should have lasted at least 3 more seasons.This goes over some of what was on the show as well as more or less bringing you up to date with what's going on in the world now and of course his halarious view of it."
4,Titus fans will appreciate this.,"I ordered this because I had borrowed a relative's copy and had to have my own copy. If you enjoyed the TV series as much as my husband and I did, this is a CD to consider owning. It is not devoid of profanity but, as an adult, I am not really offended and not exposing any tender young ears to it. It is funny, timely, and so very insightful in exposing the ""disfunctional' side of all our families in some form or another.I wish everything Christopher has done were available on CD or DVD. I really enjoy his work."
4,Practical and detailed English phonetics text,"After looking at a number of textbooks for a course in English phonetics, I decided to use Fundamentals of Phonetics by Larry Small. The book almost teaches itself. There are hundreds of short exercises that students can use on their own. The answer key at the back of the book covers a vast majority of the learning tools. My task as a teacher is greatly simplified.The examples and diagrams are clear. I also like the enclosed CD with sample utterances. I would have preferred that the audio tapes mentioned in the text be included on the CD, rather than as a separate purchase."
2,Phonetics Book,"It is a good book and i reccieved it in a timely manner, i was just alittle disappointed that it was missing a few pages :("
2,Didnt come with Cd,Throughout this book they kept referring to the cd that was suppose to come with it. I needed this book for a class I was talking but it didn't help me one bit and so I had to drop the class and this stupid book.
4,Filter for Camcorder,Bought these filters for my husbands new Camcorder. He has found them useful in the bright sun.
3,Be Warned,"This book is a retitled ""No Nudes is Good Nudes"" which is not pointed out by Amazon.com. I now have two copies of the same book and am not real pleased about that. The book itself is typical good Wodehouse stuff but the 3 stars is mean for Amazon.com."
4,An Entertaining Romp,"Typical of the Castle Blandings series, Wodehouse serves up a dose of wacky mahem. The story this time centers around a painting purchased by the Duke of Dusntable and a troubled romance. In the beginning, Lord Emsworth is troubled by the news that his sister Connie, a dragon of a woman, is returning to Castle Blandings for a visit. The troubled Lord Emsworth calls on his brother Gallahad Threepwood, a member of the Pelican club and the Pelican mentioned in the title, to provide him moral support in the face of his sister. Before going to the castle, Gallahad finds out that his godson is engaged to the neice of the Duke of Dunstable, which his sister Connie has invited to the castle. However, the engagement goes bad, and Gallahad must think of a way to get his godson into the castle to mend the relationship. Pure Wodehouse.This story is a good read, but not the best of the series. However, if you're a Wodehouse fan, you probably should pick this up."
4,A Must for PB enthusiasts,"It had to be See For Miles, United Kingdom to assemble this scarce collection. The renderings on a few tracks could have been better. However, for those who really like the songs of Pat Boone, this is a collection worth possessing. The tracks carefully selected are difficult to obtain even on vinyl discs. I have some old 45 rpms, but they have been played too many times to give a true reproduction. Hence, this CD is very welcome."
3,Homenaje a alvaro carrillo serie de oro,"Songs are nice made by the maestro Carrillo. one singer very boring style. more interpretes would it make it a great Homenaje CD,"
5,My review of House of Blues,Love it and will definitely try this again. A big thanks to my friend in Florida who made me aware of this service.
4,I would read it again,"Ive read 8 books in the last year about ted williams and I found that this book doesnt talk as much about his life but more of his statistics throughout his years in the PCL , AA , HS , and MLB. It is amazing that they were able to find the statistics they did for his highschool days and the few tournaments he played in. But if you are going for a more complete book about his life I would go with Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero by Leigh Montville."
5,Joy-The Ventures Latin Album,"This is a must CD to buy in spite of the cost. At first I only expected a few songs I would like since I heard them before, however, once I heard the whole album, it turns out I love every single song in this album. The Ventures's style of relating their music is unique, no other instrumental group can be close to what the Ventures can deliver. The versions of One Fine Day, Swan Lake, Elise are music to my ears, classics delivered with such beautiful style and taste."
5,Hot Rox Warning!,"Great product and it delivers!However, ensure you REALLY hydrate well, and ABSOLUTELY abstain from caffeine while taking. If heart rate and blood pressure go through the ceiling, check with a physician. Adhere to the instructions on the bottle and if possible . . . attempt to incorporate anaerobic exercise at least 5 times per week (running or biking)."
3,"Legit, but really nothing special.","Took this before I decided to help me cut down back when I began my fitness journey. Is it a legit thermogenic? The answer is yes but really any one of VPX's Redline lineup is superior IMO. In my experience most thermo's only have appetite suppressing effects in the first 4 weeks or so of cycling. The real beauty of them is for HIT or extended cardio to burn those calories. Wasn't disappointed but not something I would buy again. Helpful if you are truly out of shape but if you are cutting- honestly... don't beat around the bush, just take VPX Clenbutrx, that stuff is the truth. I don't recall getting that 'oh it's hot in here' body warm feeling from most thermo's but I can say that it does give a weird berry sort of aftertaste whenever you burp/etc., I wouldn't say it was unpleasant but it's something to consider."
1,Pinky Ball Book and Pinky Ball,"I have the Pinky Ball Book but after 2 orders I did not receive the Pinky Ball with the Book. I am very dissatisfied with how Amazon treated the entire order. After receiving the first book that was sent to me as a gift, Amazon issued me a credit and I reordered the Pinky Ball Book and Pinky Ball again. I once again received the Pinky Ball Book and it came again without the Pinky Ball. After spending much time on the phone Amazon wanted me to send the Book back and issue me another credit. I do not want the credit I want the Pinky Ball that goes with the book that was advertised on line.Sincerely,Michael B. Kabat"
2,Would be great if most wasn't inaudible!,I bought this audio CD and at first it seemed to be just what I was looking for. Unfortunately it was recorded during a live classroom setting and the instructor did not repeat the audience questions so the listener would know the gist of his responses. About 1/3 of the CD is just blank.
1,"Ooof, a tough listen and somewhat empty","The title of the CD is User Stories, and an audience member asks him to explain what a User Story is, yet he still doesn't even explain it. U(Unless he lulled me to sleep and I missed it?) Tons of math computing how great XP is and all, but no methodology. No tangible information. Speaker constantly refers to slide you can't see, and spouts ancillary details but really never establishes a foundation or mental framework to build upon. You find yourself waiting for it to ""really"" start for the whole 68 minuutes. I actually made a special trip out of my way to write this negative review which I've never done before. I cannot recommend this CD."
1,Slot TOO small,OK. Believe it or not. I purchased this item for my multimedia card and had to return it because the card DID NOT fit into the slot!
5,This book warms your heart!,"I don't need a thousand words to review this book All I know is that this book, The Prince of Whales has captured my imagination and my love for the creatures who cannot really talk for themselves. Long live Toby!!"
2,I cant get it yet,"Im a little bit worrie about my subscripcion of this magazine because i cant get it yet... when i supost to have it already!!!.Please let me know about it. and when i can get it, PLEASE"
3,A Distraction,"With the exception of part two, this is a wonderful medieval mystery. Part two takes us into the ""Forest People"", today's witches, which would not be so bad except that the author belabors the plot here, reminding me of the classic comedy routine from Abbot and Costello ""slowly he turned, step-by-step, inch by inch"": step by step and inch by inch we follow one of the Forest People through the darkness, groping, feeling, supposedly creating suspense, but just testing the reader's patience. I was forced to speed through the section. I hate doing that, but I sensed that nothing really would be gained - 49 pages could have been cut to fifteen!! to establish the information needed at the end.Sorry, but I do not enjoy being dragged by any writer through obvious and unnecessary ""suspense material"" that is not suspenseful."
1,Bad Choice-Sorry !!!,Pretty lousy film - just a hodge-podge of everything you have seen before ! Certainly not worth the ten bucks plus spent on it and I could not wait for it to end.....
4,Very Cute,I bought this toy box at Toys R Us for $30 and it is too cute! I got it for my 19 month old and it is just the right size for her toddler toys. The mechanizim that keeps it from slamming shut works great you actually have to push the lid down to shut it. My daughter is a huge Pooh fan and she just loves it. It is the perfect addition to a Pooh themed room. I was afraid after seeing it online that it would be thin stickers on inexpensive fiberboard but it is actually thick material and the pictures are not just cheap stickers they are well attached.
5,How To Eat Fried Worms,"How to eat fried worms was a great book.A kid named Joe bet a new kid at his school to eat 10 worms.The boy that Joe bet the kid to eat 10 worms, his nane was Billy.Billy had a little brother named Woody.woody was in preschool.Billy hated Woody because Woody becaues Woody got more attention than Bill did.The main characters in the story was Billy,Joe,Benjey,and Woody.Billy was the one who ate the worms.Joe was the one who bet Billy too eat the worms.Benjey was the one who cooked the worms vary vary nastey.Woody was Billys little brother who always botherd Billy all the time.I really liked this book,and i hopr you will to."
5,Juan's Wormy Review,"What really got me in the book is how gross and funny the author wrote the book. I also liked that the book has 8 pages in fullcolor.And how Billy eats the worms with a whole bunch of seasonings.I thought it was smart to bury the worm in ketchup so he won't taste the blood and guts of the worm.The part I didn't like is when Alan tries to cheat, by MAKING a worm out of beans so that meant Billy ate 14 in 15 days insteadof 15 worms in 15 days."
4,George T. Cromwell 5th Grade Book Club Girls,"We liked the book because it was funny how Billy was dared toeat 15 worms . We still can't beleive he ate all the slimy but, fried worms!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!We didn't like how Alan tried to glue two worms together so Alan would get $50.00 .Also we thought it was sort of disgusting because he ate all of them . Last the print was to small ."
