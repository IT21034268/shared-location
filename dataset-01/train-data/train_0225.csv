4,EXCELLENT DANCEHALL REGGAE,"Ragga Ragga Ragga 16 is a great compilation of some of Jamaica's hottest dancehall artists. The CD opens with the incredible ""On Line"" by Elephant Man. Capleton has two mega hits, ""Them Running Out"" and the fast ""Lock Up."" Bounty Killer is angry as always with ""Look Good."" TOK's dance hit, ""Falla We"" is fast and furious. Lexxus comes out with two hits . Although not much of a fan of Harry Toddler, Beenie Man, or Sizzla, I must admit that they have some pretty good beats on this one. A must for any fan of dance and reggae music. Better than number 15."
1,Painful Reading,"I found the book to be extremely hard to get through, wordy and boring. The entire book focuses on direct quotations from all of Shakespeare's works with little focus as to why the quotations were included in the text. The book gives the reader little of his personal life, personality, or political views, but focuses only on hundreds of people that he knew and met throughout the years giving detailed explanations of names, and their backgrounds. I found the book to be very boring, with little content on Shakespeare as a person; the book featured only comments on his hundreds of works. If you are EXTREMELY well versed with Shakespeare's works, this is a good pick for you. If you have some to little knowledge, pick something else. For the student who needs interesting information on him as a person, choose another book. I found it to be dry, repetative and only in depth on quotations from thousands of plays."
5,mar is so beautiful,i first heard mar 2 or 3 years ago and fell in love. as a person who doesnt buy cds i can say that ive bought this album 2 separate times. the first one i lost and i just downloaded it from itunes. silence is such a beautiful album and im not sure why mar isnt bigger. buying this cd is a must. listen to the liar and you wont be able to stop.
3,Nice pendant.....,This pendant was a very nice piece and the pendant itself had a lot of weight to it for sterling silver. Loved the extension chain very much as it was a nice little added feature but thought the pendant was much larger than I expected it to be. I had wanted something to wear as casual but it is something to wear on special occasions. No dimensions or size of the pendant were mentioned in the description so it was hard to tell. I will keep it though because it is a very nice pendant.
5,The Juror dvd,I sent this to my sister who recently moved to the north woods and can't get many tv channels. It's a good dvd if you like suspense.
1,Silly and Predictable,"This is one of the worst movies I've seen in awhile. All it is about is Alec Baldwin being on trial, Demi Moore is one of the jurors, and Alec just keeps intimidating her to first get a hung jury, then to convince the rest of the jury that he's innocent (which he isn't, of course).There are absolutely NO twists and turns in this one. You can watch the first 45 minutes of it and pretty much guess how it's going to turn out.To it's credit, the acting is pretty good in this movie. It's almost funny how well Alec Balwdin plays a really mean person.But the actors could not save the movie from its ridiculous story. You'll want to skip this one."
1,Pointless and awful.,"The Juror starring Demi Moore and Alec Baldwin looked like such an entertaining thriller but this movie is just so stupid. I couldn't believe how dumb the plot and ending was. And who the hell what's to see Anne Heche naked? not me! One of the worst movies I have ever seen, use this one as a coaster."
2,One & only reason to see this movie--Alec Baldwin,"Plot is kind of ridiculous, but acting is good--especially Alec Baldwin's performance."
2,Book is too short,"This book is too short; the author clearly know what he's talking about, but he gives barely enough information for the book to be of any use."
1,I did not recieve the book,The Book was not delivered to Me and I had to wait for almost 1 month expecting it to come but without any use.But I am happy with the Amazon.com because they refunded the amount immediately when I complained about this.
5,Great way to learn what you cherish about your faith!,"What a great little book. It's packed with valuable information for anyone wishing to understand how our lives intertwine with God's word. The author really knows his stuff. I especially liked chapter 4, page 76 ""Imperial Selfs as a Standard."" The retelling of a Calvin and Hobbs classic reminded me of my old thinking before the Bible. And after reading page 79, I thank God for sending Grandma Ida Mae. Thanks for the lessons!"
4,Stinky,"But does the job without sticky residue and crunchy hair. Does help keep fine, thin and limp hair it's shape and volume."
3,Ghoulies can't be better.,"This is problary as good as a ghoulie movie can be. Better Ghoulie efects,and the story is ok..but if you gonna see this one,you nearly have to se the other three and..thats not wourth it!"
2,"About As Good As A Movie Called ""Ghoulies IV"" Could Be","Let me begin by stating that Ghoulies IV is a bad movie. Still, it has some goofy and hilarious moments sprinkled throughout that make it okay viewing for the b-movie fan. What disappointed me was that the original Ghoulies were nowhere to be found in Ghoulies IV, other than in flashbacks. Here we have new Ghoulies, and they are actually good guys. And they talk. Also, I wouldn't consider Ghoulies IV a horror movie or even a horror-comedy like the others in the series. It's a cop action-comedy with some supernatural elements. I swear, it's as if director Jim Wynorski hadn't seen any of the other entries in the Ghoulies series, because this one isn't like any of the others at all. And speaking of Wynorski, there isn't any nudity in Ghoulies IV. That must have been a first for him. After seeing Ghoulies IV, I can understand why this was the last in the series. The others were so bad they were good. This one's so bad, it's...just okay."
2,Where are the ghoulies?,"This is NOT a ghoulies film. There are NO old ghoulies, just new ghoulies. And those ghoulies have NOTHING to do with the story. This could have been an 1 hour movie without the ghoulies. But still, good story."
4,They'll get you in the end once again!,"Ghoulies 4 is pretty ghoulish. The ghoulies look very different from the last ghoulies, but there still cool. Theres some nice flash backs, from Ghoulies the first movie. Any fan of the ghoulies movies will enjoy watching Ghoulies 4."
2,NOT THE BEST!,"This movie is not so bad but there is one hug problem.Where are the old Ghoulies from 1,2,and 3?These new ghoulies are plain stupid.If you are a huge fan of the Ghoulies series buy it but if you not a big fan rent it first.I think that the price is not worth it."
2,2much2fast,"I'm sure this author knows what she means and means well but as an instructor she just doesn't get it.By page 25 she has thrown more stuff at u than many books cover. She forgot that the title said 'Beginning'.If u really r a beginner don't go here. Get the older VBA2000 and make the adjustments. I have both and I am telling u, i reach for the older one EVERY time."
1,Waste of time,I have started reading this book full of enthusiasm and ready to absorb all the information. To my disappointment I have found out that the writer keeps repeating the same things again and again without actually giving any usefull information. The examples are asking you to repeat the same typing again and again to find out that at the end they don't work. A total waste of time and money.
3,"This would be great, but....","I'd love this - it's cute, and has everything we needed - and then i got it home and realized that there isn't a line-out, just a line-in for an ipod. So this will NOT work with extra speakers etc.We won't be keeping ours, what good is a record player if you can't hook up additional speakers to it?"
4,Not for the audiophile but not a bad product.,"I thought my mom might like the item and I was pleasantly suprised. She was estatic about this all-in-one stereo. She like the features and the sound. She's used to hearing music on a smaller radio and wanted to play her old records and listen to cdrs which don't play on some boom boxes.Pro: Looks good, cd and radio sound pretty good, plays cdrs great.Cons: Tape and phonograph sound a little tinny, hard to read control panel, no output jacks (that I saw).My mother loved it and in the end, that all that really matters."
1,How hard is it?,"Want: Toaster that looks nice on my counter.Need: A toaster that worksI have what I want and not what I need! This toaster is one of those that when you toast something once (or maybe it's the first time you use it that day) you can't (but sometimes you can) put another piece of bread in and then push the handle down and have it ""WORK"" It seems to need to cool down? I'm not sure. I press the cancel button and unplug the toaster and then plug it back in until it decides it's ready to toast another piece of bread, a waffle or whatever I have in there. Don't waste your money. It's a piece of junk and unless you feel like standing there saying ""please god, have it work this time"" don't buy it. I have better things to do....especially when I have 2 little boys who are saying ""I want more!"" and I'm standing there saying ""I'm working on it!"" I seriously am standing there thinking Am I doing something wrong? Then I think...c'mon it's a toaster! How hard is this?"
5,Great for any train loving tike!,"The Road and Rail Zip bin made me as happy as it did my two boys. When zipped up into a bin it can hold an amazing amount of trains and track, literally an entire floor full!!! It was the perfect solution to my little train lovers clutter. What really makes it a spectacular deal is that the detail on the play mat is better than most train play mats I've seen, but for a better price you also get fantastic storage. It is good for both cars and trains."
3,Its ok,"My son loves cars. This came and was perfect. Exactly as described but my son got board with it. The idea is good, but trying to use it as described is almost impossible."
3,Fun Machines,My nephew got this for Christmas and when he unwrapped thebox his face lit up. Apparantly he knew that he could combinethe parts that form to creat this truck with another MEGA Righe has. He was so excited to create the biggest ever.. Of coursethe whole family had fun making different machines and listeningto him tell us how they'd work.
4,Another solid space opera,Another solid space opera patterned after the time period preceding WWII. The action sequencesare well done and the characters are real and sympathetic.Someone mentioned that this series declines as it goes on. This is book #4 and I rather enjoyedit. Note: this book is only available used.
4,Inexpensive Memory,Works fine in my wife's camera. She can take pictures 'til her eyeballs fall out. Now I've got to find an equally high capacity battery.
1,Buyer Beware!!!,I got to the check out before I noticed the EXPONENTIAL SHIPPING COSTS charged by wonder electronics!!!I ordered 5 SD memory cards and a tiny usb card reader for a grand total of US$ 41.22 and they tried to charge US$ 61.20 shipping!!!I thought it was a mistake. I went back and looked everything over and all I can figure is they must be claiming the things weigh several pounds each and shipping them seperatly. We did a bit of investigation and found that this not new for this company and they do not ship each item seperate so draw your own conclusions.Buyer Beware indeed and shame on Amazon for letting it continue this long.
5,Great SD Card,Card is super. Holds approx 249 1200 x 800 pictures. Would hold much more at a different setting.
4,good product.. expensive shipping,"the seller I got it from ripped off on shipping. But I expensed it for the office, so no lost on my part. Keep in mind the shipping charges from some of the seller on here when you buy things."
5,Kingston 512 SD Card,"I bought theses two cards as a gift for my two daughters, to use in new cameras each received for Christmas. They both love the performance of the chips. I received them on time with no problem.Thanks for the good service."
5,"Great price, great performance","I bought this for use with my new Canon Powershot A610 camera. It came out of the package, went in to the camera, and worked well immediately. I couldn't ask for more- especially at this price. Kingston is a very well respected memory manufacturer, too."
4,digital card,I have received my digital card for my camera. It works wonderful and the price was fabulous.
3,Card OK but not for use with high resolution cameras,"I bought this card when I purchased a 7 MP camera (Nikon Coolpix 7900). I love the camera, but the slow speed of this SD card makes it sluggish when taking pictures. I haven't had any problems with the card, so I am not saying it is a bad card. It is just not fast enough for a high resolution camera. So I am buying another high speed SD card, and intend to use this card as an emergence backup."
3,It doesn't work,"I bought this for my vacation photos, but it turns out not to be compatible with my camera. I thought they were all pretty much the same, but apparently that isn't true. If you're not sure what kind of card your camera can read, be sure to look it up before you buy it.I've tried this one in three different cameras, but it doesn't work with any of them. I don't think the card's defective, but we haven't been able to figure out what this card would work with."
4,Free memory is always good,Got this memory for free when I purchased the Canon G7. Free is always a good thing.S. Joe Wynman
4,Well... just a memory card,"It has been with me for two months now, no problems so far...I guess it's hard to review a memory card, go for the cheapest one if you know that the manufacturer will respond in case of failure..."
5,"Works great, never had a problem","I've used this for over a year now, never had any kind of problem with it."
5,excellent value,The product came shortly after they confirmed order..It is as advertised by the vendor.. I am very satisfied.
4,Overall Satisfied,"Works great in my digital camera, which was the primary reason for purchasing it, but not as well in my Dell Axim X-50 PDA. It takes some determination to figure out how to transer the files and pictures taken are not in the correct format."
5,Works fine in my MP3 player and for file transfer,"No problems, over the last two months, works like a champ. Kind of mad that the standard for everything is shifting towards SD, because I like the extra storage capacity of CF and it seems a little sturdier to me. I used to buy Crucial or SanDisk, but now Kingston is all I own. I've had no problems with the other Kingston chips (CF) that I've had for the past year and they all seem more than fast enough to keep up with my other portable devices."
4,No problems,I rated this product four instead of five just because i haven't had it long enough to attest to its long term performance. It is what it says it is. performs well at a low price.
1,Kingston 512MB digital card -- forget about it,".... capacity lousy, very little, if any, better than the 16MB that came with camera, as standard equipment. Yikes!"
5,Does Its Job Well,"I've had two of these cards for over a month for a digital camera and they work great. At first, I was a little hesitant to buy this card, as it is such a low-priced product compared to other brands.But, I am extremely pleased with my purchase!!!You will not be disappointed. This card is fast and does a great job and is a GREAT BUY FOR ITS PRICE!"
4,Good Quality at a reasonable price,The kingston 512MB/SD card was purchased for my PDA. Loads fairly simple which I would imagine any SD card would do. I'm very impressed by the company ability to offer a good product at a reasonable price.
3,wrong order,"i ordered this pair of sunglasses in red trim and i got a pair of silver tone aviators. i was dissapointed but the company offered to give me a refund and told me to keep the old sunglasses, so overall i would do buiness with them again."
1,WORST SUNGLASSES,this product is worst not good at all. i used it for a day or so what ever was shown on pic does not match.
5,The shade souce review,"These sun glasess are great i like the style and they are really comfortable the spring hinge always keeps them in place, im a letter carrier with the post office so im always moving around so keeping the glases in place is great, very good product."
5,Great Family Film,"Great Product!I bought this DVD for my little sister for Christmas! What a great movie, she LOVES it. I enjoyed it also. Great film for family and little ones."
5,A Wonderful Family Movie,I didn't realize that this was based on a true story until after we watched it. What a great story. I recommend this one to anyone with kids!
2,Way too creepy for me.,"Although at first glance this movie seems like a cute story, the general idea behind it disturbed me. Why did this woman dress chimps up like people and try to get them behave like human children? Animals aren't people, and they certainly don't want to be treated like they are--it's not healthy for them or for their owners, as was illustrated by the problems Gertrude Lintz had in keeping Buddy. The film doesn't seem to get it's own message."
1,Found it irritating,"I thought it would be cute but it's just a crazy rich woman who indulges her love of animals by turning her home into a zoo. For some reason, instead of amusing me, it annoyed me. Dressing chimps as people and treating them like spoiled children. And she does the same with the gorilla, Buddy. She first saved Buddy but instead of using common sense, she decides to try to make it as human as possible. Of course, he turns on her later and she finds out that yes, gorillas are wild animals.People who want to see animals in human terms annoy me sometimes. I remember once reading about a woman who was kicked in the face by a moose up in the mountains. Well, what did she think ""Hey, it's Bullwinkle!"" and try to pet it?I think it also upset me because I was thinking she could have adopted children instead of making chimps into kids. But perhaps it was best she didn't. She would have messed them up by indulging their every whim.BTW, this movie is based on a true story."
3,Mildy entertaining for animal lovers,"Set in the 1920s, Buddy follows the true adventures of loopy lady Gertrude ""Trudy"" Lintz (Rene Russo) who likes to take her menagerie of animals to the movies (and you thought the crying baby two rows back was bad). After one such outing, she has occasion to adopt a sickly baby gorilla. She names him Buddy, and takes him home to her M.D. husband (Robbie Coltrane) to see if he can cure the petite primate. Buddy is never portrayed by a real gorilla; the infant version was animatronic and the adult gorilla was a human in gorilla suit. However, there are several other real animals in the movie including dogs, cats, horses, and chimpanzees. The chimps are seen riding a pony, pouring themselves a drink, shaking hands, and even using a key to unlock a door. Based upon the memoir by Gertrude Davis Lintz.Staci Layne Wilson"
5,PRAISE FOR A GREAT FILM,"I FIRST SAW THIS FIM MANY YEARS AGO ON HBO.MOST OF THE FILMS MADE TODAY ARE CRAP COMPARED TO THIS WONDERFULLY ENTERTAINING FILM.I WOULD RECCOMEND""BUDDY""TO ADULTS AND CHILDREN ALIKE.THIS HAS AND ALWAYS WILL BE A FAVORITE OF MINE THAT I WILL NEVER TIRE OF WATCHING."
5,nicolas's review,"A fantastic story from the Redwall series, Martin the Warrior, is a mix of friendship and battles against a ruthless rat clan. This ""National best seller"" from Brian Jacques is about a mouse named Martin, who gets captured in the rat's prison. This story is full of foxes, lizards, moles, rats, and of course, mice. Most fantasy lovers and animal lovers will keep rereading this fantastic book about how friendship can help others in times of conflict. As most good stories are, all Brian Jacques books are well more than worth reading. And all animals have human characteristics."
5,This is the best Redwall book,This is by far the best redwall book. it is so full of action and aventure i greatly recomend that you read this book it is realy GOOD thee best REDWALL RULES!!!
4,Hero of Redwall,"A classic tale of good versus evil. This is the story of how Martin the Warrior rose from humble beginnings as a slave mouse to become the champion of Redwall. This book has an action packed story line. The friends, despite being forest creatures, are larger than life. They include the mousemaid Rose, the vengeful Felldoh, and even a traveling troop of comics. They and others are pitted against Badrang, former sea rat captain, now Tyrant of Marshank.Although this is the sixth book in the series, it can be read first because the books were written out of sequence and this is the prequal to the other stories. Mossflower is the next book in the sequence.I would recommend this book to anybody who enjoys fantasy or children's literature. The only reason this gets four stars is because Jacques spends an inordinate amount of time writing about food or supper-time."
5,Most Wonderful Book Ever!,I loved this book. Everyone should read it. It is gripping the way the animals in this book journey thorugh many dangerous places all for the sake of freedom and their friends. In the end I felt terribly sad at the end because it was over even though I couldn't put the book down when I was reading it. Like I said before everyone should read this book.
5,THIS IS AN AMAZING BOOK!,I have just finished this book about three or so days ago and I loved it! I have also read Redwall and loved it! I highly recommend that you read this book! If you are not a fan of Brian Jacques books you will be! The characters are richly described. Brian Jacques makes his characters overflow with life! The feasts that he describes will make you hunger as you read it! There is so much exciting things that go on that keep you on the edge of your seat with a tremendous urge to flip the page! Brian Jacques describes battles so vividly that you feel like you're an onlooker in the story. I highly recommend that you READ THIS BOOK! I am now reading Salamandastron and I think that it is even better than Martin the Warrior! My only complaint is that you can not rate this book as a ten star book!
2,This book was hard and boring.,It has too much stuff happening with the food and the two different journeys. It was hard.
2,boring!,I didn't like this book. The only reason I read it was because we had to read it for school. It was really confusing and it seemed endless. I totally hated this book. But for people who like animal books and action packed books this would be good for you. Brian Jacques must put lots of work into his books for them to be so detailed but I definately hated this book. That's my own opinion and I respect that other people might like the book.
2,I've read better,"It wasn't that good. It was so predictible. I've read A LOT a books that are a lot more tragic than this one. If you want a tragic book thats really sad, I suggest you look somplace else, also if you want violence."
2,This book was pretty boring,This book is for people who like fantsy. It is pretty boring. You could get mixed up with the charecters because there are a lot of them.
1,MARTIN,"I think that this book was very dull and hard to get into. I would not recomend this for young readers for the diolect of the moles is hard to read and understand.They Speak in a british accent. the book it'self is hard to get into because after a little bit, it starts to switch back and forth between settings because the characters get split up. it is very hard to keep track of what is going on. i give this book a 1/10."
4,"Eh... Not Jacques Best, But Definitely Has Its Bright Points","Before reading martin the warrior, I became excited. Very excited. This was the guy who founded Redwall Abbey, the guy whom Matthias looked up to for inspiration. This guy overshadowed the main section of the Redwall timeline. This book had a lot going for it in terms of the setting, as a kind of prequel.The execution, however, is not so great. Yes, Jacques does avoid most of the pitfalls that many authors fall into when writing prequels; ie: you know what's going to happen, down to the letter. But the story doesn't come off as the strongest, with virtually no memorable characters save for Martin, who is a pretty strong lead with no posse to support his personality.This book is worth reading as part of the Redwall series, but as a stand alone isn't all that compelling.3.5 stars"
5,One of the best in the Redwall series,"Martin the Warrior was mentioned in Redwall and prominently featured in Mossflower. However, this book truly centers around him, and is an amazing book about the history of one of Redwall's finest heroes. I like how Brian Jacques doesn't write his books in time-linear sequence, because it's nice to get these nice background stories after a primary universe/canon has been established. Next to 'Legend of Luke' (another fabulous prequel to Redwall) this book stands as one of the best stories of the Redwall universe."
4,A Terrific Book,"If you liked any of the other Brian Jaques books you might like the ""Redwall"" series.A particularly good ""Redwall"" book is ""Martin The Warrior"". The book takes place before the ""Redwall ""abbey was created. The characters are animals who act like humans in the somewhat olden times.Martin is an adventurous warrior mouse who plans revenge on Badrang the evil stoat who is building a fortress called Marshank .Meanwhile Rose the squirrel,Grumm the mole, Brome the brother of Rose, and many other friends wind up with Martin as the slaves in Marshank plan a mutiny against Badrang and his followers.""Martin The Warrior"" isn't the only brilliant book by Brian Jaques there is also the other ""Redwall"" ""Castaways Of TheFlying Dutchman""Redwall"" book but is really good.I really liked ""Martin The Warrior"" along with many other Redwall books. I would definently recommend that book."
5,Fantastic!!!,"The greatest Redwall book ever written, indeed one of the greatest books ever written that I have read yet. A must-read for anybody with a liking for reading. I highly recommend buying this book."
5,One of Brian's best books,I think this book is very good. Martin the warrior was gripping! It had a excellent plot.
4,It was SO SAD!!,"I love Redwall and I've read all the books. This one, while still excellent and exciting, was REALLY, REALLY, REALLY SAD!!! I cried at the end. Read this book, but be forewarned."
5,Read it,Please just READ THIS BOOK! and the rest of the Redwall series. Just do it. The characters seem almost human! Please? You don't know what you're missing!
5,The best Redwall book you will ever read!,Redwall fans will love this book. It's an action packed thriller that will keep you reading till the very end. It's about a brave mouse called Martain the Warrior whose trying to kill the evil Badrang and stop slavery in Redwall. Martain faces many dangers through out the book. If you're looking for a good book buy this one now!
4,Martin the Warrior my point of view,I didn't like Martin the Warrior because there was hardley any battles
3,"Big fan of Redwall series, but disappointed with Martin","Martin the Warrior really lacked excitement unlike the other books. It really was pretty boring compared to the other Redwall books. I would have given it a two in a half, but you can't. Don't let this review scare you away from other Redwall books. They are all 10 star books."
5,Wonderfully thrilling,"From a 14 year old's opinion, this is a superb book. It has an adventursome plot that is thrilling and captures your attentions to the very end. It is easy to follow, but yet not predicatable. Even though the characters are animals you can relate to them well. The ending is very suprizing. There is so much I could say about this book, but if you want to see how wonderful it really is, you should read it for your self along with Brian Jacque's other Redwall books such as Redall and Mossflower."
5,The best of Jacques' books,"This book is one of the best written, best story, best everything of all books. I don't think anybody could have made a better book. The other books are also good, especialy at the end. Like on Salamandastron: It ended with Urthstripe leaping off the crater of Salamandastron, crushing Ferhago in the death leap. If you want a good book to read, read Martin The Warrior!!!"
3,"VANITY, ALL IS VANITY","Yes, believe it or not even an old witch with a really unattractive long pointed proboscis can be vain. This we discover as she first begins her search for a bat.As many of us know sometimes we can start out looking for one thing and find something totally different. Such was the case with the witch who came across a cat, a skeleton, a mummy, a really odd assortment of findings.Why she wanted any of these things is eventually revealed as the rhyming story unfolds."
2,Disappointing,"As a huge fan of Catrow's illustrations, I really looked forward to showing this book to my son. And the pictures were great, which is the only thing that saved this book from a one-star review. The text is awful. Many of the verses don't rhyme, and they don't follow the meter of the original ""I Know An Old Lady..."" properly so reading this out loud is very awkward. The ""reasons"" for swallowing everything are boring and the ending - why she wanted the bat in the first place - is a big letdown. If you like Catrow's pictures as much as we do, this is worth a look through. But as a funny poem it fails miserably."
1,CHANGED INGREDIANTS!,"I was a devout Mychelle buyer and loved their products. I bought and returned this item recently when I noticed most of the ingrediants had been changed to cheaper ones. I still have a jar of the original stuff and have searched the internet to find some of the original but cant. Here are some of the first ingrediants in the original one: cherry puree, d-cranberry complex puree, pumpkin puree, apple puree, blueberry puree, jasmine alchohol...and so on. the new jar has the first ingrediant of water and other inexpensive ingreds. I also noticed the new one didnt smell anywhere as good as the old one, and was loaded with xantham gum! so in other words, your still paying a very high price for something that has changed significantly, and without them notifying it on the jar.p.s. talked to someone at wholefoods about it and she said much of their line has changed to cheaper componets."
5,Fruit Fiesta Peel takes years off my skin!,"I am 40 with mixed oily and dry/wrinkled skin. The fruit fiesta peel (used alternatively with the pumpkin peel) has taken years off my appearance, reduced wrinkles, eliminated blackheads, and has pretty much eliminated acne breakouts. It burns a bit (which means it's working). I use it 1-2 times per week and the pumpkin peel 1-2 times per week.This product is 100% natural, smells delicious, and my skin glows and looks so fresh and new after I wash it off!"
3,not impressed,"this isn't doing it for me. I get 'brighter' results from a mud mask. when its gone, I'm done"
1,Nauseating smell,"I have sensitive skin, but immediately upon applying this mask, my skin started to burn. Not tingle, burn. I may have had an allergic reaction, but I highly recommend that people start with a sample. Obviously, my skin reaction meant that I can't use the product, but even if that wasn't a factor, the smell was putrid. It smells like decaying fruit. Quite nasty. Bottom line: Before potentially wasting your money on this, try to find a sample somewhere."
2,Broke Me Out...,"I have combination skin and usually have no problem with peels or enzyme masks of any kind. However, this broke me out terribly after using it. I tried it several times to see if my skin was just ""purging"" but my skin always had the same reaction. I am really sad because I had high hopes for this product line because it seemed to have great reviews, but I am continually unimpressed each time I try something by them. Perhaps it is because they have changed their formulas and are using cheaper ingredients? I'm not sure. All I know is this one does not work for me."
1,Very disappointing...,"I bought this item from all the 5-star reviews it received on Amazon. Unfortunately, I can't say the same as the other reviewers. This product did absolutely nothing for my skin; no peeling, no glow, barely a tingle. I doubt I will purchase any of their other products and definitely would not recommend this product to anyone."
2,Looks like all the 5 star reviews come from years ago,"How you do rate a product you have not used? MY low star review is not due to my using the product - but rather the fact that the product has obviously changed formulation over time and all the newer reviews claim that the it is different than in the past - now using cheaper ingredients. The old posts give glowing praises - the newer ones NOT. So, I guess I will skip this product line and try something else."
4,Signet of Atlantis,Very interesting book makes one really wonder what this is all about. It promises some surprising info.Arrived on time and in good condition.
2,Its not bad its just a remake ..,"At some point in the 50's the studios managers probably thought to themself "".. hey why try make new good films , lets just do remakes of old b&w ones in COLOR ... and turn them into MUSICALS .. "" YUCK .Even with the new color and sound the outcome was often pale in comparison to the original , see ""The Philadelphia Story"" instead for the real thing .The remake scheme just doesn't work , just look at ""The planet of the apes"" as an example . And now they are throwing ""The italian job"" at us .. they should have made it a musical :-) Imagine marky singing a cheerfull tune while driving in a mini ."
1,"Alas, another remake.",Making this a musical with Bing Crosby isn't a bad idea. Making it advertize the Jazz Fest and him doing Jazz is. I've never cared for Frank Sinatra's singing and hearing his sour notes with Bing's voice makes him even worse. The only redeeming value is Shatch! They should have let Grace be a Princess and not encourage her terrible acting skills.
3,"Great movie, poor picture.","""High Society"" ranks high among my all-time favorite movies and the DVD does an acceptable job of presenting it. The color and sound quality do the movie justice. The ""matted"" widescreen format was a bit unpleasant and disappointing. It, perhaps, works well on a widescreen TV. On my standard screen it causes the scene to be somewhat squeezed together. The extras that give some insight into the making of this classic were somewhat enjoyable."
2,Hard to watch.,"I suppose if I'd seen this movie before I saw The Philadelphia Story, I would have liked it but such was not the case. I'd seen The Philadelphia Story many many times before seeing High Society, so that made it hard to enjoy. Some of the dialogue in the original movie was ad-libbed which added to its charm. But to hear Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra quoting them was kind of like nails on a chalk board. I'm not saying it wasn't a good movie, but for the die-hard Cary Grant fans, it may not go down easy. But watch it for yourself, don't let me influence you."
4,Not highly recommended for hard of hearing.,"You can't go wrong with a Bing Crosby movie. The only reason why it's getting four stars (instead of five) is because the movie is not closed captioned all the way through. The dialogue is captioned, but the songs are not."
2,"So many star, so disappointed","I love Bing, Frank and Grace but not in this movie. The singing was great but not much else. :("
5,great escapist entertainment,"This is by no means acted any better than it's source (The Philadelphia Story), but it's great escapist entertainment, with good music, pretty people, and a fun story. It always lifts my spirits."
3,it was alright,"this film is a remake,but it was alright on it's on. Bing Crosby&Frank Sinatra were alright,but Louis Armstrong really stood out in this film. I watched it recently&it was cool,but you don't watch this film for Acting. the Music sells it."
2,Not as good as I thought it would be.,"High Society does not even compare to the superb direction of The Philadelphia Story. Although I am a huge fan of both Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra, the acting in this film was lacking. No disrespect to Grace Kelly, but she doesn't hold a flame to Katharine Hepburn. Kelly's portrayal of Tracy Lord was horrific at best. Not only was the acting inferior, but also the musical numbers were shockingly dull, the best parts were the rhythmic stylings of Louis Armstrong. I recommend that if you watch this film try not to compare it with The Philadelphia Story, because it will only disappoint you."
3,"Cute, Great Cast, But...","This is a fantastic story and a fantastic cast, very talented musically. But, the score does not make up for the plot it forces aside. This is not the best movie for any of these actors. Interesting to compare to The Philadelphia Story, but if you only have time for one--watch the original."
2,"If you love Philadelphia Story, You May Be Disappointed with This Film...","I consider ""Philadelphia Story"" one of the most entertaining films in my movie collection. So, when I found out there was a remake, I thought, ""Why not?"" The sets and production values of ""High Society"" are much better than the original, but I found it far less entertaining, less believable, and the acting far less engaging. Others may go on and on about this movie, but I was disappointed. Nothing new with far less vitality than the original."
3,FOR COLE PORTER,"COLE PORTER's last good score for the movies is the main thing here, since this remake of THE PHILADELPHIA STORY is uninspired.It's fun to see three legends in the same film ,but it is also sad that this was the only real teaming of FRANK with his idol BING.It was simply an impossible task for GRACE KELLY to walk in the footsteps of KATHARINE HEPBURN ,but her beauty compensates a lot.A product typical of M-G-M,s galaxy of stars.Enjoy TRUE LOVE,MIND IF I MAKE LOVE TO YOU,WELL DID YOU EVAH and forget the rest."
2,"THE ORIGINAL ""PHILADELPHIA STORY"" IS STILL THE GREATEST!","High Society is a feeble musical re-make of the sophisticated classic ""The Philadelphia Story."" Grace Kelly, although beautiful and elegant as usual, tries to simulate the same qualities as Katherine Hepburn in the original, but almost seems like a caricature. Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra are just not believable and somehow the dialogue sounds unrealistic and stilted. One song, ""True Love"", emerges as a winner, but the entire film appears to be a waste of talent. If it ain't broke, don't fix it......stick with the original ""Philadelphia Story"" with Kate Hepburn, Cary Grant and James Stewart."
5,fun and classy,"This movie has class and is true entertainment. A romantic story which has one of hollywoods most beautiful legends, Grace Kelly. Grace and Bing remind of the days I miss."
2,High Society,"The format on this DVD has been altered from the original wide screen version to one that fills a standard television screen. Thus, the image is squeezed into the middle, making the characters very tall and slender. This version is hard on the eyes after a few minutes."
5,High Sociey,"Absolutely one of the best movies of its ilk of all time! Great fun, light, fabulous to look at, super catchy songs, and the best collection of great actors! I LOVE High Society!!!!"
4,High Society,Thought I was buying a CD of the movie soundtrack. Instead I received a DVD of the movie. I must look more closelly.
3,See it if you like singing -- NOT if you like acting,"As others have said this is a remake of the Philadelphia story. Grace Kelley, who must be one of the more overrated actresses, plays the role that was done well by Katherine Hepburn. Bing Crosby just doesn't fit as the sort of eccentric millionaire that Cary Grant pulled off. Frank Sinatra sings well but his role didn't match that of Jimmy Stewart's frustrated writer. Bing and Frank sing well. Louis Armstrong is great. The movie probably stands fine if you hadn't seen Philadelphia Story before. It's kind of like when you think a book is better than the movie because of all the shortcuts the movie has to make for time sake.Overall it's a cute story, moderate acting, great singing. If you like real acting though try the Philadelphia Story instead."
5,Bing Crosby and Grace Kelly in High Society,"This is truly a 5 star movie.....it's a collector! The story has Grace, Bing, Sinatra, Lund, and especially Satchmo. The story is about a heiress who is engaged to one man, attracted to another, and maybe in love again with her ex-husband; it is a reinvention of the Philadelphia Story; has a Cole Porter score. A great movie made in 1956!"
5,great film,"It's nice to watch the ""old stuff"": good quality entertainment (much better than the gratuitous violence in the modern stuff). The movie actually has a plot, good story content, great music (all those things missing from modern movies!)"
4,Great Musical For Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra,"Great songs with clever background story of ""Philadelphia Story"". Beautiful Grace Kelly. We miss all these stars, but can see them all here."
5,High Society,"The songs ... the stars ... the settings! Listen carefully to catch all the wordplay. It's a ""feel-good"" movie that lifts the spirit everytime you watch."
1,Great actores - Bad remake from original,"If you would like some great entertainment then get the original - The Philadelphia Story with Cary Grant, Katharine Hepburn, and James Stewart. You won't be dissapointed."
2,For the masses only,"This book is seriously marred by several factual and etymological errors. If you are serious about language and etymology, stick with something more interesting, like the dictionary."
2,Book was okay....,"It took me a while to get through this book. When I first saw the book I thought it would be interesting because I always like to know the why and where things come from. I thought it would be cool to know where some common phrases and what is behind the words.This book was not that good to me and is the major reason it took me so long to finish it. I do like the fact that it is broken up into categories and different areas that words fit in. It is organized well and it is easy to find words or phrases you might be interested in, but just reading to be reading it does not make a good read.I think it is good to keep like a bathroom book or just around when you want to see if you can find the meaning of a word or phrase."
3,Why do we say that?,"It's just as the title says What's In A Word? Fascinating stories of more than 350 everyday words and phrases. If you have ever questioned where a word came from, Webb Garrison has conveniently structured this book into chapters of different types of words. Garrison provides you with background knowledge of each of the words and a brief example.It is in the form of a dictionary, making it easy for you to look up a word or phrase with the flip of a couple of pages. It's a great book to have on the coffee table, or beside the toilet for easy reading or a conversation starter. Garrison makes it easy to enjoy, with adding in a few witty comments, keeping it a fun read.Pick it up and start learning about where words and phrases such as wedlock, floppies, x for kiss, and in the groove originated from."
2,try a little harder,"It was entertaining but screamed low budget. I could have handled the horrible werewolf costume and plot but the acting was buy far the worst I have ever seen. Everything else was awesome. The location was original, the gore was good. All that being said I do plan on keeping my DVD and watching it on nights when I get drunk with my friends."
1,Mods v Rockers -Buyer Beware,Be warned. This collection consists largely of second-rate re-makes (with the exception of Del Shannon's 'Runaway' and a few others). If your looking for 'End of the World' by Skeeter Davis (as advertised)...forget it...instead you will find a poor re-make of 'Terry' by Twinkle. Serious collectors of golden oldies - DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS COLLECTION.
5,A lovely collection perfect for a romantics!,"Filled with 28 love stories, this collection is sure to satisfy romantics as well as ""budding"" romantics. With such steller writers as Aldous Huxley and Virginia Woolf on hand, the lucky reader is sure to be entertained, enlightened and charmed. Although there are plenty of typical romances here, many of the stories are far from conventional as well, ranging from romantic comedies (H.G. Well's Miss Winchelsea's Heart) to the ironic (Graham Greene's The Blue Film)."
1,mumbo-jumbo tripe.,Biggest load of codswallop I've had the displeasure of spending money on. Buy icecream instead.
5,Quantum-Touch book,Excellent condition and delivered quickly. The information in this book is facinating and shows once again that there is more to us than we might believe. I have already successfullyused the Quantum-Touch methods described in this book. Thank you.
2,more brown than red,"The garnets in these earrings are more brown than red. They are still OK, just not what I expected since garnets are red."
5,"Easy to read, difficult to forget","In twelve short stories, Garcia Marquez proves that he is not only capable of writing deeply, he is capable of writing concisely. The stories in this book are extremely thought provoking, relating to the human spirit and little oddities about people.There is one story in particular that I will not forget. It is about a woman who gets stranded with a flat tire, and hitches a ride with a bus to a mental institution. The story unfolds from there, and I don't think I have ever felt so deeply troubled by a single story like I was in this case. Of the twelve stories, I liked 8 or 9, the others were a little boring (or maybe I did not get them). I highly recommend it, especially for those who do not have the patience to read GM's ""One Hundred Years of SOlitude"" and would like an intro to the author."
4,Pleasantly typical,"What an ideal book for my Garcia Marquez collection. Some stories appear to have no point--but that's a North American viewpoint. South Americans: ""It is what It Is."" My favorite story about children turning on the lights in their apartment and being magically realistic is in this collection. Short story books serve two purposes for me: One, when I can't sleep and need a boost toward dreamland, and Two, the paperback is easy to cart around while I'm in waiting rooms for appointments. The book can also serve as a ""test run"" for a new reader who wants to sample his style, characters, sentences ending in ways you'd never expect but can appreciate, and plots (some, ""sort of"")."
4,"Funny, ferocious, moving","Twelve short stories presenting a variety of strange character. There is a former President who is proud to have been long forgotten. Margarito Duarte with his desperate quest to meet the Pope so that he can show him the corpse of his holy daughter. A passenger desperately wanting to talk to a dazzling but sleeping woman on a flight from Paris to New York. Frau Frieda whose profession it is to dream. The Venezuelan writer who owns a haunted castle near Arezzo. Maria dos Prazeres wishes to be buried in a place high above water level. Prudencia Linero has sworn to God to wear a bizarre costume till her death if she is given the opportunity to speak to the Pope. A porter driven crazy by the Tramontane wind in Cadaques. The suicide of Mrs Forbes, a perverse old lady. A group of children drowning for failing to master the ""art of navigating in the light"". And finally the sinister trip of Nena Daconte and Billy Sanchez from Madrid to Paris."
4,Beautiful,"The stories in Gabriel Garcia Marquez's book are so beautiful. He has managed to write stories about things that people go through in life but in a way that no one could describe. I thought that the story ""Sleeping Beauty and the Airplane"" was wonderful and it seemed so different from most stories. I loved this book and if you like stories that have a little bit of a twist to them read this book."
1,DO WE NOT GET IT...,"Enrique's ""Escape"" is HORRIBLE.He can barely sing.The songs are SOOOOOOO corny it's a wonder how a music-buying public that supposedly reviles such acts as Vanilla Ice and Barry Manilowwould embrace such shoddily made music.""Hero"" is a horrid balladwith AWFUL vocals courtsey of Enrique and the laughable ""DontTurn Off The Light"".The music is so CORNY and silly sounding.People take this seriously?Why do Ricky Martin,Marc Anthony,and Shakira-along with Enriquedo the most horrendous music in English while they make first-rate music in their native tongue?RASPBERRY!"
2,songs are somewhat catchy but lame,"In English Enrique is just producing more bubble gum. Although his pop in Spanish had some depth, this cd is just hard to listen to at points. Hero is catchy and ok for a while and I like the beat to Love to see you cry, but it makes no sense!Many of the songs seem lame, I will survive, and his music just seems to be sung for the heck of it.A donde vas Enrique?"
5,Again one of the best!!!,"This is again one of his master pieces. Enrique only knows how to make the best CDs which takes your mind off everything stressfull. I really like his music, it really calms you."
4,Be My Hero,"The CD Escape I found to be entertaining. It is a CD I would enjoy listening to on a regular basis. The lyrics to the songs in Escape are very romantic, and the music goes from slow and romantic to more upbeat rhythms. Its one of those CDs you could sit down and listen to or get up and dance to. Although Enrique Iglesias may not have the best vocals, the passion he sings with enables the listener to focus more on the lyrics because they're sang with great meaning. This CD also provides the listener a taste of spanish lyrics, that anyone including the non spanish speaker, can listen to and enjoy."
5,I think is a great CD,"I'm a really fan of Enrique, and I have been waiting for this CD since the last one, I think is great, the music is always like him, is to bad that there is only three songs in spanish, but I think is awesome.The Song that I most like is ""Don't turn off the light"" and ""hero"", well actually I like all the CD.Creo que este Cd es otra obra más de Enrique y su música no ha cambiado en nada a las de los otros CD. Es fantástico. Me fascina"
3,Where's the Latin Influence??,"I love Enrique Iglesias, I have his ""Cosas Del Amor"", ""The Best Hits"", ""Enrique"" and now ""Escape"". I found his latest release ""Escape"" to be too mainstream too much like English pop with too much electronic beat in the background. I liked ""Enrique"" better-- more of a latin influence even though it is an English release. I still enjoy ""Escape"" but I would have liked more latin influence and more ballads. All that electronic noise hides his beautiful, sensitive, romantic voice. By the way that is coming from an English speaking person--I don't understand a word of his Spanish but I love it.Also Enrique is gorgeous, sexy what is he doing with that awful cap on in the video and the pictures included in the CD? I say lose the cap!! Love the Hero video--when is he going to release a DVD of a concert or even a music video compilation--come on Ricky Martin has a few out already!!"
3,Who is he trying to be?,"I love Enrique, really I do but this cd let me down. Who is he trying to be with lyrics such as ""she be the one....She be the bomb""?!?!? She be the bomb? what? No one says that anymore that is from 2 or 3 years ago. He is trying to sound black, is that it? I loved the ""Enrique"" cd it had so much passion. This one doesn't have that. It doesn't have the emotions you can actually feel just by hearing the songs. I must admit Hero or course is good but some of the other songs on this are just plain dumb."
4,Great Soloist,"Escape is a great sensual yet funky cd that i feel is is one worth owning. My favourite tracks are Hero (huge commercial sucess), I Will Survive, Maybe, One Night Stand and If The World Crashes. Enrique has shown that he didnt cash in of the craze, and in fact he is a top artist that can sing and perform just as well as anyone else in the music business"
5,BEST ALBUM EVER!,"this is a fantastic album, well what is there to expect from a fantastic artist, but this album tops everything!"
4,Always great to see an Iglesias!!,"The beauty about Enrique is the massive improvement he has gone through since his first album. I have been a huge fan of his father for years and so when I heard Enrique was recording, it brought overwhelming amounts of joy. In so much as the Iglesias name will continue to generate music for more and more generations to come.Admittedly I didn't take well to his first 2 albums, his 3rd was a lot better. Then he catapulted with Balamos!! Huge!! Now he's finding his step and crusing forward. This is an album which will do well. I suppose that only down side is that the Latin feeling has almost gone. But being Enrique, it is in his blood so it will always be there. Like all Iglesias music, I can never get enough and am always looking forward to the next album. I look forward to being involved with his music."
3,Don't mean to be picky,"I purchased this CD for my wife. Although I am not a fan, I did decide to give it a listen and try to be unbiased. I was pleasantly surprised by what I heard. Sounding somewhat like Ace of Base (on some songs), the tunes were catchy and were enjoyable to listen to. That is until I got to track 11. It really bothers me when artists include re-mixes of songs that are already on the CD in another language. If Enrique wants to be a cross over artist, he should produce an English CD for the North American audience and a Spanish CD for his Latin fans. Or at the very least include three songs that are not already on the CD in Spanish."
2,Disappointing,"His new CD was a major disappointment for me. I expected songs like his last CD, his old spanish songs, or even like the single ""Hero"", which is great. However, most of the stuff on this new cd have this cheesy dance beat running though them. It sounds hollow and flimsy. I'd sell back the cd, but i'd never make back what i paid for it."
5,I'm addicted!,"I first heard this album when a friend of mine put ""Escape"" on and somehow hit ""repeat."" I was totally captured by his voice and made a fan immediately. I finally broke down and bought this album."
5,Enrique's best album to date,"I really love the sound & the direction that Enrique took with this album. ""Hero"" was a great choice as first single & is very heartwrenching. The Spanish version is equally as good. His voice is so soothing & sexy at the same time. You can really tell he means what he is singing about. Other album favorites of mine are ""Love 4 Fun"", ""Escape"", ""Maybe"" & ""I Love To See You Cry"". This album is a genious when it comes to the sound, the lyrics & the vocals. In all these ways, this album is complete. It's a great album to play on a road trip or just on a long, stressful day when you need to relax. Go pick up this album & Enrique's new album ""Seven"". Because as good as this one is, I've heard his new one & it's even better."
4,Very Good,"I bought the album just for the song Hero. However after listening to the entire album, I found that I had a real good one."
5,More Great Music,"All I have to say is if you are even remotely a fan of his music, this is a MUST HAVE CD. Worth every penny I paid for it."
4,Much better than his first,"His first album wasn't really too good, but this one definitely is. Enrique is definitely a romantic crooner, as is obvious by his excellent rendition of the song 'Hero'. Although he does sound weird doing fast songs, I don't think he should stop singing them. His slow, sentimental style adds a unique edge to dance music. Among my favourites are 'Escape', 'Love to see You Cry' and 'One Night Stand' and of course 'Hero' (although it sounds WAY better in Spanish). Overall, this is an album where all the tracks are solid rather than one being spectacular and the rest filler material. It's a good buy."
4,Enrique at his best...,"I fell in love with this album years ago and hadn't heard it since. Several months ago I found my copy of the CD but was heart broken at how scratched up it had gotten. I knew I HAD to have it again.The incredible sounds on this CD definitely makes me want to ""escape""."
1,enrique is da best,"I like the albulm and millions have said yes.it gose down my heart.when it plays i dont think of skiping any songbut my best is HERO(Metromix)its one song that brings thunders in my heart.so do i ""DONT TURN OFF THE LIGHTS""Sh.. sh that songi do ever wonder where enrique just gets those words ,putting them together.Well nothing much to say just praises to his albulm."
2,I Love This CD,What people are saying about this CD is true because it is a very good cd. When I bought this cd I thought it [was bad] but when I got it I said wow this a good CD. I have being a fan of Enrique Iglesias since 1997.For me has a black man it real hard me tell people that I like Enrique...
3,Not his best,"His English self-titled album debut is one of my favorite.I listened to it everyday, and I mean ""everyday"". I bought it when it was release and I haven't get tired of it. So I was excited when this CD came out and grabbed it right away but I am mildly dismayed. I agree with one of the critics, Enrique needs to stay with romantic ballad. The passion of his voice is perfect for it.One felt like he is actually serenading you. I considered this CD pop dance just like most of the CD nowadays. It doesn't rise up above the rest. ""Hero"", which is a huge commercial success is the only one that sounds more like ""Enrique"". Overall, is not a bad buy but it's just of those CD that after a few play you will forget about it."
5,if anyone can put a girl in the mood,"Even you even feel the hint of the blues, put on Enrique. This album (and any other) is sure to help you bring sexy back."
1,Tough Cookie Tough to Digest,"I don't recommend this book to any serious fan of detective stories. Neither an Agatha Christie nor a Julia Childs, Ms Davidson creates a pedestrian work of fiction overly loaded with kitchen trivia and out of context recipies that lack most of the ingredients for a solid ""who done it."" Indeed, my reaction at the end was more like who cares who done it. Perhaps there are some useful hints for the budding chef but for me, I'll not bother with another of her books."
3,Tough to swallow,"This is the first book I have read by D. Mott and most likely the last. Unless a book is absolutely awful, I always make an attempt to finish it. I was determined to read Tough Cookie based on the positive reviews I had read. And I did finish it. But it took me more than 6 weeks! I think the reason why it took so long was because the book just rambled; in a nutshell, it was boring. For those of you who have run into the same problem, just hand in there. Around chapter 20 things start getting better. And by chapter 23, you can close the book and congratulate yourself for your perseverance."
1,"Annoying, ponderous and cloying writting & characters","The ""detective"" character, Goldy, is terribly annoying and way too cute for words. The books could easily be shortened by 100+ pages. Every detail however small and unimportant is described in excrutiating detail. Bad writing + bad character development = frustration. Don't waste your time and money with this crap. If you are looking for a non-professionsal female ""detective"" story try Murder on Martha's Vineyard by David Osborn."
2,Bad Batch,"The recipies are better than the plot. Chocolate Coma Cookies are wonderful, good as a muffin batter too... does anyone miss the shrimp currry recipe? It sounds awesome!"
2,Tough to Swallow,"Although a recipe for successful cookies is a good act to follow, a recipe for a cookie cutter mystery is no mystery at all. I have enjoyed Ms. Davidson's previous novels with a healthy appetite, always looking to return to her good cooking. But neither her recipes (my, goodness, Velveta! I'd rather have her recipe for meatballs.) nor her writing are at all tasty in this hastily thrown together goulash. Characters pop in and out (Marla, Julian, Tom) with no explanation and no reason except some nod to her loyal readers. A newcomer to this venue would be baffled by their ties to this self-centered caterer.And you know, this COULD have been a killer recipe -- good villain, multiple suspects, a friend in trouble, good setting, and good descriptions. But the book is much too insubstantial and the characters mere meringue.I hope that next time the author goes for more solid fare with much improved character development and motivation, better dialogue, and some stick to your ribs recipes."
2,overbaked,"Diane Mott Davidson has never met an adjective for which she couldn't find a use. Steaming, fragrant, sweet, soft...they're all here, and more. Despite likable, well-drawn characters, detailed cooking descriptions drag down a plot that's already on the edge of not-so-interesting. I did finish this novel -- all 319 paperback pages -- and am not particularly sorry I did, but never was I gripped. Near the end, a predictable self-induced crisis puts the heroine in mortal danger, from which she improbably escapes to see a neatly-wrapped conclusion in the last page or two."
2,Tough Cookie is a Limp Biscuit,"A faithful reader and re-reader of DMD's books, I eagerly awaited ""Tough Cookie"", as I have all of her ""Goldy the Caterer"" series. This one, though, failed to deliver.Many of her recipes seemed uninspired, the plot boring and the new characters very one-dimensional. This book seemed like it was written in a hurry, to meet a publisher's deadline, and with little imagination.I did enjoy the setting of a ski resort; I've never been to Colorado but DMD's descriptions are always wonderful and vivid. I feel like I would recognize that part of the country if I visited, just from reading her books.Normally I try to buy her books for the recipes; with this one, I wouldn't bother."
2,no respect for Goldy,Whenever Goldy does not follow her detective husband's advise about not going places and or doing things by herself; she ends up in DEEP trouble! This happens so many times (in almost every book) that I certainly have no sympathy for her. She is just plain hell-bent on doing her own thing. She has been hit over the head so many times when she doesn't respect her husband's advise--perhaps that is why she does such stupid things.
2,"Nice, sweet little mystery with some interesting recipes","I've read several of Diane Mott Davidson's Goldy Schultz mysteries, and find that they run along the same trail--someone gets murdered, and Goldy divides her time between investigating the murder and whipping up delicious food. ""Tough Cookie"" is no great departure from the formula. Everyone has their roles to play, and play them they do--from Goldy's brassy friend Marla to Goldy's abusive ex-husband (whose menacing appearances often jarringly distract from the rest of the story, which despite the murders and other goings-on tend to be quite fluffy). Why anyone would want to live in Aspen Meadows, which must have the highest per-capita murder rate in America judging by the books, is beyond me! Still, a pleasant read for those who like their murder mysteries on the lighter side. Good recipes, too."
4,Loved the book...But ....,"I loved this book. what an original concept! I couldn't put it down. I would sneak into the bathroom at work and read a few pages. I hide Tough Cookie among our many law books and pretend to be busy reading a certain case and would actually be reading about Goldy and her cooking/snooping or her relationship with her son Arch.The only problem I had was when she had that terrible car accident and went home and COOKED A WHOLE MEAL AND BAKED COOKIES...PLEEEEEESE. Otherwise the book was fantastic, especially all those wonderful recipes.I just ordered all DMD books (except Stones & Scones) and plan to have a great summer reading all of DMD books and trying out recipes."
4,Made me hungry!,"There was a book fair at work and this book was 50% off, so I bought it and read it in less than three days. I admit, this wasn't a real thriller type mystery, but it was very easy to read and I enjoyed it. So much, in fact, that I ordered all eight of her previous books. I plan to start with the first and read straight through to this one. It should be quite a trip!"
3,Pretty tasty,"I was very pleased with this book. I put off buying it, based on my disappointment with some of her recent books and on the early lackluster reviews. This book was back to what I expect from DMD. A good story, characters that I care about, and great recipes, particularly the chocolate chunk/tart-cherry cookies! True, her son is a bit sullen, but I don't find it to be out of character for a 16 year old boy."
5,Great buy!,This order completely met my expectations. The cd arrived on time and in the exact condition specified. I ordered this cd with a few other items and they all arrived extremely quick.
4,Better than before...,"The first album was a a lot of scream (that I personally didn't care for), or the songs just didn't make that much sense...With the exception of Disguising Mistakes with goodbyes, that was a pretty well crafted song...But I listend to Studying politics today, and that song was at least 9 times better than the others previous...The only thing I regret the most, is not seeing them in a concert when they were still a local band in my hometown..."
3,"ehh, its ok...","the first album (the weak's end) by these guys was soooo much better. mind you, this one ain't bad, but the first one was downright amazing. as a whole, they seem more, hmm, immature, somehow... the lyrics just aren't as well written, and the sound isn't as unique. I hope these guys aren't goina sell out and sound like everyone else from now on, because they really can make some beautiful songs when they put their minds to it."
5,CATCHY AND EXTREMELY FUN,"I love this album and actually think it surpasses ""TWE"". You'll have these songs stuck in your head for a long time! My favorite songs are Listening To Freddie Mercury (amazing lyrics), # 2,3,4,and 7. So buy this album."
4,emery the question,"Emery seems to be able to create music that is both interesting and catchy. Sometimes dark and explosive I find this album has found a resting place in the hearts of many. However, I must say their music can find its way to bring a listener to a rather depressed state and the lack of God in this album seems characteristic of the way tooth and nail has decided to go. The guys may very well be believers and have awesome and fruitful relationships with the Lord but it is not reflected in this cd. I think if I had a child I would recommend they listen to something else. However, I do like their music."
5,Simply Amazing,"For the longest time I was looking for the right sound of music..the one day I came across Emery. I heard the song ""walls"" then purchased both albums. but i must say ""The Question"" is by far the best cd ive ever had. I listen to it every single day. :)"
5,Better than the debut,"Now that all the scene kids have had their say, i feel compelled to tell the truth. The Question is WAY better than emery's debut ""the weaks end"". Scene kids won't admit that for fear of ""selling their favorite band out"", but i have no problem telling it like it is. The question is more focused, catchier and much more dynamic than the debut. Emery's use of dual and sometimes tripal vocal attacks is far more effective than anything found on ""the weak's end"", and the songwriting is far more mature. Emery did what all bands should, they built and got better off of an already good debut. Progression scene kids, not regression. Progression."
3,A slight let down,"This album just seems so much more...impersonal, and even as the one guy said, immature than The Weak's End. This album has some great songs but it needs more songs like ""By All Accounts (Today was a Disaster) and ""As Your Voice Fades"". I mean, this album closes with ""Just between the rock and paper the scissors cut in so much deeper. I'd take it all back to start over again"". Maybe that appeals to 13 year old girls who shop at hot topic, but I miss lines like ""If I erased the line between forgotten days and memories, I'd never change"". There are a few tracks that make this CD worthwile though. My suggestion is, if you're an Emery fan, buy this, but if you're new to Emery, buy their first."
5,A Must Read!,"Wow! This book kept me turning the pages. Mr. McGovern shares his life experiences with his readers with eloquence and style. It's well organized and yet, easy to read. The book is written from Mr. McGovern's heart as he shares his real life experiences as a career expert. Not just another business book! I'm planning on giving one to each of my friends."
4,"Fargo it's not, but fun it is.","Being a great Coen Brothers fan, I expected much of this film directed by the Coen's storyboard artist J. Todd Anderson, and written by Anderson and Ethan Coen. Let me say simply that it is not a great film. In fact, as a film, it is not even very good. Then why the four stars? I rate it highly because it has spectacular imagery, a sometimes hilarious script, and the filmakers did not set out to make a great film. They did exactly what they wanted to do. They created a often hilarious and always entertaining story of a chiropractor by day, wrestler by night who avenges the deaths of his parents by curing spinal disalignment everywhere. Cheers to Mr. Rapaport and Michael Jeter for going all out. Anderson shows some promise with a style much like John Waters. Elvis and the ""All Wrestlers Call"" are two highlights. Please enjoy and rent all Coen films if you have not previously seen them."
1,the emperor's clothes,"I watched this because I like Rapaport, but he can't save this jumbled mess of a film. A movie this ridiculous should make the most of its ridiculousness, but the laughs here are few and far between; a few clever morsels tossed into a stew of pointlessness."
4,GB home network=Oh yeah!,"This would be a full 5-star if this had a WAN port; maybe they'll consider that.......I did some amazoning for upgrading my home network from fast ethernet to Gb; not a whole lot of products out there, but literally tons of Gb desktop switches. I liked this one because of the fiber ports and stacking capability. I actually have a new wireless router that is Gb to this switch, so g/n with ""potential"" wireless speeds up to 450Mbps and wired side Gb, I can say it was a good investment upgrade for my network.UPDATE: I purchased this switch to replace an older Cisco switch I got off Ebay for some CCNA training; holy crap I didn't realize how #%*& LOUD the Cisco switch was! This new switch has not only increased my home network speed, but quieted the room as well. Very happy so far; not had to reboot switch at all"
2,Just not enough content,"Just not enough content pretty much sums it up for me. Half the book was pictures, which were supposed to emphasize the techniques, but I found many to be unappealing. The overall material explaining the author's ideas of design criteria could have been presented in about ten pages."
1,Couldn't finish this,"I started this book but I had to stop reading it. I just can't grasp how someone who went through the loss of a child could abandon her three remaining babies. And then she writes a book about it, hoping to profit from her selfishness. She makes me sick."
1,"The ""daring"" author?","She left her husband to go have casual sex with a yoga instructor? That's not daring. It's banal.She also abandoned her children. That's not a ""different kind of mother"" that's quitting as a mother.I hope that the author failed to find her true self -- otherwise she is truely an awful human being."
2,One word.....selfish,"Although I found this book interesting, the more I read, the less I liked or agreed with the choices the author made. I didn't read her first book, because as a mom myself, I guess I'm a coward, I can't read about dying children. The more I read this book, the more the author's selfishness came through. It's all about her, her choices, her this, her that. I tried not to be judgemental, she lost a child and how can that not change you? But to leave her three young children with a man she describes as emotionally abusive and in at least one incident, physically abusive, shows her consideration was not for her children but for herself. I wonder how the children will look at this when they are grown. I hope for her sake, her choices are worth the day to day loss of her children, and the possible loss of the respect of her children when they are grown."
3,Worth a read,"I found this book and thought it sounded interesting. I couldn't imagine how this mother could give up custody of her three children and leave them behind. I knew I wanted to read this book and then I saw Maria Housden had written another book Hannah's Gift prior to this one. I thought I should read that first, so I did. Hannah's gift was like a wound...but an engrossing and well written wound.When you read her story (stories) it makes sense that she gave her ex-husband custody of her children. I think she did what was in the best interest of her children. I think she was brave enough to make her decision based on what would be the best for everyone and not what everyone would think of her for it.I think if you don't judge and just listen to her story you can see that she is a very good mother. And brave enough to tell her story."
1,Worthless. Pox on professors who require it for class.,Mistakes on most every page. How could an ethical editor allow it into circulation?
3,This a good book to have on your refrence shelf,"This book gives a good view of the mechanics of cellular genetics and has been helpful in a pinch as a refresher when looking at the basics of gene regulation etc... Maybe some of the data is off but if you are looking for information related to Molecular Biology in only one refrence text, then you have more to worry about than inconsistent data, all texts have errors here and there, this book is no exception. Let's not forget that science evolves, and as we learn more about the mechanisims that regulate cellular genetics some theories and data become useless. All in all it serves its puropse well as a teaching text and as an added source of refrence materal, I would recommend it to a fellow researcher."
2,Save your money.,"Here is my revised review of this text. The material within is too ridiculously specific to be of much use to undergraduates, who need good, classic models of phenomena to understand. On the other hand, the material selection is far too hit-or-miss and general in each area to be of use to a researcher. The researcher will continue to benefit primarily from review articles, while the undergraduate will find a good biochemistry text most helpful (try Voet & Voet's section on DNA replication, repair, etc... it is excellent and can be read in a finite amount of time).Bless Ben Lewin's little heart, I don't know who the hell this book will be good for."
2,The Worst Advanced Genetics Book I've Ever Read,"Rumor has it that Oxford Press was paid by thepound for this text. The extremely large font (14pt?) is extremely annoying unless you really enjoy flipping pages. The index is the worst ever, the references are scanty, and the text is long on illustrations and short on substance. In fact, the illustrations are the only thing that save this book, which reduces many complex molecular mechanisms into simple succinct paradigms, completely heedless of accuracy. The mere mention of this book in my medical school lecture hall illicited a long series of groans and sighs. Buy it only if you absolutely have to!"
4,Lewin writes with a definitive style but lacks a little fun,As a biology student at University this is a set book.Although it contains lots of information my genetics course demands another one or two books in order to get it into my head.Lewin writes with a black and white style that can send you to sleep.Poor diagrams
2,The Worst Advanced Genetics Book I've Seen,"Rumor has it that they sell all the books in the Genes Series by the pound. The extremely large print is very distracting and makes the book very hard to lug around. The illustrations are wonderful, but many times the text is long on pretty colors and short on important details. Mr. Lewin has not referenced his text well, giving only general references some of which are less than helpful. The index was by far the worst aspect of the book--it's almost impossible to find anything. In an informal survey, 3 of 4 students in my medical school class say they would burn their copy of Genes first if they were trapped in a snowstorm and needed the heat."
1,Too simple a text,"I have found Genes VI, as well as previous editions, to be teeming with errors on almost every page. In addition, its index (as others have pointed out) is absolutely unhelpful because it is too general. In other words, one would have better luck finding a topic by flipping through the book than by utilizing the index. The format of the text seems elementary and Lewin does not go into much technical detail. Therefore, I think this book is most likely suited for an molecular biology course for non-science majors, or as supplemental reading in an upper level biology course."
4,neverending but outstanding,"Genes VI, it's excellent for those who have hours of free reading time, unfortunately I don't... anyway it's the best book on genetics. I find it extremely interesting and well written!!! I love it so I highly recomend it."
1,worst index on the planet,"This book is rife with errors, is poorly written (and verbosely so) and has the worst index of any book half its size. My only wish is that I could give it less than one star. If Ben Lewin spent more time editing his book, and less time on pretty, inaccurate figures, he might have succeeded in producing a book worth buying. As it is, it is little more than trash."
1,I'd give ZERO stars if I could...,I'm a biochemistry and this book is just a joke! It doesn't address topics with any level of clarity at all ...
2,not for students,"I'm an university student, and I have used this book for exams in Genetics, Microbiology, Cell Biology, ... well, some chapers contained information I haven't found in other books, than it was good. But in general, I found the book very difficult to understand in the material. The English of the book was also a bit complicated, with words I had to look up in big dictionaries. If you're a student and want to understand things, I don't recommend it for you."
2,Unforgivably Disorganized,"Gene VI, by Lewin exibits no organization within the chapter nor a system or flow to the material being presented. The figures are incoherently positioned throughout the text, some before the written explanation, some after, but rarely were they coordinated. The poorly marked diagrams are very difficult to decipher if one can even find them in the first place. On a positive note, the text seemed very thorough. I am too however, frightened by all of the positive reviews of this text."
5,Works great,"I have a Mackie vlz mixer and I wanted to use only one powered JBL eon speaker for lack of set-up space for a gig, worked great I was able to connect both channels into one XLR imput, a must if your a DJ and set-up space is limited. gforce2018"
3,WARNING: DO NOT ORDER TO PLAY iPod & Microphone,"I'm sure this product works for whatever purpose it is designed for(probably using 2 mics on one channel. But the reason I ordered this item is to use both an iPod and wireless microphone simultaneously for DJ events. When you have them both plugged in, the microphone will play through your speaker but the moment you activate your iPod, the iPod becomes the dominant source of sound and the wire connected to the microphone is no longer active. Another words, you can only use one device at a time and never together defeating the purpose of the splitter in this instance. A colleague of mine recommended I get a basic Microphone Mixer for this purpose which is about the same price as the wire. Just a head's up to others that were thinking of blindly spending on the same theory I had."
2,"Eh, kinda garbage","Well, first of all, there are NOT eight black-and-white Fleischer Studio cartoons on here. There are three. I don't know if I got sent the wrong tape or what, it does say Popeye Cartoons Vol. 1 but the tape I got has four or five color cartoons (...) and 3 B&W Fleischer ones. Since the only reason I bought it was for the B&W Fleischer toons I was fairly disappointed, but at $10 a pop that comes to about $3.30 per quality cartoon, so what are you gonna do? These toons are rare, I'll take what I can get."
4,Gene Autry,"DVD's in great shape, like watching at theater when westerns were westerns. Came in a collectible case so I can easily grab anyone of the three cases."
3,OK I guess,Lots of dark night scenes that are difficult to see and the story lines are very similar but yet I found myself enjoying them. The acting wasn't too bad for the era it was filmed.
2,"If you have Popeye's Greatest Hits, AVOID THIS!!!","A year ago, I got this tape at at Amazon, because I believed a review that said the tape had 8 black and white cartoons, well, I got only a few cartoons. most of them I already have on Popeye's Greatest Hits. If you looking for classic 30's Popeye, this is not the tape for you. Look eleswhere for other tapes."
1,This set has a bug for Gene Autry Entertainment on the films,"I bought the set and was happy with Amazon's usual great service, but will not support anymore releases by Timeless Media and Gene Autry Entertainment as they put a bug on ""Melody Trail"" every 15 minutes.I e-mailed Timeless and they claim piracy problems, well how about using a new anti-piracy prodcut called ""Macrovision?"" To make people who are not taping these films but spending their hard earned money have to have a product with a bug is ludicrous!"
2,Poor photo image quality,"I bought this to replace a dead Canon Powershot A70 3.2 mega P's.And guess what .. the old Canon has better quality photos. Clearer, sharper, plain better. I got this at a bargain price .. I'll give it to my wife and do some serious looking and review reading. I didn't want more mega P's I've never printed larger than 8 by 10 and 3.2 megas dealt with that OK."
4,Good camera - purchased used.,I purchased this camera used to replace my original one which was damaged when I dropped it. This used one is actually in better shape than my originakl one. Good vender.
2,Junk from a junk vendor,"I had owned two Olympus digital cameras and both were very nice in features and picture quality, but both died prematurely due to overly complex and silly mechanical features. So I decided to never buy an Olympus again. But I gave in for a gift because of the feature set, specs, and price (and it didn't have the mechanical feature). My niece opened it and Dead on Arrival! So she hands it to me: DEAD!The stupid written manual is w/o the basics, like identifying each button and LED. The CD disc has the same problems. So maybe a DOA instrument is a fluke, but a cheap, worthless manual is an IQ test: if you buy an Olympus device then the company is assuming that you are from the shallow end of the gene pool!"
1,No sound!,"You'll be very disappointed like me if you get your movies back from your children's music program, only to discover the camera didn't have sound. I suppose I should've noticed, but it was sold with comparable models which did record sound, and some quite well. There's a reason things are cheap.Picture quality is OK but it really eats batteries - very obvious difference from other Olympus & Nikon cameras of similar type."
2,i'm being kind with the rating,"I've had a 3MP camera for 3 years so when I spotted this at a local best buy and saw the features on it, I figured that the quality would be better. It is! But what they had in common was no audio with the video! The memory card would get errors and freeze on me. I charged a new set of batteries and put it into the cam just to hear it beep and say that it's low and would turn off. Then after repeatedly turning it back on, it'll show that the battery is fully charged. It does that often. It's ridiculous, frustrating and the purchase isn't worth it. The lag on this camera is appalling. It'll take minutes to process a picture and by that time you're ready to scream like a madman in public.If you're reading this, hit your back browser to another item."
2,Buggy and Awkward in Use,"The companion image editing software is disappointing, feature-wise, and has already crashed my (WinXP) system once.The camera itself seems to have buggy firmware as well, though I haven't fully invested the time to learn every nuance of its operations, so in fact it may just have a crummy user interface (as opposed to bugs)."
5,Very nice camera,"Slick camera. Very good picture quality, many options, small and light weight, very nice software that comes with the camera. Battery life is somewhat average, so stock up on some rechargeable AA's."
2,Save your money and get a better camera....,"I purchased this camera as a backup to my Olympus Ultra zoom (which I Love) for a vacation in Disney. I read the reviews but never noticed anyone complain about the lag time between focusing and actually taking the picture. It is SLOW! If you have a toddler and need to snap a quick picture, keep looking at other cameras. I missed more fantastic shots because of this lag time. I did further investigating when I got home thinking maybe it was my choice in batteries and found that out of 87 cameras reviewed it was the 2nd slowest.The picture quality is fine. It is easy to use and extremely small but it eats batteries. I can go a full day in Disney with my ultra zoon and I had to change my FE-210 batteries twice to keep up with my other camera.My recommendation is to save your money and get a better Olympus!"
1,piece of junk,"Even with lights turned on in the house AND flash..the photos come out dark and very ""noisy"" or pixelated...even while shooting on the highest quality. I thought I could trust a brand like Olympus but I'm sooo unhappy with this camera. I hate it; I suggest you save your money and get something else."
1,Manufacturer needs better disclosure!,"This camera was brought to replace a Sony 3.1 mega-pixel. This camera is horrible and has the nerve to display a ""movie recorder"" as one of it's ""features"" but has NO SOUND! What a waste of money. Get something better."
3,text book... need I say more,"good sleeping material... not bad content, but i'd rather read somethign INTERESTING!!!!"
4,Organizational Behavior book review,"This text was very useful to understand the concepts of Human Resource and other management functions, and the roles they play in an organization. The text was easy to follow, and was in a easy to understand chronology. The chapters were all well interrelated, carrying common themes throughout each unit. The figures and tables were also fundamental to the understanding of the concepts. They were well drawn and thought out, giving the reader a more clear picture on the material. Overall, I thought that this text book was esay to understand and provided useful, applicable information to the reader. I recommend it to other professors."
1,Have not received the book yet.,I have not received the book yet to write a review. The product has been shipped more than 4 weeks ago.Once I receive it I would write a review.
1,TERRIBLE SHAMPOO,"I have a super sensitive scalp, and have tried many shampoos to help with my constantly dry, itchy red scalp. This shampoo smelled like fresh roses but stung like a thorn! It left my scalp more dry. I will not repurchase. If you have a normal scalp, it will work for you. It is a basic, cleansing shampoo, nothing fancy."
2,Why so dark?,"I am dissatisfied with this DVD because all the scene was photographed in a dark room, only with spotlightings. Therefore those details of the body (the shadowy parts, you know) couldn't be seen clearly, though not hidden beneath lycra and tights."
2,disappointing,"Hugely disappointed by this item. The picture quality is quite grainy, the lighting terrible, and in terms of ""full nudity""... hardly. Anything you want to see if obscured by shadow much of the time.The best part of the DVD? The previews of other DVDs from this company at the end!"
2,Failed opportunity,"Greenwood filmed true athletes doing gymnastics. But the lighting is so ""creative"" that it fails to present the men anywhere near the excellence their perfect bodies deserves. It is like trying to workout nude in the dark."
2,"Little skin, poor lightng","Earlier I had seem a clip from this movie showing two gymnasts doing a floor routine nude. The clip was beautiful showing the muscular movements. I made the assumption that the rest of the movie would be the same...wrong. The 5+minute clip was the best out of the whole movie. Much is done clothed and what is nude, the lighting is so poor that the performance is hardly worth watching. The concept of the movie is wonderful, delivery is poor at best. Nice to add to my collection, but really I feel I wasted my money."
4,Good Value!,This boxset dose have it's share of heavy weights to super heavy weights. Dose have some big name MMA fights (not a lot) I have seen KOTC put on better fights than UFC dose with bigger names fighters
3,not my favorite chi product.,"I have used Chi products (along with many other brands) for years, and I had never tried the Thermal Polishing Spray, so I decided to give it a try. It's an OK product, but it's definitely not at the top of my list. If you use too much, it makes your hair look VERY oily/greasy, so use sparingly. Normally you would use a thermal spray or heat protectant liberally so I don't think that this product is the greatest to use as a heat protectant, but it is a good styling product. It tames frizz and does make your hair shine if you use a small amount. Overall I rated it 3 stars because I prefer other products that make my hair look and feel healthier while protecting them (better) at the same time."
2,Ok...but clogged!,"I own this product and it was working great, a little greasy if you sprayed too much, but after a month of having it, it has clogged and nothing comes out. I tried pulling off the top and rinsing it out and cleaning the tube but nothing worked. What a waste."
4,Beautiful Shine!!,I love this product. I first started using it when my hair dresser used it on my hair. I love the shine it gives.
5,IT's really Awesome :),"um well, like everyone says, if you put too much on, it's going to appear greasy :P But, except for that, it's pretty alsome, I mean when i have a bad hair day or if my hair isn't looking rite, it's DEFINETLY going to fix it somehow!! <3 So basically it protects your hair very well and it smells aweesome. :)"
1,Smells like cheap men's cologne,"Horrible. This product is WAY too strongly fragranced. After just a couple of sprays, I could barely breathe. Same with the several other products I bought from this line. I ended up giving them all away to a friend. CHI Shine Infusion Thermal Polishing Spray 5.3 oz"
2,I don't like it,"It wasn't what I expect, in this time of computer a book, specially a textbook should be more details and in colors etc."
5,dio sounding,"This cd was fantasic it reminds me of ronnie james dio and his music .Great guitar work ,great writting and great songs.Simply put if your a ronnie james dio fan buy this cd you wont be dissapointed. I hope this review was helpfull to you."
4,rewards,"I found this book an intriging mix of confusion and satisfaction. There were long stretches where I was utterly confused about what was going on or why the author was telling me such things interspersed with really beautiful descriptions or some other really satisfying passage that was truly enjoyable.Do I recommend this book? Sure. Just remember that the disjointed feeling is intentional. If that sort of thing does not put you off, then you will enjoy this book for the hidden treasures it contains.I can also say that despite the fact that Maria ""sleeps around"" quite a bit, it was not sexually explicit. I appreciated this. I get so sick of reading books that boldly refuse to leave any of the details to the imagination (or not as the reader chooses)."
1,Twisted like candy thinking above the rainbow's shadow,"The Author's concept of this odd book had to come from the seam of her eye where the mist and the rocks blow together like the brussel spouts of yesterday's backyard tire swing. If you liked this review, you'll love the book."
2,STRANGE,The story line could be really interesting but the style of writing is hard to take. It reads more like a poem than a novel. The story itself is all over the place. The time and place are different in every chapter. It's very fragmented. I won't be reading anything else by this author.
3,PC Upgrade & Repair Bible review,I had a gift coupon and wanted this book plus price was right. Had I stopped and realized I should have purchased a newer version and this version was printed in 2004 & while the book does have lots good tips & information in it the technology listed is & will become obsolete. So I would recommend any buyer to purchase the newest one available. I give it a 3star rating I would have gone to 4 or 5 but again most of the book is referring to outdated technology.
3,Book PC Upgrade and repair bible,"This wasn't the book that we thought it was. Nowhere does it talk about Windows XP, which is the system that use on all our computers except one that has Vista on it. We have kept the book in case we come up on a computer that this book will help. It doesn't help us out in the least."
2,THIS BOOK SHOULD BE RENAMED,"This book should has little to do with repairing computers. If you want to know how a monitor works, how to take a digital image, or set up a computer surveillance system it does a good job of expaining this and how the stuff inside the computer works. If you've been around computers a while you probably will know a lot of this.The book has 20 pages on diagnosing and repairing computers and 25 pages on building one; this is explained very vaguely.If it didn't cost so much to ship it back, I would return it."
2,Just the basics,"This book describes just the overall basics.If you want to know things like:1 - the difference between the various processors (Intel Prescott Vs AMD Sempron)2 - RAID 5 needs at least 3 hard disks to work3 - Differences between various chipsets for motherboards and video cards4 - ATA Vs SATA (hard disk controllers)5 - the technology behind all the devicesThen buy another book. This one is just for people starting to look at PC's for the first time - It has nothing to do wit a hardware ""bible"" - it's just an introduction.If you want a real book about all this stuff buy ""Upgrading and repairing PC's"" by Scott Mueller."
4,"Good, especially Joe Keenan story","Like the other books in the Men on Men series, this isan enjoyable collection of stories by and for gay men.This book stands out from the others in that it has astory by the incredible Joe Keenan (with the same maincharacters as Blue Heaven and Puttin' On The Ritz). It'sworth buying for that story alone."
4,A good overview of the T.V. pilot,"Although the T.V. show was not very popular, it had a loyal following. This book was one of the few media tie-ins done. J.M. Dillard is a capable writer, and does a good job of laying out the premise of the show and introducing the characters. It's a shame that the show has been largely forgotten. If you find a copy, it is worth a look."
2,Director & Editor Fail,"The movie has the most supurb beginning in shots of the swamp, the story told, and the wonderful score; but it goes downhill fast. The kick in the pants for the late preacher ruined a funny situation (less is more); the chasing around in the bedroom was so way over done (it became tedious); the three vulgar guys outside the bedroom door was nothing but bad taste; the anger of James Earl Jones was so much more than what was called for; the anger of the married woman who wanted to shoot her husband for being with someone else became tiresome also; and vomiting on the wedding cake was just slapstick in a movie that could have had something to say."
1,Hideous and boring!,"This movie was terrible!!!!! I love James Earl Jones but I'm sorry, it was down-right terrible. I threw it in the trash after torturing myself watching it. Don't waste your money!!!!! It's awful!"
5,Buy this book and be Winner every time,"This book is just mind-blowing. Stan Holtzman really did a great job. With stunning graphics, smooth transitions from page to page, and the feeling of really winning. Even before you open the book, You're Winner. At every page, You're Winner. It really is revolutionary.And everything in the book looks so real, like you can just rev up a Big Rig of your own to infinite speeds and drive straight through bridges and homes, and after a completely nonfunctioning race challenge you can take a stroll up a 90 degree cliff, and then cruise through the psychadelic reality-bending purgatorial void while going 999,999,999,999,999 km/h and then stop on a dime! Told you it was revolutionary.You're Winner!"
3,"Good, Pictures, Good, but repeditive",Ive had this book for a while and ive read it about 1000 times. its a very nice book but im kind of tired of it after a while because its my only truck book
5,"FIERCE, FIERCE, FIERCE",The Hard Mix is unbeatable! It will have you moving for hours - as well as the crowd you are playing to. I don't think I am going to be retiring this mix anytime soon. Buy it!
5,His best birthday present ever!,My husband listens to Sirius as much as he can...he is a NASCAR fan.He loves the boombox...I love the plug it has for headphones ;^)
5,boom box,Great boombox for sirius. just what i was looking for. great service and fast delivery luck to find one since they are no longer produced
5,Sirius Universal Plug 'n' Play boombox,"I bought this for my Husband he just loves it great buy, as I shopped around and Amazon was the best deal.Thank you Amazon"
4,Take This Siriusly,GREAT sound. Uncomparable convenience. So glad I bought this accessory for my portable Sirius receiver!
4,Sirius Boombox,I purchased a reconditioned boombox at great price. I've used it with no problems. I would recommend this product new or reconditioned.
4,"Great unit, but no remote!","I recently purchashed a Sub-X1 to replace my Orbiter boombox and Orb reciver. It sounds great. The only technical problem I have with it,is due to my location.(no real clear view of the sky). But I am disapointed that it didn't come with a remote control. My old Orbiter was ideal because of the remote feature. Being a lazy sort of guy, It was nice not to have to get up to change channels or turn the unit on or off.So may I offer a sugestion to Sirius. Make a universal remote for yourrecivers and boomboxes."
4,A great product if it works for you,"Reception-wise, it's hit or miss with this product, possibly depending on the area you live in. In my house, even in the basement, I get great reception without even moving the antenna from its mount on the boombox itself. At work though I had to carefully position it at a window to get decent reception (involving connecting a 50 foot antenna extension cord to it). Make sure you pay attention to the part of the instruction manual that says what way to point the antenna- I found it made a big difference at my office.The sound quality is excellent. An equalizer would've been nice but it's really overall a pretty good stereo in spite of that."
3,It all depends on where you try to use it! No Signal=No Music,The boombox itself is great and has worked awesome everytime I have a good signal. The problem will always be the availability of a good signal.
2,only certain locations,"I had intended to use the boombox at work. I originially did not know about the need for the indoor/outdoor antenna, which of course makes sense in order to receive a satelite signal, but there is NO physical way for me to get the anntenna outside and I don't have a window in my office. I even tried the boombox at home with the antenna on the windowsill, and I still couldn't get a signal. So disappointed! The boombox is a great design, light weight, and great sound (when I could get a signal for 2 sec.), but unless you have just the right place to put it or are able to put the antenna outside, you may have limited signal capability. So sad! I love my satelite radio!"
3,"Nice to have, but...","...it is just a box with an on and off switch and volume control. There is no ability to adjust the bass/treble/etc. And I think it's a little too bass.It's a nice looking unit and I enjoy having Sirius radio in the house. It has a jack, so you can plug your iPod or computer into it to listen to another source."
3,An Okay Mystery,"This is a fairly good mystery, the characters are interesting, Christie tries to keep you guessing, but the bottom line is, that this mystery is just not as good as her others. Although there are some interesting twists towards the end, the murderer's identity does not seem that surprising, and some details (one in particular) just seem sort of tacked on. This causes one to feel somewhat unsatisfied with the ending. Still, it was enjoyable for a light read, and it has some worthwhile aspects. One of the interesting things about this mystery is that it does not involve any of her usual detectives (Poirot, Miss Marple, Parker Pyne -- any others? I'm a hard core Poirot fan myself). You might try to find at your local library before you buy it, however, since you probably won't want to read it again."
4,"Local color, perplexing characters, plot twist","Ordeal by Innocence does have that totally unexpected plot twist that, paradoxically, readers expect from Agatha Christie! Holding the reader with an exploration of different psyches and some British local color, she immerses the reader in the situation. Several war orphans, all in the same situation during the war, react each so differently to the people they lived with. Ordeal by Innocence is one of Christie's better character studies."
5,good lock for good price,"I bought this lock after my last bike got stolen. I also bought the Kryptonite Kryptolok Series 2 Standard Bicycle U-Lock (4-inch x 9-inch) with 4-Foot Flex Cable to have two locks at night.I use this one only as a second lock, because it is too small of course to lock my bike to something. So I use it to lock my rear wheel and I lock the bike with the other one to something. I use the cable to lock my front wheel and also to lock it to something.I know, that this is really much, but my lock before was also not too bad and didn't work.Now my neighbors are laughing and tell me that I will always keep the bike like this :)During the day I only use the bigger one to lock my front wheel and the frame to something.In total this is a really good lock for this price! I would buy it again! And I still have my bike, although I leave it outside at night."
4,Solid product,"Have used this product for a couple years now. It's been outside in the elements continuously and while other parts of my bike have rusted its key mechanism is working great. The cable on the other hand has had some water get under the plastic coating is starting to rust. No indicators that it is any less strong, but I am a little surprised water got in."
3,Seems quite secure,"The lock seems pretty secure, but it can sometimes be a little hard to turn the key when locking it. It seems like the U portion of it doesn't quite go in all the way. I also found that OnGuard's anti-theft protection isn't automatic or free (you have to download a form from their website and send it it with payment to get the anti-theft protection) Plus, they don't tell you this on the packaging. The anti-theft protection also doesn't cover anything if it is broken with the aid of a drill or other electric device."
2,The plastic mounting bracket broke on installation...,"The lock itself seems like it is good quality. However, I never had a chance to use the lock since, the plastic lock bracket, which mounts the lock to the bike broke on installation. As a result, I cannot take the lock with me when I go biking.The bracket installation guide does not effectively show how to mount the bracket properly to the bike. Even after carefully following the installation instructions, the bracket kept sliding & eventually one of the plastic pieces broke.Unfortunately, I purchased the lock in May 2008 on Amazaon and I didn't get around to installing the lock until July 2008, which is beyond the 30 day return policy, so I cannot return the lock."
3,Great except for the bike connector,"I bought this and works great, when locked but the key gets stuck when removing it as well the device that attaches to the bike does not feel well built and in truth is not. My u-lock twice fell of the bike while riding it and now it wont lock in place on the bike attachment. If you are a commuter you are better off just putting it in one of your panniers or leave it at work. But I due feel the u-lock as a whole is a very good lock and will prevent my bike from being stolen. I use Sheldon Brown's locking method."
2,My bike was stolen using this lock,"My brand new Gary Fisher Hybrid was stolen from the Metra train station on the north side of Chicago using this lock. I was locked to a bike rack with many other bikes at 6:30am. By 2:30 my bike and lock were gone. The thief must have cut or leveraged the lock open. This is a low crime, high traffic area, so I doubt the thief would have had time to make it a long project to get open - seems the lock was easy to get open. Just an FYI for those thinking about this lock in a big city. Also, the warranty is useless if the thief takes the bike and lock together. If your bike is stolen, you gotta hope the lock is left behind :("
3,too short for my taste,"keep in mind you pretty much have to use the cable/u-lock in combination. the u-lock is only long enough to fit btw the rear tire and the frame. the cable will have to secure the bike to whatever object to which you want to lock it. and, i find the cable a little short to easily pass around the front wheel and the object you are locking to."
4,Solid and Durable,"My wife and I have used this lock for the past 2 years in Chicago and have found it to be durable and a perfect size. It small so usually we're not able lock up both the front wheel and frame but so far it has been a fine deterrent against theft locked up to the frame alone. The first thing I did when putting the bikes together was remove all of the quick release, so we decided that the cable wasn't needed and haven't carried it at all. The cable also comes with a velcro attachment that sorta works but can jiggle loose easily while riding, which was also a reason to stop bringing it along."
4,Very good bike lock,"I have not experienced any of the problems described in other reviews. The lock is easy to close with the key. The bracket has worked very well in attaching the lock to my bike. Only problem I had was that I lost the security cable because there is not good way to attach it to the lock or the bike. The velcro piece does not work well. Overall I am very pleased with the purchase, and I have used this lock now for several months."
4,Make sure you note that it's a mini.,"The Mini OnGuard Bulldog and security cable is a portable solution for the sequrity of your bike. The extra cable really helps in the effort to lock the bike. Sometimes for my road bike I wish I would have a longer extra cable, since the rail I'm attaching it to is not always very close, but I guess you need a non-Mini version for that. I originally bought this combo for my mountain bike and have no problems in locking the frame with the U-Lock and the wheels with the extra security cable (but not the wheel and the frame and the rail only using the U-Lock part which is possible with the non-Mini version). The U-Lock and and the cable could be fit in a normal size student backpack or can be attached with the mechanism provided to the frame of your bike and it won't fall off even if you sometimes go off the curb.Security rating of this thing as rated on some sites is pretty high, as some websites that tested it vs. other similar products."
4,good lock short cable,"The lock works great! Easy to lock and unlock, but the cable that comes with is a little short. I ride to work, and the rack they have is not fully visible to the public. So I was hoping this would be the one sollution for locking my bike. I managed to get the cable all around the bike and use the U-lock at the back tire to connect it all, but I have no extra to connect to the rack. Maybe if I had gotten a bigger U-lock I could connect there? Any ways we purchased a cheap cable lock to connect to the rack also."
1,The Security Cable is Cuttable,"This lock works fine and all, but I had a bike stolen because someone just cut through the security cable.So, if you're using it then you might as well throw the security cable out and just use the U-Lock."
1,Weak cable,I chained the bike for only one hour at 10 am on Park Ave in Manhattan. The cable was cut and my bike was stolen.
3,Ongard Bike Lock,Good bike lock. I live in the suburbs so crime is not too bad. If I lived in a big city I might consider a better lock. Lock is made in China. Quality is just okay.
3,Don't buy this for the coverage!!!,"I was looking at a Kryptonite Evo Mini-7 W/Brkt 3.25 X 7-Inch with 4-feet Flex Lock and this lock. I bought this based on at the time the description said it had a $1,500 warranty and this lock was half the price of the Kryptonic which had a $2,000 plan. Since my bike was about $1,500 I figured the OnGurad would work. Well what it didn't say was they "" offer"" a warranty which you have to buy yearly ( $15 for 3 years) Had I known this I would have gone with the Kryptonic. I blame the seller who has changed the site and the company for not making it clear. ( I had to even call the OnGuard company to make it clear) And they don't cover the cable, just the lock, even though it's sold as a set. In the end you get what you pay for."
3,"Take ""mini"" literally","I recently purchased the Bulldog Mini lock. I've been using it for a few weeks.The good: So far, no key jams or other malfunctions.The annoying: The size. For urban street biking, the U of the lock is barely large enough to surround the wheel, mainframe and anchor poll. This is the only way one should secure their bike, so it's very important to me for the lock to be big enough.In the coming months, I will most likely purchase a larger U lock so I won't have to worry whether my lock will be big enough to properly secure my bike."
2,Don't Buy This,"I bought this item for my freshmen year at college. It broke in about a month. The key got jammed TWICE! The first time I was able to dislodge it, and just had to use a new key, but the second time I wasn't able to get it out, and a maintenance crew member ended up breaking my key in half! This product is cheap. Pass it up."
3,Dimensions not as specified,"This lock is a quality lock with great keys. It's hefty, sturdy, and looks like it will last quite a while.But be aware that the dimensions indicated here (""Product Dimensions: 9 x 8 x 3.3 inches"") are not correct. The actual packaging with the product says: 3.55 in. x 5.52 in., or 90mm x 240mm. This is smaller than half the advertised size. I'm not saying the lock is bad. Just be aware that what you're getting may not physically fit what is needed in your situation."
4,"Nice lock, but it's not the one in the picture","The image shown with this product is actually OnGuard's ""Pitbull Mini,"" which is a step up from the ""Bulldog Mini"" on offer here. The true ""Bulldog Mini,"" which is what you'll get if you order this product, is black and yellow rather than black and chrome -- look for it in the ""other products you might like"" sections of this page."
3,Thief cut through with basic small wire cutter,"I've been using this system for a few years and last night a thief successively (and apparently easily) cut through the cable, which attached the bike to the wall with an anchor, with a small pair of wire cutters. Thankfully, the security staff in my building caught the guy before he got away and had him arrested. This isn't a bad product, but you should remember that this, like any other lock system, is merely a deterrent. In this case the thief passed up unlocked (!) bikes for mine, which he seemed to know what pretty valuable. While I wouldn't stop recommending the product I will start reminding everyone that this won't fully stop a determined criminal."
5,xmas gift,"Bought this for my 1 yr old granddaughter as one of her xmas presents. Our local library has this owl in the kid's section and every time she is there she walks around carrying it. It isn't xmas yet, but I know she's going to love it."
4,Fun,It is like an old fashinoned toy and lots of fun for our grandson to pull around. He is really enjoying it
3,I don't know why this little guy is so popular - kinda boring,"My toddler really never grew to be that interested with the alligator (other than trying to scare Mommy with him - ha) - at least not as a walking toy. He does make a cool clacking sound when you pull him - but I don't know...not sure why he seems so popular. We did have fun taking our Learning Resources Gingerbread snap toys and placing them in each of the openings on the alligator's back - and that's really all my 2 year old uses him for. We've had him for a year and I've tried to get her engaged in pulling him around. The colors are bright and he seems very sturdy... I just don't think the toy is worth the price. That said, I only have one child (so far) - so maybe it's just a matter of my baby not being into pull toys. She much preferred walking around using a helium balloon to have the similar effect as a pull toy - so go figure! :)"
5,Chomp chomp fun,This toy has gotten more and more fun as our daughter went from being a walker to a runner. She can pull it behind her from room and room and the noise makes her feel really accomplished. She also now makes a chomp chomp noise with the alligator mouth and tries to feed him. I love that it is wood.
1,Choking Hazard!,"My 19-month-old received the dancing alligator as a Christmas gift and absolutely loved it until a small wooden dowel on the side of the face popped out. I found her playing with it, and thankfully got it from her.I don't understand why a toy rated for children under two would have chokable pieces that pop out easily, especially for what I paid. I recommend the Melissa and Doug frolicking frog. All of the pieces are attached together by thick string.The alligator is just plain dangerous in my opinion."
4,Very cute,"My one year old loves this toy. He really gets a kick out of seeing the way it moves, and it didn't take him long to figure out how to reel it in (he's not walking yet). It works best on a hard floor; it doesn't ripple as well on carpet, but it's fun either way."
5,Amazing Allie Alligator!,"We purchased this toy for our grand-daughter for her 1st birthday. Her parents were intrigued with the sounds and soon Allie became a favorite. My grand-daughter experiments with how many places Allie can fit into and untangles his string easily herself. Just the right length, funny sounds, interesting movements and easy to manipulate, this toy is an outstanding selection for your toddler!"
5,LOVE this!,"My 10 month old LOVES this toy!! He is not walking yet, but loves to pull the string and shake the alligator to make it make noise. He plays with it all the time! Great durable and very cute toy!"
4,it's neat,"this toy is pretty neat. it makes cool wood-on-wood clickity-clackity sounds. the little girl i bought it for (1 year old) seems to really like it. no educational value, but so what.the craftsmanship is nice, and the parents seemed to love it.i'll probably buy this or something similar for my baby when he starts trying to walk."
5,Great toy for a new walker,Although my 14 month grand daughter push'es it more than pulls it she seem's to like the movements and clicking and clacking noise that it makes.
4,Gator pull toy,"Daughter loves it. Only downside is she broke it after only a few months. It was on a bookcase, she was trying to reach it, it fell off bookcase and our hard wood floors and the back wheel dowel broke in half, so it was minus one wheel. She still played with it with only 3 wheels, it was just a little louder then. 6 months later, the other back wheel broke off so it was down to 2 wheels. She still plays with it! So only 4 stars because it can break."
4,great toy for 9month and above,"We purchased this Dancing Alligator from Plan Toys and really impressed by its quality. It came exactly like in the picture, I mean color wise, shape, and look, etc. My daughter was 9 month when she got it. Since it was a new toy she liked to play with it, and quickly figured out she needs to pull it. I think it helps her develop her sense of using her fingers or hands and eyes coordinately ( motor skills basically). Well, like every other toy in the house, her interest is always diverted to new things that she finds. She still plays with it once a while, but we think it is a toy that she could still enjoy when she's 2 or 3.I would have given it a full-star if the paint of one wood chip of alligator's body didn't come off. But again, we know how a 9 or 10 month old plays with a toy like this. After smacking or banging it on the floor a few times, it is not a BIG surprise for me to see it. :)"
4,Gr8 Time waister toy,My Grandson loves it..Its Durrible...not too too noisy..and he loves pulling it around..the first week he had it u couldnt get him away from it!! He still loves it.but its made its way into the rotation of trucks and things. Hes 2 btw... I think he'll b playing with this for a while. I wish i had got it when he was younger tho. Oh well..its good now too
3,cool toy,but not to take outside. it will get dirty immediately and it will not come off when i'll try to clean it. play at home will work out. alligatorlooks funny and seems to be a good size for my 16mo.old (i mean dosnt look too small or oversized).
5,Great companion,"Our son walked a little on the late side at 17 months, and this little alligator has become a great companion for him since. With a dog, we must go for walks daily, and he walks the alligator while I tend to his younger brother and walk the dog. That alligator has put some MILES on it. We got it as a gift from my aunt who is an avid Salvation Army shopper and were devastated when a wheel fell off (this is probably after at least 50 miles on the thing, not including its milage from previous owners), but we found a label on its clackity body and were ecstatic to have located a new one. The best part ... no batteries! Just a well-made and inexpensive toy that is, quite literally, willing to go the distance with your little one."
1,Not useful,"Not useful or of good quality-easily replaced by sandpaper and chisel. Small buys add up-just save pennies, buy a leather-man."
4,Spiffer is Spiffy,"This is a good product as it is a replacement for one I had that walked away in someone else's hands. If it wasn't good, I obviously wouldn't have replaced it. The only difference was that this one had a 'keychain' on it ~ that I immediately removed. For one, the chain got in the way of one of the functions and second, I like that it is so skinny b/c it fits in my wallet and I can still close my wallet. Having a skinny pen in the wallet is great and the fact that it is also a nail file, etc. is a nice bonus. I actually bought 2, just in case someone 'borrows' my pen again and it disappears."
3,great idea,"This is a really great idea. this thing is perfect to have in your purse or wallet for when you break a nail at work. the file strip is narrow and short, but it is perfect for emergencies so you aren't walking around with a craggy nail all day. the emery isn't course though, so I have worn my strip out in a few months. I don't think the cuticle pusher is great, who wants to try and push up a dry cuticle at work anyway? The nail cleaner is perfect. As I said, this is a great item to keep in your wallet for emergency nail repair. I doubt it was designed for some tween kids to play ""nail salon"" with on a saturday night, but as a WORKING PROFESSIONAL woman, I think they are SPIFFY!"
2,Inexpensive little item,I needed an item to make my total $25. This is a inexpensive item. The file is tiny and would only be good in a pinch.
1,not worth it,"we bought this as a cheap/easy stocking stuffer. It's simply not woth anything. The little file is a good idea, but too tiny to actually work. My daughter (8yrs old) liked the idea too, but was sad that she couldn't work with the tiny strip that's too short for even her little fingers. Cute, but not worth it."
4,refreshing,"As a massage therapist I found this ""dance"" both refreshing and extremely hopeful for a longer career without wearing out our precious hands.Just a pity that Val doesn't run any training courses here in Europe!Congratulations on a wonderful compilation!"
4,The best joke source,"Even if you are not having fun with your mates in a pub but just sitting in your couch alone, this book can guarantee you to have a good time.For it contains more than 1000 jokes, you will be sure to find jokes that suit your taste.Have to prepare a speech and want to find something interesting to warm up the audience? This is a smart buy."
5,Marion Zimmer Bradley's Darkover (Darkover anthology),"She truely was one of the greatest sci fantasy writers of all time. Sometimes I come back to this between novels. This anthology fills in several gaps explained in the novels, but sometimes one wants to read the little story in between. Often I could see as if actors played a part, like Dyan Ardais (Ralph Fiennes) and Rafael Hastuer (Johnny Depp) and Danilo Syrtis (Ioan Gruffudd) . The ladies get to be real people too, it is a fun read."
1,Tiny little pillow - misleading advertisement,"Although buckwheat pillows are great and the best for me, I am extremely disappointed with this purchase. I bought two to replace a Sobakowa pillow I bought years ago. Although the box clearly states ""Fits standard size cases"" this pillow is TINY. A third of the size of a standard pillow. The ads fail to mention the insufficient dimensions. My original pillw was a normal standard size. These pillows are travel size at best. Basically a rip-off and false advertising and not enough loft to deliver the benefits. Look elsewhere for a better and normal size pillow!"
4,"Small, but comfy","I was introduced to buckwheat-husk pillows when they were a popular mini-fad, and I haven't been able to sleep comfortably on anything since. This makes travel difficult. This little pillow makes things much easier for me."
2,It's Okay,"I suppose if your neck is not always in knots this is a great pillow. Also, I was thinking this would be a bigger pillow. I can't say anything bad about the pillow, but I need an extra something. I am still looking for that perfect pillow."
2,Max Brennan's 1300 Milliseconds of Brass,"This, as a whole is not really my cuppa tea.However, I bought the album to get my hands on the last track of CD1 - Max Brennan's 1300 Milliseconds of Brass. This is a superb tune, and one that deserves to be part of a much more interesting and experimental compilation. The tune uses fantastic synthetic beats, great jazz-style keyboards, awsome bass lines, and when the second half kicks in...The mind-blowing Brass!!!!"
2,"ok, but....","Denny was a kind soul. His words of wisdom were great and many. BE KIND! However, when I read this book I was shocked. His references to pedophilia and whatnot appalled me. I truly expected much more from Denny. He was always so good at doing the lead-ins to weather on channel 10 wdio duluth channel 13 wirt iron range television. Denny could have done much better with his memoirs. He took a turn south afterwards."
4,Wonderful blend of voices,This is an unknown group that was recommended to me. This blend of good male voices is a joy to hear.
2,Today's vocabulary word: Didactic,"""Inclined to teach or moralize excessively""This book wasn't about characters. Good writing consists of good characters doing interesting things. This book holds the issue of abortion at its center, along with the issue of cloning. The writing was cliche, characters undeveloped and the plot was weak and predictable. Agree with the other reader, Harlequin romance novel minus the juicy sex scenes disguised as thought provoking literature. Not my cup of tea..."
2,Interesting plot,"It's too bad the writing couldn't back it up. Wow...He could have taken this to the limit and ended up with a really great book. He didn't. Instead, he got lazy with it. I felt there was no real character development and the entire storyline came across as simple. You were not pulled into these people's lives at all. I had no desire to learn anything more about who they were or where they came from.I pulled this off the shelf hoping for a book that would not only entertain me but would also make me really think about my thoughts and positions on a not too unrealistic possiblity...taking a deep look into various viewpoints of a current topic. What I got was a Harlequin level romance which ended up turning into a fairytale. No, thanks. If I want a good fairytale, I'll stick with the brothers Grimm.I save 1 star ratings for items that deserve a zero. This one gets 2 from me merely for the promising storyline. I hope someday, someone will take the idea and really run with it."
1,Irreparable Harm,There is no way I can review this book because I have never received it. My order waas placed 10/12/09 Please reimburse my account $4.99. Order # 103=7161381-6842641 Until now I have been fully satisfied with Amazon. William Montie
4,Just as good as the first,"If youve seen the first movie then you know what to expect.i havent seen the second but after seeing the first and third i really want to.the maniac cop is way more ruthless in this one and some of the kills are acually funny(spoiler)...like the one where he picked up a guy,threw him in the air and shot him six times before his body hit the floor...thats just pure fun to watch.considering how cheap you can get this one i dont see how people shouldnt get this one and the first.willian lustig deliverd another wonderful horror movie with a script by larry cohen.give this movie a chance and i know youll like it alot just like i did.the end leaves room for a forth maniac cop and i hope one day theyll do one."
3,This more of an Slasher film than an thriller but Still Fun.,"Most thought the murderer cop (Robert D`Zar) is dead but he has been brought back to life by a voodoo man. Now the cop only wants one thing, an woman is his life.This silly premise works because of Larry Cohen (Phone Booth) Script. Directed by the same director:William Lustig (Maniac Cop 1 & 2, Uncle Sam). The Last in the Series. Watch for actors:Robert Forster (Jackie Brown) & Paul Gleason (The Breakfest Club). Grade:B-."
1,An attempt to create a new Freddy or Jason?,"Fat chance if any further (unlikely) Maniac Cop sequels are going to be like this. The interest has gone from the series.The plot, such as it as, revolves around that uniformed cadaver Matt Cordell being resurrected once again. He then attempts to bring about the resurrection of the female cop killed in Part 2, for reasons which never become apparent.Boring and lifeless from beginning to end, new ideas very thin on the ground indeed. Virtualy nothing seems to happen throughout the bulk of the film, and it ends in yet another car chase. Don't bother with this one. We don't want the producers thinking it's popular enough to warrant dragging the series to any further depths with a Part 4."
4,Officer Matthew Cordell finally put to rest. R.I.P.,"Well, starting from the end of Part 2. Cordell is finally at rest, although flashbacks from Part 2 become to apparent in the opening credits. A voodoo master of the occult is resureccting Cordell. Basically this has nothing to do with revenge its good if you like Cordell. He actually speaks in this one compared to being Silent in Pt. 1. Part 2. He gasped his name although he was still human kind of. Now he is more burnt. I like Robert Z'Dar but I wish they would have kept his original make up and uniform. I didnt like the leather because it didnt give him to much arm movement."
3,Just not a great live album,"Live from Toronto is the only live everclear album. But as live albums go, this one is just plain bad.Except for some crowd noise at the beginning and end of the tracks, each song sounds just about like studio version. Even the guitar solos are [bad], uninspired, and pretty much sound like the studio version as well. Nor is there any dialogue. Art says ""hey this is the next single off our album,"" and ""goodnight"" at the end. That's it. In other words, unless you're just a die hard everclear fan, I wouldn't recommend live from toronto - this album doesn't offer anything new on everclear."
5,Historically significant and entertaining!,This is actual black and white footage of the recording and interviews with the principles. Many argue that these recordings were and are the greatest ever of this cycle.This is the equivilant of footage of The Beatles working on Sgt Peppers or Elvis in the Sun Studios laying down his first sessions...How often are we allowed to see the process of the creation of a masterpiece?I feel very lucky that this is available...what are you waiting for?
1,Not Shocking - not gruesome - not violent - a lot of hype over nothing,"This review is the from the Criterion Edition.Spoiler Alert for horror fans! You watch this expecting a horror film you have spoiled two hours of your life.This is not a horror film. It is not shocking in any sense. There was blood twice and even then it looked fake in the leg scene. If your expectations are a artsy film this may be for you. If you are looking for the promised horror it markets then ugh... Go watch Martyrs. It is still the vanguard for horror brutality and yet retains than 'artsy' feel. (August Underground, Scrapbook, Murder Set Pieces all fall into a different category).I will say the film is beautifully shot and the dialogue is interesting but its just so freaking boring. Between this and Let the Right One in you have the perfect cure for insomnia."
4,SHOCKING BUT INPRESSIVE,"VON TRIER NEVER THHINKS THINGS IN ORDINARY WAYS. I DON'T FEEL TOO SHOCKING ABOUT ANTICHRIST. HOWEVER, IT'S REALLY HARD TO UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE PLOT. WHY DID CRITERION CHOOSE IT RIGHT AWAY?"
1,Completely depraved,"The worst, most depraved, movie I have ever seen. There was NOTHING redeeming about it whatsoever. A dead child, an abusive mother, a lunatic husband -- mix in mindless sex, genital mutilation, blood and gore... Awful. I felt like I needed a shower and a walk in the fresh air just to clean the stench of this film off from me. Not a fan."
3,Interestingly Unusual,"I was torn about this film. I didn't like it as much as I thought I would. There were way too many symbolisims which I'm sure stood for something, I'm just not sure what. I was confused, intregued, surprised, sometimes bored but overall, it was ok. I usually enjoy a freaky movie but this one simply wasn't my taste."
3,Slightly boring,"This movie was hailed as very controversial, but actually it's only the title which is controversial. In the film itself there is no reference to antichrist. The movie has some beautiful images sometimes, but I must admit that I found it slightly boring. I still wait for the day when Trier wakes up and starts making some see worthy movies, I think he can do it. How about an action movie? I like action movies!"
2,Ummm...hmmm...okay,"Alright so I bought into the hype and purchased this movie. It starts off with some hardcore pounding (I mean HARDCORE penetration). And basically this guy is so busy jamming his wife they forget to check on the kid, the kid falls out a window and the movie gets weird. I was bored for the most part but laughed at the wheel being attached to the dudes leg. I wouldn't recommend a buy, it tries to be artsy but falls flat. Kind of a dumb movie. Lots of skin and weirdness. OH, I almost forgot.. the chick cuts her clitoris off.. and they show it. WEIRD."
1,"Willem, what were you thinking?","Pretentious artsy wannabe flick that if it contains any good qualities, I missed them. Mr. Dafoe has never looked more bulimic and at what skank farm the casting crew found the lead actress, I haven't a clue.Dreadful movie in all but one respect. It is extremely illustrative of the non-science that Psychology/Psychiatry is. If you feel the need to sit through seemingly endless new age psycho-babble while watching two of the most unattractive people constantly fornicating....then have at it. I wish I could get my money back!!"
1,Director is totally self absorbed,"I watched this film only because of Willem Defoe. That is where the movie started and then stopped for me. I will make this simple. I thought it was a terrible movie. And I know some people will say I did not get the ""artistic"" part of the whole thing. My response to that is this, No, I got what the director was trying to do, but the whole time he was directing the movie, I got the impression he was off sitting in the corner thinking to himself ""Wow, I am making one heck of an artistic movie here"" Well no, all you did was some weak shock and awe, full penetration, genital mutilation, come on. Antichrist, why antichrist? should just be psycho, nut job."
1,A Waste of film!,I would have given this no stars if I had a choice.This movie is terrible and disgusting. Do not waste your time.
5,disturbing film,"this is a challenge to the mind, there are levels, troubling things, and dangerous things in it. I cannot recommend it -- but I am interested to understand what lies behind it based on all the extra materials with this disc set"
5,This is a movie only for the poetic at heart. Not for everyone!,"As soon as I finished seeing the prologue I knew that this film was only for the poetic at heart! The music, the black and white of it all (only in the prologue), the DIRECTING...all of it was beautiful! This movie displays a great deal of dark romanticism and, in the end, transforms into a very satanic metaphor. This was the first firm I'd ever seen by this director but i'm absolutely hooked. If you are the type of person that only like surface level movies without in deeper meanings, getting from point A to point B, like some of the other reviewers, then this film is absolutely not for you. But if you like movies that not only have a twisted plot, unholy fated characters (including a baby), and a style of directing that takes Edgar Allen Poe & Lord Byron and puts it into an actual movie that walks in the moonlight, then this is a master piece that you will want to buy ^_^"
1,"Slow moving, pseudo-philosophical, pretentious, bourgeois meladrama","I will not repeat the other poor ratings here. This is another film that tries to offer a refined and rarefied subject, but fails miserably to deliver anything more than long dull scenes, annoying sexual content (as if that were something profound in itself!) and snobby upper middle-class characters for whom no one could give a damn. I will still give Defoe a nod for being out of the ordinary, but just as with Anamorph, the films are just rotten."
1,chaos reigns indeed,"unfortunately, this movie was beautifully filmed. i say unfortunately because the plot is ridiculous, the characters are undeveloped, and the script is terrible. basically: the movie's beauty is wasted. this movie is full of holes and is excruciatingly painful to watch at parts - not just because it is so graphic but because it is so bad. i have no problem with graphic imagery if it's done well. maybe this movie is meant to have an underlying statement or metaphor. if it is, it has been smothered by heavy-handed, circumlocutory filmmaking. lars von trier is an egomaniacal idiot who somehow fools a lot of people into thinking he is a genius. i don't understand it. the only worthwhile thing in this movie is the cinematography. if you feel you must see it, you're in for a dissatisfying and pretty disturbing (with no purpose) ride."
2,This is not...,"This is NOT the uncut version, and therefore not worth the price. IFC picked up the film for distribution in the states and edited the sex/violence scenes. If you want von Trier's uncut vision you will have to get it through Amazon UK but it is in PAL Region 2 format, so there's the playability issue. Until someone in the US can get over their medieval notions of (plastic) morality we will have to purchase all region players."
2,strange,"this movie was disturbing to say the least! I don't think it was for me. I did think it was well written, but not my cup of tea."
4,Anticlit!,First I hated the movie in the beginning. Then by the end I found it very intriguing. Afterwards I began to search 16th century violence against women by Christians and my respect for the movie and appreciation for its symbols began to grow. This movie is about anti witch hysteria and mysogny in the European history and psyche and an unstable women who became obessed with those ideas.
1,Piece of crap!!,Waste of time and a piece of crap!!! I have now found a film that is worse than Eyes Wide Shut. It's weird and don't bother!!
1,What in the heck was this - a porn or just a boring movie,I was never so bored with this dribble. The only thing I got a kick out of is seeing William Defoe's character's insane wife drill a hole in his leg and put some kind of bolted grind stone bolted to it. He dragged him self around like a goon. I got a little tired of penis shots in the movie. The first part of the movie I thought I was watching a porn or something. iIn a nutshell WEIRD and BORING.
1,For Rental Only,"I can't imagine why anyone would own this movie. I mean, how many times can a ""normal"" person watch this one anyway?"
1,Not worth watching..,"I was expecting so much more from this film and it just wasnt' there. I tried and tried to get into it, and the film was hard to follow at times, and sometimes, just plain stupid. It was major angish to watch till the end, however, I did and wished I hadn't. Watch if it's for FREE and don't if you have to pay for it!"
1,"Awful, absolutely awful","I gave this movie a shot. It was so incredibly bad, it hurt. Pretentious, dull. This is only for the worshippers of Von Trier who like anything he does, no matter how bad. As for me, I'd rather watch something far less stupid, like Mission Impossible with Tom Cruise."
4,Delightful Diddy,"There are just very few songs out right now that really seem to have a good melody and taste of what true music is like. Maroon 5 is one of those few bands that really does catch on quickly, especially with a lot of tracks from Songs About Jane. Their latest single, Sunday Morning, the fourth single from that album, is a delightful pop song that has just a simplistic melodic beat that really is just remarkably delightful to listen to. It isn't one of those songs that really is overproduced, but just a nice, easy song. It is one of my favorites out there right now. I'm sure that once you hear this track, you'll definitely want to buy their album.Song: B+"
4,a great example of '60s british rock,"Ten Years After appeared in 1966, the same year that cream and jimi hendrix made their british debuts, marking a new era in british rock. These bands took american blues and added volume, jazz experimentalism, and their own unique twist to create a high point in rock development. Ten Years After featured the incredible guitar work of Alvin Lee, a player who merged jazz dexterity with rock and blues grittiness, but never achieved the same notoriety as his compatriots hendrix, clapton, jeff beck, or jimmy page. He himself always seemed to downplay his own ability, forever trying to outrun the image of him in sonic oblivion at woodstock. This album, though, captured the band in its live glory. It runs from scorching blues to seminal jazz fusion (""woodchoppers' ball""), all driven by lee's guitar. It is raw, loud, and unpolished, but incredibly good at capturing this band at their peak. Worth having, if only to capture a unique moment in rock history."
5,The best of TYA,"I saw Ten Years After at the Boston Tea Party back in the sixties. The bass player bobbed his head so hard and fast that he nearly passed out. Alvin Lee was not happy with thier first effort (SSSSH) so he decided doing another album before coming to the states. Unfortunately the studio they wanted to play was booked that night. They set up in a club on May 14th 1968 called Kook's Kleek in West Hampstead, North London. Roy Baker and Peter Rynston doctored the equipment at the Decca studios and threw leads to the club, hence the raw quality of the recording. Raw or not, in my opinion, the very best album they ever made. If you like blues, jazz and damn good guitar licks, this is the album."
5,Undead - Ten Years After,"In 1968 I had no interest in this album, but always admired TYA. I discovered this album through Pandora Radio. I bought it on iTunes and enjoyed it for several months before a hard drive crash (I had moved and not recently backed up my music), so I bought it from Amazon, but lo and behold it was the 2002 version, which had more songs and it was polished as well. What a gem this turned out to be. Alvin Lee, Leo Lyons, Ric Lee and Chick Churchill never sounded better."
4,great disc,"an oldie but goodie from the fastest guitar slinger (at that time) ""I'd love to change the world"" classic!! Alvin could and still can burn up the fretboard or squeeze feelings on slow blues"
4,Always been one of my favourites,"Should have been there when Alvin Lee & Co did play live. An amazing live album. This CD is better then the vinyl LP, more tracks, better sound."
5,Worth finding ......worth reading,"Ed Gorman in ""The Big Book of Noir"" said of David Goodis ""he didn't write novels, he wrote suicide notes"". This was enough to peak my interest and The Burglar(1953) was the first Goodis book I could get my hands on-it didn't disappoint-if you are into this sort of thing. A little perverse, a lot of morose, a good story, a lingering sadness. Goodis is reputed to be an acquired taste-not necessarily for everyone but if you like him chances are you'll like him alot-so far so good. Highly recommended."
5,Timeless!!!!,"I have used this book to train dozens of retrievers, pointers, and other dogs for over 30 years. The information and method Free imparts through the pages are timeless. I give this book as a gift to all my family and friends when they first get a retriever. His methods will always be successful. That is why ""Training Your Retriever"" will always be appropriately considered the retriever trainer's Bible!!!!"
2,Average book - seemed outdated,"I guess the book would be okay for someone training a Lab strictly for a hunting companion. As a general guide for dog training I found it lacking. The author spends alot of time talking about his experiences with Labs in the past and seems like a pretty miserable, ornery sort of guy. He has a few short drills concerning obedience training for your dog but then jumps into selecting a dog, training using field trials and gives references to friends in the business of breeding and training dogs. Problem is, the book was first written around 1940 with the last revision around 1977. Not too current. Again, for the hunter concerned with getting a top-quality Lab for field work, proabably a good book. For the average owner who wants a well-trained, loving pet around the house this book is not worth anything."
3,Somewhat interesting!,"This bio was interesting to some degree. I thought the impact one ""peasant"" could have on the course of a nation was sobering. This man demonstrates that some people will follow anyone. After watching this doc. I don't feel better educated in any important area."
4,Original chill,"More than anything else, I enjoy this album because it features tracks which are not common on other ""chill out"" compilations. This arguably is the best example of the type of music played in the ""chill out lounges"" in England's biggest clubs. The album is perhaps a little heavy-handed on the spoken-word samples and there is, in fact, one track which I skip (I won't mention which one). That said, it's a good spin."
3,Flowers were nice but wrong day and no vase.,"I ordered these for my mother's birthday. The flowers were lovely, but she received them 3 days too early! I was worried that I waited too long to order them so I expedited the shipping...but there wasn't a space to specify delivery date, so I was guessing as to how long. I think Amazon over-estimates how long their shipping will take in order to make it look as if things are happening earlier and faster than the consumer expects. Also, the flowers are pictured with a vase so I assumed that one was included. This was not so. My mother had to run home (the delivery was to her work) to get a vase for the flowers. Not such a big deal, but it was still misleading. Of course, a vase wasn't listed in the description, so it might as well be my fault for not looking. It wasn't a terrible experience, but I still won't be buying my flowers from Amazon in the future."
2,"Interesting book, limited value to collectors","This book has lots of illustrations taken from old music catalogs and limited text. Most of the text that is there is quoted from other sources. Information on about 10 companies only and skips some of the largest including Conn, Buescher, York, and Boosey and nothing on some of the smaller old brands like Lehnert. The valuations given are for specific instruments, and the guidelines for generalized pricing are next to useless, with statements such as: ""Valuing antique brass instruments is like shooting at a moving target in the dark."" All in all some limited information about a number of companies, and many interesting old illustrations of historic instruments, but not of much use in determining value of instruments other than the specific ones in the book."
2,Almost useless,"I have 25 years' experience in buying and selling antique wood and brasswinds, so this book was of very great interest. It claims to be a buyers'/collectors' guide but fails miserably. It gives lists of original prices for 19th century brasswinds by only TEN makers without consistent indication of current values. Pictures are arbitrary, poorly reproduced and often too small to be useful. Commonly encountered makers (Boosey, Gautrot, Sax etc) are absent. The ""subjective price list"" is poorly researched and not limited to antiques. Shame on Schiffer Publishing for publishing this book, it is almost useless. A potential buyer or seller will find little or no value in this book."
4,Word Perfect Office 2000 for Dummies,"This book covers most of Word Perfect Office 2000 in the usual quick and easy ""for dummies"" style, but it does NOT (as promised in the synopsis) review the use of Paradox. If you want info on using Paradox you will have to go somewhere else."
4,Best Bushido collection.,"The Bushido fights were based on action, this is a great formula if the styles fit. Team Japan vs. Gracie is rather slow until the young Gracies ,especially Ryan (R.I.P.), add a spark. The second disc is Japan vs. Chute Boxe so here is the action, not only does Chute Boxe Academy live up to it's name, Team Japan seems to respond making close matches. The third is less themed as in teams competing but all discs include great bouts outside the teams featuring Cro Cop and other greats. Remember, this revolves around action, so mostly fast stand-ups."
2,ufc is far superior to pride,"after watching all the ufc fights i decided to give pride fighting a try. and it does not even compare to ufc. so if you are a ufc fan dont waste your time on any pride fights. the rules are more strict, the fighters pretty much suck and it is pretty boring. whats the deal with wearing pads and no kicks to the head? or no knees to the head? no thank you i will stick with ufc."
4,The original classic,"This is a reprint of the text that first considered risk along with return in portfolio management! Nobel-prize winner Harry Markowitz explains the theory upon which modern portfolio theory is based in minimal mathematical terms. Of course there has been much subsequent academic research in portfolio theory (much of which is contained in an included bibliography up to 1970), but this book is an outstanding starting point for anyone interested in the efficient management of financial portfolios"
4,So sad,Great stories but so sad!Recommended but not if you're feeling low.Some of the stories are quite short but still very effective.
1,Waist of Time,"This book was recommended to me by a highly respected professional in the field. Though the material in Rogers' book appears provocative, I got ""tired and toxic"" reading it. I highly respect alternative approaches toward health, yet a lot of the information in this book is not only dated but can be found on the internet for free! After reading the 1st and 2nd chapters I forced myself to read the succeeding pages to the point that I just had to get rid of it. This book is a waist of time and money and trees and ink to print it. Don't Bother!"
4,A breathless over-the-top read,"There's a quote from Elmore Leonard on the back of the jacket for Cul-de-Sac to the effect that ""the man knows how to write."" And he definitely does. But his adept turn of phrase sometimes gets the better of him as he tries to sound hard-boiled. (He's always using slightly caricature-worthy phrases like ""gnarled corridors of pain"")Despite that, Cul-de-Sac is a sprint to the finish, implausible yet exciting, an engaging and insubstantial twisted tale with gore by the bucket."
1,Players No Longer On Team,I got this calendar for my daughter and was shocked that there are 4 players shown that are no longer on the team. I can almost understand players that we're traded this winter but Bobby Abreu and David Bell we're traded in July and they both have months on the calendar. The other two players are Mike Leiberthal and Gavin Floyd. Hard to beleive they couldn't find someone other thatn Gavin Floyd ?????
1,Battery does not last!!,"Picture is not bad when it is working but do not bother to buy this unless you buy a car adapter power cord. When fully charged the battery only lasts about 10- 15 minutes, so unless it is plugged in somewhere get ready for a black screen."
4,Don't sell yourself short go ahead & impress your lover!,"This group of Latinos are touching the hearts of people who understand the passion of love. Their R&B genre puts them on the level of R. Kelley, Boys to Men, Jagged Edge etc. Representing Philly like it'll soon lead the way in romance."
5,"Wonferful music, with a great value for price.","Naxos never seems to disappoint when it comes to releasing high-quality classical recordings at a reasonable price -- and this disc of Brahms' Violin Sonatas is no exception. Ilya Kaler is a wonderful violinist, and with accompanist Alexander Peskanov, this duo really brings the music fully to life. I've been listening to this CD several times since I ordered it, and I think it's a worthy addition to anyone's collection."
5,Pricey but worth it,This is a book that should be brought back into print. It retailed for less thsn 6.00 but now copies sell for 40.00 +. The information contained in the book is of use to anyone who has a remote property and uses a woodstove for cooking and heat. It allows you to have hot water for cleaning and other needs. So if the author is listening how about bringing the book back in print or even updating it.
2,wt tape,I was anxious to get my horse weight because I have a with a murmur and the vet wanted me to get a hundred poiunds on her. Her weight at that time was 900 lbs. I worked very hard to get weight on her and when the tape came the instructions had been cut off during manufacturing. What a huge disappointment. I had to put my horse on a trailer and take her to the vet to have her weight checked. I threw the tape away.
2,Ten pounds of **** in a five pound bag,"This video is a real disappointment. It covers at least twelve different engineering disasters in 50 minutes, and, as you might expect, gives each of them almost no depth. The video itself is riddled with errors, such as the allegation that the MV Stockholm was a ""cargo"" ship, and showing at least eight different submarines (one of them a TRIDENT) as the Thresher. The St. Francis dam disaster, which was the one I really wanted to see, is little more than ""the dam broke."""
1,Modern Marvels-More Engineering Disasters,Modern Marvels-More Engineering Disasters can befound in its entirety on the Modern Marvels-Technology set. The Technology set is also soldhere on Amazon and has 7 more dvds and is only afew dollars more than this. Don't make the mistakeI did... Ok dvd but nowhere near enough contentfor the price.
4,"Not as good as the full series, but still good enough","This DVD basically just adds an hour to the full 14-hour Engineering Disasters collection. As such, it's not as good of a value from a cost standpoint.And as noted by another reviewer, they cram quite a few case studies into this hour, so the coverage of each case lacks some depth.Despite that, the quality of the DVD is still good overall, so I think this is well worth getting if you have an interest in engineering disasters."
2,Can't play it outside DVD zones,"PROsAs a documentary, it is ""fair"" quality, and an interesting compilation.CONsIt was not clear that it would only play in US-players. Taken to Europe, it would not play because of the zone difference. This was not obvious by the details prior to purchase."
2,Doesn't Swing Enough for Me,"I had high expectations for this CD since the session was led by Pete Candoli, who was married to Lane when this 1959 release was recorded. The cast of sidemen also includes such greats as Barney Kessel, Jimmy Rowles, and Joe Mondragon. But while the arrangements are creative at times, they are more often completely unsuited to Lane's voice. She is at her best on gently swinging, sultry numbers like ""Our Very Own"" and ""You Hit the Spot."" Too many of the selections are frantically paced, often with an accompanying xylophone seemingly out of a 1950's movie about the frenetic lifestyle of New York City, or Lane tries for the artistic effect, pushing her voice out of its natural range. The results are hardly pleasing, which may explain why this was Lane's only major label release."
1,Don't Buy This,"I just purchased a Wadsworth 2 Pole 20 AMP breaker. It's new, but it came without the setscrews to tighten down the feed wires...... so someone bought it, took out the screws, returned it, it got put back on the shelf. It's unusable, a very expensive paper weight."
4,Short but Clear and Readable,"If you want to find a soild but not too depth. This is a good choice. This serious many like a notebook more than a commentray.But this one is really readable than other.John E. Hartley do the great job to shorter the detail and depth commentaries in a short commentary but not loss the critical point of view in this new commentary,If you consider the content and price. this up to date content worth than the price."
4,Please reissue 1 & 2,I loved the Mr. Peepers Show of the early 50s. I joined the Navy in 54 to 58 and got the Paul Gallico books in the ship's library and liked them too. I found out that Wally Cox was cast as Hiram Holiday and I was not able to see the show. Here's my chance. I orded Vol. 1. Please reissue Vol. 2. I saw Wally Cox tooling around New York city on motorcycle. A once in lifetime thrill.John Weeber FP2c
1,Westchesters Forgotten Railroad? Forget this book if you're smart,Arcara's is regarded as the #1 authority on the NYW&B railroad and like all his other books and papers on the subject he completely ignores the Bronx portion of this great railroad. Save your money folks.
4,Perfect companion book to Guptill's,"I finally found a good-condition copy of this at a reasonable price and I am glad I bought it. It is a perfect companion book to Guptill's ""Rendering in Pen and Ink: The Classic Book On Pen and Ink"". This book has great information on the care and use of the Technical Pen and has more imaginative examples of pen and ink than Guptills more traditional (but, none the less beautiful and important) works. This book also has more on the ""process"" of doing an initial pencil outline,choosing pen strokes and building up patterns to create a drawing. It includes a section of problems to avoid with pen strokes and tones etc. which was very helpful to me. I would have never thought of using the patterns the author used to render some of the drawings. I look forward to playing with these in my own drawings. I would recommend getting both of these books and you should have all you need for a really good foundation in pen and ink."
5,amazing fusion rnb album from good old 80`s!!!,"simply one of the best r`nb fusion album from 80`s, jeff always comes through. but this one shows his pop side exremly well!!"
5,"you,re the man",i remember this song from 1986 but didnt knew who sang it so they played it on the radio and found out it was jeff lorber featuring the sexy karyn white and micheal jeffres he discovered karyn white very put together album i have the cassette impossible to find if you do its gonna cost you a lot
2,Fine content shameful binding,"The background and recipes are quite good but the paper back book is a disgrace. My copy is less than a year old but nearly every page has separated from the ""perfect"" binding. The publisher should give a[...]to anyone who has bought this. Five stars for the author, [...], so a two overall."
5,Meat for the mature Christian,"War on the Saints (the full unabridged edition)takes the open-minded reader to a new level of understanding about what spiritual warfare consists of in our Christian walk. I liked the book for the ""meat"" that it contains and the courage the author had to expose the enemy for who he is and what wiles he will use. This book touches on aspects of the Christian walk that few preachers want to delve into, whether out of fear or complacency. Be prepared to examine your own heart and ""go to war for those in bondage"". I found more help in the first 50 pages of this book than I've seen in a number of other complete books. I would highly recommend this volume, and once you are able to get it, keep it to read and re-read. This book was recommended to me by a 75 year old Mennonite who's ministry focused on deliverence for most of his life."
5,Should be WIDELY distributed to CHRISTIANS,"This book withdraws you from being preoccupied with unnecessary problems in life; especially with problems that seem too complex that you don't realize it's spiritual. Also, it emphasizes that there IS complete emancipation for Christians. If you are a Christian, YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK."
2,abridged edition takes away from author's main intent!,"in some cases an abridged edition of a book is a good way to make the reading flow because of excess themes or out of date language, but this abridged edition was basically a censored text. the author's main intent was to expose the acitivity of demonic spirits, yet a whole aspect of that acitivity has been excluded which makes the abridged edition part of the deception it was originally written to expose!"
2,I couldn't pick it up,"You know how when you love a book you say you can't put it down? Well, I just could not get into this book. I have tried a few times to read it and seldom get through the first chapter. It just did not connect with me."
1,This is not the book Corrie ten Boom recommended,"When Corrie ten Boom recommended ""War on the Saints"" by Penn Lewis, I thought I had found it in this book. What I did not realize is that this is an abridged version of the original. This version cuts out the actions of the Holy Spirit, and eliminates any discussion of Christians being posessed by evil spirits. If you wish to have a copy of the original, go on Amazon and look for the unabridged version. It is available in soft or hardback, with several more pages. You most likely will not find the unabridged version in your local Christian bookstore, nor will they be able to order it.War on the Saints, The Full Text, Unabridged Edition"
1,Bad,"How can I trust a doctor who doesn't admit that a low or better no fat diet is unhealthy, even more when studies and researches demonstrate that the countries with the lowest heart disease are France and Italy? The Mediterranean diet has a normal percentage of healthy fats, like the ones in olive oil and fish.What does he say about fish? ""You might say, well, why not eat fish, because then you can get the fish oil directly from the fish. And you can. The problem is that the fish with the highest amount of omega 3 fatty acids are also the highest in fat and cholesterol""....so.....his answer is to take pills instead of eating healthy fish 3 times a week with a big salad!!!"
4,"Okay, so it's not the usual TYA album","Ten Years After did something different and good here and it was perfectly applicable after doing hard blues for the previous four or five years. A talented musicians' drive is always to keep searching and trying different things other than reproducing the sound of previous albums, in which Lee & Co. are no exception to the rule, where Stonehenged proved that very rule. It's a good record by itself. As for the poor reviewers, consider whining about The Beatles or Beach Boys on why Revolver or Pet Sounds is so different than their previous material and see how that goes."
3,STONED- henge,"Just like the title, I think these guys were stoned when they did this album. Consequently this was album was realised in 1969 the same year Pink Floyd realised ummagumma, go figure? If you read the liner notes of ssshhhhh I think the record execs were on Alvin Lee and Co. to realise something so they put this out. It doesn't seem like they put a lot of effort into it. There are some good songs such as hear me calling, Sad Song, Going to try and speedkills. But a lot of filler. If you are new to TYA start with SSShhh, A space in time, or Watt."
3,a expiremental work.,"Most ten years after fans want blues rockin and hard rock, but this one is a experimenatal work that has jazzy influences. That's not a bad thing but unless you like that type o feffort from a rock band then you may not like this one. It does have great musicianship though and even a drum track that is just the drummer playing. But just a few months later this band would explode into a proper monster heavy rock outfit with the release of 'sssh'. That one will appeal to rock fans more than this one. Howver this is a good effort and different , it needs a patient listen because like I said most fans of this band only like hard rock. I like all kinds of music so I like it , it's a four star expiremental rock cd and three star rock cd. SO it's somewhere inbetween. ALL the five star raters are right though because they love the different nature of this one."
5,Stonedhedge . Ten Years After,"What a CD this is. I first got into Ten Years After after watching an old video of the concert at the Isle of Wight that took place in 1970. That was a couple of years ago and I was absolutely blown out with their performance of ""I cant keep from crying somtimes"" what a guitarist and what a fantastic blues/jazz/rock band. I have since bought just about everything they have put out. Alvin Lee is an underated legend and he and the bands ability to change their sound from album to album is mind blowing. Stonedhedge is just a classic example of their ability to do this as it is a journey all the way through. I just am so grateful that I have experienced all of this 40 years later as if I hadnt watched that Isle of Wight concert I would of missed them and these guys are the underated legends."
5,Stonedhenge,"Stonedhenge was a great album, it was one of Ten Years Afters best albums. What people fail to relaize is the skill that is put into this album. Sure the work is different, but it shows the unique talents of the band showing their ability to play different types of music. People who dislike this album just want to hear the basic blues that some Ten Years Songs are. But you have to listen the bass sounds in Sad Song, and some of the work with the guitar playing with the bass a little bit. This album took awhile to grow on me, and I seem to enjoy muisc more when it seems to grow on me then liking it right away. I learn to apperitate the skill that was put into this awsome work. THIS ROCKS."
3,"Good, but lacking in some departments","The author has done an overall decent job in dissecting the Andrews Sisters rollercoaster career, however I was surprised that there were no photographs of sheet music or even a record album. Not even one. The singing trio released hundreds of albums over the decades, yet no photograph of an LP album cover in this book. I'd have liked to have seen what the first album cover looked like and even their final LP release."
2,Numbingly repetitive,"Save your money, just download the 30 second preview samples and loop them each for 5 minutes and you won't be able to tell the difference. There's inspired trance out there, but this sure ain't it..."
2,May Blitz - The Second of May,"This CD is good, but not great. It's strange, It's the same line up but both the music and the words are not as good as the first (self titled)CD.In fact the words are kind of cheesey. It's worth keeping however."
4,Money well spent,Picks up every wireless camera in the vincinity. You'd be surprised how many there are.
3,Camera Monitor,"Quality of picture is not as good as advertised and, even close to camera has wavy lines"
1,Never received product,Swann Mobile Viewer SW-G-MVIEW 2.4GHz 2.5 LCD Color Screen 4 Channel Security Camera LCD ReceiverSeller never sent product and referred me to Amazon AtoZ
4,Monitor,"Being cordless is huge. There are some problems with reception occasionally, must have relatively clear line (few walls or doors)."
4,HP DVD840i,"The HP DVD840i with Lightscribe works great. It installed with no problems and works as described. Be aware, software does not come with most cheaper priced units. Nero trial software is what I ended up using (for 30 days)."
3,Its plastic?,"I took a chance on this product and ordered 2 for my shop.No where in the description was it stated what they were made from,I received them and low and behold there made of plastic,Don't they make these out of wood anymore,I'm not sure how long they will hold upbut i needed them and will use them and update on any problems if any."
1,The Ol' Switcheroo!,"Ordered the cleaner with Teflon, which I couldn't find in stores. Description said ""Teflon"", pictured was a box that said ""Teflon"", received a case of cleaner - no Teflon. Could have bought THAT at Wal-Mart. Thanks for wasting my time."
1,Worthless,Does not even pass for a metronome let alone a tuner. The loudest sound the metronome cannot be heard when playing piano. Stay away from this one. I have had it for less than 2 years and it has now inoperable.
2,I couldn't get thru it either,"Although highly motivated, I got through about 30 pages before quitting. I loved other Henry James, so this one must be just too difficult."
4,dense yet worthwhile,"Another tough Henry James read still contains his best leading character> In fact, all the characters here are well drawn, even ones you never meet, like Mrs. Newsome, who is strictly an indirect background force. James always wrote very piercing stories of moral and romantic conflict and this one, vague and hard as the langauge can be, is no exception. Despite the narrative's thickness, you can't helped but be awed by how a master can re-arrange the English tongue to sound this beautiful. You will feel every inch of being in Paris here, and, as well, the frustration and confusion of every lost soul in the story. Even the scared conformist characters are vividly drawn. Another amazing effort by a writer who isn't always easy to dissect. Requires more than a brief sit thru. Stick with it, you will feel like you've lived the book yourself."
5,an excellent final volume for the Cadfael saga,"Ellis Peters has again delivered an outstanding Brother Cadfael book. This adventure combines all of the elements we have grown to love - a pivotal event in the war between Maud and her cousing Stephen, Cadfael's relationship with his son and Cadfael's relationships within the Abbey. And of course a mystery or two to be solved along the way.If you're a Brother Cadfael fan, this book is definitely for you. I feel it is one of the best books in the series. Unfortunately, with the death of Ellis Peters, this is the final chronicle of Brother Cadfael."
4,Brother Cadfaels' Passing,"This twentieth chronicle of Brother Cadfael reads as if Ellis Peters knew it would be her last. It is a fitting end to the series, though many of us would wish for more. She drew together several loose ends from previous novels, and left us with a sense of closure on Cadfaels' vocation. As reported elsewhere, the tone is more somber, but perhaps appropriately so.Also, as others have mentioned, don't read this unless you've read of Oliver's two previous appearances.Fare you well, Cadfael...and Ellis Peters"
5,The war between fathers and sons,"This book is the final one in the Brother Cadfael series, and gratefully brought to full circle Cadfael's adventures with his son Oliver. In Virgin in the Ice, Cadfael learns at the end of the adventure of Oliver's existence, and in The Pilgram of Hate, Cadfael admits to his friend Sheriff Hugh Beringar that Oliver is his son. But now, in the final creation of Ellis Peters, Cadfael learns that Sir Oliver has been taken hostage and no one knows his whereabouts, and Cadfael leaves his order in search of his son and the solution of not one but two murders. The ending of this story is absolutely brilliant, and there is a scene with Earl Robert and his son Phillip that makes me cry everytime I read it. The theme is fathers and sons, and the story will warm your heart. It was the fitting end to a masterful murder mystery series!"
3,THIS IS A PLAY VERSION,"Anyone who may be interested in buying this item should be aware that it is the play, and not the actual book (which is out-of-print). Still a good story!"
3,Rubber cracks after 5 months of use,"Bought 2 of these for my 94 Toyota Camry.Both the box and the bushing had marks ""Made in Japan"". Very nice!I removed the old bushings and pressed these by myself.The rubber looks very strong, metal ring fits tight in the arm.Overall feel is that this will last quite long. I put 5 stars for now and let's see ...I'll check each half-a-year and give a feedback here. Installation date: Feb 20 2012.Update on June 10, 2012.2 stars down, now it's 3 stars. Due to yesterday I was working under the car and noticed a crack of rubber just near the inner metal tube!The rubber of original was disconnected from outer ring while this one goes out from inner.Will monitor further, hope it will not get more stars down."
4,The Philosophy of Classical Yoga,"The book is much more academic than I expected and needed, It dwells extensively on the meaning of certain key concepts, mainly in sankscrit. Excellent for a sanskrit scholar, not for a reader interested in a purely philosophical analysis.."
1,Loan?,This was a loan from my daughter but I was charged for it.Actually I enjoyed the book very much.Guess won't try terminating again
3,Stories from a real live Santa's life.,A review of many aspects of this Santa's life. Itincludes interesting interviews with real live kidswith heart wrenching requests.
5,Love me some Perfume,"Even though most of the songs are old by now, you still can't help but smile at the upbeat tunes and how innocent they sounded when they were younger.I have always been a huge fan of Perfume and this CD is the perfect example of why."
5,YEAH YEAH YEAH,"The song ""Sho Nuff"" is the best song by Fatboy. Better than ""The Rockafeller Skank"". Buy this cd for that and you will be happy, but noooooo there is more, a mix by Aphrodite and Mulder. Excellent cd."
2,I wouldn't buy it.,"Luckily, I didn't have to. One of my friends made a tape of the album for me. Well, here's what I have to say:The songs, even though they sound good and have feasible (sp?) tunes to them, wind up being repetitive (I mean, really, how many times does he have to say ""Right About Now, the funk soul brother, check it out now""? And btw, those are the ONLY lyrics in the song!), and getting butchered by a million choppy little sound effects.""Fatboy Slim"" has a bad habit of taking a song that has a potential to be great and ruining it with stupid sound FX that bore and irritate the listener -- at least this listener, anyway."
1,Good God you idiots!,"Have you seen the music video for this song? It totally sucks. In my opinion, It's a load of s**t!!"
3,Praise you is awful.. but..,Well.. Praise You makes me violently ill.. really not one of his better efforts... ick.. and the Rockafeller Skank remix on here is nothing like the original song... basically a loop from the song that is good for the first 20sec... but it keeps going forever... gets on your nerves.. I bought this single just for Sho Nuff.. which is a great song.. should have been on the album... but then I wouldn't have bought this single.. hehe.. it's a great track though... an upbeat happy song.... check it out...
1,Out-of-control song with even worse video,"Sorry, Fatboy Slim went loco with that absurd-as-hell video with people dancing like maniacs, and the photography of that video looks like it was recorded on MTV."
5,Convertible Gloves/Mittens Womens,I absolutely love my glittens. My co-workers have threatened to steal them from me.
5,wonderful,I love that proceeds from this book and others go toward a good cause and the book was beautiful
4,Familes Are Forever,"I bought this book while I was waiting for my referral. Now my daughter is almost 3 and we are just starting to read it. It's a good book. My daughter likes the pictures quite a bit, and the language is not too hard for her to understand. We talk a lot about adoption and how she was born in China. She doesn't really ""get it"" yet, but this book certainly helps the discussion come up in a more natural way. Plus, I like that it reminds us that we are together forever now!"
2,Not nearly as simple as that!,"I am an adoptive mother, I have done quite a bit of research about adoption, and I have written my Master's thesis about adoption and its perspectives in children's literature. This book oversimplifies the subject and leads children to believe that an adopted baby understands the journey she begins when she meets her forever family. The text is nothing like what a six year old (the supposed age of the character narrator) would use. The pictures are over simple in some parts to look as if a child has drawn and colored them, and in other parts they are something like a bizarre cross between a photo and a sketch. They are not likely to draw a young child in or hold their interest.It is impossible that this character, Rain, would have had all of the thoughts and feelings she tells her young readers she had. Many, many other adoption books are out there for children. Do not spend your money and time on one that paints an over-simplified story. It's NOT as simple as that."
1,Languishing in the thoes of another aborted literary attempt,"Melodramatic and wholly uninspiring, Ross crafts her characters in roughly the same manner a three-year-old might scrawl on old newspaper with a crayon. Her hackneyed turns-of-phrase are better suited to B-movie tag lines (i.e. ""No sane person would willingly return to hell."" AND ""To stop could mean death. Or worse.""), and the plot suffers from an unfortunate case of the yips--all stops and (quasi-)starts. The story itself is molded in the crusty fashion of a circa-1970's made for television movie, complete with horrible dialogue and one static character after another. In all, it lacks the depth, texture, and compelling narrative found in more worthwhile reads. And at $20 a pop, ""False Security"" in no way comes close to earning its keep, unless one considers that the pages could possibly double as a litter box liner."
2,Writer needs to expand imagination,"The book is a tired rehash of tv show and movie plots. Mrs. Ross needs to work on making her next novel (if their is one) into a more complicated read. For $20, 203 pages is just not enough. Overall, the book may be a good start for the author. I will keep an eye out for future material."
2,Too expensive for 7.5 oz (1 unit),"This product is overpriced. Walmart sells the 56 oz refill ($4.77) for less than this 7.5 oz (over $5.00). I'm not sure if this is more than 1 unit for this price, but I'm not able to confirm that anywhere in the description."
4,Order multiple copies,My soon to be teenage son has Asperger's Syndrome. This is a great way to give him some social guidance without my lecturing him. The title is perfectly intriguing for a kid. The mother's in my support group are all ordering copies for their kids.
4,Good enough,"I just needed the basic tables, not anything fancy, not even a Mollier diagram, and I needed it fast. ...and that's exactly what I got."
3,Data Center Design,"This book does provide some good hands on information related to Data Center design and implementation along with some interesting description of Terms & Glossary, it's worth having in your bookshelfBest,Malahat Qureshi Ph.D."
4,Pretty good controller,I bought this controller about 1 year ago. It still works perfectly. I like the glowing idea and it works 10x better than the wireless ones of this same brand. The Iglow wireless controllers break after only a few months. The only problem I had was that the right joystick wouldnt work when you clicked it down. For those who play Halo you know that's the way to zoom in. I took the controller apart and I fooeld around with it and put it back together and it worked perfectly. Very satisfied.
4,Xbox IGlow Controller Green,"The controllers were as stated. They work well and the kids love the fact they glow green while playing games. Would recommend for a purchase, the price was right for these."
2,Not the best,"Unfortunately the Tanzquartett Wien chose to pursue the ""interpretive"" route in performance. The result is a sloppy, easy-listening style which exemplifies the Italian peculiarity of Tempo rubato (stolen time).For elevator or cafe music, I suppose one could do worse. For actual ballroom music in true Vienna period style, to which one could actually dance waltzes, forget it.Try instead the excellent performances by the late Willi Boskovsky and his ensemble. Sadly, many of these are not in current issue. The used/collector's aftermarket within this retailer are a good source from which I have obtained CDs of many of Boskovsky's works."
3,Great for an Oktoberfest celebration!,"I purchased this title for an Oktoberfest I held in my home. It was the perfect backdrop for a theme party. I'm not really into that kind of music per se, but it fit the mood."
1,piece of crap,Never did get the software to work so don't know if hardware was any good. got the run around from vendor.
3,"Good heater, unreliable perks","The heater portion of this unit performs admirably: fast heat generation, quiet fan - good for warming small to medium-sized rooms in a short amount of time. The heater does eat a fair amount of current - the manual rates it at around 13 to 14 amps, which may be a big deal if you're on a circuit with only a 15 amp breaker. It's also light and compact, so it's easy to carry from one room to another, and doesn't take up much space.The downside is that some of the fancier features of this unit are unreliable - the oscillating base tends to bind and gnash gears, making a loud cracking sound. It also seeps oil from the base. Also, the digital thermostat is inaccurate, and has a tendency to lose calibration over several hours. I've purchased two of these heaters, and I've noticed all three problems with both.As a space heater, it fits the bill well. But be advised that you may not get full use of the other features that you are paying for."
4,So quiet!,"This is a very quiet space heater - much quieter than any other I have had. It is fairly powerful, too, but it does take a little while to heat up a room. It is definitely not the most powerful heater on the market, but its quietness more than makes up for that. If you can be patient enough to wait about an hour for full room heat-up, it's worth having this very quiet heater."
4,Hotness....,Great little heater - very compact and efficient. oscillation feature is nice. Just make sure that your electrical system is strong enough to handle this bad boy- 1500 watts killed the power in my old apartment a couple of times... Make sure its on at least a 40A breaker otherwise you may not be able to use this guy...
1,Not what I was expecting,I was not expecting this book to be a European review of the history of English cattle.Very hard to read for me.
5,Great Cables,"I have these cables for my audio engine a5's and a2's they are hooked up to my HRT Music Streamer II + , and I also use them with my NuForce Icon uDAC-2 when combined with either of these dac's and speakers you will be blown away by sound reproduction."
2,"Mostly great products, but disappointed by this particular sermon.","I would not hesitate to order any other sermons carried by this seller. I have 5 so far, and plan to buy more. However, I was a bit disappointed by this particular sermon. I think it is okay, however. If you are really searching for answers on this subject, go ahead and order it as you may get more out of it than I did."
2,A slight disappointment,"I've read many of Andrea Kane's novels and I do have to admit that The Music Box was a slight disappointment. It's hard to describe but you just couldn't really get into the story. Usually with her novels, you can't put the book down, but this one, you can leave it. It draws your attention in after a while, but it's not as suspenseful as her other novels. Gabrielle's guardian--Hermione was cute with her quirky staff, but things were a little too rushed and unreal. Not everything clicked. Gabrielle was a beautiful girl, but a little too predictable, which makes her character slightly flat, the same with Bryce Lyndley. The book is just okay, nothing great. Not very satisfying for someone who has read much of Andrea Kane already. To put it simply, I've definitely read better of Kane."
3,I just couldn't get into the characters,"I was disappointed by this story. I found the storyline all too predictable. I just couldn't get into the characters, I never found myself feeling what they were supposed to be feeling. It was hard for me to believe that Bryce could fall in love that quickly, maybe lust, but not love. It was a book that I could put down any time. The suspense was lacking too. All-in-all, not really worth my time."
2,Good Book,"The beginning of the book was a little slow but once I got into it I couldn't put it down, some scenes were a little boring, this was not one of her best works. I read a lot of books and have read a few of hers that were much better."
1,Avoid,"Overpriced and underpowered..... This software is more annoying then anything else. You practically have to turn off every setting to get your networked printers and network games to work, for example.(...)"
1,Disappointed in California,"I have been a Norton Internet Security user for years with total satisfaction. Upgrading to the 2004 version has nearly destroyed my Microsoft Outlook - it took hours to get back my previous Emails and more importantly my Address Book. It is still not as it was, but at least I can see everything. My Freecell is totally unusable. Also having problems with Word. The Symantec website has many articles to read to 'fix' what is broken by uploading the product. Too bad they didn't put as much effort into fixing it. I'm deleting this version from my computer and moving to something that will work!"
2,Its a hog.,Let me start by admitting that I don't have a top of the line computer (1 GHz Duron with 256 MB of RAM) but it was certainly fast enough for me until I installed Norton Internet Security.I'll give it two stars because the virus scan works pretty good. I primarily bought the product because I was interested in the Parental Controls (web site filtering). It works but it made me feel like 15 years ago when I was on a 486 with a dial up modem. Looking at Task Manager in XP I saw that the internet filtering application had sucked up 86 MB of RAM and a good percentage of the CPU time. Maybe if you have a 2-3 GHz machine and 512 MB of RAM it would run better.My solution was to disable everything and do a manual virus scan once in a while. For content filering I got the Linksys WRT54GS router and signed up for the Parental Control subscription. So far I am happy with the Linksys router (my computer is back up to speed and no porn). After some time with it I'll put in a review for it.
1,Dysfunctional Program !!!!!!!!,"1: Before installing Norton Internet Security 2004, my computer was running at 75-80 percent. After installation, it is running 25-30 percent. SSSLLLLLOOOOOOWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!2: Microsoft Excel will not run after installation.3: I keep getting ""Program Faults"" since installation and then Windows crashes.4: Microsoft Games will not run (even after reloading from Microsoft web site).As far as I am concerned, this program is junk, and I am going to get my money back and try PC-cillin (per good reviews on thissite)."
1,"run zone alarm pro, find a virus program that works manually","It's really a shame that there are no products like this that aren't total hogs, aimed and prices at the consumer market and yet not require 15 Microsoft certifications to operate. I find it quite hillarious that this intrusion and privacy product becomes impossible to uninstall, hacks into your existing software without asking(ie it will install itself in outlook and give you no means of removing it from same, and outlook will not work if you do manage to kill all of the symantec crap), and spams you with an ominous looking red exclamation point when you turn any of it's crap off.Truthfully, the world is fairly computer literate, is it not trespassing to so blatantly burrow so far into your property as all software does now, while deliberately not telling you and making it impossible to remove?"
1,Disaster,"Once you get it to work it is pretty good. In general, now that I have cooled down, I am probably happy. However, I have installed this product on 4 computers and it has crashed all 4 in some fashion. This product cost me over 25 hours to recover my systems damaged from the installation. At a minimum, make a full back up before starting the install. I was even an existing Norton customer with installed Norton software and it still crashed my computers. Norton has a real problem and they won't even acknowledge it. I think they are basically a good company and this is basically a good product but it is not ready for primetime. Bottom-line, unless you are a real PC weenie with lots of time on your hands when things go wrong, don't install this product. Maybe worth revisiting in the future."
1,Sad direction,"I am not impressed with NIS 2004 and have abandoned it for Zone Alarm despite prior satisfaction with NIS. I can't complain since NIS is usually cheap after rebates. However several issues with 2004 have soured me including the fact that after I installed it on an XP system, it blocked ALL access to the Internet. Then after uninstalling and trying again, I had to call Symantec and wait 30 minutes for it to allow me to enter the product registration code (Symantec is now not allowing multiple installs for your home computers) and still didn't work. Finally, the free support is lackluster. I decided to spend my money on a new product rather than paid support for this product. Goodbye NIS, maybe I will try you again someday"
1,Beware on Win 98 SE,"BEWARE. This product may cause corruption under Windows 98 Second Edition. I installed it on a Dell XPSR450 Pentium II, 450 Mhz, running Win98SE and it not only corrupted Windows, but also caused physical hard drive sector damage so bad the drive had to be replaced. I am no novice, been in IT for 26 years and have built and repaired many PCs and Macs. This was an older machine but it worked flawlessly and had the drive wiped with clean installs of all apps and Windows just a couple of months prior. No spyware, viruses, etc. This machine was in good shape behind a hardware and software firewall with Norton Antivirus updated 3 times a week, and Windows fully updated. Norton Internet Security killed my hard drive!I've never had problems with Norton products on PCs or Macs prior to this."
1,Rendered my PC unbootable,After installing this program and applying LiveUpdate I was asked to reboot. Now my PC will not boot - it only blue screens.
2,it's working after 6 hours of hassles...,"This product actually seems to be working now, but only after two tech-savvy people spent 3 hours each trying to get it working. The final solution was fairly simple, but getting there wasn't much fun. The Symantec online tech support is next to useless, so be warned if you don't have the patience to fix installation problems if they arise, which it sounds like they do quite often. That said, it seems to be up and running...for now..."
1,Norton Computer Insecurity 2004,"Like many people who have had complaints about this program, I can only conclude that this program, itself, is a virus. In fact, it's the worst virus that I have ever had infect my system. It crashed my windows explorer, which could no longer detect network drives nor my printer, USB ports were lost, and Internet Explorer became sluggish. The first time I installed I had to do a complete reinstall of my OS. The second and third time I attempted to install, I <only> had to completely uninstall NIS2004 (thank God).This is utterly inexcusable from a company that is supposed to PREVENT problems on a PC. Norton 2004--you stink! I'll stick with 2003 until I can find a decent replacement..."
1,S L O W. S L O W E R.........,"I run Win98 and a Pentium 2. I replaced the 2001 version (which ran fine). This slows down my system to the point of being unusable. I installed, uninstalled, custom reinstalled with less features with the same result. Installed OK, may run OK on P4 machines. Wouldn't use with older hardware."
1,BUYER BEWARE-Amazon is crooked,"I bought this product from Amazon, it was a copy of an original and quit working. I called Symantec and they told me it was a fake. I'm in the process of trying to get a refund or chargeback. Don't buy from Amazon"
2,Good product w/ bugs & poor support,"The good: seems to do a better job of autoconfiguring the firewall for known software than NIS 2002. Liveupdate works for updated definitions.The bad: I didn't want to update from NIS 2002 in the first place, but its Liveupdate brought in an update that caused the firewall to use every last bit of the CPU and slow surfing to an unusable rate. A support call to Symantec costs more than an upgrade and they don't support anything prior to their 2003 application, so I upgraded. Now I find that if you use Outlook with more than one profile, Norton's Antispam will crash it every time you switch profiles (i.e. users). Apparently, they've known about this since 2002, but, unlike other software companies that had similar bugs (e.g. Groove), Norton has not provided a fix. To top it off, when you upgrade, you lose any time you had remaining on your old subscription to virus definition updates and such (I lost 6 months)."
4,New Version works Fine for Me,"I didn't have any major problems installing this software. The only problem I had was a few components didn't quite load correctly upon startup, but a reboot fixed the problem. I had NIS 2003 and was very happy with it; this new version really doesn't seem to offer a lot of exciting new features, seems merely the same as 2003 dressed-up to look like a new version. Anyhow, this software is working fine and no problems since I installed it two weeks ago. I give it 4-stars only because the installation process - or rather problems that may surface during the installation process - can be frustrating to the average computer user. If you experience problems with installation, you can visit symantec's website, click the support tab, click the 'home or home office support' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the Norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it. Can't get easier than that!"
1,Upgrade from NIS 2003 to NIS2004 - 5 hours and not done...,This Company needs major improvements in the software development for users. I have now spent 5 hours trying to upgrade from NIS 2003 to NIS 2004 and it is full of errors. I can't use my computer until this is fixed.Their support is worthless. This is the 2nd time I tried to get help from their support team and it has been a waste of time.Think twice about upgrading with them unless you are a computer expert or have one to help you when you have problems.
1,Couldn't even install it!,"I had been a McAfee fan up until 2000 when their suite became buggy. So I switched to Norton. Everything was great...until NIS 2004. I have tried to install the software multiple times - unsuccessful. The Symantec website is not the most user-friendly guide for help, plus they want $30 for technical support.I would avoid this program. It is near impossible to install and even worse to get all the embedded registry entries out."
5,The protection you need,"This is a combo pack of Norton's Anti-virus software, personal firewall, and anti-spam programs that are all sold individually as well. The price of buying this complete all-in-one package is a great value. I upgraded from NIS '02- which worked great for me, the '04 version is the latest, improved, and most up to date. I love the easy to use interface and automatic live updates (via the 'net). No computer should ever be connected to the 'net with out protection from viruses, cowardly hackers, and privacy threats. It does it's job, easy to install and use, and most importantly keeps my PC safe. Great product, must have, Highly recommended !!"
2,Don't Buy,"I have had Norton Internet Security for 3 yrs and up graded to 2004 versionin August 2004. Now in October,2004, the firewall said I couldn't OK anymore software to use the internet because its full. Im at full capacity!!!! I called Symantic and they said they don't know why but I should get Tech's Support at $35/hr to help!! I did call them and was on hold for 55 minutes untill I hung up! I am going to buy PC-cillium ASAP. So, DON'T buy this or upgrade."
1,Don't waste your money,"I actually give this product 0 stars. I'm a computter guy, and from the moment that I installed Norton Internet Security Pro 2004 on my computer, it started having problems left and right. I took it off my computer, and was left with a mess on my computer to clean up. Now I am off investigating a new software for internet security.My thinking is that Norton has made the mistake of using it's name to sell their products now, and not a decent product. SO DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!"
1,Don't Buy This Product!,Norton Internet Security 2004 crashed my computer then would not allow me to access it again due to a Windows Protection Error. I was stuck without a computer until I could use someone else's because you can only access help via the Symantec website unless you want to pay $30 per phone call for assistance. Several days later I received a response and it was rude and did not help in the least.
1,WORST Software in the World - Don't Buy,"I installed this software two days ago. Since then, I cannot get into my computer. When I called Norton for help, they want me to pay them an additional $30. They are an unethical company with a terrible product. They wasted hours of my time and my money. Don't buy unless you're a masochist!"
1,I'd say no stars if I could,"I am a faithful Norton user, and am happy with Internet Security 2003, but on upgrading to 2004 (extended download version) my entire Norton program ceased functioning, promting me to uninstall and re install the program. Still trying to figure out what is the best thing to do next."
1,COMES COMPLETE WITH ' NAG SCREENS ',"My Norton Internet Security 2003 with a one year subscription for program live up dates has recently expired. I was considering the purchase of their latest version. Then, about one month before the live update subscription expired, I was and still am, harrassed with nag screens to renew my subscription.After several attempts to contact their technical support I was able to leave a message. I asked them to please tell me how to remove the NAG SCREENS, and their reply was YOU CAN'T !! This answer plus the negative reviews that I've read, have prompted me to not purchase their products and write this review.This review is written to warn you to be aware of their NAG SCREEN PRACTICE to either renew your subcription or remove the program completely from your computer. I can't believe that Symantec could be so inconsiderate, but thats the case!"
1,Could not load the download,"I downloaded this product from their website. Despite doing everything their website said, several times, it would not load. When I called for tech support, they would not provide it unless I paid them. I returned it for a refund, which I hope shows up on my Credit Card soon. I am going to try Mcafee Internet Security, which did not get great ratings either.My big mistake, I should have renewed NIS 2003 instead of trying the upgrade. NIS 2003 was a great product."
1,Internet Security Disaster,"I installed and then reinstalled this trash and have decided to use my previous version of Internet Security. Here are a few reasons why:> There were instances where the Antivirus portion of the software displayed an error indicating that it could not scan the email for viruses.> The Volume Control icon that was in my tray no longer appears.> The Internet Secuity icon will not display in the tray even though the option to make it display is enabled.> My computer takes forever to boot up.> The online help is a joke, just ask a question and you often get an answer that has nothing to do with what you asked.> I refuse to pay for support for a first time installation, Symantec should at least give us some free help for installation.I am sure that this is just the tip of the iceberg, so heaven help you if you buy this trash."
1,NIS 2004 IS WORSE THAN MOST MS VIRUSES,"I implemented it 3 months ago, and last month it started slowing down until it started blocking access to MS Internet Explorer, so I followed the Troubleshooting instructions in their User's Guide, and it still doesn't work.I want my money back, especially since their tech support is totally unresponsive."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!,"I never take the trouble to write online reviews, but after trying this software I feel compelled to. I've been a long time user of symantec software; last year I bought NIS 2003 which gave a (probably false) sense of security after several attacks to my server. And now I made the mistake of paying money for the upgrade. Ang guess what: IT DOESN'T WORK. I don't know what's wrong, but the problem is that the online support at symantec also don't have a clue. Doing research on the web I found that I was not alone, it's not my fault, this product is flawed. Take it from me, save yourself the money, the aggravation, the many late nights trying to figure out the problem and buy something else."
1,"If there was 0 stars, I'd give it a 0","I will keep this brief for the impulse shoppers. I installed it, and its liveupdate continued to get errors. It was a hassle to uninstall. It drastically affected my programs and games (so much lag and choppiness). It's a system hog. If it was free, I would not use it. Imagine that. NOrton , I emphasize the NO in NOrton. Also, I have two friends that had to format their hard drives after installing this garbage. I had one friend who physically corrupted his hard drive because he would have to hit the power switch when Norton locked his system up."
1,Piece of CRAP,"After wasting a whole Saturday trying to undo what this crap did to a computer and getting nowhere decent and finally just giving up, I was horrified to learn a cousin of mine had purchased said product as well and was having all kinds of troubles too and this was after he paid 200 to BEST BUY to fix it. What the heck kind of product is put out to make computers not even function? This kind of sleaze needs to be taken to court. And they charge 20 bucks for a customer service call after they wreck your computer. Give me a break! Don't buy this GARBAGE! BOYCOTT THESE FOOLS!"
1,Faulty product -DO NOT BUY!,"Norton have introduced a technically faulty Product Activation system into this product. According to their help files, they know this doesn't work on some laptops & they don't know why. So until they fix the mistake they introduced in a feature which is only for their financial benefit, we customers have to just use the Internet unprotected. I bought this product 3 weeks ago, and have wasted hours trying to find a solution.I plan to demand a refund.REPEAT: THIS IS FAULTY SOFTWARE - DO NOT BUY."
1,Avoid this like the plague,"Do NOT buy this product. It hosed up my brand-new, out-of-the-box, no-other-software-installed, system big time... wouldn't let me install or un-install it or any other program; trashed my internet access; and wouldn't run itself properly. I tried (several times) the 8 or 9 different possible manual solutions offered on the Symantec web site to fix or remove the software (an indicator of how bad this software is)... to no avail. After a complete re-format and re-install of XP Pro and AFTER HAVING TO PAY VIA THE 900 Symantec ""SUPPORT"" NUMBER (they won't help for free)I am finally rid of this piece of crap. The online tech (at the per-minute charge) admitted that they have lots of disgruntled customers and unresolved problems.DO NOT BUY this program (or Norton Anti-Virus which caused similar problems)... go with McAfee or another vendor instead..."
1,NIS 2004 - Total Garbage,Without repeating all the problems reported by other reviewers (I have experienced most of them and more) suffice it to say that amazon should take this off of their shelf and refuse to sell it. It is utter and complete garbage - I have never seen any software that behaves so poorly or is so poorly supported. Symantec / Norton should be ashamed of this product and should send a refund to all users of it.
2,Uninstall/reinstall,"I am fed up with uninstalling and reinstalling this product evry time there's a problem. Before I buy the next edition (2005), I'm going to have to get some assurance that it has a LOT fewer glitches and is more stable."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE,"I have had good luck with previous purchases of Antivirus but unfortunately this package is one to stay away from if you use Eudora or do not wish to use Norton's AntiSpam. Norton even admits that it has ""problems"" with Eudora but still advertises it's compatibility. The worst part is you cannot select the software package to install/uninstall. I either have to deal with AntiSpam screwing up my system so I can keep the firewall and antivirus or remove them all. I tried to get my money back 4-month's ago because of this and still haven't been credited. I doubt I will ever be credited for downloading this unbelievably bad software and trying to get help is impossible.I will no longer purchase a Symantec software again."
2,Doesn' t get along with Eudora and other Norton products,"1. Nullify Eudora's effective junk filter feature, even when Norton's AntiSpam is disabled;2. Poor integration with earlier Norton installation with separate control consoles. Some items on the earlier one stop working;3. Fire the ones who are responsible for the intrusive activation feature that makes uninstallation impossible."
2,Watch out for NIS 2004,"NIS 2004 has a very buggy install.I had Norton Firewall 2003 and NAV 2003 on 2 machines, both running XP Home. I was very happy with the 2003 products.The NIS install on the first machine, while constantly interrupted and restarted, eventually worked. It is up and (I hope) running - at least NIS says it's running.I bought a second copy of NIS for the second machine. The install on the second machine played out every problem listed here. Man, what a lousy install - you'd think Symantec would have cobbled together a patch product by now. I went back to Personal Firewall 2003 with updates ($15), and bought McAfee antivirus. So far, that combo is working fine.I would not buy NIS 2004. Stick with upgrading the Symantec 2003 products - but even then you have to be careful which live updates you choose to install. 4 stars for working once (with bugs), no stars for the second install - average 2 stars."
3,Now i'm really uncertain of norton 2004........,"originally, i had huge problems with norton antivirus 2004. However, using NIS2004, with only the firewall and parental controls installed, it does NOT slow down my PC. I've been using an old version of Symantec AntiVirus Corporate instead of NAV2004, which I'm still afraid of, but this product is better than I had first thought....Maybe those having the biggest problems just don't know how to handle a PC, or maybe they download too many (illegal) things and have too many problems with their PC already."
1,Avoid this like the Plaque,"AVOID THIS PRODUCT.It does not work. Once you install it, only a clean reinstall from format will have your computer working again.I installed it on a P4 3GHz, and it continually crashed and failed.I am a technical professional, and have used many, many software packages. This one is terrible, and will cause you more headaches than it will save.DO NOT PURCHASE!"
4,Seems ok to us (could use better firewall alerts & docs),"No problems installing NIS 2004 on HP Pavilion (P4 @ 1.8 with XP, and while NAV 2002 was loaded). First time with a firewall app, but used NAV for many years. PC now takes slightly longer to start XP (logical, since it is loading an extra app). Occasionally the firewall alerts can be annoying to decipher (e.g. NIS reported our PC as the intruder), but NAV and LiveUpdate seem to be running fine. Antispam feature seems to be 85-90% effective, but occasionally declares war on MS-Outlook inbox rules. Haven't tried to use the parental control. Overall, NIS 2004 does the job (however, Symantec should read the other reviews, as it seems many people do not share this opinion)."
1,Too much that can't do enough right,"Too bad the product is cumbersome and intertwined trying to do so much at one time. Sometimes a suite is not a good deal and all you get is a bundle of headaches.I found I was better off with ZoneAlarm Pro as my firewall and Norton Antivirus 2004 as my first line of defense against intruders, viruses and Trojans. Supplement it with Ad-aware and Pest Patrol, be religious about scanning your system on a regular basis and you should be free of any problems.And if you let your kid's surf the web on your PC, run the firewall and antivirus with the highest protection setting available."
1,SLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Norton Internet Security 2004 is an UN-USEABLE product. Internet activities that took 3 seconds prior to NIT '04 now take upwards of 60 to 90 seconds.I wouldn't have believed that a product could slow my internet usage so much. I tried to use it for a few days but had to un-install.And; worst of all; there is NO number or contact addresss to ask for help. You buy this incredibly poor product and you are stuck with it.How do I get my money back?SAH
1,Will never buy another Norton product again!,"All they ever do is mess up my pc. If you ever try uninstalling it, watch out!. Want tech support? Be will to pay some cash for it. As far as Antivirus Im sticking with Kaspersky, and Firewall OutPost Pro. They are both better products and dont use the product activation junk."
3,Full featured but heavy running,"This is a very full featured product. It checks every 5 minutes for virus and spam definition updates. Also, with one click you can help train your spam killer. And the firewall came with a wizard which made it effortless to configure it to my LAN.So it is with deep regrets that I uninstalled this program. I think I would have loved it if it did not slow down my machine so much. Relatedly, the burden on Windows 98 resources is huge. Unfortunately, one of my older programs necessary to my business would not even run. (It requires a high percent of windows resources to operate.)I'm going back to just running Norton Antivirus, and using my router software for a firewall, google to block pop-ups, and dealing with spam the best I can with my ISP.Maybe at some time in the future I will be able to run this program, but Windows 98 resource limitations, my computer, and my existing software make doing so now impossible."
1,Stick With Norton 2003...Ugh,"Okay, how can I say this nicely? This product is absolutely not ready for release. It is buggy, slow and basically frustrates the heck out of the user. I am an IT professional and have used Norton for years, but this product is a complete and utter dud.I just bought a new computer so I figured I would install the new Norton with the new system. Bad idea. My new computer which clocks at twice the rate of my old system is SLOWER than my old system when using Norton 2004. Also, I despise software activation. Microsoft already treats us like criminals, but we have little choice there. With Norton we can fight back because we have many alternatives.Bottom line? Save your money. Look for copys of Norton 2003 or simply buy an alternative. This product signals the decline of Symantec and the Norton line."
1,HORRID AND AWFUL -----DO NOT BUY THIS,"I bought and installed this before reading these reviews...OMFG, DO NOT BUY THIS! This is the most god-awful program ever. It installed just fine, until I tried to use it..I cant even get to the options screen on it, live update does not work, re-installed it a couple times, still doesnt work. Now, it won't un-install, so I will have to do it manually. This is the biggest pile of *CRAP* I have ever seen. Norton also charges 30$ if you want tech support, btw. I didn't do that, but now have to wait 8 weeks to get a refund. I will never buy from norton ever again. Nor should you. Go mcafree or panda."
2,Do some research before purchasing,"Before installing anything on your computer, you need to do a bit of research before spending the money. This is definitely one of those products, especially as the company is leaning more towards making a profit.Unlike the other reviewers, I had no problem installing Norton Internet Security. The trouble came when I used it. A few days after installing, a hijacker got in through the security, and I lost all ability to use my browser. According to the reports, some viruses were quarantined, which causes my other virus check to keep telling about it. As others noted, tech help is really non-existent unless you want to pay for it, and help does not come cheap.If you use a dial-up Internet service, this program will bring your movement to a crawl. The program appears to check everything, which means that just loading a basic page (like this site) takes too long to be practical.Do your research before buying this program."
1,Slow and Slower ...,"After installing Norton Internet Security 2004 on XP Home, I noticed each day the access to web pages was getting slower and slower. After about a week it was unusable. I uninstalled and reinstalled and it seemed OK again until another week went by. I also noticed a bug in Norton Anti-Spam when you have multiple accounts on XP. Each time you attempt to use Outlook after another account has accessed it, you will get a C++ runtime error which terminates Outlook ... a second try will work and all goes well until another account tries to use Outlook. I have been a loyal Norton product user for many years ... but I have uninstalled it and am looking elsewhere."
1,Complete rip off,"I installed the Internet Security Suite a week ago and have had nothing but problems ever since. After many lost hours and reinstalled programs I've had to disable the email filtering (it freezes everytime its on and doesn't import my entire address book). And I'm only having to perform a hard reboot about once a day verses 10+. The only reason I haven't done an uninstall is that I'm hoping Norton will continue 'learning' until it isn't a total pain in the (*&(%. Plus, I'd be out all my shipping if I returned it. Plus, I'd have to drive to the post office......I absolutely hate this product but I like their virus software. I think it's much better than McAfree."
1,BEWARE OF INSTALLING THIS PRODUCT,"I INSTALLED THIS PRODUCT AND LOST MY DSL INTERNET CONNECTION FOR OVER FIVE HOURS WHILE A FRIEND OF MINE HELPED GET IT BACK. NORTON IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM WITH DSL BECAUSE THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO DOWNLOAD TO TRY TO PREVENT IT, BUT THEIR DOWNLOAD DOES NOT WORK. THEIR VIRUS PRODUCT IS FINE, BUT THIS PRODUCT IS A MENACE."
1,Where's the -5 choice?,"This software is horrible. Heed the other reviewers' advice and don't buy this thing. I installed it four times and got several error messages every time. I just spent THREE hours with Dell reinstalling and reformatting my hard drive. It's not worth it! Don't bother, NAV 2003 works just fine!"
1,2004 IS CRAP - stick with 2003,"I have loved norton products for years, and did not blink and eye at buying the latest version of NIS - and so began the week of HELL. I have to agree with all the other negative comments reviewing this product, this product is a NIGHTMARE and was definitely prematurely released. I am an IT professional, and at this point I have spent over 18 hours troublshooting the product, installing, removing, reinstalling (9 times now), online support, emailing support, paying for tech support (who incidently did nothing more than have me uninstall, clean out the registry entries, and reinstall) even to the point of reformatting the harddrive - TWICE. This product was not ready for release. Stick with NIS2003, its stable, 2004 is not."
1,Total disaster,"What a horrid mess. Did the people at Norton ever try to installthis ! Or see how it runs....I think not !!!!!It locks up the computer, screws up explorer, deletes drivers,the list goes on. How can a company dump a defective productlike this on the market ? The only good thing about this product is the 60 day refund offered on the Norton website. Anyonewho has purchased NIS04 should get damages for pain and suffering too. Yuck.....Minus stars."
1,Beware of Norton!!,"I had the best intentions when I bought this, I really did. I followed the instructions to the letter. But it caused more headaches than I could imagine. Stay away from this product! I don't know what's happened to Norton, but 2004 is absolute garbage. Apparently, they can't even fix the bugs that have overrun their own site. The customer support is pathetic."
1,Don't use this software,"Please listen to others -- this software is horrible. It ran all right for me for 2 months then started getting buggy. The severe problems began when I tried to uninstall it -- you can not get this off your system. Norton's website has lengthy instructions involving several approaches to uninstalling including editing the registry -- what crap. Don't waste your money. Go to Norton's website and do a search using ""uninstall and reinstall"". If you use this junk you will regret it. I had to offload all data and do full reformat and reinstallation of Windows XP to clean up my system. Wasted 2 days screwing around."
1,System resource hog on Win98 - avoid this program,"I have used a variety of Norton products on a 450 mhz Dell since 1999 without a problem, but NIS 2004 rendered my computer unusable. This program grabbed all system resources and would cause a system resource error within 10 minutes of startup each and every time. I followed their generally useless 'support' advice ; uninstalled/reinstalled many times and did everything I could to free up system resources all to no avail. Finally I left NIS 2004 uninstalled. My computer instantly began to function normally EXCEPT that i cannot go back and put NIS 2002 back on. NIS 2002 did work fine (it was the anti-spam that lured me to 2004), but absolutely will not work on a machine polluted by NIS 2004. I've tried cleaning the registry, but no luck. Anyway, on to try PC-illin. Symantec has lost another customer forever."
2,Get NIS 2003 instead,NIS2004 requires product activation. This will prevent you from installing this software on multiple computers. I think the NIS2003 product is just as good (maybe even better) and does not require the hassle of product activation.I would recommend that anyone thinking of NIS2004 to buy NIS2003 instead.
1,Another program that doesn't trust the buyer,You'd think after Intuit gigantic flop with product activation that other software companies like Symantec would have learned something. I guess not. After using Norton Antivirus year after year (upgrading versions at least 3 times) I will have to look for another anti-virus vendor now.
1,Is there a 1- ?,I have been sitting here for hours trying to install. Thank god for the other reviews or I ignorantly might have installed the thing from Symantec which would mess with my registry. The dang disc is going back!!!!
1,Best Feature? 60-Day Money Back Guarantee,"Email in Outlook Express flat out stopped working after install. I have uninstalled and returning product after hours of lost time. Can't believe we put up with this type of service in this day and age. If you buy this product, hope that you have 0 issues. Online help is worthless and to talk to tech support is $29.95 a pop!!! That's 1/3 to 1/2 the price of the product. Symantec does not even give one chance free.Never again. Thank goodness for 60-day return policy."
2,"Product Gets 4 Stars, Symantec Gets ZERO","Bought a ""boxed"" copy of NIS 2004 and installed it on an XP Pro machine without a hitch. Product has not given me any problems in the 4 months that it has been installed.Now, Symantec is another story. If you think you're getting a rebate -- forget it. I have submitted two separate ""proof of previous purchase"" articles, including the CD-R from my old version. After 3 months my status on their system is ""No Reward Will Be Issued, Missing Proof of Previous Purchase"". There is, of course, no way to contact them to clear this up. Sadly, they are living down to their notorious customer service reputation."
1,Gets worse with each new release,"What was once the best product of its kind has turned into true bloatware that slows down your PC and causes assorted other problems. On top of that, it has very restrictive activation requirements and Symmantec support is non-existance beyond the carefully censored stuff on their website. My copy went back.Do yourself a favor, boycott Symantec until they figure out they're headed in the wrong direction."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!,"This was the worst piece of software I have ever purchased. It locked up my PC during installation, was a nightmare to try to run, and has been impossible to remove(and I work with computers for a living!)-Symantec's instructions were useless and their customer support is non-existent. Until it is removed completely, it can't be reinstalled and it can't be removed..so it's in a virtual loop. Don't make the same expensive and frustrating mistake that I made..avoid this product!!"
1,"NIS 2004 (Gets 1 star, deserves NONE or minus 300)","Excuse me, but what is that smell? Oh yeah, it is NIS 2004, the foul stench of a failure. I bought this crap, TRIED to install it....a disaster in it's own right..can you say REFORMAT.Needless to say this garbage ware is sitting on top of my garbage can...right where it belongs, I will take the 70 dollar loss, and NEVER buy another Norton product again, If you are sure you must have NIS 2004, I'd advise getting it from KaZaA, even then, if it doesn't work, you are not out 70 bucks. If it is cracked properly it will work like a charm :-) DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP SOFTWARE, NORTON IS THE VIRUS, THE ""HACKERS"" YOU ALL FEAR ARE NOT THE ENEMY, THESE SOFTWARE COMPANYS ARE...""HACKERS"" READ YOUR FILES, BIG BUSINESS STEALS YOUR MONEY...PICK YOUR POISON!!"
1,This product filters all pro gun website including the NRA!,"It's good to see that Symantec is looking out for us all by not letting any website in that might be pro-gun. This includes the NRA. But if you want to read all about the anti-gun websites you can browse to your hearts content. Since when does anyone want to buy security software that tries to force its political views down our throats. No thanks Symantec. I won't be buying anything you make, ever again!"
1,Crashes frequently with Windows 2000,"I had been using Symantec Anti-virus for years and when it came time to renew they offered the opportunity to ""upgrade"" to Internet Security I bought based on how pleased with the base anti-virus program. What a disappointment! It crashed my Windows 2000 system like it was a demolition derby! The recommended fix, changing the IRPStackSize, did nothing to stop the crashes. I ended up disabling it and I won't renew again."
1,What a Mess!,"I have installed NIS 2004 on 2 computers as an upgrade of NIS 2003. Both installations failed and on one it somehow was set up without ""administrator"" privileges and cannot be accessed to turn the Internet Security on!! And it will not allow me to uninstall without the ""adminstrator"" so I will have to reformat before I can reconnect to Internet.Both installations suffered ""corrupted update lists"" therefore would not update properly, but on the second computer I was able to uninstall and go back to NIS 2003 which always seemed to be a very good program.I have spent many hours trying to sort this out but am simply not prepared to give Symantec $30 to fix THEIR problem!!"
1,They should be sued!,This has to be the worst software I've ever used. My Outlook is all messed up. I regret ever having upgraded. Ugh.
1,Don't buy !!! - - - Confusing and unclear interface,"-- This is worst user interface I ever used.-- When full system virus check is complete(after very long scan) it lists 'at risk' file and you must make decision to delete or skip. And you can't go back to change your mind. And once you delete the file, it gives you option to 'Exclude' or 'Skip'. I don't know what helps at this point. This software is useless and confusing. Most of time, it failed to delete adwares and there's no further instruction to delete such files.---------- I do not recommend this software at all ----------------"
1,WORST PROGRAM EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is the worst program ever made. 2003 version was so much better...DON'T BUY IT!!!!!
3,why,I would like to know what it takes to get through to you people.I have just installed a 2004 antivirus from norton.The autoprotect is disabled. I cant seem to enable it.I use your e-mailaddress doesnt go through why If you can get this service enabled i would appriciate it.I DONT KNOW HOW TO RATE YOURPRODUCT YET.I do know how to rate getting your correct e-mailaddress and service dept so far ZERObumper@microserve.net
1,Don't Buy This,This is the worse piece of software I have ever installed on my computer. Don't waste your money or time.
1,Do not use Norton Internet Security,"Norton Antivirus is an excellent software. It deletes viruses and worms at hight reliability if Liveupdate is on. But Norton Internet Security may severely disturb the usage of the web: it blocks content which should not be blocked and the criteria used to detect so called promotional content are weak: imagine you including a JavaScript source menu.js on your homepage. It works. Then rename the file and the html code to banner.js. It's blocked. Seen on studmed.unibe.ch. Or: pictures are blocked only because of their size. Seen on maarsen.ch/imaktu.htmWell, do not use Norton Internet Security but activate your Windows-XP-Firewall. It is simple, reliable, low ressource consuming, already integrated and therefore for free."
1,Wow. The 1-stars are CORRECT.,"I agree with everything that the other 1-star people are saying. I wish there was a NO star rating. WAAAAAY too many compatibility issues, and when I tried to go to online help, it gave me a million popups asking me if it should permit symantec to access the internet? Sh-DUH it should!PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT.IT IS BAD.VERY, VERY, BAD."
1,CHECK OUT OTHER 'USER' REVIEWS FIRST,"Check not only this site, but other 'User Review' sites regarding this product - 80% or more EXTREMELY NEGATIVE. Even if the reviews were more positive, do NOT buy ANY Symantec Product UNLESS YOU WILL NEVER HAVE A NEED FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE - THERE IS NONE! I have just spent 4 hours AFTER HAVING PAID for my firewall SUBSCRIPTION RENEWAL trying to get my renewal activated. After going through 15 menus on-line to try and email customer service, I was given a form. I entered the info. When I finally got an email response, it had nothing to do with my question, then told me if it didn't help, I would have to REPEAT THE ENTIRE ON-LINE Process! I then called their ""Customer Service"" line - PUT ON HOLD FOR 30 MINUTES! Finally had to redo renewal by phone without answer to question. This is typical of ANY NORTON PRODUCT CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD!"
1,Stay off the Norton downhill runaway train,"I have read the installation instructions for both NIS 2004 and NAV 2004 prior to installation, but still ended up with the same result...junk software. Why is it that I can install any other type of software and it installs and works properly? But if I installed either one of these Norton products, neither works after installation? It can not be the computer or the owner, since I purchased McAfee Anti-Virus 8 and it installs and works fine with no problems. I have used Norton for the past 5 years and for the last 2 years, the software has gotten more and more disgraceful. I am glad that I do not work for Norton."
3,Horrible Customer Support,I had a problem uninstalling Norton Internet Security 2003 so I had to contact Symantec. The only two choices were to call an 800 # that costs $29.95 or a 900 # that cost $2.95 a minute I took the gamble that my problem could be solved in less than 10 minutes to save money. Luckily it only took 3 minutes but still cost me almost $10.What a racket. On principal alone I will not be purchasing a product from Symantec again.
1,run away as fast as you can,"This software out and out sucks. I installed it, I could see it on the desktop, I could see it on the hard drive, I could see it in the task bar. I could not open it. I could doubleclick all day long and nothing would happen.I went on to the Symantec web site, got caught in that circle, and it was useless. Found out the NIS 2004 was not supported, unless it was the ""pro"" version. This from the Symantec website itself. Shame, shame, shame on Symantec for putting out such a poor product.It took 5 minutes to download and install Trendmicro Pc-cillin. Worked perfectly the very first time. Guess where my money is going now. Should have taken the $70.00 I spent on NIS 2004 and gone to the casino, I could've gotten a better return.Of course I probably could have had Symantec tech support fix it.............for a fee........FOR A FEE!!!!!!!"
1,I'll never buy another Norton product,"This was awful. The first time after I loaded it, I could not enable it -- it kept saying I did not have necessary privileges to enable it or to change the settings.After reloading it and spending about 8 hours on it, I finally had it installed and apparently working. Then I tried using the internet. I cannot get a single site without dis-enabling the software. It is either so slow it keeps timing out, or else it just does not want to let it through.But the worst part is they do not support their own product -- to call is $30, so I did not call. The on-line support is not very helpful. Isn't giving adequate support part of the cost of buying a new computer product?Best to get something else. I am thinking of scrapping the whole thing, counting it as a loss, and getting something else."
4,Sea shanties at their best,This is a vinyl album I have had in my collection since around 1970. I don't know if Freddy is still recording but at the time of this album he posessed a resonant voice particularly suited to the shanties presented here. Sung in German this is an album that I have enjoyed for many years and will now be able to continue to enjoy.For lovers of traditional seafaring songs this is a must.
3,A nice work that doesn't communicate,"Those readers that are suspicious of the methodological foundations of modern economics will definitely find a lot of interesting material in Lawson's book. There is no doubt that Lawson's work (which is a product of more than 10 years of research at Cambridge) is deep and raises fundamental questions. One big problem, however, is that the book assumes that the reader has a substantial amount of knowledge about philosophy of science and this is surely not the case as far as the ""representative"" economist is concerned. Too bad. Lawson's message deserves to be made available to a larger audience. This would only be accomplished, however, if Lawson had chosen to cut the amount of philosophical blah-blah-blah and give more direct to the point examples of what he has in mind. He preferred to demonstrate his erudition, though."
5,Do not read and drive!,"It may be tempting, but my experience with reading this book and operating a motor vehicle came out badly. There was a red light and obviously the book was good enough that putting it down to go twelve blocks was unthinkable, but it ended up being decidedly unpleasant for myself and all involved. I would suggest carving out a couple of hours where you don't need to leave the house for this hilarious mock epic about one man's quest to regain his erection."
2,For classic scholars only,"Can't beat the price for the Kindle version, but if this is latin comedy (as it was billed), give me Abbott and Costello."
4,Loved this book!,"For whatever reason, I love Marion Zimmer Bradley's books - love reading about the Goddess, love reading about pre Christian UK, etc. Some of the books though, are a bit violent, all the feuding, etc. This book warmed my heart. Enjoyed her version of how Atlantis ""ended"". Loved reading about the red and white spring in the ""summer country"". Talked about how Stonehenge came into being. Talked about the maze on the Tor. Made me remember the wonderful times I've had at the Chalice well and on the Tor. Some very nice hymns, chants,etc. Enjoyed Tiriki and Micail. Good read for me. Sorry when it ended."
4,I'm glad I read it but...,"As other reviewers have said this book does not do MZB justice. however I have read other books where MZB was not the only writer and felt I new what to expect.For me I loved the book. It is true for several other books that I have read that once I get into a series I want to read everything in it, no matter how good it really was I still find myself enjoying the book.It is true MZB is greatly missed and while I have read others In search of her likeness and still cannot find one. Of course I do not have as much time as I would like to read. Does anyone have any recommendations? I'm reading MZB's Sword and Sorceress novels now in hopes of finding new authors."
1,i truly wanted to love this book,"as a fan of the mists i was anticipating a great read. i have loved the past books, although The Mists remains my all time favorate. this book was tedious to read. had a rating less than one star been available i would have taken it. as much as i have loved the series it is time to drop the cord and allow it to be complete as it stood before the 'ancestors' of avalon was released. This book does NOT deserve to be included in the saga."
2,delivery ruins the cover,"The description of the product was for the large paper-back version of this book. However, when the book arrived, it was a hard-cover with a smashed corner and torn cover."
4,Loved the connections,"I always knew that the Atlantis book was part of the Avalon books - and this book links the two. Although not an extremely remarkable story, I enjoyed reading it. I liked seeing how things from later books were worked out and also how history was placed into the book (such as the building of Stonehenge)."
4,Another Adventure to Avalon,"I enjoyed the book very much, unfortunatly MZB wasnt around to write the book in completion herself you can still see her sense of style throughout the entire book... Although it wasn't her best work I am always willing to dive into another adventure in avalon."
2,Ancestors of Avalon,I am glad I read Ancestors of Avalon even though it lacked the magic of MZB's previous books.It wasn't true to MZB's style.I am sorry to say that DP didn't do it justice.I felt disconnected from the characters.Some of the wording and phrases didnot flow for me.I will cherish MZB's Avalon saga and put this book on the shelf next to the rest.Thanks Ms.Paxson for trying to fill such big shoes.Eldri
3,SO SO,"Well, I can tell you that Marion Zimmer Bradley may have started to write this book....or had the idea of writing it, but Diana Paxon is not, and never will match the gift that Marion Zimmer Bradley had with words and story craft.I couldn't get into it...I may finish it one day. Then again, maybe not."
3,Took a long time to read,"I had read all of MZB's books and got through them very quickly -- they were all so delightful to read -- books you could not just put down. Then, I read this one. While it was not an ""awful"" book like some reviewers say, it did take a LONG time to get through.It was a complicated story and I had to reread some parts several times to understand what was being said or going on.No, it may not be a true MZB book, but it was a decent read, if you have a lot of time."
3,Not MZB but a decent read,"I have read "" The Mists"" at least twice in the past 20 years, enjoyed as well ""The Forest House"" and ""Lady of Avalon"" and the story and characters are imprinted in my heart. Recently I came upon ""The Fall of Atlantis"" and although the amount of characters in such a small book was rather overwhelming, I managed to love and understand each of them as only MZB can make you do.""Ancestors of Avalon"" connects MZB's Atlantis story to Avalon and makes us believe that both places did actually exist. Diana L Paxson has her own style and takes a little getting used to on the heels of a MZB read. I had to console myself once or twice at her usage of modern vernacular that totally shocked me out of this wonderful world of the ancient past. All in all it was an entertaining visit to places that could have been real and an interesting method of weaving the two stories to each other, and to present day."
3,"It was good, BUT, It could have been better!","This book did explain some things, but honestly? It could have been much better. If you're just getting into the Avalon books, this should probably be the last one you read, and not the first. The Mists Of Avalon should be your first one.Also, before you read this, you should really read The Fall Of Atlantis... The reason I say that is because it makes things SO much clearer. It makes things easier to understand ""How on earth did they GET to this? What did they do to cause this?"" It explains that and much more....The ending definately could have been better, and if they would have made the book longer, and included more history of Avalon and Atlantis."
1,Ancestors of Avalon Should Have Stayed Buried In The Past!,"When I learned that a new installment in the Avalon series was published, I was thrilled. ""The Mists of Avalon"" is one of my favorite novels and I have read all of Bradley's other novels in the series. Diana L. Paxson who collaberated with Bradley on one of the Avalon books, decided to take on the prequal and link Bradley's Avalon series with Bradley's Atlantis novel. She should have left both alone.Paxson cannot write. I would go as far as to call her work drivvel. It was terrible. The chacters were unsympathetic and hollow. They contained no substance whatsoever and as a reader I could not connect with them. Their speech was all wrong as well. Paxson had the characters swearing and using modern day slang! The whole novel was contrived, poorly written and not at all inline with Bradley's previous writings.I cannot advise anyone to read this novel, it was so poor."
3,3 stars for some effort,"I'm a huge MZB fan, so I had to get this. I'm really discouraged by Paxon's work. The effort to make a storyline was a good one, the result was not.There are too many characters and it's difficult to tell them apart, they're so similiar! Part of the cast ends up in one place, the other in another. While there is a list of characters and a brief, one-line description at the beginning of the novel, it's just not nearly enough. I was reading about one girl, and I was asking myself, ""Who is this? Elara? Cleta? Damisa?"" They're really that indistinguishable.The characters are also very static. The good ones do No Wrong. the bad ones are Suspects From the Start. What I enjoyed about MZB's books is that the characters were like real people--they made some bad choices, some good, some totally uncomprehensible.AoA does explain the transition from Sun-worship (masculine) to Moon-worship (feminine), and I'll give Paxton credit for that."
1,Insufferable,"Out of loyality to Marion Zimmer Bradley's masterpiece ""The Mists of Avalon"", I really tried very hard to get into this book. But among the cheesy dialog, one-dimensional cardboard characters, and the author's annoyingly constant use of points of ellipsis -- forget it. I forced myself to get to page 174 (because of the money I spent on this) and decided I'm not going to torture myself anymore. Time would have been better spent reading ""Mists"" for the fourth time instead. Paxton's novel is an insult to Bradley's legacy."
3,Disappoitingly average,"This book could have been much better if it had been longer, perhaps. With such a large cast of characters we needed more time with them to really care. But years flit by between chapters, and everyone ends up looking the same by the end."
2,Disjointed narrative makes for tough sledding,"There's lot of spy vs. spy folklore here but it's presented in a format that really jumps around, making it unnecessarily confusing. The story of the CIA's operations in Afghanistan could have made a separate book and doesn't fit with the rest of the more familiar spy games. In fact, that book has already been written- Ghost Wars, the Pulitzer-Prize winner by Steve Coll. It seems like Bearden wasn't sure whether he wanted to write an autobiography or a history of CIA operations."
3,"OK book, can be boring at times","This is written less like a story and more like a history book. The language is usually dry and factual, and not structured in a storybook way (i.e. often you are told the outcome of a particular anecdote at the beginning, so the rest isn't exciting and/or mysterious). If you are a history buff, you'd probably like it, otherwise it's kind of interesting but not as enjoyable as I thought it would be."
1,for the cheep detective story lover,This reads like a Tom Clancy novel only cheep. We have seen this story before in many spy movies. There is little substance and a lot of editorializing (which I thought was a bit heavy on the US side). At one point the author tells us the CIA boss was so wonderful even the KGB studied him for his professionalism. PLEASE!!!
5,The Garfield Secrecy,"Fast Paced, Exciting Action! This novel is thrilling from beginning to end! The suspense was balanced just enough to elicit the appropriate relief responses at various intervals from the reader. The good guys are easy to love; even if they drink too much and are slighty unethical. The bad guys are immediately hated to the point one wants to jump into the action and give a helping hand to the heroes.....From beginning to end the weave of fidelity between the ""Garfield House"" men is most refreshing; rather a novelty in this modern day and age."
4,Good extension reading for my higher level students,"Although the text was too short and didn't provide my advanced language arts students with enough information, it did inspire them to investigate each of the topics further. It is a good starting point for learning. I don't agree with all of the theories in the book."
5,Awesome brush!,"Oooh, is this an awesome toothbrush! It really does massage your gums as you brush - I've never felt anything like it. It's just incredible, especially since I have sensitive, bleeding gums and most brushes just irritate my mouth. This one doesn't do any of that - just massages as you brush. Great, great product -wish it had been out years ago! Highly, highly, highly recommend!"
1,"Believe the reviews, pass on this one. YUCK!","I want to thank the prior reviews for saving me words. This movie is not worth the time, or waste of time I should say. There are many good family films out there competing for your time, so keep moving when you see this title. Yes, the acting is not great, nor the overacting. Movies like this make me question why some directors bother with them, and further, put it on DVD when many good movies have not been released on DVD. I try to give every film a chance to redeem itself, even if it takes a little longer than I expect. But this one had me hitting the stop button and reaching for another DVD."
2,There are better kids' movies out there,"Unless you're a hardcore Robert Carradine fan or a collector of flicks from obscure child actors, like Evan Bonifant, save your money and buy something else. The story is cheesy, full of inconsistencies and things that just don't make sense, a vehicle for playground political propaganda (evil oil companies, ""eco-warriors"", and foster care woes). The characters are two-dimensional and the acting was practically phoned in. Evan Bonifant had some untapped potential as an actor, and it's a shame it was wasted on bargain-bin flicks like Breakout."
3,Don't Call Me Bugsy DVD,"He was handsome. He was glamorous.And in a seedy underworld of ruthless murderers,he was the most vicious of them all.This DVD presents an up-close look at the mobster who lived his life at nothing short of full-throttle. Examine Siegel's greatest lagacy as the founding father of glittering Las Vegas,Nevada.Having traveled to Las Vegas during the 70's 80's 90's I am very interested in the history of the town.Bugsy Siegel played a major roll in developing Las Vegas to what it has become today.I viewed part of this movie on one of the cable channels and decided tom purchase a copy.I search the net to found the best price and delivery at Amazon and purchase a copy for my home library.I would recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in the History of Las Vegas."
5,Mysterious affair at Styles,A great read. Loved the characters. Agatha Christie is still a great mystery writer and her stories are still interesting years after she wrote them.
1,Flawed Kindle Edition,This review applies only to the Kindle edition.There are illustrations which are essential to the plot and referenced in the text. They are missing from this edition. I had to find another copy in order to finish the book. Very disappointed in the lack of quality in this release.
4,Poirot's Delightful Debut,"This is Poirot's first case and Christie's debut as a mystery writer. It is an auspicious start to a brilliant career for both the author and her creation. It's a bit over-ambitious; the young Christie was heavy-handed with the clues in this one, and while the ending is a surprise, the last section of the book is just a bit too long for the ending to have quite the impact that Christie would achieve in later works. This is perhaps the only Christie book about which one can say there are ""too many clues;"" it is nonetheless an astounding achievement for a first-time author. And, of course, any fan of Poirot will want to read the case that ""started it all."""
3,Great Book -Lousy Edition,"The novel itself is a classic and a masterpiece. That said, you should pony up for a better edition. Simply put, the novel includes several diagrams and reproductions of handwritten notes -which are not included in this Kindle edition. So, you pretty much have to get a copy of the physical book, or do without important clues to the solution of the mystery. I have read other Kindle books which include diagrams, drawings, etc., so it can easily be done. This particular publisher/editor didn't bother, and the result is a less-than-satisfactory reading experience. Five stars for the novel; 1 star for the Kindle edition."
4,Lots of fun,"Agatha Christie doesn't disappoint if you want to read a clean story that keeps you guessing. It isn't suspenseful, but it is a fun read that is hard to put down."
4,Pretty good read,"liked it in general, but not one of my favourite books. Poirot is very different from Sherlock Holmes. Kept me guessing till the last chapter. The quaint charm of English aristocracy was also refreshing to imagine. Recommend for a lazy afternoon"
4,Old classic,"I read the book a long time ago. I haven't actually re-read it this time, but I looked through it; there are too many books to keep re-reading stuff. It's fun to re-encounter Poirot and Hastings."
3,Not the best Agatha book,"I am a big Agatha fan (have read at least 20 of her books), but I am sorry to say this one is not the best. The story is a little too stilted, with some irrelevant elements thrown in just to ""cloud the situation"". Not as tightly woven as her later works. Of course, this being one of her early books, one must read with a level of tolerance and understanding; and it being the first one that introduces Poirot, it still is a must-read for the true Agatha/Poirot fans. Her later books, Murder on the Orient Express, Death on the Nile, Death in the Clouds, etc. are more well-constructed and a lot more fun to read."
4,"""...the colossal cheek of the little man!""",...I got a hunch about 1/2 way through that one of the characters was the murderer - but could not even begin to see how they did it or were connected. My first read of a Christie book - and I'll be digging in to others since I enjoyed this one so much.
3,Not predictable end,This is very interesting and dinamic book you read breathless.In this complicated story the end is un-predictable.Strongly recomendations.
4,A SUCCESSFUL START,i m a 15 year old girl .i own 22 books of agatha christie including mysterious affair at styles and murder on the links which were her first and second books of hercule poirot.in this book agatha christie has taken every reader by the nose and leaded right to the wrong track.everypage is fascinating once u start reading it u cant put the book down.
5,One of the magnificent debuts of mystery fiction.,"Styles, the first Christie novel, introducing Hercule Poirot (and Captain Hastings and Inspector Japp), is one of the greatest debut novels of the mystery field. It heralded the start of the Golden Age of detective fiction. The book does not yet have the great, easy to read prose that would be a hallmark of the author in the years to come, but is near it. The very ingenious plot, the use of one of the great ploys of classical detective fiction, the various subplots, and the many sympathetic characters are all elements of Dame Agatha's later justly famous novels and are handled here very skilfully. It possibly deserves 4 stars for its ""standalone"" merits but the moment it arrived and its historical significance in the genre raise it to a 5. Not to be missed."
3,Good story but don't order this edition,"This is another enjoyable Poirot mystery, but I do not recommend this particular paperback edition. It is a text-only copy which means that there are at least 3 different images referred to in the story that do not appear in the book. It's very frustrating."
5,This is an great introduction to Agatha Christie,"Christie's first mystery and we are introduced to the Belgian detective extraordinaire- Hercule Poirot. I've never been able to decide which of her detectives I liked the best- the sweet old Miss Marple or the sometimes insufferable Mr Poirot. Several of her later works have made the transition from books to movies and stage plays one of which, The Mousetrap, has run on a London stage continuously since 1952, so her work definitely has staying power! It is worth your while to give her a try- or try several."
4,Will recommend,My sister in law loves Christie...so I thought I'd try one out. I very much enjoyed it though I was not able to figure out the killer til the end. I already told my mom she needed to read it as well.
3,Time warp,"Not that Agatha Christie was a great writer, but she was typically readable, and even if the plots weren't totally predictable, the shtik was. Styles suffers in particular because she doesn't really make us care about any of the people. Less than a week since I finished reading it, and I barely remember what it was about."
5,reading,I enjoy these type of mystery books. Holds your attention the whole way through. Unable to determine who the culprit is until the end of the book.
4,The Perfect Way to Start the Summer,"Agatha Christie's first Hercule Poirot mystery is the ever-delightful The Mysterious Affair at Styles. All of her trademarks are right here from the beginning in the character of Poirot and his brilliant gray matter and the delightful Hastings (before he become completely stuffy, as in the later books). There are red herrings aplenty and everyone seems to be up to something suspicious, much like one would want from an English country house. I have taken a summer vow to re-read all of the Poirot books that I read over the past four decades but this time to read them in the order they were written. The sole advantage of memory loss may be the ability to read these books again without a clue as to who did it. Maybe growing older will not be so bad. This book makes a perfect start to the series and to my summer. A bon-bon of Belgian chocolate."
2,missing important information,"due to ebook formatting issues, some pictures and passages are missing. specifically at the end of chapter 4, poirot finds a note that says ""I am possessed, he is possessed."" it's confusing not to have the information, but if you don't want to search online to find the missing pieces, you can infer most of what is happening by how the characters react"
1,Layout is hard to read!,"This version of the book is center-justified, making it very hard to see which lines of dialogue are spoken by which character. The good news is that it's free - but still, I am going to buy a different version."
2,Not her Best,"I hate to say anything disrespectful about the greatest mystery writer of all time, but to be quite honest, I found this book as somewhat of a let down. The first two I read, Murder on the Orient Express and And Then There Were None or Ten Little Indians, absolutely blew me a way. The mysterious affair at styles was nothing less than frustrating to read. All of the characters seem tainted and by the end of the novel, I didn't care who killed her as long as he/she suffered greatly. The plot was heavy and slow and the case was not only unsolvable from a reader's stand point, but a bit lagging and dull. I hate to be so cruel, but that's my honest opinion! I am glad that so many others have such nice things to say about the book!"
1,Don't buy! Illustrations are missing.,Important illustrations that are central to the plot is missing from this edition making it very frustrating to read :-(
1,No drawings,"I have not read this book. It contains drawings of floor plans, will fragments, etc that are relevant to the story. This version does NOT include these. So I'm sort of lost a few chapters into the book. You would be better off getting the paperback rather than the electronic version. I have asked for my money back or an exchange for a version that does have the drawings. I'm not optimistic about either happening. I really kind of surprised that Amazon would overlook this sort of thing. Very disappointed with my purchase at the moment."
3,"Good story, good Kindle Edition","The famous first Hercule Poirot novel is in good Kindle format,BUT there are substantial spaces (linrs) between paragraphs. No typos."
4,Still fresh on a re-read,"Good book - Poirot's first.Clues are all in the open for the reader to see, yet it is a difficult solution to crack. Perhaps due to two critical pieces of knowledge - one in chemistry and another in British law.Read it for the third or fourth time now. Still liked it very much, despite remembering the solution and most of the details."
3,Clues?,"Mysteries are not my favorites, but when I read one I like to have all the clues needed to solve it. Why spend all that time reading when some cards are missing from the deck?"
4,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,"I always enjoy a quick ""who-done-it"". Agatha Cristie introduces enough suspicious characters and intrigue to keep you guessing , but not so much as to confuse.Dectective Pierotis as usual very clever."
3,A good start for Christie,"This is Agatha Christie's first book and through the characters of Hercule Poirot and Hastings one can see how clever she is at weaving a story of suspense. I cannot give her more than three stars because I didn't think the other characters in this mystery were well developed. I would have liked more back story on the life and especially the love between the three main people. If you're looking for a light suspenseful story, Christie will fill that bill."
3,Complete set info,"A complete set of the Agatha Christie Mystery Collection is 88 books. However, 14 alternate titles to some of the books in the collection were also published, making a ""complete"" set 102 books. And some books were republished late in the series by other publishers. If you collected every single variation of the books, there are about 125 books in the set, although most people probably consider 88 or 102 to be a complete collection."
4,Addicting,I have read this book about three times and I never get bore. It is an exciting an intriguing mystery.
4,Myterious Affair at Style ebook,"Anyone with an ereader will appreciate the quick download of the Amazon ebooks. I plan to gather a few more books for my tablet's library before vacations and trips. Books will remain my mainstay for reading pleasure, but ebooks can't be beat for flexibility and ease of portability."
4,Still Reading,Haven't gone back to this but I do like it. Bought it for my daughter so we'll be getting back to this in January. Good classic book.
3,Classic mystery,"This was my first Agatha Christie novel. If you enjoy a classic mystery, similar to Clue, you will enjoy this book."
4,Lynn's feel for mysteries,It was good. I am not a big fan of mysteries but I needed an easy read and that was perfect!
4,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,You just can't go wrong with a mystery written by Agatha Christie. She was one of the truly great writers of her time.
2,Leaves much to be desired,"While I adore all things Poirot, this particular publication leaves much to be desired...mostly the essential images. Literally, images of clues (scribbles on paper, bits of burned documents, maps of the house) that should appear in the reading are absent. Some do not affect the storyline but others make it impossible to follow the conclusions of the characters because the reader is missing vital information. Aside from that, the pages look like simple bare internet printouts. If one cares little for aesthetics in his/her reading experience, this should not pose a problem. For others (myself included) it is a deterent to a truly enjoyable read. I suggest anyone seeking an inexpensive version of this book to choose the Barnes and Noble publication. Also inexpensive, but featuring all the bells and whistles of which Hercule Poirot himself would approve."
3,Solid Start,"Christie's first published novel is clunky and over-worked, but it has two things going for it: it introduces Poriot and it clearly demonstrates Christie's talent for creating a complex plot with an unexpected resolution. In the years to come, Christie will write a great many better novels than STYLES, but it is a solid start to a brilliant career. Christie fans will enjoy the book; others, however, may find it dated and wordy."
4,"Nice hat, but runs very small.","I just received my hat in Black, size L/XL, and it runs very small. Usually a size Large fit me OK, or a size 7 1/8 to 7 1/4 also fit me well. I was surprised, and disappointed that this hat ran so small...so deducted one star for fit."
5,Stunningly Beautiful,"This is beautiful music from off the beaten path, played skillfully and with feeling. As a bonus, included are Hough's typically terrific liner notes. And for once, Hyperion even managed to get the duration time posted on the back to actually match that of the cd. Well done!!!"
4,Who Said The English Can't Compose Music?,"I had occasion to get a recording of Kenneth Leighton's ""Six Studies (Study Variation) Op. 56. I had to purchase this CD as it contains the only available recording of the piece. I am very happy I did as it contains some fabulous music, which is beautifully played by Stephen Hough who contributes two short compositions of his own. The other composers, among them Alan Rawsthorne, Stephen Reynolds, Edward Elgar (how did he get in there), Stephen Reynolds, are easy to listen to. Hough has a lovely touch and the recording could not be better. The Leighton? It concludes the recording and will wake you up if you doze off while listening to the soothing, magical music, that precedes it."
4,Naughty boys need love too,"He may be an expatriate boy-bander, but Robbie Williams shares much more in common with pop vocalists like Elton John and George Michael than he does with, say, Justin Timberlake. For the most part, Robbie's music is well-crafted, tuneful and catchy, the songs made more for the long haul than they are eager to jump on every pop music trend. Robbie's persona is always cheeky and ironic, and yet if you pay close attention to the lyrics of most of his songs, they're full of yearnings for love, peace and self-acceptance. That's what makes Robbie Williams interesting and enigmatic: this combination of the rabble-rousing bad boy and the sensitive, poetic soul. Overall, this is a very worthwhile collection for any pop music fan."
3,"Not the greatest album, but not the worst either","I purchased this album on a whim and must say it's not the greatest album.I like a few songs and rest of the ablum seems rather scattered.Robbie Williams sounds the same on almost every track. The only songs I like are ""Angels"",""Millennium"",""NO Regrets"",and ""Eternity"" every other song sounds the same to me.Overall it can be a great album for some one who is either a big fan of his or likes his brand of singing/music."
1,dissatisfied customer,"Not received product due to my refusal to pay 12.50, ($18.77), customs charge. When purchased I expected that this would be sent to me from Amazon UK, (makes sense), not USA thus making the purchase price with all the extras unacceptable."
5,Why is this an import???,"Granted, he's not a household name in the US (maybe it's because some people feel he comes off too smug), but a lot of people know ""Angels"", ""Millenium"", ""Rock DJ"" and ""Feel"" at least, and his cover of ""We Are The Champions"" with Queen... Live 8 in the US didn't show his performance but the rebroadcast the following week showed an amazing set.Worth picking up as an import, but I've seen it in Canada and Mexico for more reasonable prices..."
4,A Great Starting Point,"This is a great starting point for music lovers in the U.S. who are unfamiliar with Robbie Williams. (I wasnt until the movie De-Lovely) Why he hasnt hit it big here, I dont understand, nor will you after listening to this Greatest Hits collection. Full of catchy, infectious pop tunes you'll want to listen to again and again. This wont be your last Robbie Williams CD, that I can assure you. Four and a half stars. Well worth your money."
2,robbie williams is too overrated,"out of the many male pop singers out there robbie williams is my least favourite. i never really understood the hype behind his music, maybe he is just way too overpromoted. alot of his music is boring(hardly any dance beats), heck i like ronan keating better and his music is slow but not boring like robbie's except for a few fun pop songs like ""rock dj"". if you want some listenable male talent i suggest you buy cd's by....george michael,ronan keating,peter andre,craig david,shaggy,usher and michael jackson."
3,career moves,"I have to admit, Robbie Williams has had a colourful career so far. I first started to enjoy his work when he played Mork in Mork and Mindy. As he slowly became a Hollywood name he gained respect with excellent performances in movies such as Good Will Hunting.It was his rather diverse shift into becoming the 'fat' element of Take That that threw me off course a little. All those pop tunes, Barry Manilow covers and stupid dance moves just didn't suit an aging actor. It wasnt until he released Angel that he started to win back the respect of grown up music lovers.I'd like to see him relive his role of Mork and burst from the egg one more time. Just think, he could probably spearhead the Official Movie Soundtrack. Then again, can you see Mork with tatoos? Maybe a bad idea."
4,Robbie Hits,"Britain's main man dismisses his first hit (a cover of the George Michael classic ""Freedom"") to start his collection with his own material. This anthology, from ""the fat one from Take That,"" lines up great hits like ""Rock DJ,"" Millennium"" and ""She's The One."" Also, there are lesser-known gems like ""Lazy Days,"" the robust ""Let Me Entertain You"" and the delightfully sorrowful ""The Road to Mandalay."" Another hit that faded into oblivion is not included on this collection - the chilled ""South of the Border."" Overall, Williams showcases his impressive career on this CD with two new songs."
1,A song is missing!,"The only reason I ordered this CD is for the song ""She's the One"". When I received it, that song was not listed at all. It includes a spanish version of Angels and Better Man, but no ""She's the One"". I am returning this item!"
2,stereotypes throughout,"I know that sexual fantasies can and are full of stereotypes and one or two in a novel or a short story can be great. But this novel, which was a best seller in Europe when it came out in German in 1987, has almost nothing but stereotypes. There's the boss controlled by the female underling who really seems incapable of true affection. They both seem to have a mental illness or at least emotional problems. She's cold and wears lots of leather and boots; so are all her female friends, even the lesbians who are still attracted to the main male character. And finally, and most disappointing, there's the death or faked death of one of the characters. I'm so tired of books claiming to be BDSM and yet fulfiliing all the negative stereotypes."
3,Confusing array of people and circumstances but a lovely love story,"Don't get me wrong I love Virginia Henley's stories but this one had so many clans and circumstances to keep track of. I got the feeling she did a lot of research on the happenings and clans of Scottland, but then haphazardly placed them into her love story between Ram and Tina. For me this one lacked the tingle of many of her other stories and towards the end I wanted to just hurry and finish it, maybe thats how she felt when she was writing it."
4,Captivating,"This book was a total surprise and far more interesting than your standard romance novel. On the positive side, it is well written, with interesting characters and history, so much so I found I couldn't put the book down. On the downside, there is a crudeness to their bed sport that gets old, but that said, it was a really good read and made me a fan."
2,Language too vulgar,"This is the first and last book I will read from this author. I didn't like the crude language used. F--k instead of make love.. c---k instead of... anything else to describe a man's privates. Also, Valentina was so nasty to Ram and her desire for revenge. I also don't like ghosts that talk and card readers that tell one's fortune. Too much supernatural for me. This is one book that will not remain in my collection."
4,Great liner!!,"I've been using this for about a year now and LOVE it! I'm very picky about what goes on my face too. No irritation at all, goes on very smooth and stays on. I highly recommend!!!"
4,New generation of tangueros,"If you study music, love Argentine tango and specially the ""orquestas tipicas"". This is a masterpiece.A new generation of musicians formed a school of tango music just to play like in the old times.This is the result of the documentary ""Si sos brujo"".The only thing you may not like about this CD is that there are some commentaries from musicians in Spanish between the songs."
2,Great sound !!!!,Sound is great !!!!!Operating manual information is very limited but it's easy to use just playing with Decoder some time. Sound will depend of speakers quality attached to it.
2,some blades not balanced,I am a framing contractor and use a saw all day long. Some of these blades have made my circular saw wobble . I tried the blades in two different saws and they did the same thing. I would spend a little more and buy a better quality blade(I like the freud).
2,Not tearless,"After reading the good reviews for this product I decided to order it for my children. Last night when I first used it, both of them screamed when it got to their eyes!! It is not tearless at all! Also, the scent is not good, smells of ""old lady"" soap. I hope at least it doesn't dry up my little ones' sensitive skin."
4,Lovin' Li'l Goat's Milk,"We've been using this product for about a month now, and are happy with the way it's making our son's skin feel. It lathers nicely, and his skin is so soft after a bath. And, when he wakes up he smells so fresh and clean! He has sensitive skin, and so far he has no dry patches with this new soap."
3,A Christmas Without Snow,I have read a lot of the reviews here and I wonder if they watched the same movie I just did. Granted it was made in 1980. The picture quality is not as good as new ones made today. This movie is packed with a lot of very good actors. John Houseman is wonderful in this. This movie covers a lot of every day trials that average people go through. A Black boy is wrongly accused of vandelism. The preachers son is the guilty party. A Mother leaves her home after a divorce to go to another city to try and make a new life for herself and her son. A Womans husband has cancer and the treatment did not work and he dies and she asked the minister why God would take a young men like that. People working together to repair the pipe organ that the preachers son almost distroyed.The choir working very hard to sound like their new choir director wants them to sound. I thought it was a very moving and interesting movie.I am glad I bought it and I will watch it again and again.
3,"Enjoyed the story very much, quality of DVD lacking","I saw this movie years ago on TV and really liked it, so I purchased it here. Like other reviewers, I agree that the DVD seems inferior. The picture is grainy and at one point the picture wobbled for a moment. This is no fault of the seller, I knew what I was getting into. My advice is if you like the Messiah and are a fan of Michael Learned and/or John Houseman you'll like the movie. If you want a DVD that is more professionally made with a crisp clear picture, this probably isn't for you."
2,Ho Hum Yawn,"DVD box says a divorced woman has a clash with the choirmaster; never happened.Very little energy expended by the cast, with the except of one verbal outburst (poorly played) by a female musical snob who left the choir.Nice little movie if you need something to put you gently to sleep."
1,A Christmas without Snow (ASIN: B000E1P27Q),"Christmas Without Snow, AThis DVD has very very poor video quality and the audio is like from a 1935 Victrola. Save your money and don't purchase this DVD. There has got to be a betterDVD someplace."
2,A Christmas Without Snow,"The quality of this film is just awful. It was grainy and hard on the eyes. Also the sound was very poor. I almost wanted to stop watching, due to the poor quality of the DVD. I might have enjoyed this movie if the picture had been clearer."
2,mis-titled,"the quality of the acting was good, but the title did not fit with the content of the movie - misleading........"
5,ALWAYS A TREAT,It's always a treat to see Michael Learned who gave us so many enjoyable hours on Walton's Mountain.Once again she gives an outstanding performance!
2,"Not a Classic, Not total trash.","I got this movie in one of those DVD mulitpacks,I had never heard of it before. The only huge thing I really had a problem with was the VERY BAD SOUND AND VIDEO. One of the main problems I had with this film is that about half of the characters are really annoying such as : Murial Moore she has the most annoying laugh. (Off the subject) am I the only one who thinks that Murial(I have no idea how to spell her name) cannot read.?Another gem of a character is the Dane guy who tries to force himself on the main character Zoe I think her name is? This movie should of been called ""A Christmas with people who remind you of your annoying relatives."""
2,DVD quality not great,"I would love to see a decent copy of this movie. The Westlake Entertainment DVD has poor color (lots of greens), and this version by Synergy Entertainment is not much better. There are also some glitches from the mastering process. As a movie, it shows some truth about churches and church choirs. Selections from Handel's Messiah are linked to underscore plot lines in the story. A nice little TV movie--too bad there's not a better DVD of it."
3,"Charming, feel good movie","Someone loaned me a VHS tape of this flick and I enjoyed it enormously; however, the quality was poor. Bought the DVD hoping it would be of better quality visually and, more importantly, have better audio quality. I was disappointed. The CD I bought is a bit better than the VHS tape, but not much. It's still an enjoyable film, especially for those of us who enjoy singing in choirs!"
4,Download this movie for free legally,This is descent low-budget Christmas movie. What I would like to tell you about is that you can download load this movie for free because it is in the public domain. Just go to this site for the torrent link [...........]
3,Okay Drama Badly copied on DVD,"Sitting through ""A Christmas Without Snow"" can be an enjoyable afternoon especially watching Michael Learned (Mama Walton) and John Houseman (Professor Kingfield) give their stock performances. The main plot line is okay, except that there are far too many subplots, many of which are totally forgotten by the end. There are also logistical problems in the story (Her son sends her Kindergarten level paintings, when he is a smart 10-year old.)However, the portrayal of the amateur choir, especially the technicalities of singing are well done.My biggest problem is the quality of the DVD - it is obviously just a cheap copy of the tape."
1,depressing movie,"I got the impression that someone who hates Christmas wrote this movie. It has none of the qualities that make a good Christmas movie. love, 'feel-good'emotion, snow, a loveable character, and so on. Rude church choir director kicking people out how sing less than perfect, unsucessful mom who cant support her son, drug using pastor son no happy ending, and hot weather!The stars did a good job for the script they had to work with, and the music, (The Messiah) was nice at the end.If you want to watch John Houseman, buy it, but if you want a good Christmas movie you should skip it. Worst I have seen."
1,Not a Merry Christmas Movie,"IN SHORT, THIS MOVIE ABSOLUTELY STUNK. WASTE OF TALENT OF MICHAEL LEARNED AND JOHN HOUSMAN WAS COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS IN THIS STUPID ROLE. THE QUALITY OF THE DVD WAS ALSO PATHETIC IN SOUND AND A SKIPPING FLIPPING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOVIE. OVERALL BAD MOVIE AND BAD TECHNICAL QUALITY. HERE IS A DVD FOR THE YARD SALE"
2,Not a Keeper,"As several have already commented, the print quality leaves much to be desired. That aside, this is not a ""warm fuzzy"" type of Christmas movie. It is a rather bleak look at the holiday, though it may be interesting to you if you have ever sung in an amatuer choir. In spite of the valiant efforts of the big name actors, this left me feeling rather empty and that is not how I like to spend my holiday."
4,Welcome Recognition of a World Historical Figure,"Ms. Formicola's book is worth reading because it documents the world historical impact of John Paul II in the downfall of the Soviet bloc and in numerous other regions of the world. There are some editing and minor factual problems, but, overall, the book will provide the reader with an appreciation of the papacy of John Paul II as a great positive force in world history. She has performed a needed task that will hopefully be followed by a revised and updated version in the near future."
5,Verdammt... I love it!,"This cd has an upbeat rhythm that will keep you smiling! Unfortunately, my dog played frisbee with it, so now I'm getting another one! It's worth it!"
3,A little disappointed,I was a little disappointed with the quality of the carvings shown in the book. So I'd rate it average.
4,Worth reading,"I just passed this exam and I can say that this book gives you enough info to pass. It does put accents differently then the test, and some of the questions were not covered in this book, but overall you should be able to make it."
5,Our Teaching Professors Made us Read the Book,"I'm a teaching student, and our professor read this book, and assigned it to us as a textbook for our Internet and Education class. It was so easy to read, we almost forgot we were in class. When I begin teaching in two years, I'll make sure that I follow her safety tips for the classroom. I gave it to my mom to read to keep my little sister safe on the Internet. She liked it too."
1,Internet Safety Whale,"If you're serious about protecting your children, I would not recommend buying this book. I saw Ms. Ahab on the Today Show recently and she made a number of gross misstatements about the penalties for trolling applicable under the 2008 federal Ombibus Interwebs Anti-Stalking and Trolling Act. Ms. Ahab is obviously more concerned with getting on TV so she can sell books than she is learning the law in which she's supposedly some kind of expert. If you want to protect your kids, I suggest consult one of the books written by Chip Hansen."
5,Awesome soap,"From the second I started using this soap, it is the only one I use. I love the smell and it makes me feel fresh and clean. It has this really cool refreshing smell to it."
2,"Great price, wish it worked!","Try something else unless you have children to wash with this soap. This stuff just really doesn't get you clean. Period. My husband smells just as bad as he did before he got into the shower after using this stuff and has to do it all over again. If you have kids in sports, try Old Spice or Safeguard. This stuff just won't do the job."
4,like it!,"Hard to put on, but I like it. It still has some bubbles in places. They should have gave you 2 of them."
2,Could not smooth it out.,"BoxWave Amazon Kindle Paperwhite ClearTouch Anti-Glare Screen Protector (Single Pack with Cleaning Cloth and Applicator Card) - Matte Anti-Fingerprint Screen Guard Cover for the Kindle PaperwhiteI was told I needed it to maintain my screen so I purchased it. I was also told that it would be difficult to put on; however, I found it impossible to put on and at the same time remove all the air bubbles that popped up. I removed it several times but to no avail. I am very disappointed in this product. I only hope that it does protect my Kindle screen."
4,"overall, satisfied","The package include clear instructions, a piece of cloth, and a helpful card-everthing you need to apply the cover. It's so considerate!the only thing I struggle about is to take certain time to move away the bubbles~"
2,Kindle Paperwhite,"Having lost my original Kindle that was no longer available, I chose the Paperwhite. While it has a few good features it doesn't compare to the original. I thought maybe I just had to get used to it but I've had it for a while now and really miss my old Kindle. The new one has nothing to hold on to. The frame is way too small so I am constantly touching the screen unintentionally. I really miss the keyboard. I used it a lot to recall formerly introduced characters or situations. Now when I use that drop-down touch function I lose my place in the book. So now I have to make a point of the location so I can go back there manually. I really like the lighted screen. But I would go back to the original in a heartbeat."
1,Amateurish at best.,This would warrant zero stars if it were not for the Karloff interview and it was a non profit production.Half the DVD is on how the DVD was made!
3,Too thick.,"The fleece is very thick. Also, it unzips from the top. I prefer the Halo Sleepsack which unzips from the bottom for easier diaper changes."
3,helpful for those who have guitar expireince,this book is a bit advanced for me as I am just begining to learn guitar!
2,Not For Dummies,"I picked this up when I first started out with guitar, and that was a big mistake. This book is nothing more than a reference, and it doesn't do that very well."
2,Not for beginners,"I am 13 but I thought I could still handle this book, considering I have beed playing for half a year now, but this book is very bad. All the info is piled together, rushed and confusing. I though for dummies meant for dummies. Do not buy this book. WASTE."
3,Not for the absolute beginner,"I would have gave it more stars but this book is great if you already have a good grasp on guitar basics, but if you are a newbie like me it may be a little hard to pick up. Great book I am sure to look at it again once I get a better feel for the guitar, has a lot of good techniques in it."
2,I usually liked learning guitar....,"Almost every other lesson or book for learning guitar I have liked. I played for almost a year before touching this book, then I was dumb and bought it online. Honestly, a waste of money. There are many better guitar books that you can get out there or even I have gotten better free lessons online than in this. The author made the lessons to complex to truly understand everything the way that you should. I would recommend this book only to true intermediate to advanced level guitar players."
1,Technical issues make it unusable,I'm writing about a problem specifically with the Kindle edition:The figures are cropped off along the right edge. This is a pretty big deal because the figures are of musical notation and you can't see any notes that are along that edge.I'm using Kindle in a PC and on an iPhone.
5,Inspiring!,"I've read and reread this book and it's sequel for the last thirty years. I feel like I'm part of their family. I think Marie's books about Karen have had that effect on everyone that has read them. I have also wondered all these years what has become of the family. As I began ""Karen"" yet again over my cereal this morning, I thought ""she's 59 years old now."" How I would love to know more about her and her family. I'll add my name to the list: if anyone knows anything about the Killilea family, please let me know."
4,More info about the Killileas,"I loved the Karen books as child; Karen was my favorite real-life heroine, next to Anne Frank. Now I am the mother of a disabled daughter and I haven't thought of Karen and her family for years. She was mentioned in conjunction with a group home and this brought back memories so I did a search on Karen, Well, the Cerebral Palsy Society has a news story on its website covered the news up-to-date of the Killilea family. Some are gone now but the news of the very nice and inspiring family is good to know. So search and ye will find."
5,UPDATE - The Killilea Family,"On Oct. 25, 1999, I wrote a review of the wonderful book,""Karen."" I shared that I had met the actor Pat O'Brien (Uncle Pat to the Killilea kids) and had been told that Jimmy and Marie were divorced. I now know that he was referring to young Marie, but only found out for sure within this past month. Because of these online reviews and the fact that some had left their e-mail addresses for contact, a group of us formed a bit of a ""fan club,"" have been together on a Yahoo site since Oct. 29, 1999, and now have a membership of over 600! It is there that we have discovered a variety of information and have become friends as well. As always, the fact remains that Marie's are among the most well written, entertaining, and inspiring books of all time. If you're interested in more information, you might check out the site at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Killilea_Fans/"
5,One of the best books I have ever read!,"25 years after reading it, this is still one of my favoritebooks ever and I am trying to find a copy of it and the sequels togive to my daughter! This book had such an effect on me that whole phrases and lines of it are still contained in my memory! Please someone e-mail me if you know what happened to Karen and her family! This should be a People Magazine follow-up story, they write about everyone else! Oh Karen, where are you?"
5,A wonderful family to spend time with,"My camp counselor read this book aloud to our cabin in the 1960's, and we were riveted to every word. Later, I read it over again many times. It is a wonderful story of struggle and triumph, but most important it is a wonderful story of a loving family. My favorite parts of the book are the way the family ""adopts"" just about everyone who is lucky enough to cross their path, and the way that of all Karen's achievements, the ones they are proudest of are her sense of humor and her loving heart. I also love the way that the sequel shows that they are committed to what is best for Karen, rather than traditional concepts of ""normality"" or even previous goals like walking."
5,Excellent book to read!,"When I first read this book, I was just starting my freshman year in high school. Although ""KAREN"" I read then was a graded reader for Japanese high school students, it was an impressive book (very difficult, though) and most of all the students in the class cried when Karen said ""I CAN WALK, I CAN TALK. I CAN READ. I CAN WRITE. I CAN DO ANYTHING.""Several years later, I found ""KAREN"" and its sequel here and read whole story. The story still gave me strong impression and gave me a chance to think ""if I had been like Karen, what I would do?"" I just keep my friends who can read English) to read both the books (unfortunately, most of my friends cannot read English)."
5,NOTE THIS CASE HAS A CLIP!,"This is hands down the best case for a Treo 700p/w. IT's very well made and provides the easiet access to all the features. HOWEVER -- The case described here is the one with the belt clip. I hate belt clips. But if that's your thing, this is a great case.I have to send it back for the one without the clip. If it's anything but a smooth process, I will post more here.peet"
4,Our Guide Douglas,"From the very first sound of tablas and electronic effects ""Freak In"" might not seem like a jazz album, but with Douglas, who has recorded everything from Klezmer to straight-ahead to covers of Rufus Wainwright, this hardly matters. Douglas' pristine trumpet and Marc Ribot's eclectic guitar rise above the mix of loops and effects and convince the listener that there is someone in control on this amazing ride through Douglas' combination of 70's Miles Davis, drum and bass, blues, post-bop and electronica."
5,Great,"This was well worth the money. As any documentary there are spots that have you scratching your head and yawning. I made it through it in about 2 weeks. I will watch again. If you like WWII you will like this, it really shows how ""stupid"" these ""leaders"" were. Hitler and Stalin both. they lead through fear and brutality, just like others we have seen (Amin,Saddam etc.) We well see these type of leaders again. I just hope not here in the US once our soveninty has all but been given away by our politicians. Our freedom of speech is erroding at an alarming rate along with our right to assemble. Will our guns be next? That is our last stand againt the likes of these power hungry blood thirty tyrants. Learn from our history."
2,"Captivating Images, Simplistic History","My mind and imagination were captivated by the film footage. That alone makes the documentary worth viewing.There are several inaccuracies of fact, ones that should have been easy to capture as they require no specialist knowledge.The main problem I have with the film is the inordinate amount of time spent on various crimes & ills of Stalin.Not that this information about Josef Stalin isn't interesting, a-lot of it doesn't seem very relevant.And the film sheds no light on Stalin or his crimes. According to the narrative tens of millions were murdered by Stalin because he was paranoid, megalomaniac, addicted to power, etc. No time is spent at all on Stalin's ideology. It would sound pretty ridiculous if someone argued that ""Hitler"" killed so many Jews because he had a thirst for power or he liked violence.Lots of problems with the narrative, but the series can't help but to make emotional impact."
5,Outstanding,"This was one of the most eye-opening documentaries I've seen. I knew little about the Eastern front as a high school student. It wasn't apologetic towards Stalin or the USSR, but does note the Soviet contribution to the defeat over Nazi Germany. Recommended for students of history."
5,Russia's War. Blood Upon the snow. DVD.,"It's a very good documentary.In fact, I think of it's the better work about Russia's War.Sincerelly,R.NOTE 1: The best Ally of Stalin during the war was Adolf Hitler. Without the racial hatred, USSR had fallen not in 1991 but in 1941.NOTE 2: In memoriam of white Russian heroes who fought with Franco against communism in Spain: [...]"
4,russia's war,My co worker is abig fan of this era and reads everything about it. I bought this as a gift and he was very pleased. He gave the narrative highest praise. I may go watch it with him some time but he moved across town and we lost track of each other also he drinks too much vodka.
4,Thorough,"Good overview. Viewing can be ponderous, but for those interested in this period of Russian history, you will not be disappointed."
5,A favorite addition to any kitchen cookbook collection,"Showcasing more than 175 Southern and Southwestern dishes from a culinary era well before the coming dominance of ""fat-free"" manias with respect to fine dining, L.B. Cobb's Old-Fashioned Recipes For Modern Cooks: Foods With All The Flavor You Remember In Grandmother's Cooking is as much fun and nostalgia to browse through as it is fun and fulfilling to cook from. Whether for special occasion celebrations or daily family dining, here are recipes to please any palate and satisfy any appetite. From Chicken Baked in Wine; Sweet and Sour Pork Chops; and Quick Spiced Peaches; to Biscuit Gravy, Asparagus Soup; and Buttermilk Pie, Old-Fashioned Recipes For Modern Cooks will quickly prove to be a favorite addition to any kitchen cookbook collection!"
2,It's definitely a sequel,"I love Shanghai Noon. So when I saw Shanghai Knights on DVD I just had to buy it. I should have rented.Sure there are creative fight scenes and Owen delivers some great lines, but the whole story feels forced and comedic timing feels rushed. The previews look like a comic masterpiece, critics praise it, but my family all voted thumbs down.Shanghai Knights now collects dust on our DVD shelf while Shanghai Noon garners the screen time. When it comes to the Shanghai series, be a cowboy, not a knight."
3,A step down but still a worthy sequel.,"Don't pay attention to the lack of continuity of SK with Shanghai Noon SN. The guts of this movie is the continuing relationship between the laconic Chong Wang, played by jackie Chan (no longer a NEW mega star, but an authentic one) and Wyatt Earp, who goes by the name of Roy OBannon, played by the new mega star Owen Wilson.The stunt work is not 5 star, but it is still good enough to entertain. This is safe for the family.The bad guy in this one is even better than the three bad guys in SN, maybe because the writers could pile all the badness onto one really great bad guy. This is 3 stars - GOOD. Most people who like Chan and Wilson will enjoy this fun romp."
4,"""Shanghai Noon 2""","Wowzer! My family laughed so hard after they saw this movie. It is splendid fun for everybody and their pets! Yes! Chon Wang (Jackie Chan) and Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson) are back! They have reunited and have traveled to London to find the Imperial Seal of China stolen by a bad, nasty man (some English dude). ""Shanghai Knights"" is a good sequel, but it doesn't have Lucy Liu... I was heartbroken. I went on a fast food eating spree because I was so distraught! Anguish! Oh well, good movie otherwise."
2,Very Disappointing,"I left the theater so underwhelmed and disappointed, having been a fan of Jackie Chan's and Owen Wilson's first movie together. What a contrast of good and bad. The acting was less than convincing (totally unnatural) and made the film look like a ""pot luck"" failure. Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson, who normally play off each other quite well, acted as though they read their lines for the first time before each scene was shot, and relied on their ""talent"" (which was none in this movie) to carry them through. This leads one to ponder: What happened to the director; was he asleep at the switch?"
2,It's not as funny as Shanghai Noon,It's not as funny as Shanghai Noon. You can see it's obviously a spin-off of Shanghai Noon. That effort fails completely.If you like Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson you still want to watch this.
2,Another uninspired sequel,"Chon Wang (Jackie Chan) and Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson) reunite to recover the Imperial Seal of China and avenge the death of Chon's father, the Keeper of the Seal. They are joined by Chon's sister, the beautiful and equally dangerous Lin (Fann Wong). The chemistry of Wilson and Chan is as delightful as ever, but that (and the beautiful and talented Wong) is about the only reason to watch this tired comedy. Even the action scenes are uninspired. A disappointment."
1,You Have To Be A Fan,"I tried to give these two a second chance, but they flunked. You must be dedicated fans in order to enjoy this movie. I let the ""two thumbs up"" trick me into watching this movie. This only proves that critics are jokes. Jackie Chan can keep his wanna be Bruce Lee movies. The good movies with Owen Wilson are the good movies without Owen Wilson as the main character.Young Ones Remember: Critic with thumb up has two glass eyes.Me No Grasshopper"
3,Deja vu?,I thought this was cute and Owen Wilson was a comedic treat but why did it have the same feeling that Shanghai Noon had? I mean the main villain died in the same way and there was little things that was lifted straight from the first script. I also have to admit that Fann Wong was a nice addition to the cast and I enjoyed it over all but the only reason why it got three stars in my books was because of the fact that it felt like a sequal for sequal's sake.
3,Good but not great,"As the once great simon cowell would say, Ok, it was good, i'm not jumping out of my chair, but it was ok."
2,"""Shanghai Knights"" not to good",... I love Jackie Chan! But he was not apealing in this movie. The action was dull and the humor was sour. This movie was dry and I dont really recomnd it. Unless your board and have nothing else to do.
4,Shanghai Knights,"IntroductionThe movie""Shanghai Knights"",directed by David Dobkin,is a funny and adventurous movie which you can watch if you had nothing to do.The PlotA chinese reble murdered John's(Jackie Chan)father and escapes to England.Now john and his friend,Roy(Owen Wilson),are going to London to get revenge for killing John's father.John and Roy met John's sister,Lin,while on the way and the three of them were going to get revenge together.Lin uncovered a worldwide conspiracy to murder the royal family but no one believe her.My OpinionThe movie is very funny when John use an umbrella to hit his enemies and uses a lemon and spueezes the juices at one of his enemies eyes.The Final CommentsI will give 4 out of 5 becaues it is very funny and I can assure you that you won't reget watching it.The lenght of the movie is about 1hour45minute.Rating CategoryPG"
3,KNIGHTS IN A DAZE,"The chemistry between Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson plus the stupendous battle scenes, culminating in a whopper on Big Ben, help elevate SHANGHAI KNIGHTS to an enjoyable film. Not quite as out and out hilarious as its prequel, KNIGHTS nevertheless uses its comic touches to advantage. We get Sir Arthur Conan Doyle; Charlie Chaplin; even Jack the Ripper in this anacrhonistic hodgepodge of lunacy. QUEER AS FOLKS' Aidan Gillen is a dashing and vile nemesis for our heroes, and demure and lovely Fann Wong lights up the screen with her combination of ferocity and naivete. The out of time soundtrack including WINCHESTER CATHEDRAL and ENGLAND SWINGS reinforces this movie's breezy tribute to modern times as well. There's also an innovative tip of the hat to Gene Kelly and SINGIN IN THE RAIN. SHANGHAI KNIGHTS is definitely not classic material, but it's an entertaining ninety minutes of foolishness."
3,So-so movie,It was ok...not NEAR as funny as the first movie.....Shanghai Noon. That's all I have to say!
4,Great as expected,"I don't need to give a play by play (it's all already been said). This movie is worth seeing, especially if you have an old student ID laying around to get a discount...By the way, Chris Rock was NOT in the Rush Hour movies. That was Chris Tucker... (sure that's what you meant *wink*)"
3,Doesn't live up to its prequel,"My wife and I are great fans of Jackie Chan and we both liked Shanghai Noon. That's why we rented Shanghai Knights. But this sequel was, frankly, very boring. Jackie has some nice fight sequences as usual. But the story was very weak (even for a martial arts movie!). It was also slow moving at parts, so much so that we were tempted to stop watching. And this is the first movie I've seen made by Jackie Chan where there's actually an adult scene not appropriate for kids (involves some yucky tongue-licking). It's a short scene, but still - I wonder if Jackie is trying to get away from the 'good and clean' image. Even without that scene, this movie is definitely not entertaining enough. I certainly wouldn't recommend buying it (rental maybe)."
1,2 hours of my life...Gone.,"""Shanghai Knights"" is one of the most derivative and clichéd movies I have had the misfortune of seeing in a very long time. With a thin plot, awful dialog, lifeless attempts at comedy, and typical ""buddy movie"" hijinks, this movie has terrible written all over it. Oh, and Jackie Chan fights with a ladder...again. If you value your money or your time at all, do not rent or buy this movie."
4,"Chon Wang, movie star...","This is a great sequel to a great movie. Owen Wilson and Jackie Chan are back as Roy O' Bannon and Chon Wang, and this time they have to go to London and retrieve the Chinese Imperial Seal. The plot, however, is not all that important, as the main entertainment comes from Chan's great stunts (yes, they are fewer and less dangerous than they used to be), Wilson's goofy humor, and comic guest appearances by famous people (my favorite being when Jack the Ripper gets kicked into the river).If you enjoy this kind of goofy buddy-type action movie, you'll love Shanghai Knights. If you want a plot...well, there's a little lacking here. The movie is very funny, and that's really all it needs to be to succeed."
4,perfect in its own little nifty way,"Shanghai Knights is an interesting movie. Of course it could have been better....but come on, it could have been worse. I personally thought it was a great movie! It had humor, sword fights, fist fights, and great actors. Now, this movie made me a HUGE fan of Aidan Gillen-he's great as Lord Rathbone. Of course Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson are spectacular too- as are the secondary characters. See this movie. It's a great movie!!(((the DVD extras are amazing: deleted scenes, audio commentary from the director and screen writers, a music video entitled ""action overload"" featuring all the fight scenes, and a ""fight manual"" with Jackie Chan and the director(David Dobkin)...all in all...the DVD is a great buy)))"
5,Excellent couldn't have been cooler,"litterally to me, this movie was incredible. The action, the settings and the jokes couln't have been better. You pair the two cowboys from Shangai Noon and make a better sequel that has better everything from the first. It starts with Jackie Chan's extremely hot sister who was hot and the father dude, never seen in first film, and father dude dies, in which Jackie Chan is left off at Carson City in 1887, 6 years after the first film, 1881, and Jackie must go to New York to find who else, Owen Wilson or Roy O Bannon. Whatever. But then Wilson is being I think considered a theif and the cops are looking for him and Chan does awesome stunts that to me seem impossible. Then the two buddies or seem to be buddies go to London, England and find Chan's awesome looking sister and the bad guy dude that killed Chan's father. Anyways it is a good movie. I really liked it.BYE YALL: PEACE OUT DVD STYLE"
2,Jackie can do better,"2 stars is generous, but I have a place in my heart for Jackie Chan. We rented this recently, and it left us all cold. The only redeeming qualities to me were Jackie Chan (because I'm usually a fan) and his stunts. We only laughed a couple of times throughout the entire movie, and it was supposed to be a comedy. To me it wasn't even funny accidentally. It had a very predictable but not believeable plot. It had quite a bit more offensive language and innuendos than the first movie, Shanghai Noon, so I wouldn't consider it a family movie. There was absolutely nothing likeable or redeeming about Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson) in this sequel -- he was just irritating. We rented it because the first movie was so funny and fun, but my family hardly laughed at all at this one. I'm just so glad we didn't actually pay to all go see at the theater."
2,Boring,"This sequel to Shanghai Noon is perhaps one of Jackie Chan's worst movies. The story is a cliche--Jackie has to rescue his sister and avenge his father's death. The twist in this story is that he has to go to England to find the killer. Of couse we have to put up with a lot of bad jokes about English food and stereotypical English gentlemen. I particularly hated the performance of Owen Wilson. I simply can't understand why he keeps getting cast as a comedian. He's definitely not funny at all. To make it worse, the character he plays has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Even Jackie Can is not at his best in this one. The fight scenes aren't as fluid as some of his other recent performances. His age really shows in his fight scenes. If you're craving a recent Jackie Chan film, you should stick with the Rush Hour series. I give this two stars instead of one out of goodwill for Jackie Chan."
3,Chan and Yen teamup... sort of,"I wasn't too impressed with this film, but it was entertaining. The action moves a bit away from Chan's recent American releases, but I think it's quite refreshing. It mixes a lot more combat with Jackie's natural acrobatic skills. Oh... and Donnie Yen is in it! He has one action scene, but seeing him fight is always amazing. There's a big difference in styles between Jackie's Opera Kung Fu and Yen's traditional, hard hitting power."
4,Suffers from poor editing,"Shanghai Knights had the potential to be as good or better than Shanghai Noon. Unfortunately, editing cut the heart out of the character development and the lyricism from the fight sequences.By choosing bathroom humor sequences over story, editing makes O'Bannon come across as the quintessential Ugly American. By cutting story-developing break-aways during the fight sequences, the very rhythms Chan is famous for in his choreography are undermined and the sequences become slow and seemingly overlong.As cut, I'd give the movie two stars at best. I gave the *DVD* four stars because thanks to the DVD the movie Shanghai Knights should have been is available to us.Get the DVD, watch the deleted scenes and reedit in your head. It's worth the effort. The end result has all the charm of a better than average ""buddie-movie"" and all the great action of Jackie Chan at his best."
4,Actually Pretty Good!,"I was pleasantly surprised by ""Shanghai Knights""! At first I thought it would be another hum-drum comedy about a two guys and their quest for adventure. However, I was actually left laughing throughout much of it.The story centers around our two heroes, Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson, who have come together again in order to find the murderer of John Wayne's (Chan) father. We follow the guys to England where they begin to track down the killer. Along the way, they meet up with John's sister, who is also out to avenge her father's death. Wilson's character is instantly smitten with her.I would recommend this film to people are in the mood to watch a really funny movie that will catapult you out of reality and into this surreal, and highly funny, world!"
3,"Good, But Stick To the First One","Shanghai Knights was a pretty decent movie, but I really enjoyed Shanghai Noon much better. In this movie, there was still a lot of action fight scenes, but it just wasn't as funny. The funniest part of this movie were the bluppers at the end of the movie. I say stick to the Shanghai Noon."
3,Could've been better,"I'm a BIG fan of Jackie's films, when the movie came out I went to see it the first day, but I must say I was a little dissapointed when I saw the fight between Jackie and Donnie Yen. In my opinion the fight was too short, and they made Donnie looked better thank Jackie. Jackie got his butt kicked. Also the final fight at the clock tower with the swords...Again, Jackie was not that good either. But overall it's a fun film. I hope there are longer and better fights in the future Jackie's films. Can't wait for ""The Medallion"" which comes out Aug 22, 2003."
5,A necessity for an interesting and appropriate vocabulary,"I have used Doubleday Roget's Thesaurus in Dictionary Form for 30 plus years. I started using it in college because it was easy to look up words in the dictionary format. I continued using it in my career as a writer. I cannot imagine writing letters, speeches, etc. without it. Now that I have retired, my wife uses my old Roget's Thesaurus for her crossword puzzles and loves it. Between the two of us, we wore it out. This new edition is as good as the previous one. If you think you will write something, I highly recommend it. If you think you will use it a lot (as I did), you might want to get the hardcover version. As I mentioned, my old hardcover Thesaurus lasted over 30 years."
1,Hard to use on Kindle,"It is a good thesaurus if this was in print form. However, there are no navigations like the built in dictionary in Kindle. I've tried to search for a word by typing it, but there is no search bar to type for your exact word. I also tried the ""Go to..."" function if there is at least a Table of Contents that split up each alphabet, but none like that. The closest thing for a word search would be the ""Search This Book"" option, but that will have multiple location results because the word ""discover"" is in Location 122, 567, 890, 2546, 7890, and does not locate the exact word.Is there a Thesaurus that is built like the one we have for Kindle where there is a word search bar?"
2,Great until the Battery Dies...,"Battery is sealed inside. Once it dies, no way to replace unless you want to start undoing stitches."
4,great find,"Great to have found reasonably priced vegan cosmetics! =)I was afraid this shade would be some scary 80s or frosted color, but it turns out to be perfect. Stays on long too."
5,Wonderful,"I got my first copy of this book along with my first microscope when I was in elementary school. It started me off a lifelong pursuit of science, both professionally and as an amateur. This is a fantastic book for both the young person interested in biology and the adult with an interest in the natural micro-world."
1,DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT,I wish I had read these reviews before I purchased a five user license! I am a very experienced PC user who supports a number of PCs and has been active in the software industry for more than 25 years.My PC is running Windows XP Pro and Outlook 2002.After installing Norton Antispam the boot time for my PC went from 55 seconds to 4 minutes and 35 seconds!Furthermore I could not import my address book as Norton Antispam could not recognise the Outlook 2002 address book. (By the way it is not corrupted as the Symantec website implies.)I was also amazed that it made no attempt to learn from the rules I had already built into Outlook for filtering spam.Fortunately I had made a System Restore Point before installing it so that I could uninstall it and go back to where I started.I wonder whether Symantec will refund my five user license?In summary DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!
1,Installation nightmare,"I installed NAS with windows XP and it would not work.After several e-mails and phone calls to their support desk in India they had me delete all my Norton programs (pc anywhere and Norton Antivirus) and run some patches and delete files and delete items in regedit.Now I get a 3 different errors when I start my computer, I can't do microsoft windows updates and Antivirus and antispam do not work. The support is very slow to respond and don't seem to know what they are doing.I will probably have to reformat my machine and start again"
1,"If There Were Less Than One Star, I'd Award It","Do not buy this product. While it advertizes compatibility with Eudora, it is not. It will not recognize Eudora 5.1 address files and subfiles as an ""Address Book,"" even though these are integral functions of Eudora, and suggests in the Symantec ""Knowldge Base"" [sic] that one reconfigure (hundreds?) of email addresses so that Eudora will work with Norton AntiSpam. The ""Knowledge Base"" suggests that the email files are ""corrupted."" This is not what I call ""compatible.""Further, when spam addresses are added to the ""blocked"" list, the program does not block them. Pretty nifty, eh?Also, the ""buttons"" for ""This is Spam"" and ""This is not Spam"" that appear in the Eurdora toolbar referring to Norton AntiSpam remain gray, that is, unselectable.I wouldn't even sell this in the ""used software"" market; I know I would be selling a ""lemon"" to someone else. It's unfortunate that I spent money on it. Please don't make the same mistake."
2,Will consistently crash Outlook if using multiple profiles,"This has been a known issue almost since the product launched and Symantec is aware of it...although they seem to deny that it's their problem.If you use multiple profiles in Outlook, Outlook will crash at startup with a Runtime Error message; only disabling/removing AntiSpam will allow you to open Outlook.See here (http://www.nocrash.com/ncbbs/msgs/3478.shtml) for additional comments from other users."
1,spam not removed,I had 3 cans of spam in my pantry. I installed this software in my dresser & the cans are still there. Enough said.
1,"It goes woof, woof.",It does not work with Netscape. Period. It does not stop SPAM. Use your money to light a cigar instead.
1,What A Pain!!!!,"What a worthless piece of trash. We experienced time outs down loading email 50 percent of the time running this program. The only way around it is to wait for the time out then turn Antispam off, get you email, turn Antispam back on pick the messages that are Spam, tell Norton, on and on and on-what a joke!! Want to fix it? Good luck, you will not get any help from Norton. Why in the world would they sell something like this is beyond me. We tossed 40 bucks right out the door with this one. Uninstalled and back to the hand removal method, The most irritating part is we have since found out Norton is fully aware of this problem ""bug"" that allows stammers to lock up the system with a null character. If they know this, why not fix it!!"
1,Could never connect to email server,"I had extremely bad luck with this product. After installation Outlook 2000 could not connect to the server. When I disabled AntiSpam it worked fine. I traded several emails with the support team, but there was very little help or useful insight into what was going on. I have a pretty basic system. Brand new Dell computer and I am using Outlook 2000 and Windows XP. I do have a router between the computer and the cable modem and although I suspected an issue there (and pointed the support personnel to that) there was never any suggestions on how that could be the problem."
1,Worst tech support ever,"I encountered frustrating difficulty with this product. It installed great and functioned fine -- until the next reboot. Then, Norton Antispam prevented me from getting to my mail servers. (This occurred on 2 computers, one with Windows XP Pro, the other Windows 98SE.)I checked out the Symantec knowledge base on its web site -- there was barely anything on Norton Antispam. I refused to spend the required $30 on phone support for a product that I consider deficient. It's not worth a single star, as far as I am concerned."
3,OutLook Express Problems,"I installed Norton AntiSpam 2004 on a new XP Machine that is running Outlook Express 6.0. The problem I have is that everytime I use the 'This is Spam' or 'This is not Spam' funciton, it kills Outlook and I have to reboot to get it back up. The (and I use the term loosley) 'support' web site acknowledged the problem but says it does not happen all the time. With mine, it happens everytime. I also do not think I should pay for support that costs nearly as much as the software. Oh well, as the other post mentioned, I should have known better than to purchase a 1.0 version of SW and suggest others wait for 1.1 or 2.0. I think their test department blew it on 1.0."
1,Garbage,"3 hours ago I installed this rubbish and I still can't access my Outlook mail. There is very little support apart from searching through tomes of databases and ""have you searched our FAQ's"" line of help. I could have deleted all the spam I have received in my life in the time I have spent trying to get this program to work. Having bought the software there is no way to get my money back, so this is tantamount to highway robbery. No wonder there are so many serial hackers around. This program IS spam!! Crap, packaged in a nice box."
5,A Lifesaver,"I avoided Norton Antispam because of the poor reviews at Amazon. I tried Spamwasher, and a couple others which I have mercifully forgotten. Nothing worked. They required me to read through the spams to see if I wanted to read them! No help at all.Then I got a new laptop with Norton Antipam 2004 installed. It worked great. Just what I wanted. It put spam, and nothing else, in a separate folder. No ""training"" or long setup was necessary. I then bought NAS for my desktop computer. It installed easily and works great.I don't know why this product gets poor reviews here. My experience has been absolutely excellent."
1,Slow and Not Very Effective,It takes far too long for the program to block an email that you just received. It is not that accurate. I would not use it if if was free.
1,Norton Internet Security - DON'T USE IT IF YOU USE OUTLOOK,"There is a known problem with NIS2004 and Outlook. Basically, they don't work properly together and you'll get a really irritating error message that closed Outlook down, you can then open it again when you try a second time. This means that EVERY time you want to use outlook, you have to open it twice as the first time says there's a runtime error.Symantec are aware of this and have been for months, but you'll see from various forums that they've done nothing about it. They must be happy to just make a fortune from their very expensive support line (the only way of contacting them!).You wont be able to get a refund from them either, even though their product is not fit for purpose. You'll need to contact your local Trading Standards department and commence Civil proceedings before they'll pay you back.My advice - DON'T BUY IT!"
2,Consistently crashes outlook with multiple profiles,"Symantec will not even admit that this is a bug but since I installed antispam 2004, it crashes outlook on a consistent basis. Not sure which is more annoying - that this happens or that Symantec know that it's there for the last 6 months & haven't even mentioned it on their support site."
1,Problems with Microsoft Outlook,"Don't even think about this product if you use Microsoft Outlook!!!! Continued crashing of my machine because of this product clashing with Outlook has cost me well over the purchase price. Once Symantec addresses the problem, I would become a loyal customer again, but this product should have not been brought to market without proper testing. And as with Microsoft products, I don't think the end-user should be the tester."
3,Norton Antispam - the good and the bad,"This product has me in a quandary. On the one hand it provides the simplest, and probably the best, integration with existing email programs. It also does a fine job of filtering. Unfortunately, this is at the penalty of system overhead. Be prepared for quite some slow down in internet access for both Web browsing and email sending. It seems that even if you switch off the options for Add and pop-up blocking, the functions are still operating. Since installing, both my Email, Web browsing has slowed by around 50%. The documentation is also very poor making it difficult to understand what is really implemented and modified within your system. Symantec would do better to restrict the functionality to Email spam blocking and forget, or allow proper configuration, of the additional features"
2,Runs and Works Great for about 1 week,"Works great if you can get it to run more that 1 week. After about a week the tool bar disappears from Outlook 2002, and the install program does not allow you to reinstall for repair, you have to uninstall - reboot - then reinstall again. Serves me right for buying a rev 1.0 of a program. I have reloaded this program about 5 times. Nothing about this problem on Symantec's site, and I am not going to pay 30 bucks phone support on a program I already paid 40 bucks for."
2,Crashes Outlook Express 6.0,"I installed this product on a new PC running XP and Outlook Express 6.0. The product works great except for the 'This is spam' and 'This is not spam'functions. When ever I use them, Express crashes with no error and I have to reboot the machine to get it back up. The (I use this term very loosely) support web site acknowledges the problem but says it only happens occasionally. On my system, it happens every time. They have no solution for the problem. I also do not think I should have to pay for support that will cost me as much as the software did itself. I think the testing department blew it on this one. Oh well, that is what I get for buying version 1.0. I would suggest that others wait for version 1.1 or 2.0, especially if they are using Outlook Express."
1,Piece of Junk,"I installed the software, and after the first reboot (like another person here) I started to have errors where it would no longer download my email from the POP3 server. If I disable the AntiSpam software and reboot, it works again! ALSO, it broke my Norton AntiVirus software, which still doesn't work! Norton not working with Norton - go figure! Do not buy this, at least wait for another version so they can figure out their issues!"
1,Consistently crashes outlook with multiple profiles,"Every since I installed antispam 2004, it crashes outlook on a consistent basis. Symantec has not even posted this on there website and there Support help is pathetic. The software is annoying it the worst ways. First, Outlook 2002 crashes every time you login to the profile and Symantec knows that it's there for well over 8 months and has yet to neither acknowledge it nor fix it."
2,A Good Program - If you don't like getting ANY email!,"I bought Norton Antispam without a moments hesitation based on a review in PC World magazine. That was a big mistake. IT integrates with Outlook very well and creates an Antispam folder that it automatically sends the spam to.Problem is you have to sort through it VERY carefully EVERYTIME you get mail. It sends all my good emails there too. Despite the fact the in the aformentioned folder you can press a new button titled, ""THIS IS NOT SPAM"", which sends it back to the in box.I try and try and press that button over and over again on emails from the same address and still...everytime they go straight in to the antispam folder. I even set it to LOW LEVEL DETECTION (one of only three choices.) Still no luck.I was happy with Mail Washer Pro and will now go back to it."
1,Did they ever test this? Where is quality control?,"I purchased this product to help with my unbelievable spam problem. I was trying some other spam software, but really wanted to have it integrated into outlook express version 6.For years I have used Symantec products, believed they were of highest quality. Unfortunately, this particular one is not the case.After I installed this, It found some of my incoming spam. When you try to tell it ""this is spam"" OE will crash, requiring a complete reboot (Win2k even). I have installed all the updates, and after reading these reviews, I am not alone.I now just forward all of my mail to my trash and pick it from there. Maybe I will look at other competing products, but won't blindly purchase protection products from Symantec any more.Sorry..."
1,This software sucks!,"If I could give this software less than one star I would.If you dont beleave me read the 66+ messages tell you this software sucks too. If you really need spam control.I recomend just changing your mail client to thunderbird. http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/it's free, it's fast, It works, has a great spam filter built in.If you really want to throw away $40. heck just set it on fire.or better ye just send it to me. I have to find a way to get back the cash I spent on this pile of trash."
2,Proceed with caution,"First, let me say that the anti-spam features work. After the install, my spam dropped from over 200 message per day to nearly zero, with NAS 2004 accurately zapping the spam messages. My inbox suddenly became manageable again.Now for the bad news. My PC, a Toshiba laptop with Windows XP Home, had been rock solid for eighteen months. Rarely any type of crash or problem. In the 24 hours since I installed NAS 2004, I have had a ""blue screen of death"" crash/reboot, numerous errors with the print spooler, and a couple of ""A serious error has occurred"" messages from various applications. Felt like I was back to using Windows 98.So, with regret, I have uninstalled NAS 2004. Maybe they'll get this cleaned up in NAS 2005."
1,Trouble with Outlook Profiles,I run Windows 2000 Pro with Outlook 2000. Antispam 2004 does not work right when running with multiple Outlook profiles. Symantec doesn't seem to be addressing the issue either. Lot's of folks have raised the issue with them.
1,Its just crap.,"This package has got to be THE worse software package I have ever wasted my hard won money on. First, it gets blown away by updates and service packs to IE and Outlook Express. Second, itlocks up on one of my email accounts every time. And now, it just does not filter at all. Flaky,Support is non-existent. You can email them and they say they might get back in 5 days or so. Great. You stole my money, never again!"
1,Don't waste your time if running W98,"I have been a Norton customer for years and expected AntiSpam to help solve the spam problem. Didn't work as promised. The program refused to allow safe passage of email when instructed and deleted important messages at random. Its installation also corrupted some of Norton's own files, requiring a re-installation of the entire Systemworks package. When I contacted Symantec the tech admitted that they have problems with Windows 98. They refunded the purchase price, but it was a bad experience."
4,Enter a world of fantasy,"This is a very original book, devoted to just one rare but extraordinary tactical idea - one player sacrifices both his Rooks on the first rank. This sacrifice is extremely uncommon and the resulting positions resemble a world of fantasy where normal chess strategies don't apply. Even so, there are many different and practical tactical tips the reader will find very instructive. This book, containing exciting games with vivid insights, will bring many hours of enjoyment."
5,Excellent,"This is an excellent product, and it does exactly what it says it does. It gently buffs out those irritating swirls that somehow develop over time in the finish of every car. I use a Porter Cable 7424XP buffer, and it makes for a great combination. I've recently started using more and more Meguiar's products,and I haven't been disappointed."
1,I didn't even get the book,They refunded my book! And I needed it for school so now I'm in trouble. Why they post an option and then don't give it to you is annoying and harmfull. Oh well serves me right for using online shiping for school books.
4,This book is a Game Plan,"When my wife bought this book I was intrigued. I was one of those guys who thought that it was up to mothers to drive their kids back and forth to and from sports, pack snacks and fundraise but that was about it. After reading Home Team Advantage, I realized I was dead wrong: there is a whole lot moms can and should be doing beyond simply chauffeurs; that perhaps if we included womens's perspective, our kids would be having more fun playing sports. I am the director of a youth football league and will encourage all of the coaches to read this book-- simply put it is a blueprint for a succesful season."
4,"good info, shipped very fast","i got this for my wife. she is already very involved and i thought this would do 2 things; confirm her hard work and appreciation from both our kids and their teammates, myself and other parents by showing how important she is; and possibly give her some additional ideas and support from other moms who put so much time and energy into their kids activities (not limited to sports but things like band, scouts, and other things). we are already doing a lot of things in the book and it is nice to see that she is contributing to the lives of not just our kids, but many others. this would be a great book for someone with small children just getting into sports or other activites to give some insight on what to really expect as far as time and committment, but also what a truly important role you can play in the developement of your children. you can't beat the price and it shipped very quick."
2,Hypocritical!,"Chapter after chapter we hear about how ""winning at all cost,"" over-competitiveness and how kids specialize in a sport way too soon (before high school varsity level), the author goes against every piece of advice she's given. She admits that when her young sons were faced with a soccer league that was competitive and *gasp* co-ed, instead of allowing them to play, she started her own league! What? It took away the credibility of the entire book. I just can't listen to ""do as I say, not as I do.""(Note: this review was based on an uncorrected publishers' proof.)"
3,free upgrade?,"obviously, semi-metallic brake pads are worthy of a 3, tops. probably some of you would expect to see a 2. nonetheless, i have nothing but positive things to say about my shopping experience itself.namely, centric part 105.07360 is, in fact, a set of ceramic brake pads, and not simply semi-metallic. the box is sitting right here on my floor with the UPC code printed on the side: next to the part number and the word ""ceramic."" this is not penciled in or some such thing; it is part of the inking on the box itself.i had purchased this item through amazon expecting to save a few bucks compared to [...], and i would have -- but i apparently also got a free upgrade to a slightly higher quality product. five stars for that!"
2,"Good but Pricey Intro, Much Better Alternatives","As a practicing certified systems engineer in a major corporation with a very large network of NT servers and workstations and a variety of other systems, the only tools I've found useful in the Resource Kits are those involving deployment. Ghost and Ghost Walker, however, have completely replaced them. QUE's MCSE TestPrep Core Exams and other volumes on Windows NT are better written, far more extensible, and better targeted for everyone from the beginning through the professional user."
4,indispensable for NT Server administrators,This is the documentation that Microsoft shouldhave included with every copy of NT Server.Every administrator should have this kit. Thetools are userful and the documentation essential.
1,"Great for management, terrible for techies","This book gives a good overview of IIS4, but if you actually want to know how it works and how to use it to publish your site, forget it. There are no technical details at all, just loads of 'microsoft are the best' brainwashing. I was not impressed. want to know how it works and how to use it to publish your site, forget it. There are no technical details at all.'microsoft are the best'. I was not impressed"
3,Non-descriptive,Compared with the 3.5x resource kit this one was rather weak. It seems to be focused to the first time NT user rather than the technical one
1,"Heavy on generalities, short on reality","Try getting a server application running using this book is very difficult. If you memorize all the books in this offering, you still will not be able to get an application up on the server."
1,Not quite right,"I thought this seat was wonderful when we bought it, but my after my daughter threw up on it and I had to take the whole thing apart, it's never been quite right again. The seat belt guides at the shoulder won't stay inserted into the back of the carseat-they just keep popping back out. Now she had a pee pee accident and I'm sure it'll be even worse after diassembling it again. With little kids stuff happens and you've got to have a carseat that can be washed and reassembled and still work. I'm going back to Graco."
2,Medical Student Text,"After reading two favorable reviews I purchased this book for my Kindle (Please Amazon publish more Anesthesia texts on Kindle). I quickly read through this book realizing early that the depth of the text was on par with medical student level education. If the ""Baby Miller"" (Miller and Soelting's Basics of anesthesia) is held as the the basic text for CA1 (Clinical Anesthesia year 1) residents, then this book falls far far short. Any CA1 or even intern depending on this book to get them introduced to anesthesia is behind the power curve and needs to reconsider their chosen profession. On the other hand medical students who would like an introduction to the basics of anesthesia may want borrow this book from the library."
1,"Cheap, Baggy",Not like other Antigua products. The cut is terrible--there's no way to wear it without looking like you're swimming in it.
1,Hogwash!,"Don't get taken in by this nonsense, Folks! These claims that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene, are taken from the Gnostic Gospels, which are purely heretical and totally without validity! As a Catholic, I was outraged to see in one of the reviews of this book, that a ""supposed"" Catholic priest has claimed that these false allegations are true. I say, supposed, because I cannot believe that a REAL priest would condone such blasphemies!This alleged priest says that Mary Magdalene was the First Lady of the Christian Community and the Model of the Church. Get real! Those titles apply to our Blessed Mother, Mary, the mother of Jesus, not Mary Magdalene! So much for his knowledge!The Holy Grail, Mary Magdalene! How much drivel does the author of this ridiculous book expect us to swallow? The Holy Grail was the chalice used by Jesus at the Last Supper. Period!This book and others of its kind belong in the TRASH!"
3,I had to mark this book down because....,"it contained a HUGE mistake. Starbird's definition of Mary's (BVM that is, not Mary Magdalene) Immaculate Conception is that Mary's parents didn't sin in the act of conceiving her. First, as warped as the Catholic church is about sex, it does not consider procreational sex a sin. What the Immaculate Conception actually means is that Mary was conceived with original sin on her soul. As fascinating as I found this book, because of that gigantic error, I have to question almost everything else in it. Another mistake she made was calling Jesus ""Jesus of Nazareth."" She uses ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail"" as a major source of her research, yet in that book, the authors explain how and why that title is erroneous. I really hate to be so nitpicky because I DID enjoy this book - but when I come across such inaccuracies in this type of book that needs all the ""ammunition"" it can muster for its unorthodox theories, I feel the need to point them out."
4,Such an Interesting Read,"In ""The Woman With the Alabastar Jar: Mary Magdalene and the Holy Grail,"" author Margaret Starbird attempts to prove that the Holy Grail was infact Mary Magdalene because her womb carried the seed of Christ.I found this book to be very interesting. Starbird delves deep into the myth of the Holy Grail and presents evidence supporting her theory that the Holy Grail was Mary Magdalene and the royal bloodline she fostered through the children she produced through her marriage to Jesus Christ. Starbird's arguments are very compelling and she backs up her claims through some extremely intriguing ways (art, literature, watermarkings, localized custom, etc.). It's also interesting to note that Starbird set out to prove this theory false and ended up a believer."
2,Weak feminist theory,"The book is an exponent of Starbird's feminist theory. The reason the book has been well received is because the subject is taboo although not new. It is also a great source of revenues.Many other authors have presented the same idea in more eloquent terms. Her writing is one of fragmented thoughts put together and repetition of ideas.Despite the fact that the book begins very nicely it goes downhill after the first chapter. Those of us that have closely studied the makings of the Catholic Church find the book a weak proponent of a theory without actual support. Hence, the proof provided is weak, vague, and has no merit."
1,Fantasy,"One of the reviews refers to Starbird as a ""preeminant theologian and New Testament scholar."" On what planet? I promise you not a single Theologian or New Testament scholar of any merit even knows who this woman is. Not because some evil church empire is suppressing the knowledge; rather, her work is fantasy. If you just read the Da Vinci Code and think this is some kind of scholarly backing and you've never read any real scholarship in the field then I sympathize with you for being duped. Read something like N.T. Wright's ""Jesus and the Victory of God"" to get an idea what real engagement with the New Testament and early church literature is like."
3,"Precarious speculation, Read SB 1 or God instead.","Once again the research done to connect Mary and Jesus is done out of blind background history. The entire scope of research here is nothing more than possibilities based on acceptable tradition at the time of Christ. From the research done here there are absolutely no direct solid connections to Mary and Jesus, it is all specualtion at best and dismal. I recommend a good read concerning the Grail, SB 1 or God by Maddox"
1,Old news - and boring,"I first heard this idea back in 1968 from a friend who was convinced. It sounded intriguing to me, so I began a very long and exhaustive search for the truth. What I found was that the ""truth"" really isn't there. Lots of opinions over time are, however. These somehow get sanctified by time, and then quoted as evidence! In fact, maybe Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married, maybe they weren't. . . there is no real way to know. Bottom line: it really isn't important one way or the other. The important thing is what He taught."
1,The Woman With Th Alabaster Jar,"There are numerous works out now exploring the theme and person of Mary Magdalen. Unfortunately this is not one of the better ones. Unconvicing, surprisingly dull and sentimental. Too much goddess worship. A far better work is the one by Susan Hoskins. Mary was truly the disciple to the disciples and an example of the radical rediscovery of women in society, but the rest of this is tiresome."
1,Not Great,"This work explores some fascinating ideas about the identity and role of Mary Magdalen. From the perspective of one who does not have an extensive background in Christian theory, however, the book is difficult to follow, wandering in it's points and repetitive. Those well versed in theology might possibly have a different take."
2,That Bird Ain't No Star,"Pretty poorly written, repetitive, confusing, seems slightly bootlegged and almost too contrived. The author is too deeply rooted in orthodox Christianity in order to even make a run for the alternative. I love the subject matter though - that's why I bought this book. I am slightly disappointed to say the least."
1,"POOR SCHOLARSHIP, misses the obvious","I cannot tell you just how many times this author misses the mark. But just the title alone should show you how poor the research is. The Luke 7:37 clearly says that the woman was from that town. That excludes the Magdalene. The same passage says the woman was a sinner. That excludes Mary of Bethany (sister of Martha and Lazarus). The Passage from Mark 14 is unnamed, if it was someone as important as either Mary of Bethany OR Mary Magdalene, it would have been mentioned. It goes on and on from there. This is clearly a book written to capitalize of Dan Brown's better researched, but brilliantly written fiction, the Da Vinci code. WHen ever a blockbuster appears, there are inevetably ""poor cousins"" that appear hoping to pick up the scraps."
3,The Woman with the Alabaster Jar,"She presents interesting research but her writing style is somewhat disjointed. This makes it difficult at times to follow her train of thoughts. There have been a few instances where she has gone back to the initial theme with an ""oh yes I need to tie it in"" attitude. It has taken me a while to finish it because it is not enthralling as I had hoped having read several other books with this theme."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this book because I was intrigued by the title, but I was very disappointed in the contents. The author has obviously done her research, but I sure wish she could have presented it better. I found parts of it very repetitive (where was the editor?). I found many of the ""connections"" to be very very speculative at best. (When someone takes words from one language, reverses the letters, and points to the similarity to a word in another language, I get very nervous.) All in all, the best part of the book was the introduction by Sweeney. Nevertheless, I still find the subject interesting enough to pursue, and intend to read some of the sources that the author points to."
4,Side A and Side B Music and spoken word,"This follow up to Pieces of Man is not for everyone. I don't think it was a weak album but I for one was always more a fan of GSH music than straight poetry or spoken word, although I enjoyed the latter nevertheless. In Free Will there is one song that is a hauntingly poingnant reminder of America's past. I think about it every Veterans day. ""Did you hear what they said ?"" is worth the price of admission. I love the piano and flute work on Free Will. I haven't heard this version yet (buying it soon) but I am curious about the alternate takes. I have to say though that very often when I hear alternate takes, I'm glad somebody picked the ones they picked as the lead versions! But let me say that if you are a GSH spoken word or lyrics fan, you will not be dissapointed. The power of his writing is as strong here as anywhere else on his recorded work."
5,Hope from an unofficial source,I bought this for a friend. It came highly recommended from another friend. An alternative to a medical system which now offers mind and body numbing pills almost exclusively aimed at controlling - not curing - mental illness. It is certainly at least worth a try.
4,Strangeways newbee,"After stumbling across a youtube clip of these guys, I thort that this wasnt half bad for a group of scots. after finding more tracks from the same album (walk in the fire) I wanted it and found it on amazon. All the tracks on the cd are very cool esp in the car with the windows down on a hot day..............BUT i didnt like the 2 bonus live tracks (so far away and where do we go from here). To my ears they didnt quite fit in with the polish of the studio tracks. other than that a good cd and big ups to amazon for a smooth purchase"
2,the french text,"HI i'm a french studient and I studie this book in the Arras University ( Arras is near of Cambrai) Unluckily, I never read the American translation but I can you say that the original text is boring because the author, Chrétien de Troyes, repeats enormously the same sentences, and we are under the impression that the story doesn't progress."
4,Great Value,This phone is a great value for the money and works very well. I purchased 8 and changed all the phones in my house. Only draw back is receiver is a bit uncomfortable and sits poorly on the base unit. It is very easy for the phone to be off the hook.
5,A great Caller ID option if you want have an AC connection,"I've had this phone in service about six weeks as a wall mount with no problems. I'm still on the original batteries, and they'll last longer if you keep the display as dim as possible but still readable.This is the perfect option for those who want a Caller I.D. phone but don't want to plug into an electrical outlet. In fact, it's the ONLY two-line phone I could find that will do this.Speech quality is fine, and it's extremely user-friendly. I'm not at all disappointed."
1,Do not purchase this for an office,"We've been using these phones for a few months and they are horrible phones if there is any sound around the office. If there is noise around the office, it will pickup on the headset and you can't hear anything. We're looking to replace these phones currently."
2,Great feature poor reliability,"I bought two of these phones. They have all the features I want (speakerphone, mute button, hold button, caller ID) but I have to give it two stars because the first phone died after a few months and the second after about two years."
1,In the dark,"It is very difficult to read the printing on this phone, especially in low light. If mounted on a wall slightly below eye level, it's almost impossible to read. If you buy this phone, buy a flashlight to go with it. I did not see this problem in the store since the lighting was very bright."
1,Design Fault Likely,"I bought this model to replace a slightly earlier GE model (probably 29060) and had an immediate problem. My fax machine wouldn't work through its data port. Believing the phone was at fault I got a replacement, but the problem persisted.My telephone service is a single line (RJ11C) which must have an in-lineDSL filter to work with the analog fax and ordinary telephone. The fax works fine when directly connected to the wall outlet but not through either line 1 or 2 on the phone. My only conclusion is that the dataport doesn't work for a single line hook up.I called Thompson customer service about this but they were clueless.They can only give a replacement, not a refund, which is pointless in this case."
2,Only advantage is price.,"Well, it's a phone. You can pick up the phone and make a phone call.You can have two lines into the phone and press a button to switch between lines.But, if that's all you want, just buy two $8 phones.Problems I have with this phone:- I bought it primarily for the speaker phone functionality. The speaker phone sucks. It is very difficult for anyone on the other end of the call to hear me.- The caller ID will NOT work with rechargeable AA batteries.- The speaker phone button is annoying. In order to answer a call with it, you have to press and hold the button for two seconds, then release it. If you just press it, and then see the light flash and release, the caller just gets disconnected. I have no idea why you would make a phone where the light goes on when the phone isn't actually going to connect you.- The caller ID display is very difficult to read unless you have the right lighting and are looking at the right angle.- This phone is made of cheap plastic."
1,Worst Phone EVER,"I have never placed a product review before - but this is one of those products where I would NEVER buy again. The sound quality is horrendous. We have done everything thinking maybe it was our phone line so we replaced inside wires, outlets, etc. Another phone works perfectly but this one you can barely hear over the terrible static. Avoid."
1,Low Quality,"If you are on line one and a call comes into line two, you have significant background noise while the second line is active. In-call volume controls are not intuitive. Overall, I am sorry I bought this phone."
4,An oldie but a goodie,"Good value for the price in an old fashioned corded phone. Has nice big buttons, good sound and comfortable hand set. No unnecessary gimics."
2,Disapointed,Nomads Dream has been my signature color for years. I don't know if this polish was old or mislabeled but it was notNomad's Dream.
1,Complete waste of money,"I can't believe this is still being offered, this book is a complete waste of time. It looks like a collection of old memo paper wrapped around a red cover and overpriced. For the price of this you could get Phil's short game dvd'sPhil Mickelson ""Secrets of the Short Game"" Golf Training DVDor Tom Watson's Lessons for a LifetimeTom Watson Lessons of a LifeTime Golf 2 Disc DVD. I cannot say this enough....SAVE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE"
1,"When the range opens, I'll get back to you.","It's a fast read, due to large print and spacing. That's good, because it's good not to waste much time on this book, but I will reserve final judgement until I've had more time to work on it, only because I did hit it very straight at times on the brief vist to my winter range. For now, though, I think it's a big waste of a tree."
3,Put it in your reference section,"Read the introduction to get the gist of this book. The rest is sometimes painful, sometimes silly, often defensive and always very self-centered. I had to give up and will keep the book as reference, which is where diaries and letters belong."
2,What a disappointment.,"In the last pages of this memoir, Rick Moody expresses his worry about ""leaving something out."" Yeah, Rick, you left YOURSELF out of your own memoir. Though Rick's experiences of alcoholism are interesting and self-reflective, the weaved in literary criticism of Hawthorne's parable attenuate any emotional potential of the memoir. We can feel bad for Rick, but we better shut up quickly and think deeply about his examination of what the black veil means. Also, as one reviewer pointed out, Rick just seems wordy here. He actually writes sentences like, ""i don't know how to describe this..."" Well then don't!Ahh.... . the days of The Ice StormHowever, after reading the first chapter of this book (even the first page), you will think you are in for a treat. So it is worth just reading the first chapter in a book store."
2,A Really Black Veil,"I hesitate to write anything negative after reading the editorial claim for ""one of the most admired writers of his generation"" who has written a ""searing, brilliantly acclaimed memoir"", but alas... . I was interested in reading the book based on its premise and an interview with the author I heard over NPR. Unfortunately, after I slogged through one-third of it, I paged through the rest trying to find something to restore my initial enthusiasm, but without success. His memories, insights, experiences, and writing seemed no more interesting than my own or those of any blogger on the face of the planet. If there is a lesson, it is probably that depressed people are depressingly uninteresting."
3,lovely voice,"ok, i'm just discovering the Pointer Sisters, i was a baby in they're heyday the 80's.. this lp was released on Motown which explains why it's more or less a tribute album to HDH holland dozier holland, bonnie wrote on one song ""deep inside my soul"" Her voice is sultry and relaxed, not gritty and soulful like the Pointer Sisters...Basically it's motown revamping itself with a mild-disco-like remakes....it kinda reminds me of somthing ""naked music"" would do. it's pleasant to say the least."
3,"A couple of good hits, but she'd probably have been better off staying with her sisters","For those who may not know this, there are actually 4 Pointer Sisters, not 3, but second-youngest Bonnie (born in 1950) broke away to pursue a solo career which began with this album for Motown. She had a couple of sizable hits from it with ""Heaven Must Have Sent You"" and ""Free Me From My Freedom"" both of which are great songs. However, as a whole, this album is not quite on par with late 70s Pointer Sisters material, as nothing else on the album quite measures up to the hits."
3,Anode rod package.,Rod must have been damaged in transit and was returned to supplier before I ever received it. Second one did arrive but it was also bent. Should be better packaged. Its only soft alum. and needs more than bubble wrap around it. Would think a cardboard tube would be better..
1,Disappointment,"I think Barbara Cook has a very interesting life story, but unfortunately this boring television interview doesn't capture it. I would have much preferred to see more of her outstanding ""Mostly Sondheim"" tour rather than the few snippets contained. In short: Love Barbara Cook, couldn't hardly wait for this DVD to end."
2,Human Guinea Pigs?,"The book suggests that there are limits to the permissibility of experimants on humans. It points out how it has become a comman occurrence for medical investigators to take risks with patients of which the patients themselves are frequently unaware, and to submit them to mental and physical distress and possible hazards which in no way are necessitated by or have conection with the treatment of the diease from which they are suffering."
4,Tripp lite isolation transformer,"Transformer was as expected, and in good shape. The packaging was not sufficient. The unit arrived via UPS with the top of the light weight box torn open, and the transformer visible."
3,Too Fast For Me,"Actually, this is an excellent reference. Techniques are described simply and completely. My problem with it is they start on second base and I'm trying to get to first. Many terms are referred to but not explained. I'm sure that with another starter book (I recommend How To Use Adobe Photoshop CS) to get me going, I will use 10 Steps or Less and find it very helpful. Also the lack of color illustrations makes it difficult to see some of the changes being explained."
5,Way better than I thought it would be,"When I went to rent this yesterday in the 20th anniversary edition, I wasn't expecting alot, but I liked it so much I ended up buying it. I'm gonna buy some of the other Police Academy movies too."
2,"Tired cliches, weak slapstick, and embarrassing stereotypes","I've seen this movie around for years, and never got around to watching it. Its persistence made me wonder if it had the originality and comedy of, say,National Lampoon's Animal House,Airplane!, orCaddyshack.It doesn't. 'Nuff said."
5,one of the best comedy movies ever made!,This movie is a must see for those who enjoy comedy. Anyone who gives this movie a bad review must lead a very serious and boring life. I recomend this movie to anyone who enjoys laughter therapy and living life to its fullest.
4,one of the best comedies of the eighties,"Although it was made to poke fun at cops, this movie does more than that. It pokes fun at all of us and makes ou8r lives a little less drab. Thanks for the memories. By the way, six more films was a little (lot) too much."
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A stupid comedy that is sophomoric at best and moronic at worst, Police Academy has probably only garnered its status as a ""classic"" because its sequels are so poorly-regarded that even this looks good by comparison; please don't watch this when there are literally thousands of better movies you could spend your time or money on."
1,Turn off the lights on your way out!,"When I first saw this movie in the theater, I thought it was (at the time) the worst movie I'd ever seen. Not only were people walking out of the theater, they were slamming the door on the way out!"
5,Super Funny,One of the comedy police series out there. you never would want mess with tackleberry. the worst candidates end up being the police. watch if you have never seen this before.
3,Original Academy,"This is a classic from my childhood. The Police Academy is accepting anyone, and the characters that turn up are hilarious. Every one a little bit different, every one a little bit unique! It's not the best of the Police Academy series (that's number two) but it makes me laugh aloud every time I watch it. This is perfect for a Sunday afternoon dvd session, and won't leave you disappointed. Good for the whole family."
5,sad nun at synon,This book takes you to the begining of liberal alchohl and drug sobriety with tough love from a tough wise nun.
1,The cover is deceptive,This book is really disappointing because none of the images are in color. I'm not sure how a publisher can create a Black & White book on art that is based on color -- Polish Folk Design is completely based on color. All art books sold on Amazon should clearly mark if the book is Color or B/W.
5,lovely patterns,"I bought this book because I make quilts and wanted to have some patterns from the book. As it turns out, I will most likely use the pattern from the front cover, but there are many inside that would work as well. It is all black and white inside, but with quilting, it doesn't matter; indeed, it might be better than color, so a quilter could imagine her own colors. Lovely book."
1,let down,"I guess I was expecting some color images, I learned more about design and concept by googling wyncinanki images. The images are way too primative for myself. Personally not worth the money and anticipation."
4,good snake,I needed to get a patchbay hooked up to an old Tascam board. This snake did the trick. It seems very well constructed and the color-coded runs are very helpful.
4,Nice Fit,Fit is great in my 2005 Ford Escape. Would rate it 5 of 5 if the carpet material had a deeper pile but otherwise great.
5,THIS IS A MUST READ!,"This is such a great book! I really liked Robin, the main character, and his dog Ruff. I also learned a lot about Shakespeare. When I first read the book I could not put it down! It is so amusing and from every page you turn something amazing happens! If there is anyone out there looking for a good book to read, get The Wonderful Winter. It will keep you interested for hours."
4,Good collection,A good collection for readers interested in England and also well written stories. High quality tales.
2,"Weak film, one great fight scene","What's wrong with this movie? Hmm, where to begin... how about the fact that the main weapon of choice in the film is guns. That's right I said guns. Wong Fei Hung, Clubfoot and crew jump around performing martial arts and then shooting people dead. It makes no sense whatsoever and is totally out of character for Fei Hung who, in one scene, shoots a woman in the eye and kills her. Then there's the fact that the movie drags on and on with TERRIBLE comedy scenes that make you wish someone would shoot you in the eye and end the misery. The only thing saving this film from a one star rating is one AWESOME figth scene where Wong Fei Hung battles an ancient kung fu master in a massive treasure chamber. Very cool but definely not worth the purchase price."
3,The Book vs. The Author,"Barbara Olsen died a brave and tragic death, and is rightly commemmorated for it. But that does not mean her final work should go without scrutiny.Olsen was one of the smartest of the recent crop of female conservative pundits, and I always found her insightful. But she had an anger about her that sometimes clouded rational argument. That unfortunate quality is on display in this book.The shenanigans of the last days of the Clinton Administration were pretty blatant -- even once-loyal Democrats were appalled. It seems, then, that an objective, almost detached, examination of that period would have been more effective. Olsen instead deploys rancor and emotion. The result: The book comes off as one more right-wing attack, not a factual assessment of very real dirty doings."
4,Barbara would be proud of her accomplishment,"Some readers would accuse her of hate. Barbara simply exposed truth that we as a people are often too busy or careless to look into. Is it hate to expose that so many were released from prison on the last days of a Presidency?To keep our people free we need to care about what happens in our government. This book has a lot of sources, and quotes are usually without right wing invective. I think Barbara's book hit the mark on information we needed to know about for our future. But alas, America tends to forget.May we remember Barbara and her life, she died on 9-11, she was on the plane that crashed into the Pentagon."
2,Entertaining but unconvincing,"It is of course tragic that Barbara Olsen perished on 9/11, but nevertheless I must say that while I looked forward to this book because I want to believe the worst about Bill and Hillary, and while it was entertaining for putting them in a bad light, I didn't really find it convincing from a research/evidentiary point of view. For one, the author's bias was all too evident; for another, many of the points seemed to be just rehashed public domain material or speculation. Put another way, sure the Clinton's probably did some bad stuff in their final days, but this book hardly lives up to its promise to show them as serious abusers of power."
1,Political pamphlet,"Where this tome may provide some entertainment on a dull flight, don't fool yourself into thinking that this is a 'Book'. Political pamphlet is the better term and a rather crude one at that. The author's extreme right wing philosophy drips from every page (no exaggeration)thereby destroying any credibility her statements might otherwise have.No biased rumor is too vague, no 'liberal' intention too suspicious to serve as a reliable basis for pointing the finger at another 'liberal outrage'. That the man, Clinton, might have any redeeming value at all is too preposterous to contemplate.No matter what your political views are, this is a junky book, probably written in less time than your flight."
1,Rehash from a has-been,"The late Barbara Olson reveals nothing new in this book---precisely because she has previously made no secret of her hatred for the Clintons both politically and personally.Everything that has been printed can easily be found in other authors works on the same subject, and therefore only accomplished the task of depleting a forrest and printer cartridges. While this assessment ironically does lend credence to the idea that anybody can become published in this country if they are sensational and partisan enough, it also reveals a very embittered spoiled woman who was almost fanatical in her disregard for the very concept of ethics she was bent on investigating others for violating."
1,No Time for Hate,"If you are considering buying this book, you might want to first fill your heart with hate (if you haven't already done so) and stop by for that brainpickling appointment that you have put off for so long. Otherwise you might find it difficult to understand how someone writing such an obviously biased attack could actually get published. Nobody's saying Bill and Hillary are sqeaky clean here, but if Ronald Reagan receiving a multimillion dollar house in Bel Air and million dollar speaking engagements just post presidency doesn't set off alarm bells, why should we worry about amateurs like the Clintons?"
3,Some Example for America,"Barbara Olson was certainly no fan of the Clintons. However, she does show fairness in this book by agreeing that there was justification for some pardons by Clinton. She also quotes some liberal Democrats who express their disgust with Clinton's last minute pardon escapade. She does point out that these same Democrats could not bring themselves to condemn Clinton for some of the earlier scandals while she maintains that the pardoning and White House furniture scandals of the last days of his term were only a continuation of the character displayed in the earlier sexual scandals. The Marc Rich pardon of course receives special attention in the book and leaves one wondering how someone with integrity could justify such a pardon of one who at the time was on one of the Justice Department's ""most wanted"" lists.Sometimes there is a little too much detail such as several pages listing the names of the pardoned. But overall, I found the book both interesting and informative."
3,No laughing matter to say the very least!,"I always viewed Bill Clinton as being a great politician and I don't think some people won't disagree with that... BUT his character's weaknesses, his lack of self control (sexually speaking)his lies, not to mention his bad judgment regarding the pardons he gave to corrupt crooks, make me wonder why on earth that guy was elected for a second term. But,if Mrs. Olson would be with us today, I wonder what she would say about what's going on today with Mr.G.W.Bush... I don't think any president was an angel and each and everyone of them had their weaknesses and we are not going to go into that, because everyone knows... so Bill Clinton was not better or worst than any other president before him."
5,"Packed with interesting, proven facts.","From beginning to end, Barbara proves every statement via a footnote/index. She shows the Clintons for how they operated and what they did. The ""why"" becomes obvious. Barbara wanted us to know the truth and anyone who is not afraid of it will see it clearly. Her legacy to us could be a warning for our future.(...)"
4,A Catalogue of Iniquities.,"The last days of the Clintons were an occasion for the country to witness just how corrupt this two for the price of one team actually was. They took furniture and gifts that were not their's for the taking, and appeared to be granting pardons on the basis of what law breakers held the most influence within their circle of friends and family. From arsenic to Mark Rich, the whole squalid tale is recounted by the superlative Barbara Olso, who sadly is no longer with us."
2,Good while it lasted,"This was a great mouse for the 4 months that it work correctly. The scroll wheel just went out.So much for the ""Revolutionary hyper-fast scroll wheel""We will see how the warranty goes...."
4,An excellent wireless mouse,"I have never used a wireless mouse before, so I was apprehensive ordering one. However, I have had no problem adjusting to it, and find it an improvement from the wired one and easy to use."
1,Very disappointed,"Close to returning this item. To date, it does not operate smoothly. I have tried it on 3 different surfaces. Oddly, it will work fairly well for awhile then become unsatisfactory. Move it to a different surface, same thing again. I have been in contact with Logitec a few times and have reviewed the online manual to no avail. I'll try for another day or 2. BTW, I have tried other mice I have and all work fine. I gave it a high score for battery because it's advertised to last up to a year. If anyone has any ideas, please advise asap. Thanks!"
5,Super Mouse from Amazon.com,This is the second MX620 Cordless Laser Mouse I have owned. I misplaced the USB receiver for my first one and had to buy a replacement mouse because I couldn't find out how to buy just a receiver. The ergonomic shape of the mouse and ease of use is outstanding.
1,good mouse... if it worked,"I bought mine a little less than 6 months ago, and throughout this time I have had the pleasure of the jerking movements of my cursor, the middle click just not working at times, and the failure of the left click (then the fixing of the left click!... then the second failure... then the fix!... awaiting third failure). It's a comfortable mouse, it fits well in the palm of my hand. The buttons on the side are comfortable and responsive. The scroll is very nice and feels like an expensive piece of hardware. But the mouse just doesn't work well. It stops working at the most inopportune times, somehow fixes itself only to break once again in a couple of weeks. I liked the mouse when it wasn't sucking. My experience with logitech products has been very good, until I encountered this mouse. I was extremely disappointed with the mouse."
4,liking it so far,"just started using it a couple weeks ago. so far, it's been pretty good. i would like it if the mousewheel gave a little more resistance on each turn/click, whatever you call it."
3,Exchanged for new MX Revolution,"I bought this mouse, but after some research discovered that the MX Revolution is essentially the same with better features. The MX has a thumb rest and a 3-way programmable thumb wheel. I don't use the wheel much, but the thumb rest is neat. Besides, who could resist owning the world's most advanced mouse."
3,Shame about the wheel,"I really like the way this mouse feels in my hand - its definitely smooth and install on Vista x64 was a breeze.Problem is that the wheel does not have any stops. It moves very smoothly but I find it hard to scroll easily - especially in apps like Google Maps where the scroll controls the zoom. When the wheel stops, the scroll continues for a fraction longer.Even with the SetPoint software its not controllable, neither can you disable the wheel entirely.If you can live with that limitation (I can't) then you will love this mouse."
1,Kept Losing Connection,"This mouse kept losing its connection. I moved the USB receiver to the front of my computer, 1 foot away from the mouse, direct line-of-sight. Frequent ""hiccups"" were the norm. After about a month of this, I scrapped it and got a Razer Diamondback 3G for the same money. What a welcome relief!"
1,Disappointing,"The company I ordered from had to send me four before one worked. This is no joke. Beware of this product. If I were Logitech, I would be embarrassed to market such garbage."
1,Horrible Mouse for the Mac,"I bought this mouse with very high expectations based on my previous experiences with Logitech mice. I have to say that I was extremely disappointed. First of all, the Logitech Control Center for the Mac is buggy, and Logitech still has not fixed it. More frustrating though is the wheel on this mouse- it's extremely loose. It constantly slides around even when not being touched causing web pages to scroll when you don't want them to. It's very annoying. Even setting the mouse to the ""precise"" mode did not correct this problem. I would have returned this mouse if I could've, but I waited too long. Not recommended."
2,Good Mouse - Bad software,"Using OS X and Logitech's driver. The mouse feels comfortable, scrolls easily and I like the wireless aspect. However, the Logitech software (most recent is 2.3.1) is terrible. Lag of 30 seconds or so occurs when ""waking"" the mouse from an automatic shut-down due to inactivity before the computer responds.As an alternative, I reverted to the previous driver 2.2.2. While the lag somewhat disappears, there remains functional problems with the software. My alternative is to use a 3rd party driver such as Steer Mouse or USB Overdrive, which adds to the cost of the product.BTW, Logitech support is abysmal."
3,"Great Mouse, Great features, Wore out too fast!","This mouse is set up beautifully- great features/ buttons, and I cannot survive without the scroll wheel. I thought I had found the ideal mouse. Unfortunately about 1.5 years into owning it the left click has broken and won't reliably click (either doesn't click or double clicks). Needs replacing,a nd far too early for the price paid. If it weren't for the reliability issues, this mouse would get 5 stars for certain."
2,"Sleeps too much, poor surface support, poor range","I bought this mouse to replace my Microsoft Wireless Mouse.While it's a comfortable mouse, it either has transmission problems (wireless), sleep problems(too much battery saving), or doesn't like my desktop (laminate).It will just not respond to movement or buttons until I shake it, or move it to different area.At first I thought it was me, or the desk was too shiny? or something. Now I'm convinced it's the mouse.When I swap in another Logitech wireless mouse, it works fine."
3,Ok...,"Wheel is a bit touchy, I find just moving the mouse around causes the wheel to move and is very frustrating.The software for mac is not very user friendly and does not allow the same assignments as the standard apple mouse."
5,Great Mouse,"Easy to install, simple to configure, has lots of options, and very functional. I like the ability to shut off the mouse, for times when my PC will be inactive for an extended time: this saves battery life. When you set the scroll wheel to 'free-style' instead of the standard 'click' mode, it flys through pages of documents, which can be a great time saver."
3,Mouse,"Good for the money, but not as smooth as the RX revolution... which lasted for about 4 years until the unreplaceable battery took a dump."
5,I'm buying another for my other Mac,"My computer usage (Mac + PC) is pretty typical -- the usual email, web browsing, Visio and other office documents. It's a good mouse because:* It's very COMFORTABLE. Also, it has a ""SOLID QUALITY"" feel to it.* It has excellent BATTERY LIFE.* The CLICK-SCROLL WHEEL between the left and right buttons is very handy. The scroll speed is excellent. Besides being a scroll wheel, in includes DOWN and SIDE-TO-SIDE ""clicks"".* I set up the THUMB BUTTONS for Expose on the Mac.I've never used a better mouse."
4,Nice mouse. Works great,"Ordered two. One didn't turn on out of the box, but returned no hassle. The one I still have works great, no issues - plug and play with both Windows 7 and Windows XP. Comfortable, good battery life."
2,Great mouse but...,"I would have rated 4 or 5 stars except that the biggest drawback of this mouse is the receiver does not store in the bottom of the mouse. I have had this mouse for just under 2 weeks and already lost the receiver. It costs $10 to order a replacement receiver from Logitech + another $6-$11 for shipping. What a waste of money!!! There are many other wireless mice with less features that stow the receiver on the underside. For the $50 price tag, this mouse should have it as well."
1,Logitech MX620 arrived broken and irreparable,"The Logitech MX620 purchased from Tech-for-Less that we received was found to be improperly assembled and irreparable. Obviously, quality control was inadequate at both Logitech and Tech-for-Less.We also had difficulty establishing communications with Tech-for-Less, either by phone or email. Phone messages were ignored and email messages were deleted. Only after emailing Tech-for-Less through techforless@amazon.com was there an immediate and frantic response to remedy the situation to our satisfaction but only after much time and effort on our part.One piece of advice for customers of other vendors through Amazon.com; if you have a problem with the product you receive from a vendor, I suggest you communicate with them through vendor_name@amazon.com if possible. That should get their attention quickly."
1,Don't buy this if you're using a Mac,"One would think that a Mac logo on a box would imply compatibility with a Mac, but Logitech thinks otherwise.Upon plugging in the USB receiver, I realized that I could only point and click. Scroll wheel and the two left side buttons did not function at all. After installing the Logitech Control Center, the software didn't even recognize the mouse. Tried removing the USB receiver and plugging it back in, and the act of just removing the receiver gave me the gray screen of death: My Mac froze and crashed. Uninstalling and resinstalling the software did nothing and trying to remove the receiver again caused my Mac to crash.I've always been a fan of Logitech mice, but this is just horrible. Only being able to point and click with a mouse? I can get more functionality from a ten dollar no-name brand mouse. I had high hopes for this mouse. Logitech: this is absolutely unacceptable."
1,"Works fine, poor package, looks like second-hand item","It works fine, but I have to mention that this one is SELL AS IS but they didn't highlight this point when I bought it. The mouse came with a plastic bag only, no warranty information, no instructions. it just looks like I bought that from some second-hand seller from ebay, which annoyed me because they said it is NEW."
4,Deneuve in 5 wonderful transfers,"FORT SAGANNE is a long, grand epic which must be seen in widescreen. It's really a Gerard Depardieu movieand he is magnificent as a legionnaire in French-occupied Sahara. LE SAUVAGE is a romantic comedy which is one of my favorite Deveuve films. Catherine Deneuve necessarily enters runaway Yves Montand's placid lifeand wreaks havoc. Chemistry again in LE CHOC with Alain Delon as a professional hitman who meets Deneuve when he is hiding out. I had not seen HOTEL DES AMERIQUES before. While I still enjoyed this drama, I could not eventually understand the stubborn fascination of the Deneuve character with Patrick Dewaere (who died tragically young in real life). In MANON 70, Deneuve cannot commit to any one man till she meets Sami Frey, then . . .Here's hoping Lionsgate produces and releases a collection of films starring another French legend -Michele Morgan."
4,"Ah, la belle femme Deneuve","Catherine Deneuve is one of the most beautiful & (given her status) adventurous actresses in the history of cinema (Belle de Jour, Repulsion, La Syrene du Mississippi). While this collection contains some of her more conventional performances, her beauty & her talent cannot be denied. I have an upscaling blu-ray player which renders these movies into better quality than I would have seen at my local cinema in the '70's/80's which will satisfy me until they're released on blu-ray."
3,Good dvds but some bad guitar tabs,"This set comes with 4 dvds but I think the last one is just a interview (not sure though). A bit of the material I am not interested in but most of it is good for practice and something not too hard too start picking up, especially if you want to play song from the band Children of Bodom. One problem is that some of the tabs in the 2nd dvd (not sure about the 3rd dvd) has mistakes in them. This can be a pain because if you car about getting the thing played right you need to look at the dvd of Alexi playing and figure out what you are supposed to play and what is wrong on the tabs. The tabs also come in pdf form so I do not think that you can change them (maybe, but I have not figured out how to do it). This dvd set is probably worth buying if you can get it for less than $40."
2,The description here is wrong,"Despite saying that the SPARS code is DDD, the album is a collection of 78s recorded between 1917 and 1939.And these tracks are not listed: Wedgewood Blue, Sanctuary of the Heart, In A Persian Market, A Dream of Christmas, and In A Monastery Garden.I happen to think that this is second-rate Ketelbey (who is a third-rate composer, IMHO).Ketelbey is an acquired taste .... and I don't mind that I acquired it, but 78s are farther than I intended to go with it. Your mileage may vary.The sound transfers are good."
2,Big Disappointment,"Remember how the Cranberries put out an excellent first album, then decided they had to become ""rockers"" on their subsequent works and it just got worse as time went on? Well, the same thing has happened here.Where the songs on ""Just Another Day"" are distinctive, memorable and play to the strengths of the band, I can't find one song on the harder-edged ""Wire Daisies"" that qualifies.Anyone can put out music this generic and forgettable, but it hurts when a band as talented as WD turn their backs on what makes them special."
4,A great reference but not for the faint of heart,"This work is witty and nearly unassailable, but I can't say that the uninitiated will find it accessible or as wine drinkers may say approachable. If you take pride in careful usage and want to make your writing precise, you can't go wrong here. If you've ever wondered how the words residence and residency both made their way into the language, the answer awaits you within these pages.This isn't the place to get started with learning to write though. For those whose primary endeavor is not writing Strunk and White's Elements of Style or The Practical Stylist by Sheridan Baker will offer much to you on the practice of writing. These titles will also offer you many tips on constructing a piece of writing that you won't find in Fowler.For those interested in a thorough treatment of usage and language you can't go wrong with Fowler though."
5,"Timeless, despite changes in the language","This is a wonderful book, and beats the more recent revision. Fowler goes through all the hard problems of word usage (or at least all the ones that seemed hard when he was writing) and decides them in authoritative fashion. Burchfield's edition might be a more reliable book about the way people use the language now, but it isn't a classic like Fowler's because Fowler is a more interesting companion. His guidance is sharp and demanding, and his sensibility is addictive. This is one of the best of all books for people who love words. As the years go on, it seems to me to be timeless, like Johnson's dictionary is timeless."
3,Not what I expected,I was looking for a book that focused more on which word(s) to use when their meanings are similar but one is more appropriate than the other. It still might be okay. The picture on Amazon is not the book that I received which might be the problem.
3,Editions,"This edition being sold is the second edition published in 1965, the 3rd edition has been out for some time, since 1996."
3,ok,"although the product was as promised, the delivery took several weeks. considering other vendors have shipped within the week - for the same $3.99 shipping charge - I don't feel the service is up to par."
3,Know what you are buying.,"This book is less a book on grammar than it is a dictionary on the usage of particular words. The three stars is meant to be a neutral rating because ""rating"" is a required field to this review form. I did not use the book enough to fairly evaluate it."
3,ORIENTAL WISDOM,"Good, but not comparable to other great Oriental writings, such as Tao Te Ching, The Art of War, and Confucius writings."
4,The Cricket in Times Square takes place in New York.,The cricket used to live in Conneticut and was carried to New York.The cricket is found by a little boy named Mario.The cricket is named Chester Cricket. Chester makes friends with a mouse named Tucker Mouse and Harry Cat. Chester becomes a musician. The book is by George Selden.
3,"dull, dull,dull...","The Cricket in the Times Square is an educational book, I have to admit. It taught people many lessons. BUT, this book has so many complicated words and its content is just plain dull. And it's weird how this author describes a Chinese man and some Chinese cultures. When I read this book, I felt as if I might fall asleep any minutes."
4,A Janie-come-lately to this classic,"The source of this thin volume is not noted on the inside front cover as many of my books are, especially ""fleas."" I imagine it is because it was in nearly-new condition and I didn't want to deface it. In the run-up to Christmas, I read it to see if it would be appropriate for a 10-year-old, 5th grade granddaughter. I think it will. Even if a parent has to sit with her as she reads aloud.I thought talking-animal stories were ""out"" but that stricture must have been added since 1960.Being from the country's heartland, I enjoyed the New York scenes and had no problem with Sai Fong and the Chinese dialect. In fact, I can see children laughing delightedly as they read (or hear) the oddly-spelled words.I chuckled several times during the hour-and-a-half.No reviewer I read commented on Garth Williams' wonderful detailed drawings, which added another dimension to the experience.I wonder if my children (all grown) had read this? Not under my roof--for some sad reason."
5,the cricket in times square (a good book for bug lovers),This book is great. This book is about a boy named Mario Bellini who finds a cricket named chester. The bellinis own a newspaperstand in Times Square. They don't have much money. Will this cricket be helpful to them? Read the cricket in times square to find out.
3,Emily's Review of The Cricket in Times Square,"I really liked The Cricket in Times Square because there are lots of funny and unusual characters! It is about a small boy named Mario who finds a very unusual pet - a cricket! The cricket, Chester, ends up takinga subway to New York, and meets two other friends, Tucker Mouse and Harry Cat.This was a hilarious book as Chester tries to manage in the city,which is unlike his Conneticut home.This book is realistic fiction which means that everything in the book didn&#65533;t happen, but it could happen. The author created many interesting characters at very unsual times. I like the way George Selden made the characters come to life. He described every character, so that I could visualize them in my mind, even without the pictures.I would recommend this book to people who like adventure stories.Younger kids,and most adults would like The Cricket in Times Square."
3,A great and funny book to read.,"I like ""The Cricket in Times Square"" because I especially enjoy books with animals and that's what it was. It involved music which I love very much. I also like the book because it always had action. TRD."
5,Very pleased with condition of used books!,"I purchased 5 of these for a lit class I am doing with 3-6 grade. I was extremelly pleased with the condition of the books. No markings, very little wear. Would definitely purchase similar items."
5,A cozy story!,"This book gives you a warm feeling inside as you settle down to read this tale. It is a good rainy day book. The ending is somewhat, well different, but it doesn't leave you sad or hanging. I would recommend this book to other thirteen-year-olds. It is not way to easy, or overly difficult to read. I would actually reccomend it to ages 11-14. All in all it is a good beginning book for a series of entertainment."
5,"Ah, The Memories","This is one of those wonderful books I read as a child that brings back such nostalgic memories for me. I barely remember the whole story anymore but that doesn't matter. Its the warm feeling I get when I think how much I loved it back then and couldn't put it down at the time. Certain scenes stick out in my mind like it was yesterday and give me much joy when I think of them. As with any classic childrens' book the pictures are as important as the story and pulling that duty here is Garth Williams, illustrator of two of my all time favorite books growing up, Stuart Little and Charlotte's Web. I highly recommend The Cricket In Times Square to any child who wants to create memories for a lifetime."
4,The Cricket in Times Square was a great book.,"It's about a cricket who's from Connecticut, and somehow ends up in New York under a stack of newspapers in an unsuccesful newsstand. A boy named Mario finds Chester [he's the cricket] and makes him a home out of a matchbox. Chester meets 2 great friends named Tucker mouse and Harry cat. One day Chester finds out he's a talented singer.He attracts everybody in the subway station to the stand which helps Mario, Mama, and Papa Bellini. One time after one of Chester's concerts he said to Tucker and Harry that he was unhappy because he only likes to chirp when he is happy.So he hops on a subway train that takes him back to Connecticut."
5,"The book didn't ""bug"" ME!","The Cricket in Times Square was a book that I enjoyed very much. Even though I'm only 7, I had a fun time reading it in my second grade class. My favorite character was Tucker Mouse. I do a lot of scurrying myself. But I didn't like the last part when Chester went back to Connecticut. Right now I'm reading Chester Cricket Finds a New Home. I'm enjoying that, too. I recommend the Chester Cricket series to kids of all ages."
4,I liked this book because it was interesting and exciting!,"This book was about a cricket named Chester, who used to live in Connecticut, but was brought to New York City in someone's picnic basket. A boy named Mario found him and took good care of him. When Mario found out that Chester had a talent in chirping, everyone in New York City knew about him. Business became good for Mario and his parents, but Chester wasn't happy. He didn't like to be looked at and he didn't get to be with Mario. In this book, you never knew what was going to happen next. I liked it because it had animals as characters. What I didn't like about it was that the book didn't have jokes."
4,SUBWAY SYMPHONIES,"Can a country cricket from Connecticut make a successful career change in New York's Times Square? Can he make friends and influence people among the callous commuters? Can he find musical fulfillment in a noisy subway station? Well, Chester is an excellent musician (who regretfully acquires a guilded, oriental cage) but how can he be heard in his new environment?Honest and grateful as well as talented, Chester wants to help his hosts--the Bellini family--at their struggling newspaper stand. But will his noble ideals be tainted by metropolitan animal riffraff? He is bombarded by contrasting values: greed and compassion. Most of all, how can he reach an understanding about his personal freedom, without hurting the feelings of the gentle boy who cares for him? Or will they both be exploited on some TV talk show? A cute story which will amuse the reader."
1,Racist Book,"This book portrays very old racist stereotypes of Chinese people. It portrays Chinese people as speaking in stereotypical accents with all r's replaced by l's. It portrays Chinese people as not knowing when to stop bowing to each other. It portrays Chinese people wearing Japanese Kimono's. If you MUST buy this awful ignorant book, do not let your child read it without teaching them about the racism and teaching them how not to be as ignorant."
2,I thought is wasn't good.,"This is about a boy and a cricket. Mario, the boy, is working at a newsstand when he hears a noise. He looks under a trash can and finds a cricket. He buys a cage for the cricket, and that's how it turns out. The part I liked is when the cricket chirps and asks the man who was going to steal the bell what he was doing. I did not like the rest."
4,Charming book,I preview all of the books I assign to my kids to read. I enjoyed this one. Vivid descriptions allowed me to vividly imagine the scene and hear the music the cricket plays. This is a book I will have my 11 and 13 year-old read.
5,Childrens Classic,"This is my favorite childrens book, I love the story and the wonderful Times Square setting. The drawings by Garth Williams are some of the best of the genre. The innocence of the period is heartwarming and the characters are unforgetable. I can remember the excitement I had reading this book as a child, I could not wait to get home from school to read more, when I think of this book I always smile and return to my youth and it lifts me up. It is always the first childrens book I recommend it is that special."
5,The Cricket In Times Square,"The Cricket In Times Square is one of the most exciting books I have everread. This book is about three friends,Chester ,a cricket,Tucker a mouse,and Harry, a cat. Chester Cricket is from Connecticut, but in the bookhe ends up in New York. How does this happen? Find out by reading thebook. If you love miracles and music you will certainly love this book."
5,"Classic, beautiful children's tale","Last night, I finished Chapter 15 of ""The Cricket in Times Square"" with my 7-year-old daughter. I originally read this book in the early 70's and had wonderful memories of a beautiful story of a cricket, mouse, and cat, who change the lives of a hard-working family who owns a newspaper stand in the subway station of Times Square. This second reading was all the more special when shared with a child who couldn't wait for the next night and the next chapter of this heartwarming story."
3,Okay book,I like this book because it has a cricket and it gives a lot of detail in its description of places and characters. One reason I didn't like the book was that the cricket got blamed for everything and it's not fair. I give this book 3 stars.
2,No outfit complete w/o dog hair,"This pillow is smaller than I expected and is almost over stuffed. I returned it because the final stitching to close up the hole where the stuffing was inserted was very crooked and went up into the body of the pillow. It cased the whole thing to be misshappen. If you do have dog hair around the house, it will surely attach itself to the backside of this pillow since it's black. Cute sentiment, quality control needs improving."
3,The UP Trail.,The overall story was interesting and kept me reading but the continued troubles of the heroine brought to mind the perils of Pauline.
4,U.P.Trail review,Zane Grey is an excellent writer but this one was a little too wordy.Some of the hardships endured by the builders were unimaginable.
5,Hell's Angels History Channel.,Great documentary. Great story of the Hell's Angels. Complete and good item for anybody like the story about this motorcycle club. A+A+A+A+A+.
3,Hell Bound,"This was a pretty good overview of the club, but of course only scratches the surfaces of the worlds most powerful outlaw biker gang. More footage of the gang in action in Nevada would of been nice as they stood thier ground and went toe to toe with the Mongols."
2,Entertaining but mostly a re-hash of information available elsewhere.,"The best part of this DVD is Sonny Barger telling the clubs history from his point of view. Had the whole DVD been based on Sonny and his version of history and then it would have been worth it.The rest of it is middle class reportage of a rehash of what Hunter Thompson wrote and Yves Lavigne re-reported in their books.The vintage photos seem to have been lifted from said books.The videos of Altamont, restaurant and street scenes were interesting though."
3,"It's just ""okay""","I'm becoming more and more disappointed with ""THC"" documentaries. Either I'm looking for documentaries to be more in-depth, or they becoming more and more shallow in thier coverage. This episode was probably more for people who have only ""just heard of"" the HAs. A previous reviewer was correct that most of the ""action"" video clips are really just clips from movies. Disappointing.As a review of Amazon.com, the product arrived quickly and in good condition."
2,Read a book instead!!!,"I am like most, rather watch a movie about a subject than read. However, I read ""Hell's Angel: The Life and Times of Sonny Barger and the Hell's Angels Motorcycle Club,"" by Sonny himself and found that there was a lot more information on the 81's that could/should have been in the episode especially since the history channel has almost 60 years worth of information regarding the ""Red and White!""I was disappointed!!!"
2,"""Needed More History""","How it all came to be and where it is now would have given a better insight into the club. The history of this club should have been the main idea for this DVD.... It was okay, could have been better."
1,AntiVirus 2004 Pro not worth the hassle,"I have to agree with the majority of the reviews so far. I bought Pro to install on two Win XP computers. On one, it runs mostly fine (though Windows Explorer crawls occasionally, and there are problems scanning some long downloads). But on the other, I can't get LiveUpdate to work at all (even after using 'Intelligent' Updater), despite following every single piece of advice on the technical support web site - and I suspect that paying for phone support would be similarly futile.This feels like a piece of software which hasn't been tested to a useful level - get a fix out asap, Symantec, or you'll continue to deserve to lose customers! AV software needs to be rock solid, and this is far from it."
1,Basic NAV plus file protection = pro edition,"I gave this four stars but now I'm downgrading it to one star (or no star if that had been available), because it made my system (WinXP Home on P4-2.4Ghz and 512MB of RAM) very slow, and the ""live update"" auto-updating feature did not work for months. This is a terrible program. Everything negative people said about Norton/Symantec products, which I used to like, turned out to be true in the case. Stay away, please."
1,Don't buy it - check revierws before buying Norton stuff,"Have been a satisfied user of Norton Systemworks, Antivirus, Cleansweep etc for many years - this program has completely undermined my confidence in this company.The product activation did not come up with a valid number so I never got around to activating the program.Too many problems - will carefully check product reviews before buying Norton stuff in the future and probably just get an alternative.Norton should offer a full refund, or a free upgrade to an antivirus program that actually works, to anyone who bought this program."
1,I want my Norton 2003 Back,"I recently upgraded to Norton 2004 Professional. It is so slow I am considering uninstalling the program. My Norton 2003 was great and did not slow down my computer at all. Unfortunately 2004 is DOG. My advice is to buy an old 2003 Norton. Of the 3 computers I own, it runs alright on one, a new dell. My 6 month old dell and my 1 year old laptop can't seem to run the progam very well. My laptop used to boot in 30-40 seconds and now takes 3-5 minutes. I find it hard to believe they put out such poor product."
1,Caution! Subscription wipeout!,"Do not upgrade to a new version of Norton AV if you have time left on your existing subscription! Your subscription does not carry over to the new version! Please talk this up, as I've heard tons of people getting burned by this!"
1,Do you want a sluggish computer ? use NAV2004,"I've always been using NortonAV, 'till now that is !After installing my computer slowed down in such a waythat with every move i make i have to wait for about 30 seconds.Even opening my start menu.....It scans every single byte that goes into memory !!What is this for stupidity ?If i want my data on my harddisk scanned i'll do it myself.Just scan my incoming data !!!They obviously are not thinking at Norton, or they are thinking too much.Why scan old files which are scanned before and didn't change afterwords...Because every year they need to make new software in order toget more money out of your pocket and then it should do something new. like scanning data over and over again evenif the program already knows that the files are not infected..."
5,"Never Had a Problem, Never Had a Virus","I have been running Norton Anti-virus products since 2000, and never had a problem. It has kept me virus free that whole time, and caught quite a few nasty ones as well. I have had it installed on Windows 98, ME, and XP. It is intuitive, and I like the auto-update feature. (...)"
1,This is one SLOW dog!,"Don't waste your money on this. NAV and NPF have always been quite slow, but at least up to 2003 they were tolerable. The 2004 version is slooooooow. For several minutes after I log in it does not let me launch ANY applications until it finishes launching its zilions of services. When I try to launch anyting it comes up with the message ""Application is waiting for a virus scan"". I plan to take advantage of Symatec's money back guarantee and return this DOG to the. Ugh! Guess I will have to try MacAfee+ZoneAlarm this year."
1,Major problem with product activation,"I've been using Norton Antivirus for several years. It's been pretty solid, maybe a bit slow. I thought an upgrade to the latest version would be routine. How wrong I was! The product activation has a bug on Windows XP Professional that makes it ""forget"" that it's been activated. And after you activate a few times, it locks out your product key leaving your computer completely unprotected. The Symantec knowledge base acknowledges the problem but cheerfully tells you they don't know how to fix it. Testing? What testing? I think it's time to get my money back and buy a product that actually works."
1,It's Terrible,"Installed Norton Antivirus 2004 Pro on 5 workstations and activated them successfully. 3 of the workstations kept bringing up a warning about configuration not being completed by administrator when a user logged in. 2 workstations didn't have this warning, but web surfing on those workstations became painfully slow. Norton on all workstations was setup exactly the same way.There is no free tech support for installation. Symantec puts out a buggy program and expects the user to pay just to talk to them. So you'll pay $40 to buy the software and $25 to talk to them and maybe get your problem resolved. Anyway, 2004 pro is terrible in my opinion. Besides that Symantec wants to charge for installation tech support.If you need antivirus for your home computers use AVG from grisoft.com. I use this on all 3 of my home computers and have never had a software conflict with any program including games."
1,"Taking back what I said before, this truly sucks","When NAV 2004 first came out I gave it four stars, but I now rescind that positive review completely. The program has been a total resource hog in the last two months and, to my great dismay last week, it actually missed catching a virus! The culprit was the ""auto update"" thing which hadn't worked for a long time! This is the worst piece of software I've come across. I downloaded a free version of Panda Anti-Virus last week and it was able to catch and clean the virus without a hitch.NAV sucks and I'll never buy another product from Symantec again."
4,Good Quality Snips,"I own a few of Bahco's products and I have been very satisfied with the consistent quality. At first glance these snips don't look like much, but the quality of materials is great for the price. They are very comfortable to use with the spring having the perfect amount of tension. The safety latch is user friendly with a hole located just below to attach a lanyard. The only complaint is after a few months of use rust was present on the sharpened edges, but that, I guess, is to be expected and easily taken care of."
4,Good independent thriller,"I thought this was an excellent short(er) film about demons, both within and without. Although at times the camerawork was obviously second-rate, the overall feel of the film was very good. The writers did an excellent job of adding the possession element without it overcoming the movie. Very, very well written. This made up for some of the shortcomings of the film.The action starts with the very first scene of the guy being hunted inside a parking garage, and doesn't let up until the climax at the end. Michael Eklund did a marvelous acting portrayal of a nervous and withdrawn drug dealer. At times, he really carried the movie.I would recommend this movie if you enjoy high intensity thrillers (think Momento with a sprinkle of demons.)"
2,"Ok, nowhere near Great.","I'm posting my opinion on this movie, and I did not care much for this at all. I will note that it is worth renting. I thought the intensity level was excellent, but it climaxed and ended to suddently. There are just way to many things that are left up to the viewer's imagination, and In my opinion that's what spoiled it for me. I respect the approach in taking horror and Demon's in a more thought provoking conservative direction, but it just didn't work for me.Nothing can and ever will top The Exorcist in horror!If you buy this get it used $4 or less!Happy Viewing"
2,Not enough accurate content.,"I bought this book today because I'm an avid Ty collector. There are so many Beanies not listed, and hardly any of the various other types of Ty products. Also only a few pages of each of the other brands of plush when I know there are so many products. This is just not a very complete book. If you want a much better, although still not perfect Ty collector guide, go to Bangzoom Press and buy the Beanie Babies Value Tracker from them."
2,Warmans bean plush field guide,"The item was too old for today's prices and that may be my fault for not researching enough. But still, how can you sell something 5 years old at current prices?"
5,great purchase,Love the book. Everything you wanted to know about TY beanie babies. Invaluable purchase - book is in excellent shape. Thank you.
5,The basic starting point for studying linguistics of ASL,"Title says it all. This is THE book. The book is very instructive for anyone interested in linguistics, as every issue in linguistics is covered (but via an analysis of a visual, multi-dimensional language). Many insights can be gained from this book, no question."
2,awsome .....for the 1st 100 pages then well........,as the title says i cant express how bad it gets.
5,"Instant ""classic""","A great CD for the whole family. Joseph, A nashville tribute... covers his life from the Sacred Grove to Carthage and the people who influenced and/or were influenced by the Prophet. Produced by the talented Jason Deere (producer of SHeDAISY) and Dan Truman (of Diamond Rio fame), this powerful collection of songs includes a wide variety of styles; from the lively ""Rising,"" about events following the first vision to touching songs like ""Emma (How much can one heart take)"" or ""Brother I'll follow you"" about Joseph and Hyrum's relationship.Beautiful arrangements, talented singers, powerful testimonies - you'll even enjoy finding out about some of the more colorful characters in Joseph's life (like Porter Rockwell).Pick this one up, you'll be glad you did."
5,Very nice,"I have listened to this CD over and over. It's like listening to a nice theatrical version of a tribute to the prophet Joseph Smith. It's uplifting and really touches the heart.I didn't like Trek very much, but I think that's because I don't have any mormon pioneers in my family (I AM the pioneer -- I'm the first one to join the church.)I highly recommend this CD. In fact, I bought several to give as Christmas gifts this year."
1,How Do You Mess Up a UV Filter?,"I have purchase Sunpak products before and know they are not Tiffen, but for a simple UV filter I didn't see how it could be bad. However, the product I received had the glass filter too small for the metal ring. Perhaps the factory accidentally put a 72mm filter in a 77mm casing, but I sent it back for a refund.I recommend either Tiffen or Hoya. Or this one if you are in no rush."
5,A very readable introduction to holistic health care,"My mother gave me this book as a gift soon after it was published in 1993 and it continues to be relevant and useful, and fascinating. Dr. Andrew Weil provides an insightful introduction, and the list of respected contributors adds to the ongoing effectiveness of this guide."
4,Cool Funk,"I throughly enjoy this album. It has memorable themes. I especially enjoyed the the samba song ""Baja Bossa"". It opens with some classically approached guitar playing and then picks up speed. The title song is also very good. Oliver's use of different textures is wonderful. Enjoy."
4,Strong & sturdy despite small crack,The crack was on the back of the table lip and can not be seen as it is against the wall. It is a nice space for sewing or other needs and extremely sturdy and strong.
2,Sewing machine table,"This table jumps when I sew a fast stitch on my sewing machine while it is on this table. So much so that when I sew on the machine on the table, my scissors and pins will bounce right off the table onto the floor. I sew a lot and needed a table for my new machine. It was actually so difficult to see what I was sewing when the table was jumping that I finally switched it with my serger machine that I don't use much and juts use it as a flat surface table as the opening is not big enough for the serger.Also, when I had my straight stitch machine on the table and dropped it down to sew level with the table my knees would hit the dropped part when I sat up to the table to sew. It is difficult to change from a dropped position to a level position fast. You have to completely remove the machines cords and I also removed the machine to make sure it didn't fall.I would not recommend this to anyone wanting to use it for a sewing machine."
2,Misleading,"The product detail leads you to believe you are getting three booklets, when you are only getting one. The other two are just one page instructions folded to look like a booklet. The main booklet is not like the original and is written in five or so languages surrounding the picture making both the instructions (in your language) harder to read and detail in the illustration harder to see. Go for the original Jon Gnagy Learn To Draw."
3,Hopefully not his best,"I decided to read Anthony Trollop's ""Cousin Henry"" after reading the two available reviews. Although I enjoy nineteenth century British fiction, I have to confess I've never read anything by Trollop. The situation is a common one in this genre: Henry is supposed to inherit his uncle's property through entitlement, not because he is loved, admired or respected. Quite the contrary - he is none of those things and this makes up the bulk of the novel. Will Henry live up to, or overcome, his despicable character? While it is well-written, the author does tend to go over Henry's internal conflict again and again and again. Hopefully it's not his best; I look forward to trying something else by him."
5,WHEN ARE THERE GOING TO BE MORE BOOKS FROM ME?,I K.D TOWNSENDWANT TO THANK EVERYONE WHO HAS BOUGHT MY BOOK.I WANT YOU TO KNOW WHY I HAVEN'T WRITTEN A BOOK IN AWHILE.THE GOVERMENT HAS SEIZED MY BOOKS AND HAVE USED THEM AGAINST ME.I HAVENT SINCE THEN FELT THE DESIRE TOO WRITE FOR A LONG TIME.I NOW HAVE BROKEN DOWN MY WALL OF SILENCE. AND HAVE STARTED ON MY NEXT BOOK ABOUT THE FEDERAL GOVERMENT AND MYSELF.I HOPE WHEN THE BOOK COMES OUT YOU WILL READ IT.IN THE MEAN TIME ENJOY MY OTHER BOOKS.ONCE AGAINTHANK-YOUK.D TOWNSENDAUTHOR
4,A Belgium opinion ....,"When I read those reviews this must be a very special book about a very special person... The story of Caroline ... a story worth to know .. The world of Caroline ... a world worth to explore Caroline ... a person worth to be acquainted with ... "" He calls me Caroline "" ... a book worth to read. I rate this book ""only"" 4 stars ... I keep the fifth in reserve to award after my reading ."
3,Nice little family movie,"Fun little kids movie that brought back memories of the original book, which I haven't read in 35 years. Nothing special about the movie, and it can't compare to the great Pixar films, but well enough done that I didn't turn it off."
4,Better than I expected,"I truly didn't expect this movie to be so great. I bought it simply for the kids, but it's a funny and almost educational film. It has not-so-subtle religious themes which give parent a chance to talk about various topics of religion, like if God exists, faith, forgiveness, etc. We've watched this at least a half-dozen times already in three days and it's still good. It's one of those kid films you can listen to as parents and not really get annoyed with. Great movie...much better than I expected. I gave it 4 stars because there's a scene that involves the genitals (typical ""guy gets hit in the you-know-whats"") that I think could have been left out."
3,Horton,"Inexpensive enough but the movie is only so good. If you're in to owning a bunch of movies, then adding this isn't a bad option but if you only want top movies, then this one didn't fit that bill for me."
5,Great Movie!,"I purchased this movie because my kids ages 1, 3,5 and 7 really loved watching Horton on a rented DVD. They kept asking after we sent it back! Jim Carey does a great job! I would recommend this movie!"
4,Horton Hears a Who! So should you,"This is a great kid's movie and their parents will enjoy watching it with them.This movie will engage your child's imagination of the smallest things in the universe in a playful and compassionate way. It is full of nice value statements about compassion, trust, power, jealousy, loyalty, and frivality.It is a fun, feel-good movie that will be watched again and again."
3,Eh,"It was better than I thought it was going to be, but it's still a bastardization of a classic children's book."
2,okay,this movie was okay i think they shot it towards 1-8 year olds who would think its funny im 11 it okay
2,not very exciting,"I did not find this film very captivating, infact I fell asleep in the middle. I think a child would find it a bit slow moving."
3,Horton Hears a Who,Great price and fast service. Product condition not as good as desribed but still watchable. A really good movie for chilren. I would recommed it.

1,Poor Quality,This is a movie from a store like coborns that was rented out. I don't feel like this should be something that you should be able to sell on amazon.
3,1,movies ok feels like there could have been more put into it like they did with the Lorax. but still like it
4,Can't go wrong with Dr. Suess,"I have two boys and they both really like this movie! They both at ages 4 and 12, love Dr. Suess books, and this movie was a perfect gift for them!"
5,Horton DVD,"My kids claim that they have seen this movie in school, but they have watched it 2 times already since they opened it up just 3 days ago...I would say it's great! :)"
5,"Horton Hears A Who, Granddaughter loved it.","My granddaughter is three years old and loves it.Her mother had to read her the book every night for a week. She saw the movie in the theater with her mom and dad,she was quiet for the hold movie.She loved it."
5,great price on dvd,"bought this movie for my daughter to put into her collection for my future grandchildren. hear it is a great movie, have not seem it myself"
5,pleased,I received my order in record time--in good condtionThanks for the prompt service! I enjoy using Amazon and suggest to my friends that they do the same
4,Horton hears a who,Good story line and simple plot added enjoyment to the truth in this lovely adaptation of the Dr. Seuss book of the same title. My grandson loved the action and the characters and stayed envolved with the movie only loosing interest a few times. And I also enjoyed the story enough to have watched this several times now with my grandson.
2,Ho hum,"My 3 year old granddaughter likes this one, but I try to coax her toward something else when she comes to my house. We have a lot of better movies."
4,The Grandkids love it.,Just a great family movie. The Grand Kids watch it over and over. I've seen it once too often I guess.
3,My kids were bored,"Though they loved another Dr. Seuss movie (The Lorax), my kids (girl 2 & boy 6) were not so into this one. It was kind of slow. Animation is great though."
3,too noisy and self referential,way over the head of my 5 year old. disappointed with the pacing which went way too fast and the film wasn't clever or fun. would not recommend.
5,great great,THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE AT A GREAT PRICE IM VERY HAPPY SO WILL MY SON BE AT CHRISTMAS WHEN HE SEES HIS GIFT
5,good movie,cant belive i havent watched it sooner better than the new lorax movie great on blu ray worth watching! worth the money!
1,Where is it???????????,I have yet to receive this movie and I ordered it quite some time ago. I did however get my cd's but not my son's movie for christmas.
5,Great Movie to show off your Blu Ray Player & HDTV!!!,"This is a great movie (picture wise) to show off that LCD or Plasma HDTV!!The story of the actual movie is great as well as it will make you think about the bigger picture in life!The cast of characters are pretty funny as well!Overall just a fun movie, and worth it just for the quality!!"
5,Horton Hears a Who...great entertainment...that's true!,"In March in the year of 2008came a movie that was oh so great!It was Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a WhoQuite the delight at the box office..so true!The voices of Jim Carey,Carol Burnett and Steve Carrellmake this 3-D animated picture go oh so swell!This is a movie that is worth seeing once or twiceEven more, and that would be really nice!So my advice for DVD fans just like youIt's go out and buy,""HORTON HEARS A WHO""!!"
4,Dr Seuss 's tale takes a life of its own,"The right people and the right mood can create some of the best projects.I guess they had all the right ingredients making this movie. All do agreat job in giving life to the characters, and a big Kudo to Jim Carreyfor his energy in giving Horton life.Good for the kids, enjoyed it a lot as a adult.A Keeper, good for multiple views."
3,It's Okay,"I bought this for my son for Christmas (from Santa), and it came in great condition. Not a huge fan of the movie after seeing it--it doesn't hold my attention very well. It's okay for $4, though."
4,Good adaptation,"This story is a classic Dr Seuss and it is very well done (a notch higher than the Thorax). Carrey does an outstanding job, along with the rest of the voice cast. I highly recommend this to families with younger children, but it is well enough done that it satisfies the kid in all of us adults."
5,Best Remake from Classic!,"This was a favorite of mine as a child, now my children love it as well, This is a must have! Enjoy it! This movie looks amazing on Blu Ray, Wow!"
3,Special ed. misleading!,"Am I the only one who was suckered by the 2-disc special ed.? Since Amazonno longer gives any details about the contents of each disc, we're prettymuch in the dark about what we're getting. I assumed there would be special features on the 2nd disc, not that it would be the digital copy only. Many titles are marketed with digital copies but this isthe first one I've seen that's been so misleading. So I paid extra for a 2nd disc which I won't use. Buyer beware!"
5,Perfect for all,"We went to see origionally at theater. I have always loved HORTON! This movie is great, good for the kids. My son loves it as well!If you love Jim Carry as the Grinch, you'll love him as Horton!10+"
4,Horton Hears a Who,Horton Hears a who wasn't exactly what I thought it would be from the start but I wound up enjoying it. It is a childrens movie but has some interest for an adult; especially if you like a happy ending with only moderate suspense.
5,Cute,My son hasn't watched this yet but decided to get it for him for Christmas since we go on long trips and drives. Seems like it will be cute and Amazon had an amazing price on it during the holidays.
5,Hilarious,I know I'm a grown woman but this movie is just hilarious to me! Crack up every time I watch it.
5,The best!!!!,"It's my favorite move, even as a college student! I love how funny and lighthearted it is, plus the whole thing rhymes! What could be better??"
5,a great movie,"these was great movie becz Jim carrey voiced horton and horton seemed so real adults and children will love these movie, its a great movie for families as well"
2,"Great for kids, NOT adults!","I just got done watching this minutes ago, and wow, was it ever a struggle to get through. I was hoping for something along the lines of""Madagascar"" which, while on the silly side, had enough adult humor and some sense of SENSE. ""Horton"" is an absolute mess of non-stop jabber, stupid dialog, and humor only a child could appreciate. There are a few funny lines but they are lost amid a swarm of rambling, pointless dialog (which is over-voiced by everyone except Carrell) and dizzying colors and shapes horrifyingly reminiscent of ""A Bee Story"". It's a wonderful movie for kids with a short attention span but if you're over the age of 11, you'll be squirming in your chair counting the minutes until it's over. I was very disappointed in what could have been a good ""for everyone"" film."
1,couldnt download to my android tablet,bought for my daughter to watch on her tablet and coundnt get it to download to her tablet waste of my money
1,Horton Hears a Who Audio Storybook CD gift set,Horton Hears a Who! (Amazon.com Exclusive DVD Gift Set with Plush and Audio Storybook CD + Digital Copy)This gift set did not include the audio storybook cd and is false advertising. I am very disappointed with this purchase and will not be using amazon again. Walmart is cheaper and you can actually see what you are purchasing rather than relying on a false description.
1,also disappointed,"As with the disappointment shown by other customer's submissions, I too ordered this ""Horton Hears a Who"" set when there were no reviews to consult. The fact that the set claims to have an audio CD is a fallacy, and the CD and the plush toy were the selling points. The enclosed plush toy hardly qualifies as a plush toy but at least it's here. The CD is not included and that is false advertising on Amazon's behalf. I too am moderately disappointed with this set because I did not get what I paid for."
1,Horton Hears a Who! [Blu-ray] (Purchased on 02/17/2009),Horton Hears a Who! [Blu-ray] (Purchased on 02/17/2009)This itme was described to have bothdigital and Blue-Ray formatted discs. I have three (3) DVD Players?recorders and none of the thtee (3 would play the disc in the Digital format. Very disappointed with the produce.Simon Pentz
5,colgate herbal,"I used a colgate herbal I bought in Russia that contained eucalyptus,myrrh,chamonile,sage. Not sure if the one reviewed is the same product. Have not been able to find in US."
4,Works great,I admit I should have gotten a bigger size but I made it work. Works well with my pond and easy to conceal
2,Game of Death,"Although the packaging shows Game of Death, the DVD itself is Game of Death II. The set doesn't include the first one so if you over this set, be sure to verify you got what you ordered. Not impressed Amazon."
4,scholar,"This is a used book, which was bought from Amazon marketplace. I received the book after 3 days. I am satisfied for buying this item."
3,Wish there were more pages in these books,"Love seeking games for my girls, but I sure wish there was more pages and more to be found in these books..."
5,I Spy,We do a unit on poetry at school and never have enough of these books for our use so I decided to order them on here and found tons for the right price.
3,Photo incorrect. Beware,The 926 adapter cable is reversed from the photo description. The two pin was a female configuration while the house connector was a male configure when received. I will be ordering the Humminbird 629 adapter cable for my application. I need to adapt the older transducer to the new 650 model in dash gauge.
4,Best of what's available,"Despite some fairly serious errors and omissions, this book is the best academic treatment of the field of herpetology yet written. It is a multi-authored text which allows people to write on what they know best, rather than making authors stretch well beyond their fields of expertise. This unfortunately means there's a lot of repetition between chapters, and some flat-out contradictions. It does a fairly good of reviewing the literature in a number of sub-fields of herpetology, and so provides more up-to-date reviews than you're likely to find in ""Biology of the Reptilia"". It is a good choice for a herpetology course for undergraduates--in fact I plan to use it for such a course in summer 1999. Amazing omissions: dinosaurs!! birds!! biogeography!! Notable inclusions: good chapters on foraging ecology, classification (too short), & thermoregulation."
5,EXCELLENT!,"Glaser's latest book is full of wit and wisdom. He's a king of craft, and his subtle language play is sure to please poets (who can learn from him) and non-poets alike."
4,Typical Harlequin Superromance - fast and fun!,"If you're looking for deep thoughts that will teach you something about life, obviously you're looking in the wrong section of Amazon books! I like to read these books after a long day of working with folks who have truly serious, disastrous events/emotions with which they're struggling. Brenda Novak created the town of Dundee and then wrote truly fascinating stories of each character. Of course they fall in love, experience some entanglement with outside forces that drive them apart, and then have a happily ever after ending, and this is totally satisfying for the reader! I have bought all the Dundee books, and enjoy Ms Novak's storytelling."
3,good book,it was very good story and very fast reading great for plane reading and waiting for plane connecetion when transfering
4,"The not so ""Good Old Days""","The most striking features of this little dark gem of a film that make it emminently watchable are the beautifully composed black and white shots, often rendered through unusual angles, and the simply elegant soundtrack composed of classical tracks mixed in with modern classical/folk. I found myself being pulled back in time as the film unravelled its stories and slowly steamrolled me over by the sheer volume of misery experienced by the northern immigrant communities. It makes one wonder how much of the small town, everyday life variety of American history is glossed over and forgotten about. Sadly, I think you could have made this film about any number of areas of the US and the human experience between 1850 and 1950 and you would find similar tales of suffering, strife and moral collapse. This should be required watching for those who still believe that there ever was a such thing as the American dream."
4,Macabre journey into Wisconsin's bizarre history...,"Wisconsin Death Trip is a journey back to the late 19th century into the town of Black River Falls, Wisconsin, where poverty, hunger, and a grueling winter are assaulting the inhabitants. The population of the small town is mostly of immigrants from Norway and Germany and they are suffering to the point of madness where murder and bizarre behavior results from their anguish. This anguish is often blamed upon witchcraft, ghosts, and other evils as it brings many to the Mendota Asylum for the Insane. As the film unfolds it becomes an expedition through Wisconsin and the many macabre incidences that took place between 1890 and 1900. In the end, it offers some interesting insight to the state of Wisconsin and it offers a truly grisly, yet well done, cinematic experience."
1,Description VERY Misleading,"This is NOT a story about Black River Falls, as the description indicates. It is a film about stories from around Wisconsin as reported in a paper from Black River Falls, with some hokey footage of modern (1990's) day Black River Falls.There are very few photographs from the period and the film footage is mostly an attempt at what I can only call ""modern art"". Cut out about 20 minutes of ""filler"" and this would be a somewhat better film.Basically, it's a collection of ""strange but true stories"" that have no connection to each other, except they took place around the same period of time and took place somewhere in the state of Wisconsin. And the modern footage makes no positive contribution at all. In fact, if I was from Black River Falls, I would be upset about how the town is portrayed.A complete waste of time and film."
3,FAUX DOCUMENTARY OF CREEPY EVENTS,"Inspired by Michael Lesy's eerie cult-fave book from the 70s, WISCONSIN DEATH TRIP (Home Vision Entertainment) is a documentary drama that recreates the real economic, spiritual and physical collapse of the mostly German and Norwegian immigrants of Black River Falls, Wisconsin, in the 1890s.After a hard winter and a devastating dyptheria epidemic, there was an outbreak of madness, murder, mayhem, arson, possession, ghosts and suicide. The atmospheric recreations are interspersed with archival photos and newspaper clippings that are not without an element of black humor. Great eclectic music track."
1,"Photos of dead people, sad and disrespectful....","I thought that this ""documentary"" sounded great. It's not. Private photos of children's dead bodies, poorly reenacted suicides, and a dry narrator reading old healdlines, made this awful for me. Very broad definiations of insanity, alcholism, and no antibodics is the story here. Which could have been spun in a good but still interesting way, like look how far we've come, instead of taking a small town's troubles and trying to make an X-file like documentery. Bad...."
1,"Not much new thought, rambling","This book is a rambling collection of opinion and assumed facts. It is very poorly edited (one chapter ends in mid-sentence) and there are way too many subheadings and bold extracted quotes that give the book more of a tabloid feel (and expands the number of pages -- maybe there wasn't enough material??). A lot of the ""You should know"" sidebars are statements of opinion dressed up as fact. There are some interesting factual tidbits, but it is almost too much effort to wade through the chaff to find them."
4,The soapbox,"It is the kind of book you read slowly because you don't want Ranum's points to end.Ranum takes command of the reader from beginning to end just as forcefully as the PATRIOT act was literally rammed through by lawmakers.Each chapter captivates the reader by the very clever points and poignant facts. Ranum succeeds in presenting each point with a gripping sardonic crisp view.Ranum yet again lives up to his reputation as an outspoken security expert with prolific, inventive points presenting a platform for a cataclysmic change of the public's opinion of Homeland Security and the various other security agencies that supposedly protects the United States."
1,Confrontational Evangelism defended?,"It's hard to judge whether to rate this book with a one or a five. If one judges it on serious religious content, then it gets a one, if one judges it on whether it makes the reader laugh outrageously on the floor, then it gets a five. A fair number of college students will know Brother Jed's type: they're the extreme evangelistic Christians who stand on the lawns of campuses bashing gays, calling women who wear shorts skirts ""loose"" or ""fornicators"", and call men with long hair ""sodomites"". He assumes every college professor is a socialist, and that they somehow all preach ""anti-american socialism propaganda"" to their classes. (Where God became Pro-American all of a sudden is beyond me.) These are the types who become the caricature of Christianity we see in the media or editorial cartoons. Dangerous stuff, and should be locked away. This type of intolerance to other humans only appears in these fringe types."
5,Incredible,"Purchased this bracelet during a fantastic promotion. I was quite surprised how impressed I am with this piece. I wear several diamond tennis bracelets together at a time and have added this CZ into the mix. I doubt that anyone other than the savvy on amazon or a jeweler would ever be able to pick out the real vs. cz on my wrist. Stones are large enough to sparkle, small enough to not be gaudy. Clasp is superior to most. Highly recommend !"
1,This isn't right,"This isn't right. I've been hunting for this soundtrack and this isn't it. I distinctly remember ""Hang on Sloopy"" and ""Why don't you write me?"". They are missing here. I had it originally on 8 track."
4,A helpful little gadget.,"I bought this for my father who has recently been put on regular medication. He is a very active businessman but tends to get focused and forget to take his pills so I thought this might help. It has. The E-Pill Cube is not exactly the coolest looking thing, but it is loud and easily concealable. The compartments may be removed to make it smaller, for example, so it will fit in a desk drawer or a briefcase. It is also very easy to use, which may be a factor for older folks or people with arthritis. If E-Pill came out with something that didn't look so institutional, I would give them five stars, but this thing is just too ugly, even though it works."
4,A Marvellous Design At An Outrageous Price,"I take 28 pills per day - sometimes more. This is the _best_ pill-timer/case I have found. The 24 wee slider tabs and the nature of the nag-alarm are perfect for one who lives according to the dictates of Captain Clock.It is sheer evil for them to charge what they do for these, as wonderful as they are - but then I'm used to that by now. In America, health care itself - even nutritional food - is tiered: the wealthy can afford to live longer. Sheesh! >:o(One star off an otherwise 5-star design for the cost of the things. ""Don't Be Evil!"""
4,Great book; only a pity...,"Chesterton did a wonderful job, exploring St Francis' life and bringing his personality and faith to us. There is only one thing that spoiled the book for me: truly appalling printing errors - it appears there are no proof readers anymore... : it starts on the back cover where you can read ""Assini"" instead of Assisi and it gets worse inside the book.Still, I can recommend the book and if you can find a different edition, all the better."
3,The philosophic analysis of the life of St Francis,"For a book that's about 130 pages long, chesterton goes into excruciating detail. He makes references that most people could not understand including myself. This is a book written at a time for a time that never really existed. In other words, there are parts Chesterton says 'modern men cannot understand' not even himself... Why write the book if people will not be able to understand it. I recommend this book to those who have a read other books from similar authors with similar styles. I suggest downloading thesample first."
4,great purchase,"Great! This book begins with a description of St. Francis that is a bit difficult to understand but as you continue reading, the book is very insightful and inspiring."
4,Not for those seeking a rudmentart history.,Chesterton writng is for the scholarly reader. His discourse is more question and answer to the theological and philosifcal issues surrounding Francis than a history or biography. As my readings enlarge my scope I will go back to this title and hopefully appreciate the discourse more than at it's first reading.
3,More an essay than a biography,"When I bought this book, I was looking for a really inspirational biography about St. Francis of Assisi and his spirituality. I found SOME in this book, but I would suggest looking in other places. The first chapter or two are a virtually meaningless introduction to St. Francis of Assisi. The story of his life is pretty good, but under the classification of a biography, it lacks the biographical data needed for that title."
2,chesterton or francis?,"Chesterton is undoubtedly a fine writer and one can't help admiring his style. As a biographer, though, he is inadequate. True, Chesterton is not writing a traditional biography; he is writing an extended essay, full of meditative insights on a prominent Christian saint. However, a good biography should combine both facts and insights, with the latter deriving from the first. Chesterton's insights come mostly from himself; consequentially, this book tells us much more about its author than its subject.This book has some value because it gives us a peek inside Chesterton's head. It's an interesting view, even if we see a few things that aren't very pleasant. But if we want to learn about Francis of Assisi, we'd best go elsewhere."
2,St. Francis's image survives this book,"Chesterton loves the sound of his own voice, and does not complicate matters by offering any logical or insightful discussion about St. Francis. The author's verbosity gets down right annoying from the very start. He does, however, make one interesting point about Francis: he says that the Saint praises God much in the fashion of the troubadours of the day. Francis's love for God, suggests Chesterton, is almost like the intense feeling one has for one's beloved. Francis obviously was able to have an intense passion for God and man, a passion that was strictly spiritual in nature. This book's only saving grace is that it is about one of the most complicated, awe-inspiring men who ever lived."
3,Better to read Nikos' St. Francis,"I found this book to be over written and uninteresting. I much prefer the Nikos Kazantzakis book ""St. Francis of Assisi"". It's hard to find, but I heard Wayne Dyer mention it on PBS and I agree with him, it is very moving and life transforming."
1,What a misleading title!!,WARNING! Tis is a trap. This is a book about G.K. Chesterton HIMSELF. St. Francis of Assisi was used to flavor his personal ruminations.
2,Rambling and Overbearing,"This book was arcane and verbose which made it very difficult and unenlightening. The author digresses often and seems to add-in superfluous commentary on unrelated subjects. His references often point to ""current events"" which have long since lost relevance and the entire text has a dated, maze-like feeling.If you're looking for an account of the life of St. Francis of Assisi, I would not recommend this book. If you are familiar with the life of St. Francis and are looking for a commentary on the events of his life you may find this work helpful due to its supposed eminence among works about the saint."
5,Excellent,"If you are interested in how social movements take shape, and the political process which they must go through, this is a must read book. McAdam disects three social movement theories in a great easily understood fashion."
2,Worked OK for a few months.,"Worked OK for ~6 months then it started making a loud buzzing noise. Still worked but the noise drove me crazy. Sounded like a fan bearing going out. Couldn't figure how to open the case and take a look, tech support no help at all. It's sitting on top of a cabinet now, gathering dust."
2,Really Not Your Best Choice,"Fan ""burnout"" in 13-months so that the fan noise was annoying. A call to support elicited a recommendation to buy a new fan at Radio Shack and install it myself.Difficult to use on my network because of chronic problems with losing time synchronization, which complicates my automatic file backup procedure. But transfer speed is good and (until total catastrophic drive failure after 3 years) the fan problem was tolerable."
4,Buffalo Linkstation Network Drive,"So far, it has performed flawlessly. The setup was simple, directions easy to follow. I have almost all Buffalo network hardware and am very pleased with all of it. I had a question about the network printer setup, emailed Buffalo support and their response was prompt and helpful. I recommend it."
5,Network hardrive,"Very happy with the purchase - would purchase the same thing again.Very easy to set up. Had it up and running within 15 minutes. Works on a Mac and PC network without any problems. Get a battery backup for the drive - if the power goes out for even a moment, it shuts off and then you have to turn it back on (I have mine in the basement).I haven't tried to use the USB ports to add additional drives or a printer (I haven't needed to do either)."
5,"Simple, Quite, Convenient","We needed extra storage and backup for 5 computers in our house the Linkstation answered the mail. Reading all the reviews on this site, we must be one of the lucky ones. The drive does everything we ask of it including single-point storage and playing of all of our music (120g) over a wireless bridge. We use nearly all the features on the drive without hesitation; the backup routine was somewhat questionable. Our drive has been serving us for 3 months now without compliant."
2,Nice features but security and reliability are problems,"I actually have the 120GB Linkstation.I have had problems with the networking part of the linkstation. It seems to take my Windows 2000 and XP machines up to 3 minutes to begin talking to the Linkstation. Very annoying.Also, the linkstation only accepts 8 char. passwords. That's also a problem for me. It would be acceptable if it would ignore the characters after 8 but it doesn't. That forces me to enter my password every time I connect.Initially, I could not get the device to work with security enabled. I had to download a firmware upgrade.It seems the people that use the default settings with no security have had pretty good luck with the machine."
2,False Advertising,"The drive works fine and is easy to set up.However, it is advertised as ""coming with"" Memeo's backup software. Unfortunately, it was only a 30-day trial version (which is freely downloadable from Memeo's website, by the way), and there was no license key included with the product. What's worse, my inquiries to Buffalo's Tech Support to attempt to obtain a key for using Memeo were ignored. I hope nothing goes wrong with my drive, given the lack of response from Buffalo'ssupport."
2,Great when it works,"I have used one of these for just over a year when it failed. It worked great, but when it fails don't look for any support from Buffalo unless its not under warranty. If its not, just throw it away along with your data. They offer no help and no advise, just toss it."
1,garbage,"i regret the acquisition of this waste of time. it fails to accept files from either windows or osx if the filename is longer than a ridiculously short default, it's as slow as molasses, and it's bloody noisy to boot. also buffalo technical support is pathetic.mine is for sale once i wipe its disk ..."
2,This is NOT a Mac-compatible device!!!,"Although the manufacturer says it is Mac compatible and supplies a separate Mac setup guide, the device has a 32-character file name limitation! That means that you can't really copy or backup your Mac files to the Linkstation if any of them have long filenames.So for my purposes, this is pretty much a worthless device and I returned it the same day it arrived."
3,"Pretty good, but a little disappointing.","I bought this 6 weeks ago to serve as an MP3 fileserver for my 2 Squeezeboxes so I wouldn't have to keep my PC running all of the time. The main draw was that it would use little power and be quiet.Up until now, it has been both of those things. Unfortunately, it has gotten a lot noisier lately - buzzy. I did some searches on LinkStation Wiki forums and it turns out this is a common problem, whose source is either a cheap fan and mounts or a cheap back panel that vibrates or both. I have an email in to BuffTech, but it seems like unhelpful tech support is another common complaint.3 stars because it does function well, is very flexible with all of the geek tweaks out there (as long as you're willing to invest some time) and it doesn't seem like it has any real competition. Too bad it doesn't deliver on the quiet part."
1,"Just do not buy it, it is unusable!","Here is my LinkStation story. I got one in September. Within a month, it stopped responding after 1-7 days of working. I applied to support, and they suggested to replace it, so I sent it back to them. The LinkStation came as a replacement was a used unit, and in addition I had to pay taxes as if it were sent to me (Canada) from Japan, not the US. I complained again, and they suggested me to exchange it with a new box. Just when I decided to leave the used one and do not deal with BuffaloTech anymore, the unit just died and didn't start up. So I sent it again, of course. The second replacement I received was a new box, but it's crashing even more often than the first one, sometimes twice a day. Keep yourself from LinkStation and all the troubles related to this device and its manufacter Buffalo Technology!"
3,Not like windows,"Even with Samba the file system does not act or interface cleanly with windows. File level attributes cannot be set (like read only). You can only set folder level attributes. Also, if you add, rename, or delete a file using windows explorer you are forced to press F5 (refresh) to refresh the folder view to see your changes. Really annoying and very confusing for non-technical users who expect the storage to act like a windows file server.It's also a shame that some of the standard hacks that are available are not part of the system itself. Being able to configure Samba or at least a telnet deamon would help alot in configuring the linux OS without invalidating your warranty. Clearly, these things can be added easily. The reluctance of Buffalo to do so is bothersome at best."
4,Easy setup,"So far this has been a great purchase for me. I love the fact I can get some of the clutter off my computer and onto this drive. Initial setup was easy. Plugged it in and mapped drives on my computer took about 5 mins. The screens for setting it up are not so easy to understand, but I am still playing with it. I would recommend this drive for sharing music and files."
1,"Poor product, poor support","I have seen 3 of these in action now. They are quick and easy to set up, but if you have any problems, look out. Tech Support (24x7, yes...) takes forever. Expect to be on hold for at least 30 minutes, and hope that you get the one good technician, and not the trainees... These products should not be used for any critical info."
3,Buffalo HD-250 LinkStation,Set up and configuration did not present any problems. This device will be very useful in cutting down on all the paper that I have to store.
5,The Writer's Quote Book offers passages ranging from one sentence to one paragraph long,"Edited by Jim Fisher (professor emeritus, Edinboro University of Pennsylvania), The Writer's Quote Book is intended for aspiring writers combating writer's block, writer's of all walks, genres, and seasons, and book lovers who simply relish the printed word. Compiling the thoughts of five hundred published writers about the quintessence of literary life and what it means to write, The Writer's Quote Book offers passages ranging from one sentence to one paragraph long, each with its own distinct and often witty insight. Highly recommended. ""Turning out flashy, dense, complicated prose is a breeze; putting things down in simple terms that anyone can understand takes brainwork."" -Patricia T. O'Conner"
2,Not as good as the first Fantastic Voyage,"As the previous reviewer points out, the first Fantastic Voyage was not Asimov's story, but merely his novelization of the movie plot. So Asimov decided to write his own story on the same theme. Unfortunately, his was not as good as the original.Asimov had an enormous ego (if he was called ""The Great Explainer"", as the previous reviewer notes, I wouldn't be surprised if I were to learn that Asimov gave himself the title. He often bragged about the huge volume of output from his typewriter. The problem is that quantity does not equal quality, and much of his writing wasn't worth much. This book falls into that category."
1,Not worth your time,"I could not believe that this is indeed a book by Asimov and double-checked a couple of times. It is barely scientific, totally lacking logic and the finale is very predictable. I figured out the ""surprise"" ending in the first half of the book. The characters get developed during the book only to be completely shattered at the end. I really feel that I've waisted my time reading it."
4,Brava Shannon Drake,"Heather Graham, writing as shannon drake never fails to deliver her engrossing historical romances. This book was just like ever other book she has written but that is what makes her books all the more better. Knowing that when I go to buy a Shannon Drake book, I am sure to devour it from beginning to end, that's what makes an author top of the list."
3,I wish it had been better...,"I really wish that this book had been better, but it just isn't a ""keeper"" for me. [BookRack here I come.] All the characters are so predictable that any romance reader could pretty much plot the book after reading the first two chapters. I had to make myself finish it in order to feel that I got my money's worth. Heather, we all know that you can do so much better."
4,Good Beginner's Guide,Compact tome with perfect font for the mature crowd. Like the clear and understandable way in which the various topics are presented and the use of simple diagrams.
4,Building a Data Warehouse,"Excelent book, it shows how to build a good data warehouse by using the best patterns. I recommend the book to you, it is not as boring as another books regarding this issue, in addition it is cheap."
1,Very badly written,The first chapter is completely filled with run on sentences. I found this thing impossible to read. SCD is referenced in the index for page 201 with no other references in the index but the real explanation is on page 403. I think the author is sick in the head and should definitely stop writing books. That is why this one is not a New York Times Bestseller. Scaring 'techs' away with a first chapter like that does not help ideas get across to the reader. I definitely vote that this is badly written. Probably best quoted by literary professionals as do not be bothered with buying this.
1,Lot of unwanted content,This book does not cover the core dimensional topics.Lot of unwanted topics like internet security etc hassimply made this book bulky.Also the examples in Dimensional modeling is incompleteliving it up to the user to search other sources.
2,Winter Moon - lacks closure,"I am a huge Koontz fan, and the whole time that I was reading this, I was enjoying it. The characters were okay, the plot was not bad, but the ending was horrible. I can't express in words the dissappointment I felt after completing this book. Many of my questions were not answered when it was finished; there was no closure. I'm still scratching my head trying to figure out what the monster was...this is undoubtedly my least favorite Koontz books out there"
2,Very disappointing...,"Perhaps the most worthwhile part of this meager offering from Koontz is his bleak perspective on the downward spiral of civility in our society. There isn't much more to recommend after the first hundred pages. Koontz quickly switches gears away from the MacGarveys' struggle with the living, breathing monster that is L.A., and concludes with a tired alien/ghost story. The lackluster and unsubstantiated ending is particularly disappointing."
4,Great but what a lame ending,"This is one of my top 10 favorites of Dean Koontz's, and I've read about 75% of his books. However, the ending was disappointing and didn't leave me with a satisfied feeling. But other than the ending, I liked the characters and the way the book moved. I like his old style of writing better than his new style. His last two books have been a bear for me to read, and I don't like the characters as much. Let's hope he doesn't lose his touch!"
2,Put your brain on hold,"A thing from another dimension enters a ranch in Montana and explores us. It can take over animate and inanimate things, and doesn't know the difference, so it animates corpses. This would make a good short story, and it was once. It makes a mediocre novel. He just fills in extra words to reach novel length, with no new substance. All in 8th grade English. The one bright spot is his technique of keeping you reading on by stringing bits and pieces of expectation in front of you. Otherwise, it's not imaginative, original, or especially entertaining. Sorry, not recommended in the face of so many other better novels on the market."
2,NOT highly recommended,"I must say this was the worst Koontz book Ive laid my hands on. I thought the plot was thin, and the characters boring. I wouldn't recommend picking this one up; at least not as your first Dean Koontz book; because your first impression wouldn't be a good one."
1,I Peeked at the Ending,"Koontz is my favorite writer. I found Winter Moon as thrilling (start to finish), as scary (maybe scarier!), and hard to put down as all his others. But, with about one-fifth of the story to go, I began to suspect an ending I wasn't going to like. So I peeked, and there it was. BOOOO!!!Without that ending, this would be 4 or even 5 stars. I'm referring to the terribly disappointing relocation, not the resolution of the plot. Shame on Dean Koontz. Can I demand a rewrite?"
1,Koontz at his worst,"I have read numerous, maybe even all of Koontz's books, and this one by far is my least favorite. The characters were all set up well, but the plot went nowhere. It wasn't creepy at all and the ending was a huge let down. Nothing was answered. Not worth the read in my opinion. Very slow moving."
2,Not one of Koontz's best.,"I enjoy Dean Koontz's writing very much. He really has a style and prose all his own. The book was easy to read and started out suspenseful and the main characters were likable enough, but about halfway through the story, I realized that he was stretching out what could have actually been an interesting short story, into a 400-page novel. Although his demonic aliens were somewhat bland and unimaginative and the ending was weak, his writing style saved the book somewhat. `Winter Moon' will surely give you something to do if you're just looking for something easy to read, but it's quite far from being considered one of Koontz's better books."
2,Not his best work,"Bottom Line: LoanerNot every book can be great, and this book for me, was one of the not great ones.It was okay, ended up skimming a lot of it just to get to the interesting parts. The dual stories going on at the same time was a little weird, until the author revealed who the guy on the ranch was. Also, none of the characters really peaked my interest either.I'd recommend Koontz's Intensity or Icebound."
2,Not very good,"There were some scary, suspenseful parts in the book but overall I didn't think it was very good. Wouldn't recommend reading it."
3,Imaginative but dissapointing.,"Winter Moon would have been better as a short story. The first 300 pages are unnecessary drek. The characters are pathetic and bland (and does anyone else notice Koontz seems to have the same 3 main characters in nearly all of his novels? There's the heroic, faithful male, the strong female, and the young, innocent child). The story has real potential, as most of Koontz's novels do, but it is wasted in bad writing. It really seems like there was no editing at all, or if any, sparse and uninfluential. The book doesn't seem unsalvagable, but, unfortunately, it was left in a wreck on the beach. I would recommend against reading it."
1,Don't buy unless you're into masochism,"The plot of this book is so silly it's not even funny. The characters are one-dimensional, which isn't surprising since the dialogue is cardboard too. This is the kind of book you thought of writing in 6th grade, but you never made it past the first 5 pages; it looks like Mr Koontz is a little more perseverant, but that's not necessarily a good thing. How this crap ever got past the editor is beyond me. There are a lot of great horror novels out there. Save your money and buy one of those instead. You'll be grateful you did."
3,The Chicken or the egg,Okay when I read this the first thing that comes to mind is a cross breed of THE SHINING & DREAMCATCHER. The catch? Dreamcatcher was written after this book. Maybe in the end this book is just a case of two good (not great) minds that think alike. Winter Moon-does start off with a bang and keeps you turning the pages-so in that sense-the book is worth the paperback price tag.
1,NOT UP TO KOONTZ STANDARDS!,I have read just about all of Koontz's work and this is his poorest effort. Usually I can't put down reading his novels--but this one was work. Too slow and weak plot. Dean -don't write another one like this!
2,Very Slow Moving,"Winter Moon is not a good read. The first few chapters gets you going but it's slow moving from there on. I won't give anything away, but it's not Dean Koontz best."
4,Excellent Book,"The plot intertwines the chaotic city of Los Angeles with the eerie solitude of a Montana Ranch. It combines mystery and horror into one suspenseful, spooky read. I recommend it. The only negative is the ending which does not quite resolve all of the questions the reader would expect to find out about at the end."
3,"DEFINITELY NOT YOUR BEST, DEAN","This is a mediocre effort by the king. It had the SHINING thing going on with the little kid with ESP and a vague, nondescript monster trying to kill the protagonists. Ho-hum. Not great, but not too terrible either. Dean, take your time - you can do better. Check out the BAD PLACE for vintage Koontz."
1,Poor imitation of a Lovecraft novel,"I usually like Koontz, this is by far the worst novel I have read by him. VERY dull throughout and it seems like its going nowhere for a long time. The ending was especially poor.There are a few nice parts however and these are when he almost gets close to Lovecraft's style.My recommendation is to find and H. P. Lovecraft novel and curl up with it instead."
3,"Well, its ok","Its ok, but not my favorite. Koontz really beats around the bush here. Its a pretty good story, but not very well written. It took everything i had to keep me interested for the first part. He writes a good part, and then he slacks off for a while, then he writes something else that was interesting, then he slacks again. Most of the book you can skip over, but it would have made a good short story rather than a novel."
2,"Not his best, but has its moments","I found the first half of the book somewhat disjointed and a bit slow moving, rare for a Koontz book. It did congeal in the second half, and managed to hold my interest until the end. Koontz can do so much better than this, that I was disappointed."
2,Not one of Koontz's better books,"NOTE: a few spoilers in this review, so skip if you haven't read and mind hearing about minor plot points.Just finished this book on CD, and pretty disappointed overall. I do prefer Koontz's books that have a bit less of a supernatural theme, but even the others that I've read I liked more than this one. The main characters were okay, but the alien monster really never went anywhere and too much was left unexplained. The book ended far too abruptly with no follow-up on the characters afterwards (I was sure there'd be something made of how heroic the boy acted in particular), and there were parts that I laughed out loud at how absurd it became. He included a golden retriever as so many of his books do but the dog seemed totally unnecessary to the story, and introduced a glaring plot hole (why did the alien not just take control of him as it did other animals??) Overall, not his best work and a book you can skip without really missing much."
2,Probably my least favorite Koontz book.,"I found the first three-fourths of the book boring and slow moving. I normally love Koontz, but I do not recommend this one."
