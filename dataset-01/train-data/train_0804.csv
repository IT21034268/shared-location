1,too racey for us seniors,we began to watch the series but soon were turned off by the unacceptable scenes and dialogue. At our age we don't enjoy seeing smarmy pictures and dirty dialogue. the younger generation will probably enjoy this series but it just isn't for us. peggy shuttleworth
1,One disc faulty so far,I'm watching the series through now and I've received ONE faulty disc so far that stalls. The box came in shreds and looked beat up. Was NOT impressed.
3,possibly the most overrated tv show ever,"i just don't get it. if you check the imbd web site you will see that there have been literally hundreds of characters taking part in this series over a five year period. in all of that time i can recall only 2 major characters being totally sympathetic, the lady rabbi and anthony, david and keith's son. if you can think of another please let me know. aside from the ridiculous number of tragedies that confront every member of the family and those on the periphery it is virtually impossible to care about any of them. if i hadn't spent 200 dollars buying this i probably would have given it away or thrown it away. as it is i have merely sold it to some (i hope not unsuspecting) fan. caveat emptor."
1,FAR TOO MUCH GAY SEX FOR ME,"Had I known that gay sex would be so frequent and graphic throughout I would never have purchased this series. I grant you that the story lines are interesting but most of the gay sex episodes border on porn for me and my family. Was embarassed to have other people with us while viewing this highly rated series. I am not a prude but based on the ratings given, clearly many in society are more accepting of this kind of material than others. The DVDs should be rated X to alert people before they purchase."
1,Six Feet Under should be buried..,Whole series seemed to be about a bunch of sex starved drug addicts with no boundaries or integrity who constantly sought to draw as many others into their misery as possible. Glad I only bought this set from a resale shop.
5,Rediscovering this classic...,"I had originally bought all the original Six Feet Under seasons in their bulky packaging when they were released over the years. After seeing this was released, I decided to sell the old box sets and purchase this new, micro version of what I had. The DVDs seem to be exactly the same as the ones featured in the original box sets, and the packaging is great. I love the book feel of the whole set, and being able to flip through the pages to see scenes of the show as it progressed. For this price, I can't recommend this set enough. It's truly a series that has made me view death (and life) in a different way. By the end of season five, I had felt like I knew the Fisher family better than my own. It has been sad to let them go, but as this series has taught so well, loss is just another part of life."
3,"Love the Series, Hate the Packaging","SFU was a great show. The packaging on this boxset, however, is messed up. Many of the disks, but not all, have scratches or other defects on them. At first I was going to return the whole thing, but instead, ordered a replacement, to see if the problem would duplicate. Unfortunately, the replacement had scratches on many of its disks as well. So I just switched around the scratched disks with the ones that were in good condition, and will keep one version of the set. Order this boxset with this knowledge in mind."
5,very addiciting,Six feet under was a part of our family life. We looked forward to watching one or two episodes a night. It was well written and realistic about life living in a funeral home and business. All of the actors and actresses were wonderful. We were very sad when the story came to an end.
4,Six Feet Under series,"Very funny series that we missed on HBO. The Fisher family grows on you. As usual, the ordering and receipt through Amazon went flawlessly. Only complaint thus far is the closed captions of the first year's DVDs were in Spanish. Second year is English and hopefully the remaing will be also."
5,Six Feet Under : The complete Series,This is the best ! Every disc is in perfect condition . Thank you for I believe this has wonderful stories of a family with everyday problems at a funeral home . Thank you seller for such a great product !
5,Best purchase ever!,"The packaging is extremely clever, the entire set tailored to the likes of any SFU fan. I especially love the booklet entitled ""In Memoriam"", in which each page is a death notice for a different character, tying up all the final season's unfinished details of their lives and beyond."
3,Meh,"I remember when the show was on the air, it never drew me into watching it. It seemed kinda boring and weird. But I've got a lot of time on my hands and my job allows me to watch dvds at work, so I bought this box-set after reading all the rave reviews. I'm halfway through season 2 and it's basically what I thought it would be... boring. Nothing happens, nobody is very interesting, most of the time I'm pretty much fast forwarding through the episodes. It's a boring show. Maybe it will get better, but the best TV show ever??? yeah right."
4,Good Series,"I'm a little squimish so the death at the begining of each episode keeps me up some nights, but the content of the shows are pretty good. So I keep watching.~Donna"
1,adult rating,"This is not my type of series.I was surprised when I watched it.It should be marked Adult rated ""R"""
5,Great seroes @ a great price,"This is a great series at a great price! Totally captures a ""dysfunctional family"" sessioned w/just the right mount of exageration to make it interesting."
2,Cute but not cotton,"I ordered this comforter for my son, after seeing that it was ""now 100% cotton."" I've just unwrapped the package to discover that the cover is 100% cotton, but the fill is 100% polyester. Very disappointed, especially since the fabric is so darn cute and my son would love it. I was hoping for a more breathable product, not sweaty polyester to sleep under."
4,Excellent,"I was truly impressed with this first novel. The book is filled wih suspense, romance, humor and is a true pager turner. I can't wait for future works from this author."
3,Ray Ray,"Okay this isnt a review but a question I would like answered. What is the difference betweeen this DVD and the one that has a different cover and is about 7 dollars more? I can't find the difference, can someone please help me?"
4,Good but wierd way to end it,"I loved the action sequences and the character designs were amazing. The story though twisted and a bit confusing kept you on the edge of your seats. The only problem with the whole DVD was that the story started in, after I saw the entire DVD, what seemed to be the second chapter of the movie. The chapter last put on the DVD would have made the whole thing make since if it was put as the first chapter. So the DVD should be viewed in the order of Section 3, then 1, then 2.It had an unexpected ending but its a must if you like sorcery and fights."
5,Mah Review,Shamanic Princess was pretty good. I watched all three hours in one sitting. I thought it was interesting and the art was beautiful. ^__~
4,Good but not the best,"Tiara is a good character but the plot was so corny. It lact style and grace. I mean really her searching for the throne of yord witch was stolen is sooo old.But on the good side,the art was spectacular. The music was good and jablo was the cutest little partner I ever seen."
4,The Way is Open,"I enjoyed Shamanic Princess very much, and on a number of levels. Most obvious is Tiara's visual appeal, but at least as strong is the appeal of both the dynamic magical battles, with their wonderful ritualized feel, and the storyline in which nothing turns out to be quite as it appears. (...)the 'in media res' opening, with the backstory supplied later, is a perfectly respectable and in this case extremely appropriate method of telling a story: We get the main story first, and enough information to usnderstand it, then the backstory is given us, the main sory and backstory illuminating each other in a way a linear telling could not.."
2,Shamanic Princess? Blah blah blah,"I just got this DVD and although most of the reviews for it are positive, I would have to disagree with them. IT WAS BORING. It felt like a chore just to get through the first 1/2 hour, imagine how much more for the whole 3. There was too much posturing, the voice of the main character was irritating and I was dissapointed."
3,"Beautiful, deep...but so confusing!","I know that some people reviewed this anime as cliche and superficial, but I don't think that they even saw the whole thing. In this respect, it's better to get the DVD than the videos one by one. This is a beautiful, haunting show that really draws you in. But the reason why I can't fully recommend it is that there's too much story for only six episodes (they could have made a whole several season TV show out of what happens here!), you don't get to know the characters well enough, and it's so confusing! I had to have my sister explain it to me several times, and I still didn't get it. You'll have to get some info off the internet and keep it handy as you watch the show. Too bad... it could have been so much better."
3,"Pretty, but empty","Basically, it boils down to this: are you a fan of CLAMP design? If yes, you will enjoy it. If no, you probably should look elsewhere. I say this because the story is poorly choreographed and fairly cliche. The only thing outstanding in this video is the artwork. Some of it is very pretty. Overall, pretty much your average anime...all style, no substance."
1,Why buy this?? There are so many better card games!,"I'm surprised at the number of positive reviews.The best, and maybe only good thing, is the artwork on the cards...the pirates are funny looking.But this is a rather boring game that has almost no replay value. It's just same old same old each time. Our son liked it for a while (around age 10) but we're glad to not have this in our house any more.If you are looking for a fun card game you can play with kids, here are a couple games we prefer significantly to Loot:DominionFive CrownsWizardFluxKuudukBohnanzaCitadelsMonopoly Deal7 Wonders (I'm stretching the definition of ""card game"" a bit, but this is a great game too.)If you have a TON of games, playing this once or twice a year won't kill you, but why buy this when there are better games?(If you've never tried Dominion, get the original...we can play for HOURS on end.)"
4,Great family game,"We've had this game for our family for a few years and we play it regularly with the kids. We all love to play... it's a blast! It's easy to learn and teaches the kids some strategy skills. We brought it on a vacation when our nephews were along and they became addicted to it, so we bought them one for Christmas. They love the game. Great for kids who love the pirate theme."
5,Loot Hits the Jackpot,"Of course, the stars are based on how much fun your family has playing cards, and how ""durable"" cards are!The game is seems a little complicated, matey, while you read the instructions but makes sense as the game progresses. For more than four players I would suggest a second deck. The game can be long for younger kids, so stick to the recommended age of 10 and up. We enjoyed it and talked pirate talk (argh!) while we played. Yes, we're silly but it was a lot more fun and interactive than vegging out in front of the tube!Comes in a durable, heavy duty cardboard box, surprisingly. Nice packaging, and I would definitely purchase more products from this company."
4,Loot -- Good,"Fun Game, good for lots of people or just a few. Great for families and especially kids. Arrrr matey. Surf's up"
5,AMAZING FOR ALL AGES,This game has been a success with so many different age groups (combined). Its simple enough that younger children 3+ can play (maybe not competitively) by themselves and yet interesting enough that we pull it out every time we play games. The rules are so simple that new players can get right in and enjoy the game without feeling lost. LOVE IT and HIGHLY RECOMMEND for your game collection.
3,"While not the worst, not the best either","The game was a little confusing at first and the rules were less than completely clear on a couple of aspects of play. I think the idea is pretty good, it just needs more refinement."
2,Don't waste your money.,"I bought this game after reading some great reviews online. I thought it would be a good game toplay as a family as we've begun to have family game nights again. Needless to say it was a huge flop.We played it one time, and noone liked it. Not even my two younger children. The concept was great,the game play was not."
4,great photos and descriptions,"A useful book, but I did find it to be a bit biased toward hard-to-find English cheeses. Maybe because there are so many of them. Still, it's a good basic book on cheese, well-written and interesting."
5,A very thorough guide to age-factor studies,"This book is an excellent serious review of age-related stuides in second language acquisition. The authors are fairly thorough, covering a lot of research from the past 40 years. If you are reseraching the topic, the book is very useful, however, it makes very few conclusions and advocates very little. It is meant to give a reader a review of the evidence, and let the reader make his or her own conclusions. Any support the authors give to any theories is usually followed by caveats. The book is farily academic, and not a casual read."
3,Fairy Tale Horrors,"Nifty idea, purportedly based on a childrens story, where a mysterious pair of red (or hot pink) pumps makes an appearance in a subterranean transit system, and they transfer from owner to owner (or host to host, as the case may be) with obsessively paranoiac and supernaturally bloody results."
4,above average,im a big fan of Asian horror and this was a decent movie it had some great scenes and was definitely creepy. it wasn't the best movie iv seen but was far from the worst. and i would recommend it to any horror fan.
3,Decent K-Horror Film,"The Pink..errr..Red Shoes is a decent ghost story of a film. I found myself laughing at times when the mother would fight with her daughter over the shoes. The ending is a bit of stretch and falls apart when analyzed but it's a decent film that I don't regret watching. One thing I'd like to point out is that I really enjoyed the colors in the film and the way it was filmed, it had a nice unique look to it."
4,asian horror,typical story line. the acting was very well done. the bloody kill scenes were awesome. if u like asian horror movies give this movie a try.
2,Released in U.S by Tartan,"This Korean horror film was released in the U.S by Tartan Video Oct. 24, 2006. It is seemingly based on an old story about possesed red shoes that dance their victim to death. This one has a ghost twist and some other complications. Overall the movie is over the top (the shoes have a scary theme song) and it is an open ended movie. Rent first!!Storyline cut and pasted from that release:After catching her husband cheating with another woman, Sun Jae takes her young daughter and moves into a dilapidated old apartment building to start a new life. Heading home from work one day, Sun Jae finds a strange pair of high-heeled red shoes located inside her subway car, and decides to take them with her. Unfortunately, these shoes are cursed and cause unspeakable repercussions for those foolish enough to try them on."
5,Amazing detail,"The earthshaking battles of WWII come to life in this fascinating collection reviewing one of the most epic and disturbing chapters in history. This is a visually stunning documentary and is a powerful testament to the titanic struggles of those who lived, fought and died in a war that shook the world. Astonishing Color footage, taken from newsreels and captured enemy film, reveals the grinding intensity of campaigns fought in the Atlantic and Pacific theaters.WWII Battlefront covers the war in the air, or the ground, and above and below the sea in never before seen COLOR footage and captures WWII in the way it was lived and fought by soldiers, sailors, marines and airmen from both the allied and axis armies. 7 hours and 30 min long"
3,Color footage?,"It isn't color footage, it's colorized footage. If you can get past that distraction, it still is a good documentary series. I'd rather have B&W."
4,Love this eye shadow palette,The plastic case is cheap and breaks easily but I love the colors so I still use it over and over again. I tape the box together when the hinges break on the box. I wish they would improve the plastic box!
4,SpySweeper & Amazon.com,"Following recommendations I purchased SpySweeper from Amazon.com. As usual, the product was available immediately, shipped and delivered quickly. I am completely satisfied both with the product and Amazon.com. Thanks again for fast service."
2,Beware of renewing subscription - resets expiration date,"I've been using SpySweeper for 2 years now. It generally does what it is supposed to do. However, it was nearing time for me to renew. SpySweeper becomes a huge, irritating nag when it comes time to renew. Not only does the software bug you all the time, but Webroot sends out reminder e-mails too. With 3 weeks left on my subscription, I decided to renew, mostly just to get rid of all the nagging. Well, guess what? - the renewal process reset my expiration date. Rather than giving me 3 weeks plus 1 year, the renewal starts immediately, and ends in exactly 1 year - which means, that I've been ripped off for 3 weeks of paid subscription. Maybe Webroot thinks their users are too stupid to notice this deceptive practice of moving up renewal dates. I've complained to them - and if they don't make amends, then I cannot recommend this product to anyone."
2,WARNING! So So Software- BAD COMPANY !!,"I have owned Spysweeper for several years. I have found that a large amount of spyware is not getting caught. In many cases, a **portion** of the spyware was caught, Spy Sweeper did not remove the complete spywhere and I kept getting hits. Tried out XoftSpy software and it found and removed ALL of the spyware.Even more, I get constant e-mails from Webroot telling me that my ""Subscription needs to be renewed."" and that I must send in another $25 to renew. I got caught in their scam once until I started checking my subsciption date. They frequently send out banket e-mails telling people their subscriptions are up even though they may have as much as a year left. I have contacted them several times on this issue with no response or correction.I am only keeping this software installed because I paid out the bucks for it. I would not recommend it to others mainly because of the decptive business practices and the inability to perform as advertized. Look elswhere."
5,Great software,"I have really enjoyed Webroot products, and this software is not exception. It has a small footprint on storage and does not exceed resources or bog down your computer. I recommend this product for spyware protection."
1,This product can lock up your computer,"Upon installing a store bought copy of this program, my computer locked up. I contacted the tech service and they said it was not uncommon and I should uninstall and then go to a website to download. I did this and the same thing happened. Lock up occured during boot up and I had a difficult time just to get to access the uninstall function. The company admitted that this occassionally happens, but would not refund my money.I bought this product as added insurance to computer penetration and have refused to disable the other software I had emplaced in attempts to see if their software would subsequently work. Who can be trusted more, software that has been working or software that locks up your computer and then blames the problem on others?"
1,Poor product,"I work at Best Buy and we install this piece of garbage all the time. For one its a huge system hog and two it doesn't catch much of the pesky spyware. Also when computers come in to be cleaned up, no one uses this program (even though we're ""supposed"" to recommend it). I would recommend xoft, pest patrol, or MS Antispyware much much more."
2,"Good sweep, lousy support","I have to say that I have the same experience as others have noted with Webroot's lack of support. I bought two copies for my PCs. One installed and registered OK (not as easy as Symantec's Live Update system, but I eventually got it to work). Once that was done, it's easy to use. For the second copy, the registration system never worked, so the program refuses to update on the web site. There is no way within the program to register and no useful info on their support web site on how to fix this problem. I opened an online support ticket more than 2 days ago and no response. Waited on the phone for 15 minutes, then was cut off and told to leave a message, no return call more than a day later. For a program like this, if you can get updates, it is useless. And their registration and support system is BADLY BROKEN. I'd look elsewhere until they fix these problems."
2,Updated review - Best defense against spyware ... PERIOD,Initially caused some issues that have been taken care of in the latest releases and updates. Had issues after a few updates but the subsequent update always fixed the problem.There are 11 computers between 4 homes in my family and all browse the internet without any spyware issues. Excellent piece of software.
2,Disappointing so far,"What pushed this program from a maybe to a must was a test of my computer for invasions on Webroot's website. Their test said my computer contained a dangerous invader which could take it over. So I quickly purchased and downloaded their version 3.5. It could not find the invader, however. Tech support's response to my query: our test program generates many false positives. My response: what a sales tool!I've found that this program certainly detects many cookies. But I've found no way to distinguish those I want from those I don't want. After removing a bunch of them, web sites I use regularly no longer know my name.Without better information and analysis for the casual user, this program may not be worth the trouble."
1,I should have listened to you...,"The review below was written about a version of Spy Sweeper that was released several years ago. The program has been updated and the latest version is working quite well. (I can't speak about support because I haven't had to call in a long time.) If asked now, I would give it a rating of 4 stars.======= the following was written with my original purchase in 2004I read all the reviews that talked about non-existent support and paid attention to one co-worker who said Spy Sweeper worked pretty well. I bought it. I ran into problems. The reviews were apparently right. If you need help you're not going to get it from Webroot software. I should have stuck to Ad-Aware and HiJack This!Oh well, live and learn I guess. Here's hoping you don't make the same mistake."
2,Much improved now,This has improved greatly in a few months - seems their servers were having problems with corrupted downloads - now all is well and this is back to being a top notch program...
4,Another warrior in the battle against spam and junk,"Spy Sweeper found almost 80 installations of spyware on my computer when I first installed it. This program still needs a bit of tweaking, but they keep updating it (maybe TOO often), however it's a good one. While spyware may not actually HARM your computer like a virus, it definitely slows it down... a lot! Spy Sweeper does a pretty good job of getting rid of unauthorized garbage on your computer."
4,Best antispy software I have used.,"I have used several types of spyware programs, I am most happy with this program out of all of them. I found the program easy to use, update, and it finds lots of spyware. No spyware program will find all spyware, so you have to find the program that is right for you, and this is the one for me. As for tech support, they are great. I have never had any of the problems that others on amazon talked about. you go to their website and report a problem and they send you a ticket, and they will email you back when the problem is solved. I had one of my technical questions solved in less then 5 minutes, others have taken a few hours or maybe a day or two at the most, but I have always gotten a responce. That's my two cents worth"
1,slow bloatware,I made the mistake of buying a two-year subscription. Every upgrade slows the product down. A scan that used to take 14 minutes now takes over one hour. Stay away from this junk--there are much better free products available.
1,Had to reinstall XP due to Spy Sweeper,Installed Spy Sweeper 2.6 on Windows XP. Spy Sweeper overlayedMicrosoft License area. My system became unuseable and I had to reinstall XP. A friend who also bought Spy Sweeper lost Internet Explorer but he was able to remove Spy Sweeper and save his system. I have written customer support but they will not help or admit that this product has major problems running on XP.
1,Mislead by Manufactorer,"This is a good product but...Unfortunately webrrot feels no need to stand by its current marketing claims of:Free Software UpdatesSpy Sweeper is continuously updated to provide you with the most advanced and effective spyware protection. As a Spy Sweeper customer, you receive these updates to our software absolutely FREE.This is simply not the case they have now instituted an anual subscription update fee like the big boys. When I addressed this with them on the phone they suggested I take it up with the vendor ""Fry's Electronics"" they should have warned you.Our issues are concern over the future marketing claims made by this manufacturer. They will also say you should have read the small print... We guess their interpritation of free and the rest of the world's is a little different. Who knows what they will decide in the future.We are seriously disappointed in webroot."
2,I would not buy this product again,I am not sure that this product did anything other than slow my computers down. Much like the anti-virus applications I have used in the past as well. I think that by using products available from Microsoft there is no need for these third party application. But that is just my opinion. Does it work? I suppose it does. Would I buy this product again? Absolutely not!
4,"The MYTH, The LEGEND","The book, Knight: My Story is an auto-biography that begins in his childhood up to Texas Tech. As good as this book is, he is very bias. The tone he uses to descibe the people he likes versus the people he doesn't like is quite noticeable. Despite this he is a creditable author because he lived the expeirence. As you read this book you will notice that Coach Knight always puts himself in a goodlight when he talks about the incidents with players and fans that have made him famous. Overall, I love Coach Knight and I love this book."
2,Poorly written,"""Knight"" was written hastily and very poorly. As a basketball fan I look forward to any book that deals with the sport, and I also should admit that I am a little averse when I hear Knight's name. But the book is just another attempt to take your hard earned money out of your pockets. In the book Mr. Knight countinues to defend all of the controversial events that got him famous. He spins on the choking incident, never going into great detail, or a good reason for doing it. The type set is large, to give the appearance that there's a lot of writing. In short Mr. Knight has a severe weakness in character, and it shows with this book. I gave it two stars because it was disappointing."
1,It's unfortunate that he is mean.,Like the infamous Wayne Hill of the National Reptile Breeders expo in Daytona Beach Florida Bobby Knight has come to the conclusion that he is above criticism and can yell and scream and anyone he wants and generally treat people like crap. I don't like B.K. anymore than I like Wayne Hill.It's it a coincidence that they both are enamoured with the late Rev. Finis Jennings Dake and that they listen to U2 albums non-stop?I don't think so.
3,Its a pretty decent book.,"This book is about the story of Bobby Knight's life. His experiences at Indiana and a little bit about coaching at Texas Tech. The book does tell a very good story. it is very well writin, but it seems like the book will never end. If you are in to sports hardcore and are a big fan of the legendary Bobby Knight, then this is a book you will enjoy."
2,My Story,"Book was a waste for me. Nothing new in it. Tedious listing of his good freinds page after page. Hard for a long time Knight and Indiana fan to take this position. My perspective may be different because I have all the Knight books and have read Hammels columns when he ws writing plus for awhile I had all the Indiana games with pre and post game coverage on my satellite. The mid 80s book, Knight, His OWn Man much better. Better written and better content."
3,Not a KNIGHT fan but a fan of this book,"I have have grown up rooting for the orange and blue of the Fighting Illini. I have been raised to dislike the hoosiers. Bobby Knight was a great coach I will give him that. But he was a hoosier and i have been taught like i have said to dislike the hoosiers. ON the other hand i loved this book and here are some reasons why. This book give knight's story on why he exploded that day a few years back. It tells the story and life of a great coach. We can criticized him all we want to but he had great success in the coaching ranks. Most and I say most not all for the reason everyone knows, most of his players respected what he brought to the team. He brought a hard nosed attitude that ended up in victories. He was a great coach who made a mistake and this mistake shouldnt haunt him for the rest of his life. A GREAT BOOK!!!"
1,Impossible to get through,"I had to read this book for college and write an essay on it. I read the first 20 pages which took me an hour, and for a fast reader this is quite annoying. I honestly read everything assigned to me, I mean after all I'm paying for college so might as well get the most out of it. However, I quit after that first hour of non stop head bobbing and fighting to keep my eyes open. This book was AWFUL! Repetitive in every way! I dontunderstand any good praise this book receives. The book is also kind of commo n sense in how it talks about the tough time of women and slaves in latin amerca in the 19th century. With a little bit of intuition you can imagine what the book talks about. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME READING THIS LIFE IS TOO SHORT AND ITS NOT WORTH IT!"
4,GREAT QUALITY SOUND,"NOT THE MOST POWERFUL SPEAKERS IN THE WORLD, BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANTED ON MY DESK ANYWAY. THE SOUND QUALITY IS EXCELLENT AND THE SPEAKERS ARE STYLISH AND UNOBTRUSIVE."
3,NOT ORDERED FOR ME,"THIS SPEAKER SYSTEM WAS ORDERED FOR MY DAUGHTER, AS A CONSQUENCE, I AM REALLY NOT QUALIFIED TO GIVE IT A RATING."
2,dont waste ur money,dont waste the money i got altec lansing pair of speakers not only do they outperform but u have longer cables to put speakers where u wnt them these speakers barley have enough wire to go on either side and then a short power cord....u can save 30 bucks buy not getting these i thought bose was so great....not!!!!
4,"Since I have own this speaker, almost other speakers are deaf","I bought this speaker 5 months ago, not from Amazon but from an auction on Ebay. I don't think it was new but I have been using it almost all day everyday and it still works very well.The sound is great. Since I owned this speaker, all other speakers that I hear from offices, cars, shops... hurt my ears, maybe because I am an audiophile... It is great for music, movie and even game. Every sound is accurate, bass is solid and you don't need an equalizer in you computer.However, the sound becomes unclear and distorted when you turn it loud. You will not expect to hear good quality music from another room in your house with this speaker.In conclusion, if your room is relatively small, you need only low or moderate level of volume, and don't want to disturb the others, I would guarantee this is one of the best one."
2,Bad sound quality,"These speakers work fine, but they sound like they are covered with a towel. Much of the depth of your music is lost. In short, bad sound quality, if you care about that sort of thing. Also, the base started to distort at a very low volume (however, my equalizer set to increase base). My headphones even sound bad when plugged into the speaker port.They were far worse sounding than the Bostin Acoustics speakers that came free with a computer I bought about 10 years ago, which I was replacing.Luckily, the exquisite Harmon Kardon system is on sale for $140 (these are $80!), so I just ordered that, and will return these silly things."
3,Great sound,There are time the sound may have some static. Other then that great sound and can be used with all my electronics.
2,Not worth the money,"I thought Bose speakers for this price might be a bargain. Well, turned out they weren't. These speakers are not bad but definitely not worth their money. Biggest con: no bass control. Not a big problem when listening to music, sounds okay. TV and movies, however, sound kinda muffled through these speakers.Mine are going back for a refund, I'm hooking my old ones back up (Altec Lansing, years old, still good and better than these)."
5,Economical Companion,"I guess this is the lowest price item that Bose sells.Worth every penny!Speaker sound is very clean and nice.Must buy item for laptop users to watch movies.Very compact, easily transportable.I really love my companion 2. Provides good output and it won't disturb my neighbours too since it won't be that much noisy... :)"
3,Bose companion speakers,"After reading the reviews, I went ahead and ordered them anyway. I was swayed by the Bose name and the great price..sadly these speakers are just ok.. not great... I will save them and give as a gift.."
5,Outstanding,"I have never purchased a Bose product. I ve heard the quality in the Bose Factory stores,but the price was too high for my budget. As much as I would love the Waveradio,I couldn't justify shelling out $300 plus for it. I ve seen the original Waveradio at $199 here,so that could be a future purchase.I was in Sams last week and saw these speakers for $70. They sounded great in the store,so i picked up a pair. The sound is incredible from these tiny speakers. I use it to listen to CDs and my XM radio,and I couldn't be more pleased. The bass is powerful and the seperation exceeds my expectations.For $70, I made a great move. I know this particular brand has been discontinued to make room for the Series 2,but I am very happy with this purchase."
2,Horrible Value - Decent Speakers,"Bought these speakers expecting great speakers from the BOSE name. What i got was marginal speakers with little highs, and crappy lows. After a couple month the speakers started rattling. After cracking them open I found why tehse speakers suck:I paid $100 for two 5watt speakers. Yes, TWO FIVE WATT SPEAKERS!"
2,Not what I expected :(,"I bought these as a replacement for a logitech Z2300...I was highly excited until I plugged them in and heard. They were pretty nice, but hardly what I expected from a top notch brand like Bose...I plugged my Logitechs back in and they simply blowed the bose away as far as depth and resonance were concerned. The bose had good treble, but really not worth the money. I am returning them ASAP and am sticking with my logitech.Cheers. :)"
1,altec lansing has much better speakers,I bought these from sams club for [...] buck but even than they are not worth it. sound fades always for some reason. I had own altec before and now i bought a second pair. much happier with altecs : )
2,Bought two years ago...,"Made the mistake of buying this speaker pair to replace a Altec Lansing computer speaker system. As others have said, not a terrible speaker, but not a 100 dollar speaker either.Bose, which makes some very good products, sold out on this speaker to produce a crappy sounding bass and not much else. At least according to my ears, the 30 dollar Altec Lansing speaker pair had much better balance and certainly did a better job in the mid-high range.Also, my speaker pair struggles to hold its volume at mid to high volume range and really strains at higher volume. Almost uncomfortable to listen to at anything about mid volume...This speaker system has been in my closet for the better part of two years."
4,"good speaker, at least for 2.o system","well, i can't say to much except a good and a space saving sytem, but i prefer my ""huge"" altec lansing 621 for listening my music, but for 2 speaker that is considerably small... well...never heard somthing as good as this system"
1,wires are too short,"What a joke, apparently everyone must have their towers right next to their speakers. The wire they give you will not fit anything less especially if you are trying to hide the wide behind your desk. Have to go out and buy my own. Turrible."
2,Loss of Power Most High,"I got the speakers from a guy,who sent them to me on the fly,They were something I could afford,but they had no power cord.So to Radio Shack I did trek,dodging salesmen and other dreck,finaly finding where cords lurk,I got it home but it did not work.Sent it back two weeks ago,but the guy was really slow,i have no speakers now at all,I do now know why he is stalled."
4,Excellent for their purpose,"These speakers are a good introduction to the Bose sound, excellent as computer speakers. Excellent highs and separation. For casual listening they're perfect. I listen to these speakers a lot more than a more powerful full-range home audio system. If it werent for price, they would have earned five stars."
3,Decent sound but a little over priced for 2.0 system,Heard speakers at local SAMS club. Impressed with full range sound from small 2.0 system. Overall the sound is faily balanced but can be boomy or muddy with some material. Bought them for my laptop and will work well for general stereo. My Creative 2.1 system on main computer has much cleaner sound and better sound stage for same price and I can control amount of boost in base. Could use tone controls to help balance sound. Generally satisfied but expected more for the price.
4,Simple and effective,"I wanted a set of decent sounding speakers for my laptops with a very important criteria: NO subwoofer. I simply couldn't accommodate the additional space, wires, etc.That said, the Companion 2s work very well and deliver a satisfying sound at more than adequate levels. I can connect my iPod simultaneously via the second set of inputs, and it works great.I really like the minimalist approach - no decently recorded music should require EQ to sound good, and the built-in settings of the Bose work great on everything. I appreciate not having to screw around with more knobs.At $99, these aren't the cheapest - but then again, nothing under $100 is expensive so why worry? They work great."
4,Very good -- big improvement (surprisingly big),"I had some speakers that had come with an older computer and they really didn't handle anything other than the Windows theme very well -- I wanted something a little better, but didn't figure I would ever want anything that would rattle my boots. These speakers do a very nice job -- the sound is rich and full, much, much nicer than the ones they replaced. I listened to a few others that were a bit more with subwoofers and fancy features; these just have what I need, and now I can listen to music and be happy, and can turn on music when we do workouts (computer's in the same room) and be happy.I have always been happy with Bose products, and these speakers are worth the price."
1,Breaks!!! Do not pay all this money for junk!,This is my second Bose product that has broken in less than two years with just routine use. They replaced my headphones since less than one year but these speakers broke at 1.5 years and the warranty is up and they refuse to replace. Why pay twice as much for poor quality? I just bought Logitech speakers which are half the price and the warranty is two years. How can Bose charge so much and have such poor quality product....the speakers just have to sit on a desk and yet they break....
4,bass,got these bose a while back and they are very good but please remember they dont have a sub so they dont have powerful bass lines but scene the speakers are in a cased in such a large shell they give good low tons
3,Bose speakers,"It is a good product and performs well, but is overpriced for the limited use it is designed for. I feel that I could have purchased a lesser brand name of equal quality, at a much lower cost, to perform the same function and also have had an on/off switch installed."
4,Good enough for just $99 desk top computer speakers,"Bass is big enough without a subwoofer, sound is good enough for this size, and design is sophisticated enough for just $99 desk top computer speakers."
2,Bad to the Bose,"These speakers can not handle volume above low. I started using them by playing a Mozart piano concerto. I set the volume at mid level. Whenever the whole orchestra played a chord the sound distorted badly. The piano sounded washed out. I then played a B.B. King cd, again at medium volume. The bass was completely distorted. I tried moving the speakers and adjusting eq in itunes to no avail. Don't even try playing anything loud. It should also be noted that there is a fixed wire coming out of one speaker that connects to the other speaker. This wire is quite short which I found restrictive. Apple pushes these so I expected more. I'm very disappointed with these speakers. 2 stars instead of one because they don't freak out at low volume. Otherwise, thumbs down."
4,Works great for satellite radio,"I purchased these speakers for use with my portable satellite radio. They sound great, just a little bigger than I would like given I have to take them with me when I travel. All in all, very satisfied."
2,Disappointment,These speakers are just not very good and thats the bottom line. I bought them due to great reviews and I wanted more volume out of my iMac. It turns out that my built in audio on my iMac sounds better and louder than these speakers. The audio ducks in and out at 50% output and that is unacceptable to me. If you like to play your music - movies loud look elsewhere.
1,Have to connect to headphone jack only.,I only have a headphone jack in front of the CPU. I have to run the speakers from there. not cool. returning Item
2,orz,"I know you American likes the BOSE sound(and MacDonald's junk food. It's an american joke, www. ""www"" means ""lol"" in Japan.)In Japan, this speaker is one of best-seller speakers, too.Many japanese people who are not audiophiles like Dr. Bose'sspeakers.But I don't like the artificial sound of BOSE's speakers.I like an accurate sound speaker like DIATONE's speakers.The speakers made in Japan are best, I think.By the way, in Japanese language, ""BOSE"" means a shaved head, www."
2,Interesting but flawed,"Ms Suchard's book is fascinating, but rife with unsupported speculation. She assumes that Blake's views of Zinzendorf, who died when Blake was 3, are accurate, which in many cases is simply not true. I have checked her footnotes on many of the exxaggerated references to Zinzendorf and the Moravians, and in many cases the reference simply does not support the bulk of her statement. She labels any group that had any sort of secret ceremony or practice as being ""occult"" or ""Rosicrucian."" Occult is technically correct, simply meaning ""hidden,"" but it is a loaded word for most readers. She labels the Ephrata Cloister group as being Rosicrucians entirely without any evidence or documentation. Being familiar with Beisel's group, I have NEVER heard any suggestion that they had any connection with Rosicrucianism.The amount of speculation and sensationalism in this book undermines what should be a fascinating exploration of Blake."
4,get the director's cut,"Forget the other review. Okay, this is a nasty, adult slice of lowlife crime anime. But it is brilliantly visualized and compelling to watch. And the director's cut is the superior version, in that it shows the two main villains to be not merely sociopaths but deviants as well. It deepens the gloom and entrapment of the situation for the characters. Escape for them is not just desirable but necessary."
4,kite uncut,"It was a good watch and a real eye opener to those who only watched the censored version. Yasuomi Umetsu is quite the graphic person as far as animes go, as well for Mezzo Forte."
5,BEAUTIFUL,"This is the most beautifully presented book that I own.I have been studying Islam for a few years now and have hundreds of books, yet none of them come at all close to matching the beauty of this publication. This is how sacred books should be presented. I turn to this book again and again, it has an uncanny allure and stands out among every other book as something special."
5,Wonderful music,Our family just loves Michael Bolton's Christmas CD. It's not the traditional kind of Christmas music but if you like Bolton's voice as we do you'll enjoy the CD.
4,Att. Michael Bolton lovers!!!!!!!,"Michael has done a wonderful job of putting together this album. His duets with Wynonna and Placido Domingo are great. The version of ""Ave Maria"" is beautiful if you love opera or not. He show's his vocal power to do arias. This is a great CD to own if you like Micheal Bolton."
3,A GIFT FOR SOMEONE,CAN'T REALLY SAY EXCEPT THE PERSON THAT I GAVE IT TOLOVED IT VERY MUCH. IT WAS A GIFT. OK
1,Eerie & loathsome,"One of the most notorious, most successful thief in modern music history.But give this singing charlatan & his handlers credit! They have made off with more dinero than even most banks could count.Surely, most of the mega-millions that he has lured into his Cayman accounts has been female money; but I digress, maybe there are guys out there who are so accustomed to forgery, that the real thing "" is a thing of the past.""I just saw a picture of this vandalizer & was wondering who he's ripped-off lately. Does he have his eyes set, on a say, Justin Timberlake, the late Robert Goulet, a Brad Pitt "" Retrospective, "" or maybe a duet with Barry Manilow singing, "" Mandy?""Women, like everyone else, have to grow-up & if you're from the 60's then there is No hope for you.But if you are content with this very poor facsimile, then you get everything you deserve."
5,Second Best Thing Before Bed!!,"I have yet to order this item online, but after paying 10 dallors more from GNC than on Amazon, I will be buying it from here as soon as I get low on my current 2 lb. jug! Im use to eating a cup of cottage cheese every night before bed, witch in the long run cost about the same if not more than the Casein. One scoop of the choclate and 4 ice cubes with a cup of water and blend, makes a perfect night time treat after a hard day of diet and training like a freak... I HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS FOR THOSE WHO LIKE TO KEEP THEYR HARD EARND MUSSCLE!"
3,I Expected Better,"The ceramic piece fell out of the holder after about 10 days. They didn't use much adhesive. No real problem, as I used super glue which held fine. Otherwise, a decent product."
2,Nice idea,"The ceramic piece is prone to falling of its plastic casing. A little hot glue fixes this problem, but not permently.It does an okay job of filing nails, but not as smooth as I expected. For around $9, I would have expected a better quality product...especially from tweezerman."
2,Not Comfortable. Longer Nail Files Are Better,"What could be better than ceramic? Well, the old 8 or 10 inch ""Diamond Deb"" for starters. This ""blade"" is too thick and too wide, and it's also too short even with the handle extended to make filing nails comfortable or convenient. There's a groove in the ""blade"" which I think is supposed to be a guide, but it's set in too far from the edge. And the ""Cleaner"" is just a plastic hook on the end that is too sharp and too thick to clean. I might regift it next Christmas if I can think of somebody I'm not that crazy about. Oh, by the way, it does file, not well, but it does file."
3,Slightly Entertaining.,"This was a fun title to watch. According to the back, they said it was the animated version of Cybil starring Sally Field. I actually have seen Cybil and it was a very strange movie. I got lost sometimes since she had multiple personalities and we simply lost track of story sometimes since flashbacks later explained what another personality was doing.In this story, the main character has multiple personalitites. We have very few flashbacks in this story so it is difficult to lose place in story. This is a story not for children. There are a number of adult situations. I would give this an R rating for adult situations, nudity, and language."
3,well...,"This isn't a bad series. Sure, it may seem devoid of plot at times, and ridden with scenes that have nothing to do with what seems should be the flow of the movie, but it's still worth watching. Buy used or borrow a friends."
1,.........whatever,Another bad anime. dumb prententious plot. dumb naive charachters plenty of sex scenes. whatever
2,Best-forgotten Relic,Friar Tuck is a boring recording of mostly bad covers with occasional spoken lyrics over tired blues licks. The harmony vocals are amateurish. This best forgotten.[DW]
2,Not enough M6 screws and cage nuts,"The Bracket itself if fine, the problem is that it only comes with four M6 mouting screws and cage nuts, which means you can mount a 1U device like a patch panel but not a second item like a cable manager. Furthur more the a screws had an allen drive and key that came with them was the wrong size. I ended up having to buy a bag of 50 cage nuts to mount the cable manager.The solution: StarTech needs to ship the enough screws cage nuts for all the square mounting holes; in this case 8 and the screws should have standard phillips drives."
4,"Thought provoking, funny and worth listening to","This album is a wonderful mix of politics, humor, and philosophy that leaves you reeling. I Loved the dylan-esque style, and the ripping nature of the societal commentary. If you like acoustic punk, this is the way to go."
4,Channeling Dylan,Dan Bern sounds a lot like Bob Dylan on this early work. Clever but dated lyrics (Henry Miller references for example) show how much our culture has changed. Jerusalem is a wonderful song (I don't have to worry because I do love it that much).
1,Hmmmmm......I'd think twice next time.,"Bought this on a whim. Next Time, I'd do my homework a little more thoroughly. If I could, I would give this a Zero star rating. This is guy is a joke. What the heck is he trying to pass off as music anyway.I've been tempted to mail the CD back to him, and ask him for the 13.99 I paid for it back."
1,These are 99% bootleg listings,"Any listing that is not Atlantic and has more than 10 tracks is a bootleg available for $10.00 elsewhere. Tori doesn't re-release this because, in her own words, the album does not represent what her fans are looking for and she feels like she would just be capitolizing and doesn't want to release sub-par material.The album is mostly awful, 80's pop trash, even the songs that aren't bad are scared by terrible synth garbage. I have a bootleg I paid too much for before I knew better.I personally wish Tori would put it out again just to squash the boot-leggers and save her fans the money and embarrasement of over-paying for rip-off copies."
1,CAREFUL!,"While the album is a great throwback to 80's pop, more than likely the CDs being sold here are the bootlegs. The original release did NOT include Ode to the Banana King, Song for Eric, Happy Phantom (live), Ring My Bell, Happy Workers, or Workers. If you pay $125 and you get a cd that includes any of these songs, you've been sold a cheap bootleg that you could have gotten for $10.And to be honest... would the original Y Kant Tori Read album actually be worth spending that much money? Probably not."
4,It's not as bad as all that!,"I quite like this album. It's not Little Earthquakes, obviously, but for an earlier work it's got some good Tori-quirkiness,some unusual lyrics, and some songs such as ""Fire on the Side"" and ""Cool On Your Island"" I would enjoy in any context. It is 80s, but it's really interesting if you're a Tori fan. It's certainly worth listening to- thought not worth paying an awful lot of money for in my opinion."
5,i got a copy ! ha ha. u dont!,"this is definatly one of the best cds i own. its almost unawair thats its a satirical itmen now. its a VERY good cd. im not sure if i got the origianl, but who cares, THIS CD ROCKS!!!"
1,"Trippy, man, just trippy.","I also bought a couple of these at Home Depot to replace the PVC supply lines to the toilets from the water supply.Everything's been fine for the last 4 months or so, until today for some inexplicable reason I found one toilet would no longer refill. Now the FloodSafe mechanism appears to trip if the water pressure goes up past about 2 and 1/4 turns of the water supply knob.I didn't have to disconnect to reset, I just turned the knob until the supply was completely off, then turned it on gradually as the toilet was filling until the mechanism tripped. It still works, sure, but the toilet fills at about 1/4 its previous rate, which is not a huge deal but would be truly impractical in a home with kids for example with lots more bathroom traffic than I have."
2,neat idea but needs work.,There's to many problems with these. They are a very substandard. Depending on how close your toilet is and how much pressure that line has will create problems. Also these are not friendly with the Fluidmaster fill valves which seem to be the most popular fill valves. To be honest how likely is your line actually going to break to cause a full force flow for this to even kick in. My advice is stick to a basic mesh line and check your system yearly for leaks/wear and tear..etc...etc. Also check your water meter for any leaks. I have these on the faucets and haven't had any problem with those ones but again what are the chances that these would ever actually be necessary.
4,Helpful,"This DVD does a reasonable job at helping one think about tactics with pretty good illustrations. It won't get you to Davis Cup but more than worth the price, considering what lessons cost."
4,Not bad,I've watched this over and over and have found it helpful in getting my doubles tactics to the next level. Its fun to watch and I highly recommend it.
4,something for Jada,Jada loves bratz and I've been looking for something durable and exciting for her Bratz Big Baby. I'm so not disappointed ....and neither is she!
3,not safe,"Santa brought this kitchen two years ago. While I like the look of this wooden kitchen and the girls enjoyed it, I have to say that it is not very durable.The back and side panels are pressboard and have broken in several places along the bottom edge/feet. This means the kitchen leans in several directions depending on how you touch it and is no longer safe for my girls to play with unless it is attached to the wall. It is also slightly top-heavy for how narrow it is, and so already a tip-over hazzard made considerably worse with it's broken support panels.This kitchen would have been ideal if the back and two side panels were hardwood to ensure it was stable. As it is, I would recommend a safer choice. Either the moulded plastic or a higher-quality wooden one."
3,good item,"Very good and reasonable price, delivery on time,the item I found out that plug-in about half an hour,body of the camcorder is very hot,it's O.K. because mine is DCR-DVD, can use mini 30 min.dic only, no a big problem."
4,Motorola wireless telephone,Functions well. Phone book setup is straightforward but arduous. Good value portable phone.
2,Not what it's cracked up to be,"I've had this phone for roughly a year and a half and the buttons (especially: caller id, answer/on) on the receiver are not working as they should. It takes several attempts (presses) to get them to respond. I expected better quality from Motorola but now I'm shopping for a new phone system because it won't be long before I won't be able to use this phone altogether. Really disappointed."
1,Terrible,I got this to replace washers in my shower. The socket that should have worked for the deeper nut would not fit. All five of the sockets are mis-manufactured! The openings are concave inward. Don't buy this or anything else from this suppler.
5,This Book Will Change the World,"In the current atmosphere of mushy religion and sacchriney spiritual sentiment, it is refreshing to read a book of prayer and wisdom that so forcefully compels the reader to live a truly Catholic lifestyle. This is not for the weak, only the strong--it is meant for true men willing to reform their lives, turn away from the bondage of sin, and come home to Christ and Mother Church.It changed my life, and it will change yours, too (if you're strong enough)!"
5,As Simple as Theatre Gets!,"This is, IMHO, Gurney's best play. He supposedly wrote it just to get used to using a word processor, but in his fiddling around he ended up with a terriffic p[lay. It follows the lives of Andrew M. Ladd III and Mellissa, friends from childhood who keep in touch through their entire lives by writing letters to one another. It's masterfully odne; through the play, you see them grow further and further apart in social status, success, philosophy and the way they respond to their lives, but at the same time, they grow closer and closer with each letter they write. Very well done. As a side note, this is also a simple play to stage. It can be done with a minimum of rehearsal, and set/lighting/sound designs are a snap. But that doesn't mean you get a play that loks flat on stage: it's still a very powerful performance. I highly reccomend it to anyone in the theatre...or anyone at all!!"
5,A Wonderful Read,"Love Letters is a compelling story that draws you in, and never lets you go. By the end of the book, you feel as though you know these characters intimately...you share their emotions as they experience them and find yourself rooting for them. I fell in love with Love Letters when I heard actor David Selby and actress Lara Parker read the parts of Andy and Melissa. This is a real heartbreaker you are sure to enjoy!!"
4,Love Letters,"""Love Letters"" is a wonderful story of 2 friends who share their experiences of life through letters. A beautiful story of friendship through the written word. Great story to be shared on stage for Valentine's Day or anytime of the year."
3,"Following in the ""Wake""","""Arlington to Boston"" was the follow up to Emmett Swimming's first major release, ""Wake."" Unfortunately, the sophomore slump plagued the band the second time around. The band's signature sound, quirky college guitar rock, didn't change. The problem is that the songs on ""Arlington"" on average are just not as strong as on the debut. The highlights include the twin title tracks ""Arlington"" and ""Boston,"" along with nuggets like ""Living Room"" ""Fake Wood Trim"" and ""Parking Lot."" Unfortunately, however, too much of the rest of the material is repetetive and only occasionally engaging.Overall, a middling second album from Northern Virginia's college rock troubadors."
3,Oh the Irony!!!,"These guys are from Arlington, Virginia. There is also an ""Arlington, MA"" about seven miles from Boston, though. Unfortunately, this serves as musical metaphor, because while it sounds like the band was musically shooting for an East Coast roadtrip, it ended up more like an outing from a nearby suburb. Ouch. The song ""Arlington"" could be an anthem for disaffected tweenage Arlingtonions, though."
5,Gardening Basics Great for Gift,"I bought this book as a gift, but ended up keeping it for myself. It goes through steps to define what types of lighting are best for plants, and what exactly lighting is (some shade is a lot more light than I thought)I would recommend this book for any beginner!"
3,It's big in Germany,"Tatort is a long-running (25+ years) German television series about police officers solving crimes. (The title roughly translates to ""crime scene."") This CD apparently comes from a point in the series that two of the actors were also talented singers, so their characters would often sing a tune at the bar after closing a case.It's mostly American ""standards"" like ""As Time Goes By"", with a scattering of similar German songs. The singing is pretty good, but the CD is mostly valuable to people who aren't fans of the original show for the novelty of it."
3,"Innovative, and yet areas fall flat...","Having Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan perform with Eddie Vedder was a stroke of genius-- Mr. Vedder sounds as if he is singing in Urdu, and the intense spiritualism and eroticism of Ustad Khan fit well in this movie of spirituality. Bruce Springsteen also makes an excellent contribution to the album-- his voice explores the haunting qualities that he provided in the Ghost of Tom Joad. The other contributions are a mixed bag-- strong in areas, but otherwise not memorable. The album is worth purchasing simply for the first mentioned songs, however!"
3,Good but be careful with the techno terms,"This book's a great read for sci-fi and cyberpunk lovers, but other genre readers might get lost in all the technological terms. They get extensive use in this book as the author explains his dust theory and the physics of the Autoverse.As you follow the characters through mind-bending questions about reality and what defines life, you are bombarded with carefully crafted images of a reality that is run by computers, where people from this world can join the other to live forever (if they're sure that's what they want), and where you can alter your personality just by wishing it. You get dragged along as the action jumps from the Autoverse to Earth and back again as you try to keep up with where you are and who you're with.As you follow Paul, Kate, Peer, and Maria through both worlds, you will be able to put yourself into the settings but if you aren't very knowledgeable about technology, then you might get bogged down and lost."
3,"Good in parts, mundane otherwise","Permutation City certainly has its hard sf elements, but its essential hard sf core is not immortality (as heavily advertised and misunderstood), but causality. The whole edifice of the plot is based on a almost grade-school variaton of causality and existence, and leaves giant sf loopholes that some of the characters in fact comment on, but never and cannot answer satisfactorily. The only interesting portions I found were the ones that dealt with nested and recursive simulations towards the end, which were much more plausible. This was definitely a plod most of the time. The other thing that irritated me was its gratuitous use of names from the techie world for characters (Lesbegue, Riemann, Lambert,..)"
2,Thought provoking certainly but not enjoyable!,"I agree with much of prior reviewers comments about this book. Definitely thought provoking (but that could be done, and was done in a few pages). I found it meandered, lost its way, was generally hard work reading, and ultlimately I finished it because I had started it rather than I was getting any enjoyment out of it. SF is definitely my preferred reading matter, but htis is the first I have read of Greg Egan. Don't know if I will try any more Egan."
5,"Reality, let me tell you about reality...","The best science fiction isn't about science, it uses actual or potential developments in science in order to examine ourselves.Greg Egan's writing is among 'the best science fiction'. This book might appeal to techies who are just interested in the computer technology, but what it is really asking, like many of Egan's stories, is 'what does it mean to be human?'. He doesn't answer the question (how could he?), but he gives the reader more than enough to think about.Greg Egan's work is so far beyond the work of most dull mainstream (mostly US) SF authors, it is just ludicrous. Drop your Orson Scott Card, your Larry Niven - all your triumpahalist military SF garbage - and pick up Egan. You might learn something."
4,Best ideas-book I ever read!,"For the ideas (Autoverse is brilliant!!) I would hand out five stars and more! After having read a few disappointing sf stories, this brought me back to the genre!Unfortunately the narrative can't keep up with the technical descriptions. IMO the book should have slimmed about 50 pages, then it would have been great."
1,This book is bad,This book is bad. Its also not available for kindle. Also there's a description of a meal and the food is terrible and the portions small.
1,fascinating subject matter in a boring book.,The author has managed to make a fascinating subject somehow seem boring and predictable. At least that is what I thought of the characters and plot of this book. Although the book is only 341 pages long I thought it would never end.
1,To say this book is a complete waste of time would be an understatement,"This book was just good enough to keep me reading until the start of chapter 25, where I practically lost my lunch. I can't begin to count how many times I almost put the book aside due to the highly disgusting, graphic violence, and confusing plot. Then I would remember how much I really *wanted* to like this book, since I'm a fan of science fiction and also a software developer and computer simulation consultant, and I would continue on. This evening, I finally had my fill of the garbage and decided to toss this book in the trash, despite the fact that I could likely make $25 or so selling it. I can only imagine what's going on inside the poor author's skull, to create such a putrid book."
4,Very well done,I got turned on to Greg Egan's work after reading some of his great short stories in Asimov's Science Fiction magazine.The concepts in this book are beautifully mind-opening. I don't want to spoil any of them for you and encourage you to stop reading these reviews and just buy the book!I actually preferred the first half of this book but really liked it overall. I'm about to click around and shop for more of his work.
5,The first Egan novel anyone should read,"I was given this for christmas years ago, and started reading it with no opinion either way. As I progressed, there was enough to keep me interested until the large revelations later on - and they are truly epoch making.What really impresses me is that you can read it again and again, and still get a feeling of how the ideas expressed throughout the book have a fantastic internal consistency and recurring theme.If logic and ideas float your boat, you'dd love it. Don't worry about the characters being sketchy - they're just a vehicle for the ideas. When I finsished the book, though, I thought I'd really miss the world Egan imagined. Pity it didn;t go on for another 100 pages, or even 500!"
4,Australian SF Reader,"Egan takes the Paul Durham character and scenario that he created in his story 'Dust' and takes it further, adding other characters and personalities to his exploration of looking at the simulation of people and running them, or living in, a virtual environment.He explores what class differences will mean in such a world, while Durham works and schemes to continue his experiments with the help of others."
3,"Interesting concept, but a little thick","I bought Permutation City after seeing it referenced in an article on the existence of alternate universes in Scientific American. Having a casual interest in the subject, I thought I might enjoy the book.And I did, but I would not recommend it to casual sci-fi fans. I count myself among that group, and thought the story bogged down far too often in psudo-scientific detail. Hard core fans of the genre may be more accepting of this, and the premise itself is a compelling one.This is what kept me reading, despite the psudo-science that was in truth over my head and characters that were flat and somewhat underdeveloped.If you're not interested in AI or alternate universes, I suggest you steer clear of this one, but if they strike your fancy, its worth reading for the novelty if nothing else."
2,Barely Related Philosophy Ad Nauseam,"I have to be more generous than the one-star Awarders, but this book does fade quickly after the first section. At first one is deeply immersed in the events leading up to the famous July 20th plot, but the story almost immediately spirals into, what seems like, a never ending, discussion of a series of 19th century Philosophers that MAY have influenced Von Stauffenberg. It's a shame that such a great man, Von Stauffenberg, has his name associated with such sloppy dribble. This book has to go on my short list of books that I cannot finish."
1,"Breaking the rule of ""If you can't say something nice...."".","I really got sucked in by the description Amazon wrote; the book itself is a waste of time and money. It is horribly written, proceeds at a snail's pace, has little or no action, limited vocabulary, and hopefully I didn't leave out any of the good things."
3,Drop Spreader,"No one makes a decent drop spreader at a reasonable price. Treated with care, this one looks like it might give a few years of service, but I wouldn't expect it to be inherited by my kids,"
4,Precision Products Spreader,I have only used this spreader one time so far. It is lightweight and seems to do an acceptable job of spreading fertilizer on my lawn. My old spreader lasted for 30 years. I hope this one has a long life.
1,The Grand Duel (VHS) distributed by TIMELESS VIDEO INC.,"The movie itself (plot, acting, etc.) is good - Lee van Cleef at his usual excellence. But the ""quality"" of the VHS cassette is below any acceptable standard. On the video side, there are scratches and other blemishes throughout the length of the movie. On the audio side, the sound track is so bad that over half of the dialogue is unintelligble - just a lot of cackle, crackle, and noise. The poor quality of the VHS destroys any enjoyment one would otherwise get from a good western."
2,False Info in previous review,"This movie, ""The Grand Duel,"" is not a new title on the original, ""The Big Gundown."" I watched ""The Big Gundown,"" during the western channels Lee Van Clef month a few weeks ago, and although they are both spaghetti westerns they are not the same movie. ""The Big Gundown"" is MUCH MUCH better but doesn't appear to be on video yet."
2,Not Good Transfer,"Most of the transfers of this film to DVD are of poor quality reproduction. The Actual title of this film is, ""The Grand Duel."" It is possible to get a a good copy on double disc set with another Van Cleef western, ""Beyond The Law"", produced on DVD by Wild East in their 2:35:1 ratio, check them out.As for this DVD version, buy only if your a Van Cleef aficionado"
2,Warning: Only One Tray per Purchase,"I ordered this item thinking it would arrive looking like the stackable tray shown in the photo. I was wrong. For more than $13, you only get ONE tray. After closer inspection, I see that the description does mention that trays are sold individually. I must have missed that. My fault, I should have read more closely, but perhaps like you I have grown to trust Amazon's representation of products. Anyway, buyer beware - what you are purchasing is only one shelf. Will return for a more cost-effective alternative."
2,"Nice, but poorly packed during shipment (twice)","Nice and each tray stacks up on the other pretty well+securely. Though first time I received these they were bent/dented .. Requested replacement and again they were dented! The trays are made of metal and both times poorly packed during shipment hence getting out of shape, etc. Returned both orders, stepped into a Staples store, and bought a different type which was also nice + more economical."
1,Poor Representation,"I ordered the product and like others, I took for granted that the picture was exactly what I would received. I would have been ok with only one tray, but the one that arrived was so bent out of shape it was unusable. These trays are nice looking but not functional at all. Keep searching."
1,Picture is deceiving.,How I'm extremely upset with myself for not reading the reviews before I ordered. When only one tray arrived I was extremely upset with Amazon and the picture that is shown describing this item. This is a very nice try but not worth $13!!!!!!
4,"Great movie, but BEWARE, AUDIO IS IN MONO","the movie is great....not quite infernal affairs, but it's still good. however, i just bought the ""special edition"" (nothing really special about it) and it does have a cantonese, mandarian, and english track. along with the commentary track that's listed in amazon. however the audio is NOT in 5.1. each audio track is presented in glorious MONO!! The video transfer is not clean and the mono track isn't even clear. Try to stay clear of this DVD, i am sure there is a dvd of this movie out there that is better. This is the ""special edition"" released by tai seng. bar code on the back of the dvd is 01643 85624"
3,Running out of Time...,"You're a burglar, and you have 72 hours to live...what would do? That's the premise of this action movie...I found it decent (story, acting, etc...). Three stars!"
4,"Much, much better than Natalie Imbruglia !","I've just read reviews comparing Sophie Zelmani to Natalie Imbruglia. But Sophie Zelmani's album is really far above pretty Natalie's one (which I had bought for ""Torn"" only). Sophie has composed all the songs by herself ; the overall sound of the album reminds me of Neil Young's ""Harvest"", her voice is soft and beautiful and all the songs are strong ones, especially ""I'd be broken"" and ""You and him"". I'm looking for the second album and I haven't found it for the time being..."
4,A Life to Learn From,"This Bio/Diary has a lot that any Christian can learn from!David Brainerd was a man whose life was marked by suffering and depression. The diary is a constant up and down from one emotional and/or spiritual extreme to the other. What is so amazing is that God used this man in great ways...Not just in spite of, but because of Brainerd's struggles and afflictions.It is a book that can encourage anyone that God can use you for his work, even though we are far from able candidates. ""My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness"". (2 Corinthians 12:9)Not an easy read, but definitely a good read!"
3,David Brainerd: A melancholy witness for Christ,Excellent diary of the missionary David Brainard and his work among the Indians of the Susquehanna Valley. Truly devoted to Christ while struggling with depression but encouraged by a dynamic relationship with his Lord
3,Enough already,I learned what I wanted to know about David Brainerd in the first 10 pages -- but the diary goes on and on.
1,"Offensive, Repulsive, and Vile","This is a horrid piece of trash. Do not buy unless you are a fan of this group.I bought this DVD based on a magazine article and various positive reviews online. The images are asinine and juvenile. This is NOT music, but experimental electronic noise. I enjoy far out music (Sun Ra leaps to mind), but this stuff is ridiculous.Stay far away, please. You have been warned!"
1,Awful Disc,"This is the worst dvd I ever bought. I never heard of the Residents before, so I bought this disc based on those two other reviews. Unless you are a fan of the Residents, DO NOT buy this disc."
5,My kids love it!,"I bought the video of ""...Vileness Fats"" when it was first avaiable back in the eighties. I always enjoyed it but i also wished that the soundtrack had been mixed better. Well...here it is! (Along w/ many, many other great videos) here is the re-recorded and mixed version (or edited version) of ""...Vileness Fats""! It's freaking excellent! And so is the rest of the DVD. Even if you're just interested in exploring these guys, this is an excellent introduction."
5,Icky Flix,"First of all, this is a DVD. NOT a compact disc. It contains videos for: The Third Reich 'n' Roll, Constantinople, Moisture, Perfect Love, The Act Of Being Polite, The Simple Song, Kick A Picnic, Songs For Swinging Larvae, He Also Serves, This Is A Man's World, Harry The Head, The Gingerbread Man (concentration), Jelly Jack, Just For You, Stars And Stripes Forever, Where Is She, Burn Baby Burn, Hello Skinny, Bad Day On The Midway, and Vileness Fats. It contains 2 different soundtracks you can listen to: the original works or new versions of the old songs. All in all there is 60 minutes of video and 120 minutes of music. All of the videos are great and the new 17 minute version of Vileness Fats makes more sense than the old 32 minute version."
5,Vols Cufflinks,"This order arrived more than promptly, and I was very pleased to order and get it so quickly. Great job and many thanks!"
5,Awesome game.,My 7 year old and 10 year old LOVE this game !!! Its entertaining for all ages and takes about 2 mins to play.
5,younger kids can play too,"It says ages 8 & up, but younger kids that know how to add 2 single digit numbers together can play too. Or, my 4 year old keeps his power cards to himself but shows me his # cards so I can help him with the math part without me knowing his entire hand. Six year olds can easily play this game with no ""math aid"" from any adult. This is a really fun game to play. Our friends, ten, twelve yr. old kids enjoy this as well. There is educational value to this, as you are always looking at your number cards to see if their sum equals a number card you hold in your hand as well. You won't be dissappointed."
5,Great game!,"This is a fun game for multi-generations, ages 7-65! We have played this game for several years and still enjoy it. The artwork of the kings and queens are fun and colorful. The game is usually played in 10 minutes and can be taken in the car. What a great family game."
5,GET THIS GAME!!,"Terrific game!! My daughter can not wait to share it with her friends. The counting skills, watching her competitive edge come out, the mental process this game evokes is fantastic! I so highly recommend it for any parent looking to keep their 5 to 11 year old occupied for a good long time!"
5,Excellent Family Card Game,"This game is very popular with my 4 1/2 year old and 6 1/2 year old. It's also an enjoyable game for parents to play along. At the same time I'll add that it's certainly not a game my wife and I would play on our own without the kids. But it's an excellent family card game.The box says ages 8 and up, but if you throw out one minor rule that involves addition, your 4 year old will learn the rules after about 3 or 4 hands."
5,Our kids love it!,"Bought this game for my 8 yr old daughter last year. She and her then 4 yr old brother loved playing it. The 4 yr old even asked to play it when his sister was at school. Didn't realize it was going to be educational too- teaching addition is a plus for the younger one. The pictures are cute and fun. We as a family really like the game. We took it on a trip to visit family and the cousins (boys 8, 5) enjoyed it too."
4,For Kids,It's a great game... for kids. It is easy enough to learn and quick to play. Younger kids will absolutely love it.
4,My 6 year old nephew LOVES IT!!,"Got this for my 6 year old nephew for xmas. He loves it. I am being totally honest when I say that this was the biggest hit at xmas. Once I showed him how to play, that was ALL he wanted to do. Granted this is a kid that already loves card games and likes to have others to play with (he is the only child in a pack of adults). As much as he loves it, I think it could have been a bit more challenging for him. Since I played it at least 60 times within three days, I can say that it's tolerable for adults. The first 20 times were easier than the last 40... I asked my brother the other night (1 month later) if he still liked it, and he said ""yes"". He said they have made up their own rules to add a bit more interest to the game."
5,Great game for my 6yo,"This is a terrific card game, and my daughter and I play it frequently. It teaches some important concepts such as strategy, winning and losing,simple math, et al.The games run about 10 minutes and involve quite a few rules, so younger kids may have a problem keeping up with the game. I've only played it with my daughter, but I would think boys would like it as well.Overall I think it's a terrific game, and I recommend it to anyone with a 6 year old."
4,Great Inro to Card Games for Kids,"This is my daughter's first card game above and beyond ""Go Fish"" and ""Match"". My daughter and nieces play this without adult assistance for hours. I don't think any adult would love playing this game over and over again. The value of it as a kids entry-game 5 stars. The value of adult play, 3 stars . . . . I like how we can start using math for our 1st grader during discarding cards - I haven't done that until this year, since DD has learned math."
5,Lot of fun for all,"Fun game for the family! The pictures on the card or super cute too. I like that it is different from the average card game, more creative for sure."
5,Must have game for families!,"I played this with my kids who are 13, 10, 7, and 4. We all agree that this game is a winner. Beautiful artwork, quick play, fun theme, and easy to learn. Best of all is the fact that basic addition is part of the game in a fun way. Don't be fooled by the title; my sons love the game for the cool kings, knights, sleeping potions and dragons."
5,A BIG hit!,"I bought two of these games for Christmas gifts. One for my 9 year old niece and one for my 6 year old son. Initially, my son balked. I thought he would. It does seem girly. The fact that a kid came up with the idea didn't impress him either. After I finally talked him into playing - he was hooked after one game. Our family plays games to wind down before bed several times a week and this has become a favorite. Even his dad requests it. He's also taken this game to play at sleepovers with this Aunt and cousin.My extended family also has a tradition of playing games at get-togethers such as Christmas. Sleeping Queens was the big hit this year and the adults pretty much took over the one I'd given my niece just that day. Bottom line this game is FUN for ALL ages."
5,Great game for many ages!,"I bought this for a family Christmas gift. I can't count how many times we have played it because we enjoy it so much!!! I have 3 girls, ages 10,8, and 5. The 8 and 5 year old can play it by themselves, but my husband and I have played with them and had just as much fun. I love that the box is small and doesn't take much room when we take it traveling with us!"
5,Sleeping Queens is the best game ever!,"This game is awesome. It's creative and fun. Even my husband, who's not a big game person, enjoys playing this. My five year old son and niece caught on to it after a few tries, and my son has even learned to count by fives because of this game! My sister's family introduced it to us and we were happy to receive our own game as a gift. We've bought it for another family and I have a friend who called to ask where she could find it because her daughter loved playing it at our place so much."
3,Cute Game!,"My little brother got this in his Christmas stocking, and we tried playing it the next day. The instructions seemed complicated at first, but we figured them out pretty easily and had fun. The kings and queens are very cute, and it's kind of fun to think up complicated math equations using more than three cards. I also like how the six year old girl and her family made up this game. I don't really know what ages it's for, since Amazon's reccommended age is 8-14. I'm almost 12, so I'm right in the middle, but it still seemed a little like it would be better for younger kids. Anyway, Sleeping Queens is very cute, fast, and fun, and I would reccommend it to families who are tired of all the basic card games."
2,Fun for kids and adults? Kids maybe...,"I picked up this game based on the glowing reviews. I did not expect any deep strategy, but even kids games should require some meaningful decision-making. I have played six or seven rounds of this and I have yet to encounter any meaningful decision making at all. Zero. It's hard to dislike a game that is this cute, and I can see how it would appeal to children between the ages of say, five and nine. But good family games are both simple to learn and challenging to master and Sleeping Queens is only simple to learn."
5,Great Family Game! And Educational!,"My 6 year old mastered this game quicker that I did. My 13 year loves to play it, also. It is a great family game.It is a little complicated when you first learn it. But after a couple of hands, you will have it. It is very intuitive for the kids. As an adult I did not find it intuitive until I played it a couple of times.'It does teach addition and subtraction.We, also, play Sum Swamp and Dominos to learn Math addition and subtraction facts. It really makes it much easier. And everyone has fun!"
5,Great Game and Well-Made Cards,"We got this for our 9 year-old daughter to play during family game times. She was able to play the game right off the bat. It's very simple to understand, but it's complex enough to keep the parents engaged, too. The games are quick, so you can play for 15 minutes, or you can make it a best 3/5 sort of thing if you want to play longer.This deck is really well made. The cards are good quality stock with a good quality coating. The artwork is lovely, and the box makes it easy to keep them together. It's a high-quality box intended to be kept...like the box you put a board game in, only smaller.Very pleased with this product, especially for the money. We got more than I expected."
5,"Good for boys, too!","My six-year-old son received this for his birthday from his cousin (also a boy, who wasn't quite six at the time). The game appeals to boys since in addition to queens, it features kings, knights, dragons, sleeping potions, and wands. Number cards are used for simple one-digit addition, which many children now learn in kindergarten, so I think that the game is appropriate for children from toward the end of the kindergarten year on up. The combination of fun characters (brightly illustrated), strategy, and education make this game a winner!"
4,Great game for 3rd graders!,"This is a very fun game. It has a very 'paper rock scissors' feel to it in the fact that you have specialty cards, and other specialty cards to defend against said cards. Add the fact that you can discard your cards for a chance at better cards by creating math equations, and you've got a rather complete experience for your child's developing mind. It's fun, it's cerebral, just what a game should be."
4,Slick STudio sound,"Boston has a heavily produced sound which is not a negative. The instrumental tracks are elaborate and probably difficult to reproduce live. The tracks hold up after all these years and the compilation has many of their famous songs, although not all are their best. I prefer the album 'Boston.'"
4,A bit too much music,"Now don't get me wrong, I love everything about Boston (and the band). But they followed the trend of most big 70s and 80s rockers that on the greatest hits package they throw in some unrelease or new songs as well as their personal favorites that never were popular leaving the buyer kind of bewildered as to what to think of the album as a true greatest hits package. If you really really love Boston, this is a good album for you. I like a lot of their most successful singles, so I'm not too disappointed with it. Its a good cruising album."
4,Good...but not great,"I have been a Boston fan for years. To me, Boston is Tom and Brad, and without Brad on the newer songs it seems like something is lacking. However, there are quite a few killer tracks."
2,Pop Rock,"Even though I'm mostly into heavier stuff, I still really like the guitar sound Boston has (so much so that I used to own a Rockman Soloist). It's too bad that the talent and tone were wasted on the songs found on this disc. Part commercialized stuff targeted for the masses, part sub-par pop-rock, none of it really comes off as truly great music. About the only song I really enjoy on here is ""Don't Look Back"". Pretty much every single on here I've heard on Classic Rock radio about a thousand times, and the rest of it just put me to sleep. If your looking for a pop sounding classic rock album, go get a Scorpions record or something (e.g,. Lovedrive or Blackout)."
5,Smokin,"This is a pretty good compilation but I ain't such a huge Bostonfan, the best song is the very great, Smokin' which is one of myall time favorite songs. Buy their debut album insted."
4,never gets old,"Got to admit, can hear most of this on an FM radio, but listening to them back to back still rocks. Much of the later stuff Amanda is horrible, but the magic of the first album comes through. Be forewarned, the booklet expouses a bunch of goofy radical policical causes that detract from the music. Hard to believe anyone could make music this good and believe in such nonsense like the vegan crap."
3,"Higher Power, Lower Expectations.","I've been a Boston fan for 23 years. It's too bad that it took them so long to come out with a Greatest Hits album. The album is fine, but I personally think they missed quite a few classic cuts such as ""Hitch A Ride"", ""Let Me Take You Home Tonight"", ""Can'tcha Say/Still In Love"" and ""We're Ready"". Their fourth effort,""Walk On"" didn't impress me much, which explains why G.H. contains only one song from that album ""Livin' Without You"". It's great to here Brad Delp's harmonious voice on ""Higher Power"".Fran Cosmo and David Sikes have good voices, but could never compare to Brad's. Tom Scholz has a creative twist on ""The Star Spangled Banner/4th Of July Reprise"". Little disappointed,but long live Boston!"
1,Bums will not be shaked,"Boston is great.i mean the city.the title shouldnt be greatest hits, it should be greatset hit. The only good song is more than a feeling, which isnt even really a good song anyway.id rather listen to some music from a mario and luigi video game than this crap. im a fan of classic rock, not classic crap."
1,junk,"What a very bad joke! Boston are one of the worst bands I have ever purchased. They are one of the worst besides the Beatles. They are not legends at all. This is a really horrible greatest hits collection which has no good songs at all. More than a feeling is one of the lousiest most dumb songs I have ever heard.If you want a good collection of songs, go get Guns and Roses Greatest Hits insted. Stick with my legends."
4,I like it,"its definitely a great item to buy, i've always liked boston. i thought they kinda started that 80's sound before the 80's even started. so they were kinda before their time which makes them unique. i was not impressed with their newer songs on the album but the ones from the 70's and early 80's were pretty good"
3,"Good, but Could Have Been Great.","A Boston Greatest Hits compliation has tremendous potential, but unfortunately THIS compliation doesn't reach it! The album is very heavy on 1970s Boston, with almost nothing from their last two albums. Much more material is needed from Third Stage, especially ""We're Ready"" (a top-10 single) and ""Can'tcha Say""! In addition, the biggest (and really only) hit from Walk On, ""I Need Your Love"", is also missing, as is the title track. This CD, then, is not truly a comprehensive Greatest Hits, but a ""Greatest Hits from the first two albums"". Though I'm a huge Boston fan, I was rather disappointed."
4,"Boston's Greatest Hits, However......","Although there are some excellent songs on this collection, I am finding it hard to go overboard about it as a whole.The best for me are the signiture tune More Than A Feeling, a strong Peace Of Mind, the first class Don't Look Back and to top it all A Man I'll Never Be.Cool The Engines, Amanda and Higher Power are my least favourite tracks.I think I will look out for the remastered first 4 albums, namely Boston, Don't Look Back, Third Stage and Walk On, as I don't find this album holds together very well."
3,Can a greatest hits album be too long??,"Boston always was ahead of their time in terms of sound and composition, and Tom Scholz's combination of chops and electrical engineering geekiness provided guitar tones and ensembles that shaped the future of rock guitar recording. I bought this CD because I wanted to have the seminal Boston pieces in my collection. This CD certainly provides these in excellent remastered sound quality. So far so good. However I wish that the four or five ""filler"" songs from their less popular work were omitted (or placed at the end of the disc instead of at the very beginning!!). The disc would have been better without these songs."
2,Save your money$$$,I am a long time Boston fan and have the first three albums. I didn't really find any need for this album as there are plenty of great songs that are not included. Just get the first three albums and be done with it. They are full of great music that didn't make the greatest hits.
4,"A perfect CD, dragged down","As an owner of the original 'Boston' album, when I saw this CD, I was exicted. All, (well, execpt one) of all the great Boston songs I loved were included. I bought it imediatly. On the way home, I put in the CD to listen to. Suddenly, the song 'Tell me' pops up as the first one and I gasp. I look at the CD again to make sure it's Boston and sure enough it is. The CD isn't bad, It's accualy pretty good. However, They stuck in one or two to many lousy songs to keep this CD from perfection. It's still worth buying, though. For Songs like 'Foreplay' and 'More Than a Feeling' this still is a far above average CD."
1,I've never heard anything this bad in my life!,This stacks up there with Britney Spears and the Back Street Boys. I'd rather lick somebody's pits than listen to this.
5,Great music - but problems with the CD,Great music from a great band but I have problems (no CD in there) with playing the CD on 2 different CD-Players (Pioneer and Marantz) only on my Laptop it is working. How can that be?? What`s wrong with this record? Has anybody an idea?? Let me know. Thank you so far and greatings from germany!!!
3,righteous riffs!!!,"Its no surprise that most of the music recorded during the 70's sucked, Kansas, Journey, REO Speedwagon being only a few examples. ITs rock n roll in its last gasp for air, in its death cry. Boston were at the very least at the top of the game when they recorded most of these songs, stay away from new songs like ""Higher Power""(the cheesiness is to hard to bear). Listen to Tom Scholz's blast of hard rock knowhow and wonderful riffs on ""Piece of Mind"", ""More then a Feeling"", and other songs from their first 2 albums. The harmonies are so 70's and the lyrics suffer from more then a little lack of feeling, but the riffs and the grooves seethe and in some circles thats all that matters."
3,good but not great,"I didn't really know Boston till about a year ago when my stepdad told me to borrow his Boston tapes. More Than A Feeling and Foreplay/Long Time became 2 of the best songs i've ever heard and i also liked some of the others like Amanda and Peace of Mind. So i bought their Greatest Hits. I listened to it and found out it wasn't that great, especially with the new songs (Higher Power is the only good one). But it does have all of the Boston songs that I liked except for Something About You. So to make it short, this is a good cd but if I could do it over, I would just get Boston's debut and the Don't Look Back album."
3,Not Bad,"This album is about half excellent and half fair. The half that is excellent is all of their famous hits like ""Amanda"", ""Piece Of Mind"" and ""More Than A Feeling"". The other half is songs that are really not hits but just some average sounding songs that don't hurt the album but also don't do anything for it. Recommended only for someone who doesn't have any other Boston Albums."
4,Good stuff...,"For anyone with a casual appreciation for the sound of Boston, I think that this album is definitely worth a try. I don't own any other of Boston's albums, so I don't have the passionate opinions about the band and their somewhat spastic career that so many die-hard fans apparently do. I think this ""Greatest Hits"" album is solid.Of course, ""More Than a Feeling"" is a classic, as is ""Foreplay/Long Time"" and ""Amanda."" I even enjoyed the first two tracks, which were written for this album. There is something totally unique about the combination of driving guitars and soaring vocals that make the Boston sound, and this album captures that sound very well.Though the purists may protest, I think that this is a great album for anyone who wants to get a taste of Boston. I highly recommend it."
3,Goodie and oldie,"Whe they're first nation-wide hit came out, I was in boot camp. I remember hearing More Than a Feeling when near the MCX. Had a friend from Mass, who told me about these guys. If you like this little band outta Boston, you will like the hits."
4,Just as Good Now as In 1977!,"Very good sound quality. Brings back a lot of memories! I liked this album then and it means a lot to me now, CD qulity digital sound is awesome!"
1,This album is a great torture tool!!!!,Absolutely terrible recording from an absolutely terrible band! Please do me a favor and buy something else. Boston is brutal and this CD is a great example of how bad they are.
1,Pumpin' in the USA!!!,"I have never been able to get pass the horrific voice of their lead singer, especially on More Than a Feeling and Peace of Mind. The part where he screams on Peace of Mind is definitely one of the worst moments in rock history. Who could honestly like these guys? If you like this CD, you are a tool box!"
2,"Ok...you're named after a the city, right?","Why a band named Boston has UFO's on all their covers I'll never know or care to know, but hey, to each his own. This is 70's rock at its worst. These are long, drawn out songs with a lot of organ solos. ROCK ON. But really, there are a few good songs, but a lot of better ones on their first self titled album. It's obvious they want you to buy both albums by keeping the good songs on the original. For instance, Let me Take You Home Tonight is a decent song, and isn't on the album, while Higher Power (Kalooner Edit) which is God awful is on the CD. Whatever. Buy it and blow 10 bucks."
3,Basically the Self-Titled Debut rereleased.,"I used to be a big fan of Boston. You have to admit, their first album blows your mind. Since their heyday in the late seventies however, Boston has been on a steady decline. They should have ended it with the half decent Third Stage. Unfortunately, just as many of their collegues, Boston insists on releasing garbage by riding on their previous success. This is possibly the worst album artwork ever made. The two new songs are not worth mention and the majority of songs are from their most excellent debut. Four albums is no call for a greatist hits disc."
1,Save your money,"You would be better off spending your money on the ""Boston"" and ""Third Stage"" albums. Half of the songs on this so called Greatest Hits album were not even hits and received little to no air play. The best of Boston is on the the ""Boston"" and ""Third Stage"" albums. If you must have the song ""Don't Look Back"" spend an additional $0.99 to download it."
1,Just Get the 1st & 2nd Albums,"All the good stuff is right on those 2 CDs (Unless you like ""Amanda""...then simply download the sing, burn both CDs AND ""Amanda"" on one 80 minute blank CD for personal use. ~ Pablo"
1,"Skip It unless you REALLY, REALLY want the song Higher Power","Higher Power is a pretty cool song that doesn't a whole helluva like the Boston we all knew and grew up with, but if you want it very badly then that is the only reason to buy this disc. Otherwise, just buy the debut and Third Stage and if you have nothing better to do with you money buy Don't Look Back as well."
5,The Best Ever,"Boston is a great Rock band, everyone has to get this cd. More than a feeling is as good as some of the Rolling Stones' songs."
4,Just buy the first three albums.,"They made the music they wanted to make in a garage out on the east coast as kids. The classics live on - the new stuff is mediocre and uninspired. While such music is dubbed bubblegum rock today - remember that aesthetics play a role in quality music as well, you downtrodden Boston bashers. They certainly led that forefront in the rock genre. Why are these classics? Cuz they're good!"
1,Why I'm not happy with the Boston Greatest Hits purchase.,"I loaded this CD into my CD player in the house and my CD player in the car. I discovered that there are NO labels to the CD as well as to each individual Track. So when the music play plays the screen on both players is blank. As far as I am concerned, it is unacceptable. I feel that Amazon should have stated that this CD was an unlabeled ""remake""."
1,Misleading,"Boston had some great albums and great songs, although they did not have many charting hits. Why, then, is a CD titled ""Greatest Hits"" missing one of their greatest hits (""We're Ready"")? The answer: greed. The music on the CD is quite good overall, but the omission of a Billboard top 10 hit is insulting to buyers. And the music industry wonders why CD sales have been falling. Your best bet is to buy your favorite songs individually. Don't support compilations like this."
2,"Boy, I miss those old records.......","Boston, would have to be one of my favorite arena band out there, but I'll be honest with you, I hate this album. Don't waste your time with this album, go out and get their studio albums, they're a lot better and well worth it. A group with only four albums should not have greatest hits compilations, this is a perfect example, it's incomplete as far as I'm concern. Sorry Boston, even though I love your work."
4,"Finally, a Compliation","The star rating above (****) is incorrect. ***** should be in its placeAlong with 2 new tracks, too! If you've read any of my other Boston reviews, you'd know how much of a devoted fan I am, and this album doesn't lessen it one bit! (Read my other Boston reviews to get more detailed overviews)Tell Me - ****Higher Power - ****MORE THAN A FEELING - *****PEACE OF MIND - *****DON'T LOOK BACK - *****COOL THE ENGINES - *****LIVIN' FOR YOU - *****FEELIN' SATISFIED - *****PARTY - *****FOREPLAY \ LONG TIME - *****AMANDA - *****ROCK & ROLL BAND - *****SMOKIN' - *****A MAN I'LL NEVER BE - *****The other tracks are reprises and edits. I'm glad that songs like ROCK & ROLL BAND, PARTY, and SMOKIN' were on this album. None of the songs on this CD will ever age.Aside from tracks missing like WE'RE READY (#9 on Billboard Hot 100), CAN'TCHA SAY, and IT'S EASY were omitted, these are, truly, Boston's Greatest Hits."
1,This band is absolutely horrible. Don't buy this brutal CD.,"Brad Delp's voice sounds like he is trying to annoy the listener through every track. ""More than a Feeling"" should be permanently banned from sales or radio play. Jetboy's ""Feel the Shake"" is a horrible album, but is comparable to these so-called 'Greatest Hits'."
3,lacking,"i am a huge fan of boston. i dont own this cd, however, because i looked at the songs included on it and saw that it didnt have ""something about you"" which is one of their greatest songs. nuff said"
1,Brad Delp's fromp goes hand in hand with his voice!!!,"This CD is a worthless display of music. This compilation shows that Boston is partly responsible for the terrible music today. They are the originators of the squealing, annoying voices that usually get made fun of on Beavis and Butthead. This album is full of horrible squealing. You would be better off buying Britny Fox even though they suck as well."
5,"Ohhh My, this CD has to be the best.","Piece of mind has the most killer harmonization of all time. More than a feelin', Gosh there aren't words to describe that song and this CD. Buy it now! (at a store near you)"
2,"No, its not their greatest hits.","Instead of this, buy the first three albums. This suffers with the inclusion of new tracks and exclusion of more familiar material. The new material juxtaposed with the old is awkward, especially if you use shuffle play. The CD booklet means well in terms of the band's stand against cruelty and eating meat, but is somewhat preachy. If they are against cruelty, why did they release this? Back to the drawing board and see you in another ten years, Tom."
2,not all songs down loaded,"i could not get all the songs. i love Boston but wabtted all the songs, i did pay for all but 3 did not load onto my phone"
1,Incomprehensible.,"This is an incomphensible stew of absurd plot and tiresome teenage angst. You'd do better watching ""Party of Five"" or some other light entertainment. At least reality doesn't change around you. I kept hoping for an evil sort to come along and destroy all of the ""illusions"" and lend some stability to this confusing story."
4,"Starts slow, but is a good read.","***In my opinion, Jody Lynn Nye has created a twisted vision of what happens when we sleep. It is also VERY interesting! Who is to say Jody's world does NOT exist? I found this author's world of illusion to be fascinating! Juele is a character I hope to meet again some day. I enjoyed the book thoroughly.***"
2,"Interesting concept, weak execution.","The idea of a world where everything is illusory and anything can change at any time is fascinating, but the rest of the book in no way lives up to its premise. There are only about three characters in the entire book who aren't pretentious to the point of being repulsive, and those are fairly flat and uninteresting. There is virtually no plot, and the recurring idea that we should cover up what is real with our own illusions because they're prettier and more perfect disgusted me. And the characters' desperate reliance on symbolism, while somewhat logical in keeping with the theme of dreams, was tedious and overdone. A book I'm surprised I finished."
2,Ye Gad's this was bad!,"Sorry ma'am I didn't like your book. When reading a book I believe in a few things. The plot should start somewhere before the first 200 hundred pages. Character backgrounds and development don't need to be so well established as to make the first half of the book a bio for every character no matter how minor. Most importantly consistency is essential! If there is a set of physical laws in place, the character should follow them, unless explained for! The principle of the book was good. The main thing wrong though is that this book could have been done in less then 100 pages not more then 300."
4,First of a great series,"this isn't the best of Carolyn Wells' Patty Fairfield books, but it's the first, and it sets the scene for the rest of the series very enjoyably. Fourteen-year-old Patty Fairfield's father sends her to visit four different aunts in order to learn how their families live, and Patty learns about proportion, and what is needed for a comfortable home. She also goes to quite a few parties, and wears some nifty outfits--if you can ignore the fact that this was first published in 1901, smack in the middle of one of the more unattractive periods in the history of costume."
3,A Zsa Zsa Gabor Camp Classic,"This is one of those films that you can watch on a Saturday afternoon, with a bowl of popcorn, sit back, and howl. It is so bad, its great!My favorite line is delivered by Zsa Zsa herself, and goes something like this: ""I hhhhate that qvvveen!""A special appearance by former Miss America (1946) Marilyn Buferd is an added bonus!"
4,He is the voice,"One of the few singers who can hold a tune, even without a band in the background. Just a pleasure to listen to."
3,I only wanted one song.,I only bought it for Love Spit Love's 'How Soon is Now?' but was worth it cause i couldn't find it anywhere.
5,"This is the best Soundtrack , ever!",The Craft has music from some of the best underrated artist. Dangerous Type is the best song on the entire CD. And Under The Water is Jewel at her best (Even though she could of sang louder and clearer).I love listening to this album. Not even The City of Angels soundtrack can measure up.
5,This is one of the best C.D.s I've bought this year!,"The movie was incredible, in fact, I own two copies! The soundtrack is equally as good. If you want to purchase a soundtrack that rocks when you want, and is in your face rock n' roll, buy this album. My promise to you is you won't be disappointed!"
2,The Craft ST (between mediocre and crap),"The movie was very good.. However the soundtrack wasn't something I was ever very fond of. There is a great number of tracks that were cut out of the soundtrack that were used in the movie.The part where Nancy and her Mom buy a new apartment, and she had a jukebox that only played Connie Francis records. Well the song Fallin' by Connie Francis got the shaft from the soundtrack. The song is incredible and is credited as being one of the first rock songs ever made. Not adding this track was a fatal mistake for a possible purchase from your's truly."
3,"Great music, although some get a little boring","I bought this album for the song Dangerous Type, which I still think is the best song on here. It always makes me happy whenever I hear it. Other great songs are Under the Water by Jewel, which I think is her only really good song, and I Have the Touch by Heather Nova. Both songs have great beats and occasionally have splendid moments. I am not disappointed at all by this purchase. I recommend it to any one who loved the movie."
3,Not too shabby,"I'll admit I don't listen to this cd very often. Some songs on this album do not make sense at all, and it's not long until you get tired of them. One of my favorite ones is Tomorrow Never Knows by Our Lady Peace. Other highlights include Dangerous Type by Letters To Cleo, Witches Song by Julianna Hatfield, and Under The Water by Jewel. The track from Spacehog makes no sense, and it's annoying and irritating. Oh, the score suite by Graeme Revell is cool, and makes me think back to the movie. This is sort of above average. You either like the song or you hate it. It's just one of those so - so soundtracks that could've been better. I wouldn't really recommend it because only some of the tracks are really good, and the rest are just tiresome, or annoying."
3,this cd is okay,"i love the songs, how soon is now and dangerous type, there a few other good songs but u have to love those songs if u want to buy the cd"
2,"Galen, get a clue","Your reveiw of ""in the beginning"" was way off point and boring. Do some research. The song is a cover of a cover of a cover- that's all I'am telling you, and all you deserve to know. Are you 6?"
1,By far the WORST soundtrack I've ever heard...,"And, for that matter, one of the 2 or 3 WORST albums of any type EVER!!!I hardly know where to begin. First, there's Spacehog's track, with its annoying pseudodramatic ""singing"". Then, there's Julianna Hatfield singing her Marianne Faithful cover. One listen to that was more than enough. Thenthere's the Elastica song. As if those weren't bad enough, there was the horrible cover of The Smiths classic ""How Soon Is Now?"", where Love Spit Love couples an irritating voice with a total lack of feel for the song. That WOULD be the worst track on the song if not for the Heather Nova song, a track which shows promise in the beginning but devolves into painful whining.If you want a soundtrack, get the one to Mortal Kombat, Twister, or The Matrix. If you want to be severely irritated, get this."
3,"Dull, but with a few worthy songs","A mostly dull collection of unnecessary remakes (Juliana Hatfield does Marianne Faithful? Really?), but it has three songs that hint at a spunkier, fun collection. Letters to Cleo's ""Dangerous Type"" takes The Cars original and makes it playful, Spacehog's ""The Horror"" is far from a great song but it's absolutely an atmospheric original. And Elastica, go-to band for fun soundtrack songs, outdo themselves with ""Spastica,"" a catchy, clever two-and-a-half minutes of twitchy fun. If only the rest of the album could have the same attitude (and I'll give credit to Tripping Daisy and All Too Much do worhty filler)."
2,Unfulfilled Potential,"Certain soundtracks have a lasting impact due to the impression made in the movie. The true test of a soundtrack is to see how the music holds up to someone who has never seen the movie. Falling into the latter camp, I was given a copy of The Craft soundtrack by a friend who knew I was a Smith's fan, and wanted me to hear the Love Spit Love version.The writing should be good; Lennon-McCartney, Peter Gabriel, Ric Ocasek, Marianne Faithful, Morrissey-Marr. However, the execution left a little to be desired. That's not to say this is a bad album, but it's not exactly a great album either. For the covers, I kept wishing that I had the original copy of the song, with the exception of Our Lady Peace's Tomorrow Never Knows. I would suggest that people take a listen to the original Peter Gabriel, Cars, Smiths, etc. songs and then listen to these versions."
3,EXTRA CREDIT!!!!!!!!! Final examination Germ241F,"The dramatic movie Enough, directed by Michael Apted is about an important social issue, domestic violence. The movie portrays Slim Hiller, played by Jennifer Lopez as a loving mother who has had enough of her husband's cheating ways. Mitch Hiller, played by Billy Campbell abuses Slim after she confronts him about him cheating on her. The battered housewife never calls the police but instead runs away with her daughter. After going to a lawyer, she realizes the police can't do anything for her because she took too much time before telling someone. Instead, she realizes she has to take matters in her own hand. She trains with a trainer to help her protect and fend for herself. Self defense is a method of defending one self and is not murder. When ready, she takes on her own husband and succeeds."
3,trailer song,"I like this movie.While I don't agree with all the negative reviews, I do however, think it was semi-boring, and rather similar to other movies.The DVD did not have many features, except for like the trailer and J.LO's video.Can anyone help me with the title of the song in the theatrical trailer?if so....email me at kenzie_lymon@yahoo.com"
5,Entertaining Entertainment!Does it's Job beyond expectations,"I agee with the reviewer saying that this movie should be called ""5 stupid things you shoulnd't do when being abused by your hubby"".However, I found this to be surprisingly ENTERTAINING. And *that's* what movies are for, that is why they are called ENTERTAINMENT and not ""THERAPY"" or ""advice"". If ya need advice than seek a therapist, or read a good self-help book. If you want entertainment then see this movie.I especially liked the movie for 2 reasons:-THE AWARENESS IT GIVES WOMEN THAT SOMETIMES A MAN DOESN'T STRIKE UNTIL LATER IN THE RELATIONSHIP (in this case until their child is 5 years old!).-The FAST PACE and gratification in it's entirety."
5,Absolutely Fantastic!,"I want everyone to know this movie is great! My friend and I went to see it and we were on the edge of our seats saying you go girl. This is a movie you can only appreciate if you are not looking for the typical sex scenes with no plot.J-Lo was great and deserves 5 stars for this one,..."
5,And she does it again...,Jennifer does it again with her brilliant acting talents. Can't wait for her others to come out. Keep it up girl!
3,"""You're one of the lucky ones""","I usually don't watch movies with violence in it, but I watched this one because J Lo was in it. While the plot may or may not have been realistic, it does show how horrible domestic abuse can be. Many women face this reality everyday. Women, be safe, and Everyone, do what you can to help end violence against women and children. Peace."
4,Pretty good movie with one exception,This movie is definitely worth seeing. The only problem is that the ending works out just a little too perfectly. It is a shame that not all spouses (male and female) who are abused could have such a happy ending.
1,Enough said...,"Turkey with Jennifer Lopez as a victim of marital abuse. After finally having the courage to leave her husband nabbing her child in tow, Lopez moves to a new location and goes on a bodybuilding course to return back home to kick her ugly husband's (Billy Campbell) [rear]. Ridiculous, predictable film with a plot so wafer thin it's laughable.Enough proves to be another rehash of one of those shameful TVM movies about a battered wife who seeks revenge on her violent husband. Had it not had so many plotholes and miscast characters, Enough may have survived the critics test but as Lopez films go- this one really takes the biscuit."
1,Silly and Dangerous,"This might be a feel-good story where the victim rises up and defeats the victimizer, but that's how women get killed in the real world. Abuse is complex, as is the process of extricating one's self from such a relationship. If simply working out and practicing martial arts for 1 month would solve the problem of domestic abuse, we wouldn't have domestic abuse. As Lopez herself conceded, the most difficult part of her physical transformation was just LOOKING like she could beat up her husband, -- muchless do it. People see these things in movies and mistake it for reality, and in this case it could cost someone somewhere dearly. This movie is a cartoon."
5,Woman powering movie,This movie is true for a lot of woman but those woman need to learn the techniques that she does to take back control of their lives.
2,It's Aight.......,"Not much of a J-Lo fan, but the movie was not realistic, but was an ok movie. You can find a movie as this one any Sunday on Lifetime. If you still want 2 purchase the movie, my advice just wait til U can purchase it for $10 or less."
2,Where are the (important) deleted scenes?!,"The good: The little girl who portrays Gracie is one of the better actors in the whole movie and there's a point in the movie where you really think ""WOW, what a gutsy little girl!"" Appearances by J. Lewis. I guess if you're a J.Lo fan the music video at the end might appeal to you as an extra.The bad: Overacting by Campbell. The far out plot. The dialogue. There were plenty of things that had me wondering what in the heck happened. There was too much left hanging, like what happened to Joe? What did the cop REALLY mean at the end? What happened to her relationship with her estranged father? NO DELETED SCENES available.If you want to watch a movie with J.Lo watch instead The Wedding Planner or The Cell."
4,Entertaining but extremely predictable.,"the plot is exactly the same as (DOUBLE JEOPARDY) a woman falls in love, marries the perfect guy, has a kid with him but ultimately comes to realize that the man is psycho.as far as entertainment value goes, it's not too bad. As long as you know what you're getting into (revenge flick), then you get what you came for. It's not one to analyze or have a long discussion about afterwards, but it's pretty engaging while you're there. It's extremely predictable, but what made you think this was going to be a clever film? It's just a popcorn flick. Nothing more, nothing less"
4,great movie!! But....,my mom got us tickets to go see this movie i didn't think it would really be that good because the trailer but after i came out of the movie theater i was like this is a great movie! but i'm probably not going to buy this movie because it's really fun the first time you see this movie the first time you cheer and boo but i don't think it feels the same after so no i would not but i will sure rent it. Also it has like no features.
1,What we need ENOUGH of are,"people who think Jlo is a good actress. She's so mediocre it's painful, and nowhere is she more mediocre than in this piece of trash. NO spoilers here: if the title doesn't tell you what's going to happen, you'll figure it out 15 minutes into the flick.Yes, there are a million inconsistencies, yes, you wonder if Lopez' character could put even more trauma on her daughter, and yes, you understand why this thing bombed at the box office.Spousal abuse is a horrible thing, and deserves far more respect than this film. And if you were a wife finally looking to get even with your abusive husband, after you snuck into his house, wouldn't the first thing YOU do be change into a skin-tight black outfit? And where did she get those ""magic"" detecting devices? Save your money. Watch TV instead."
2,This movie plot is getting old.,"ENOUGH! The film makers are about to drive this plot into the ground. Hard working pretty woman (Lopez) meets up with handsome hunk, has a fairy-tale wedding, and then dreams of living a fairy-tale life. All this only to find out her wonderful husband is a jerk. He chases other women and he is abusive to her. She's on the run and he's trying to find her. Naturally, he's rich and has inside connections with the law enforcement agency, so hubby has no trouble tracking her down. And naturally, he's going to take her to court to get the child away from her. So the wife sends her daughter away for a month so the wife can be by herself to enroll in a class and take instructions on how to physically kick the ... out of an attacker of any size. Hollywood needs to give this scene a break. Really. Lopez is okay, but she should probably stick to singing, or wait for a better film script to come along."
3,Animal Instinct,"I rather enjoyed the movie. the beginning was a little slow, but from then on it was captivating. Some scenes made your jaw drop with amazement and others just made you feel sorry for ""Slim"". Jennifer Lopez played a very good role. She is every battered woman's role model. It took her a while to realize what she needed to do. For one, her husband had tons of money and she had none. She had no education, no skills, and no one to turn to for any real help. Once, she found out what it was going to take to get what she wanted, nothing could stop her. I think the way she did it was a little extreme because I have never been battered, but in the end she got what she wanted. I'm not sure if this would actually work in the real world, but if a woman is at her wits end, she will do anything to protect herself and her child."
3,entertaining enough,"This can be a decent Saturday night movie if you look at it the right way. Jennifer Lopez delivers a solid acting performance as always, as do Billy Campbell as the manipulative maniac whom J Lo's character marries--his behaviors are a tad crazier and more ridiculous than anything you'd see or hear about anyone in real life, but hey, what do you expect, it's Hollywood. Tessa Allen plays the little daughter who, at three years old, actually holds the movie together in some ways, keeps the story where it needs to be, and offers a little bit of hope. She's a cutie too--not an annoying little brat you might expect. Overall, I think it's at least worth a rental, if you like thrillers."
4,Pleasant surprise,"I was pleasantly surprised to see what a good job Jennifer Lopez did in this movie. Plus, the little girl was totally incredible! Seeing Billy Campbell playing such a bad guy was a little difficult for me because I like him so much, but he was pretty convincing!All in all, I really enjoyed this movie; much more than I thought I would."
1,Not nearly enough,"This is a pretty basic story of a female victim being abused and harassed by a male aggressor. Typically, in these story lines the aggressor performs a series of mean things (so the viewers will hate him) and victim exhausts all peaceful remedies. At the conclusion, the victim fights back with devastating consequences. This movie is no different.Perhaps the best asset of this movie is popular exposure to the Israeli self-defense system of Krav Maga. Sadly, it is only touched upon in the story. I was hoping that we would see Krav Maga training throughout the story leading up to the inevitable final conflict, but this didn't happen. In the story, our heroine trains for about 3 weeks before facing the enemy...in movie time, that means we get to see about 5 minutes of self-defense training near the end of the show."
2,Funny because it's so lame,"I have to say, this is by FAR one of the most camp movies I've ever seen in my life. Well, J-Lo fans would probably like it. The acting is so melodramatic, it's ridiculous. Entirely predictable, cheesy to the extreme, this film is only good for one thing...a laugh. Seriously, it's that dumb."
2,A weak Julia Roberts [remake],"Lopez plays a waitress who marries her dream guy, only to find that he is cheating on her and will beat her whenever he feels like it. She decides to bolt with her daughter and he begins stalking her. Eventually she is told there is nothing the police can do and it will be up to her...hence the title of the movie....Billy Campbell was mildly entertaining as her husband a.k.a. the villain but that was about it. Lopez isn't that engaging of an actress and the movie is really hurt by that.Also the editing of the movie was just atrocious. Whoever thought to put up the different titles of the various sections (similar to what you would see in a Frasier episode) was an [dumb]. Any time the movie began to make any attempt at building tension, it was busted up by a black screen with a new title.Say enough is enough and don't see this one."
1,made for tv movies are better than this,"it's pathetic of jennifer lopez to take a role in an ALREADY overdone type of movie storyline! in this movie we see the famous jennifer lopez playing a beaten house wife who moves,changes herself,who basically does ANYthing in her power to escape the one guy she thought was perfect! then she gets tired of him stalking her so she takes some self-denfense class and beats him up!Unfortently storylines like this have been played out for years on made for tv movies,only difference is the acting was believeable!skip this movie."
1,This movie [stinks],"This has to be one of the worst movies that i have ever seen. I would of given it 0 stars but that wasn't an option. But I guess it's ok to give it a start just because J to the [Lo] is phat. But why the heck did they put in subtitles for each part of the movie. I mean you're watching it in the theatre and then they display a title. I could understand if it was a dvd but it wasn't. The plot is terrible. Slim, lopez's character, and what kind of name is that, found out that her new husband, who also called her by her nickname, slim, was cheating on her and her husband thought that it was a good thing because now he didn't have to hide it. But even though he was cheating with numerous women he still wanted her as his wife and she left him and he tracked her down and tried to kill her..."
4,Incredible!!!,"I don't understand why so many critics panned this film starring the ubiquitous Jennifer Lopez, but I rather enjoyed the film.""Enough"" is a film about a woman who marries what she thinks is the perfect man, but who turns out to be a nightmare. He cheats on her and throws it in her face, and he also is abusive. Jennifer Lopez's main concern is protecting her daughter from all of the pain and anguish that her husband has put into their lives.This movie is filled with a lot of suspense and jumps, which reminds me of a similar film, ""Sleeping With the Enemy.""The climactic scene at the end where Jennifer Lopez's character finally gives her husband what he deserves will have you cheering in your seats. If nothing else, this film can show people, especially women, that no matter how small or weak you are, you can still protect yourself and the lives of your children from anyone who tries to hurt them.Watch this movie!"
5,Enough (Ws),"J Lo was real and intense in this movie. I've been there, done part of that, and felt it was great to see the ending. Really great."
3,Close to home for some of us,"Husband is a classic Narcissist. Few can live through their reign of domination. Those interested in a deeper look might read ""The Sociopath Next Door""."
2,"Not a horrible movie, but not the best.","This movie I have to say is just not good. I understand it's about an abused wife, trying to get away with her little girl, but the plot, the dialouge just everything about this movie is deffinitely not worth buying.I would reccomend renting it first."
1,ENOUGH!,"COULDN'T MAKE IT PAST THE FIRST 30 MINUTES! SEEN ENOUGH OF THESE FLICKS. ANOTHER PSYCHO HUSBAND TO DEAL WITH. KEPT WAITING FOR IT TO GET BETTER, BUT COULDN'T HANG IN THERE. GOOD LUCK!"
1,dissapointed,"dissapointd no cover case .. it would have been nice wen showing price of movie would have been notifyd no cover case , thn would hv made decision to purchace diffrnt movie"
2,not that great...,"The movie had a good message about domestic violence and how a woman shouldn't have to deal with it and she should find a way to protect herself. But overall, it was just the same as those on Lifetime and other made for tv movies."
3,ENOUGH IS ENOUGH ALREADY!!!!!,"This movie had a great plot but it was kind of naive on Jennifer's character's part. I mean c'mon, if a guy cheats and hits you, what you're just going to stand there and take it... HELL NO, not me maybe some other water headed girl out there. I bet Slim's only excuse for staying as long as she did was because of her daughter, but I wouldn't want my child to see that his/her father is hitting me. And what's so corny about this movie is that in the beginning of the movie Slim portrayed this kind of sweet and innocent and please take care of me image, then closer to the end she was like all tough. But besides these little things I didn't like this movie was alright, but it wasn't Jen's best performance."
3,Good Quality,"The quality was really good, however, there were times it would freeze even though my internet connection had great connection. But, overall it was a good movie."
3,"More like 2 1/2 stars, but they won't let me do 1/2s.","I waited quite awhile to see this one, because of all the horrible reviews I'd read & heard. Really not at all as bad as I'd expected. Not one I would've wanted to spend time & money seeing in the theater but worth renting. Maybe with a different cast would've been worse, but I love J Lo & great supporting cast so that worked for me."
4,THE 2ND GOOD MOVIE SHE MADE,"I THOUGHT IT WAS THE 2ND GOOD MOVIE SHE MADE SELENA WAS THE BEST THEN ENOUGH, ANGEL EYES THEN THE WEDDING PLANNER BUT I WOULD STILL RATHER WATCH A HORROR MOVIE OUR AN ADAM SANDLER MOVIE THAN HER"
2,"Mediocre film, mediocre actress","I have a lot of respect for J.Lo and all the things she does, but I am mystified that she continuously works in film. Her acting skills have grossly deteriorated over the years and she is proof positive that this country rewards mediocracy over superior talent. In Enough, J.Lo plays a battered wife who seeks revenge on her husband, but the plot is so thin and unbelievable that the movie fails to rise above average. True to form, Lopez fails to bring anything to the movie other than memorized lines. Save you time/don't waste your money!"
4,Even men can cheer.,"A very good movie. No matter what some critics may say, J-Lo has a presence on screen. She gives a great performance and helps women believe that they don't have to take abuse of those types. Plus she is beautiful. While this film may not win any major awards, it makes you feel the sorrow and pain of a helpless, abused mother with child, then cheer when she beats her abuser down. Just a feel good movie in my opinion. A pretty damn good flic."
3,J Lo always like that,"I have to say, all of J Lo's movies are the same.But this one is really like Steven Seagal's film."
5,Enough,Great movie. I used it in my Family and Consumer Sciences class to discuss domestic violence and the violence cycle. Students were interested because it was modern and it contained segments that could be used as clear examples of the cycle.
2,it's all a horrible mistake,"My parents rented this dvd, and told me it actually was pretty good (though you'd think by now I would have learned my lesson about trusting their judgement on film), so I figured I'd check it out. That was a horrible mistake. Somebody casted Jennifer Lopez as the lead role. That was a horrible mistake. I suppose I should have kept in mind that Nicholas Kazan, writer of Bicentennial Man wrote the script, both of which were horrible mistakes. Three great actors, Juliette Lewis, Dan Futterman and Bill Cobbs were in this film--a horrible mistake on their part. And while this wasn't the best movie for Noah Wylie to take a part in, he did a wonderful job. He played a villainous role, one that is so unlike what he usually plays, and he did it well. Very creepy. Not a horrible mistake to take a role, just a horrible mistake that the role was in this movie. It's predictable and the only outstanding thing about this film is that it is, you guessed it, all a horrible mistake."
1,"yes,''ENOUGH'' already !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","j lo,youve got more money than youll ever be able to spend......CAN YOU PLEASE GO AWAY ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? your acting is almost as horrible as your ''singing'' !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! how many flops and raspberries do you intend on being apart of ?!?!?!?!?!? if not for us innocent bystanders,for yourself....STOP,LEAVE!"
2,What happens when good talent meets bad script,"Jennifer Lopez is much better an actress than singer, but ""Enough"" is not a showcase for her. Following a formulatic, but tolerable rising action, the film quickly falls apart when Lopez's character goes on the run with her daughter from her abusive husband. Plot holes and quickly executed fragments of the story ruin an otherwise predictable but entertaining film.While the point of the film is a woman's power to protect herself and her children, the film seems to just be gearing towards the mass of girl power films of the last few years. Nothing original or engaging happens in ""Enough"" and the finale sequence is pretty laughable.Despite a decent performance out of Lopez, she can't save a mediocore plot with minor potential from going anywhere but below average."
5,ARE U CRAZY I LOVED THIS MOVIE,"I don't see why everybody is giving this bad reviews. Responding to another reviewer, she stayed with Mitch because she was scared, not because she was stupid!!! Did you listen to what he said to her??!! But, she finally got the courage to leave (with help from friends). I love this movie. J. Lo is a wonderful actress, and everybody did a good job in this movie. The only thing I didn't like is seeing Mitch's mother act like she was blaming Slim after she got hit. Oh and I didn't like seeing poor Gracie go through this. She's so cute!!!! I know it's just acting but this movie makes you stop what you're doing and pay attention.This movie was great. I hope to see more from J. Lo."
2,Enough of J-Lo's acting,"Considering how this was advertised as a serious role-it failed to measure up. I guess J-Lo's paycheck was so big- there was not enough money to pay a decent writer.So all abused women should take Karate and learn to fight back! Hmmm this is an interesting concept. TOO bad this sound message did not come across due to the insanity of the script, and the crappy dialougeGive up acting J-Lo and focus on your other talents."
2,Contrived,"""Enough"" is nothing more than a Lifetime original movie masquerading as a big screen drama. Instead of exploring the complicated and tragic dynamics behind an abusive marriage, ""Enough"" simply creates a cartoonishly evil villian and a damsel in distress for the audience to root for. Charismatic Jennifer Lopez, talented Juliette Lewis, and dashing Billy Campbell all deserve better material."
5,Great Performance fron Jennifer Lopez,"I went and saw this movie the day it came out and it was a wonderful movie. Jennifer Lopez gave a great performance as Slim, and Tessa Allen was really cute as her daughter Gracie. The story was kind of predictable, but it was suspenseful, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat with the music and all of the shadow images around the corners. I would definitely recommend seeing and buying this movie for anyone who either likes Jennifer or enjoys thrillers. Even though you can predict what's going to happen at the end, it's still worth seeing."
3,"Good for conversation, weak on grammar","The focus is the spoken language, and it is effective. However, some of the instructions for the exercises (in Italian) are not very clear, and the grammar explanations (in English) are not adequate. (I purchased a concise grammar text to supplement this book.)I like their casual approach to introducing new material (grammar & vocabulary) - new usages just pop into the dialogues and exercises occasionally in situations where the context helps clarify the usage. Soon after, the formal explanations are provided to help generalize. The approach helps prepare for real-life use of the language, in which a lot of new vocabulary and usage crops up."
2,One of the poorest textbooks I've used.,"This is by far and away the WORST textbook I've ever had the misfortune of using. I'm a college graduate and have taken many graduate courses, so I've seen my share of textbooks.Very, very poorly written."
5,This disc does not leave my cd changer,"WOW - I have hundreds of cds and this almost instantly became my favorite. No matter what type of music you listen to, there is something here for everyone. The variety of styles all blend together perfectly for a front to back listen."
5,One that I give away...,"It is almost impossible to know if others will like a tune when they hear it for the first time. Consequently, choosing music to give as a gift is often a waste of time and money to both parties. This is one of the CD's which I believe should be given anyway. Aside from a variety of styles making this CD a delight to listen to, the stories , though sometimes a bit dark, are intruiging as well.Give one to a friend at be surprised at what they like about it..."
3,"OK, but not enteric-coated. I recommend Solaray brand instead","This Mucuna supplement definitely works, however, it comes in non-enteric-coated capsules. Therefore it should to be taken on an empty stomach and you should avoid eating too much protein for several hours before and after because protein digestive enzymes can affect the uptake and breakdown L-Dopa. That means the effective dose is lower and you need up to 3 per day.While this brand works fine, I recommend the ""DopaBean"" brand sold by solaray instead. It comes in enteric-coated capsules and you get a better effective dose by only taking 1 or 2 per day instead of 3 and you don't have to worry as much about about when or what you ate last."
3,Beginner Level Kickboxing,"This is strictly a beginner kickboxing workout. It is fun, and has great motivating music. Especially when you put it through your stereo speakers using the DVD. Amy Acuff looks a bit lost and uninspired here, and the instructor Allan is unpeasantly condescending to her. He is a good instructor, and if I were to guess, I would say he is upset that she gets higher billing than him. And, maybe rightly so, but unprofessional of him nonetheless. The workout is easy to follow, and will get you sweating if you put some effort into it. This really is a fun workout, but I have a hard time dealing with his attitude, and it detracts from the whole workout for me. Probably, the workout itself deserves 5 stars for beginners, 4 stars for people who are a bit beyond that, but it lost a star or two for the reasons mentioned."
3,Good workout,I think it is a interesting way to exercise not like a traditional aeobic. The music is modern and the instructor is quite good but Amy is not a main role in this DVD.
1,Not worth your money.,"I bought this DVD because I thought that MTV could put together a fun and exilarating workout video. But the moves are complicated/awkward and they are hard to follow. They don't give you much time to figure them out. And, you are always doing the reverse of everyone. One thing that was aggrevating was when they change a scene, you are expected to keep moving, but the music changes or dissapears for a few seconds. And sometimes, people in the video move offbeat. The editing is horrible. The camera doesn't stay focused on one ""good"" person. The guest is flimsy and can't do the moves accurately. She doesn't even look like she's trying. Overall it's a horrible DVD. Don't waste your money."
4,Good for beginners,"In a sea of excercise videos, I thought this one looked appealing - I have to admit I was swayed by the music though!! I am a former dancer and I was surprised by how confused I was trying to follow the instructor. However, by the end of the video, I was sweating and feeling pretty good that I got through most of the routine without kicking myself! Fun and fairly quick, I would recommend to those who haven't worked out in awhile and want something new to add to their old collection."
4,My first work out tape,"I wanted to be a little more active without having to go and sign up for an aerobics class... Went out and started looking for a fun work out video. What caught my eye about this video was the soundtrack. Which includes Basement Jaxx and Groove Armada. The other reviews were right about Amy having absolutely no clue what's going on. It's hilarious, during the workout you start doing upper-cuts and she says, ""Who are YOU thinking of when you're doing this?"" The host says, ""Oh, I don't think I should I say..."" You giggle to yourself because you might have a pretty good idea who he is thinking of... Good workout however, I can't seem to get my heart rate to the advanced rate. This was an awesome first video."
3,A fun routine to have in your workout rotation,"This is only the second workout video I've ever bought, and I was expecting it to be a lot more difficult than it was. This is really a beginner level video as far as fitness goes, but maybe intermediate as far as the difficulty of the moves. The instructor is low key and not annoying, and the music is great. The moves themselves aren't hard to learn and are demonstrated in an easy to follow fashion, aside from the reversed cueing - but once you learn the routine you just remember to switch sides and more or less ignore the instructor save for the counts.It got me into my target heart rate zone for 15-20 minutes without boring me to pieces, and had a nice warmup and cooldown. I will likely go elsewhere when I get in better shape and this ceases to be any challenge at all."
4,fun in many ways,"Well, I saw this video tape in the store and figured, what the heck, Amy Acuff is an Olympic high jumper so they've got to have something good here. Little did I know the workout was actually being led by another person, a guy with a very long name, and an attitude as well. Amy makes comments throughout the video and he always responds with an attitude. It doesn't make a difference, because the workout is fun and gets you motivated. I've used it for two weeks now, and I swear, I already have results. The workout is easy to learn after a few times and it gets you going. I'd go for it, and hey, you get a laugh at the uncoordinated Amy Acuff and the dramatic back up dancers!!"
2,Doesn't kick ...at all,"This video has only made it into my DVD player once, and I had a difficult time not getting up and turning it off. I bought this video thinking that, true to MTV form, it would be a fun, energizing opportunity to get in a good workout. Unfortunately, I BARELY got a workout and didn't even feel that it offered much in the form of entertainment value (as is typically the case with MTV productions). If you are JUST starting out with exercise (or, specifically, kick boxing) than this video might be a viable option... However, if you're a ""seasoned"" athlete, or if you are looking for a heart-pumping challenge, I would definitely recommend looking elsewhere. You won't get a kick ... workout here."
2,Not Worth It. See The Films It Uses Instead.,"I got this around the same time I picked up the film based on this CD ROM thing.It was neat to see all the little clips from the different films I have grown up with and loved. As a b-movie afficianado I figured I should get this.I was wrong. The movie shows the exact same clips mainly and it is a lot less hassle. You can never make a descent movie with these clips.It was nice to see some of my fave scenes on my computer, but overall for the few times I have tried to use this thing (apart from just showing my friends the neat clips) it wasn't worth it."
2,"Fun For An Hour, But Useless After That.","This CD Rom was already a little dated when i initially picked it up, but I was really interested in seeing that this is about, that...plus I love the movies the clips on this CD are from.I must have played around with it for just a couple of hours until I finally realized, sure it was cool to initially look at all the clips on the CD, but you can never make a semi intelligible movie out of this.Filed on my shelf under 'stupid things I bought out of curiosity'.I also bought the actual movie they made based on this CD ROM (can you beleive it? They made a movie out of this and I bought it!). You will be wishing you could make something even close to the movie, even though the movie isn't really any good either!"
1,Same old Nashville,"I purchased Whatever Comes First in hopes of discovering a new folk/country/ original band. Instead it was more of the Nashville music machine. Each song is exactly like the last with each one over produced and written with the same themes, lost love , whiskey, the road, etc. The biggest weakness of the album is the song writing. The members of the band can play but they are given little to work with. The melodies are flat and unoriginal. It would of been interesting perhaps to see this band cover some other artist songs to see what they have. There is not one moment of grit in this album.Pas the syrup."
1,Since when is Fresno Southern California?,"I bought this book because I thought it would be a good reference for those that like to camp in southern california...but as soon as I opened the book I found that most of the campgrounds reviewed are not even in southern california, most are north of Bakersfield. If you live in this town, this would be a great book, but for those of you that live in LA, skip it."
5,Better Than The Rest,Have used this product for years and most adult males I know have asked me about it wanting the same for themselves. Young and old females love the fragrance.
1,The 8 oz Bottle is a completely different product in both color and odor...... Not fragrance... very unpleasant odor,"This is the 8 oz bottle that is completely unsatisfactory.... It is obviously a different product than what is in the 2 oz bottle.... It is a very dark, dark Blue instead of a light blue and has an extemely unpleasent odor.... How do we go about returning it for a refund? My husband has been using Royal Copenhagen for years and this is the first and only time it has been bad."
4,Old style scent,It's ok but scent from old time. Maybe not for young people. But smells fine and it's good aftershave lotion.
5,Favorite Aftershave,"I had a considerably smaller bottle that I had gotten for Christmas one year and had lasted me a while. I liked everything about it--the smell, the feel. Though it seemed at first like it would dry my skin out, it didn't, and it wasn't greasy or oily like an ""aftershave balm."" I like it a lot. And for the price Amazon had for 8 ounces, it was quite a steal. The small bottle lasted me a while; I'm sure I'll be set through next year with this one."
4,"Very good, wish it had been trimmed a little",I enjoyed this book and learned from it. This may be because I am very interested in cognitive psychology. This book provides a new twist in that area with a Buddhist point of view. My only complaint about this book is that (in my opinion) the material could have been presented more effectively if a third of the book was trimmed.
4,A Helpful Book,"This book was recommended to be at a time when I was going through some personal difficulties and it it was able to teach me to be mindful of all the powerful emotions I was going through, and to hold on to them long enough to turn strong emotions into insights, and insights into solutions.What the book needs though is a re-edit. I always appreciate material written with an economy of words better. Nonetheless, this one's worth buying, and keeping."
3,Nothing new,"I agree with much of what I found in this book, although nothing in it was new to me. I'm sorry to say the hype around this book is more impressive than the book itself. Anything that can manage to get the Dalai Lama's name attached to it these days seems to be an instant hit no matter what the actual content or quality.On the bright side, however, the same day I bought this book I also discovered a little gem called ""Open Your Mind, Open Your Life: A Little Book of Eastern Wisdom"" by Taro Gold. To my surprise and delight, I actually found more unique and refreshing thoughts in ""Open Your Mind, Open Your Life."""
4,Score one for Buddha!,"This book did a nice job of integrating Buddhist thought with modern psychology -- which is getting more Buddhist all the time! The writing was beautiful. Only trouble is, I always reach for books like this when I feel I need help, can't do it alone, etc., and feel absolutely inadeqaute to the rigours of the self-help processes recommended. I would recommend this book more for practitioners than for those of us limping along. Meanwhile, I will try to simply ""chop wood, carry water."""
3,Nothing new,"I agree with much of what I found in this book, although nothing in it was new to me. I'm sorry to say the hype around this book is more impressive than the book itself. Anything that can manage to get the Dalai Lama's name attached to it seems to be an instant hit no matter what the actual content or quality."
4,food for thought for professionals,"Very valuable information but not usersfriendly as a self help.The simple wisdom of mindfulness is not presented in an easy way.As a self help you need a lot of persistance to go through the whole book.Therefore it deserves only 3 stars.If yo read it as a professional it deserves 5 stars. A lot of scientific findings are presented . Also some interesting new ideas s on combining cognitive therapy and mindfulness are presented. A word of caution however...the essence of mindfulness is to find peace with whatever is...this means you re OK, with your thoughts and no thoughts need to be transformed; it s about finding peace with negative thoughts and at the same time being open to the reality of positive thoughts...allowing both to be there at the same time and acknowledging this reality of duality ( same for emotions).This fundamental mindfulness idea is not always being respected in the proposed exercices."
3,??? need help with this one...,"Mine don't make any noise either. The posts are really stiff and there isn't any room between the bells to allow them to move and strike each other. Guess I'll try pulling them apart a little too, like the another reviewer did...maybe if I gently bend them apart they'll work like I expected???????"
5,garden bells,I bought this for my daughter for her birthday. I is exactly what she wanted for a long time and we could not find one in the stores. She loves it.
3,No music yet,I'm not sure if it has to be worn/broke in or what. It hasn't chimmed since I got it. Doesn't matter if I spray it with water while watering the flowers or if they get water while it's raining. Won't purchase another one until I see when/if this one will chime.
1,Four years w/o a sound,"I have really wondered what the point was. I was given this as a gift, it said it was a wind chime. I sat it out on the deck railing where we get a fairly steady breeze throughout the year yet have never heard a single note out of it. The tines holding up the bells are just too stiff. It would take a hurricane to bang them together.Now I read from one of the other reviewers that it's supposed to sit out in the garden and collect rain! I'll try it, because I was about ready to junk it. Hope it works. Would have been nice if some directions to that effect had come with it.I'm giving it 3 stars only because I'm holding out hope the rain routine works. ..otherwise it would be a 1.UPDATE: 5 yrs now. Given up ever hoping to hear it, bumping the stars down to 1. I'd trash it, but. . . it's a gift. I'll let the Lantana grow over it."
3,HORRIBLE,(...) I went to my next doors families house and their daughter (...) had one an it was horrible the water went everywhere if you touched the house it would fall of water so do not buy this toy because if you do you will have a watery house and I hope this review helps you
4,Very Cute...,I bought this for my 7 yr old daughter for Christmas and she loves it!! Although her's did not come with the stove or the popcorn machine shown? hmm..well anyways she played for hours. Only let down was that the tiki lights keep falling down and the doors come off easily. For the price they could have been secured better. But my lil girl loves it!!
4,TOO CUTE!,This toy is so cute! I loved it and I'm a teen.There a few small pieces that are very easy to lose so you have to be careful with that.And small kids should be watched while playing with this toy since they could pop one of the smallpieces in to their mouths.I thought the house should have been a little more bigger.I hated having to waste almost 30 dollars on such a small house with only one doll! It did get boring after a few hours....the best thing to do is buy this cute toy when it's on sale so you won't have to waste some much money.Other then that it's a cute toy.
1,If I could give it zero stars I would... HORRIBLE,"My daughter received this toy as a gift..It was missing parts, it leaks water and the doors keep falling off! Do not waste your time money or the disappointment of your child. My 5 year old was so looking forward to receiving this toy and you can imagine her disappointment when I had to return it to the store. Based on other reviews I will not be purchasing another for her."
2,Water Leaks,I bought this toy for my 3 year old for christmas and she does love it; however you would think they would construct a water toy a little better because after being knocked over the water leaked from everywhere. I would not recommend filling this toy with water.
4,My first yoga experience,"I found the tape loaded with more commercials than actual yoga time, however, the yoga introduction is very good for a beginner. I found myself wanting to do it the next day and that's always a good thing. It is easy and adjustable for anyone, no matter what shape your in. Its definitely a beginner tape though."
4,vinyasa is my favorite part,"Rodney Yee has a very mellow voice and approach to timing that I really like. I enjoy using the 15 minutes of vinyasa warmup found at the beginning of the tape pretty regularly. I find the rest of the tape pleasantly challenging, increasing in difficulty as you go along, which is also good. I always fast forward through that gratuitous ""dance"" that he does at the beginning, and think it's a waste of tape when you want to use the tape more than once."
4,good workout but not for anyone brand new,i loved this tape. some of the positions he got into i had to laugh at. like i could really put my head to the floor while i had my legs crossed in front of me. got real. maybe in a few months. the whole thing took only about 20 min. i didn't expect it to go so fast.
5,It's been the best thing for my back...,"Doctors and tests couldn't figure out what was causing my lower back pain....my physical therapist wasn't making much progress...and I finally bought this tape. It has provided the most relief of ANYTHING I've tried. Who would believe that a beginning, gentle Yoga tape could give me so much relief. I'm a real believer now. It wasn't long til my back felt well enough to try the Power Yoga tape. This Back Care Yoga has really helped me pay attention to posture, and has helped get me in the habit of extending my body instead of slumping. Highly recommend."
4,Very good simple workout.,"I like this video. It gives the back and neck a good gentle workout. I have been taking yoga classes for some time and have a few of Rodney Yee's tapes. He has a quiet, soothing manner and the scenery is lovely. The only problem that I have with this and some of his other videos are that sometimes when he is coaching the viewer's breathing, he neglects to follow through. Several times you are left with the command to breathe in, but no command to exhale is given before the next breathe-in command...Aside from that, it is restful and beneficial for your back."
1,"Can't review it, because I can't seem to get it","I've been waiting 2 months for this item, but it never seems to come off of backorder. I recommend trying another item."
2,Not for Beginners!,"I have chronic back pain which I'm being treated for by my physical therapist. I brought in this video for her to review before I tried it. She said that the yoga moves are great, but they are way too advanced for someone suffering with chronic pain. Some of the moves could actually cause more harm. These moves are meant for advanced yoga sessions, not beginners with chronic pain. Just wanted to share the info."
2,"Too many props, too easy","I have several of Rodney Yee's videos and really enjoy them, but I don't like this one much at all. Most of the exercises are done on a chair, which I suppose would be good in an office environment. For lower back development, I'd recommend the Yoga for strength, which goes a lot farther to help develop your back and stomach to avoid pain in the future. however, i guess if you have a weight problem and have a good chair, this would be a good video."
3,Average,A Good beat but this song is to dreary and somewhat scary because it sounds like thunderstorms.Lyrics 5/10 Production 8/10 Overall 6.5/10
4,"Suvin, Darko's Russian Science Fiction",Suvin Darko is from former Yugoslavia. The book supercedes the 1971 Russian Science Fiction Literature and Criticism. It may be more comprehensive than Liapunov's fantastiki. Certianly it is very useful for those who don't read Cyrillic through its use of Library of Congress transliteration. An appendix covers pre 1956 Russian SF.
1,what a mistake it was buying this cd.,"Well, in a world where i am unable to listen to everything that i usually end up purchasing. This was one of those cd's that i really wish i had had the opportunity to check out first. Of course the cover art is unbelievable, but the 5 photos of the band spread throught the cd inlay book; much like the plague...are a bit self-centered and not needed. As for the cd itself and how it sounded....picture a watered down slayer fronted by a bad bruce dickinson every friday night karaoke impersonator and you will have hades. And believe me, when i listened to this cd i thought i was in hades. Try to avoid this one...pick up some real thrash not these copycat imposters."
1,Save your money,"This is a waste of money. It was not done professionally, you can see people crossing in front of the camera and talking in the back ground. It is not worth the price, it should be for $1.00. Done very poorly."
4,Good Book ( On foreign policy),"well, I just finished reading another smart and fascinating book by Tom Friedman on foreign affairs. He does a fair an accurate job deceifering the event taking place in the Middle East. More than a few of the theories I had already heard yet it was interesting to recap. But, when he comments on political going-ons in America you see a hate for the administration and dashes of liberalism. Hey, if I wanted a liberal book I would have bought Micheal Moore's new one. Mr. Friedman your overseas analysis is objective, but stay away from domestic policy, your just too one sided."
2,A little too disjointed,"When I bought this book, I didn't realize it was mostly just a consolidated writing of Friedman's collumns in the Times. I think Friedman is a great author with lots of great insights, but he isn't able to go into his ideas in depth as much as I would have liked in a bunch of detached 750-1000 word segments. Since the sections are arranged chronologically, there also isn't the opportunity to tie the themes together.If you really like Friedman, then it's worth a read, but if you are in it for just one, I'd read The Lexus and the Olive Tree first. It is by far his best."
3,Interesting but predictable,"There are some interesting opinion pieces in this book, but overall it's predictable op ed stuff"
5,"Simply Amazing, Must Read","I first came across this book and Mr Friedman channel surfing one night. I found a show on the Discovery Channel about Friedman's, basicly it was him traveling arounf the Islamic world interviewing world leaders, scholars, students, and your average citizens. A few days later I bought this book and did not put it down until i was finished. He provides a very insightful analysis about current Mid-East society and politics, the factors that led to the September 11 attacks and the current war on terrorism, and the failure of moderization in the Islamic world. Anyone remotly interested in politics should read this book, and Friedman's column in the NY Times"
4,"Good columns, but skip if you've read them...","Tom Friedman is one of the most astute observers of the middle East crisis working today. He is essential reading for anyone hoping make sense of the relationship between Islam and the West.That said, if you are a regular reader of Friedman's New York Times columns, you can skip this book - you've read it before. Yes, he includes his diary, which tells of his travels and contacts post 9/11. However the most interesting parts of these experiences made it into the columns! So there is really not much that is both new and worthwhile."
4,A Collection of Wisdom,"Superbly written and thought out, as always with Tom Friedman.I was just disappointed to find it a collection of editorials rather than a nice, long non-fiction book like ""From Beirut......""."
1,"Everyone is good, and everyone is bad...","in more or less equal measure. That's how the liberal sees everything. Only sincewe - the US and Israel - are supposed to be evolved societies, we are more bad and less good. The Arabs are expected to be bad, so when they do anything less bad, Friedman thinks they are good. You can read this stuff from every columnist every day in the NY Times.An early paragraph captures Friedman perfectly: He wants the US to kick the crap out of Afghanistan for 9/11 without hurting the good people there. How do we tell them apart? What if the bad Afghani is hiding behind the good one?? Everything sounds good but isn't realistic - the mind of the liberal.I like Friedman's writing style so I've read all his books, but I loathe the holier and smarter than thou attitude that pervades all his books."
4,The Friedman Files,"If you only want to read one contemporary account of the aftermath of September 11, this is an excellent book. By including all of the editorials Friedman about the event and the people, cultures, and religions which were affected by the disaster, it allows him to show the changing current of thoughts and emotions around the world. Friedman of course writes very well and his articles are thought provoking, which I appreciate even though I don't always agree with him, but the bst parts of this book is he explores not only the American reaction to the terrorist attacks, but those in the Middle East and Europe. It provides a much broader picture of the events than I have found else where and adds a great deal to my knowledge of the current international situation. I liked this book a great deal and would highly recommend it to people interested in world affairs, history, religion, or just like good nonfiction."
3,"If you are familiar with TF, no need to read this","Let me say first that I love Tom Friedman's columns and books. I think he is the most objective analyst on the Middle East and its issues that's available to the lay person.However, if one is familiar and a fan of Friedman's, I don't think this book will shed that much light on its subject. Although TF's stories are each different, if one reads enough of them, one can see the overall messages. So, for me, to read column after column in book form was a bit much. Perhaps I just went about it the wrong way by trying to read 30-40 pages a day. Maybe the best way to read this book is to read 2-3 stories a day...but I was too impatient for that.The diary format of the last 70 pages or so was far more readable for me.Again, I have very very few disagreements with his opinions and I think the person who has not been exposed to TF's work and wants to get a good grip on the situation in the Middle East will get a lot out of this book."
1,Read Prestowitz'z Book Instead,"Instead of reading Friedman's book, read Clyde Prestowitz's book, _Rogue Nation: American Unilateralism and the Failure of Good Intentions_. Friedman is an unrepented supporter of the preventive war on Iraq. For a review of Prestowitz's book, go to the web site of the New York Review of Books, page http://www.nybooks.com/articles/16591 ."
1,Disappointing - I expected More from Thomas Friedman,"I expected more from Thomas Friedman, especially after Lexus and the Olive Tree. This book is a MONEY GRAB - plain and simple. there is nothing in this book but WORD-FOR-WORD reprints of his NY TImes columns over the past year. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY. My copy is for sales if someone wants it."
5,looks so good,it looks so good i know allready im gunna love this movie :) buy it people it looks hella good
2,Rent first...,"Im glad I did! It Wasn't really a horrible way to kill time, but the acting was just atrocious and that was kinda hard to sit through. There were a few creepy parts involving the ""eye"" girl, but there really was not a whole lot of explanation for what the hell was going on. I love a good independant horror flick as much as the next guy, but this was pretty bad. Rent first before you decide to make your purchase."
1,Should be listed as a comedy,"Plague Town looked like it had a good premise but really failed to deliver. The story follows a family that is visiting Ireland and misses their tour bus by seconds (don't bus drivers use their side mirrors). This leads to the family fighting for the next half of the movie with forced acting by all. The two sisters fight the most going so far as to dropping the C word bomb! Basically we laughed through the whole thing, especially while watching how effective a plastic hubcap can actually be used as a murder weapon (who knew????) I would say if you really wanted to see this movie rent it first, I'm sure you will thank me for saving you $15 bucks"
1,ugh,"super boring. no fun, no suspense. watch an argento film instead. watch the freaking muppets. i was super psyched to see this and now can only think of all the lovely things i couldve bought with the ten bucks i spent on this schlock."
1,Avoid This...Like the Plague,"Great Gertie's Nightgown! What in the world was THIS all about? I'm given a cast of characters who are so full of loathing you can't stand a single one: Two sisters that constantly b*tch at one another; a milquetoast step mom, a father who needed to be slapped until someone's arms got tired, and a ""local"" who is simply there for ""boinky-boinky"" purposes. Lord, this was like attending a family reunion. The viewer is never told why all these children are cursed...with bad makeup...and why--after being stabbed with a piece of broken glass by one of the local darlings--the father didn't have sense enough to just get the hell out of Dodge. Let's just say this amounted to 85 minutes of my life that I'll never get back. And, as one previous reviewer pointed out, I'm glad I rented this before I decided to buy it. BIG change of heart there..."
5,one of ther best horror movie,"plague is very creepy and scary , i saw this movie in the dark at 11.00pm at first its like you dont know what my happen but later it jumps at you thats were the horror begins, i cant tell u but the covers freaky its true u dont whant to see this things in the dark outside if you were alone. also see this good films i got in blue- ray at amazon.com signs, the thing, 30 days of night, the grudge, messengers, in order to get scared you need a surrund sound system. so you can hear every horror sound in your living room"
2,Doesn't live up to its potential,"Taking the horror genre to Ireland for a change, I was looking forward to seeing what they had done with Plague Town. The answer was ""not much"" - aside from some effective imagery (the few scenes with the blindfold girl were well done) the film plays out like a re-hashing of any of the recent ""torture porn"" films, such as The Hills Have Eyes or Wolf Creek. The acting on some cases is bad, even by low-budget standards.Sadly, with all that Ireland has to offer a horror film - from gorgeous lanscapes to castle settings - the producers of this film gave us just another cottage in the woods, and some people who are so hard to like, you don't care by the time they die."
1,Plaque Town,"First, if you're expecting a terrifying, grab your chair, scream out loud horror film with a plot, good script, good acting or anything else good- DON'T WATCH OR BUY THIS POS! This just might be the worst horror film or any film I've ever seen. The story was written by a child, the so called actors couldn't get a job doing dinner theater, the special FX were weak and low budget to say the least and the direction was non-existant!!! The only redeeming qualities of the movie, and this is by a long stretch, are the shooting locations and scenery. It was set in Ireland but was shot in Connecticut and the locations are the only saving grace in this film. At least the DP shot great scenery and captured the beauty of Ireland.I would rate this film a 1/2 star on a 5 star scale. VERY BAD!!!!!!"
1,Complete and utter garbage Dont waste your time or money!,Complete and utter garbage Dont waste your time or money!Says it all for me but have to use 20 words in review.Probably the worst film with some of the most lame special effects I have ever seen I could not believe it was made so recently.I know everyone is different but surely anyone giving this more than the one star that is the lowest possible rating must need some kind of psychiatric help...........I watched it for free on sky and still felt I'd been ripped off!As another reviewer pointed out it's ninety ish minutes of my life I will never get back..........I have never felt driven to review anything before but if I can prevent even one person from wasting a portion of their life watching this drivel my own sacrifice will at least not have been in vain.
3,like being only a little bit pregnant,"As it starts out, I liked it and it had that creepy HP Lovecraft shadow over Insmouth sort of thing going - then runs right into a brick wall and ends. I was like...huh?....feeling like I was engaged in a long engrossing phone call, and my cell phone just lost service-blap! Where's my closure?! I was really honked off - things were good and then-BLAP. That suks, and that's sad, because this would have been a really good creepy film if the end - had a real end to work with. Rent- don't buy - unless you like the tease with no pay off."
1,dumbfounded,That is the only word that comes to my mind when I think of WHY DID I BUY THIS MOVIE. Do yourself a favor and save that $10 for gas money.(I tried to get away with not rating it..because it sucks that bad..but I have to rate it or it won't post. So to whomever reads my review I'd like to officially rate this movie a 0.)

3,Academic readers only,"As an avid naval strategy reader, I had much anticipated this work's release. However, after finishing it, I was mildly disappointed, as Cable sets overly rigorous standards in defining the allowable circumstances for true political impacts by naval events. For this reason it is often smaller naval incidents which are discussed, rather than most major naval actions.Also, Cable virtually eliminates all ancient naval actions from consideration, as he views ancient naval activity as being ultimately dependent upon land-based military technology (such as the Roman corvus); this is due to the lack of true naval clash in the modern big-gun ship sense (characteristic only of the last few centuries).This is not a bad book, but it will definitely appeal mainly to more academic types interested in squeezing analysis out of small, tightly-defined historical circumstances."
5,A/V Cables,"The perfect cable for my application. Great quality, great price, great service and they send a nice catalogue of their products for future needs."
2,Poor video quality...,"I ordered this cable to use it with my laptop and send the video signal to a Full-HD LCD through a receiver that supports 1080p up-scaling. The cable shows a good manufactoring process, but s-video quality and resolution is very poor. A VGA cable does a better work, and it doesn't need up-scaling."
1,don't loose your money,The really expensive little book lacks coherence and it is difficult to follow due to the full of citations and data piled up and left as row material page after page.
4,The birth of UNIX from an insider,"A lively and impeccably well informed history of the birth of UNIX. It's not perfect, but it's still the best source around."
3,Somewhat Haphazard History,"I had higher expectations from this book. I thought it would be a well-organized or chronological history, but it's more just a bunch of interviews with people who he could contact (not all the important people of Unix). The treatment jumps around with no clear organization. It's definitely for Unix ""insiders"" who will already know some history. Most of his info is available from other sources anyway. Peter Salus wants to appear to be an expert in Unix history, but he is really an enthusiast who took the time to write some things up. Definitely interesting reading still, all in one book, but don't expect a complete treatment.Also, for a history book, half the photos have no dates, and there are pictures of people who are not even mentioned in the text (eg, Evi Nemeth). Some figures have no caption or attribution (eg, UNIX VERSION TREE)."
1,"silly, silly, silly","This is the first Fforde book and the last I will read. It was not only silly and predictable, but sexist. The characters were cartoonish and none likable. I see where Fforde has written 10 books. Oh my! This one will be returned directly to my public library."
3,A typical Fforde story,"When I buy a Katie Fforde novel I know what I'm signing up for. A jolly good read with a bit of romance, some female bonding, a critique of masculinity, and a diplomatic treatment on women's issues in our daily lives. The names change as do the settings and careers, but the basic storyline is pure Fforde. If it aint broke don't fix it."
2,Painful,"This was a light read-a very light read. It could have been condensed by over a hudred pages due to the contrived and derivative plot and character interactions. THe character development and plot were predictable, contrived and very basic. The plot and character interaction was very contrived and derivative. The plot did not go anywhere. I found myself not caring about the characters and frankly being very irritated by them. I found myself wanting to put the book down multiple times but just skimmed through the meaningless character dialogue."
3,"Plods Along, Predictable","Restoring Grace is a light--very light--book that is both completely predictable and slugs along. The book moves at a snail's pace, with dialogue that is boring and redundant. None of the characters are believable--they are either all good or rotten. I did manage to read through it, however--fluffy summer reading."
1,Description does not match item,"Buyer beware, this is a youth hat. It's tight on my 6 year old. The label on the hat states youth, but no where on the description does it state that. The description states that if you are a player or a coach and your team needs to have the ""pro team"" look that this is the hat for you. There is no way this hat would fit any coach, and the only player it would fit is a 4 or 5 year old playing t-ball. Very disappointed, as this was supposed to be part of a birthday present for my 12 year-old son. Aside from the misleading description, the hat itself is very nice and would be great if you have a little Ranger fan in your house."
2,"twice tried, twice failed","to finish reading this book! I was totally psyched to read it, because I thought it was such an interesting perspective on the Arthurian legends, but it turned out to be vague and boring. the only current I could even remotely follow was the romance-novelish style of writing, which didn't appeal to me in the least."
4,The ancient demon leyends and myths come to anime,"A story of suspense, and, terror. It is a well developed script, no spoilers, and, best of all, it is based on the ancient leyends and myths of Japan, where demons used to have a very important role in people's everyday life. The continuity of the scenes, and, story, is well done. It keeps the audience attention every second of the film. However, if you know nothing of the demons theme, it might get a little confusing and maybe boring. It's ... a very well developed script, and, has very good drawing and sequence of it too. If you have vol.1 you have to have vol.2."
2,A little disappointed,"We ordered this toy box because we love the Phillies and wanted our little boy to have a fun place to store his toys. However, the bottom piece of wood for the toy box isn't cut correctly so the sides cannot be attached properly unless my husband cuts the wood so it fits. It was supposed to be an easy assembly but now he has to play wood shop teacher to make the toy box assemble properly. Very frustrating."
2,Good if you don't mind it falling apart,"This toy chest is cute, but not sturdy. It never held together well until we used wood glue to glue the thing together. Any time it was bumped it required re-tightening. We bought the chest to store larger toys for our twin boys. After a year of use, the lid hinge broke off when the boys tried to close the chest when there was a toy sticking up too high. My boys are only 2 1/2 and not destructive, yet they managed to break the lid off this chest. I would recommend the chest to someone who was looking for something that looked nice but did not intend to use it."
5,Great Product,I have been plagued with candida and rosacea for years. A couple of these before bed helps tremendously. It feels very gentle -- must be the enteric coating paired w the simplicity of the ingredients. Amazon has better price than my local health food stores.
5,W.I.T.C.H,W.I.T.C.H. Graphic Novel: The Power of Friendship - Book #1 was one of my favorite book when I was an adolescent. I'm considering buying the others in the series...
5,Appreciated beyond the target audience,"My son is 4 1/2 and has just discovered graphic novels, starting with W.I.T.C.H., book 2. We're on to book 1 and ready to start looking for #3 and beyond. He loves these books, surprisingly to me, and I love them as well. He's been watching Studio Gibli movies since he was little, so it makes sense to me that he would like the manga style. Now, we just have to get our library to stock all of the series!"
5,Very insightful and truly life-changing (and life-saving),"Ferrell does an outstanding job on many levels in this book, yet all angles are about the Atonement of Christ and how to apply it in our lives. First of all, he engages in some very insightful and inspiring scriptural interpretation and gleans life-changing principles (truths about the Atonement) from some unexpected sources -- stories that are often overlooked. Second, he presents them in a framework that is personable to just about anyone and helps the reader to empathize with the characters and their predicament. And third, Ferrell challenges the reader to experience learning of the principles for himself or herself and thus to internalize these principles and become a better person through Christ. I could not recommend too many books more than this one."
5,Outstanding Insight.,"If we could all learn to put away our proverbial swords, towards our neighbors, work asscociates, political apponets, obnoxious drivers, lousy customer service personal, etc... what a better world we would live in. Perhaps this is the ultimate answer to world peace. Could it be that simple?Awesome book! I have bought 10 copies and given them out to closest friends. Even if your personal relations are perfect, get this book, truly amazing."
5,profoundly inspiring,One of the most thought provoking books I have ever read. It's one that changes the way you think and act. It gave me a perspective of the Saviors atonement that I won't forget.It's very difficult to hold on to anger after you read this book. A must read if you ask me !
5,"An amazing, life-changing book","This is an extraordinary book. The insights and impact are simply amazing. I don't think I've ever been affected by a book the way I have been by this one. I'll never see life, its challenges, and the Savior's atoning act the same way again. I feel like I've been given new eyes and a new heart. Words can't describe. Do yourself and your family a favor and read this remarkable book! It is truly a life-changing work."
5,Amazon Verified Purchase,"I always receive GREAT service whenever I order anything here. The book arrived in a timely manner, in good shape.Many thanks"
4,Find Personal Peace,"An excellent book. The use of a parable helps make this lesson less preachy, and helps the reader make personal applications. Sometimes the dialogue is strained, and some of the story is awkward. But the lessons to be learned, if one reads with an open mind and heart can be amazing. I happened to gain a valuable insight while reading this book that kicks my personal opinion up to a 5-star rating, but I think on the whole it is a good solid 4-star book."
5,Review,"This was a very good product. It was in great condition when I recieved it, and it arrived in a timely manner."
5,Applying Christ's Atonement to Me,"This was a fast read, but worthy of deep reflection. It helped me to understand aspects of Christ's Atonement in a new way, and personal application came readily."
4,The Peacegiver,"Though this book reads somewhat like a novel, the purpose is to present the nature and need for forgiveness in a digestable form. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to forgive, wants to let go of a grudge and be make whole through the atonement of Jesus Christ. Well done!"
2,Not very helpful,This book was not very helpful for me because it only described things I already knew and the tips it offered werent that many and werent that helpful.
4,Adult ADD:The Complete Handbook: Everything You Need to Know,"ADD does not end with adulthood. For millions of adults throughout the world, in all types of careers, ADD is something they deal with on a daily basis. This book gives strategies for adults coping with ADD that are informative and easy to follow. I would highly recommend this to individuals and counselors alike."
3,Works for some people but not for everyone,"Bought this for my family and friends. It worked wonderfully for some of them but not for others, regardless of the types or levels of sleep problems."
5,Effective,"This product is effective for achieving sleep quickly if I'm getting home late or experience sleeplessness in the middle of the night. I try to keep it more for occasional use, as I've read studies that lower dose products are better for everyday use, but this is nice to have as well for those trickier times."
5,works well,"When I take two tablets, they seem to work well. I'm able to get to sleep within 1/2 hour, and stay asleep for at least 4; many times, longer."
3,OK,"I liked this product because it didn't leave me groggy for 2 hours after waking up like all the melatonin I tried before. Lately this hasn't worked as well, but that's probably something to do with me or something else I'm taking. And it only works for 1-3 hours, even if I take 2 pills."
5,great product,"I buy it for my brother in law and my mother (I'm the family buyer on Amazon :), both says it improved their sleeping experience. My brother in law says that not only he sleeps better he also wake up full of energy. Before using this product he didn't have a good sleep for a few years. When he tried other products (not based on Melatonin), he slept but woke up tired. He also tried Melatonin pills, but they didn't help."
5,great night's sleep,"i highly reccomend source naturals for melatonin,i've used it for more than a decade with wonderfull results and amazon has the best suppliers and price !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Great,"Once a while I really need sleep but can't fall sleep, then I take it.My favorite part of this is there is no drugged feeling when I wake up.8 hours sleep guaranteed!!"
5,Transported to another time and place,"I absolutely adored this book. It was powerful for me because it gave me an honest, often humorous, but vivid account of a reality I craved knowing more about...the depression years in the Great Plains states. I think I know more about my mother, who grew up a poor tenant farmer's daughter, just a little better. I look forward passing it on to others, and even using it as a wonderful book to read to some of my older friends."
4,Rain-X works wonders,"This product pretty much speaks for itself. I have one vehicle with older wipers and one vehicle with a lame uni-wiper system. In both cases I wanted a cheap fix to get me through the winter months. The wipes go on very easily and work fantastically. It won't totally replace your wipers like it claims, but it will certainly more than make up for bad wipers. An added bonus is that when the rain-x is newly applied the windshield does not frost over! Definitely worth a try."
4,Kim,The book has very up-to-date information and has been a beneficial study guide and learning tool. The book has improved my chances in passing the certification test as well as understanding the concepts. It will also serve as a beneficial resource in the future.
1,Glaring Errors in Editing and Advice,"I will revisit and update this review after I have completed the book. However, since the book is packaged as an overview of 4 distinct subjects, I want to offer my assessment after reading the first of the four topics.The editing is weak. I had to re-read sentences to parse what was really meant and then justify the difference by blaming the confusion on cut-and-paste errors. When this happens in the test questions one has to pay special attention to figure out what is a mistake and what is a fact. Speaking of the test questions, there are at least 2 or 3 that have incorrect answers. This is inexcusable."
5,Excellent Training Resource!,"William Stanek's MCSE Core Required Exams is the best training resource I've found for helping me to study for my exams. I swear this book packs in more than the 4 book set I bought previous to this (and stopped using in favor of this). In his pocket consultants, Stanek has proven he has a gift for getting to the point and being concise while at the same time being comprehensive. This book is not different. This is the single most useful training guide I've ever purchased. Excellent as a reference as well as a study guide. I can't recommend this highly enough. Every network administrator should own at least one copy of this book."
2,Flawed but comprehensive exam cram book,"I would not recommend purchasing this book because it is full of typos and in some places, incorrect information. It could have been GREAT, if only an editor had looked at it! Nonetheless, I own it and still use it because it's great to have so much information (overview as well as nitty-gritty) on Microsoft networking all in one place. It works as a supplement to your studies, albeit a frustrating one if you're like me and like reading final drafts instead of rough drafts."
1,Don't bother,"This is state of the art (circa 1850) anti-Catholic style higher criticism of the Bible at last applied by ""Catholic"" scholars. No opportunity is missed to suggest that the books of the New Testament were probably not written by the traditionally attributed authors. A particularly obnoxious example is the contention that Colossians was certainly not written by Paul (even though Colossians explicitly names Paul as the author). No opportunity is missed to suggest that the texts we have are probably distorted, incomplete, etc. The most grating example is the helpful rearrangement of Philippians, showing the text not as the Bible has it, but as 'scholars' have decided it was probably originally arranged. If you don't believe in Christianity and don't hold the Bible in any particular reverence and think that the Jesus Seminar is really cutting edge theology, this is a good example of Catholic scholars trying to join the club. For all others, pick something else. Please."
1,Sucks balls,"I laugh, ashamed like, when i read Lenore. So I thought ""Hey why not try this ugly cat head thingie"". I read this book in about 10 minutes. I looked at the cover one more time and ripped it up. I threw it away saying ""best 2 dollars ever"". I was being sarcastic, it really sucks. Not worth the paper it's written on. It's not funny, not even so bad it's funny."
2,Not what I expected,"Thankfully, this book is pretty cheap. It had a couple of amusing bits, but I think it tries to get way too much out of a pretty ill-thought out idea. I must admit I did laugh out loud at the crotch joke. And the siamese page. It's just a shame that the narration was so shallow and poorly crafted. It was like reading someone's offhanded ravings typed into a web forum. The artwork, while good, is really not detailed or busy enough to compensate for this. The early Lenore series is much better."
1,Absurdist juvenile death humor for snot-nosed punks?,"Roman Dirge (with a name like that, it's no wonder he's obsessed with death) is the writer/artist for LENORE, THE ADVENTURES OF A CUTE LITTLE DEAD GIRL, an unfunny ongoing series that is exactly what the title says it is. This literalness seems to be Mr. Dirge's crucial limitation. Some idle phrases run through his head, and he doodles a few panels about them. Ergo the pamphlet at hand, THE CAT WITH A REALLY BIG HEAD AND ONE OTHER STORY THAT ISN'T AS GOOD. Take him at his word. The only thing he doesn't tell you is that THE CAT WITH A REALLY BIG HEAD isn't good either. Avoid this childish dreck from an author who can't spell ""misshapen"" and writes, ""I like to think that magical lung beasts come out of my butt late at night to search for food."""
4,Wonderful Dark and Silly Humor,I like many others bought this book because of the author's connection with Invader Zim and I was not disappointed.Anyone with a slightly warped sense of humor over the age of 10 will really enjoy this (especially the young men out there!) and for $2.95 who couldn't cough up the cash for a light fun read.Highly recommend for cartoon and cat lover's alike! My sister-in-law bought it for me and laughed so hard she bought her own copy!
2,Bad Copy,"I don't know how anyone can campare the dazzling heights of romance where Mc Naught takes us to in ""Whitney My Love"" with this book. It started out decently (an obviously like WML) but instead of the warmth and spirit and fire that was so eloquently portrayed in the character of 'Whitney', I found Tiffany to read whinny, petulant and shrewish. Everytime I read about her ""screaming,"" I glanced up to see if my kids were somewhere in the room with me. The only plot line that held a mild interest for me was waiting to see when Tiffany was going to get her horse back. Despite the (graphically overwritten) sex scenes, I thought that Clinton(deservedly)treated Tiffany like an overindulged child. The chemistry was forced. He should have adopted her instead or marrying her. Stick with Mc Naught."
5,A Wonderful Collection,"I have never played a single adventure game that was as funny, intelligent, well-written or enjoyable as this collection of delightful adventure games. I love each and every one; they provide hours of entertainment. From dazzling graphics to superb stories, you will never forget King's Quest."
4,The Cost,i got this by chance when a video game store was going out of sale and paid only 9.99 for it which i see now is a steal i was thinking of getting the compilation but since it has some bad reviews im just gonna keep the ones i have although it does have some problems with windows and DOS going back and forth but i really just got it for KQ7 my faaaaaaaaaave out of all of them...i miss those games..i really do...
3,Was probably good in it's time.,"I have enjoyed the Kings Quest series very much, but I didn't get started until Kings 5. I got this set, but the gameplay and graphics, though a head of their time in their day, was real tough to play in this current day and age. While these all have great stories, graphically and challenging wise, Kings Quest 6 & 7 are the only 2 that are really playable now. Kings 7 is graphically very good and the story and gameplay is pretty cool. The only thing missing from this set is The Mask Of Eternity which is actually Kings Quest 8. Graphically, it's a stellar upgrade over these and the gameplay is faster paced with alot less puzzles to solve. Roberta Williams was definitley ahead of her time and I hope she continues to create these Kings Quest games(go to gamespot.com and look for an article on Roberta Williams. It was an excellent story)."
2,An uneven collection of a (mostly) influential game series.,"The King's Quest series has been long regarded as one of the most influential adventure series in computer gaming history. That may or may not be true--you can decide for yourself if you purchase this package. Unfortunately, only a couple of the games are worthy of being influential--the middle games in the series are the most fully realized and most satisfying games. Most of the others are hollow playing experiences, offering little besides scintillating graphics and usually interesting sound and music. Even the bonus games are, for the most part, mediocre offerings at best. If you are a long-time fan and would like to own the games, it's definitely worth it. But you will most likely otherwise not be swayed to think King's Quest is the greatest game series ever."
4,Read Aloud Rhymes for the Very Young,This is a delightful and fun book for young children. A really good lap book. My 2 year old loves it and chooses it often when we read together. An enjoyable read for both the reader and the listener.
3,Not for the Very Young,"While this is a wonderful book, well written and well illustrated, it is a paper book and is not conducive to the very young (as it states) because of their desire to turn pages (and the resulting tears in the paper). My daughter is 13 months old and prefers her board book of nursery rhymes. I hope she will grow into this book as she learns to turn and not tear."
2,"If you buy it, you can't return it!",Not a familiar rhyme in this book........Not what I thought it would be and now it is mine because it isn't returnable.......
1,Can't stand it,"Perhaps I am more of a traditionalist, but I did not appreciate the nonsensical rhymes in this book."
2,Does not fit in a Dell Rack,Bought this for a Dell rack and it just does not fit. Make sure you check the size of you rack before you buy.
3,VERY THIN,This sweater is so soft and attractive-but it is tissue paper thin-I gave it as a gift to my niece-she loves it--the kelly green is beautiful.
5,monument of devotion,It is impossible to read this book and not draw closer to God. The purity and intensity of Augustine's love for God jumps off each page. Augustine combined a sharp mind and an inflamed spirit to produce this monument of devotion. Buy it and read it.
3,Mixed Feelings,"Overall I would say it is a good read. I think I learned a lot and I don't regret reading it--it is a classic.I found Augustine's account of his childhood, his exposure to the Manichees, and his search for truth to be really interesting.However, toward the end of my reading I found things to get a bit tedious. I found his discussions on the human memory and his overwhelmingly long discourse on Genesis 1:1 to be tedious and somewhat awkward. I also find his allegorical interpretation of the creation to be somewhat far fetched."
3,A delusional book,"Probably the best translation of Augustine. It is rather interesting that someone who was delusional, superstitious, and mentally ill has become famous. Not to mention the fact that he completely abandoned his mistress and his young son to the sole pursuit of wealth and power, an act consistent with his general immorality. He spent most of his life condemning others in righteous indignation claiming he had all the answers to the moral dilemmas faced by humans, including the irrational assertion that our fate is determined by a vengeful god before we are even born. In his book ""The City of God"", he even went so far as to make the absurd claim that the Western Roman Empire fell not because of Christianity but in spite of it. If you're interested in candid autobiographies there are far better ones out there, such as Rousseau, Edward Gibbons or John Stewart Mill. These persons were at least rational and were far better writers."
1,Boring...,"I suppose this work might be inspiring and even entertaining tosome people. However, this is a very select portion of thepopulation. _Confessions_ is, pure and simple, Augustine's justification of his religious beliefs. The text tends to be incredibly repetitious, and belabors inconsequential points. For instance, Augustine takes great pains (many times) to explain that incorruptable is better than corruptable. Whoopee. I will concede that _Confessions_ is more entertaining than _City_Of_God_, but that's small praise indeed. Most likely, you'll end up reading one or both of these works for some college course. Just remember as you're reading through the same idea for the umpteenth time that it doesn't get any worse than this."
3,Wanted: Better suport work,"Augustine's Confessions combines an intellectual biography and conversion story with apologetics and theology. It is an essential source document on one of the most highly regarded Western thinkers and for early Church history. As a conversion story, it sets the standard in Christian thought. In short, any serious student of Christianity cannot afford to miss reading this book.The Penguin Classics edition, translated by R. S. Pine-Coffin, provides a good translation. However, you are going to get what you pay for. Like most books in the Penguin Classics series, this edition of the Confessions leaves a lot to be desired. It has a bare bone's introduction, no notes to help the reader understand obscure passages, and no index. This edition is fine if you want to read Augustine without the distractions of commentary. However, if you want to seriously understand the Confessions, spend some more money and get an edition with better support."
5,Dee,"Alexis Harrington has outdone herself once again. What a wonderful love story. Very true to historical facts about the travails the Irish endured in coming to this country. One travels from Ireland to the American South and then on to Oregon with the hero and heroine. I look forward to reading more of her books. There is suspense, laughter and poignant moments along with a great story of love. Well done Alexis."
1,Bad Editing,"This review refers only to the Kindle edition - I have not looked over the print edition of this bookThis review is not based on the story, or the overall writing of this book. I didn't get past the first two-three pages. The book was so badly edited that I found around three mistakes in my short sojourn into this novel.Rule of thumb:If you can't spend time on editing a book, don't expect me to spend money buying it. Period."
3,Irish Bride,"The book was interesting and entertaining. Easy read, little history about Ireland. Not a lot of brain power needed. I would recommend this book as a nice summer read."
2,Sloooowww,"This book started out wonderfully, I loved the idea and the joining together to go to the US. However, it petered out. I just could not read any further as it just seemed to stall. Farrell to me is such a masculine name too. I love historical fictions, but this one needed a bit more."
3,"Better than good, but not Great!","This is a nice little book when you just want to sort of veg-out. You don't have to think about it and can often guess what's coming next, but all in all a sweet story."
3,Boring,"The book starts off OK, then just dies a death. So slow and predictable. The Author has sort of left the ending open for a sequel - I hope not."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"I purchased this book several years ago, started it and lost interest more than once. Finally forced myself to read it not long ago. I truly wish I could say something positive. I found the plot to start interestingly enough but the charactors could never make me care about them, or what happened to them. I was just glad I was able to force myself to read it so I can pass it on and make space for a new book. All the while feeling I had wasted time and effort better spent elsewhere. Sorry."
4,quick read,"If you like historical romances you will like this one, it is a quick read and keeps your attention. The characters are ones you immediately fall in love with and it has a decent plot that ends ""and they lived happily everafter"". It is a good beach chair book."
4,GREAT READ,"A STORY OF LOVE, LOSS AND REDEMPTION. A good choice for a rainy day or take to the beach. GREAt writing and knowledge of her subject and history."
4,Nice historical romance,I enjoyed this book immensely and wish it would've been a series! It had great historical facts with a romanticism fictional story about the tough Irish they are known to be.
3,Not enough focus on relationship,"There wasn't enough focus on the building of the relationship between Farrell and Aidan. Much of the story was spent running from the villain, which was farfetched to me. The guy pursues them from Ireland to New Orleans to St. Louis across the wilds of America - just too much running away.Alexis Harrington writes beautifully, particularly emotions. Her characters are generally very well defined, but these were lacking somehow. Maybe if Farrell and Aidan had spent more time on their relationship during the months they were travelling it might have all been better."
3,Good quick release.,"It functions, but i do not use it for ice tools, I took it up whitney attached to my ice axe. Its very adjustable and I dont fear loosing my ice axe when this is strapped on.. I got tired of switching wrists back and forth as I climbed up steep ascents, so I attached it to my harness. I liked being anchored to my axe when I sat down on steep terrain. I would trust this with my weight and I am glad I have it."
3,Keep Living - keep getting professional videographers,"I love Ricky and I have all of his DVDs and most of his music. He has the best gospel choir around (on the entire planet). With that said, I was very disappointed in the quality of the DVD. The songs are great, of course, but don't expect much from the quality--from the praise dancers to the recording. Get the CD (because it is awesome) and if you enjoy just watching his amazing choir, buy this DVD, just don't expect it to be of professional quality. I wonder if he saw this before it was released."
5,Love It,"Love, love, love this DVD. So many extra's that you don't get on the CD. I really wanted to see Chrystal Rucker sing Keep Living, but it was not on the DVD. Also If you love Karen Clark Sheard, she puts her foot in it...at the end of The Sweetest Name. They cut a lot of her part on the CD. Ricky(Choir Master Supreme), Patrick Riddick(he looks great with his new look), Larry Jones, and the alto lady that Ricky calls his first daughter, did a great job directing. I think everyone should get this DVD. It is great!"
5,Fabulous,"What a wonderful DVD, it's true choir singing at it's best, I highly recommend this to everyone who loves worship & great singing!!"
4,I expected a better quality dvd,"I am a true fan of Ricky Dillard & New G but this video was not a great quality dvd. The color editing was horrible. It was just a lot of red through out the dvd. The background was red, the robes were red just to much red and to many wardrobe changes."
4,Keep Living Title Track Not On DVD,"If the Title of this DVD is ""Keep Living"" why is it missing from the DVD? It's on the Cd. The DVD has songs that are not on the CD. Some of the songs are not in order according to the listing on the DVD cover. I will have to say that my personal favorite is ""Speak A Word"" Especially at the end when the lady Ricky Calls his first daughter directs the ending of the song. I wish it wasn't faded out on the CD. Otherwise it was a pretty good DVD"
5,WOW! Fantastic CD!!! I'm now a fan!,"Ok, to be honest, I was NOT a Chris Sligh fan on American Idol. But after he was voted off, I heard him on an interview on the Christian Radio station here. He was so funny and interesting, and they played one of his songs (Track 8). WOW! I was intrigued, so I bought the CD. I can't stop listening to it! It's fantastic, and you'd never know it was an independent label. I find myself singing the songs even when I'm not listening to it! Definitely a rock CD, ALL of the songs are great, very professional sounding. Most of the time you buy CD's and then end up with certain songs you skip to, not this one! BUY IT! I hope his next one is just as great!"
5,IN A MOMENT!,"I was totally blown away by this CD, especially track 5, In a Moment. I understand this song was written by Chris Sligh!! Put this out as a single and it'll be a HIT.....WOWI personally thought Chris has a great voice but best on a record and not the stage because he just doesn't have stage presence right now."
3,"Something Beautiful, eh well???","I am a Chris Sligh fan. American Idol got me hooked and I really thought this was going to bowl me over. It didn't. I found it to lack the edge that I thought his music would hold to it. Notice that he produced it, wrote most of the songs himself so perhaps that is where the edge is missing. I don't know for sure, but for the effort, I give it three stars. I look forward to seeing what Chris will do next and will definately give him another look. However, for a first run out, this one lacked. It had a middle ground that sunk in the sand pit sound. Not the Chris Sligh we heard on Idol~Hope Future works are BETTER!!"
4,Good First Album,I like this album especially since it is a first album for a formerly unknown band. The album demonstrates that the band has talent. I look forward to future releases from Half Past Forever and Chris Sligh.
3,Love Chris Sligh,"I love this cd and find Chris to be very. very talented.With that said, I would have to say the only thing I wish different would be that on some of the songs the band seems to over power Chris' voice and I don't like that. I would rather hear his voice than the band go crazy. Otherwise, great cd!"
3,"Sligh , where's the voice?","This effort from recent American Idol vote-off Chris Sligh will dissapoint his many fans from the show, as the overproduction of the background music overwhelms his wonderful voice and leaves us looking for the guy who impressed us so much. He would have still been on, if only he could dance to the beat, but I was really sad that this album did not do anything to quench the thirst to hear his voice. Hope his next efforts are less slick and more Sligh. The guitar is great, but as before, where is Chris behind it?"
2,??????,why are you bunching this album with elliott yamin.....with daughtry maybe.....but so different from elliott yamin....
4,Definitely a classic...,"I agree with the other reviewers...This is a very clear and concise treatment of the theory and practice of sundial construction. It is a very easy read, (anyone over the age of around 12-13 should have no difficulty with it at all,) and entertaining to boot! It has a few items that some of the other 'classics' on sundials do not. (Rene Rohr,s book ""Sundials:History, Theory and Practice"" and Mayall & Mayall's ""Sundial's:Their Construction and Use"".) The only thing this book really misses, (and the same holds true for virtually every book on sundials!) is the link between sundials telling time, and their potential use for navigation. Apart from that, this is a great book, and I highly recommend it."
4,Conference Room Phone Connector,"This product has worked fine for our application. We have had no volume trouble either in hearing the other people or the in them hearing us. It is a bit cumbersome in how you have to dial with one phone and then connect to the speakerphone. Once you get past that step, everything works fine."
4,Works great,A bit pricey but wound up saving us the cost of running a analog log because of our digital phone system.
2,Tries too hard to make a point,"The makers of this movie try so hard to ram their point down your throat that they forget to make a good movie -- which is quite a feat when you have Gary Oldman, Jeff Bridges, Christian Slater, and Sam Elliott all at their best or near best."
5,Noticable difference,"I had received facial toning treatments at a day spa which were too expensive for me to keep up for any length of time. I purchased the Nuface in hopes that it would maintain the results I had gotten from the spa. It not only has kept the tone I had achieved, but is also improving upon it. I am very satisfied and now am wondering if it, like its spa counterpart, can be used on other body parts!"
2,Not worth the price!,"I fail to see any benefits from using this product. I am 54 years old and see no difference after 3 weeks of use. I saw where many complained of using the gel, however that was never a big issue. You don't need much and it wipes off easily with a warm washcloth. I would recommend you keep your money in your pocket."
2,Save your money!,It's just not worth it! It barely does what its supposed to do! Way too pricey for what you get! And it's operated by a 7 voltbattery. Hello what ever happened to a rechargeable operated system?
3,NuFace Microcurrent Toner/Lifting for the face...,"Doesn't really refresh the skin, and kind of bites a bit sometimes, like an electrical shock. And if my hair's wet, I can feel little jolts going up into my scalp.. I haven't been using it consistently, so I can't say whether or not it visibly improves facial muscle tone."
1,Extremely upset,I ordered this product from Amazon as a long time customer. I received the product and did not open or use the product but observed that the product did not appear to be of the quality that would be expected for the price. I returned it in the original box the next day and expected a refund but after little help from Amazon my request has been declined. I will never do business with either company again and please anyone considering this product be very wary.
5,Mine works,I went out and bought a Nuface a few days ago. I can see some subtle changes already and I definitely feel the tightening... My skin looks so healthy and rested. I'm really sorry for the ones it didn't work for because I have bought products that haven't worked for me but they did for other people. I love mine and will continue to use it. Thanks Nuface...
2,Disappointed,"I've used this pretty faithfully for several months and can't see any improvement. If it is just a subtle change, it is too subtle to see. I guess it was pretty silly of me to think that a 9-volt battery could change a 61-year-old jaw line. Oh well."
3,could be better,"Pros: it works.Cons: if you don't use it, your face goes back as how it was before use after less than a week of dicountinuation in use. There must be something better in the market, I've heard of Galvanizer something...Also ... if you set the device to maximum, my wife said she was seeing balls of lights in front of her eyes when applicating this device in her forehead (some time after that there was liquid in an mri in the forehead area). She stopped using it.And now we have a $300.00 device getting dust in the bathroom.I hope this help before you buy it."
2,disappointing,"I had high hopes for this product, but after using it for 2 weeks I didn't see any difference & gave up. It's now sitting in a drawer, & I'll probably never use it again. For the amount of time it took to use each day, I was hoping to see at least some kind of change. If there was any improvement, it was too minimal for me to notice. I got discouraged & bored & chalked it up to one of my dumber purchases. Oh well. Maybe I have the wrong kind of wrinkles."
1,No visible difference,"I got a facial in really nice hotel/spa in Sonoma, CA and they used this on me. Afterwards I had to have one so I rushed out and bought one. I've been using it for months now, and it has made no visible difference on me. I wish I never spent the money on it. I'd would hesitate purchasing it."
4,Great product,This is a great product. You have to keep on using it often to achieve your desired results.
1,A complete waste of money,"Poorly produced apparently from a word processor with some updates handwritten. Right hand margin in many pages cuts off at least one letter. Photo quality so poor that it was a waste of ink. Most are small and grainy of about 200 dpi. Overall quality is that of an inkjet printer and a copy machine. Listing of Sires and Dams does not give color or birthdate. If a male dog is listed as a Champion his dam is given. Then you have to turn to the section for Dams and flip through them to find particulars for the Dam. Either way the only information given is the number for the corresponding issue of the Stud Book. Save yourself money and buy ""The New Miniature Schnauzer"" by Dan Kiedrowski instead."
4,"this is a mellow, unique listen","For those of you who get into the softer side of Pearl Jam, this CD is a must. Jeff Ament's spin-off band, Three Fish creates some excellent music."
4,Three fish is a must have for Pearl Jam fans!,Three Fish is a mellow cd that reminds you of pearl Jam. I wish they would make another CD.
3,I am a tester for maxis and EA,i thought this game could have been better from maxis sim city 3000 is much better so go check it out instead of sim city 2000
4,Great Game(for the price),I've had fun with this game for hours and hours. The gameplay is god. The only 2 bad things is the graphic aren't that great and flood can't wide the city off the face of the earth. It's worth the buy!
3,First No End,If I had a choice between SC 2000 or SC 3000 I'd have to say I'd choose 2000 though its graphics are not as good it's a lot more fun and easier to start. I'll have to admit when I first began playing I was shamelessly addicted. But after two days of playing I had my map completely filled and no more room to build. The game is fun for a short while but gets old real fast. I still highly reccommend this game for a boring tuesday afternoon.
5,This is a Great Game,"This is the ultimate version of Simcity. The newer version has more bells and whistles, but the game is essentially the same. Plus the new version is a memory/resource hog. In this version the urban renewal kit is the best part of the game. It's great to play together with kids (8 - 12) making it a good family game, also. If you like thought provoking, fun and educational games, this one is a winner!"
5,Belisarius delivers!!!!,This excellent third book to the series leaves the reader desperately panting for more. When will the fourth book come out. I especially relish the overarching theme that Belisarius' greatest qualities are: Honor and Loyalty. For in the end: It is the soul that really matters. As de Saint- Exupery put it: What is esssential is invisible to the eye. As Gen. MacArthur put it: Hit 'em where they ain't.
5,"Excellent, Cant wait for the next one",I really enjoyed this book. I liked the gritty descriptions of the battles. The only anoting thing is now I have to wait for the next one.
3,"Fun, but definitely not Drake's finest","An entertaining plot and cast of characters. Very much the epic, with tremendous amounts of attention spent on developing subplots and character backgrounds. Still, the writing style seems very childish at times. The attempts at cuteness really take away from the telling of the story. I never expected such immature writing from David Drake. I hope this Eric Flint guy is the one behind it all."
5,The Fairest of Them All,"I've collected all of Altan's CD's and ""The Blue Idol"" is by far the most graceful, the ""prettiest"" of them all. Some music impresses by it's brute force or by it's passion and intensity, like a drag racer opening the throttle and exploding down the track. The Blue Idol is like watching Formula One driver Michael Schumacher move 800 Horsepower around a twisting, curving race track like a ballet dancer. There is power and intensity here, but it's precisely and expertly driven.And what a lovely surprise to hear Dolly Parton on track four; it's a beautiful affair.This CD is a treasure that you'll not want to pass up."
2,Ugh,What a disappointment! This recording has little to do with music for a child and is mainly Art Garfunkle signing old songs.
5,Art Garfunkel still sings like an angel,"Is it possible that Art Garfunkel has been around for so long, collectively and indivually, that we take his talent and voice so lightly? He truly has the voice for a piece such as this, not only do I find his music irresitable, he can sing me to sleep any time!"
5,great book,"This is an excellent book on many levels. I saw a copy a year or so ago and placed it on my Amazon wish list and this Christmas my wish came true. I have flipped through it and am now reading it. I will write some more when I finish, but it is clear after only a short time with this book that it is worthy of our attention. Also, it is now selling at modest prices and well worth it. It is altogether possible that the excess supply will sell out and the price go up, so you should buy one soon."
3,"frame is strong, seat flexible","Though the frame is strong, the tiny plastic seat is way too flexible. When you sit on it, the seat bends down in the middle, which is very unsettling. I have an older commode that has a wide and rigid seat that feels secure. This flimsy little seat requires careful aim as you sit, and feels like you are actually seated on the front and rear bars of the frame."
1,Terrible Phone,"I purchased this phone today and put in 4 batteries, only to discover what an utter waste of time this purchase was. It didn't work. No display. The ring is annoying. The cord is too short, and can't be replaced because it is wired into the phone. Then I remembered that GE products are now made by a company named Thompson Electronics, and that I had a problem with an item, manufactured by Thompson, several years ago. I can't believe I repeated that mistake."
1,Do Not Order This Item,"This phone has all of the features that you are looking for and a venerable brand name.Reasons not to buy it include:o Poor sound qualityo Non-Replaceable handset cordo Low quality, hard-to-read displayI read a review that noted the handset cord issue, but a photo showed a standard jack and plug. It turns out that the handset cord has a nice, industry standard plug at one end but the other end - not depicted in the photos I viewed - is hardwired.Even if one could overlook this ""feature,"" it demands the question: Can the rest of the engineering be just as amaturish?Mine is on the regifting list."
4,Item Works as Expected,"The phone does as described. Its nothing special, but is good to have just in case something happens to the cell phone. The caller id works fine and the volume is okay on the phone."
4,Wish I had such a car,"""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" was my favorite movie during early childhood. I was pleasantly surprised that the book tells a different story than the movie, although it conveys the same sense of adventure. Ian Fleming wrote ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" in a different style than more current children's literature, something that may bring a change of pace to a young audience. I don't think the crude illustrations by Burningham would be received in the same manner."
4,A Very Jolly Adventure,"It's sort of a shame that this book has fallen off the kids-lit radar, (look at how old the reviews are, and how they default to the movie version). It has a solid, basic premise, it has resourceful, alert kids, it has helpful supportive parents and it is well-written for an early young reader. It's full of danger! and adventure! without being truly scary. It's very satisfying for a younger reader to follow the plot and the development of the story. Vocabulary is at a good level. Siblings cooperate and problem solve. It's short enough to not overlabor the premise, but long enough to be ""a real book"". Oh, and it's fun.So, is it a life-changing classic? Well, no. But, if you run across a copy of this somewhere, it would be a happy read and a worthwhile addition to your kids library."
5,THe best children's book ever,This is my favorite children's book ever! I have read it at least 10 times--gets better every time!! Read this book to your children.
5,BEST BOOK EVER! (And hillarious at that!),"""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" is a funny story, and the most exciting book ever! I definitly liked the illustrations in the book, and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang should go down in history!"
5,"""Better than the movie!""","My children (7 and 5) watched the movie, prior to the book, embracing it with great delight. After a few months passed, I introduced them to the audio book. My son typically enjoys audio books, as long as he's strapped down on a car ride. However, faced with many other ""active"" options, once back home, he rarely asks to continue listening to many audio books. This one was the exception. Both my children LOVED it. And, when I asked which was better, the book or the movie, my 7 year old boy heartily replied, ""The book!"""
3,SLOW!,I ordered from 3 sellers in this order. These books came 2 weeks after the other sellers. SLOW!
3,A Good Horselovers Book,I liked the book. I love Thoroughbreds. Maura Langston is the main charecter. She falls for a boy named Kevin who falls for her. When he wants to do a little more than she's prepared for hearts are broken. However the end is good and the book leaves you wanting more.
4,Reflective and Soothing Music,"This recording always relaxes me. I can put it on and find that my mind wanders with it...thinking about God and coming back to the present then drifting back to God again. The music has a soothing presence that draws my spirit to the Lord. Also, I have never grown sick of listening to this collection. The songs tend to blend together, and then the next thing I know the music is over and I am sad to see the songs end.I would definitely recommend this as a welcome addition to anyone's devotional music collection. But if you do get this recording, don't expect to be overwhelmed by the songs on the first listening. They are gentle songs that grow on you after some quiet reflection and time."
5,Favorite,"This is one of my favorite Bryan Duncan albums. He does a superb job of lifting our inner man up to God. I especially enjoy 'Oh, Love that will not let me go'."
5,Fast Service - Enjoyable product.,I bought this for my husband and he loves it. It arrived quickly and in very good condition -- the CD plays well and the case was still intact. The music style of this CD is very soothing and relaxing to listen to. An enjoyable product.
4,Aye Chingow....,next time the power is out - i'm cookin' with this! eclectic? sultry? different... could be a soundtrack for a good movie (film if you live in socal). find it. check it out. might just fill one of those dents in your soul.
2,Needs more editing,"This book is riddled with mistakes. To name a few, 1. it says that cows are related to horses and swine (if you are going that far back in evolution then you might as well say that they are related to us), 2. several photos have misnamed the breed of cow in the picture, 3. says that Guernseys come from France (they originated on the channel island of Guernsey), 4. a photo shows some Muskoxen as being a type of wild cow (they are more closely related to goats), 5. the book states that cows have no incisors (they do have LOWER incisors). I could go on."
1,Unepic plot,"I read the whole book just to see if Tyler and Katelyn would get together. I was really not into the book from the very beginning. There was no real drama going on, only this dating trial. There was no epic plot that made me get interested in this book. I only got slightly interested when Stephen came into the picture, and it wasn't by a lot. All I can say about this book is that I feel I wasted my time reading this one and should have picked another book to read. For all the people that love drama happening in books do NOT read this book. If you like books that contain only dating and no actual big events going on then this is the right book for you."
5,A great southern read for children,"Growing up in the south, I am always a bit cautious of literature set in the south. However, Me and Rupert Goody was a fun read that adults will enjoy reading to children."
2,"Good, But Not The Best","It is a good book overall, but at the begining, they say hell to much.They also say that the mother slaps her sons.My daughter enjoied this book, but she ran over to me alot pointing out things that are wrong to put in a kids book."
5,The Barbararians Are Coming,"Funny and poignant, I read this book quickly and was sad to see it end. The back stories of the characters bring real insight into their humorous, heartfelt lives. Sterling (the protagonist) is clearly caught between two generations of Asians and is struggling against forces not even he is aware of."
4,An Engaging But Frustrating Read,"The Barbarians Are Coming is an interesting story, but altogether frustrating due to the main character's inability to act upon, or even recognize, his emotional response to any given relationship. His relationship to his father,his wife, and to a lesser extent, his mother, is frought with tension due both to cultural disparities and emotional immaturity. He rejects his Chinese heritage, but feels lost in his American birthright. His passivity is at once frustrating and an elemental part of the story. In the end, though, you just want to grab him by the shirt collar and shake him into awareness of all of the damage he has done by not doing anything decisively in his life."
2,Not as nourishing as I had hoped,"Well written and often witty, but lacking in substance and sometimes embarrassingly self-indulgent. The book could have used a good editor (on several counts)."
4,...intriguing...,"A.A. Clifford (Gary Hardwick) offers a intriguing look into the one aspect of human living the often has a stronghold on many. Sex Life is a futurist look at survival beyond need. Male and female interaction ...holds a more significant importance than in present day (today). The ramifications of living without is deadly.This sci-fi novel is definitely an intellectual read, and a thought provoking page-turner.Reviewer: LC"
4,Fascinating Imagination,"This first segmant of A.A. Cliffords ""Sex Life"" trilogy is like nothing I have read before. Although sci-fi is not my usual reading genre the whole concept (sex with no pleasure, but necessary for survival) drew my interest. Wow! What an imagination to say the least. This novel was well thought out. The picture of 2268 A.D. that the author paints was a little slow paced, but definately left me anxious to read the continuation. A nice, different read.EnglishrulerARC Book Club Inc.Star Rating: 4 Stars"
1,Find another Max 8 book,"Avoid this book and spend your time on another if you want to learn Max. There are numerous files required for the tutorials that are missing from the CD, and easily dozens of omission/typos that will have you going in wrong directions if you don't figure things out on your own. I even contacted the publisher re: this and they simply pointed me to their website that has the downloadable color versions of the book's black & white screenshots, but they haven't bothered to make the missing textures and guide images available.This book was simply not edited nor were the tutorials tested in Max after the authors wrote it. Seriously, don't even buy this used as you will not get your money's worth. LOUSY!!!!!!"
5,Great Cookie Cutter!,This is a great cookie cutter! I had been looking around locally for a mitten cookie cutter for my mom because I had one in my set and she didn't! I finally found one on line and it is a great quality and perfect size. Makes mitten cookies at a great size... just like advertised!
5,One of Woody's Best,"Probably not everyone would agree with me on this, but I think this is one of Woody Allen's top 5 movies, and pretty close to the top 1 or 2. It is just as good as ""Another Woman"" (which is often considered his ""best"" drama) and all of the performances are captivating throughout the film. The pacing of ""September"" is excellent-83 minutes is the perfect length for the story, and it is not overly drawn out nor does it move too quickly. If you don't know this film, be warned that it is not a comedy, but a drama-on par with Bergman-although Elaine Stritch does have some pretty funny lines...This is definitely one to check out (and since the DVD is so reasonably priced, you should just buy it). By the way, the DVD transfer is much cleaner than any VHS copy I have seen, so the cinematography can be appreciated even more."
3,Nice enough but we've seen it before,"This is a fine ensemble cast, in the closed setting of a Vermont country house--we never even see the outdoors. The music is appropriately downbeat, as is the rainy weather that dominates much of the story. However, if you've seen Another Woman or Interiors, you have already seen this type of story, so it is nothing new and is inferior to them."
5,exceptional,"Yes, this is an exceptional Allen film that surely isn't for everyone. This film is strong in character as to be Shakespearean...hence the mixed reviews. Many don't understand Shakespeare, and just as many don't understand Allen. If you love plot revelation based on pathos...get thee to a video store!"
3,typical Allen disenchantment but not his best,"Another Allen movie about the volatility and relative meaninglessness of it all, September is not as rich of dry humor and effective punch lines as some of his other films. He investigates jealousy, bitterness, betrayal, love, but it is all not as deep as seen elsewhere in Allen's prolific filmography.My favorite quote: ""Universe is haphazard, morally neutral and unimaginably violent."" I tend to agree."
4,Like a Play,"Never mind what the others think. This is a great little movie, with the usual fantastic jazz soundtrack. The mother is the best character because she seems to have had a life and still has a personality. The others are a bit wishy-washy, especially Mia Farrow. You can see why Woody had his fill of her. Beautiful interiors of a perfect Vermont country house. You'll laugh when the mother throws some house-hunters out. There are laughs in this picture."
4,waxy but good,"Taste is horrible, but it does what it should: moisturizes and protects. Also has a nice shimmer to it. I've used this for years when its uncouth to have a fruity smell to my lipgloss."
4,Favorite Cheese Cracker,"These are my favorite cheese cracker. I cannot find them at any of the local stores. I was happy to see them on Amazon and have bought them here, but at a lower price. I do not think the crackers are worth $6 per box. This price is too high!"
4,Better Cheddars at Amazon,"Better Cheddars aren't as good as they used to be, although they are still a good snack. They tend to crumble in the shipping, however, which makes them less desirable. I will go back to getting them in the local grocery, even if they cost more per box."
1,RIPPED OFF,I ordered two sets of six boxes each. I paid for my product. What came was a shock. 2 BOXES! YES!2 BOXES for 23.00. What a rip off. Guess I should look into this matter quickly.
2,C. Medina,Midland WR11 AM/FM Clock Radio with NOAA All Hazard Weather Alert- It's very small- the sound quality is poor
3,Alarm off? No alerts!,"Nice compact size, good audio and signal reception, but one glaring design flaw: There is no instruction in the user's manual about how to disable the clock radio alarm feature without also disbling the weather alert feature and no amount of fiddling with the settings is able to remedy this problem. If you want one mainly for the weather alert feature, keep looking. Also, this unit only receives weather alerts, not others like Amber Alerts."
2,Performs as advertised,"I bought this radio about 4 months because our neighborhood has had a few too many close calls with tornados. The radio performs well. It announces EVERY weather and flood alert in the ENTIRE area covered by St Louis NOAA. That is a huge area. After being awaken 6 times last night by thunderstorm alerts a half a state away I ordered the WR300. Unlike the WR11, the WR300 has S.A.M.E. tech which allows filter out warnings that do not apply to the area you are actually in and you can also filter out all alerts but the ones about life-threatening situations. Hopefully in a week I will no longer be awoken by an alert about the threat of a thunderstorm 100 miles away. I wish I had spent the extra $15 a few months ago."
4,Read Carefully - No S.A.M.E.,"I goofed when purchasing the WR-11. It does not have Specific Area Message Encoding (S.A.M.E., which narrows down the alerts to only the counties you specify). Choose the WR-300 for a clock radio with weather and S.A.M.E.Otherwise the radio performs beautifully. Great reception of the three weather channels in my area. Good reception of radio stations (as good as my car stereo). Alas, because it lacks S.A.M.E. it does not replace my WR-100. But if you don't care about S.A.M.E., this radio functions beautifully."
3,Quite nice,Gave this to my dad as a Christmas gift. He really likes it(display is big enough for him to read it).
3,Decent weather radio for a small price.,"This radio is fine for the weather aspect, as it seems to work with no problem in that regard. Also, it functions as a basic alarm clock and is small, making it great for travel. I find the radio reception, however, to be fair but not great. There are many stations that struggle to come in or are simply overpowered, in my experience. My Grundig Traveler radio receives these stations perfectly.The speaker is another weak point on the radio. It's fine for the weather report but most music I listen to on it sounds distorted and full of static at times even though I have tuned in the station correctly.For the money, this radio is okay and worth purchasing for the weather aspect and as a basic alarm clock, in my opinion. I would not recommend it for regular radio listening."
3,Slightly mislead,"The wire is fine for what it is. Unfortunately when you search for ""flat speaker wire"" this comes up in the search and you can't tell from the stock photo that this is NOT flat speaker wire. So if you are looking for OFC speaker wire with an off-white jacket this is good. If you aren't concerned with the jacket color, then any other OFC wire will work equally well. If you are looking for flat speaker wire, this is not for you (though it is relatively low profile)."
4,Useful for transferring sound to speakers,"Well made. Cut your own length, buy some AR banana clips, hook up, and listen."
1,Where is it?,"I can't believe it takes a week to ship this! Shipped 6/7 and now it's 6/13 - with no sign of the speaker wire! I ordered a subwoofer cable from another online retailer and it arrived the next day with free freight!! C'mon Amazon, what gives?!6/19-update - after it finally arrived, it turned out to be good stuff. Nice insulation, stripped easily, looks good. The printing on the one side is a bit light, so it took a little effort to tell apart since the wire itself is copper in both strands. I'd order the product again but from someone who ships faster - there was no resason for this to take so long to arrive."
5,Good product,Good 16 gauge speaker wire. Looks much better than my old black and clear speaker wires on the wall.
1,Does Everyone Have 15 Minutes of Fame?,"This is an interesting book, if only from the perspective that it lists almost anyone who achieved 15 minutes worth of fame (or notoriety). Some of the information is incorrect such as the address of a particular cemetery (a fairly standard inconsistency). Is it worth its hefty price tag? Probably not. I didn't find the kind of information I was looking for. After looking over this book, I realized I had just tossed a nice piece of change out the window and would probably not use this as a source of reference in the future. However, in all fairness, anyone interested in the grave locations of civil war or congressional grave locations, might find this book very useful and have a completely different take on this book."
5,A must for all. Required reading with my company leaders!,"When you sit down to read this book, grab a pen and paper, the ideas will start to flow. I have a small company with 35 employees, all the team leaders have been required to read and study the ideas in this book. In the past 2 months, the ideas generated have made an impact (for the better). It's obvious the authors' have rolled up their sleeves and dug dip into these and several other companies. These ideas can be applied to a one-person shop or a 300 employee company. But like anything else, implement your thoughts and ideas, they're useless unless you do something with them. Highly recommend it. Plan to read and reread."
5,Very Insightful,"This book is full of interesting commentary and true to life stories about some of the fastest and best run companies in the world. Interesting to note that as quickly as each of these companies grew, they are still booming even after the internet bubble has burst. Jennings and Haughton dug deep into the minds of these inspirational leaders, and were able to relate their thoughts to anybody who wants to run a ""fast"" business today."
5,A Must Read,"This is a breakthrough book. Jennings and Haughton outline specific tactics used by today's most successful enterprises. They've done a masterful job of dissecting the ingredients that have made companies like AOL, Charles Schwab, and Clear Channel Communications the success stories of this decade. They offer a practical, step by step guide that any business, large or small, can easily implement. This book, along with Seth Godin's Permission Marketing, are the two key business book Bibles for any leader who wants to win in the 21st century."
1,Ridiculous restatement of basic business practices!,"This book fails to live up to its hype. Within the first few pages, it becomes apparent that the authors are merely restating obvious principles of basic business practices as they tell you to look for new trends, search out new markets, observe what is happening around you, etc. Perhaps the most ludicrous example is contained on page 34 where they recommend that you go out and hire some gay employees and advisors, and if you are uncomfortable with that concept, seek out psychiatric help to find out why you feel that way. This is a lifestyle/political statement that has no place whatsoever in a book touted as being the key to business success. This book is little more than pablum for the average business person and certainly isn't worth what it costs."
1,Retitle this book to: How to Lose Credibility in Business,This book lacked any new insight into business. At times it was completely ridiculous. The authors presented little regarding the basic rules of business and filled the remaining pages with nonsense. How anyone can read this book and believe that they can improve their day to day business operations is a bigger fool than the authors.
4,Tasty crowd pleasing staple,"'Jarlsberg cheese is a Norwegian Emmentaler type cows milk cheese with large holes, a rich buttery texture and mild, sweet nutty flavor. It has a slightly lower fat content than Swiss cheese, and melts easily' wonderful on a sandwich or on crackers."
4,Ge Corded Slimline Phone,"It's a good phone, works well. I like the Caller ID & Function buttons being a different color than from the rest of the phone, makes them easier to see & use. It has good sound & a ring tone that doesn't jangle the nerves.The only problem I had with it is that the cord goes directly into the phone & one must use the cord that the phone comes with, rather than one already in use. I purchased an adapter so that I could plug it into an extension phone cord because we needed to put it some distance from the wall jack. Not a big deal in my book but one I didn't learn about until I got the phone.Overall I am pleased with it."
1,Product description incorrect,THe product was described as haveing a backlit LCD display. This phone display is NOT backlit and is very hard to see when wall mounted.
2,Just Okay,"received this phone and I am a little disappointed,the cords are not replaceable and they are too short, other than that it suits the purpose for a land line phone."
1,Shouldn't be called a CALLER ID phone,"I am replacing this phone, as the display is extremely hard to read. By the time I can decipher who's calling, it's about time for voicemail to pick up. Over the last few months, the caller ID apparently is displaying the number of whoever called LAST time -- i.e., is not displaying who's actually calling at the moment. (Our other Caller ID phones work fine.) Maybe there's a battery that needs replacing somewhere, but I've never had to fool with that in any phone I've ever owned."
3,not a speakerphone,This phone works fine as a caller id phone. However I purchased the phone because it advertised as being a speakerphone. The phone is not a speakerphone. The company was very responsive to my complaint and I am happy with the speedy resolution to my complaint.
1,Not very sturdy and too narrow.,"The bagpack looks great online but its not very sturdy. The liner on the bag keeps hanging out while you're trying to drag the bagpack. It's very narrow, which is very hard to put books and folders in. Theres only one big compartment on the outside so everything is mixed up in there..so unorganized!!!"
4,Very cute doll bed,The bed was relatively easy to put together. There is no mattress but what you see is a blanket/quilt. The canopy is very nice. My daughter wanted a bed for her doll that had a canopy since her bed has one. So this was perfect. She has really enjoyed putting her doll to sleep every night. Good buy for the price.
5,Awesome little girl present!,"Very nicely done and good weight to the bed. I didn't see it put together, as it's a present, but I'm sure it will be a big hit for Christmas!"
3,The structure is great- could use a better canopy,The canopy that goes over the bed leaves much to be desired. The structure of the bed is solid. For the price I would deftinetly get it again- I'll just have my mother make a new canopy
3,This one is going back,It's very pretty but for the price we found later you can get bunk beds for the same price. This would be great tho if you plan on only having 1 doll.
4,Daughter loves!,"My daughter loves this bed for the dolls. The bed fits a 18"" doll with no problem. Only down side is the company does not stay on well. I have to keep putting it on and trying it."
3,Delicate materials,This toy is made with fairly delicate materials. The bottom is thin. A good step on it by a toddler would break it. Definately not good for a lively youngester. We got the bed for the family cat. He weighs 12 lbs. and is gentle with it. We've added additional blankets to it as what came in the box was like a sheet.
3,[The Psychology] of the Upset Book,"While the Upset book defines the various escalation points of dealing with upset people, it tends to get a little technical from a psychological perspective.I purchased the book to use as research for preparing a negotiation skills training class. Instead of tactics to get beyond anger, I wound up getting a psychology lesson. Not sure that I needed that level of detail.If psychology is your thing - and you want to understand the mechanics of getting upset - this is the book for you."
5,The Plyometrics Guru,"High-Powered Plyometrics (DVD) by Jim Radcliffe is intended for use by serious athletes and coaches who wish to learn Plyometrics and the necessary progressions to proceed through a program safely from a guru of performance ehancement. This is not intended for the recreational athlete who is looking for an exercise video. To truly understand the proper progressions behind the demonstrations, I would also recommend purchasing his book (of the same name) and Functional Training for Athletes at All Levels. I have attended trainings with Jimmy Radcliffe and have found him to be extremely knowledgeable as well as capable of demonstrating the exercises from his book. If you are looking for a well-produced DVD which illustrates the high-powered exercises from his orginal book, then this is definitely for you."
3,It served its purpose for me,"My complaints about this book would be the technical/sports science explanations of how plyometric training works and benefits an athlete left me feeling like I have attention deficit disorder when trying to read and understand them. Many of the exercises featured even if done with perfect form look like injuries waiting to happen and I won't ever bother even trying them. Also there is nothing on plyometric pushups and for that matter there are no upper body exercises except those involving the core and those for the most part all require a medicine ball. The good points are they do a good job of explaining the exercises and how to do them properly both with pictures and text. But the bottom line here is I found about 10 new exercises that I will be adding to my repetoire for explosive conditioning, which was what I was looking for when I borrowed this from the library."
4,Very practical introduction to plyometrics,"This book presents a very well explained basic introduction to plyometrics. The science is clearly presented in layman's terms. The importance of plyometrics is well justified. The excercises are the most important and common ones, and generally well described. There is no doubt that plyometrics will take your athletic practice to the next level. It should have been made clearer though that the progression must be executed very slowly and carefully to preserve the joints"
3,much of the exercises are for the outdoors,"I never actually used this video. I thought it would be like other fitness videos I own, which are suitable for following in one's living room. This one is not. It mostly shows you outdoor excercises, some of which require special equipment. I don't doubt that it is a quality video, but it is not what I had in mind at all."
5,Good Season Shows,"Kyra Sedgwick closes cases in her unique way, southern charm with a quick barbed wit that gets the job done. The interaction with her squad, boss & fellow employees are fun to experience; the drama & humor are good entertainment. Blend in Brenda Leigh Johnson's personal life and you have a perfect show to watch!"
2,NOT A GOOD CUT AT ALL!,"I've never had to really think about the quality of a toe nail clipper before. I've always had Revlon that I buy at a drug store and they worked great. I lost that pair so needed a new 'big' clipper. I've used other tweezerman products that I've liked so trusted the name brand. These clippers suck! They barely cut & when they do, it's not a sharp even edge. Back to the drugstrore clippers for me."
1,BAIT & SWITCH,THOUGHT I WAS ORDERING A DUPLICATE NAIL CLIPPER OF WHAT I ALREADY HAD (CAN'T REMEMBER HOW I OBTAINED THE ORIGINAL) BASED ON THE PICTURE OF THE CLIPPER THAT WAS DISPLAYED. THE CLIPPER I RECEIVED WAS NOT WHAT WAS DISPLAYED & DIDN'T GIVE A SHARP CLEAN CUT LIKE THE ORIGINAL DOES. I RECEIVED A TIMELY & EFFICIENT REFUND OF MY MONEY BUT WOULD RATHER HAVE RECEIVED THE CLIPPER I ORDERED. I WAS INFORMED THE PICTURE WAS PROBABLY STALE & NEVER CHANGED.
5,Sturdy and Sharp!,Seem to work just fine and are sharp. Don't know how long that will last but will update when I know more.
1,Cheap Product,This is a really cheap product. The nail clipper broke in third use. I did not have the original packaging so I could not return.I will not buy this d... brand again.
3,Nail clipper set not what we hoped for.,We were hoping for a sharp easy to use clipper better than the Revlon variety. I have arthritis and was hoping it was easier to use. It's sharp but doesn't clip as easily as my old Revlon clipper. I'm disappointed since we thought the stainless steel was the way to go. We'll stick with what we have or go to the Japanese variety.
2,Not a clean cut,Pros:* They look goodCons:* Cut is not clean- thin flap left holding the trimming to the nail so that you then have to tear or pull the trimming off and then file the ragged edge.* blades are tall and vertical so that it's a challenge to get them under the nail (between the nail and fingertip).
5,Clean cut for me,New these are sharp and cut easily; I hardly had to apply any pressure. Work great for me; don't feel like they will fall apart like others I've had in the past. Under $10 seems like a fair price.
3,Satisfactory,"While these are well made products, they are not worth the money. Nothing special here, but does get it's job done."
1,POOR CLIPPER SET,I TRIED THESE CLIPPERS AND THEY WERE NOT THAT GREAT. THEY DID NOT CUT AS I EXPECTED. THEY DID NOT SEEM TO BE SHARP. IT COULD BE THAT I RECEIVED A BAD SET BUT IN ANY EVENT I WAS NOT SATISFIED. THEY ALSO DID NOT HAVE A NAIL CLEANER - THAT YOU CAN OPEN FOR LEVERAGE WHEN CUTTING. I FEEL BADLY - THEY LOOKED SO GOOD.
2,"Well, I'm unimpressed with these","I was so excited to purchase this set for my husband whom is very pickey about his clippers. Him and I both love tweezerman tweezers, so I figured that these would be equally impressive. Well, they're not. They are so hard to press down. My nails are thick, but my husband and sons aren't at all. My son's are actually very thin, so there should not have been any problem with his at all. If you need a real workout for your hand, then go ahead and get these, if not, consider something else. I'm going to continue my search for the perfect clippers. If these loosen up, I'll update my review, but I don't think there's any hope."
1,Tweezerman : Only Makes Good Tweezers,"These clippers, both of them, do not cut clean. Instead, they leave sharp, ragged edged nails. I don't know why I bought another Tweezerman product. The scissors I bought for trimming my mustache pull, not cut, my hair which HURTS A LOT. I originally bought a pair of tweezers for my eyebrows that were actually really good. The rest of their products I have tried however, are junk. Stay away from Tweezerman. Go spend a little more money on something German."
2,Rusted Stainless Steel?,"These are nice heavy duty nail clippers, but mine started rusting towards the back. Wait... how can stainless steel rust? I haven't figured that one out yet. At least there is no rust on the blades though. Also, the toenail clipper is a flat edge cut. It is not rounded like the fingernail clippers. I dont know about everyone else, but I like my toenails rounded not jagged. But otherwise, they are a really heavy duty set of clippers and very sharp also. Cuts through my nails like butter. I give it a 2 for the fact that we have a stainless steel item that is rusting."
4,Nail Clipper,I nned new clippers and found that the Tweezeman clippers were rated well. They work just fine. I find the toe clipper works well on the fingers too.
5,surprisingly really nice,Considering these are fairly inexpensive I wasn't sure what to expect. I have been very happily surprised. These are nice heavy clippers that work great. They don't have the file attachment many nail clippers do but that aside the construction of these is top notch and well worth the price. The cut cleanly and have a sharp edge. Nice product. I would buy again in a heart beat.
1,toenail cutter doesn't work,"Maybe my toenails are just too thick, but this cutter just is not heavy duty enough to cut them... I threw them away upon first use. My old toenail cutters were the same design but I don't know who made them...they worked fine... heavier duty metal and much sharper. These are junk IMHO."
1,Defective cutting edge,Mine came with a a tiny nick on one of the cutting edges which created a defective cut. I replaced it with aSeki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipperwhich has worked great. I now have 3 of the Seki's which all work perfectly.Maybe I just got unlucky with the Tweezerman but the fact that my first and only purchase was defective make me question the quality control.
5,Everything you could want in a clipper set,"I purchased this set to not only get a new clipper for use at home, but also to have the smaller clipper to throw in my travel kit. Both work well, and are extremely sharp. I also appreciate the non-polished surfaces on the clippers -- I feel it makes them easier to grip."
5,"Discotheque 74, Lush funky Guinean genius","If you are a Bembeya Jazz National or Mory Kante fan you will absolutely adore this record. It is a reissue of a 1974 vinyl release by the Guinean state record company, Syliphone, that collected hit singles from that label.My favorite track is ""Ancien Combattant,"" (The Veteran) which has a wild galloping 6/8 rhythm underlying the recitation of a WWII veteran's trials and tribulations. Both the words and the music are riveting. The Kaloum Star track, ""Maliba,"" also sets down a pretty funky groove, anchored by a choppy guitar lick and punctuated by explosive horn riffs.Put this CD on your player; it will transport you to a smoky, sweaty nightclub in Conakry, the Guinean capital, some 30 years ago."
3,"Good product, questionable customer support","I received the radio yesterday and I like its size and features. Unfortunately, the unit cane with a set of four AAA 650mAh NiMH batts whos general quality is extremely poor: on two of the batteries, the positive end is either not properly plated, or is already corroding. Worse, a third one is shorted and will not take a charge. I called warranty support to see if they would simply send me a set of new batts, but they refused. I talked to a supervisor, and she refused, I then talked to the supervisor's supervisor and she refused. They want me to return the entire unit (at my expense) for for repair/replacement (possibly with a refurb unit).I put in a set of alkalines and all works well. I'm going to mail back the 4 NiMH's tomorrow and see what Audiovox does."
5,not to be missed,"It's a pity this recording is so hard to obtain: several of the songs presented are among the most beautiful in this genre, and the singing and playing live up to the high standard. I like the fact that Nigel Rogers doesn't pepper the lovely melodies with too many flourishes -- he uses just a touch, here and there, and it's just right. Highly recommended, if you can find it."
1,"false, inaccurate and full of lies","This book is written by a guy who was kicked out of this great progressive and secular party, and he just can't get over it. So, he publishes lies and fabrications as a way to get back at them. I would recommend these two books: ""Lebanon: The Politics Of Frustration--the Failed Coup Of 1961 by Adel Beshara (2005)"" and ""Syrian nationalism: An inquiry into the political philosophy of Antun Sa'adeh by Adel Beshara (1995). You can also visit the ssnp's web site: ssnp.com"
5,This is definiately the best POG cd ever!,"I absolutley love LLOM, it's the best POG cd ever! My favorites here are God Forbid, reminding us to keep our reverence for the Lord when we speak or sing of His name... how often we take Him for granted, it's a humbling song. Circle of Friends, reminds me of my friends in college, and my fellow POG fans You Are The Answer, there is hope in this world with Jesus!"
1,Why are they singing a evil song?,"I thought they were a christian group so why are they singing Earth, Wind & Fire - Sing A SongNot worth the money, maze well buy some satanic album.Separate yourselvesThey certainly are not"
5,gift for relative- michelle tumes,"I ordered this cd and it came very promptly, well packaged, and in greatcondition....thank you Joan"
5,Fun and great to listen to!,This CD and Steady On are some of my favorite CDs. I love to upbeat songs and the slower heart-touching ones. Buy this CD because you will love it! God Bless!
5,Go POG!!!!!!!!!!!,"Who couldn't like Point of Grace??????? Their songs are truly inspirational, and their voices are a gift from God. I'm 12 and I borrowed The Whole Truth from my grandma. (I haven't given it back yet.) But first I saw an interview on TV with them and I wanted to listen to their music when I heard a demo. I know own Life, Love, and other Mysteries, and Steady On. They are all sooo good!!!!!!!! Give me an email if you're a fan of POG!!!!!"
3,Refreshingly different to Pratchett's other books,"I know there are those who would crucify me for expressing this, but I honestly get a bit sick of Discworld and wish Pratchett would write more stuff that's not set there, and this book certainly fits that bill. It's not his best work by a long way, but if you enjoy the Discworld books (or theJohnny Maxwell seriesorthe Bromeliad) and are looking for something similar but in a bit of a different vein, this is worth a read."
4,"A Good ""Starter"" Pratchett Book","It started off kinda slow , and at times was kind of confusing, but was really, very good. i recommend it highly."
2,Kind of a Let-Down,"I did not know that this book was written before the rest of the Discworld series when I read it, so I was disappointed when it turned out to be sci-fi 36 books into a series that I thought was strictly fantasy.Granted, I could see how some of the fantasy elements in the rest of the series could be explained by a a lot of the technology in Strata, but there are also other aspects which do not compute--such as the existence of zombies and all of the chaos that happens when Death neglects his duties.In other words, it's good for what it is--a novel about the Discworld which comes from the science end of the literary spectrum--but since I was expecting fantasy and got sci-fi (not that I don't love sci-fi in its own right) it's nowhere near as good as the rest of the series. I firmly believe that genres shouldn't be mixed in a series or story unless they're all present from the start."
1,"This man is not an author, his is a compiler of hi(plentiful) dislikes!","What agony. There is nothing worth reading in this ""book.' To read Sailing in Stitches is to peruse a cranky coots' personal list of intense dislikes. That's it.John Cocker is a self-absorbed bore. There is not an interesting sentence to be found. It isn't just the lack of content, either--the writing is execrable (Ex: He leaves Dominica, ""passes along the coast of Costa Rica""-- on the way to St Thomas (!!!!?)Pity the poor souls who slaved on the boat for him and THEN also had to pay--both in silver and by having to remain, trapped on the boat,in the presence of this oafish lout.I had so looked forward to reading this--it is extremely discouraging to find that there is nothing here but a constant trickle of spleen.yuk."
5,"Solid, affordable speaker wire","Recently got a new AVR and 5.1 surround speakers. Used this 16awg wire to run all speakers - front, center and rears. Wire is run under racetrack along the baseboards. Speakers sound great and wire fit very nicely in a small raceway. It's affordable and does the trick. Don't fall for the marketing hype of 'high end' wire brands - this stuff works great."
4,"Often funny, good CD.","A few good songs on this Cd, including the Primative Radio Gods' good song. Jim Carrey's skits and song- Somebody to Love are funny. Good alternative songs aand overall, a pretty good soundtrack."
3,"Typical, but good soundtrack.","It's not the best thing I ever heard, but it is a collection of good bands. The biggest songs off this would be ""The Primitive Radio Gods"" one hit, and ""Hey Man Nice Shot"" from ""Filter"". Besides those, the tracks from ""Silverchair"" and ""Cypress Hill"" are both good, ""Satellite Of Love"" and ""Oh Sweet Nuthin'"" are old ""Lou Reed/Velvet Underground"" songs, and ""Leave Me Alone"" sounds alot like ""Alice In Chains"", which of course ""Jerry Cantrell"" was in. Also for those wanting a taste of the movie, ""Jim Carrey"" dialogue opens and closes the cd, and he does a crazy cover of ""Somebody To Love"" as well. The best thing about this soundtrack though, is that you could now probably find it in any used cd store for almost nothing."
3,Song?,Does anyone know the name of the song playing the background when Jim Carrey is telling Mathew Broderick to watch Sleepless in Seattle because the ladies love it? Its been bother me ever since the movie came out!
1,I wonder...,"I have to wonder why they chose not to include the great Dinah Washington song that opens the movie? I would have boutght the soundtrack just for that tune, but...Oh, by the way...lousy movie!"
1,Not an extraordinary book,"This edited book appears to be a compilation of speeches -- though it may not be. It's great weaknesses are that it covers a very wide terrain and so the coverage is skimpy; also there is no counterpoint to the write-ups that often appear like propoganda. Political writers have their thinly disguised political agendas -- this shows. The book lectures too much. On the plus side, it provides a nice array of political figures and names -- but unfortunately they really do not say anything new."

2,Misleading labelling of product,"I had previously purchased these cookies at Homegoods for $3.99 a box. Therefore, when I decided to buy these cookies, the title of the item stated ""Pack of 6"", I thought I was getting 6 boxes for $24, not $24 per box!!! I would never pay that much for a tiny box of cookies no matter how good they are. This was very misleading, esp. since I paid alot less for these cookies elsewhere. I kept them because it was too much trouble to return."
4,Not really a true chocolate chip cookie...,"Are these cookies tasty? Definitely YES. They are very very good, which is why I gave them 4 stars. The only reason I deduct 1 star was because they are more like shortbread with mini chocolate chips rather than a traditional chocolate chip cookie. Beware though... These cookies are addictive. They aren't too sweet, which was a pleasant surprise."
2,Near Pointless...,"This guide just really isn't worth buying. Anyone who likes Yu-Gi-Oh and wants to learn the rules can just read the instruction manual that comes in a starter deck. It covers everything you need to know. I mean, yeah I'm sure the guide covers maybe a few things that aren't in the manual, thats why I gave it a 2 and not a 1. But those things are only really useful to know if you are some sort of crazy fanatic who spends thousands of dollars on cards. My advice: buy a starter deck, read the booklet a few times and you'll understand the game fine. Also, Magic is better than Yu-Gi-Oh! Ha-Ha! I said it!"
1,Speaker did not work with my dvd player 5.1 ch,This is my first home theater speaker.It did not work with the dvd player -cyberhome when i wired it the first time as tld in the manual.I am probing further options-rama
4,Excellent resource for the serious figure modeler,"If you're a novice looking for a step-by-step how-to book, keep looking. This volume is for the modeler who already has some experience with building and painting kits, but perhaps hasn't yet worked with human figures much. There are handy tips here, it's just that the emphasis is on customizing figures and creating a backdrop for them. Armstrong is a modeler who places a premium on accuracy, and his comments on achieving the proper detailing for his figures are informative and reveal the broader educational opportunities inherent in this hobby. There is also a helpful bibliography included. As far as modeling itself, the strength of this book is in the imaginative and ingenious ways in which Armstrong creates convincing, interesting sets for his figures, and for this aspect alone, the book is well worth the price. Highly recommended for the serious enthusiast."
3,on modelling large scale medieval figures,"This book uses the author's own production metal figures as the basis for the modelling projects. Thus, the models are generally of 80mm scale, not the more common 54mm scale. The techniques used are not universally applicable, being limited to modelling mail armor, basic drapery and general modification of the commercially available figures. There are only simple references to heraldry, with painting techniques being supplemented by the author's own commercial range of waterslide transfers. The diorama techniques are also superficial, again being more suitable as a backdrop to showcase the finished models. The finished models appear static and are not particularly appealing."
5,GNOSTICISM 101,"This is by far the best introduction to pre-christian theology, gnosticism, et al, that I've seen. It sets the stage for those who understand the dynamics of the drama which inevitably follows..."
3,A good start,"A handy resource for when you're trying to remember the difference between the Docetist and Manichaean heresies, but it's really only a starting point. The articles, like the book, tend toward brevity except in a few major areas, such as Witchcraft or the Inquisition. Also, this compilation focuses almost exclusively on heresy from the point of view of the Roman Catholic Church prior to the Reformation, with some information given on overlapping topics, such as the Protestant adoption (in some areas) of theThe Malleus Maleficarumin the persecution of alleged witches. It nevertheless remains a good basic Who's Who of Gnostic and unorthodox religious thought from the Neoplatonists up to the earliest Protestants and their progenitors, and for that reason I will continue to keep it close by."
3,Spellsinger: Book 1,"Typically Alan Dean Foster. Sometimes funny, at others introspective or fey, but always a good read. As always more than wot"
3,The start of a little too much,"Let me start by saying that I actually rather like Spellsinger as an individual book. Most of what other people have said about it is true. My major objection is that it led me into a series that lasted far too long before I gave up on it - and I got nowhere near through the series. If you can read one book of a series and leave it at that, then go ahead and read Spellsinger, it's an entertaining funny read with great characters. On the other hand if you're like me, and tend to want to read all of a series, even if it goes downhill, don't get started with this one."
4,Great Series...Terrible Price!,"I remember buying all of these books when they came out years ago. It is a really good series but I can't believe they want full price for a series as old as this one. As noted in an earlier review, you can find these books fairly easily in used bookstores for $1-$3. That being said, if you like talking animals, weird characters, amazing magic and great storytelling then you will enjoy the series!"
4,One of the best books written in this genre,"The Spellsinger is the best of the series. It has all the things that make a great fantasy novel: the battle of good against evil, an unwilling hero who reaches within himself for his inner strength to overcome great adversity, lots of twists and turn before the conflict is finally resolved. What makes the Spellsinger different is Foster's use of common things (music, talking animals) to achieve these goals. I got the sense that the author has put a lot of himself into the main character of Jon Tom. The animals, as humans in animal form, have great personalities. There's none of the Disney cuteness about these creatures and that gives this book the spice it needs to keep it from becoming too contrived or too precious. I read this book when it first came out years ago and I re-read it periodically and recommend it to my friends. While The Spellsinger and all it's sequels will never be accused of being great ""literachoor"", you will enjoy reading it."
2,False Alarms,"I bought this alarm a couple years back and it worked fine, until now. We were eating dinner and bam, the alarm goes off. No big deal, maybe we burned some toast. I take it off, and later that night it goes off again. I bring another detector to see if there really is smoke, nothing. Now it goes off no matter where I am, just seconds after I install the battery. The thing is worthless, and all it did was hang on the wall for 2 years. I would NOT buy this again."
4,Really Good Book,"Cool Pose is an excellent book. It addresses the word ""cool"" and how it plays a major part in the mind of afro-american men. I commend the authors for dealing with the issue of coolness because it is a term that has great relevance in the minds of young afro-american men( unfortunately older men too), yet no one has discussed it in great depth. Read this book...and it discusses other topics as well."
2,tsk tsk Tsk,"The authors are just trying to make money....This is a crock of what makes grass green. However, when someone spends time with Afrakan descended youth and understand our story vs his tory..then we can then understand the book by entitled ..Leaving America by RandaLL ROBINSON AND CEASE TO CALL AFRAKANS BLACK"
3,Punisher T-Shirt,The T-Shirt is fine. Good quality and so on. But is not a baby T-Shirt that it is was i look for.
2,WASTED MY MONEY,"PURCHASED 11/25/2011 .DOESNT WORK. I HAVE HAD SEVERAL OF THESE WORKED FINE. I TRIED 2 DIFFERENT AIR PUMPS, DIFFERENT HOSE. LEVELED IT, BLEW THRU IT..ONLY ABOUT 4 "" OF IT WORKS. BOUGHT IT ON AMAZON. WASTED MY MONEY.HI AS OF JANUARY 2012 IT IS WORKING BETTER ABOUT HALF OF WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO. I THINK THE PRODUCT SHIPPED TO ME FROM OZBO ON AMAZON MAY HAVE BEEN VERY OLD OR DEFECTIVE. I HAVE HAD MANY OF THESE ITEMS BEFORE AND NEVER HAD THIS PROBLEM."
3,Rising Damp,This was disappointing. I really liked Leonard Rossiter in The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin so I bought this one. It was no where near Fall and Rise.
1,How awful this game really is.,"This is the worst game, don't even think of buying it unless you're a total ""Dungeons and Dragon's"" [lover]. It stinks, don't buy it."
4,"Fun, yet complicated","When I bought this I thought it would be just like the demo, but it is suprisingly different. It had less flaws, but it was far morecomplicated. I was more interested in the legends of Urak but they were alot more hard than the plain old Lords of Magic.It has its ups and downs, but overall, I think I got my money's worth..."
4,I like classics,This is an old favorite that I cannot leave behind even though graphics and sound are dated. Gameplay is quite addicting and guess what? It runs smoothly on Windows XP even though it was created ages ago. Most oldies I like to replay I have to run on my old Windows98 machine that I keep around just for this purpose. But LoM sits comfortably next to Civ4 and Heroes of M&M V on my XP machine.
1,CD scratched/won't load,The CD Case was broken & chipped. The CD itself is so scratched. I can't get it to download on my computer.
4,A great Foundational Game!,"This game was great back when games sucked. If Sierra remade this game and released it now (with added civilization rts properties) for each race (fire giants, wind giants, water people, earth dwarves, ect) it would hold it's own against all of it's current competitors.It has amazing music, art-work, and you can really tell that the makers spent hundreds of hours making sure everything was seamless. Even the one glitch that this game has (the Life Staff glitch) only makes the game more fun. It's an old game, but classic, and with added expansionist features combiningAge of Wonders II: The Wizard's ThroneandSid Meier's Civilization 3 Completewith Lords of Magic, they could have a game that would stand the test of time.HECK! If my Win-7 ran Lords of Magic, I would still play it, because there's just something about the music, the art-work, and the game-play that really pulls you in..."
2,Would be great if it would stop crashing,"I've played this game between 10-20 times and when it kept going it was really fun. ""Chaos"" was usually the one I played but ""Life"" was pretty cool too. The battles were pretty good but the AI wasn't all that great. The different characters and units were pretty cool though.The graphics are so so. They're not terrible but they're not exactly beautiful either.Unfortunately it crashes after a few minutes or hours so I haven't got to the end of the game ever. I've tried it on two different computers, one being way more poweful than the other one and it just won't play completely on either one. If it'd quit that, it'd be great."
2,Not as good as I had hoped,"Lords of Magic looked like a pretty good game when I read the back of the box in the store but I found it to be extremely frustrating when I played it. It seems as though the computer is starting out with many more resources because I could never catch up to my neighbors in terms of units and resources. Waiting times between turns is way too long, as is waiting for a unit to heal. Also the lack of a small map on the bottom of the screen makes it really hard to orient yourself in the bigger picture. Also, the map stays basically the same no matter how many times you play. Sometimes a few things move but basically it's all the same."
2,Not a good buy,I have had my machine for a little over 3 years and it has had numerous problems. It is very difficult to thread. My bobbin casing is always catching the thread and coming out. I have had to fix it many times. Sometimes the machine just doesn't sew right and I have to turn it off for a while and later it is just fine??? It is a very inconsistant machine that has little to no direction from the manual on the problems I encountered. I would spend a little extra and get a better machine.
2,Not the Machine It Should Be,"I bought this machine two years ago. At the time, it was $800 (no, I didn't buy it from Amazon).I have never been able to use the embroidery feature. Set-up is VERY involved. Once set up, I was unable to figure out how to download the design into the machine, so that feature is a bust.As far as sewing, I like the one step buttonhole foot. I DON'T like that the needle down feature has to be tapped every time you stop the machine, so that feature is a bust.The zig-zag feature is not adjustable. I am forced to sew with a wide zig-zag.I use the machine for general sewing, but I really don't like it."
1,you should bring the box but NO came in,"I NEED THE SOFTWARE INSTALLATION CD Without that I can not use, you should bring the box but NO came in, not if I can help with this please, thanks!"
3,Singer sewing machine,"I really like this sewing machine. Is perfect to for me because it will help me to create many things for my home. I thing that the machine is complete, because I can to add some of feet for sewing, quilting, etc. besides I can create many embroideries, I can't spend a lot of money, then the singer CE-100 Futura sewing and embroidery is perfect for me.I really appreciate if you sending me as soon as possible. Thank you."
3,I like this but....,"I like the machine but it did not come with any of the Cd's or Dvd it should have for the embrodery. So I had to have them send another one out, get what's missing from mine and then send an entire machine back. :( I was in a pretty crafty mood this weekend and had plans for stuff but it will have to wait."
1,So upset!!,I received my new machine today and it's missing all the cd's!! Even the installation cd!!I can't even use it! I sure hope I can get it... for free!! I feel like I've been robbed!
5,For a hobbyist it is great!,"This was my very first embroidery machine. It was very easy to learn, it quickly hooked up to my laptop to use the embroidery software or designs I had downloaded. The software that is made for it as an add-on is pretty good at digitizing. For the price you can't go wrong. It does excellent text and embroidery of designs. I've done numerous baby blankets, shirts, bibs, etc. Even changing colors is not a big deal with the manual needle threader. And the software lets you group your colors together before embroidering so that you only have to change each color once during embroidery."
3,Good but Does NOT Include Photo CD,"I like the machine itself, but be aware that your purchase will not include the photo stitch CD and if you are planning on creating your ouwn designs you will be looking at spending more money on a design program. Don't let this discuourage you tough, I bought the photo stitch program and it definately is NOT worth the money I have not even been able to get one stitchable design from it. I recomend buying this macine and getting the embird software which is also available in a free trial version, so you can try it before you buy it. Despite it not meeting my enitial expectations, this machine has been doing very well for me, but you should also be aware tat it has a small flaw that causes it to set off a ssafety alarm saying the thread is broken even if it is not, so you can't exactly just leavve te room and let it run."
2,Very Difficult.,I bought this ready to do a lot of things with it. I haven't been able to sew one thing. You have to use it with the laptop at all times or it will complain with an annoying beep again and again. I tried to sew a light material curtain with it the needle poked at the bobbin holder and now I can never use it again. I have to get it repaired because I am unable to find a replacement part for it where I have looked. Offers a lot of options and I am sure once its repaired if ever I will eventually get to sew one thing.
3,Beeping is loud--machine works great.,"Researched this machine for awhile--you can get it for less other places sometimes, but you just really need to shop around for good deals and offers included.I love this machine. Sews great and the embroidery is great but make sure you follow directions and read the instruction booklet well. I keep mine right next to it. The thing is constanly beeping at me for not puting the presser foot down or this that or the other which would be a nice little feature but the beeping is really loud and annoying."
5,3000+ owners can't be wrong.,"The main difference between all the folks who had problems with this machine and the 3000+ folks that belong to the futuraembroidery group on Yahoo is joining that group. I knew nothing about embroidery but when I saw the price of the Singer Futura I thought that I would try it. I had done hand embroidery and machine sewing but machine embroidery is a totally different skill. Add the challenge of installing and running the software and you definitely need some hand holding. The futuraembroidery group was exactly what I needed to help get me started and now I am confident that I can embroider just about anything. Buy a Futura, find that group and I guarantee you'll be embroidering all your Christmas gifts in no time."
4,A great Learning Machine,"I have owned my Futura CE-100 for six months, and I adore it. It truly is a great machine, once I learned more about machine embroidery, like the importance of proper stabilizers and proper placements of designs. It is an awesome sewing machine too. I make clothing often and I couldn't ask for a better machine.I gave the Futra CE-100 a 4 because it can be frustrating when learning, and the manuals (for machine and software) are lacking info. But the software is okay, you can resize, rotate, add lettering and it opens most every design format available. Design Browser lets you see designs when choosing. Play with the buttons and see what you can do. If you don't save, everything reverts to its orignal size and shape. Seriously consider this machine if you are just into embroidery for fun.2012 and I still have this machine! It has held up amazingly well."
4,Nice Little machine!,"I was intimidated after ordering the Machine and THEN reading the reviews here on Amazon.....but so far so good....As far as the embroidery goes, if you take the time and prepare your fabric with good stabalizer, use decent thread and very important ""thread socks"", I dont believe you will have many problems. I can see how the designs can be ruined if you don't take time and prepare the fabric. Sewing is a breeze, and the ""broken thread"" goes away with the tention put on the thread with a little thread sock. Hope this helps~"
5,Review,"I received my package when they said I would, and it is in great condition. I will use this seller again."
2,Not very good vermeil,"After wearing them twice the ""rose gold"" turned gunmetal gray and now the ""yellow gold"" is slowly disappearing."
4,Excellent,"This is lean and ecconomical blues rock from `1970.The great thing about Parish Hall is they know what they want, and stick to this idea. This is twelve bar blues with rock octane guitars and drums. These guys don't have the elegance of Paul Butterfield, the art leanings of Hendrix, the blast of Blue Cheer, or the purity of John Mayall.No expermential tracks, no genre attempts, no gesutres towards 1960s rock expansionism.These guys like the blues and they like to rock and they do both well. Here Here. Hats Off. Play Loud."
4,A Lot of Fun for the Price,"Get ready for hours and hours of stress-inducing fun! This game leads the player from the basics of driving and using the controls of the tank via your joystick under the tutelage of a barking commander, gradually up to incredibly complex campaigns (controlling many allied tanks) that you'll have to play over and over again to win. Our entire family became addicted for months. You'll drive over desert, snow, greenery, and land mines in the various campaigns. You'll have to use judgment concerning whether or not to engage combat and how to best go about it. Call in air support? You decide if and when. If you get blown up, hop into another tank and keep on fighting. The main drawback is that this game does not use a mouse to make selections; the user must use up and down arrows to select. Another irritating factor is that the group of tanks you are commanding sometimes tend to wander off or drive right into you. But all in all, a lot of fun for the price."
2,"Some Good, Some Bad","This is a generally good CD, however, there are alot of songs with just repetitive elements, like words or instruments. My fav song is ""grandlife"" by we in music. So, buy this cd if you REALLY like techno / french techno. otherwise, you will be bored. This is also very good for parties."
4,JIM CARREY'S BEST AND MOST UNDERRATED MOVIE,"A CABLE GUY [JIM CARREY] BECOMES OBSESSED WITH BEING AN ARCHITECT'S [MATTHEW BRODERICK] FRIEND. THIS IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER JIM CARREY MOVIES THAT CAME BEFORE IT. IT'S VERY FUNNY AND IT HAS CLEVER REFERENCES TO TV SHOWS AS WELL. AND THE ACTING IS EVEN GOOD. FOR SOME STUPID REASON, THIS MOVIE TURNED OUT TO BE A DISSAPOINTMENT IN THEATRES. ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY HATED THIS MOVIE IS PROBABLY UPSET WITH THE FACT THAT JIM CARREY IS DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT. BUT, IF YOU LIKE COMEDY FILMS, GIVE THIS ONE A TRY. AND BELIEVE ME, THIS WAS JIM CARREY'S BEST MOVIE. AND MOST OF THE MOVIES HE DID AFTER THIS WERE INFERIOR."
1,the most terrible of carrey's performances,it was a stupid pointless movie that I would never want to see again.I reccomend that you do not watch it.
1,I think the director has been smoking crack!,"I'm not joking! this movie is so dumb. What is the point. How about the plot? If you want to learn what happens to you if you smoke crack, watch this movie. It is about some guy who works on cable. That is all I can say. I didn't understand this movie at all. He was a wakko guy obsessed with tv. Wow! that certainly was a big hit, NOT! If you have money to burn, and need to know what you might end up like if you take drugs, Watch this movie."
5,See the master at the top of his game.,Jim Carrey is a comedic god. It is one of few performances that can be compared to Michael Richard's Kramer. This movie has 3 or 4 scenes that will have you laughing through tears. The last fifteen minutes or so is not very funny.
5,Love it,"First off Jim Carrey is a GREAT actor. Funny and worth watching. I always look forward to watching this movie. Chip ,Jim, grew up a lonely boy. Living his life watching tv and always wanting a friend to play with. Chip grows up to be a cable guy. But he gets fired from all of his jobs because he try's too hard to be friends with everyone. I don't want to spoil this movie for those who have not seen it. All I have to say is this movie is a must watch movie!!!!"
5,Many Laughs,"This movie rocks. I love that Jim Carrey is the demented Cable Guy. Jim Carrey ( up till this movie) was only known for 'wacky' - goofy comedy. And this movie is leaps and bounds above that crap. If you want lame - childish - Pet Ventura junk then stay away. But if you can appreciate smart humor and good writing then this is a blast. The whole concept of Cable Guy is based on a man who will do anything to be liked - even though everything he does is over the top and annoying. The two scenes that always kill me: 1) he dresses up like Freddie Mercury and beats up Owen Wilson in the bathroom. 2) He mauls the dude in the basketball game in slo-mo, then eventually dunks the ball and breaks the glass after hanging on the rim and falls STRAIGHT down."
3,It deserved the credit it got,"I didn't like this movie. It wasn't really that funny, and it was just too dark many times to be a good comedy. Jim Carrey's talent was squandered and he came off as a loser, rather than a comedian. He did an excellent job with his character, but in the end it was just a boring movie that could have stood for a makeover. Ben Stiller's a funny guy, but it sort of fell flat here."
5,Missunderstood,"In my opinion this is one Jim Carrey's greatest acheivments, but was missunderstood by the public. In this dark comedy a psycotic cable installer Chip Douglas wishes to befriend his most recent custom Steven Kovacs, played by Matthew Brodderick. The problem is Chip Douglas, played by Jim Carey, was raised by the Television and in his life television and reallity have merged with each other, causing him to have a very warped view of freindship. As you get further into the movie the actions of Chip Douglas become increasingly disturbing, but at the same time funny. This comedy is not for all but if you are a Jim Carey fan and like different commedies then this is the movie for you."
5,I liked it!!!,"This movie was a hell of alot better than any other of Carrey's movies, Ace Ventura was the most wasted hour and an half in my life. ""The Cable Guy"" over all is a very wierd movie. With psycho path cable-installer Carrey. One of my favorite parts is when he beats the living sh#t out of that guy Robin was dating. I loved Stiller in ""Heavyweights"" and his directon in ""The Cable Guy"" was excellent. The movie and televison spoofs are all also excellent. The part where he sends Stephen 2 jail was so messed up. I like when he first gets in and that black guy goes, ""I be yo friend"". Great movie."
2,Jim Carrey at his worst,"After the Mask, Ace Ventura, and Bruce Almighty I didn't think Carrey was capable of doing a bad movie, but after thoughtlessly renting this movie I was prooven wrong. Carrey plays a psycho phony cable guy with a terrible lisp and does his usual routine of acting like a complete screwball, but this time it just wasn't funny. Because of dry dialogue and script and co-stars such as Matthew Broderick who only belong in serious movies this movie just bored me, and when it was done I felt kind of depressed having spent an hour and a half watching this monstrosity. Carrey fans steer clear of this dissapointment."
2,Screwball comedy for screwballs,"Watched the movie on maaawwhaaww.. cable ~What I can note, for the film's, punchline, premise is ~Matthew borderick's character is a,""on the ropes"" ~ romantically, lonely guy ~Then enters cable guy (resourceful, lonely guy period,with a speech impediment)~ they supposedly befriend one-another ~Cable dude eventually helps to restore thearchitect's relationship w/ his cheating bride to be ~So matthew does a rat, w/ the cable guy ~Now, Mr. Romance, no longer has time ~ no time ?to spend w/ his friendship ~Was loyality/friendship being ""demonized"" ~& exploitation being commended w/ this movie?Maybe Mr.Romance's humilation was poetic justiceFeel free to reply ~ about it's philosophic side ~I'm kinda lost w/ this 1 ~"
3,SoSo,"Carrey has good moments offset with bad onesGood: The whole Medieval Times sketchBad: The karaoke partyGood: The basketball gameBad: The endingBen Stiller's style of comedy mars the movie. For instance, the whole subplot of Menendez-style brothers is insipid. It'd've been funnier to do a OJ-media-hype parody. What's so funny about the Menendez brothers?Loved Garafaolo & the comedian who played the king at Medieval Times, and I think Broderick is a natural at dark comedy (see Election). I loved Carrey on Living Color, Ace Ventura & Dumb n Dumber - he's a broad comic, not an actor, and certainly not able to carry dark comedy."
1,Incorrect aspect ratio listed,"Amazon's listed aspect ratio is 2.35:1 anamorphic. However, the aspect ratio shown on the back of the DVD case is 1.33:1."
1,Bad,"I remember seeing this movie in theaters. I also remember forcing myself to laugh at the humorless jokes so that I would not feel that I wasted my money on the ticket. The entire theater was silent with the exception of a few chuckles. Now, call me crazy, but I think that means this movie stinks."
3,"not bad, but definitely worth it for one scene","I saw this at a friend's house, not being a huge fan of Jim Carrey or his work. The movie went along as usual, mildly funny, until Chip and Steve (Carrey and Broderick) went to Medieval Times- there is the highlight of the movie! That whole scene was just a scream. Absolutely inspired! I laughed so hard during the Medieval Times scene - it is so hilarious - in my opinion probably one of the funniest movie scenes ever (and not in your typical grossout Jim Carrey way) and I was so surprised to find such a comedy jewel stuck in the middle of this semi-unknown movie. I own this video, but I usually only watch the Medieveal Times scene - it is worth buying the video for, but that's about it. Still, if you haven't seen it, the jousting scene had me rolling on the floor in tears, it is just tooo funny! Feel free to memorize the dialog and sprinkle it liberally through your conversations. Thanks to ye, fair wench!"
3,ugly comedy,"Some people call this ""dark comedy"": I call it ugly.Certain types psychopathic personalities prey on others,the worst being mass murderers.Here we have an individual who craves a brother or a friendand as a result just messes up the lives of people he tries to get close to.This guy is toast in the brain:totally twisted toast.I winched at each new fantastic development.Since I know an individualwho is very like this and very self-destructivethe movie wasn't fun for me.Jim Carey's comedy acting was great: better than the movie plot deserved."
1,completely wrong,"I bought about 15 movies all together and everything was fine until I reached the cableguy dvd. I always buy new and from amazon. This dvd was completely used, there was zero packaging on this dvd the disc was completely scratched to s***, and there was even a bunch of dog hair in the jewel case, really weird, pissed because it will cost more to ship this product back than its worth, very disappointing!!!"
2,Not Jim Carrey's Best,"I would try renting this first or maybe finding it on TV. If your a true Carrey fan like me,you won't find Jim Carrey acting like he did in The Mask,Ace Ventura,Bruce Almighty,or any other of his good ones. Just drop this one from the list."
2,CABLE GUY Review,"""Stupid Cable Guy! Nearly ruined Jim Carrey's career"". Uh, Homer Simpson summed it up so appropriately there. Okay, maybe I'm being a bit too harsh. In all fairness, this was not a bad movie. But for someone like Jim Carrey who had been well-known for his goofball comedies like ""Ace Ventura"" and ""Dumb And Dumber"", this dark comedy was a bit too much, too fast for his usual audience. Throw in Matthew Broderick who hasn't been in a good movie since he ditched high school for a day in ""Ferris Bueller's Day-Off"" and you have the formula for a box-office disaster."
2,The Cable Guy,"It has its few good moments in the movie, but the plot was just too bad. This should definitely be known as one of Jim Carrey's worst films."
4,A must-have for Jim Carrey fans!,"It's no ground-breaking movie. The Cable Guy, however, is absolutely hilarious. Jim Carrey plays a demented cable guy who installs cable for free to Matthew Broderick. At first, Broderick thinks this is great until he realizes this new friend of his is completely nuts and overly intrusive in his personal affairs. As you may have guessed, Carrey is a riot in this. One of my favorite parts is when Carrey puts Broderick on hold on the phone, only he's not really on hold. I use this trick at work all the time. If you've ever had a ""friend"" who borders more on stalker than true friend, this movie is for you. And even if not, you'll find plenty to laugh about in this silly little flick. Enjoy!"
4,Great flick!,"I can't believe that the critics hated this movie. In my humble opinion, this is one of Carrey's best acting roles.You'll love the basketball game scene. I could barely control my laughter when Carrey drove to the basket and dunked after jumping onto another player's back. Carrey then uttered the classic line ""I've never done a slam dunk before. Thanks for the boost.""You'll also love the bathroom scene. I don't want to spoil it for you right here.In short, the movie is funny, the acting is great, and the story really flows (except for the ending). The casual viewer will empathize for Chip Douglas (Carrey) by the end of the movie."
2,Very sad!! :(,"Looked forever for bagpipes should have kept looking. they would look good on a shelf, but for a child to start learning not so much. Bag does not hold air very disappointing. save your $70 an keep looking. Amazon was great however, fast service an easy to navagate."
2,just a chanter,i was hoping for some sort of beginners bagpipes but this is just a chanter with a bag and fake drones and very small
2,Amazon: Children's bagpipes not what expected at all! Don't buy.,"Children's bagpipes not at all what expected!! Photo looks impressive and read that they were to be functionable, however, were not in the least functionable for an adult, much less for a child. Mouth piece would not sit properly and fell out immediately repeatedly ... could go on and on. This was a holiday gift for my grandchild, age 9, and both of us were very disappointed. This was my first time shopping on Amazon and I am hesitant to do so again."
3,Great for kids,My son loved his chair. Warning though: don't let your husband sit in it or it may break. We have to get him a new chair now. Otherwise it is a great chair. It was a gift for Christmas so he would have a big chair to sit in to play video games.
5,Really soft !,"I was really pleased with the softness of the sheet set. I always buy children sheet set, but this was the first time that I bougth for myself and I loved it !"
4,Good purchase,"Excellent quality now that it's on blu-ray. Recommend it also for the great music and story.. Came with two disks, one reg. and one blu-ray..."
3,Boy gets grill but how do you use it.,If your looking for a book of recipes this one is fine but if your looking for a book about grilling and grill techniques you better look somewhere else.
2,Too much of a good thing,"I was quite dissapointed in this book, particularly given the hype and the other reviews. While the introduction was well done, I thought a surprising number of the recipes were mayonnaise-based, and that the portions were all over the place. In one recipe, two -2lb pork tenderloins (no waste) feed four people (pg. 144) as does 2 lbs. of ground beef (again no waste; pg. 156) yet in another, two 1 lb. bone-in T-bone steaks feed six people (lots of waste). That seems off. What also seems off are the calories. I noticed that on several of the recipes, by the time you end up figuring in calories for fat and various other caloric ingredients (e.g. avocado, cheese, nuts), you're close to the nutritional analysis calories before you even add the meat (e.g. pgs. 166/67 & 130/31).I guess it's just not my thing!"
1,Healthier if you don't make any of the recipes,"He starts out by telling you in the introduction its not a diet book. I pat of butter is ""heathier"" than using two pats of butter. You can eat the steak, but its ""healthier"" if you only eat half the steak. I think this was a 'healthy' band-wagon book, if you read the recipes, there is nothing healthy about them.I'm not a Bobby Flay fan. I think he puts too many high end ingredients in one recipe and the only thing they add at the end is an increased cost per serving without adding a difference in taste. Too many expensive ingredients, or ingredients period, in a dish, does not make for a better dish. (And, I am a person willing to spend money on ingredients) Overly-complicated without purpose. That is how I describe his cooking style.This is a deceptive book and I got rid of it. There is a library of better grilling books. I highly recommend any of the Weber Grilling Cookbooks."
3,Good but misleading!,"I liked the book but was surprised by the amount of fat in some of the recipes. Although I believe grilling is healthier than pan cooking or frying, I was surprised by the amount of recipes that had nothing to do with grilling. From salads to desserts. I was hoping for more on grilled desserts that are light and fresh off the grill. Liked the book, but was disappointing in many of the recipes and the fat count on alot of the recipes are high!"
4,Another great book by Bobby,"This is a great book for people who like to grill and who also want to eat healthier. The recipes are amazing, they're typical Bobby, full of flavor and bold. I was never a fan of Bobby until I got his ""Bobby Flay Cooks American"" and tried some of his recipes. They were flavorful, mouthwatering and simply wonderful, and this book's recipes are just as good. I gave the book 4 stars only because it has very few photographs. It only has about 6 pages of photographs with about 14 recipes featured in them, even thought the book has 75 recipes. If that doesn't bother you, I'm sure you'll enjoy this book and the great recipes it contains."
4,Excellent book,"This book is very useful for beginner. It teaches you how to use sauces, spices, juices, honey and adding many other flavors on the grill. I bought this book using a coupon from couponsky.com and learned a lot of cooking skills from this book. I recommend this book to everybody who like cooking."
4,"Pioneer's Dub is still good, but isn't as good as original.","As much as I love Fushigi Yuugi, and as great a show it is, I just don't think that the dub carries its original jokes and overall voice acting as well as the original Japanese version. Chichiri's 'no da's were priceless, and it's sad to see them go--although the 'y'know' was pretty clever to add. Overall, I believe that if you can read and watch at the same time, Fushigi Yuugi SUBBED is the way to go. If not, the dub is an okay subsitute. [But I can't stand Miaka's voice!!!] Great plot, storyline, animation, opening and ending theme songs--this show has it all."
5,Great movie for kids and adult. Fun and cute.,"My daughter and I really enjoyed watching these videos ""Mysterious Play"". We had seen all of the episodes except for Priestess of Seiyuu and Dying land. My sister (30) years old watched this too. We all love the story and the characters in it. I recommended this video for all ages, it really fun and cute. I am looking forward for the new releases, it would be interesting to see what is happening next. My daughter can't wait for the new videos releases."
3,Odd even for Woody Allen,"A bit too odd, even for Woody Allen. As always Allen does well helping you feel the human psyche even the dark sides."
5,New York Stories by Woody Allen,Thanks for the wonderful product and service! I am a fan of Woody Allen Films and this is a easy way to complete my collection.
4,"the best, the worst, the kind of mediocre","Scorsese's contribution, Life Lessons, is among his finest works. He manages to rein in his excessive style, and concentrates on character. Terrific performances from Nolte and Arquette.The bad news: Life Without Zoe is without doubt the worst film Coppola has made. A new low for this great director, and for movies in general. So stupid and offensive, one wonders what he was thinking...Oedipus Wrecks is amusing, nothing more.Bottom line: After Life Lessons you can turn the tape off without having missed anything special."
2,"Film 4 Stars, DVD 2","I love this film, but the biggest problem I have is with the aspect ratio. I recently bought the film, not realizing it had been cut to a 1.33:1 from a 1.85:1, and I ultimately feel like if I'm paying for a film, I should own the entire thing.Shame on me for not reviewing the aspect ratio before purchase, but beyond that, it's a great film minus the Coppola dribble in the middle."
5,"NEW YORK STORIES "" LIFE LESSONS"" OF A PAINTER","Nick Nolte's performance in ""Life lessons"" the segment of Martin Scorcesee is unbelievable. As an artist, his prestation in the role of this talented painter let me glue to the coach in front of the T.V.This electric energy. The strokes on the canvas. The way the paintings are shown on screen is magnificent, and the paintings...Who is the painter of the movie, Chuck Connelly? I would like to know more about him, he is a big part of the movie, no? About the other two segment I don't really remember, I just think the segment "" Life lessons"" is REAL ART."
3,Scorcese yes. Coppola and Allen no.,"The Nick Nolte piece about a Soho artist's quixotic fixations with young girls is the best of the three films here. Nice Scorcese rock soundtrack, as usual. The Coppola bit is cartoon-like and not very interesting, though visually arresting. Woody's schtick about the over bearing Jewish mother is quite funny, but short and thin. The directors all try to outdo each other with fancy camera work. Great looks at late 80s NYC."
3,"Life Lessons, the only reason to buy this!","Clearly, one of Scorsese's more powerful works, Life Lessons is the first story of the three in this movie. The other two... you can do without. But once you see Nick Nolte here as the obsessed painter Lionel Dobie, you'll not want to watch the other two again after you have seen them once. I keep watching this 45 minute segment over and over. Powerful... and cheap!"
2,Its gets progressevly more boring until it dies.,"This movie starts off blazing hot and ends up ice cold. Martin does a great job with Nick Nolte as an artist in ""life lessons"" and i thought after this story that i was in for a real treat of a film but after watching Ford Coppolas somthing Zoe i began to tire and by the end of Woody Allens snoozefest i was bored stiff. My advice is to watch the first 30 minutes and then turn this one off. The first 30 minutes is GREAT film followed but very average film and ending with truley awful film."
2,Don't Throw Out Your Old Joy!,"With his new edition of the Joy, Ethan Becker betrays the tradition of his mother and grandmother who wrote the original Joy. As loyal readers of the original editions know, Irma Rombauer (Ethan's grandmother) and Marion Rombauer Becker (Ethan's mother) added to a select few recipes the word ""Cockaigne,"" to indicate their favorites. Ethan has distorted this trusted symbol. For instance, in the old Joy there was a recipe called ""Devil's Food Cake Cockaigne."" Under the title were the words ""The best chocolate cake we know."" The new Joy also has a recipe called ""Devil's Food Cake Cockaigne."" However, the recipe is for a completely different cake. Other Cockaigne recipes from the old edition, such as ""Apple, Peach or Plum Cake Cockaigne"" (which I use to make plum cake every Rosh Hashana to rave reviews) are simply gone. In short, Ethan Becker should have written his own cookbook instead of ""revising"" out of recognition an old and trusted friend."
3,"Good - But Keep the Old ""Joy""","The new JOY provides a needed update to the old classic to address the many changes in food trends over the past 30 years. That said, it does omit many of the treasured recipes of the old JOY. I like the new emphasis on healthier ingredients and new classics, but miss some of the old recipes that have become family favorites. I don't think it hurt the new edition to lose some of the old text that has become obsolete (like how to butcher your own animals, although that was entertaining to read). I have to add that my copy of the new JOY was incorrectly bound, with pages missing and out of order - it must have happened at the printer. But I have found some great new recipes in the new book. My advice is to think of this book as a companion to the old JOY, not a replacement."
2,Maybe if they changed the format ...,"How much easier these recipes would be to read if they would list all the ingredients and their quantities at the BEGINNING of each recipe, rather than sprinkling them through. The classic JOY is the same format, I realize. Sometimes tradition needs to be rethought. This is one of those times."
4,An absolute must for your cooking library,"After years of cooking, I borrowed this edition for a friend and was horrified that I had never considered adding this to my collection. It contains every essential recipe you might ever need, and suggestions for what to do with that remaining vegetable on hand. I compared to the most recent edition and found it was missing the little pep this version containsThe only drawback: it is hard for me to follow the ingredients format. I know it's the style and it does prompt me to read the recipe in it's entirety but years of seeing the ingredients first are hard to cast aside. I don't skim through recipes like with other books. Nonetheless, this is here to stay, with pleasure."
2,not so joyful cooking,"Not what i wanted, but hate returning products will work with this even if a lot of things are missing in this version. Wanted the 1974 book but received the 1997 revised version."
2,Hard on the eyes; a chore to read during preparation,"I am still using the edition I bought before I was married (the 1951 edition of the one copyrighted in 1931 by the original publisher, Bobbs-Merrill. In fact this is my second copy of the same book; the first succumbed to constant use over 40 years. Although the new edition has more and currently fashionable recipes, the book is visually unappealing and hard to read. In my original version, the recipe titles and ingredients are in such bold type that they leap up at you. It's a good book to read and perhaps find some especially tempting recipes, but for everyday usefulness, this new one is no replacement for the older edition."
2,"Where's the ""Joy""??","I received this edition as a gift from my sister. I suspected the new version would be inferior to the last and so far, my suspicions were correct. The recipes are just, well, off. Too salty, too bland, or, in regard to baked goods, either too sweet or not sweet enough. I haven't found a recipe yet that wouldn't be better without some significant adjusting, making this version just another average cookbook. From what others have written, it seems this latest edition is no match for earlier versions. I will be combing used bookstores for a different version."
2,Hard on the eyes; a chore to read during meal preparation,"I am still using the edition I bought before I was married (the 1951 edition of the one copyrighted in 1931 by the original publisher, Bobbs-Merrill). In fact this is my second copy of the same book; the first succumbed to constant use over 40 years. Although the new edition has more and currently fashionable recipes, the book is visually unappealing and hard to read. In my original version, the recipe titles and ingredients are in such bold type that they leap up at you. This new edition is a good book to read and perhaps find some especially tempting recipes, but for everyday usefulness, it is no replacement for the older edition. If you love your old Joy, hang on to it!"
2,"well, i will not return it","growing up with no less than eight chefs, and several cooks, in the family you learn to appreciate little things. they are, perhaps, best summed up by the term 'care.' care is lacking in this volume. some omissions are noticable. better sources exist for the 'newer' cooking tools and methods, though they do not attempt to include (some) of the classics. the presentation of the text is difficult to use if you are actively consulting it while cooking, as opposed to making your own working copy of the receipe or using it as a starting point. i suspect most users intend to have it open & in use. keep it for reference if you get a copy of it, but use the older edition which is still available. otherwise hope that the spiral edition (when it comes out), or the next printing, corrects the format/style errors. even then, use the old one first. it is more carefully done. despite the title, the reader will not receive more joy from this cookbook."
3,I'll stick with Better Homes and Garden,I received this cookbook for Christmas and I wasn't too thrilled with it. It seemed a little too old fashioned and the recipes did not inspire me.
5,An excellent cookbook for beginners!!!,I just recently started to take an interest in cooking and JOC has been a great reference for ideas and basics with cooking several different meals.
5,Terrific resource for cooks who like variety,"My friends and family tell me I am a gourmet cook. I wouldn't go that far, but I do consider my kitchen my natural habitat. So, when I find a cookbook I like, I really use it. This book is the most used book in my collection. I have given it as a gift to cooks of varying skills -- all enjoy it. The directions are clear. I especially like the narrative sections relating to specific ingredients and cooking methods. If I could have only one cookbook, this would be it."
1,Give me the old Joy!!,"I learned to cook with the old 1964 Joy of Cooking, and still consult it regularly. I looked forward to the new one, and bought it for my son, promising him that if he would read it he could perform wonders in the kitchen. Then I spent some time with it. Give me the old Devil's Food cake cockaigne! etc., etc. Marion Becker and her mother would be horrified by this new book. Thank goodness I found an old one at a garage sale for my son."
3,Stay away from the CD-ROM,"Stay away from the CD-ROM edition of The Joy of Cooking. It's a technological disaster.It doesn't run on many PC's and it's dead slow even on high-end PC's.Simon & Schuster offer no support for this. Their web site doesn't even list TJOC CD-ROM and tech support offers no help.Given the popularity of The Joy of Cooking this could have been a great product.Better yet, this could have been a Great Web Site -- Anyone listening?The CD is just a technological disaster."
3,"Good recipes, bad organization","I was excited to own this ccokbook since I had heard the original was a must have for any cook. Never having seen the original though, I had no comparison. Every recipe I have tried over the last several months, has come out great. The recipes are very easy to follow and I have not been disappointed in the outcomes. However, this cookbook is not organized well at all. It is difficult to understand why the recipes are sometimes organized in an unusual way. Also the book is lacking in desciptions and illustrations of techiniques that would be helpful, especially to beginners. I would recommend this book for the recipes, but not as the ""be all, end all"" of the essentials of cooking."
3,The sadness of shoddiness.,"Shoddy, shoddy construction. Our now over 28 year old copy of ""JOY"" has been used three or four times a week, and lugged abroad for many stays. It still holds together and is in very good shape. The new version, less than a year old, is falling apart -- pages are falling out and the spine is cracked. It will not last another year. Shameful! And it is not used nearly so often -- the whole feeling is that the book is intended less for people that actually cook, than for people who dabble."
1,disappointment with new version,"My mother was given a Joy of Cooking cookbook one year as a Christmas present. I absolutely loved it! It had unusual recipes for making such things as butter, sauerkraut, cooking porcupines, etc. (Not that I did all those things.) I do have a vegetable garden and raise my own cabbage and make my own sauerkraut every year. The New Joy of Cooking didn't have the ratio of salt to cabbage for sauerkraut. Additionally, the new version does not have nearly the amount of ""scratch"" recipes the older version has. Honestly, I am seriously considering using the book as a footrest, or as the base for starting my heating stove. I am definitely not pleased with this version at all."
2,"Too Inaccessible, Better Homes and Gardens a Better Choice","Every time I open this book I feel like I'm reading some fat religious text with tiny print. It may have very good advice but i could never get through the thing, or event get started. If you are looking for a basic, all purpose cook book that is easily accessible, get the Better Homes and Gardens cook book. It clearly explains techniques and recipes in an easily navigated format with plenty of pictures. I read it cover to cover with a great improvement in my cooking ability as a teenager. Now I have a little more experience, I find it a handy reference. Joy of cooking is not as beginner friendly and is less clearly organized. It maybe a standard, but not intuitive enough for me."
5,Great Book,"I have used Joy of Cooking for many years and just purchased my forth one as another gift. It seems to be the best 'Joy' edition, as the 75th anniversary one seems to have several mistakes."
2,BORING,"Such a boring cookbook!! I like color and pictures to give a hint as to what to expect from a cookbook. This one has sparse skethings of a shallot or some other food. Although it has good info describing the numerous fruits and veggies out there, it wasn't worth the money. And all the recipes I have tried so far have been bland! Stick with a Betty Crocker for a basic cookbook."
1,same cookbook just reprinted,buy one on half for seventy five cents and kill the vanity. The gift recipient never said thank you.
2,By Any Other Name ... Would Be A Better Idea,"""Joy of Cooking"" is a wonderful cookbook that belongs in every kitchen (and if you can afford or want a second, then get ""Pirates's Pantry"").Unfortunately, this is not that book.If this had a different name -- a title that did not include the words ""joy of cooking"", i'd give it one or even two more stars. But this is *not* the book that i grew up with in my mother's and my grandmother's kitchens, and that i have already worn out a copy of myself, and it loses a star or so for attempting to claim it is a mere ""revision"" of that honourable book.Not a bad book, really, but not essential, unlike its predecessor, the *true* ""Joy""."
2,A far cry from the old classic favorite!,"I was so disappointed in this version! I have a ""Joy"" from the mid-1950s and one from the early 1980s -- I would chose either old one over this one any day. The print is terrible and the tone is smug and elitist. It doesn't act as a foundation for cooks -- it assumes you already know everything! PLUS, despite my not using it very often, the binding came apart and pages came out (after less than two years.) Find an old ""Joy"" on ebay and you'll be happier!"
2,New Joy of Cooking is definitely not The Joy of Cooking,"A couple of the reviews for this book are referring to the original Joy of Cooking, not the New Joy of Cooking found on this page. I find the Joy of Cooking to be an outstanding reference for the kitchen. Excellent index, outstanding articles about different ingredients and techniques, very diverse and and concise recipes. The New Joy of Cooking on the other hand has none of these attributes. It is a poor imitation of it's predecessors and should not bear the name Joy of Cooking.The recipes are limited in scope, the index is difficult to use, and many of the articles are not nearly as complete and concise as in the original. I would recommend skipping the New Joy and getting a copy of the original."
2,"Buy the prior edition, not this one","They try to cover every food trend which has evolved since the 1972 edition in the same number of pages. Can't be done. You get lots of information about food and ingredients, but not many recipies. Stick to the 1972 version,"
1,What a disappointment!,"Like so many others, I rushed to the bookstore to get the new Joy. In our household, all how-to cooking and recipe discussions are settled by saying, ""Let's ask Joy."" Unfortunately, the organization, typeface, hodge podge style of the new Joy makes it truly unworkable. If ever a book suffered by being written by a committee, this is it. I'll be sticking with my old version."
2,THE politically correct cookbook!,"This has always been my favorite, basic cookbook of American food. It has been turned into a hodge podge of Foods of All Nations. I don't know where I could shop to find the goat meat or thai spices that are often called for. Hold on tightly to your old Joys or order a new copy of the older edtion now -- before they stop publishing it."
2,changed for the worse,I've used my old copy of JOC for years and practically taught myself how to cook from it. I was going to get copies for my friends who are cooking impaired and who think I'm a cooking goddess. I still will but not the new version. It now requires thermometers and much more useless fussing than the old one. Get the older version. It's the one that you want.
2,Definitly not user-friendly,"My mother read the cover off her copy of the Joy of Cooking. My copy sits on the shelf and gathers dust. Compared to classics like the Fanny Farmer cookbook, this one just doesn't cut the mustard. There is a ton of information crammed into the book, actually too much. A few graphics and a little white space would go a long way in making Joy easier to read and follow."
4,You Can Always Find the Recipe in Here!,"My mom had an older edition of this cookbook that I always used when I lived at home. I was so happy to get my own when I bought my first home. I bought the spiral bound book, and it is helpful to be able to layout the cookbook instead of having to keep finding my page/recipe. This cookbook will give lots of ideas for different meats, vegetables, breads and more."
2,The 'Bible' turned into microwave cliff notes,"While I have dozens of cookbooks with exotic recipes, I've always relied on 'Joy' for those basics (like canning, preserving, freezing, substituting) and tips you can't find anywhere else. Sure, the new 'Joy' has discovered the food processor and microwave, but has discarded many of those tried and true basics along the way. If you want to replace your worn out, dog earred old copy, get the regular 'Joy', not the new, 'enhanced' one."
3,"Agreed: not the old one, but not horrible either.","I was lucky enough to keep my old, splattered, grimy Joy that is in five pieces, handed down from mother to daughter to friend. I'm glad I did, because the chocolate sauce recipe for ""the kind of sauce that hardens on ice cream"" is not in the new one.(Neither is a recipe for good, crispy roast potatos, but I've tried others instead.)I won't be able to find out how to clean a deer in this version, but I *might* be able to learn how to make a good, spicy Cuban-style pork sandwich. And that's okay by me."
4,Essential but not what it was back in the day,"""Stay in your own movie"" was a phrase Ken Kesey used, and the authors of this edition would have done well to heed that advice. There's plenty of useful information in this book, but I think they'd have done better to stick to updating the older edition rather than trying to encompass areas that just aren't always that useful to Mr. and Mrs. Get-Dinner-On-The-Table. It's a good cookbook and it's worth buying, but it's not as formidable as its predecessors -- it's significantly less, it's a step in the wrong direction. There's good information here, but it's not as focused as it might have been."
3,I just don't get it,"I have tried ever so hard to get into the Joy of Cooking. I really have. Like 3 editions worth on my shelf. I just can't seem to. I really think it is my poor eyesight combined with the truly ugly layout of the text. I know that is not fair at all, but if I can't read it, I can't cook from it, or enjoy it. Please consider re-typesetting this or something.... back to The Fannie Farmer Cookbook for me...."
1,disappointing,"I hate this book. It won't stay open. The recipes don't stand out as separate entities so you can glance at the page and see the next step or ingredient--you have to stop and put your finger on the page and read it and for the next step you have to stop and read again. Over and over. Worse, my results made the kids stare dolefully at their plates.I got an earlier version as a wedding present, and learned a lot from it. What I finally did with this one was show my son how to fold the pages, tape the front cover to the back cover, and spray paint the thing gold to make a Christmas tree."
5,excellent,"i have been using the joy of cooking book for several years and it is an integral part of my culinary education. it serves not only as a foundation for basic recipes but the illustrations of utensils, measurements, and the how-to methods are very helpful."
1,This book will not be around for my daughters 30 anniversary,"In 1970 my first wedding gift was a copy of ""Joy of cooking"" from a loving aunt. I still use this book today while living and cooking in France. Over the years I have given this book to many young brides including my daughter. But I have to say that only after a few years of light use, the binding has come off and the pages are falling out. Because of this, it is difficult to use and to rate it's context. I wonder if others have had this problem? I am going to write to the publisher."
2,Throws baby out with bathwater!!,"I have 4 editions of the Joy: one from the 40's, one from the 50's; the 75 edition, and this one. The 50's & 75 eds are improvements on the original; they retain most of the best recipes, while updating certain sections and techniques. Not so with the ""new"" edition! Fewer than half of the original recipes are retained, and whole sections (Canning, Game) have been eliminated. While some of the new recipes are good, and the expanded vegetarian offerings are nice, this is no longer the Joy of Cooking that I've known and loved since I first learned to cook. All in all, disappointing."
2,what happened to the basics?,"Can you believe that Joy of Cooking does not even have a recipe for beef stew???? If you have an ox tail handy, you are in luck. The introduction was incredibly pompous. The entire tone of this book turned me off, and when I found that I could not even find simple recipes for simple foods, I stopped looking."
3,Don't throw away your old Joy,"I was really disappointed in the new Joy. I don't know what I expected in the new revision anyway, since I really love and use my old Joy. The old one I received as a wedding gift is my trusted friend in the kitchen--it's like having grandma around all the time to answer questions. The new Joy has good vegetarian and ethnic recipies which are nice, but just reading it is a drag. It lacks the personality, emotion and a sense of humor that I enjoy in the old Joy."
1,Bring back the Old Edition!,"I was raised on The Joy of Cooking as my Bible for cooking. I was so anxious to receive my new (1997) edition as my 1975 edition was falling apart. To my dismay none of the recipes I depend upon were there, or if they were, were completely altered. Where is the Persimmon pudding? The basic cornbread? The bran muffins(the old version)? Gone. And I detect a trendiness at the cost of taste in the guise of low-fat, etc. (this should be a separate section only). I am now faced with a dilemma of what to do. I only use my 1975 edition but it is falling apart. Will the Joy of Cooking people please reconsider reissuing it? How about renaming this edition as Joy II for those who actually like it? Thanks, Karen in Santa Cruz"
4,"The best standard American cookbook today, but you need the other Joy too!","I like the new Joy. Some of the new recipes are quite good...even better than those in the old Joy.But, as an American expat, I'm glad didn't discard my old Joy. The new Joy is missing important basics like jams and bagels.I have one serious complaint: a basic cookbook like Joy needs a sturdy binding, sturdier than the one it has. After only 5 years, pages are threatening to fall out. (I guess that shows that it gets used!)"
2,Makes a Lovely Bookend,"I originally bought this book to replace my ratty 1964 edition of ""The Joy."" Today, I ordered the 1975 edition instead, and I recommend that others do, too. Some of us here in the Midwest are still occasionally faced with cooking a whole sullen pumpkin or dealing with the casualty of a gun-toting uncle's walk in the woods. The ladies Rombauer never let us down. If I want most of the food Becker writes about, I do live near a metro area large enough that I find a ethnic restaurant that cooks it, and better. The Becker book reminds me of the old saying, ""Don't mess with success."""
3,A disappointment,"I have the original JoC, 1943 edition and the Marion Rombauer Becker version that I purchased in 1971 or 72. Both are considerably better than this latest effort, I'm sad to say. This is still a good book for teaching beginning cooks the whys and wherefores of food preparation and ingredients. But if they're interested in baking I'd advise them to ignore the baking sections and go to another cookbook for dessert and bread recipes. I'm a pretty experienced baker, and I suspect that whoever did the cakes, pies, etc. in this version hadn't actually made the recipes, some of which are destined to fail. The book is has also gotten a bit too French for my taste. I've got Julia Child for that.I also wish they'd bind the books so they stay together. Mine are held together with duct tape."
5,The Joy of Spices,"Howe found the book an excellent resource and now use this along with my favorite site, americanspice.com to come up with new ideas for dinner parties and entertaining. I still use the original publication, but now quite as much as the new edition."
2,"Okay, But I've Used Better","I received this cookbook as a gift on my 22nd birthday--half my lifetime ago. It was okay for what it was--a place to start to learn everyday food preparation. However, as the years went by, I noticed that many of the recipes were rather bland; some of them were downright awful. I tried making brownies--they fell. I made some salad dressing--it was inedible glop. Many other dishes came away looking and/or tasting rather strange. At first I thought it was me, but many years and recipes and cookbooks later, I had to give ""Joy"" away. If you're new to cooking, this book is extremely useful. There's lots of background on cuts of meat and basic ingredients. An experienced cook might wish to purchase a less well-known and more creative volume."
3,"expanded and updated, but hold on to older editions!","I was given this new edition for a present. It's an impressive book, with a lot of updates, however, the book has deleted some important material that the new eds must consider outdated. I have always considered Joy of Cooking one of the best general cooking reference books, but I have had to retain the previous edition for some very important recipes, etc."
2,Try to find the Joy of Cooking from 20 years ago...,"I was excited to hear that The Joy of Cooking was being renewed. I was very disappointed to see the new version. I had given the old version as a gift many times; I thought it was the very best cookbook for novice to expert. (In fact, it could lead one from novice to expert!) This edition pales in comparison. I will neither buy nor recommend it. I only hope that my old Joy will last for many more years. I wish the nephew could have just reprinted the book instead of tampering with the most instructive cookbook available."
2,Don't throw out your old edition!,"I found that this cookbook holds no joy for me. Poor print for those of us who are not blessed with 20/20 eyesight. I found I had to write out the recipes by hand so I could read them as I cooked. I am disappointed that many basic cooking skills are assumed in this edition, while in previous ones, even the most novice cook could accomplish simple meals. I am glad my old edition is in good shape still. The new edition holds little to offer besides some good asian recipes. While I agree that possum, raccoon and bear are no longer part of the North American Diet, I find som e of the recipes they put in their place to be just as strange, bizarre and totally useless for the every day cook who depended on the earlier editions."
2,Underwhelming,"Too delicate, Cheap manufacturing. Broke the focus knob on the first day by trying to adjust focus!!! Vendor replaced the product but I was not happy with the products sensitivity to handling. Resolution is good. It would have been cool if the device was battery operated. Would have made a great babycam or nanny cam."
3,short teeth dog brush,"Need to return it even tho it looks like good quality as I thought it would be appropriate for my yellow lab but I know the teeth would be too hard on her as her coat is not that thick. She sheds a lot and I was hoping it would work to strip that shedding hair but am afraid to try it as I think it would hurt her. Her hair is not tangled in any way, just sheds a lot of it."
5,Great purchase!!,The dish that I ordered was purchased for a great price and was packaged very carefully. It arrived on time and was exactly as promised.
5,Wonderful,"This crib was relatively easy to put together and it looks adorable. My little girl just loves it. It is very different from anyother doll cribs we have seen. I love the unique round shape. It is rather large, however, I have a small house and I still found somewhere to put it."
4,Radiology residents needed a book like this.,"If you like the Requisites series of texts, this book is for you. Let's face it, the average radiology resident can't wade through Stoller or Berquist and expect to remember much. This book takes musculoskeletal MR and breaks it down into a Requisites-format book of manageable length. Boxes indicating ""key points"" abound, and the pictures are of high quality. The length is appropriate for an introductory MSK MR rotation.On the minus side, the book is definitely not an exhaustive reference text. The knee chapter is relatively short, especially given the huge volumes of knee MRs radiologists are seeing. Also, the authors are a bit too opinionated about which sequences to use in some chapters - a more evidence-based and less anecdotal approach to tailoring exams would have been more useful.Overall, highly recommended for radiology residents who are encountering MSK MR for the first time."
4,Very good basic MSK book.,"The section on TMJ is the best TMJ chapter I have ever read. If you know that chapter, you will be the expert in your group on TMJ readings. The remainder of the book sets a good foundation for beginning to learn MSK radiology."
1,Doesn't fit,"Didn;t fit on a 12 ' Dewalt compound unless you ground down the spacer, and used a thin curf blade. Did all that and then the laser quit working after the first day. A waste of money!"
1,"Also it *Does not fit Bosch 14"" Miter Saw","I have not had chance to tried but seems 95 percent does not apply Bosch 12"" and Bosch 14"" Miter Saw. Check the fitting before you purchase."
4,ALMOST PERFECT,I am very impressed with this Avenger Laser Guide. The line is very bright even in outdoor use where sunlight usually hampers the brightness of the laser beam. I installed it on my DeWalt DW 708 and it was a smooth install. Takes just a few minutes and you can use your existing bolt for the guide that replaces the outside washer. I gave it only 4 out of 5 stars as the laser line is just about a 1/16th to the left of the actual cut(at least it's cutting long and not short) but after a couple practice cuts you can adjust to that with no problem. I guess if you wanted to you could just make your pencil mark at a 16th less than you need to cut and it would be perfect. ...
5,Works great on my Delta 36-585,I had read the reviews on this product and thought I would take my chances on it. I am SO glad I did. It went right on my Delta 36-585 saw and the line up of the laser to the blade was right on. I did a test cut on a 2X4 and the laser was right on. As I lifted the blade there was a perfect red line inside the cut. Is it 1/32 of an inch off? My answer would be that not many of us can measure and mark that perfectly anyway. I am going to order another one of these for my other miter saw.
4,dos en uno exelente,"Cortes precisos, se realiza dos molduras complementarias con una sóla herramienta. Hay que tener presente que se tiene que desarmar y ensamblar para obtener lo deseado, toma tiempo y cuidadado al manejar la herramienta"
2,Doesn't stand the test of time,"I remember hearing songs from this musical sung by Judy Garland on the recorded soundtrack. While Ms. Hutton is funny on the screen, she in no way can compete with Judy Garland's amazing voice.Honestly, when I listen to the prejudice against women, minorities, etc. in this 1950's version, it's not a 'play for all times' that offers enduring values.""Annie Get Your Gun"" is based on the real-life story of Annie Oakley, the crack shot who was a member of Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show and perhaps the first female superstar. If you actually want to watch Ms. Oakley's life on film, try ""Buffalo Gals"" instead.Rebecca Kyle, March 2009"
1,ANNIE GET YOUR GUN WITHOUT A LEADING LADY,"Can someone seriously explain how and why Betty Hutton became a star? Her one talent seems to be her volume.She is entirely without subtlety, sincerity, honesty in her acting and is a mediocre singer. She merely shouts.The production numbers are well done and Howard Keel does well, especially since he is playing opposite a fire engine siren."
1,annie get your gun-not,"Actually, though I own a copy I have not seen it because it refuses to play in my DVD player. I had tried to return it to the store, but they would not take it or exchange it. I do not think that Lucci is on this version and I am wondering if there was an earlier DVD release. Perhaps some day I will get to view the film."
2,"Whoa, talk about politically incorrect!","I watched this DVD with my daughters (8 and 10), and I felt like I needed to keep pausing and explaining that back in the ""old days"" people didn't realize how insulting it was to Indians to portray them like savages, and that it was OK for a girl to dumb herself down and cover up her talents so that she could get a guy to like her! I was apalled at a lot of the story line -- I didn't remember the show being like that!Of course, the music is wonderful (with the exception of ""I'm and Indian Too""), and the color and costumes are brilliant. That is where my 2 stars come from. I don't know if the show would have been better or worse with Judy Garland, as other reviewers have discussed. I just have to say that I won't watch my DVD again. I don't care how ""classic"" it is -- much of the movie was offensive."
4,A classic about the legend of Annie Oakley,"Betty Hutton is very good, but her voice isn't as good as the music sometimes deserves? In this movie we see the commercialization of Cowboys and Indians at the very beginning.What makes the American west so important is that it had apart in defining the ethos of the culture that was emergingin America that was distinct from the European version.That a woman sharp shooter was the focus of so much attention shows that American let women be individualsand were happy with the results."
5,I Thought I would Never see it,Wow! My Old frineds and my father have told me about this film. But It has never been availble even on tv. I thought Its one of those films that would never be seen again. I Can't wait to see this film and i'm sure I'll have a big party to have the first showing. If what i am told is true. Its one of the Greatest shows ever seen. And with the Dvd pully packed I'll pinch myself in a min to wake up and see it was only a dream. All we need now is Grease on DVD.
1,Annie Get Your Gun Region 2 movie,"I was not able to view the video because it is a region 2 movie. What's that, you say? Very good question. Dont' buy it if you want to view it in the United States. It does not play here without special equipment that most of us don't have. It took 3 1/2 weeks to come, then it wouldn't work. Probably the movie is great but I will never know from that seller. I am having trouble getting a refund also. Everything that I have purchased through Amazon has been wonderful with the exception of this one thing. Don't buy from Rarewaves unless you live in Europe."
5,Great Musical,Betty Hutton does a great job as Annie. Good songs. Fun story. Really enjoyed it. Glad I own a copy so I can see it over and over again.
4,NOT JUST A CHICK FLICK!!,A wonderful movie enjoyed by our whole family!!If you like cowboys& indians& musical comedy you will love this movie!!
1,Annie Get your Gun,"I have been writing emails and they are ignored by Amazon.comThis product is completely worthless, it will not play on either my DVD player or on my computer's DVD player It is not coded to play in the USA where I live. Why are you selling and shipping products to the USA that cannot be played here?I very much want this movie but cannot afford to pay any more than I already have.I have purchased many products from Amazon.com but this will be my very last if I don't recieve a copy that is coded to play in the country where I live.Thank you;Sincerely David FarberCarpentersville, IL USA"
5,I adore Betty Hutton!,"They say that ""Falling in Love"" with ""Annie Get your Gun"" is wonderful, so they say....I was raised on MGM musicals and this one was always my favorite. Imagine how disappointed I was to discover that it was never realeased on video and that I would never be able to have it in my extensive library. I hounded video houses for years in search of it and suddenly HERE IT IS, NOW PLAYING in my home and was it ever worth waiting for! The ""costumes, the scenery, the make-up, the props"" and the incredible music all add to specialness of this film. My son asked me why I loved this particular musical so much and my answer was simply, Betty Hutton. That magical, farcical face of hers in "" I'm An Indian, too""; I remember loving that scene so much as a child and now as an grown-up. I just wish I could write and tell her that what apparently was an unpleasant experience for her, made a tremedous impact on my love of the arts. There is No Annie like Betty's Annie!!"
4,Gorgeous Betty Hutton!,"Betty Hutton is the queen of this musical!She explodes through the screen with amazing energy, sweetness and talent!She is beautiful, funny, has a wonderful singing voice and dancing abilities .She must be one of the most underestimated actresses and entertainers ever!watch this musical and love her!"
4,Annie Get Your Gun,"I've been waiting over 30 years to see the movie version of ""Annie Get Your Gun"" once again. As I remembered, the songs, the music and the humor, were great. The chauvinism, which I'd forgotten, was disappointing. The 50s was a different era - immature in many respects, yet nostalgic in others. I understand the movie was intended primarily as a musical and comedy, not real life drama. I'd love to see an updated remake of the movie, stressing sensitivity, intelligence and equality for all (women, all races, and the Native Americans). In the movie Betty Hutton states, ""He's the best; I'm second."" How much better if she'd said, ""I'm not the best; he's not the best. We both are!"""
1,Annie Get your Gun,"I thought I was ordering DVD and it came VHS...returned it, and I was credited. Thank you."
5,Annie Get your gun,I ordered this DVD as a Mothers Day present for my Mom. She got it in excellent condition and was thrilled. Excellent service. Thank you.
4,Annie Get Your Gun,"It may be old, but it sure is good. Great music from Irving Berlin. It's very politically incorrect by today's standards, but enjoy it for what it is. Betty Hutton is great."
1,Worst musical EVER,"Until I saw this musical, I thought I loved anything Howard Keel has done, but even his immense talent could not hold up this humongous flop. I enjoy some crude and rude humor, but even I was offended and literally cringed when I watched the scene/musical number where Annie gets inducted into the (sioux)""sye-oxx"" tribe. Maybe this movie should be a lesson for political correctness--native americans must have been outraged by this movie...as I am now--and I'm not native american! You would be better off to buy 7 Brides for & Brothers and Calamity Jane."
2,Extras are a Big Disappointment,"I purchased this dvd specifically for the well advertised inclusion of the Frank Morgan scenes that were filmed but never used due to Frank's untimely death. What a disappointment! There is a large production number, that seems to go on forever, about Buffalo Bill is Coming, and then at the end, Frank rides up on a horse - he has about 30 seconds of screen time. I just don't think this should have been advertised as such because, having seen some of the Garland outtakes on other occasions, I expected at least a scene with Frank that included some dialogue."
1,Not what it is supposed to be..,"I purchased this item, it was supposed to be a DVD. It is a VHS and as I do not even own a VCR, I can't watch it. I have emailed the company 3 times asking how to return it or exchange it and NEVER have gotten a response back. I will NEVER order from Amazon again.. Shame on me...."
4,Annie Get Your Gun,Betty Hutton replaced the ailing Judy Garland and did a splendid job in depicting the life of sharp shooter Annie Oakley in this rollicking musical comedy. The musical is further enhanced by the music of Irving Berlin.
3,quite disappointed,"I did not like it, fell short of instructions, the kiteschool DVD [..] OR [..] is much better. It's a French made DVD but available in English in the US, they go slower, deeper and further in the instructions."
4,Well thought out and helpful,As a BEGINNER kite boarder I found this DVD very helpful. It walks through each step of the process and has a nice use of split screens to show up both what the kite is doing and what the person is doing. I would recommend this to my friends.
5,Excellent quality DVD,This DVD is the best I have seen in clearly showing you how to Kite board. It is worth every penny.
1,I never received the item!,"I paid $20 dollars for an item I never received. I tried to bring this up to the seller but I have yet to hear a response. I suppose this would be grounds for a bad review, right?"
3,Great Animation - Bad DVD,"Invader Zim is great! Agree with the other reviews.My prob is consistently the DVD itself does not work. I have several DVD players. The DVD on most of my players skips, freezes, and generally does not work. I can get the DVD to work in only one player. This happened with the other Zim DVD I bought. This does not happen with any other DVDs. All I can say is, what's up with that?"
1,"Not season three, Operation Doom","This isnt really season three this is ""Operation Doom"" Its a collection of ""favorite"" episodes from season 1 and 2."
3,game 7 saved this dvd,"the finals this year were awesome and i was excited about the dvd but when i actually got it and watched it, i was a bit disappointed. the biggest reason this dvd wasn't a waste of my money is because the dvd has the entire 7th game of the stanley cup finals on it and game 7 was just amazing. this dvd isn't really worth the full price."
3,Robbed!,The Flames should have won it in Game 6 - Gelinas' goal was clearly in...brutally disappointing end to a great playoff run. The DVD should have focused on the deserving Stanley Cup champions - that would be worth a lot more.
2,Cute but Cheap,"I bought this item for my 5 year old daughter. When I first took it out of the box, there were brown stains on the fabric, and even on the white metal parts from the packaging. It looked used. While it is very easy to assemble, it is also very flimsy. The metal support beams on the carrier do not stay in place. Also, the ""adjustable"" seat on the stroller is no more than a piece of plastic w/ shallow grooves in it....It seems probable that after just minimal use the grooves will become stripped, leaving the seat to just flop back and forth. Also, it is difficult to open and collapse the stroller, and a child would need a parent's help in doing so. In summary, though this item is cute, it is cheaply made, and not worth the money."
3,"Adorable, but not the best quality","We bought this pram for my 2 1/2 old daughter for Christmas. I've been looking at doll prams for a while and liked that this one has the option of a removable bassinet and that it could be used as a stroller as well. Although my daughter loves it and has enjoyed playing with it, I can see that it is not going to last loo long. The metal bars of the frame are thin and flimsy and the plastic grips that are supposed to keep the bassinet in place slip constantly making the bassinet slide from side to side and, at times, completely fall off. I would suggest spending the extra money for a more sturdy model/manufacture. It will last longer."
5,My grandaughter loved this stroller!,This stroller is adorable and seems to be well constructed and it absolutely made my four year old (grandaughter ) very happy!And her daddy had it put together in no time....
2,would not have purchased if I knew how cheaply made!,"I would not have purchased if I knew how cheaply made!The only part really usable is the top baby basket,the bottom stroller is made cheap and broke easily. I don't recommend buying this item."
5,Kiss your NANDA stress away!,"I've got to say I love the way this book was organized. It goes from clinical areas (MEDSURG, OB, PEDs,etc.) to body systems (GI, neuro,etc.) to disease/condtions to NANDAs r/t to the cause (also pertinent interventions/rationales/lab values). Highly recommended to those who do not want to pull all nighters to finish their care plans or carry numerous expensive books with information you may never use. Instead zip through them like pros and only have one great book at hand!"
5,A++++++++,"I love it, it's awesome, i am very pleased, what can I say, get this cause it is totally great"
4,a much better game than SS1,"THIS GAME IS DA BOMB!!!!IT HAS A KILLER SOUNDTRACK AND IT'S MUCH BETTER THAN STREETSK8ER 1.AND IT HAS A SKATEPARK EDITOR WHICH IS ALSO VERY COOL.AND THE LEVELS R MUCH MUCH MORE BIGER AND WIDER.THE LOW THING ABOUT IT IS THAT ITS JUST TOO EASY!!!!,I MEAN,I BEAT THE GAME IN 1 DAY!!AND COMBOS ARE JUST TOO HARD TO LAND.BUT EVERYTHING ELSE IS NICE.IF U ARE GOING TO GET 2 GAMES.GET STREETSK8ER2,AND THPS2,DON'T BUY THPS,IT IS OLD AND DOESN'T HAVE AS MUCH MOVES.THATS ALL FOR ME,PEACE OUT."
4,Complementary readings to Modelski's interesting book,"The synopsis of the book provided by the ""Product Description"" is fairly accurate. Therefore, I will only suggest reading the following books in addition to Modelski's: a) Cities in general: John Reader's ""Cities""; b) Venice, a city very relevant in History: John Julius Norwich's ""A History of Venice""; and William H. McNeill's ""Venice: The hinge of Europe, 1081-1797""; c) Modern city - the case of New Haven (ab uno disce omnes = from one example judge of the rest): Douglas W. Rae' s ""City: Urbanism and Its End""."
3,NOT for KINDLE,"I came to Amazon to see about purchasing this book for my boys who are learning to read. The book itself is highly recommended and I'm sure it's wonderful.However, I do not recommend purchasing this book in Kindle format. All the pictures are missing and it's not worth the $[...] they are charging for it. In fact, the book itself states ""These eBooks are for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online at [...]Amazon should seriously consider making this series free to their Kindle owners. As it is, simply search for the free ebook online and you'll get a better copy."
1,"Why, Gutenberg? Why??","Why would you charge for this book without letting people know that you've omitted all the illustrations? The quality is good, formatting excellent as usual, but I am so irritated that you didn't include the entire book!!!"
3,No pictures,"This book has no pictures, so it makes the text very boring and dry. I would love to see the accual book and not the kindal addition. There is also no ""teachers edition"" I know it was written before all that, but having no instruction is hard when you are not trained in phonics."
3,Meini Wood Claves,"This product is O.K. for making a wooden rasp, low volume sound for percussion background. Anything other than soft drums and acoustic guitars may drown out the sound. I, personally, am not a percussion student, so check other reviewers' notations if they exist. These may be fine for middle school orchestral use."
1,not a real instrument,"I honesty thought these would be an actual set of claves, but they turned out to be nothing buy a simple pair of sticks. don't get them not even for your kids. these claves ARE A JOKE."
1,Revisionist claptrap,"And an apology for the single most corrupt period of our entire history. The Constitution was emasculated between 1861 and 1877 and remains a shadow of itself even today. Lincoln's assasination was the beginning of the end for the South? Any ""scholar"" still enraptured by that myth has been skipping their medication. Lincoln was the despot who let the genie out of the bottle in the first place. There was not a single one of of the 10 Amendments that he did not break. This is just more cultural marxist, revisionist spin. Enough, please."
5,American Experience--Reconstruction: The Second Civil War,"This program is outstanding. Telling the story of Reconstruction through several case studies, the viewer see this agonizing chapter in American history through a clear window. The scholars offering commentary are the best in the field. I highly recommend this program."
3,It's ok,"The video is somewhat informative, but it didn't cover the issues of reconstruction that I was expecting. It did cover some of the political issues, but it was more about the African American issues. I was hoping for some of the long term repercussions in the south as a result of this horrible era."
5,You Will Never Find a More Addictive Game!,"What can I say about tony hawks pro skater except BUY IT! there is a plethora of skaters available all with 3 great specials including tony hawks 900. The courses and backround are great and make for high replayability. Although I have mastered the game by getting all the skate tapes I still enjoy the two player mode tremendously. different stages provide new challenges like roswell new mexico, a shopping mall and many more great courses you have to unlock. This game scores A+ with me it will with you too!"
2,Dont Buy this,"i traded a kid at camp for this game and i can tell you, it stinks. it has an extreme lack of features like any kind of saving. (it doesnt even use passwords) this game lasted me only 10 minutes to get bored of. if you want a quality, addicting game check out Mario Golf, Mickey Racing, or Zelda DX"
2,definately not a gameboy game,the tracks are way to easy ive won ternaments with all the skaters already and did the 900 w/ tony more times then i can count theres only 3 vert tracks and no compition. oh did i mention i got this game only 2 days ago. definatly a better big screen game
2,This game really bad!,"I bought this game for my game boy at [a local store] for [money]. This game is not even worth [money]. I brought the game home and I put it in my game boy. I played it for 5 minutes and I lost intrest in it. The graphics stunk. Every Time time you do a trick like an Indy, they stop the game and say congratulations! You did an Indy. You only get 3 points and they stop the game for a couple of seconds and then you get to go back to the game. Their are only a couple of tricks you can do and it always says you did an indy. I also beat this game in 5 minutes. It is not worth it. Save your money and buy a better game!"
3,I think this game is not as good as the nintendo 64 one.,I think this game is not that good you can not do any tricks on this once and you can not do rotations with the few tricks you can do and you can not tell when you are grinding. If you want a Tony Hawk game get the one on Nintendo 64.
2,skateboarding not meant for gameboy,"Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this game. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater is great on the ""big screen"" (N64 or Sony) but amounts to little more than a joke on the Gameboy.There are very few tricks in this version, and most of the ones featured don't look good anyway. The street mode is unrealistic; all you do is ollie onto 3 or 4 different obstacles and grind them. Wow. The control isn't on point, either.The half pipe mode is decent, but once again, not many tricks to do. Activision should have spent more time on this one. Too bad."
1,Tonys Waiting For #2,"Tony Hawks Pro Skater is a cheap buy.You love it for 2 days then you get bored.Thr aren't enough things to do, you can't do ""literly"" any tricks.If you wan't a good skatboard game get Tony Hawks Pro Skater 2."
1,Stupid Game,"This game stunk! First of all, it was WAY to short. Three minutes, tops. Also, too few areas."
5,Very moving and tender,"Sean Penn was excellant but so was his real life love Robin. I had never seen her, and can't wait to see her again. With him, of course. Being from L.A., I met John Travolta when we were both 21 yrs old ( or young ), he is real guy with all the """"Vinnie"" charm, I was glad to see how well he is doing, in all his flicks."
1,Penn's Acting Acmen Could Not Save This Turkey,The dialouge from this film must have been written in the 1940's. A nonsensical plot and general poorly done screenplay evident throughout this film. Sean Penn & Travolta delivers a good performance but wife Robin was horribly mis-cast. This film is just bad.
1,She's So Lovely,"I didn't like this movie. I watch it and the very next day I found myself thinking about how that movie ended and how it bothered me. I will never watch this movie again and I will let my friends and family know. For someone to actually leave their life behind, a wonderful family, and children for a crazy person who can't even stable himself out is pathetic. I just don't like the fact that she pick a messed up person to replace probably the best 4 people in her life. They should have ended it differently and maybe then I would like it, but for a moive to bother me after a night of viewing, I wished that I would have never stayed up to watch it."
4,Robin Wright rocks!,"Watch this movie if just to admmire Robin Wright's excellent performance in the first half. The second half didn't require that much acting from her. In fact, in my opinion, the whole movie falls apart after the point where Eddie is released from the institution. The first part of the movie really draws you in and it feels real. You may not admire the characters but it's an accurate depiction of how life is for some people. I consider this a very good, entertaining movie, compared to all the usual [stuff] that's out there."
5,Sean Penn's best work,"I wasn't terribly impressed with Sean Penn's work with titles like Dead Man walking, but he is excellent in this film and proves he is a serious and talented actor. If character development is important in a film, this is the right movie for you. Opening up Penn's shell is mysterious and wonderful"
1,Worst Movie Ever made,There is not much to say except watching this movie is torture and this is the worst movie ever made in my book & my husbands.
3,"All the right ingredients for a great movie, needed a writer","This movie has a good story line. Penn does a good job. Travolta is excellent. Unfortunately, John T's appearance is minimum. Fast forward to the last 1/3 of the movie and from there on its 5 stars. That is when Travolta comes on the scene. A bit of over use of the (f) word, especially around the young children. I truly think this movie could have been better scripted and it would have really grabbed me. The story was there, the actors were cast perfect, just something was missing to make this a truly good movie. I blame the script. Sound quality was average. I won't add this one to the collection."
1,Unbelievably bad,"I must admit that I am stunned by the amount of positive feedback there has been to this film. It was not in the least bit entertaining, and was quite possibly one of the 5 worst movies I have ever seen.The acting was not bad, but the script was terrible. The characters are uniformly unsympathetic, which left me totally ambivalent towards their unfalteringly stupid choices. This film follows the basic theme of ""you can take a girl out of the slum, but you cannot take the slum out of the girl."" Unlike other similarly themed films, however, this one is not funny, not romanic, not pretty, and not worth renting for a dollar.The sets are unattractive. The dialog is disjointed and boring. There is, in all seriousness, not one single good thing I can think of to say about this film.Please, if you are seriously considering purchasing this title, RENT IT FIRST. Better to waste a little money than a lot. I hope I have helped some of you avoid repeating my mistake."
4,She's So Lovely,"Dark comedy...bunch of drunks, something happens and then 10 years later...the only thing that changes is they've all dyed their hair! I found this movie, awakening, moving, sad, and even funny at times."
4,Some of The Best Tunes You'll Ever Hear,"The only electronica album that can come even close to The Prdoigy Experience is Fat of the Land by the same group. Keith Flint doesn't have his funky hair at this point but that doesn't matter too much. My favourite song off of the album is ""Wind It Up"" due in no small part to the pumping beats that have been mixed Liam Howlett. You can do a lot worse than to buy this album."
5,"best music ever made-I mean kith,maxim,liam ...just listen","i have no words to describe this great album just 11 from 10... wonderful , funky ,crazy , wild ..."
5,"You must experience, ""Experience""","Experience is a testament to Liam Howlett, the genius behind The Prodigy. What do you want to listen to? Hardcore industrial, look no further than track 1 ""Jericho"". Want to listen to a little bit lighter techno, ""Wind It Up"", or ""Fire"" provide. If you want to dance, go to the last track, and ""Death of the Prodigy Dancer"" won't let you stand still. This cd is why The Prodigy is the greatest band in the world, and why Liam Howlett deserves way more credit than what he gets for the revolution that Prodigy started. One thing I will say, is that unless you have heavy bass, or a very nice music system, some of the songs won't have the same appeal, because of the complicated beats within beats that Liam Howlett integrates with Maxim Reality's voice, you will thank yourself if you listen to this cd on a good sistem. Nevertheless I garuntee this cd will be in your steady rotation, and it won't get out of it anytime soon."
5,Atmospheric Music,"This debut from The Prodigy is really different from their later albuns. The Prodigy Experience got a really raw sound mixing eletronic beats with keyboards and other instruments. When i listen to Experience for the first time, i though it's just a bunch of noise and beats, but after three or four times, Experience became a real nice instrumental trip. There's almost none vocals, so Experience works like a real good lounge journey."
2,Fat of the Land is better...,"I _did_ fall prey to the positive comments written about this cd, bought it, and dislike it with a passion. so far, Fat of the Land is the best I've heard from the Prodigy, but will be checking out Jilted Generation"
3,On a more somber/sober note.,"The casual listener will not be wowed quite as much as these other tripped-out party-goers. Yes, the tracks are catchy and energetic, but also quite simplistic (even for Prodigy). For more varied works try the later releases... Jilted for the enlightened, Fat for the commercially-minded."
5,This Album is bad ...!!,"I never write reviews, but I just had to give these guys credit. This is the kind of music you'll be listening to on the freeway when you glance down at the speedometer and find that you're going 30mph over the speed limit. I listen to this every day on the way to work, it's better than Star Buck's. Yes they do sound kind of like Slipknot, but that's okay I happen to like Slipknot. My favorite track is ""rot"", I have never heard anything like it before, you gotta hear it, it's awesome!"
4,I like such band,I really appreciate dry kill logic this band.This is awesome band.Dry kill logic's member are very modest people.modest makes people progress.so i believe dry kill logic's second album must much better than debut.all of track on this album are my favorite.Dry kill logic.no one.spineshank indeed are promising band.If you haven't this album.I suggest you guy it at once .
4,The Melodic Side of Nonsense,"When I first listened to DKL, I found out that they are not just about blistering guitars and the kind of rip your face off vocals(dont get me wrong I like the screaming). I figured out while reading the reviews online of this album, that people seemed to enjoy the songs ""nightmare"", ""assfault"" and ""rot"". So immediately I thought that those would be the only good songs. After listening to those songs, I felt like they had the writing ability to create more great songs. So, just like that I started over and listened to the whole thing all the way through. The surprising thing is that none of the tracks were at all bad. In fact they are all worth listening to. If you want a CD that has energy all the way through, rather than just one good song or single, get this CD. Im having writers block right now, so if your into metal or nu-metal, check this CD out. You wont regret listening to this band."
4,Relentless Onslaught,"Excellent CD. I've listened to Assfault 20 times since I got it yesterday. Every song kicks you in the face. The vocals are so intense I don't know how the (...) he does it!!!!! I've seen them play live a while ago and can't wait to catch them play these new songs. My last four CD purchases: DKL, Tool, Pantera and Slayer - not bad company, huh? Buy this CD and I'll refund your money personally if you're not totally blown away."
4,Catchy yet immature offering from DKL,"I had the opportunity to see these guys when they were still called Hinge. They were opening for Fear Factory, along with Switched and American Head Charge.I think they made a good name change choice, cause Hinge just doesn't have a very good ring to it.Anyway, I really enjoyed their live show. Lots of energy. But I give them 3.5 stars for this because of the level of immaturity in the songs. Compared to their 2nd and 3rd releases, this one is the rawest, most random album in their catalog.But even so, it has it's share of awesome mosh-inducing songs. If I was just getting into these guys, I would start with The Dead and Dreaming or Of Vengeance and Violence."
5,Holy Hell this CD kicks @$$,"This is the best new band that i have found. This band rules, they are a toss of slipknot and stonesour. They seriously rock and it is one of the best albums to listen to when you are extreamly pissed off to keep the rage burning inside."
1,killed logic,"Everyone else seems to think this cd is great. I sold it 2 days after buying it. Why? Well, they sound like about 800 other bands out there today and I found that their song 'assfault' sounds DISTURBINGLY SIMILAR to 'breathe' by Skinlab. Definately not on. This is just another cliche filled, generic, angsty nu metal fad, and is nowhere even remotely similar to Slipknot. It's a slow, chugging, pointless album that did nothing for me whatsoever. Except maybe the start of 'Rot'. It starts out as a good fast paced song, then what happens? It just stops. And becomes another slow boring song sounding like any korn-inspired garage band in the world. It sounds like an album full of fillers. Definately avoid this."
2,Disappointed,"I ordered these to wear at my niece's wedding. I was so happy to see the box waiting at my door. Unfortunately, when I opened the jewelry box to look at my new pearls, what I saw was not the purple strand I had ordered and expected, but a sandy/peach strand. It's a beautiful necklace, and I'll probably give them to my mother for Christmas, but I was wanting purple to go with my chosen outfit."
1,very disappointed,"1000 secrets? To be honest, I didn't find any secrets. I found about 10 generic ideas that were each repeated with slightly different words 100 times. (Here are the top 4: spend less! don't pay fees! buy things cheap! interest adds up!) Maybe that's effective with some 17 year olds but it made me feel like I wasted my money on this book."
5,Old style fiddle at it's best,"I own 100 bluegrass album and this one is one of the best. I have to warn you though, it is really a bunch of OLD STYLE fiddlin'. Every fiddler should get this to see how they used to fiddle. The sound quality isn't the greatest. If you want good sound quality bluegrass instrumental stuff, my favorite is Tony Rice Bluegrass Guitar Album or the Bryan Sutton albums."
2,Not that good,The gold ring around the face has to be removed to start the battery and then it won't stay back on.
1,bad bad phone,This phone should never have left the drawing board. I am in the process of returning same.
5,Mulling Spices,Great product for apple cider. The aroma is divine. Mulling Spices should belong in all well stocked kitchens and pantries.
2,It didn't stop,"I didn't find the book very helpful. It used a lot of words to discover why the dog barks, but not much information on how to stop it...except to say...it's very difficult."
2,Just kill the neighbor,I gave 2 stars probably because pictures were quite entertaining. The rest is absolutely useless. To stop the bark you have to eliminate the cause. Oh really? How clever! Just kill the neighbor.
2,Disappointing.,"I usually love everything that comes out by Michael Card, but the songs in this cd were Michael Cards songs sung in Talbot's style, which I don't like."
5,Two of MY Favorites,"I can't imagine my spiritual life devoid of the music of John Michael Talbot. I still have an original vinyl copy of ""The Painter"" by John Michael and Terry Talbot. ""Brother to Brother"" combines the talents of two of Christian music's best puryeyors. They get to sing on one another's compositions and give great interpretations of the other's work. A very pleasant listen that I personally recommend to all who appreciate either musician's seperate recordings."
5,"A Classic From 2 Brothers From Different Mothers, But The Same Heavenly Father!",I loved every song on this Album! I wish they would get together and record again.Two very talented artist using their talent to lead us in worship no matter where we are.
5,"Pleasing to the ears, soothing to the heart","I'm not all that familiar with the music of John Michael Talbot, but if you like the music of Michael Card even a little bit, then you must have this CD. In it, the two men sing each other's songs, at times singing together. I was especially pleased with the opening song, ""One Faith,"" apparently one of JMT's songs. My personal favorite Michael Card song is ""Love Crucified Arose,"" and I really wish it had been included on here. Also, JMT has such a fine, poetic voice that I think he would have complimented that song very nicely. Fortunately, my other favorite Michael Card song, ""Come to the Table,"" is included on this CD, and they both sing it. It sounds wonderful.Overall, this is a great CD to listen to for pleasure, or worship, or to simply reflect on the Word of God. I highly recommend it."
5,Very relaxing reflective music.,"I enjoyed Michael's style of vocal and musical talent that is very evident and allows deeper understanding of his message. He is very skilled at ""Christian"" music."
4,Nice classics.,"The book is very good, especially because it has chinese characters, literary translation and commentary for all the classics it presents.It has however one issue:On page 237 of 2nd. edition 1st. print, Author writes: ""Xing Yi Quan is sometimes called Xin Yi Quan because the heart plays such an important role.""This is wrong. Xin Yi Quan is the older name from when the style had only 10 animals and was called Liu He Xin Yi Quan. Xing Yi Quan inherited the classics from that style, which is why it is spelled that way. He should read up on that and correct it for next print.I suggest he write a book with the classics of Xin Yi Quan, it has actually become a very popular style in Shanghai, China."
3,Xinyi review,"This book is not bad for learning learning xingyiquan. However a lot of things are missing. eg ba zi gong-zhan,jie,guo,qua,tiao,ding,yun,linFor Two person training other then (An shen pao) there are also two person training that are not in the book such as Wu hua pao."
1,do not buy this book,"i wanted to learn how to use xingyi in fighting and how a xingyi practitionar would spar and fight using xingyi..nope, no theory,tactics or stratigy here.get andrea folks transilation of li tainji's skill of xingyi quan for the most avilable complete giude."
5,two sides...,"Since there's two sides to every story, don't instantly believe everything you read or hear. Those who do want to support Frank directly can buy his own, inferior version of this. The Expansion issue of this excellent record IS the best one, musically and sonically. And whatever the real story may be, please be glad that these recordings, Franks very best he ever made, have been rescued from the Mojazz/Motown vaults. Without the efforts of Expansion they might have been unreleased forever...This is classic soul music, beautifully sung and near perfectly produced and arranged by the great Steve 'The Scotsman' Harvey. He's actually also the guy that partly paid for making the record..."
3,Ok I guess,"This book is okay, its a bit repetitive though. All of the individual diagrams are not necessary since they are so incredibly repetitive (I don't need to see twelve different positions to start a major scale) and THE ROOT NOTES AREN'T EVEN made to stand out. This book is huge, but could have been much smaller and accomplished the same thing. They have some rare scales though... which I never use."
1,Perhaps can be used like the old Sears catalog!,"When a student brings one of these books to a lesson it is almost a guarantee that they know nothing about the fingerboard.This series has captivated a certain segment of the guitar owning population. I have found any amazingly small amount of actual useful musical information in them.If the student doesn't have a basic music theory book that would be a start..the Walter Piston Harmony book maybe. For more specific guitar information Guitar Lore, pub, Theo Presser, by master teacher (taught both John Coltrane and Pat Martino) Dennis Sandole. Even the Mel Bay Modern Guitar book would teach you more about actual music. Howard Roberts wrote a single page about scales in his Guitar Player magazine monthly workshop that detailed a musical approach to scales...using only 5 'shapes'!"
2,Computer-generated fluff,"All the Guitar Grimoire books in particular should be about 10-20 pages long, in which case they would be very interesting guide pamphlet (for example: for this exotic scale, this is the interval pattern, the diatonic chords, finger patterns for each mode; have fun). However, by getting a computer to generate every possible fingering pattern for every key/mode that you can easily derive yourself is a waste of paper. I guess it tries to justify its price by being 10x longer than it needs to be. Computer-generated texts might have been fun and exciting in the 90s, but people have brains too."
2,For beginners only,For amateurs only. I was disappointed with this book. I learned most of these scales and modes within my first 3 years of playing guitar. He begins most of his scales with F instead of the chromatic center......?The only guitarists I could recommended this book to would be modern rock and pop guitarists that are in bands playing simple grunge rock which is somewhat limited in it`s approach to interesting modes. Advanced guitarists need not apply.
3,Bad Quality,Good book. Has about every scale and mode of the scale that every guitarist could want and more then most will ever use. However the book qualitys kind of [bad]. After a few weeks the first 20 pages of the book came out. Aside from that its a good scale book.
5,fierce,an amazing book about the best bike ever made. The author is very intelligent and has an excellent grasp of her subject. The only real bummer is the design. Perhaps the publisher could have had a best-seller if they had spent a nickel on the design. Otherwise a very resourseful and brilliant work.
2,Far more forms than substance,"Half of the book is readily-available boilerplate forms. One third of the remainder is verbatim Texas Probate Code. Of that which remains, only about one quarter applies to any given situation.Bottom line: Don't plan to spend more than 15 minutes reading this book. Helpful advice, such as how best to conduct the inventory and value property, are nowhere to be found.It's better than nothing if you want a high-level overview of the process, and sufficient if all you need to do is file the forms. Otherwise, look for something with more useful substance."
3,Book needs updates,The Texas legislature changed several provisions of the Texas Probate Code in 2005.This book needs some updates but is still helpful in general.
4,It has John Cleese... of course it's funny!,"Ok, I love John Cleese. This movie is a great sleeper starring the master. There is less physical comedy and more subtle comedy in this film, and I like that. It will never be listed among his master works I'm sure, but a great and cute little film. If you like Cleese, this belongs in your collection."
4,Classic Cleese,"John Cleese at his frenetic long-legged gawky best, complete with a wife who doesn't understand him. He plays a school headmaster obsessed with time, who ends up being late for an important event. Along the way he ends up embarassingly entangled with one of his teenage girl students, and the whole thing proceeds in a glorious series of events from bad to worse. Great fun if you're a Cleese fan, and probably impenetrably strange if you're not!"
4,Essential for Cleese fans,Very funny movie. John Cleese plays his bumbling character perfectly. The disc also includes an informative interview with Mr Cleese. Highly Recommended!
3,Poor copy,"I love this movie and was so excited to find it on DVD. However, when it arrived, I was highly disappointed to find that the video quality was extremely poor and was most likely copied from a VHS tape. One expects a DVD to have been made from a clean original film scan, not cheaply copied from a low res videotape. Where is the quality control?"
3,Historically inaccurate,"While the book "":So This is Klickitat"" is about a tiny town in Southcentral Washington State, and not many towns can boast having a history written about them - ""So This is Klickitat"" IS historically inaccurate! I give Selma M. Neils credit for attempting to write a book on Klickitat's history. But, it would have been nice if she got her historical facts right. the photos of old Klickitat however more than make up for the book's historical mistakes!!! I highly recommend it as a view to small town life!!!!!"
1,Weak!,"This doesn't approach their work from the 60's; it has none of the intensity, rawness, and inspiration. Hard to beleive that this is the same band (well, sort of) that produced a cover of Ray Davies' ""I'm Not Like Everybody Else"" that far outshone the original. If I somehow found myself needing to explain rock and roll to someone, that might well be the first song I would choose to play for him. And though I think it is their best song, it is representative of their sound at the time.If they re-release a compilaton of their original material (And I do mean, theirs. Their original albums included significant numbers of instrumental pieces recorded not by the Chocolate Watchband, but by studio musicians.), I will gladly buy it. But this is not worth purchasing..."
5,Best general airship book I have seen.,"This book the best I have seen for the history of the airship. It covers the same ground as most airship histories, but covers it in more detail leading to a very different interpretaton of the events. Just one example: The Mongofiler brothers had no idea that their balloon ran on hot air. They thought that their smoky fire produced another kind of light gas, similar to hydrogen. Another great feature of this book are the number of direct quotes from original sources. You really appreciate history when you hear from those who lived it. The book is well illustrated, with drawings where no photos exist, and with tons of photographs. Many airships that are illustrated with drawings in other books are shown as photographs in this one, making the ships all the more real to the modern reader. There is a lot of information on modern airship developments, too. All and all, an amazing book. It manages both wide and deep coverage of the subject."
4,"Much like The Labirynth or Nightmare Asylum, but better.","By reading the cover of this book, I got the impression that it would be much the same as Nightmare Asylum or The Labyrinth. A paranoid guy in command of a remote space staion is breeding Aliens for some reason. But when I read the book, I noticed many differences, or improvements, on these novels. For instance, the action sequences are much more exciting and a real enjoyment, and there is a real feeling of fear from beginning to end. Unfortunately, there isn't quite enough character developement save for the main heroine. Overall, a very good book."
3,Above average spin-off,"This book provides the requistite gore, violence, profanity and usual carnage, but also delivers sex!But that's about all that separates this story from many others like it. The characters are less characiture-like and more human, but still have little distinguishing traits, including the heroine. There is little here to strangle your kitty over. The violence isn't done in any way that makes it particularly memorable or wrenching. There little appeal to imagery or nuance. Nothin vivid or intriguing in the character department like in ALIEN HARVEST. Recommended for Aliens fans, but nothing to pull in the skeptics"
3,Rogue: An action packed Shoot 'em up Alien tale,"This novel is really just a shoot 'em up cowboy tale, with the Indians being aliens. Very high tech with okay character development. There is a not so good love story subplot, but it does prove to be a good story with some stolen ideas from the alien movies. The story is about this planet were this Proffesor is supposed to find good use of the aliens on the planet. The Proffesor is crazy and insteads starts sending people to their death and creates a creature named Rogue. The Rogue is supposed to fight the alien queen and win the war for the humans, but something unexpected happens. I won't tell what, but altogether it is an okay book that is good to read if you like the alien series. Three and a half stars."
5,I was very satisfied with the product.,"I was hoping to receive it sooner, however, when it arrived, I was very satisfied with the product."
2,Typos to the max,"I bought the kindle edition of this book. The content of the book is ok-- the doctor isn't finished with his own therapy since he has so many boundary issues. However, my complaint with this Kindle edition is that it is rife with typos that are extremely distracting. These e-books should be proofread more carefully before they are available for sale."
3,"Not bad, but not delicious","I read this book and am half-way through another by this author, ""Psychopath"". While he's not a terrible writer, he's far from the best - even in this specific genre.I just have one question: Why does everyone in his books do so much WINKING? Characters are constantly winking at other characters. Who DOES that these days? I don't think I've seen anyone wink for decades. This must be a personal quirk of the author and I found the repetitiousness of it quite tedious. Mr. Ablow, please stop with the winking! kthxbai"
3,Good But Not As Good As The Others,"I enjoyed this book, but it isn't as good as his first two books. This one I felt moved a little slower and was just harder to get into. I didn't find the female lead character to be what the author wants you to think she is. Mr. Ablow describes her as siren that no man can resist. However, I don't get why she would give Frank Clevenger a second glance other than what she can get from him professionally in the mystery of who killed her daughter. However I did get interested in Billy Bishop, the young sociopath son in the book. I hope we see him in future books. He was a fascinating and unpredictable character. Overall, I felt this book moved quickly but it was easy to see where it was going. I enjoyed the look into ethical dilemnas of relationships with your clients and into a sociopathical mind, but it wasn't enough to pull this book out. It was just ok. I would recommend this book to other that are reading the series to understand future books."
2,Tries too hard,This book could have been shortened by at least 40 pages. It tries too hard to throw out red herrings and pushes suspects too vividly until the reader KNOWS they won't end up being the killer.The main characters are ordinary except for the doctor who doesn't act accordingly and is entirely unprofessional to the point of being overdrawn.You don't end up caring about any of the characters and when the book ends you are ready to go take your laundry out of the dryer.
3,"Did Keith Ablow, M.D. Really write this book?","The concept of this book is compelling, but the identityof the killer is much too easy to deduct. The motivationsare at times unbelieveable and key points are hurried overto make a point. Is it really possible for these womento fall in love so easily and completely? Also, thereare some medical howlers that a first year nursing studentwouldn't make; on the other hand, some paragraphs on cranialanatomy was either written by a physician or copied froman anatomy book. Medications used are irrational: nophysician would give Motrin to a victim of a stab woundeven if the patient were an ex-addict. I could go on andon, but the whole thing smacks of a hack job with a fewquick additions by the purported author."
2,"Decent story, but the main character ruins it","Frank is a creepy, creepy guy. And I got the feeling that he reflects the author's perspective. I'm no shrink, but there's something seriously wrong with ALL the women in this book, but what's stranger is the way their inexcusable behavior is excused by both the author and Frank. I actually found the cuckolded husband (who was supposed to be the ""bad guy"") to be the most normal character. The part about Frank supposedly being a alcoholic, but apparently having no trouble drinking in moderation was odd too. The hostility towards financially successful men was distracting as well. I would imagine that Keith Ablow makes plenty of money off his novels. He should get over it already."
4,Great cant put down,"An amazing book I could barely put down, I was lucky to be able to pry it from my hands for when the bell wrung in-between my classes. One of the only draw backs is that Mr. Ablow focuses a little too much on the anatomy of the females in the book and not enough on the murders. Other then this the book was pretty [dang] good."
3,"""Saintly love. Kiss my foot. Kiss the rubber ends of canes"" Huh?","Poetic prose like that is no surprise from Gass. But somehow every page comes with surprises, sudden shifts, silly stuff and occasionally, sometwisting tickles or cutitudenous insight (well, more like a peek now and then when you don't expect it.""(Go to a movie.) Forward and back, in and out, up and down,"" we skip ab O uT. And like that, there: in fancy frenetics.At worst, silly.At best, an amusing divertissement,but only for hard-core Gass fans."
4,Works Great...,"I don't have much to say about this review because the cable definitely does its job and it does it well. The price is really low considering that it's a 25 FT cable and you aren't going to find a better competitor for this price. If you want something ""better"" you can always go for a more expensive brand of these cables, but for me this one works great. It does the same as a ""brand"" cable and gives great sound when connected to my speakers and there was no loss of quality audio. I rate this product 4 stars out of 5 stars!I hope this review helped you out!"
4,length!!,If you're hooking your lap top to your tv you want a longer one so you can sit where you want and still control the laptop
5,Some officials don't want you to read this book...,"...because it exposes their myths, humanizes a pressing political issue, and reveals hidden casualties of prohibition. And it accomplishes this through a creative narrative that appeals to politicians, churchgoers, law enforcement officials, and ditch-diggers alike.This book has more potential for changing public policy than a thousand pot rallies. That's exactly why some government officials hope Prescription Pot will ""go gentle into that good night"".So take my advice. Be a good citizen. Become informed in your mind and heart. Just say NO to ignorance. And read this book!"
5,Every American Patient and Doctor Should Read This Book,"I had no interest in medical marijuana when I first picked up Prescription Pot, but I soon discovered this book is not some hippie diatribe. It is one of the most heartfelt, amusing and intriguing biographies I've ever read, with the ability to teach people the value of civil political discourse. This is an underdog's tale that every person dealing with pain, disability and death should experience. And the groundbreaking clinical study contained in the appendix is convincing evidence of official wrongdoing."
3,Black and white movie about a red planet man,"See, Ed Crane is from Mars. And he fell in love with his human wife but Martians don't know how to express love. Get it? I'm not kidding. That's why he acts the way he does. The Coen brothers rewrote Albert Camus' The Stranger, turned it into a noir film, and added the alien visitation thing."
2,bloodless and boring,"Well-acted, with sumptuous black & white cinematography by Roger Deakins, and still the most bloodless and boring noir in film history. Which begs the question: Why hire Billy Bob Thornton, an actor with personality to burn, to play a character with no personality at all?..."
2,Man Who Wasn't There never gets there,"The Coen brothers have made some of my favorite movies, but this one never goes anywhere. It comes off as a movie that the Coen brothers are trying to slide by you, after all Billy Bob is the star, and isn't Billy Bob just the actor's actor? And it's black and white - so it must be arty.This movie is heavy and dark, and my feeling and experience is that the Coen brothers don't do just plain dark very well. While usually their darker comedies are richly absurd, this one is just, well, absurd. And tedious."
2,if you can't sleep...,"OK, film buffs, I guess I'm not sophisticated enough to appreciate art. i.e. very slooooow moving movies w/ simplest plot,nothing going on, but with, (oh-yeah), a lot of facial expressions - I recommend this movie if you have insomnia. Give me a old Hitchcock movie any day over this one."
5,You are an enthusiast,"Yes he is. But who knows? Who would imagine a quiet barber with a boring job has a sincere attempt to reach for something finer, more meaningful in life? There are many Ed around us, there are many Ed among us."
4,A Dark Tale,I would have to rate the Coen bro's as high as anybody in hollywood for shear artistic brilliance. I would follow them down any dark alley if they were showing a movie in that alley. The fact that this movie was a disappointment should really come as no surprise to anybody. Nobody has a perfect record of great films and it was only a matter of time before the Coen's stumbled a bit. I've never been impressed by Thornton but I can see why he was cast as the dark protagonist in the story. Unfortunately he just dosn't seem an interesting character and the lack of any interesting characters in the film is where the Coen's drop the ball. This was the big surprise to me after all the great characters in all the other Coen pictures from the witty gangsters in Millers crossing to the archetypal characters in Art Thou. I will say my faith in the Coen's is by no means diminished but I don't think this is one I will revisit.
2,The Coens missed the mark on this one.,"This is one of their dark, noirish efforts, and as much as I love the Coens, this movie made me want to take a nap. If you're a fan of ""Big Lebowski"", ""Raising Arizona"", ""Fargo"" and ""O Brother"", skip this one.Contrary to the film's title, Billy Bob Thornton IS there, and sure makes you wish he wasn't."
2,What were the Coen Brother's Thinking???,"What on earth were they thinking...with such films as ""Raising Arizona,"" ""Fargo,"" and ""O Brother Where art Thou?"" under their belts you'd expect more from the Brother Coen!And Billy Bob, oh Billy Bob, what were you thinking? ""Sling Blade,"" ""Monsters Ball"" - come on!!!What a dreary, unfunny (granted the Coens are not your typical funny - but come on with lines like ""Oph. My Hair"" and ""Is that your friend in the woodchipper."" they could have done better), boring, put you to sleep film! YUCK!But...they are after all the Coen Brothers and they will bounce back and I am a die hard fan! They'll do better next time...just not this one!"
3,Not Billy Bob's finest hour,"The Coen brothers have made some great movies. This one is worth watching, it just isn't close to ""Fargo"", or ""Oh Brother.."""
2,"Kinda Bored, man.","I think Billy Bob Thornton should get himself out of this kind cliche so-called Noir movie ASAP. Because this kind movie would gradually ruin his acting career. All these kind movies, what he could only do in them are: wrinkled his eyebrows, chain smoking, deadbeat trance, empty eyesight, sitting or walking around like having taken too many sleeping pills. This is a very pretentious movie that trying very hard to be looked cool but only fell short to be bored and washup. High praises are totally not necessary unless you want to prove to yourself that the money you wasted on this pathetic boring movie was wisely spent. Have mercy on us, Thornton, get some better and more active scripts before signing up."
3,Slow-moving noir film,"This is a very slow-paced, b/w, noir film by the Coen Brothers, who employ a great cast, as always, with a decent script that gets progressively bleaker as the story goes on. They make great use of light and shadow and cigarette smoke to add to the overall ""feel"" of the film.Many lingering shots could have been trimmed in order to make the pacing a bit crisper. Also, there is little to no humor or comic relief here, so you have to be in mood for a story that is relentlessly downbeat."
2,it's got one problem.....it's incredibly boring.,"this has a ""Coen Brothers"" movie written all over it. great acting, cinematography and great dialogue, but with only one problem, it is boring as hell!! At two hours long it just plods along putting the viewer to sleep. By far, it is better than most movies that Hollywood puts out, but compared to other Coen Brother masterpieces like Raizing Arizona and Miller's Crossing, this is a disappointment."
2,Billy Bob is bad,"This movie [stunk]. I didn't enjoy any of the performances and except for Billy Bob, the main character, I like all the other actors. This was not an interesting movie. It was not a funny movie. It didn't go by fast, which movies should, because they are for entertainment purposes. It's in black and white, which, although super progressive, just doesn't cut it and I understand why it was purposely done that way. At least I believe they purposely made the movie that way for a reason, but you'll have to waste an hour and fifty minutes to understand. Anyways, their is nothing good about the movie except Billy Bob Thorton may have developed emphysema."
2,The Movie That Wasn't There,"While this film is sort of interesting, and has an art house cinematic visual appeal, it lacks the usual compelling plot progression that makes most Coen brothers' films so much fun. Thronton lives up (down?) to the title of his role, and James Gandolfini, Tony Shalhoub, and Jon Polito all briefly shine in their respective parts, but the apathy of Billy Bob's character seems to infect the whole process. Can't recommend it."
2,fairy Average,"saw this movie recently&despite the Folks involved in the film it didn't really hit all the way for me.somehow this film reminded me of Steve Martin's ""Dead Men Don't Wear Plad"".the one line that stood out for me was when the Music Instructor told Billy Bob that Girl who Played Piano just didn't have feeling in Her Playing.He said it's cool to know the Notes but you gotta have feeling.and that speaks on about this film&other parts on the Entertainment Game.this Story was already figured out with the first half hour.not as deep as it should have been.interesting to a certain point though."
5,Excellent Text Fleshes Out Horror,"I bought this book to augment my research for a film course I took. This book affords a concise, in-depth examination of the horror film genre and aims to identify its relevance in a historical context, psychological context, and social context. Horror films were long denied by critics as a substantial and intellectual genre worthy of scholarly research, but Kendall R. Phillips proves that they couldn't be more wrong. The films discussed in the text follow a chronological sequence, dating back to the 1920s with The Phantom of the Opera, and goes all the way up to the 90s with Scream.Excellent book for anyone interested in horror films, film history, or with an appreciation for the much broader history of American culture."
5,The movie that made Jackie a star in America,"I dont think any other Chan movie could have done a better job at introducing the American public to Jackie Chan than Rumble in the Bronx. This movie has it all. It is very funny (I love the one way mirror part in the store), lots of fight scenes which are really great, and shows off Jackie's skills on all levels. The rooftop jump is great. One of my favorite Jackie Chan fight scenes ever is the gangsters hideout. Dont think about buying this movie, just buy it! You wont be disappointed. Buy it now not tomorrow!Tomorrow tomorrow, always tomorrow! (If you've seen this movie then you know what I am talking about)"
4,A great action film,Rumble in the Bronx comes in mind as the film that brought Jackie Chan fame in America. It's not his best movie (that would be First Strike) but it's much better than most American action films. Don't watch RITB if you're expecting something serious. Almost all of Jackie Chan's movies are comedy.
3,A chinese movie for America,"Jackie chan movies used to be wonderfull, Rumble in the Bronx as been made for an American public, so it isn't so good because it is been made like Stallone or Scharze movies, I quiet like it but the real kung-fu isn't really in this film. If you like Jackie and don't know much about kung-fu, you'll like it, but the best movies are the ones that he did when he was young(drunken master, young master,ten fingers of death...)The real kung-fu movies meet with oriental traditions and not with guns."
1,Same as Mr. Nice Guy,"Don't remember purchasing this from Amazon, as it is not my type of movie. I could have purchsed it for a gift."
4,Jackie chan is the man,"One of Jackie Chan's good movies. This a decent action film. Of course Jackie's stunts stands out in this movie and that makes the movie. There are some good scenes in this movie, that's all I have to say"
2,2 out of 4.,I am not a die hard fan by any stretch so the movie can only get up to a 4 unless they use really great writing staff...but what I am most disappointed with is the cardboard case..they really should mention what the case is made out of......
3,Kicks the nice guys ass and easily beats a lot of todays movie like the trasporter 2,"my favorite oart of this movie is where jackie goes off on the wooden dummy at the start. The movie does have some great comedy bits and pretty good action parts, but it doesn't get any better than seeing how fast jackie can still move his hands, there is a chance that he still works out on a regular basis, you be the judge."
3,"Jackie is a 4, watchability a 2.","This is about 1/2 a very good movie. But it is so annowing to watch the kid and overall the mediocre production, that i can only give it a 2 star -FAIR- rating."
3,"Fun, just not good","Highly Entertaining, good for rainy days. The acting, and the jokes are horrible, but thankfully the kung fu and action scenes cancel the negatives out."
4,these movies rule!,"jackie chan must live in the hood.he runs into trouble and must kung fu flurry his way out again.kids like it.its one of his better movies in the past 10 years.the action,as always,is stupendous!his ol lady is alright but most jap and chinese chicks are.its that whole pearl cream thing i bet.i hear a lot of people talking bad on this one.f!@# them!it kicks ass!hes been making movies since like 71.doesnt that make him like 50?"
5,Fabby. The woman is a star,"Can't believe I'm the first person to review this. I *know* I'm not the first person to read it. What can I say - Ms. Day - not all apple pie. Not that she likes it anyway. If you're a doris fan, then this is a great book. It's touching, down to earth (as is the great lady herself) and is inspiring to say the least. After all this woman has had to put up with, she's still the one making our days full of sunshine. Read this and see if you don't admire her. Dare you."
4,In her own words,I enjoyed this book in part because it was in her own words. A sad story about a beautiful lady.
4,A good read,"I'm a fan of Doris Day (who isn't)and I recently finished watching the entire series of the Doris Day show. It was great to learn more about this woman and separate the characters that she plays from the woman. This book also includes interviews with costars, relatives and friends."
3,Doris Day--So-so,I liked the format Mr. Hotchner used for the book. I found Doris Day to be somewhat self centered. I liked her father and her son better then her. Their stories would be interesting.
4,The Voyage Was Too Short,"These were good. Not great, but good. The reason I don't think they are great is because there was too much focus on musicians, dancers and even acting. All of these things are wonderful and I have many DVDs with all three BUT I bought this particular set to learn more about the land of my ancestors...I wanted to see more of the villages, the country landscape, the cities. While there was some of each, it was not enough to satisfy me. They just about took a glance at The Burren and gave no information at all about this fascinating part of Ireland. Again...I'm not totally displeased with these DVDs, but I would definitely would have loved the ""Fascinating Journey Through Ireland"" that was promised, with a little more focus on places of interest and a little less focus on entertainment."
2,Vision's look alike,"This video tried to use the ""Visions"" template but fails. Although the videography is not bad, the transitions are non-existent or are very poorly done. There is a pre-occupation with Irish music and dance with long boring shots of expressionless musicians droning on with monotonous Irish music. Not enough narrative to keep your attention. Also many shots are repeated in the three discs. Content seems to be from the the early 2000's and does not reflect conditions in Ireland today at all. Just there last year and the Celtic Tiger is dead!! Would not buy again and will make someone a good deal if they wanted to buy the series!!"
3,Informative but not very exciting,I ordered these DVDS because I was traveling to Ireland and wanted to quickly catch up on the history. There is a lot of information and beautiful scenery but this did not hold our attention. Watching it after the trip will probably be more useful
3,Works Well; Very Tight Fit,The Therm-a-Rest ProLite Plus Stuff Sack provides durable and water resistant protection for the ProLite Plus mattress. As a stuff sack it does function in the way that it was designed. Having said that my two gripes with this product are:1. It should not be an add on purchase. The stuff sack should come with theTherm-a-Rest ProLite Plus Mattress. It seems that Therm-a-Rest is taking advantage of their customer base by having them purchase the sack.2. The stuff sack should be just a little bit larger because it can be difficult to fold the mattress compact enough to fit into the Therm-a-Rest ProLite Plus Stuff Sack. This is especially true if your hands are cold or injured.The Therm-a-Rest ProLite Plus Stuff Sack works as designed despite a very tight fit.
2,we shouldnt have to buy this,thermarest matresses are great but expensive. this sack should be included. shame on them for being so selfish.
5,Stuff Sackin' it up,"Well... what's there to say really?The therm-a-rest prolite stuffs into this sack quite well. No complaints, other than having to buy it separate.5/5 as of now. No quality issues, no stuffing issues, and seems to do what it was made to do quite well. Doing a backpacking trip in a week and will update and see if it all works out well...UPDATE:Stuff sack worked perfectly on my backpacking trip. I can roll up the pad very easily and have absolutely NO issues with getting it into this stuffsack. Works perfectly and is worth it for keeping that pad bundled up nicely and securely."
3,WAY overpriced,"This fits my pad well and is easy to find, but I feel dumb for buying it. It should definitely be included, as with just about every other sleeping pad. Since it isn't included it should be about 1/3 or less of this price because, let's face it, it's a sack. Good alternative to thermarest is an REI brand sleeping pad (stuff sack included)."
3,Should have just gotten a plain stuff sack.,"There is absolutely nothing special about this product. It is a very average, lightweight nylon stuff sack.Pros:lightweightCons:Barely fits the matching therma rest padExpensive"
5,One of the great Miller collections,"This one goes back to the days of long playing records. It has all the hits and some nice extras. The sound quality is excellent, but I must say, why can't these compilations of old 78's have a few more seconds between them? Essentially we have a bunch of singles all crammed together, so why not let them have some breathing room. As I recall, the UK Beatles albums from 1963-1966 had a seven second break between songs. I loved it! It was like giving each song it's own spotlight. Oh, the days of one song at a time."
2,Not what I had hoped for,"First, you need to understand that this kit does not contain all that you need for making hard cheeses. As it says in the introduction to the instruction booklet, if you are making hard cheese, you must also have cheese wax. I don't know why they would sell a kit that doesn't contain all the necessary items, but at least you are now warned.Second, the instructions are not written clearly. You would be MUCH better off getting your instructions off the Internet, and save your money.The items in the kit are of fine quality, however, and if you do not really need instructions for cheese making, then this might be fine for you."
2,Packaging Change!,"I bought this kit as a Christmas present but when it arrived, it didn't come in the cute box as pictured. The contents of the box was merely in a plastic bag - the kind you put vegetables at the grocery store. Closed with one of those wire twist ties. It does not look like a $30 gift. I don't know how good the kit is, but I would not have ordered it if I knew it would arrive like this. A note was included that said they have 'updated' their packaging."
2,Not Worth the Price,"This kit does provide the basics for making cheese. However, don't expect much in the way of quality. The equipment is flimsy, and the instructions are terrible. Instead of being fun, the cheese making process has been quite miserable. This is coming from someone who makes beer, wine, jam, etc.Save yourself some pain and suffering. Buy a good book and get your equipment elsewhere. You'll be much happier for it."
1,WTF??!!,"Ok, so i recieved the kit, it was opened previously, taped shut, the rennets were missing... SO I cant make any Cheese, and my package was tampered with... NOT THRILLED!"
2,Unclear instructions; must have certain type of milk,"I would return this if I hadn't thrown away the packaging. It's really difficult to find milk that is not ultra pastuerized where I live. I can get raw milk, but the instructions are quite vague regarding this. I haven't tried it yet since I'm discouraged before I start..."
4,good entry level kit,This is a basic kit for the beginner. It has the essentials and contains enough materials to process several gallons of milk.It was what I needed for my first attempt. This product might not be appropriate for a more experienced person.
2,Not Worthy of Gift Giving,I received my Basic Cheese Kit today and was taken aback at what I received.The box was significantly damaged and I can not give this as a gift.
3,Nice Box,We were able to make a cheese first time out but thought the kit was more hype than substance and the instructions need some fine tuning for sure
3,It's okay for the beginners.,The table of contents appears to be very complete but the actual contents are shallow with no details. The book could have been an excellent reference if the author took time to explain the programming paradigm behind the code and how one section of code is related to other areas. I recommend this book if you are trying to get your feet wet in osCommerce for the first time as a programmer with middle-level knowledge in PHP.
4,A little pricey for what it is,"I agree with the other reviewer -- a big price to pay for such a small book. I bought the book, however, I ended up returning it to the store within a day, because I couldn't see spending $27 for a 6 x 9 by half inch book. It reminded me of the exam cram books they sell for $15-$19.On a positive note, It takes the current documentation and expands upon it with some real examples. That was nice. It does make sense of the structure of OSC, if you don't have that down."
2,It may be good but it's not easy to use,"First this book is about American companies who want to do business in Japan and then with the Japanese. The author seems oblivious to the fact that a company might want to do business with the Japanese in the U.S.Second, the book has no index. For someone who is pressed for time and wants to find out the peculiarities of a particular Japanese custom, don't expect to find any advice quickly."
5,Very Frightening!!,I just had to write a short review to say this is the best horror thriller I've ever read! I still have goose-bumps thinking about it!
4,"My Name is Davy, I am an alcoholic","It is a fast paced teen oriented book. However, it is out of print and difficult to find."
4,It Showes the Chilling Truth About Alcohol,"When Davy drinks, he feels free. All of his problems disappear. It's even how he met a girl named Maxi. Maxi and Davy did everything together, they drank, they laughed, they loved. Then, Maxi started to have convulsions due to the alcohol and wanted to get help. Davy didn't think he needed it, and stopped showing up to meetings. After a tragic accident, Davy realizes his problem and gets help."
4,The Misunderstood Levellers album,"As any Levellers fan will know, the band are not particularly fond of this album (particularly Mark Chadwick). It's a lot darker than 'levelling' and 'weapon' and takes a little time to get into. I personally reckon this is one of their best especially 'The Likes of You and I' and '100 Years of Solitude'. The only bit I don't like is the annoying bagpipe solo thing at the end of 'Julie' but apart from that, it's brilliant!"
1,this could be better,"This album clearly shows that the levellers don't have any more talent than any other run of the mill folk band. They have no variation and every album is starting to sound like the last one did. This is very dissapointing as I used to like them but they just don't have what it takes, big shame."
1,bland techno junk,"like all other techno groups on the scene today this is nothing other than disco music played electronically. Those who have brains and taste in music will seek out the talented and tasteful electronic artists such as Synergy (larry Fast) Tangerine dream, vangelis, wendy carlos and others. these people paint a musical picture with multi dimensional textures that range from classical to ethnic. See how far electronic music has come. rather see what a mess it has become."
5,Groundbreaking,"Ok, so i am not the greatest fan of techno or dance music but this album is really awesome. Sound is gloomy, sometimes nihilstic but mainly dark. All the tracks are equaly good, maybe those which weren't singles even better than the ones which were, but anyway whole album has a great undergroundish sound mixed with very catchy beats. I especially love the great chill out song - ""2 kilos"". If you are looking for a good album to which you can both dance to and listen from your armchair this is it. And it surpases much to overrated ""Fat of the Land"", actually it's 10 times better..at least..."
5,MUSIC FOR THE JILTED GENERATION,"It seemed that the more I listened to music in movies, the more I asked the question, ""who are these guys?"" After reviewing soundtracks from various films, I learned the group that had drove me to ecstatic dance rushes, was now my favorite band PRODIGY. I have been a fan since the early nineties and look forward to future works. I am rating ""jilted"" as the best to date, with that being a pretty tough decision."
5,more enchantment from the essex born quartet !,"This album is incredible. Lyrical extassy and verbal infantasy take you into the enchanted and unchartered realms of the prodigy. The beats of ""their law"" will pump through your sub-woofers unlike any other sounds, as will the pace of tracks such as the likes of ""voodoo people"" and ""poison"". Then just when you thought it was all over the narcotic suite ( last 3 tracks ) should just space you out nicely."
5,Uber Kool,"I can't believe I'd never gotten around to actually listening to a whole Prodigy album. I've been a techno head since about '92, but shied away from America's mainstream frenzy of '97 when the music elite was claiming electronica would spell the end of rock. Well it didn't happen and the Chemical Brothers never quite convinced me to buy any of their full lengths, though I have a number of their individual remixes. Prodigy was different, though. Between ""Voodoo People"" and ""Firestarter"" there was plenty of reason. A few weeks ago I caught an episode of Nova on the JSF project. The music clips they used were awesome. Ironically, that week I bought a ton of used CD's, including this one. The Nova music was ""Poison""...how weird is that? The whole disk is loaded with gems and definitely a must have for anyone with even a passing interest in the genre. For someone like me it's embarrassing to only now have picked this up. And is that photo of Keith on the back hilarious, or what?!"
4,the best prodigy record!,"this is better than ""the experience"" and ""fat of the land."" Voodoo People, No Good, and One Love alone make this record rock. it's amazing how radically different the prodigy changed after this record."
4,Classic Prodigy.,"This is a must have for fan's of the Prodigy's ""Fat of the Land"", and those new to the band. Faster and darker than ""Experience"", this is an album that perfectly blends dance, rap and techno elements, making for a wicked and unrelenting ride. Stand out tracks include the spooky jungle sounds of ""Voodoo People"", and the punishing beats of the Maxim lead classic ""Poison''. This album proves that the prodigy's career did not begin with '""Firestarter""."
4,Musica 90era,"Un disco oligado para los fans de la electronica, en reallidad, el sonido Rave surgio tal ves de aqui en su manera mas elaborada, siempre he considerado a prodigy como la banda mas elaborada de la electronica, en realidad un gran disco...."
3,Dismal ( compared to fat of the land ),"After spending about a year of my life listening to fat of the land, i was expecting this to be a winner. Okay the first few tracks are ace, and share the same energy as their third album. Unfortunatley after ""the heat(the energy)"" things take a turn for the worse. After an obnoxious song that i can not listen to, you're no good for me o'r something, the rest starts to slip into some mediocre rubbish that is more suited to the chemichal brothers."
2,mostly overblown and overlong,"There's a couple good tracks on here, but this is mostly dance music, so if you're not at a ""rave"" under the influence of ""E"", then this gets very tiresome very quickly."
3,Not Quite Smacking yet.,"If you've already got ""Fat of the Land,"" and think that you're missing out on other juicey (The) Prodigy tidbits, don't worry, you're not. I bought ""Jilted"" for this very reason, and feel just that, jilted! Compared to Fat, this album sounds like parochial tinkering under the hood, regardless of the fact that the Dust Brothers handed in their (literally) two cents. I listened to this sober and didn't even want to get buzzed to give it a second shot, which is saying a lot for the state I was in the first time when I heard Fat of the Land - mega blown away! For that reason, their latest CD is best and still has me waiting for more of the same - come on (the) Prodigy! Give it up!"
5,much better than their sell-out stuff,"fotl was good, but this is loads better. get this and experience! now!"
5,This is the good stuff,"Very aggressive beat makes for this music, the whole CD as a matter of fact, to be willingly played in a loud volume and danced to. It's great stuff, a good adrenaline injection, surely. Well done to the Prodigy people."
4,Great Suspense,This is a very good movie that keeps you wondering about the connections between the different events all the way to the last minute.Great to watch and very entertaining.
3,HARD TO KEEP UP!,"THIS IS THE STRANGEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER WATCHED. I NOW KNOW WHY IT NEVER REALLY MADE IT BIG IN THE US. I LOVE PATRICK SWAYZE, AND HIS PART WAS GOOD, BUT THIS MOVIE WAS HARD TO KEEP UP TO. SO MANY STORIES GOING ON ALL AT ONE TIME. HOW ONE STORY INTERACTS ON ANOTHER IS SURPRISING. I WOULD NEVER BUY THIS DVD AGAIN. AS USUAL AMAZON FILLS QUICKLY, AND I ORDER A LOT FROM THEM."
5,Cool frickin' movie.,"Rachel Leigh Cook is a bombshell that make me want to explode. I highly recommend this movie not only on the previously stated grounds but the simple fact that it is a really good movie. It has a dark comedy edge to it, along with quality, attention keeping plot turns to keep even the squirreliest ADHD afflicted kid mouth breathing at the TV screen in complete awe. Did I mention Rachel Leigh Cook is a goddess? Scrumtrulescent."
3,"Good cast, but...","It's a good cast, but I don't think the writing and directing is up to the cast's standards. Interesting concept (even though it's been done before), but comes off as a ""B"" movie. A little confusing with the back and forth in time, but each iteration reveals a little bit more about who did what to who."
5,Awsome story,In the end you get what you deserve. A lesson in which you have nobody to blame but yourself. Can't outrun the universes circle of life! Recommend to anyone.
4,This should have made the Theaters,"The movie revolves around a series of events occurring around 11:14 p.m. in a small town called Middleton. A series of violent crimes occur in and around a 20 minute window before and after the fateful time stamp. I had not even heard of 11:14 until I saw it yesterday for rental. It looked interesting, and had a star studded cast, so I picked it up. I won't say it was the best movie I have ever seen, but it was definately worth watching. I know some people may not like seeing the same scenes from different people's perspectives, but I think it helps to tell the story clearly through all the eyes of the players. If you enjoyed Crash, you will enjoy this move. I give it 4 stars."
4,11:14,"It twist and turns ,suspence and surpries,it not what you think ,but it all comes together at the end....WOW what a ride!"
4,11.14..i love this movie,when i first saw this movie i hadn't even heard of it yet..but its a pretty funny very dark comedy that i think is a really good movie. its about all these interconnected stories that happen at 11:14 one night..worth seeing in my opinion.
4,Bolem is a JERK!,"Sometimes, telemovies of this period were nothing more than rehashes of the series that bore their name....""Rising Damp"", etc. This telemovie moved the story forward. Unfortunately, Bolem and Bewes had a falling out during this filming and now Bolem REFUSES to let the BBC or anybody else have syndication rights. Bolem's career flourished; Bewes' died. And Bolem won't allow the BBC/ITV/SKY to replay ANY of the series. Well, ""Terry Collier"" was a jerk, too. I guess Bolem was true to his part."
4,THe Arrival,"I liked this one okay, although it wasn't the funniest Animorph and to understand exactly what happened you have to read it more than once. Still, it lived up to the Animorph standered, and wasn't that predictable, a change from the recent Animorphs.I gave it four stars because, although it was a little hard to follow, it had a great plot, and the new characters were interesting, and you could definately tell they were Andalites if you've read enough Animorph books.I would suggest you read it if you're out to get all the Animorph books, or are a resident Andalite fan. Otherwise, iyou might not want to spend the money on it."
4,really good but frustrating,"I thought that this was a really good book beacause I was totally in suspence reading it and it was cool the way andalites finally came to earth, even though I dont like Ax that much this book was better than the average Ax book....the best bit was the twist at the end but it really anoyed me the way they had plenty of times when they could hav killed visser three and as usuall they didnt!I think ever since issue 23 the books have been getting worse but there still good just there not long enough.Its well worth reading though and I pretty much liked the end except I would have liked the andalites to stay and fight the war with the animorphs.Buy this book its better then the average animorph book."
3,"Good, but not as satisfying as the others","This book is sort of bad, but good in a way. It shows that Arbat inherited his brother's despiration of releasing a programmed virus to destroy Yeerks. Also, Ax falls in love and there is a strain between the Animorphs and the Andalites. All in all, I give it a 3-starred review."
3,"I'm sorry, but this ISN'T one of K. A.'s best works.","It seems that K. A. is regressing back to her old romance novels. Not that the book is that mushy or that there is a lot of romance, it's just that there isn't much action. The plot had a re-used feel to it and the Animorph's ""clever"" ploys have all been used before (like in the 20-22 trilogy.) The basic idea for the book was good, but K. A. must have been overworked when writing this. I immediately bought this book because it's an Ax book, but...well...let's just say that this isn't going to one of the ones I'm going to back and read."
3,Love Baby Einstein but......,Although my daughter does love this book - it was made poorly. The pages tend to get bent and rip off in the area next to the buttons. The music is very nice though but it doesn't hold up well if your child is at all tough on books.
1,Not much of a lullaby,"The pictures are fine, but the music is just terrible. It is very digital and harsh sounding and it is SO loud."
4,Good Modem,I bought a used one from Amazon as I was not intending to buy a new one and wanted to buy a cheap Cable Modem. The only issue is this modem is not officially supported by my internet provider (COX Communication). Whenever would call them for any issue they would just say that the modem is outdated because of which I have to argue with them and then highlight the issue to them. As far as Connectivity is concerend had not faced any issues.
2,Not as good as I expected,GOOD1) Handset sounds pretty decent although it's fairly loud even at the lowest volume setting.2) Speakerphone sounds OKBAD1) Beeps loudly everytime you push a button.2) Caller ID only shows phone number and not the name of the caller.3) My headset sounds like crap plugged into this phone.I think that I would look a little harder before purchasing this for a home office.
3,Decent 2-line phone,"This phone is pretty much what I expected. The speaker phone audio quality is passable but not exceptional, and it has all the basic features/controls needed. One thing that surprised me is that it required a 120VAC supply for a wall transformer or it would not work. The instruction manual is also awkward, saying that if your modular jack was not wired for 2 phone lines in a single jack, an adapter is required so that only a single wire goes into the phone. I'm not sure this is true because I hooked it up with a separate wire for each line and it seemed to work just fine."
2,This telephone has no answering system.. You cannot record a message or receive messages.,Wish I had read the description more carefully. This was puchased for my husband who has a hearing disability and needs a speakerphone. This telephone does not have a way of recording messages or leaving a voice message on the phone.
3,Kittens loved it but only lasted four days,"I have three kittens that are six months old. They LOVED this toy - they even have scuffles over it, even though there are many toys strewn around my house! - but alas - it only took four days for the front of the mouse to detach from the back. I'll try a different design of it next time, because my cats went crazy about this the moment that I took it off of the packaging!!"
1,Unacceptable,"I purchased this product after some decent time searching Amazon. It looked good, and had decent reviews. Upon arrival, I can say it looked good and performed well for about 2 weeks. Then, then razor portion and brass ring broke away from the handle. It was, without a doubt, a waste of money. Find something else."
3,Another controversial album!!,"Sorry for my low rating, but this time - in comparison to the impact of their best Studioalbum ""Progressivity"", I'm a bit perplexed about it!! Don't get me wrong, the product is good,the music well mixed and performed in a remarkable way (epecially regarding of theirexploration concerning the sound of their synths), but the style is radically changed, as itlooks like a kind of psichedelic genre, which sounds a bit strange for my ears... apart fromthis feature, sometimes their music is odd and very busy, but often resembling somepassages of another similar band - Brand X - in their most meditative moments, and for mesuch important elements could be enough to make this album worth checking out at least!!This is ""alternative music"" and ""relaxed fusion jazz"" in the same time, which is very interesting atthe end, so after burning this cd one more time I could give the product another halfstar...make your own choice anyway!!"
4,"Well, I LIKED it!","I thought this movie was a hoot. It had plenty of action scenes, and the final fight in the Mitsubishi factory is as good as anything Chan has ever done (and I have seen ALL his movies). Okay, so the special effects are not up to American standards--HK budgets are probably about 1/20th of your average HW budget--what do you expect? And besides, as Jackie says ""I don't use speciaw effect--I AM da speciaw effect!"""
5,One of the greatest Chan movies ever! Give it 2 thumbs up!,"The funny parts are usually when John Ma and Boomer exchange roles with each other. The ending is also suspensing, when the man with the gun thinks that there is only one Jackie Chan. But when John Ma ducks down, Boomer appears from behind him and fights off the man with the gun. In general, the content of the movie is considered so funny that it can't help but be a greatest hit! For those of you out there who are Jackie Chan fans, watch this movie!"
1,Even TWO Jackie Chan's can't save this movie,"Probably the worst Jackie Chan movie ever, it has very few fighting scenes, and only one or two even remotely Chan-like stunts. The technology to put them both on screen at the same time is awful as Chan passes through himself several times. Plus, the supporting cast is terrible, especially blue-collar Chan's sidekick. Trust me, by the time the movie is ending you'll wish he died a hundred different times. Terrible movie."
2,Not very good,"Jackie Chan's Twin Dragons is mildly entertaining but has mediocre fight scenes and humor that quickly becomes tiresome. The choreography is choppy and disorienting, rather like the overall flow of the movie. Much of the movie's humor hinges on people confusing the twin Jackie Chans for each other. It's not quite bad enough to be good, although there are some unexpectedly funny parts, such as when a man gets hit by a truck and bounces back and forth many times very quickly. But such moments are few and far between, and this is a movie best seen at most once.2/5"
4,Double the fun!,"Now double the fun with Jackie Chan. If you want twice the action that you get from Jackie Chan then this is it. Now double the stunts, double the action, and double the fun. If this doesn't impress you then there's something wrong with you."
4,Hillarous and dumb. Good fighting scenes. Predictable but very entertaining.,"This movie is hillarous even though it's dumb. It contains good fighting scenes. It's predictable but very entertaining. As other movies of this kind, if you don't suspense your logic while watching it, you won't like it. As for me, when I watch comedy, I just want to laugh. I don't care about logic.I own it."
4,"jackie chan ""twin dragons",I always enjoy jackie chan. It was fun watching him play two parts and his actions are always amazing.
3,"Jackie Chan did not direct this movie,","the reviewer from Anemhein below is wrong, Ringo Lam directed this. The movies that Jackie directed himself are his best, Young Master, Police Story and Armour Of God. SO THERE."
3,"Not his best, but worth a watch!","Twin dragons is fairly entertaining, but nothing special. Although the final fight in the car factory is fantastic!"
2,This movie is a flop,"This is one of the most boring and stupid movies, in which I have seen Jackie Chan as actor. Normally I like his movies, but this one was just only boring. There is only little of action and the sequences, which should be funny are not funny at all. Sorry Jackie but your previous movies were much better."
2,"if you like Jackie Chan, don't watch this!","i'm a big fan, but this has to be THE worst Jackie Chan movie i've seen so far... and i've seen almost all of them. it was almost painful to watch the silly situations the twins got themselves into, and beyond belief that they couldn't figure things out. i would have given it 1 star except the fight scene at the end was pretty good."
1,I can't describe how bad this movie is...,"I like Jackie Chan a lot in movies like ""Rush Hours"" and the new ""Shanghai Noon"". He's charming, sharp and amazingly fast. But any movie that Jackie directs really sucks big time. The story is usually childish, silly and the supporting Chinese actors always ""overact"". I'm very disapointed that in this day and age, Jackie still releases something like ""Twin Dragons"". When the other twin plays piano, this twin's hand shakes is the most stupid idea/joke I've ever seen. I had to shut it off and watched regular TV instead. It pissed me off for having to rush to the video store to get this movie. My message to Jackie Chan: ""Please avoid stupid stories like this one! Better yet, let someone else direct your movies for the International audience"""
2,Bad re-edit of a fun film,For some reason when it was released in the US this year they decided to edit out most of the comedic scenes and most anything not directly involving Jackie Chan from the earlier release. They also almost totally replaced the soundtrack with music that for the most part didn't match the scene. I like Jackie Chan films but this release was very disapointing. The only up side was that the voices were re-dubbed by I think by the original actors. The action is still good but the older versions of the film are better.
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,DAMN! This movie put me to sleep. I am a die hard Jackie fan but this movie jsut plain ol' sux. Sorry Jackie but i can't defend you in this one. DAMN THIS MOVIE IS STUPID! Ok back to sleep for me.ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
1,The worst of recent Jackie Chan movie,Jackie Chan's movies are always entertaining but with weak plots. But the plot of this movie is the worst of all. It is completely without any story at all.
2,Worst Jackie Chan movie I have seen in a Long Time,If you are thinking of buying this DVD. DON'T!!! This is one of the worst Jackie Chan movies made yet. Usually I really like his movies but this didn't live up to the good name of Jackie Chan. There were scenes where they didn't edit out the line between between the images of Chan. And people would faint at the drop of a hat!!! It looked like it was just thrown together at the spur of the moment. I blame the director and the editor of this movie.
3,important book for young feminists-to-be...+,"why is it that young girls give up their identity before they have even found it? G Beckman writes about the importance of finding it, and holding on to it , even though it can be hard, when you so much need and want the acceptance of the surrounding people. When you have only little time left to live, you can't spend it on being nice, have to find your self, no matter the cost!"
4,What a good book.,I read a lot of the Babysitters Club books when I was younger and I really remember this one. I used to move a lot and I really liked Kristy and the way she handled things with these people that she was different from. It's one of the plots that I really remember pretty well.
4,this was a very moving and intriging book,"I thought it was very realistic i could relate to Kristy moving to a different neighbourhood, it must of been hard. Some parts of the book were cruel, like the war between Kristy and Shannon but very sad too-poor Louie!!!"
1,ANN M. MARTIN SHOULDN'T CALL PRIVATE SCHOOL KIDS SNOBS!!!!!,ANN M. MARTIN IS INSULTING MY FRIENDS AND I WHENEVER SHE CALLS PRIVATE SCHOOL KIDS SNOBS. WE ARE NOT SNOBS JUST BECAUSE OUR PARENTS SEND US TO PRIVATE SCHOOL
3,Not what I thought,"The title of this book sounded good to me when I was in 6thgrade. It was pretty entertaining, and interesting. Kristy is good athandling snobs. However, I went from one private school to the next in grade school, on and off, and 7th grade and those kids aren't always snobs. Sure they worry about dumb stuff like the cars you drive (at least the teenagers do) but not all of them are rich. It has nothing to do with wealth. Some of the kids I went to private school had maybe one pair of jeans and one pair of shoes, and a few second-hand shirts. That's it. Some of them were snobs though--the rich kids who get driven to school in Mercedes Benz. Another thing: Kristy and her family should've kept Louie's collar."
5,Nobody's gonna tell Kristy what to do--especially the Snobs!,"Kristy's mom got married again last summer and now Kristy and her family live in a new neighborhood. The kids aren't very friendly. In fact, they're...well, snobs. They criticize Kristy's clothes. They make fun of the Baby-sitters Club. And worst of all, they laugh at Louie, Kristy's pet collie, who's going blind. Nobody does that and gets away with it!"
2,not great,"I thought that this book was very inconsiderate by saying that private school kids are always snobby and disrespectful, and that is absolutely not true. Just because a kid goes to private school doesn't mean that they are snobbish and stuck up."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this book because the movie ""Foreign Student"" (starring Robin Givens) was based off of this book. Sadly the book has little to do (in context) with the movie. I actually stopped reading about halfway through because, after reading that much, I was expecting it to get into the meat-and-bones of the love story between April and ""Frenchie"" but it was just taking too long. This book seemed to focus mainly on mundane details of the main characters new and strange southern surroundings. One interesting thing that did happen in the book that didn't happen in the movie at all was one of ""Frenchie's"" new friends committed suicide in some weird deviant sexual manner."
2,Waste of Money,"I purchased this book when it first came out and within a month learned that there were so many errors that I spent hours printing out the incorrect pages to include in my copy. Sharon Alderman has always been a favorite weaver and writer of mine, however, someone sure should have done some proof reading before this hit the bookstores. As far as I am concerned, due to the errors, and I don't know if I do have all the corrections, the book is now worthless. Note that it did have a big price tag on it when first published."
5,Best weaving book out there,"This latest entry into the ""only weaving book you'll need"" wins! It's not for absolute beginners. But it will provide intermediate-beginner weavers all the information they need to understand and move beyond plain weave. The drafts and photographs are fantastic!"
5,Essential Book,This book is an essential entry to your weaving library. Sharon has done a lifetime of research and work in weaving and this book is the demonstration of her vast knowledge. I am positive that I will reference it for the rest of my time spent weaving.
5,Pleased with the Customer Service,"I received my product in a timely manner from this seller. Its' condition was just as described. As for the music......well, you will have to judge for yourself. I like it!!!!!!"
2,It's ok,"This book is proof that, if you have an established name, you can publish something which is not very good.This isn't awful, it's not dreck, it's just not very good. No real depth of character, so, as you can't really care about the cardboard figures, there is no sense of tension, nor is there surrender to the world and people created. I was quite disappointed."
4,"A Nice, Eclectic Mix of Covers","There are some fine covers here of Jimmie Rodgers. David Ball's ""Miss the Mississippi"" is wonderful. The only clunker to me is Van Morrison's ""Mule Skinner Blues."" It's a little repititious and annoying, which is a shame because Van usually delivers. You will probably find one or two songs you really like and and one that you won't. Is it worth it? Sure. Most of the artists get into and celebrate JR the right way. Go for it."
1,Hard Drive crashes,"As with all reviews, I had many songs recorded and was in the process of backing them up to the FAT partition (to move to my computer) and it just stopped working saying ""HDD not found, please power down."" Now it does not work at all---it will not move beyond the startup screed. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT--YOU WILL LOSE YOUR SONGS AT SOME POINT!"
5,Got to have the knobs,"A major plus is setting the eq knobs to a certain frequency, and not having to go through a menu. You can always see where they are, and can adjust while playing back. For what i do, i just can't imagine not having those eq knobs. I'm going to buy another one. You just have to pay attention to what goes in, and you will have quality recordings. I use a microverb for a small amount of ambience, and it's all i need. I've tried many recorders, and i just have no interest in learning the ropes on another one. I guess people like different products for different reasons, and this recorder just happens to be a perfect fit for me. So what if you fill it up; grab another one for 100 bucks."
2,"Pretty Cool, If It Would Work","Before I bought this item I saw a few reviews of it online commenting on how after the user purchased the Tascam DP-01, a short time later it would crash and the user would lose everything that that they had written and recorded on it. I ignored these reviews, purchased the DP-01, and began recording music onto it. A few weeks later, the DP-01 crashed and not only did I lose everything I had recorded but I also could no longer record anything new. I will give it two stars because it was relatively easy to figure out and use. Besides the crashing feature that seems all to common, it is a pretty decent product. But if you do decide to buy this item, be sure to save everything on a back-up disk."
1,"Yep, this is a worthless product.","I've experienced the same hard drive problems. It stopped being able to read the disk during only my third extended period of usage. I'm still trying to get in touch with somebody at Tascam about the problem. They're hard to get a hold of. Awesome work, Tascam!"
4,uplifting and engaging,This story is a real pick me up. It's beautifully told and beautifully illustrated. This would make a perfect gift for someone you care about. But it's biggest impact on me was it's message. It's a fascinating little story that makes me feel fantastic.
4,Great for the Price,"The transport wheelchair is exactly as advertised; light weight and easy to place in/out of the car and to assemble. Most transport chairs have four small wheels while this one has the 2 larger back wheels which makes it easier to maneuver. I am very pleased with this purchase and would purchase again. I was particularly pleased with my experience with the seller, JDC. I had to return the original one I had purchased as it was damaged in shipping. They were quick to replace it and pleasant in all my contacts with them."
1,Repeat Recipes,I found this book to have repeat recipes from some other crockpot cookbooks. Nothing original in this book. Poor editing and the ink looks faded very bad publishing and bad quality for a cookbook. I returned it and got something else.
1,Don't Like,I bought this and found out that allot of the cooking times were off and my dishes were under cooked. I also noticed that the ink on the printing of the book was faded and looked like it was copied. Don't waste your money on this cookbook.
4,Disappearing Recipes,"We like the recipes, but have never had a cookbook's ink run off the page. This must be a cheap, ink-jet job that has a fatal flaw: use it while prepping at your own risk."
2,disappointing,"This book is very disappointing. My main complaint is that many of the recipes call for ingredients such as frozen vegetables, canned soup, mayonnaise, and one which actually calls for an entire bottle of Catalina salad dressing. This really is not my style of cooking. Another reviewer commented that a lot of recipes need something done throughout the cooking process or are partially cooked on the stove before being put into the Crockpot. This was a big turn off for me too. I suggest trying a different book."
2,Not good for people who work all day,"I was not happy with this cookbook because many of the recipes required that I do something during the day with the recipe, like stir it at 4 hours into cooking, or cook something on a stove then put it in the slow cooker. I work 100 hour work weeks and I really need something quick and easy, and this book did NOT have many recipes that were quick or easy. I was so upset with it I had to write in to give the warning out."
4,Nice pearls,"The pearls were nice. In some lights, they don't look as purple as I thought they should. But my wife loved them, which is the ultimate point, I guess."
5,Worth the Risk!,"How I loved the characters and how their stories unfold and intertwine! So well written, I could visualize the neighborhoods and settings and feel the moods of the characters as well as envision their surroundings. It's as the jacket describes: we sense the physical and psychological violence that lies just beneath the veneer of southern hospitality. Surely there's a sequel in the making. Even if not a sequel to RISKING ELIZABETH, I look forward to Mr. McCloskey's next novel."
2,Writer's first efforts,"Although ""Risking Elizabeth"" had a good enough storyline, it was at times a tedious read. The writing style was stilted, as the author sought simplistic ways to reveal historical information about the characters. For example, a character would say something like, ""Grandmother, tell me about the time that so and so did thus and such....."" Also, the story's characters weren't realistically drawn, as they would, in the middle of a tense and dramatic episode, sit down and have a delicious meal, fully described by the author. It was an okay read for the beach, but it shouldn't be taken as a serious literary effort."
5,"Nice product, Nice price",I came across this listing while searching for prices on AV cables. This was one of the lowest in price and took a chance on it. When it arrived it worked just like all the others I have. I will surely consider buying this product again if the need for more cables arise.
2,R.I.P. (rest in pieces),"My boxer/lab, a year old, took a little longer than usual to tear this one apart and spread stuffing throughout the house. It's advertised as stuffing-free but the head and tail are stuffed. It comes with removable and extra squeakers, something I've never seen. If your dog isn't prove to ""plushie-cide"", you'll love it."
2,Shredded after day 1,"My dog liked it.........too much. I did expect more from a KONG product. It has taken 2 weeks, but it is now completely gutted, inside out, with every attachment gone (that was day 1). There was stuffing in it somewhere, contrary to the description; this is all gone too. Now he's working on ripping up the fabric. Soon it will be no more."
