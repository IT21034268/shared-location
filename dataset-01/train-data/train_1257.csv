5,Great For Breads Or Meats,"This is a great all-around slicer. We've used it on very soft, moist cakes and breads - both soft and crusty.But, thanks to a sharp edge and the length, it does a great job on meats. It breezes right through a London Broil and does a beautiful job slicing up an entire beef tenderloin into individual filet mignons. Sharp enough and long enough that you can usually complete a cut in a single stroke, providing a cleaner cut. I even tried it on a turkey last Thanksgiving and it worked great.One really nice feature of this blade over many other slicers (including some other Wüsthofs) is that it is scalloped on only one side, so you can still take it to a steel between professional sharpenings."
5,sturdy go-to workhorse for large items,"Often enough there's a watermelon or big round loaf of bread or turkey or some other thing that's broad enough that I can't quite get any of my ""regular"" knives through it in one downward motion. It's awkward when you have to cut things by halves, trying to meet in the middle, etc. Or sometimes I just need the leverage of a long blade for some reason. That's when I turn to my super slicer. It has yet to be bested by anything in my particular kitchen. It cuts great, is sturdy, sharp, menacing even. I love it."
4,A good reference for Shakespeare scholars,"Levith's survey of Shakespeare's plays set in Italy is a good starting point for scholarly data for researchers interested in the use of Italy in Elizabethan and Jacobean drama. The different roles Italians and the Italian culture plays in portraying the current English are discussed, as well as the Italian works that sit as the origins for many of Shakespeare's canon. This is a wonderful reference to have on the shelf and can help anyone from the undergraduate level up."
3,,"After their essential `Greatest Hits' compilation from last year, Necrodeath are ready to put themselves in the map with 100% Hell, an album that's representative of the title for many obvious reasons. The band's brand of thrash metal remains intact, but they play it with a modern approach. The old-school spirit is still there, combined with groovy parts and short, precise songs. Commanding, classic Slayer-esque portions inject the songs with deadly fury, while the vocals are suitable for nature of the music. Flegias' voice sounds identical to Shagrath of Dimmu Borgir, giving it a blackened feeling to the material. Excellent effort by these Italian thrashers. 3.5/5"
3,50% Hell,"After hearing Master of Morphine, I thought this album was going to own. Wrong. It is satisfactory and nothing more. I would suggest downloading MoM and not buying this cd. New Necrodeath has been a let down for me."
4,Same ol' Necrodeath,"I usually don't write a review on an item when others have, but this is an exception only because I strongly disagree with the others.I Have purchased every Necrodeath since Mater of Evil and these guys haven't changed. They all sound the same (except for Ton(s) of Evil which I did not like). The guitars and production is outstanding but like I said, all sound the same(even with the new guitarist.)I don't care if the label is ""black metal"", Flegias has to go. You can't understand his sreechy/raspy voice and it is not like I am looking to have a ""sing-a-long"". Basically, you are buying the disc for the music. I love the ""wall of guitars"" sound, but after the fourth disc, I would like some discernable vocal. Please notice that I gave this a four star rating even though it sounds like I do not like them. The bottomline is that the guitars, sound, music and production are outstanding and typical Necrodeath (black thrash) which I like and will still buy."
3,Tantalising but just misses the mark,"The power of Hundertwasser's vision is there, in the illustrations in this book. Even in the difficult text there are glimpses of a coherent summation of what the man was about. But the clunky translation, really transliteration, which fails to use clear Anglo-saxon phrases instead of over-inflated terminology, makes the text at times impenetrable and pretentious. This is a pity, because I suspect the tone in the original language was clear and passionate.On the whole, however, it was good enough as a first exposure to Hundertwasser, to make me want to explore this amazing and relevant man further."
3,King James go grunge,"Released in 1997, ""The Fall"", was King James sophomore album. After several seconds of the record, you can tell they totally dropped the melodic rock approach, and jumped on the grunge bandwagon full-force.While ""The Fall"" is not a terrible album, it definitely is nothing like either Rex or Jimi are known for. Honestly, after several listens to the record, I swear it sounded like King James kidnapped Alice In Chains and recorded an album. I did like some songs from the record though, ""The Fall"", ""Never Is Forever"", and ""Heaven Is For Everyone"" were solid enough.This isn't my type of music at all, but some people may actually like the direction King James went with the album. Most melodic rock fans, like me, won't though."
1,I was completely disappointed.,"I bought ""The Fall"" by KING JAMES when it was released, and it is simply awful. I hate GRUNGE-type music, and that is what this is. Can you imagine my dismay and disappointment at finding that they completely changed their sound? The First release has some great Hard Rock/Metal songs on it. This one, I listened to the entire CD, put it back in the case, and I have never listened to it since. Yes, I thought it was that bad.If I could give this one ZERO STARS, I would. I just completely hate this style of music. Sorry Rex, I loved WHITECROSS - you should have gone back to that rather than releasing this."
4,Good CD,"Not 100% my type of genre, but it's pretty good. Not Rex Carroll's (guitarist) typical genre, but it still came out good. I guess he can do anything."
3,Not Calligraphy Pens,"This is a set of fine point roller ball drawing pens. They seem nice enough, but what I wanted and what I expected to receive was a set of calligraphy pens. These seem to be really nice quality pens, but they are not calligraphy pens. I'll have to continue my search."
4,Bellissime Canzoni!!!,This is a great CD! Raf's words are very heartfelt and meaningful. I especially love listening to it on rainy days or when I'm down. I definetly reccomend it.
1,does not cool,"It is extremely noisey even on the low setting, but worse is that it does not even cool. IT didn't seem to cool at all so I let it run all night in an attempt to cool down a small room, the next morning the room was 1 degree cooler than the other rooms. A fan would do similar work and have less noise and cost."
3,Broken Promise,"As much as I love Dan, this CD was disappointing. If you have other Dan CDs, you already have the best of this one."
3,ESL Chinese (Cantonese) English for Chinese Speakers,"As a ESL Teacher who works with students around the world this book was moderately helpful to persons who I tutored on a volunteer basis.The first few chapters start of with the basics but additional exercises are required to aid prounciation.The layout of the book could be modified only by rearranging chapters, placing one before another but all in all I believe all the details and exercises are adequate.It is unfortunate that another booklet with a higher level isn't offer."
1,Not what was pictured,"The Thai yellow bean paste pictured is not the brand that was sent. In fact, not sure what was sent was bean paste because the label is totally in a forign language. We are very familiar with the brand that is pictured becasue we buy it locally in the Aisian MArkets.The brand sent was not the brand advertised in the photo"
3,not great,it's a cup.. but it didn't really fit perfectly under the juicer like i assumed it would. i wouldn't get it again
3,Camera Case,Camera does fit the case well. Quality could be better but at the price of purchase was OK. Shipping and handling charge was excessive. I would not order again because of the higher than normal handling and shipping add-on that turns a good deal into a poor one.
1,not a good design,interior is not well designed. does not protect knives from each other. does not protect knives from cutting bag. returned it immediately for refund.
2,"Review from the ""Line""","I am a line cook and have this bag for 3 months. I carry this bag to work w/ me everyday. And unfortunately..... First off its already falling apart. Seams are coming undone, things you would understand are normal wear and tear but you'd also expect it to last more than three months. Secondly; I've noticed this comment made, it doesn't come w/ a strap. Funny thing is it has a ring on each end of the bag for a strap to connect to? Third the quality isn't strong enough to withstand knives that are in fact sharp. The material itself is to fragile to place sharp knives into w/o having blade savers or a soft cover, which will dull the blade anyways.This is a great bag though if you don't travel a lot w/ your knives. If your using this knife roll for storage than this would work fine, otherwise I'd recommend spending the extra money on something that will last."
2,"Good, but far from, the best.","Road depiction is very vague. Difficult to read. Somewhat useable with AAA maps. For the best maps see the series by Benchmark Maps. I have used their maps in California, Washington, Oregon, Arizona. Unfortunately, they do not have many states. I use the Delorme ""Utah"" with my AAA maps."
4,"Just like all Delorme Atlases, it's great","I'm planning a trip to California shortly, but I lived there for many years as a child. The Delorme for Northern California joins my collection of about 10 other Delorme maps for other areas I have lived and visited. Being a birdwatcher, we in the birding community often give directions to birds by Delorme pages. Makes life SO much easier. Although it doesn't have every little street in some areas, it does have MUCH more detail than the average road map, and makes it wonderful when you're like me and just want to head off in a general direction to scout for bird territory, but not necessarily follow the same path back. Love Delorme Atlases... wouldn't travel without them."
2,Delorme Disappointment,"We are knee-deep in genealogical research including location of real properties bought and sold by our ancestors in Northern California as well as other States. The Washington State Atlas and Gazateer has been an invaluable resource for us in Washington since it provides a range and township system so one can zero in on an actual piece of real estate given the land description. We were very disappointed when our Northern Cal. Atlas and Gazateer arrived to find it had no such system. If one is looking only for detailed maps, this atlas and gazateer would be o.k."
3,Hobbit co-star,"I bought this costume for my daughter so she could pretend with her brother to be characters from ""The Hobbit."" The costume was pretty enough, but it is cut so widely, especially at the neck, that I have had to pin it up to keep it on her shoulders and pull it up because the neckline is very low. Disappointing to have to refit the costume every time she wears it. She is a size 7."
4,Stand Out,This book is outstanding! Very motivating and informative. I encourage anyone trying to make an impact in their industry to read this!
5,A GREAT REFERANCE BOOK FOR ALL PROFESSIONALS,"This is a kind of book that one can refer to over and over again. It is not only useful for professionals but anybody who desires to improve his life, image, friendships,etc.This book is about integrity, self respect and finding the uniqueness in ourselves, since we are all unique in one way or another. The importance of being focused, relaxed and all the other strategies and advices in this book are priceless! Roya says this is an excellent book for any body at any stage of his/her life whether they are in business or not!"
5,A Useful Book to Help Business Professionals Create a Niche,"In this easy-to-read guide to branding yourself in your business, Vetter provides a wealth of information and practical suggestions in creating yourself as a brand in the marketplace. It is a must-read and should occupy a central place on the bookshelf of anyone looking to start or build their business in a way that produces results!"
1,Looks like a bunch of fake reviews,"Most of the reviewers for this book have reviewed only one book ... that's right, this one! A few people who have reviewed more than one book don't seem to like this book. Amazon ought to make it more difficult to post fake reviews."
2,Stand Out! Branding Strategies for Business Professionals,"I found this book to be less helpful than many other books on self-branding. The personal profiles, which are a dominant part of the book, are all from the professional speaker/trainer/personal coaching world. I didn't think these had much relevance to people outside that industry who are looking for insights and direction to guide their self-brand building efforts."
3,Three and a half stars-Fun and attractive,"Great item for spices, and perfect if you have the possibility of adding more spices later, since you can stack the. The labels are great, but there are some key spices missing on the list. It would be nice if the gave you a blank sheet to print on. Sometimes it seems that more than one wants to come out when you are going for just one, but looking at the design I sort of expected that. The star deduction is for 2 reasons. 1-some of the containers had the plastic front not in place, so I had to fix the,. I thought it would be a better quality than that. Also, I don't think the measurement works all that great. For example, I measured out Cinnamon and poured it in. I shook the jar to get any extra out, and it continually shakes out more and more. I imagine I could have shaken out the entire jar if I wanted, and I'm positive this is a design flaw. All in all, it looks great in our kitchen, and I'm happy-particularly for the price."
2,"Messy, messy, messy","I really liked the concept but after having these for several months I am disappointed. They are very messy, especially with spices such as cinnamon, clove, etc. I am constantly cleaning the holder and the container."
1,Cheaply made,"From the picture's I thought it looked well made and I was excited to get it. After opening it I won't even use it. Very cheaply made, I broke one of the spice holders when checking it out. I'll probably end up giving it to someone I hate for Christmas =)"
1,"EXTREMELY Cheap, poorly made",This product is extremely cheap. The plastic lids do not fit onto the spice containers well and the front plates were falling off when we opened it. The turning wheels to dispense measured amounts were stuck and had to be pushed very hard to get it to turn. I will be returning this item.
3,Love them but they leak,"I love everything about them. They are mountable OR stack. I have them mounted, 2 under one cabinet. Fits nicely, spins well. Herbs stay fresh. The only thing I do not like is that they leak, all the time. Whether I'm using just the top portion or not, doesn't matter. As soon as you touch them, they leak. I loved the idea or pre-measuring from 1/4 tsps, but it doesn't execute that idea very well. Still keeping them; still love them, however, I won't be using the 1/4 tsps and will be sealing them all up with a screwdriver. Stinks I can't use that part of it, but its making a consistant mess! =o( Would be a 5 other than that."
2,Great Space Saver **But Not Air Tight**,"I got one of these for my mom for Christmas and she loved it. She says it opened up so much space in her cabinet and she no longer has to shift things around to find the right spice. I'm back again ordering two more for her. Her only complaint is that the auto-measure dial is incredibly stiff at first and needs to be worn in a little bit, but she prefers the shaker or pour holes anyway. Other than that, this is a great product!**One Year Update**The product is not as great as I originally thought. It is not air tight, allowing spices to be exposed to moisture, and become clumpy."
2,Kind of cheap,This is not at all what I expected for the money I paid. It is cheap plastic and lightweight. You can't pick it up by the handle cause it falls off when you do. Wouldn't buy for this price again...would pay maybe half.
1,"cheap, missing a part, leaky","Nice idea, if it were made properly. The metalic plastic was missing from one of the containers, the metalic plastic ring on top popped off right away. Have not even put spices in it, because I could see that they are not airtight containers. I'm returning the item."
1,Cheap,"This product looked nice so I added it to my wedding registry, but it's actually really cheap. The spice containers don't dispense very well and the handle doesn't stay on. Not to mention when I opened it there were scratches on the screens and the top silver piece was popped off with a bunch of gross glue exposed. Not happy with what we got to say the least."
2,received returned damaged product,So far I like the spice rack. I mounted it under the cabinet. It works well and saves me space. These are not air tight spice containers but they are for my commonly used spices so that is not a problem to me.My gretest problem is that I received one that had been returned damaged. The seller shipped it back out with a broken collar. Also it was put back in the box upside down so it was very hard to get out of the box.I glued the collar back on and because of the cabinet mount the crack cannot be seen. Still I think that the seller should have managed their property better and they should not have reshipped a returned product without inspecting it.The decorative collar came off my new dispenser as well but it was not broken and only had to be reglued.
2,bad design and hard to maintain,I got this because of the positive reviews but i hate it. I was too cheap though the pictures look great. The parts easily come off and they are small so you cannot even fix it properly.
2,"Great concept, poorly executed","I loved the idea of these, so bought 2 to stack. However, they leak like crazy, especially if you use the auto-measuring/dispensing feature for powdery spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, etc.) I wish I'd read the reviews before purchasing."
3,It's all according to the product description; But I just didn't like it.,"It's all according to the product description; But I just didn't like it, because it's not handy. Not user friendly. Won't recommend."
1,NOT STAINLESS STEEL!!!!! - PLASTIC!,"Very disappointed. The item description misrepresents this spice carousel. I bought 2 of these so I could stack them. Pulled the first one out of the box and knew right away this is not what I expected. The front of one of the canisters came off. The handle would not go on flush. THIS IS PLASTIC PAINTED TO LOOK LIKE STAINLESS STEEL. The concept is great but the manufacturing quality is NOT. It is flimsy and not sturdy at all. Sending them BACK. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!! If Amazon is smart, they will take this item out of their inventory or at least, correct the item description. I wish there was a way to give this NO stars! One is too much!"
1,Doesn't work well at all. Don't buy.,Did the purchase and the countainers really leak. I did a purchase of 2 racks and was very interested by the model but really not work at all and will always be all dirty.
2,"Very, very leaky. Cheap plastic, ugly when mounted.","Very dissatisfied with this product. The main problem is that the containers leak horribly with anything powdered. Cinnamon and Paprika were the worst in my containers. If you shake the container over food without opening it, you can easily apply a good amount of spice. That's a problem. The plastic is really cheap feeling. It feels like you could break the containers into 5 pieces if you squeezed it too hard. I initially mounted the rack under my counter, but it was hanging at least an inch lower on one side because of the cheap warped plastic. This product is a great idea, but absolutely horrible delivery. The auto-mesures don't work for larger spices, and the smaller ones leak. Tightening the bottom screw will NOT solve the leak problem. Mine are leaking from all seams, and not just a small amount."
2,"Great concept, efficient, elegant design.. terrible containers","The negative reviews here said much (if not all) of what I would say.PROS- Love the spinning design, mostly efficient use of space- Looks beautiful, rotates wellCONS- Cheap, crappy plastic- NOT airtight, spices will leak- In hot, humid weather, you run the risk of your spices solidifying. I lost a full thing of garlic powder and onion powder to this unit, once those powders solidify, they're never the sameThis item would be perfect if not for the inattention to detail in the actual design of the containers. I'll be switching back to something sealed sealed."
1,A piece of trash,"The KitchenArt Pro Auto-Measure Spice Carousel is a worthless piece of trash. I put my spices in it and with days they were as hard as a rock. I could not get most of them out. The product is cheaply made, does not keep moisture or humidity from your expensive spices. The plastic window on the front pops off, at least it did on three of mine. If it were possible, I would give it less then the 1 star it got. I ended up tossing it and a lot of expensive spices in the trash. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF TRASH."
3,Nice idea,"I am on the hunt for another spice rack. I bought two of these and stacked them. They looked great and I used them all the time. However, I got some type of beetle in my kitchen and lo and behold, they were munching on my spices. These are not air tight, so gross little bugs feasted on my spices and the whole thing went into the trash. Think air tight before you spend your money on these."
3,Great Idea,"I have the white rack like this that I've had for several years. No problems with it. I just updated my kitchen with stainless appliances and bought this one to match my new kitchen. The front came off some of the shakers as soon as I took it out of the box. And there is a latch on the bottom of the shaker that you have to move before you can measure, which is hard to move and will be very unhandy. Looks great, however, not as well made as the one I've had for years and not as useful!!"
1,DON'T WASTE MONEY!!!,"I PURCHASED THIS SPICE RACK AS A GIFT BECAUSE IT LOOKED SO PRETTY AND PRACTICAL. BOY WAS I WRONG!!! I OPENED IT TO SEE WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE AND AS SOON AS I TOOK IT OUT OF THE BOX, THE WHOLE THING FELL APART!!!!!. THE SILVER PIECE AROUND THE HANDLE FELL OFF IMMEDIATELY.L THEN THE SILVER PIECES AROUND THE JARS AND THE CLEAR PLASTIC PIECES FELL OFF. THEN THE JARS WOULD NOT FIT BACK INTO THE RACK. NEEDLESS TO SAY, I AM SENDING IT BACK AND NEVER PURCHASING ANOTHER KITCHENART PRODUCT. I USUALLY DON'T PURCHASE ANYTHING WITHOUT FIRST READING THE REVIEWS. I WISH THAT I HAD SEEN THE REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING THIS ONE. SO DON'T WAST YOUR MONEY!!!! I WISH THAT I COULD GIVE IT NO STARS BUT ONE STAR IS THE LOWEST POSSIBLE RATING."
3,Spice Carousel,"This is an interesting concept, but not the best product. Sometimes spices clump up and the measuring part can be hard to turn. Is decorative, though."
3,misleading,I was extremely disappointed when I received this product! I assumed it was stainless steel satin to match the appliances in my kitchen as stated and was suprised to see that it's plastic with a sprayed stainless look! I'm glad someone else is enjoying it since it wasn't even worth sending it back to Amazon!
4,Nice Spice Rack,"Very nice spice rack, although it did not come with spices, it is a perfect carousel that fits in the cabinet. Not big and bulky like all the other commercial ones. I would recommend this brand."
1,Wasteful,I'm very disappointed in this labeler. It wastes tons of label tape because there isn't a way to change the blank tape margin. It wastes about half of each tape cassette.
4,I like the combination of PC and Standalone,"Like many others have noted, you need to be smart to not waste tape. Tape is not cheap. That said the labels are very high quality. There are plenty of text/font options. I have not worked with this enough to see how good the battery life is--with NiMh so I only expect so-so performance. It will be fine for me.LED is pretty poor but usable.Finally, the printer goes offline quickly and I have to remember to turn it on even though it is in the charging station. I have not yet found out how to change this, but it is a minor annoyance since it turns on quickly."
4,Good for getting a new perspective,"The author had a definite aspect of the prophetic writings to highlight: as they related to Power and Liberation.I definitely got some new insights from the Hebrew prophets. The vocabulary could have been a little more versatile(there must be synonyms to the word 'liberation', which appeared very frequently) but the thrust and the content were helpful to me."
3,Power in the Prophets,"A study of Power with its capacity to dominate, liberate or engender harmony, with the prophets assigned to one of three groups: those whose power is patriarchal (which is unacceptable, those whose power is directed to liberation (which is inadequate), and those for whom power is shared harmoniously between God, humanity and the natural world, leading to the transformation of all creation, which Dempsey believes is the only way to lasting peace. Selected texts are then interpreted according to their category which means that we are always in danger of interpretation according to our pre-conceived ideas."
5,Great Resource!,"I teach autistic children and these books are a great resource. There is some work involved in putting these together, but it is completly worth it if you can laminate the games. They will last forever. The games are wonderful for generalizing mastered skills such as numbers, letters, matching, colors, and more. The social studies book for K-3 even has social skills in it! I see the value of this product for regular education as well. It is worth the money!"
3,Good Pet door for Cat or Small Dog,"This is a nice pet door. Big enough for a fat cat or small dog, but the description is lacking some information. The door can not be adjusted to fit different thickness of walls. It is perfect if you are going to cut a hole in a 1"" thick wooden door or wall. But if the door or wall is not that thick then you have to comensate, and It will not expand so it is not made to be use in a wall thicker than 1"".."
4,Perfect for my larger cat but they don't like the hard flap.,"I needed this for an indoor application to allow my cats to get to the basement for the litter box and food. One of my cats is a very large breed and is over a foot tall and weighs 17 lbs so I needed something big enough for him. My other cat is much smaller so I needed to be able to mount this at a height that was a compromise for them. Very easy to mount and looks great installed on my basement door.The only negative is my cats hated the hard plastic flap. I read several reviews about letting them get used to it, but after a day I just removed the flap and all is well. Now that they are using it I thought about putting the flap back on but have decided since it is an indoor application to just leave it as is.I did buy a second one as I have basement refinishing happening and will need another access point. I am very pleased with the purchase as this does exactly what I needed and it looks great."
3,"Works great sans door, clips tail with it","Perfect size for a medium sized cat. This is easily installed with a jig saw and works great without the door in. When it got cold we added the door as to avoid drafts from the basement... The cats did get used to it, but it pinches their tail unless they go through either really slow or really fast."
4,Awesome cat door,This door was up in 5 minutes since I used an oscillating tool which I recommend everyone get and use for projects like this. Nonetheless it went up without a hitch and looks great. I do wish the screws were on the opposite side from the lock as I have the lock on one side of a door and it is the main room. I would have preferred that the screws were on the other side. That one nitpick aside this door does as it is supposed to. My cats love it and prefer being able to see through the flap unlike my old cat door. This is well worth the money.
3,"Easy to install, bad lock.","As many other people have already stated the door is really simple and easy to install. We installed our on a storm door, and it was so easy! However the down side is that the lock does NOT keep the cats out. No matter how well you lock it, if the cats press on it hard enough it will unlock itself and they can come in. I remedied this problem by putting a bar infront of the door to easily slide in and out of place...but still, if you are looking to put this in a place where you are worried about other animals trying to get in your home, or you think you may want to keep your pets locked out now and again...keep on looking, THIS IS NOT the door for you."
4,The Basset Hound Gets Through It Even When It is Locked,"Our big cat gets bigger every winter, so this door is nice for him. However the dog can get it open even when have locked it, and she can squeeze through. Wish it was a built a bit sturdier, although we appreciate having a larger door for fat cats."
4,Good door,"This was pretty easy to install. We did end up taking the plexiglass off because one cat was scared of it, and the other one got his paw stuck in it because of the magnet."
3,"Perfect for my tubby cat, but . . .","This is the perfect size for my interior pet door, to let Tubby go in and out, and to keep my dogs out of their room. However, the screws provided are too big, and I cannot, using a hand or electric screwdriver, screw them in all the way. There is a 1/4"" gap between the door and the pet door. Would love Perfect Pet to access this concern."
5,Tubby cat door,This is a great cat door. The door is easy to install. The locks work good too. The larger size makes it easier for the fat cats.
3,"Nice door, but often blows open","I bought this for my 18# cat that no longer fits through his normal ""cat door."" The cat had to learn to go through it slowly so it wouldn't slam on his tail, but he learned. My biggest problem with this door is that the magnet catch is not strong enough to keep the wind from opening it and letting the breeze in my house."
2,my cat hated it,"she found it very disconcerting so I took it out and left the hole in the door. Not very elegant, but the cat needs to use the litter box, so there it is.That said, it seemed reasonably well made."
5,Excellent,"Truly excellent in every way. A great value.My wife wanted a carving knife even though we wouldn't use it more than a few times a year. That made the case important for us. It won't be in the knife block, it will be tucked away waiting for an occasion that requires a large bit of meat.The quality of the knife is what you'd expect from Wustoff's high end and the fork is doubly so. The fork alone would normally cost this much (subtracting for the case). If you want a carving set I can't imagine finding a better value than this."
1,"No information about size, it may be just anything","Wüsthof Classic 2-Piece Carving Set in Presentation Box - but there is no information about size of item, therefore it's just useless for me.BTW, where is a button to post it ?"
4,Short But Sweet,"This is a book about a skunk who befriends a tramp. I thought it was a sweet book, and the length was satisfactory. The author is award-winning (in fact, he has won awards for other books). If you like animal stories, or dislike long books, then I would recomend this book."
2,Won't Buy This Kind Again,"I bought this DVD as it had my 3 favorite Christmas movies on it. But when we played it, it had a high pitch hum during every movie. We checked our DVD player by playing other movies, and they all played fine. So I had to turn around and buy each of those movies individually. I won't be buying any more DVD's like this one again."
4,A good purchase times 3 except,"This was a great price for three Christmas movies.1) learning that Christmas can and maybe should be simple (I don't like it when someone says that was a good movie, but... so this is a good movie. I especially liked the character of Uncle Ralph, but for my family of boys I did not think it was necessary to have the shower scene with the bare back and implication of her being nude. Just my opinion.2) family and friends are treasures to take good care of3) look on the inside of people and not what your eyes are seeing"
5,Get the hot chocolate and cookies ready to settle in and watch tv.,This is a great lineup of programs that start out great and end on a truly happy note. Henry Winkler is absolutely wonderful in this program. I keep coming back to it at the end of my busy holidays just so that I can relax and feel good.
5,I used it to glue my crown back in,Had one of my tooth crowns falls off while in the shop and figured I'd give it a try.Didn't want to use the red or blue Loctite because I figured the dentist would have a hard time removing the crown.Well I never made it to the dentist and this product has been holding my tooth on just fine.No bad taste either.
2,pilates dvd,too much ads and not enough to the point needed to spend 10 minutes to reach a working level
3,Not very challenging,"I was a bit disappointed with Hit the Spot Pilates. The ability to mix & match 3 levels is nice, although the first one doesn't present a challenge at all. I skip it now; levels 2 and 3 get progressively more difficult but are still not to the level that I was expecting (and I'm by no means an expert at pilates).The add-on features are a nice supplement but again, do not make me feel like I've gotten a good workout."
3,Harder than I thought,"Maybe I'm just really out of shape, but the exercises aren't as easy as I thought they'd be. I'd tried her dance workout and found it too fast pace, I kept blowing past my target heartrate after a matter of minutes. So I thought pilates would be easier on me, but it's really not.Maybe that's just me. I haven't tried it since the first time, cause muscles I didn't know I had were sore for 3 days, but I plan on trying it again sometime. Eventually."
2,"Talks waaaaay to much, so annoying!","I got this DVD because I really like DVDs that have lots of short segments you can mix and match. I usually get 10 minute solution DVDs which I love. This one sounded similar so I thought I'd try it.I tried it once and it's unlikely I will use this DVD again. Denise Austin is soooo annoying! She talks NON STOP, and uses the most sickening cutesy terms. Also she only does maybe four reps at most of most of the excercises so it doesn't seem very effective. I didn't feel anything the next day at all. The excercises themselves did not challenge my body at all, however they still seemed way too complicated. I also didn't like the way a lot of the moves were quite 'dancey'. This DVD is ok for beginners, as long as you can stand the constant annoying talking of Denise. Personally, if I never hear the words 'zip up your abs!' again, I will be happy. I'm going back to 10 minute solution."
3,It's... ok,"It's good but not amazing. If you have done pilates before, it doens't give you a huge challenge. It's not terrible, it's just... ok."
4,I'm sore!,This was a great video. I've been sore for 2 days after 20 minutes of workout in the exact spots that the video claimed to be working on! Hurray!
2,Needs work,"I like Denise Austin and have many of her videos and DVD's with regards to strength training, fat busting and cardio work but she needs to stay away from Yoga/Pilates. She goes too fast and misses the idea that this type of exercise program is a slow, easy, relaxing method that allows one to work out and yes break a sweat but isn't done in a rah,rah style that Denise Austin is known for. As I said I am a great fan of hers for that but she needs to leave the Pilates and Yoga items to someone else."
4,it hits the spot!!,"Pilates can be challenging but its one of the excercise routines I can say I truly, truly enjoy! I started with this tape to get the feel for pilates and then I bought winsor pilates tapes to alternate with. What's great about this tape is their is a fifteen minute floor segment at the end that I do when I am not really feeling up to excercising but need something to get me going for the day! The best part of pilates NO shoes are required!!!! Never knew I could be so flexible!! Great tape to tap into the world of pilates."
3,HMMM,"My opinion on this dvd based on my experience, is I don't think that Denise Austin is a good instructor at least on this particular workout. It seemed as if she was thinking of things to do as she went along. Her cues were off, she would move on to another position without saying so or she would say last one and it wasn't the last. If you take your eyes off the television you will be lost because her direction was less than impressive. I love pilates which is why I ordered this workout, but If you are new to pilates you might not want to start with this. The workout is affective though if you do it and stick with it you will see results. She knows what she is doing her body is incredible I just have issues with her instructions."
2,Very confusing to follow!,I ordered this DVD along with another pilates dvd by Brooke Siler. I did not enjoy the way Denise Austin instructs and teaches the exercises. I felt she moved too fast and some of the exercises were not very safe for someone who has had a history of back issues. She goes too fast. After two years I just do not use this DVD. I do not recommend this one.
4,Good DVD,"Have to say - this is a good DVD. It is my second DVD that I have purchased on Pilates and this is by far a better work out thean the other one I have. The exercises are clear and quick moving. You can really feel the 'burn'! There is a good selection of different exercises and I have to say that, most importantly of all, I feel it is working. Denise Austin herself can be a touch painful to listen to over and over again but there are options where you can mute her! So, presumably she realises that she sounds painful herself! Overall, I would really recommend this DVD to anyone wishing to pursue Pilates at home on their own schedule. I wouldn't say that this is a DVD for absolute beginners since some of the exercises are quite tough and since it is fast moving it may be hard to really get the benefit if you are the whole time trying to work out which leg goes where."
2,"Denise Austin ""Hit the Spot"" - Pilates","I usually like her stuff, but I don't think for a beginner her pilates is the best choice. She does the moves too fast and doesn't really talk about your breathing or form. This is NOT for beginners."
4,"Not a Purist's Practice, but Still Good","I admit that I am something of a Pilates snob - I'll choose one of Rael Isacowitz's Pilates workouts over just about any others. But when I put away my snooty hat and get down to the basics, I have to say that this DVD from Denise Austin actually offers up a pretty good light toning workout. And the programmable functions on the DVD are great for someone like me, who mixes and matches segments like crazy. Denise is no Rael or Moira Stott, but if you're already familiar with Pilates form, you'll get by fine without precise instruction on all the moves. And yes, I know Pilates is about conditioning the whole body, and spot toning is really the antithesis of true Pilates. So when I do this DVD, I mentally tape over the ""Pilates"" part of the title and just consider it a ""hit the spot"" workout. In that way, it does the job quite well."
5,Good Workout,I really like this DVD because you can customize your workout. There are 6 segments focusing on different areas and you can program the workout to add which segments you want to do. The exercises themselves are challenging but not too hard that you won't want to do them.
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,I never received this product and has not received any restitution for mypurchase!
1,Motivating instructor 4* not 1,"I've been doing Denise Austin workouts since I was a teenager and had a video of her from the 80s which I played to death. Her exercises are fantastic & are helping me get into shape after having a baby (I'm now 30 so she still looks pretty good for her age!). Only problem with this DVD is it assumes you wont want to do all the segments. I wanted to work 30 mins on my stomach to flatten it post pregnancy + hips, thighs, bum & cardio challenge. Every time I do the workout I have to select all 7 segments as there's no option to PLAY ALL. I still like her style as she's very encouraging & challenges you to go further each time so you can watch it over again and not get irritated like with some other instructors. 'Loose an inch!' However, I would like a more advanced workout from her as after 3 months I'm finding it easy."
4,EASY TO FOLLOW,This an easy to follow Pilates that is great for beginners and intermediate alike. Denise takes you through basics that really target problems areas. I was amazed that my tummy muscles had such a workout. It didn't feel like a workout at all. It was fun!
3,Not for beginners,As an advid pilates person I thought that this was going to be a good mix up from my usual routine however she worked my butt off.
3,No stretching and work outs are not fluid,I have 3 of Denise Austin's Pilate's DVD's this one is my least favorite. The main reason I dislike it is there is no stretch segment or stretching in the beginning of each work out. I guess if you don't mind stretching on your own before you do the work out it would be okay. The other reason I disliked it was that the movements aren't always fluid moving from one smoothly to the next. Other then that there are some good moves and the DVDs are okay. The Denise Austin video I prefer the most is the Daily Dozen it has a 12 stretching segment (I like to do everyday) and then 2 body sculpting segments with handweights and 2 cardio workouts. I really like the body sculpting and have seen results from it!
4,Hit the Spot - Pilates,"Denise Austin is a great teacher and explains all the moves thoroughly. She makes it easy to follow along, and has the DVD broken into highlighting different parts of the body. The DVD also has different levels, so if you're a beginner, you can start at an easy level and work your way up to the more difficult levels."
5,perfect for me!,"I love that I can choose the workout right for me. They are quick and make you feel great. I have many workout DVD's, but this one is the best by far."
4,Awesome ab workout! Actually works.,"I am 22 and tend to poke fun at exericse videos, but I would HIGHLY suggest this product to anyone who wants to flatten their stomach and get good abs. I saw results in a week, which I did not expect from a random exercise video. The ""Power Abs"" is pretty difficult and had me sweating, while the Abs & Waistline Segment was also challenging. They are 10 minute segments, and doing these 2 segments together several times a week whipped me back into bikini shape quickly. MUCH more effective than crunches. There are other segments for the lower body, but the abs section seemed the best to me. BUY THIS FOR THE AB WORKOUT! Seriously."
5,Great toning dvd!,"i've always been a hard-core fitness person (cycling, sports and the like), and this was one of my first workout videos to purchase. at first i thought it was cheesy. however, i found that denise makes me laugh and the workout is awesome. i always do 3 workouts back to back and i am sweating by the end. definitely recommend it."
4,Be familiar with pilates,"This was a good workout. But you definitely need to be familiar with Pilates before you start this. She goes a bit fast, but go at your own pace, but try to keep up and really push yourself. You will definitely bee feeling this workout the next day. You can customize or just play the individual workouts if you just have 10 minutes. And 10 minutes does not go by fast, so you will get a workout. Denise is a little too peppy for me, but better peppy than sore."
5,Jackie Chan really kicks but!,"Jackie Chan is a kung-fu master, he kicks but .this game is so good I am speechless..."
4,JACKIE IS AWESOME IN THIS GAME!!!,"This game is very awesome I would recommend it to any Jackie chan fans. If you like his movies, or even his show Jackie chan adventures on kids wb you need this game. There are ten levels of intense action, almost anything in the game can be throw, or used to fight with. The grafics are great really giving true meaning to the show. So if your a Jackie fan, or you just want a good fighting game for GBA get Jackie Chan adventures today. Believe me I really think you will love this game. Have fun!!!"
3,"Decent, but with some issues","I got this game really cheap, but the reviews were good. I used to like the cartoon so I figured what the heck.Pro:-Good collection of moves.-Fun game play.-Enjoyable overall.-Weapons are handy.Cons:-Controls are sloppy when trying to break objects for power-ups.-Weapons break too easily.-Jackie jumps like he's spring-loaded, frequently off the screen to his death.Even though this is based on a TV show, which is often a kiss of death, for a cheap GBA Double Dragon clone, you can't go wrong with this game."
5,This video game is really good,"This game is very similiar to Double Dragon from the ancient days of yore, but with Jackie Chan instead. In other words it is really addictive to play and loads of fun. Heck lots of times while I was playing it I would say to myself, ""I'm going to quit now."" However then I would keep right on playing the darn thing. It's just plain fun that's all I can say."
4,sottotono: an italian miracle,"Sottotono is a group that launched the italian way to hip hop. They made this great album with great tracks like TRANQUILLO, DIMMI DI SBAGLIATO CHE C'E, SOLO LEI HA QUEL CHE VOGLIO. This disc is full of west coast influences (dr.dre, george clinton,...) mixed with one of the dopest european mc's: Tormento, who lead every track with a mature and unique flow.After the success of this album they launched a label which is deeply involved in the complexity of iyìtalian rap scene:it's the Area cronica and you can find information about his artists at the index: areacronica.com"
1,The ice deafener,"Thie ice crusher is so loud we have to let the dogs out of the house before we use it. When done crushing, the hood drips water on the counter for an hour. I don't like it at all, but it crushes the ice to the perfect size for martinis so we use it."
3,TRICKY IF YOU NEED A LOT OF ICE,I FIND THAT BY ADDING MORE THAN 1 CUBE AT A TIME CAUSES THE BLADES TO JAM.IN WHICH CASE YOU HAVE TO REMOVE THE OTHER THROUGH A SMALL OPENING
3,It works well but wear ear protection,This crusher does work well but is a bit noisier than i would like.... still reccommend
2,Ice Crusher - Broke,This ice crusher really worked well until the cutter that is riveted to the plastic broke off. The cutter fell into the ice but we thought we could still use the ice. We continued making our drinks but then realized that part of the plastic from the ice crusher was in there.
2,"It is OK, but","I had a similar problem as an other reviewer stated. The revits came out of the blade in the front housing after about a year or so of use. It is noisy and messy, but it does chop up the ice!Not sure I will get another may look into the blender (ice crusher) approach."
4,Makes nice crushed ice quickly,"This machine does a good job of crusing ice into perfect size for drinks.It is no longer available for sale but I found one at a second-hand store for less than a couple of dollars. Works perfectly. It is noisy, but your crushing ice into a plastic bin, thats going to make noise. It does make a small puddle of water. All of this should be expected.Blenders just dont do a good job of crushing ice and your eventually going to burn out the motor. If you can find this model at a good price, I would buy it. Expect to do one cube at a time. Eventually you may expect an ice crusher to wear out. Crushing hard ice is difficult on a machine. I am very happy with what I have and would recommend it, Does a good job."
1,Misleading and not true to form!,"Mats arrived and were not even close to what was pictured in the ad. To top it off they did not fit my vehicle, but had groves that I could trim to supposedly help them get closer to fitting. I expected a lot more from this company."
3,Not for my Vehicle !,These mats are NOT designed for specific vehicles. There is no shape or uniqueness to the mats. I think these same mats would probably fit 75% of all cars and trucks produced. The are Heavy duty but for the money I expected more of a customized fit
3,Not The Original Recordings,"I have two of David's albums from the '70s and was quite happy to see that my favorites of his were now available on CD. But there are no original recordings on this album, just re-recordings done in the Philippines. The quality is quite good, but I've never heard a re-recording that outdid the original, and although these come close, I only gave it three stars because the magic of the originals is absent."
2,Not Better Rendition than the original,"I really liked the songs in the album. However, all of them are re-recording and does not match the magic the original recording brings."
4,Dark and disturbing - with a bit of joy and music,This novel is a disturbing study of a family in debt to a man who takes advantage of that debt is ways which degrade the debtor. There are glimmers of hope as the debtors earn money playing the fiddle for dances in the neighborhood - but even that positive note is destroyed.This is a well plotted novel - worth reading but definately for those who enjoy a dark novel.
5,Wonderful!,"With two 16 year old cats, the smell of cat urine is a constant in my home. I've tried tons of products with no luck, so I thought I may as well give this one a shot. Honestly, I was pessimistic, but after a few sprays of Pee Be Gone, the smell really is gone. I just finished the bottle and I'm back to buy more. :)"
2,Disappointed,I was expecting a listing by movies not by stars.Who remembers all the stars first.List the movies and then the stars that were in the movies plus the minor stars also.Disappointed in the book.
4,some problems but good overall,"I actually like the why this book was set up;alphabetically listing 500 names from cinema history,and providing short and pithy biographies and nice photos for each person.But there are a few problems.One egregious one is that the picture of Gong Li,actaully isn`t Gong Li(It is a picture of Gong Li`s servant girl in the movie Raise the Red Lantern.Also are are some names that should have been in here,and some that probably shouldn`t be in here.Three ""major"" names that were ommitted from this book were ""Fredrich March""( two time Academy award winner for best actor ),""William Holden ""(star of Sunset Boulevard,The Bridge on the River Kwi,the Wild Bunch,Network,Stalag 17,and many others.Also I believe he is the only actor to win an acedemy award and an emmy.And lastly ""John Barrymore"",who started of an a great stage actor and became,as any good movie historian will tell you,one of the greats of early cinema."
2,"To Be a Snap Circuit, This One is JUNK","I have purchased other Snap Circuit products for my Grandson and all have worked as advertised. This Motion Detector does not work as advertised, even in the instructions it says ""if it won't shut up replace the battery"". The battery is not the problem, tried 2 brand new batteries and never could get the the thing to STOP alarming.Don't waste your money on this one for the motion detector, although the other little noise maker circuits are cute."
4,He liked it..,"Our 9 year old son really enjoyed this toy. It does not come with explanations as to why it works, ideally the parent would help with this understanding and we explained it to him and he was enthralled with it for about a day. After that it was kinda like any other toy, he had built it and moved on. I plan to purchase an additional set to make this a bit more exciting, but a good starter to gauge if your child will enjoy this type of toy."
3,It's OK,"I would recommend getting the full kit instead of this ""project"" oriented kits. Once the few projects have been completed, it's not much fun. The larger kit is a better deal and much more fun. Seller shipped on time and I received the product in good condition."
2,Poor response to concern,The toy worked for about an hour and then the power source burned out and the motion detector was no longer usable. I was told by Amazon that a new power source would be sent to me by the company and that did not happen. So I would like my account credited for the cost of this item.
2,Not a quick reference,"I bought this looking for a quick reference guide. 128 pages of microscopic text is *not* conducive to finding info in an emergency. If you want a quick reference guide, buy the FastAct Pocket First Aid Guide. This tries to be in-depth but can only do so much even in type this tiny; if you want an in-depth guide, buy theThe American Red Cross First Aid and Safety Handbook. Whatever you want, this isn't it."
1,Revisionism cloaked as History for Children,"Milton Meltzer is clearly out to rewrite history. He's eager to point out every petty flaw of King David and Charlemagne, but makes the bloodthirsty Atahualpa and Kublai Khan look like modern egalitarian leaders. Capitalism and self-determination are clearly bad things, but totalitarianism and forced labor come off as benign. Hammurabi is described as a ""benign despot"", and we are told that slaves in ancient Babylonia were not treated as harshly as ""slaves in the Americas"".I'm not sure what Meltzer is trying to accomplish, but make sure you read this with your child with open and questioning eyes."
2,"Technically good, artisticaly lacking","Considering the amazing scenery in Colorado this book is a disappointment. (...)Many great, hard to get to locations get missed. The shots are technically very good but lack any creativity, these are standard ""stand by the track, click the shutter"" type shots. Photo reproduction is excellent."
2,Disappointed,"I am disappointed that the Rival 3745SC that was listed as nearly brand new and only used once or twice, however it has a big dent in the side so that the handle is loose. I also expected a book to go along with it. I guess that's what you get when you buy used. Next time I will buy new. It also took a very long time to arrive even though it was shipped FedEx."
3,Watch out for the exterior,"We got this as a wedding gift after I had registered for it, it was considerably more expensive then. I didn't have inordinate problems with liquid evaporation, but the stainless steel exterior does get hot enough to cook on itself. I don't have kids so I didn't have a problem keeping this, but do be aware of it. Between the exterior and the lid you need to wear a hot glove when you handle anything in the cooker. Other than that it was fine. One advantage to this cooker is that you can make a lot of food or a little, and you can even cook a whole chicken in it, which you couldn't do with the old round cookers. ..."
4,"Nice, but hot","This crock pot has met all of my expectations. This is my first crock pot with a removable crock. VERY nice (1) to remove for washing, and (2) to prepare a meal the night before, put in the fridge, and then put in the holder in the morning & plug in. My only negative comment on this item is outside gets very hot. You could easily burn yourself by touching the metal part (not the handles). I knew this before I bought it, as I had read the other reviews. As long as you're expecting the hot outside, you won't be disappointed in the crock pot."
1,Disappointed,"I was truly disappointed when I received my slow cooker. The lid did not fit, therefore it can not be used."
2,Crock of ...,"I've owned this Crockpot for approximately two years now. I've only used it maybe 5 times. From the time I got it, it's always gotten /extremely/ hot on the sides, hot enough to cause a burn. Fair enough, I'd just be careful with it.Well today, on use #6, it blew out my electrical outlet. I moved it to another outlet, and it threw sparks when I plugged it in. Although it worked OK, when someone moved it, it threw sparks out the back. ..."
4,"beautiful and intricate, but....","Most of this coloring book is as wonderful as I expected it to be. I like the selections from the Book of Kells that were chosen to be included, and there's a good variety. The subject matter can't be beat, but I have two small complaints. One, some of the smaller knotwork details are indistinct, even missing. I realize they may be missing in the original, but for a coloring book I really feel they should have been extrapolated for completeness' sake. Second, the Latin script pages aren't translated, and the old calligraphy is hard enough to read that I can't translate them myself.Aside from these picky details, though, this is a gorgeous, fun coloring book, perfectly appropriate for the collector, either of coloring books or Celtophilia:)"
2,Does not work as a coloring book,"I just received this and am rather disappointed. The lines are so tiny indistinct and spaces so tiny that it will not really function as a coloring book. I will probably buy fine-tipped colored pens for this, because I don't think anything else will work (and those may bleed... still not sure how to use this). I also got Sibbett's Celtic Design Coloring Book, which is much bolder and well-defined. It was what I had in mind when I ordered this one. I recommend that over this one."
5,Brings The Canyon Country To Life,I am a big fan of Ann Zwinger and of the Four Corners region. This book recreates the experience of walking through the canyons of southeastern Utah showing that despite surface similarities--each is unique and special. The book is enriched with her drawings of flowers and animals.
5,I love this book!,"I love Laura Whipple's vibrant retelling of the Cinderella story. It's fresh, new and full of ryhthmic enchantment from the cat (""cat is master; cat is cat"") to the glass slipper pining for its mate, to the wary rat who becomes a coachman (""where were my whiskers, a-twitching, a-tremble?"") The book begs to be read aloud - even sung - alone or in a group. The ending, in which Cinderella addresses her audience, brought tears to my eyes. It told me, ""This is not only Cinderella's story, it is yours."" Laura Beingessner's accompanying illustrations are as full of magic as the text. All in all, this book is a winner."
4,Tight techno,"I don't listen to too much techno, but this osng is tight. The beat is dope. Check this out!"
5,"Buy ""Castles in the Sky""!","Ian Van Dahl has a smash-hit dance track here! If you don't have this yet, then what the heck are you waiting for? It just doesn't get any better than this. This single is well worth whatever it may cost you. The ""Peter Luts Remix"" is the standout that lasts over 7 minutes. Trax 4&5 are instrumental, and would be cool to add some lyrics over. The ""De Donatis Remix""(Track 6)includes cool robotic-vocoder vocals along with Marsha's echoed vocals, and also runs over 7 minutes. Truly awesome! Marsha sounds like she came from a Castle in the Sky because her voice is heavenly. Last, but not least is the ""Wippenberg Remix"" that sounds like ATC's ""Around The World"". Also, if you are from my area check-out DJ Acid's CD ""Phiya"" which features the ""D-Eternal Remix""(which is also outstanding) of this song. If you liked my review, then don't forget to vote. THANKS!"
5,Good book for working SQL peeps,"Great book. I gotta say, he breaks things down so that they make sense, and covers the stuff you'll actually need to be concerned with in day-to-day SQL situations."
3,quite ok,"I have heard a lot of things about this series and really wanted to see it. it was also very hard to get hat to wait about 3 weeks for amazon to deliver it even though they promissed to do it a lot faster. about the series: it is a nice and interesting topic, however the action moves a bit slow. Still I would recommend it to people who like historical drama."
3,my wife made me watch this,"prunes & prejudice, green of ann gables, romy & michelles high school reunion... i've seen them all... including this one. i guess it's only fair since i drag her to see movies like star wars... guys, this soap opera is long but tolerable... if you are a decent person who cares for things like honor and virtue, then this show might tickle your fancy... i just wish they had more tai kwon do and less scenes of people sighing, emoting, and casting meaningful but silent glances at one another..."
5,The best burger you'll ever make indoors,"It's cast iron, so you can run this pan as hot as you dare to sear the flavor in. Makes excellent burgers, with nice grill marks but no burned spots, even done all the way through. Try that with a George Foreman and your burger will be black outside and dryer than the Mojave Desert inside.The square pan provides plenty of room to fry up a few burgers and the hot juices in the bottom are made-to-order for sauteeing a few mushrooms, onions, or peppers to go on top. The handle is fatter than older Lodge designs and quite ergonomic as long as you're wearing an oven mitt. Cleans nicely by boiling a little water in the pan and giving it a quick scrub with a stiff round natural-bristle vegetable brush.ONE MINOR DETAIL - I own the pre-seasoned Lodge Logic version of this pan, which is not currently offered by Amazon. You'll have to season this pan yourself, and I can't vouch for whether it will work as well as the pre-seasoned version."
5,Great grill simulation,Received my cast iron grill pan and used it right away on my steak. It was great!... I seared the steak first then put the them in the oven . It tasted like it really came out of my outdoor grill. This will be great especially on times when my husband will not want to barbeque outdoor.
2,"A fine pan, but lid unavailable","The space-efficient square shape allows you to grill more food at one time than you would with a round pan. Cast iron, although heavy, is a perfect material for grilling, and this pan is good. Grilling is usually done with high heat; after all, you want to simulate outdoor cooking. You think that since you want to grill and not steam, a lid might not be necessary. But I have found that I want a lid sometimes - if only to use for thirty seconds. For that simple reason I would advise anyone interested in grilling to buy a pan that comes with a lid."
3,Good but Could be Better,The grill pan is wonderful except it needs a lid to keep in the flavor and to speed up the cooking process. My husband accidentally put the grill pan in the dishwasher and when I removed it; it had rust all over it. I had to throw it out. Never make this mistake!
3,For an old Playstation game.......still very fun!,"Spider-Man 2: Enter ElectroI ordered this game for my 9 year old son. I don't know why he insists on me buying and him playing old Playstation games but he enjoys playing them thoroughly. Spiderman 2 is an excellent, clean, fun Spiderman game."
4,Spiderman 2,I think it is pretty good and I hope you make a third one but I think Venom and Carnage should be in here and maybe for a cheatcode you can get to play them AND THEIR POWERS!
4,Thank goodness for this.,"Ahhhhh... The original was a easy, short, ugly and boring game. This is better. And if you want to unlock everything,All Costumes and powersAll SnapshotsAll Movies and StoryboardsAll LevelsAll everything.Just type AUNTMAY and Voilá.But where is the fun in that?The fun is:All Costumes and powersAll SnapshotsAll Movies and StoryboardsAll LevelsAll everything.So, just buy it now!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Good,but not good enough","The first game was more than great. The only problem was that it was too short, it was only few days when I played it through. Enter Electro got the same problem, it's too short. Firs game gave great super opponents, but this time it's little colorless. I mean the Sandman did great, but Electro isn't charismatic enough to be the main villain. The best battles where against The Shocker and Sandman. One great new thing was that you can stand on the roof,look down on the street, see the nameless thug, jump down and knock him off or use your web. Spider sense was also one great new thing, but it should warn you even only thug is aiming you by his gun or notice your apperance. Spider sense is the most important thing what makes spider-man so amazing. I hope the part 3 will have these kind of details. And if possible DONT PUT GREEN GOBLIN IN THERE!I hate that guy. The Hog Goblin, Hydroman, Tarantula, Kraven or Vulture could work."
2,NOT WORTH IT,"Spider-man 1 was ok, but their sequal was a SHIP WRECK. All the ""thugs"" say is ""your web-swinging days are over"" or""goodbye good-doer"" which isn't even a word! This makes you turn the sounds off, and their are no subtitles to find out what you really need. Plus, all the bad guys use the same attacks, so one strategie wins the game. Plus, it did not exsplain what was left un-exsplained in the first game. That's what a makes a sequal good! Playing it waskind of fun, but it got boooooring! I guess you could rent it....but don't buy it! It is not worth all that money!"
1,Horrible Game,"This is the worst game ever. When I rented it I took it back early. I thought this game would be great............was I ever wrong! The main reason it's bad is that it is so hard it takes all the fun away!!!!! The first boss is ok, but the second is as hard as a super-boss. I can barely get through some of the levels.All in all, it is a game that is not worth the money to buy or rent it."
2,Don't Buy It !!!!!!!!!!,"Do yourself a favor, don't buy this game.I'am a HUGE Spidey fan and ran out to getthe game as soon as it was out, BIG MISTAKE !!!!!!Hands down the 1st Spider-Man game is 100 timesbetter than this piece of junk.The graphics were slightly better than the first.Overall the whole story was very lame,gameplay was very difficult and i havent playedit a second time. I feel more effort went into theStan Lee narrations rather than the gameplay itself."
4,A VERY GOOD GAME!,"Spider man1 was a bomb.But this one is even Better.It has a good story line but there are some cons and prosPROS:1)Good graphics2)easy controls3)Loads of different costumesCONS:1)Faulty camera angles2)The games too shortAnd does any one want a handy cheat .WELL!!!go to the cheats menu and write ""AUNT MAY""this cheat will unlock EVERYTHING.all costumes all levels and whatever.WELL then Happy Gaming!Control:4.5Graphics:5Gameplay:5Value:4Over all :Actually I,ll give it a 4.5"
5,Elua Kane,This CD is really for an Elua Kane fan or for those who just want to relax without ever being to Hawaii. I had an opportunity to go the Islands and these artists capture the spirit from inside looking out. Their voices carry an undeniablelove for who they are and where they are from. Imagine going to a shrink and not paying the price. I would also recommend their previous CD Ukelele Boy.
4,Soda Pop Girls are a big hit with little girls,"Our 4.5 year old loves the Soda Pop girl dolls. Each one comes with several cute accessories, clothing, and a pet. They are much cuter than the Bratz dolls and a perfect size for small hands. Definitely fun for preschool girls."
3,Less for more,"I was happy to see that these filters are once again available. They are really nice for my Braun coffee maker because the water where I live is so hard. I bought this one and it came today. I thought it was the 2-pack, which is what I've always seen, but this price is for ONE filter. If you want the 2 pack, then go here: http://www.amazon.com/Braun-Brita-Patented-Filter-2-Pack/dp/B000062UH2/ref=pd_bxgy_k_text_b"
4,Water filter,The water filter is inexpensive and pretty good.. Serves the purpose and light on your pocket...
3,Water Filter Review,"I have no idea whether or not this gizmo cleans the water for our coffee, but I buy it anyway. It is a little expensive if you change the filter often, but I don't."
5,Filter works great...cofee maker bites,"The concept is terrific, great coffee, no need to have external water filters. The problem is with the Bruan Coffe maker. It is constantly overflowing, the auto-shut-off is not dependable and it is prone to calification(sp). I have never had that problem before. My Braun thermal carafe lasted five months before the overlaoded fliters/spilling out and steam dispersing up my wall and onto the counter top.Filter great!Machine horrible."
2,meh,"It was expensive & got little playtime & love after the novelty of the tags wore off! My daughter was just as happy to play w/ the tag on her teddy bear! I found that the cups are not easy for little ones to stack or nest either. While the taggies products are great in concept , if I had it to do over I would pick another one. This one just sits in the corner unloved ..waste of $My daughter plays w/ the $3.00 plastic nesting cups all of the time ..I'd get those instead if I were you!"
2,Waste of money,Can't stand this toy. My son takes the center ball out and throws it. That is as much action as this toy has seen. It's been in the toy box since we got it 6 months ago. It's adorable but he just doesn't care about it. The fabric the toy is made out of makes me cringe. I have eczema on my hands so I am sensitive to fabrics. This toy's fabric is rough and clings to my skin like velcro. I can't touch it anymore. It's very cheap stuff. The quality of construction is great it's just the fabric that sucks. The little windows that line up and make animals are really cute. I'm sure it would be educational if my son liked it but he's totally in to cars and crashing things together instead of nesting cups and lining up animal faces.
4,What's Gone Can Always Be Replaced,"Review: First their reputation: Moist a heavy rock outfit from Canada combine strong use of guitars and introspective religious based lyrics. Enter Mercedes Five And Dime a departure from the group's louder previous works. Gone is the thunderous rock sounds replaced by a mellower low key (almost pop like) movement. While the lyrics remain focused on spiritual topics, from God to guilt to death, the group's energy is expended exploring new sonic territories. Clearly more comfortable in the studio they are willing to take more chances and experiment sonically. Prominent experiments include heavy uses of synthesizers, loops, and hooks. Sometimes the experiments are effective as on Underground or Fish. Other times they leave the listener wanting as on Mike Hammer. On the whole Moist's new sound is pleasing but different. Mercedes Five and Dime may create a wider appeal for the band but new fans will be shocked to discover Moist's previous rockier noisier recordings."
2,pleasantly bland,"I've been interested in hearing these guys for a while, as I really enjoyed Little Songs, the album Moist singer David Usher released a year or so ago. I must say I'm disappointed. It's just another widescreen, ""alternative"" rock album that sounds like it was made to get on the radio, rather than for emotional or artistic expression. It's extremely well-crafted but boring.However, if you're a fan of bands like Matchbox 20 and whoever it is that sings that annoying ""Whatever Makes You Happy"" song, you'll probably eat this up."
5,Just Like John,"He's rough. He's tough. He's pleasantly intimidating to anyone wishing a confrontation. Big John is coming.""Stagecoach"" may have made him a star but this one personified the walk, the talk, and the legend.Finally, on DVD, restored beautifully in mint black and white with sound to match.This is Mr. Wayne in his prime with a terrific supporting cast. Gabby Hayes and Raymond Hatton, the original oldtimers and sidekicks are hilarious. Paul Fix, veteran actor best known from ""The Rifleman"", as the roustabout bad guy. Ward Bond in one of many appearances in Wayne films. The lovely Ella Raines who fits her tomboy role like a glove. And after 50 years it holds up. No question about it.If you're a John Wayne fan this is a must see.The really great thing about this film is that Wayne, while whipping the bad guys and getting the girl, never shoots his gun. It's all in the ""strut and stare"".Magnificent."
3,Fun Movie,"I'm not a connoisseur of Westerns, but I've seen quite a few, including the artful and hallowed ones, such as Broken Arrow, The Searchers, High Noon, Shane, etc. Tall in the Saddle is light fare, with a lot of snappy banter and winks at the audience. My dad (in his 90s) was watching this and I sat down for a few minutes but watched it to the end. A good flick's a good flick!"
4,Good western - but not a John Wayne classic,"Tall in the Saddle is a good Western starring John Wayne that is well worth watching. If you like John Wayne's early Westerns, then you will enjoy this one as well. The plot is interesting, although a little hard to follow at times (not sure I ever figured out why Wayne's character does not like women), but it moves along at a nice pace. The cast is solid, and includes some of the usual suspects found in several of Wayne's movies. Overall, I enjoyed the film, and am glad I watched it, but I would not rank it up with some of his other classics like Rio Bravo, or Red River."
5,A Thrilling Western!,"Imagine getting a Western flick that has a thrilling subplot, a mystery that continues to the very end, and causes you to feel like you need to watch it again and again and again! That's what TALL IN THE SADDLE is all about: it leaves you wanting more and more of it!!! Don't cheat yourself by ignoring this great Western; it's an old classic, and one of the best ever written!! John Wayne is at his best, and two beautiful women vie for his attention, along with some underhanded ways of other town's folk. You won't believe how good this Western is, until you buy it!!!!It makes you want to be a cowboy!Satisfaction Guaranteed"
5,Great Trilogy,"I was really happy to stumble across this series. I found it on my Kindle and downloaded a sample chapter for free to get started. I was completely hooked, and for the last two weeks I've plowed through the whole trilogy in my evenings and weekends.This book was complex enough that you have to have some brains to figure out what's going on and keep track of the characters, and enjoyable enough that you don't need to keep crib notes to remember arcane details that detract from having fun. The summary is available above and quite clear. There are swords, there are swordsmen, there are wizards and sorcerers. There is fighting, there is some romance, there is a lot of adventure, and even some mysteries that need to be unlocked.Just a great adventure, great series, and great read. I think in total for the Kindle this entire series was under ten dollars, and when you consider the amount of fun I had reading it, there's no better deal out there."
4,Loved it,"Strong bending to the series.Dave Duncan finished the series strongly, and etched out a beautiful ending to the saga,"
2,Enjoyable writing but poor story,"I enjoyed reading this series (hence, the additional star) even though the protagonist never accomplished much on his own. When I got to the end, I discovered that he never would. In fact, the whole thing was always essentially out of his hands. OK, he had one accomplishment, but it wasn't exactly the type of accomplishment I like to see from a ""hero"". The series left me dissatisfied and annoyed by the naive political subtext."
2,this sucks!!!!!!!!1,i got this game for x-mas and i thought it would be the coolest game in the world but:1)bad graphics2)limited tricks3)limited players4)!!!!!!!!!!
1,THIS IS THE WORST GAME I HAVE EVER SEEN,This game is so bad that you can not geet to the next level you fall a lot it is hard to contral and there is no point of this game .
5,Overdue & Presumed Lost: The Story Of The USS Bullhead,"My older brother was one of the 84 officers & crew lost on the Bullhead. I had been searching for some information about him for a long time because I was only 11 years old when WWII ended. He was 12 years older than I and joined the navy, as did our father in WWI, when he was just a youngster of 19. He had a son, my nephew, whom he saw only once or twice. The Bullhead was the last US Naval vessel lost during the war. It went down in the Java Sea in early August of '45 only weeks before the Japanese surrender in September. I never knew what my brother did on the boat. He was the baker and is mentioned in two or three paragraphs on page 40 of the book. It has given me a sense of closure because I never knew what happened or when my brother lost his life in service to our country. I'm glad I found the book and can recommend it to anyone interested in naval history."
3,A fitting memorial,"My uncle, Harry A. McDermott, MoMM3, was one of the sailors onboard when the USS Bullhead was lost."
5,Simply wonderful,"My three year old daughter has been in love with Little Bear for over a year now. She rarely tires of watching this show, and she absolutely loves the books. The characters are highly appealing and varied, and Little Bear's adventures are imaginative and very fun."
4,Sebago Loafer Shoes,I have always rated Sebago shoes and I am certainly not disappointed with my recent purchase. However I was a little perturbed to see that they were unlined which seems like an unfortunate cost cutting measure. The leather is very stiff which will require some breaking in. Anyway for the price I paid compared to an english brand they represent very good value.

4,Lots of fun!,"We just got this and are still trying to figure it all out. We all loved the idea of building something, decorating it, furnishing it and then blowing it up! My only and main complaint is that it's too little. I want bigger pieces, they're all so small. A great idea though and maybe the next one will be BIGGER. My kids are 8 & 10 and they're having fun with it."
1,Outdated Software,"The description of this software lead us to believe it to be great. However, I couldn't install it in Windows 7 or Windows XP environment. Amazon was great in their service and fast refund. Yet it was a big disappointment."
5,America's Castles,This video shows some of the most spectacular houses built in America and the people that lived in them and how they made their fortunes. Very interesting video and highly recommended viewing.
1,Terrible product & service...,"Wrong product sent (he was out of the one in the picture). Instead he sent the one with the more up to date picture of the young man. It has much less powder than the one pictured and costs 2/3rds less. The stuff does not work at all. When i was a kid I ordered very cheap itching powder and it worked great --- not too strong, not too weak. This is very weak. It produces a very minor irritation, not an itch. It is claimed to be fiberglass but I've read it is not. So the formulation in the sent one was probably cheaper, too. The package is so small --- but doesn't work anyway. I suspect he pays less than a nickle per package of this very cheap stuff.Amazon should force him to change the picture to the correct itme he is selling. Of course, then he would have to reduce his prices by 2/3rds.First bad vendor on Amazon. Stay away for all products. Dishonest and greedy."
3,Entertainment Only,"Even though the dinnerware has received bad reviews, I bought a few serving/entertainment pieces from the Napoli line. Perhaps because I don't use them every day my opinion is different. They look great and serve my only purpose, which is to display food at the dinner table and at the occasional dinner party. I have had no problems with the entertainment pieces. I take really good care of them knowing they are somewhat fragile. I bought them because they truly look beautiful and knew ahead of time they would be used occasionally."
5,Cute!,I bought two 16pc Napoli dinnerware sets and now am working on the accessories. This dip bowl set is cute. The bowl is the perfect size for dips and many other things. A great value!
3,NOT LIKE I REMEMBERED,"I remembering Mr & Mrs North as a program that I always like, but I was a lot younger then. I have bought a lot of old black and white, (ie) hoppilong and moto, charlie chain mr wong and it was clear, but Mr. and Mrs North was not as I remembered and it was fuzzy. The plot was just as fuzzy as well as the acting.I gave it a 3 star for memories on vol 2 but I don't feel that vol 1 will be better.John from ga, usa"
1,Not The Sperry Topsiders I knew!,"This was not the quality of Sperry Topsiders that I have come to know and like. The shoes were so stiff that they were uncomfortable and unwearable. I returned them with great disappointment. Sperry as I remember them were soft pliable leather that were comfortable from Day One.Warren LittrellGrayslake, IL"
2,Too bad the Globetrotters movies were missing!,"I bought this DVD for my son who likes Scooby & Batman, but I was looking forward to the Globetrotters episodes as well. After reading one of the previous reviews that said those episodes were on the other side of the DVD, I turned it over only to get an error message that said ""Insufficient DVD."" The DVD would only play right-side up with only the Batman episodes. Obviously there is a defect with this particular DVD being mislabled as containing the Globetrotters episodes when it does not. Try explaining to your 2 1/2 year old why he can't watch what you just told him you were going to let him watch. Not fun."
2,Amazon shopper,"So i read all the reviews and despite what people were saying I still ordered it hoping there was nothing wrong with the dvd and sure enough the harlem globetrotters episodes were missing,the back side would not play and its so frustrating buying something and having that feeling like your getting ripped off because your not getting what you payed for so people pay attention to the reviews"
1,No Scooby-Doo Harlem Globetrotters Movie on this DVD!,"Same deal as the other reviews, there is no Harlem Globtrotters Movie on the reverse side of the DVD (Side B). Very disappointing as that is the only reason I ordered this DVD for my kids. DO NOT ORDER THIS COMBO DVD!"
2,Roll the dice and take your chances,"Ordered this for our grandson who loves Scooby Doo (and Batman). I saw this combi-disc, and thought for about the price of the Scooby Doo Meets Batman disc, he'd get a second Scooby Doo adventure film to entertain him.Sadly, we received a defective disc as the side B would not play in anything I tried it in. According to my computer blu-ray drive, there are files on the side B, but nothing playable.My two star rating is like this; 5 stars for Side A that plays great and 0 stars for Side B that doesn't - average and round down.So, roll the dice and take your chances with this one. You may get lucky and receive a fully playable combi-disc. I've returned this and ordered two separate discs of each feature to be (hopefully) certain the two features play. I don't want to roll the dice and come up snake-eyes a second time, when this was a Christmas for our visiting grandson."
1,NO Harlem Globe Trotters on side 2!,"I bought this DVD for my son and as some of the other reviews say, only the Scooby Doo meets Batman side works. The Harlem Globe Trotters side caused an error in all of my DVD players and wouldn't play."
5,Great book for anyone interested in goaltending,"This is a fabulous and very detailed book about the history of goaltending. The book spans from the very first goaltenders all the way to today's goalies. The book has many great pictures along with stories and interesting facts. The book got me interested right away. It shows pictures all the way from before the 1900's and up to today. Famous goalies such as, Jaques Plante, Terry Sawchuck, and many others. I highly recoment this book for just about anyone. This would be a fabulous book for any goaltender currently playing on a team. The book is so well done and easy to read and follow it really brings you into the time of the earlier goaltenders. Just overall...a great book"
3,Grandpa's Shave,The brush holds a lot of water. Works very well. The soap doesn't foam like others that I have used. This can lead to a dry shave by the end with soap to make it a bit sticky.
5,A New Standard filter for GM vehicles,"Well made filter with the great feature of a removal/installation nut welded to the can. This feature makes removing and installing the filter a 10 second task with none of the problems of a filter wrench. The 1017 fits many newer GM models with the bypass built in. Fits both my Corvette, and my wife's Aura. It's also been rated a top rated performer in filter test through the years. Forget the orange can, this is the real deal."
5,great skillet,this is the best buy you can get. this cast iron skillet was very easy to seasoned and cooks great.i'm from louisiana and live in cajun country and the one thing we do best is cook. this pot is great for making gravy to go over your rice.
2,Needs Better Instruction!,"Not for the novice!If you want to start cooking with cast iron, you will need to research and educate yourself on the care and cooking of this high maintenance tool. I cooked meat on this skillet straight out of the box and the seasoning came right off. I didn't know how to re-season and it developed rust by the morning. I am in the process of developing a good seasoning but it is a major investment. you have to scrub all the rust off and put it in your oven for hours. the skillet smokes, and it is really unpleasant. I've had this product for a year and have yet to develop a non-stick surface. I'm not giving up get on this skillet but just be warned.Just a note: until you get a good patina on your cast iron, only fry food in your cast iron."
3,"Great pan, but...","Great pan, at great price. None better for a lot more money. However, I find that I am much too lazy to use this pan. I like to use a pan and wash it, but with this pan, you have to season it with oil every time and clean it with a plastic brush. This is a problem for me because I use it camping, and I don't have anything but steel wool. What's more, you can't use soap to clean it. If you have some time and are patient, get this. If not, well....don't"
1,cracked,"I seasoned this skillet according to Lodge's instructions by coating it with melted vegetable shortening (crisco) and putting it in the oven upside down at 350 degrees for one hour, then letting it cool. When I removed it from the oven the side was cracked! I havnt tried to contact lodge yet because frankly for the price it just isnt worth my time and hassle. I'll pass on their products for the future though."
1,Perfectly awful item,"I'm afraid I have to agree with the negative responses about this item. First of all, it is *not* black, as indicated in the graphic. This is NOT the black, cast-iron skillet my mother and grandmother used. On the contrary, it is silver-grey in color, and--despite several attempts to season it--has rust splotches in the bottom and leaves the food tasting like metal. I'm hoping I can take it back to Target and get my money back! Target is usually pretty good about returns. I just wish I hadn't spent nearly the cost of the item in shipping online! Avoid this item."
1,This skillet takes forever to ship,"If you need this skillet in a resonable amount of time after you order it (like maybe a month or two) it's probably a good idea to buy it elsewhere.Once the skillet finally arrived, it was real good quality just like all of the other Lodge cast iron ware."
5,Great pan!,"This is wonderful for going between the stovetop and oven, and it browns like nothing else."
5,Good and Old Fashioned,"I've used all kinds and types of cookware and here I am, full circle. This is the best. I recommend this skillet to anyone just starting as a foundation piece and to anyone else as that filler piece you should have had all along. Once cured according to instructions, it's easy to use. It is heavy, but I really don't care. I'm teeny and over the hill, but find I prefer a pan that doesn't wobble off the stove and that keeps an even heat. I have it hanging right by the stove- a handy tip passed on by my cousin, which has put it to use almost every day since it showed up...even to oven roast potatoes. Which it did admirably. And check out that price!!!!! Get the lid while you're at it. Unless you're getting the 7 quart dutch oven which comes with the lid -another must have."
5,A Kitchen Essential,"To be brief and to the point -- There is not substitute for the cast iron skillet in the kitchen. No other metal can buld and hold the heat that cast iron can.This pan is good for just about anything except sauces. Use it to make breakfast, fantastic steaks, fried chicken and even cornbread. Lodge is the best and you can visit their website for more ideas and care instructions.Speaking of care, it don't get easier. Simply wipe out with a paper towel. If you need to use water, use plain hot water - never soap. The more you use the pan the more nonstick it gets. Needless to say it will last a lifetime and then some.I use mine so much I store it on the lower rack of my oven."
4,Great Pan/Does Require Some Extra Attention,"In my family we have a cast iron fry pan that has been passed down from generation to generation for almost a hundred years. Since I knew my mother wouldn't be parting with it any time soon I decided to buy my own. The Lodge Cast Iron pan is of the same excellent quality as my mothers. The only drawback to using a cast iron pan is the extra attention it requires. It needs to be seasoned before its first use, and most be coated with some type of oil after each use. But if you give your pan the extra attention it deserves it may well last you a hundred plus years also."
2,"Decent, but not the Paderewski","Don't buy this edition if you are under the impression that it is The Paderewski Edition published by Dover. This is now the new Carl Mikuli edition published by G. Schirmer (perhaps the worst edition in the world) reprinted by Dover. Dover used to publish this from The Paderewski Edition; however, for some reason, it's gone out of print. If you can get your hands on an old copy of this from The Paderewski Edition, I would highly advise buying it! It's much better, and more true to Chopin's intentions. Even if you can't find an old Dover copy, The Paderewski edition is still published privately. Don't buy this edition, it's truly a waste of your money."
4,not quite complete,"Notes are printed clearly. Binding is durable. Pages won't come out easily. This is not a complete edition of Nocturnes and Polonaises. This book has only 11 Polonaises and does not include 5 more Polonaises. Despite being criticized spurious by some music scholars, the omitted Polonaises are great for playing. It does not include the other postumous C minor Nocturne. If you want a book that is different from G.Shirmer's edition, this book will NOT do."
2,Not the correct edition,"This is NOT the Paderewski edition even though they are listed as the editors. The book is fine, though it is missing several piano pieces expected from the Paderewski edition. It is an incomplete version of nocturnes and polonaises."
5,It confirmed a lot of our ideas,A friend got me in the loop to read the book. great stuff. It confirmed a lot of our ideas about where things could be going here.
5,great book,This is a great history book and very interesting. I used it for my class. It was very helpful. Thank you
1,"great concept, poor design","Cast iron is the only way to go when you are cooking on anything over 30,000 BTUs. Lodge has a lock on this market. Trouble with this wok is the sides are not high enough. As soon as you start mixing, your food goes sliding up and over the side. Also, for the extreme weight, the handle should be wider; distributing the weight a little more broadly for the weak hand hold. I gave mine away after three months. I wish they would change the design; I'd buy three!"
2,What happened...,"...to one of my favorite authors? I've devoured almost everything Eileen Goudge has written, but had to plod through ""Otherwise Engaged"". My favorite book of all times is ""Garden of Lies"" an amazing and wonderful story. I find it hard to believe the same author wrote both books. I found ""Otherwise"" formulatic and rather boring. Please return to your usually writing style, Ms. Goudge!"
2,Predictable,"I expected this book to be predictable and shallow, and it delivered! It was a quick, mindless, yet entertaining, read. The characters were a little forced, but relatively believable. I woudln't say it completely lacks merit, but it's certainly not going down in history as quality literature."
1,Plain and boreeeng!,"The book is just that ""plain and boring""!!!I was really interested in the story line, I read with so much enthusiasm in the beginning, but that soon dwindled. I had to skip so many pages hoping against hope that something interesting would turn up. There was absolutely no connection between Jessie and Hunter. I felt what they had was way too cold for them to really be in love.I gave it 1-star because of the disappointing nature of the book, I had such high hopes....."
2,Missing something?,"I agree with what this reviewer, DlynB, said ""While this book was entertaining it lacked depth. There was so much going on, the main characters swapping lives, possible divorce and family problems with Erin, Jesse's past coming back to haunt her, the Navajo culture and then the water company destroying Willow Creek. With so many problems the author was left with little time to go into real depth concerning any of them. Throughout the entire book I was left wanting to know more.""I wish the author DID write more about the two women exchanging lives rather than going into details about other things that don't really go in this story. There should have been more depth, like the person I quoted said. This book would have been a lot more enjoyable if it had more about Jessie and Erin in the everyday daily activities. I would have liked to have been there when Jessie almost birned down the Inn. Things like that should have been included rather than being mentioned."
3,shallow read,"While this book was entertaining it lacked depth. There was so much going on, the main characters swapping lives, possible divorce and family problems with Erin, Jesse's past coming back to haunt her, the Navajo culture and then the water company destroying Willow Creek. With so many problems the author was left with little time to go into real depth concerning any of them. Throughout the entire book I was left wanting to know more. Every problem had a nice simplistic ending, except Mike, poor guy - why was he in this story? This book reminds me of my young students' writing. When they tell me a story they want to bring along all 12 of their best friends, but they don't tell me anything about them. At the end of their story their solution, they all go home and go to bed."
3,"Started out good, but...","I was really into this book for the first 100 pages or so, but then it started to get extremely confusing jumping back and forth between the two characters. I also found the story line very redundant. How many times were Erin and Skip going to almost fix their differences and then fall apart? I, too, found myself skipping through some of the descriptions further into the story; the wedding Jess went to with Hunter. I only gave it three stars because the premise of the story was a good one and it did start out alright, but then it just fell apart."
1,Don't waste a lot of money!,"The songs on here are worse than run-of-the-mill, they're either boring or annoying. The fact that there are multiple versions of nearly all only adds to the repetitiveness of each individual track. Being a fan of Madonna's should keep you from buying this: it's stuff she never intended to be released, especially at this stage in the game!"
3,"a good album, y do people keep dissing it","This album is good,and i like it. Its just a little bit odd."
1,CHEESE,I've been a die hard fan of Madonna since the beginning of her career.... but this CD STINKS! Sounds like the songs were mixed in a subway bathroom played on an old Casio keyboard. I'm shocked she would approve the release of this CD. Go to iTunes or Kazaa and listen to a sample first.
5,Great Replacement,This was a replacement for one that was borrowed from my tool pouch. Klein tools are the best for all of your electrical work. These make short order for installing switch and plug plates.
1,sorry,"I didn't care much for the book. It was woefully short on information about Mr. Bostic.Please, somebody write a REAL Joe Bostic story. He is a Black hero who deserves a well written biography."
4,Inspirational,"I found this book to be very entertaining and inspirational. George L Hiss found a unique way of categorizing the life of Joe Bostic while incorporating a brief history of his own life. I ended this book with the feeling of pride in my African American heritage, along with a new found drive to explore my own dreams and goals."
3,"good for small quantities, but weak on lots of carrots!","overall, it's a decent product. but, over time, i've found that when you juice more than 1/3 bag of carrots, the motor becomes weak, and does not extract as much juice as the first time around. the pulp is chopped up, but the juice does not get extracted. often, waiting half an hour for the motor to rest will revive the extraction process. but then again, what a pain!juicing apples or soft veggies/fruits is fine. and for the price, it's pretty good."
4,"Excellent, almost professional grade","This juicer is really good. I had initially purchase a Hamilton Beach juicer which turned out to be the messiest kitchen appliance I had ever bought. So I retruned it and selected a Braun based on reviews on this site and my personal experince with Braun products. And this really lived upto the Braun name. Reasons I would recommend this product:Very easy to cleanExtracts good amount of juice, probably just a little less than professional extractors would dothe tray is very handyfoam separator is not perfect, but does a decent job, if we wait for a few seconds before pouring out the juiceOverall, it is one of the best juicers for household use and I look forward to having fresh fruit juice everyday."
1,Too much pulp in the juice. Please reconsider before buying!,"Produces sooooo much pulp that it simply plops down into the juice cup. Simply awful! I had to STRAIN it every time (unless you enjoy 'thick', 'soupy' juice, of course). Pulp is completely wet. Basically, waste of money both - on the juicer and the amount of veggies used to produce tiny cup of thick, pulpy juice. Wish, I'd known what I know now before buying."
3,not that excited,"I received this last week and immediately opened it and began preparing to juice. Within 10 seconds some plastic pieces came flying out from the bottom. The motor kept running and finished the fruits already inserted. But there was much more pulp in the juice than I expected. Overall not very pleased and I am returning it and looking at another brand. Also very loud, and just does not seem very sturdy in person."
4,Honk,"This is just an all aroung great album. Moe. is well known in the jam community but this isn't simply a jam album, it's a great rock n' roll album with hints of psychedelia. These guys know how to write great songs without letting the jam get in the way. Moe.'s best studio effort to date. Keep up the great work guys."
4,disappointing comments,"""With the exceptions of ""Rise"" and ""Water,"" most of the songs here have been clipped to manageable size, making this Moe's most accessible album."" This is quoted from the editorial review. Sorry to use that cliche term, but Moe is a jam band. Rise and Water are the two longer songs and happen to be the strongest and closest to what Moe sounds in concert. Overall this is a very fun album and worth the listen. (sorry for the bitterness)"
4,moe is fun,"moe. is fun once in a while. I saw them at thanksgiving 2001 at Hammerstein Ballroom, NYC, and indulged in plenty of sweetbreath and bourbon. They're undeniably a great band, and their two guitarists have a way of churning out magic. While moe. is best experienced in the live context, Dither does a so-so job of capturing the essence of the live experience. Get the CD to familiarize yourself with some of the music before you see a show, but if you know moe., you don't really need this CD. Get on furthur and get yourself the real thing."
3,Moe. progress with Dither,"Moe's album Dither is their first since they parted ways with Sony 550 after their last album. From first listen it seems this new freedom has refreshed them and let them feel free to experiement in the studio. It has long been a problem for ""jambands"" to create solid studio works and Moe has always been aware of that. This time around it seems their getting closer to balancing what makes their magic live and utilizing the studio to layer and build their sound. Track 4(T6orm), Can't seem to Find, Rise, and Opium are standouts. Chuck and Al are definately 2 of the best guitarists live I have ever seen and Rob's(bass) vocals are really emotive and soulful. IT will be interesting to see what Moe does with this huge hole in the jamband scene by the Hiatus/demise of Phish and of course the grandaddy of them all The Grateful Dead.Moe are a band trying to find an identity in this sea of imrov rock bands and I really hope they survive. Dither is an excellent CD for any Moe fan."
3,moe. is a good live show,"However, I kind of have a problem with their lyrics, they often seem like they were written before the song and they don't always fit with the music (and usually aren't very deep or unique; mostly 'I'm on the road again'-type fare). The singer is pretty good, though (pretty sure he's the bassist)ALSO, ""The Faker""- hey, Welcome this is a Farmouse. After Phish released their ""No Woman No Cry"" clone, Moe. comes out with this, and change the chords around a bit, a bad song.I love to see Moe. live, they always are fun, but I don't think they are great songwriters, their stuff sounds better during the jams, that's what I'm listening for. They sometimes can't help sounding derivative, mostly when playing a ""rockin'"" tune (Mexico, Plane Crash, Capt. America - all pretty good, but hardly very original)DJ Logic - who is this guy? Every third show I hear about he's there spinning over a jamband. He sounded pretty good with MMW, he doesn't always find his place, though."
3,the rythm of the rain that pours...,"New York City... One of the best songs that moe. has written in some time and even better at the show. But Dither just doesn't gel together at any point - maybe that's the point for them. Songs with potential are definitely NYC, Captain America, Faker, and Opium, which have all been in the live show for some time. Tambourine and Rise just don't grab you at first listen. The biggest mystery is In A Big Country - good lyrics with total radio potential - aargh! It sounds too nice for moe. I do believe this album will take a few listens to grow on people - I'm still trying to figure it out. Regardless - moe. plays well for their fans and continue to play in small, intimate venues where people can get a good feel for their music. Dither is obviously what they wanted to do this time out - but I don't think I'm alone in saying that it's missing something."
3,It's Ok,"Dither was my first moe. album, when i first got it i was pretty dissapointed because this isnt at all like the moe. I heard before. It just dosn't show the high energy groove like the other albums. But after i got all of the rest of the moe. cd's I enjoy this one a lot more than i did before. Good songs on this are: Understand, Water, and So long. Songs like: Can't seem to find, New York City, and Tamborine are all kind of country-oriented. While songs like Captin America and Opium are like Rock. I guess thats what makes this a good album in some opinions. If your just getting into moe. go with Headseed or No Doy. if you have many moe. albums, this whould be a nice one to add to your collection."
4,Works for me!,"Higher traction than the tioga city slickers, but still fun! I installed these on my MTB for some road riding. It was as quick And easy as changing a tire. Received product promptly."
2,Pretty Lame Game,"The low-resolution, mostly 2D graphics are rather un appealing. The game opperates from a side view, 3rd-person perspective; much different from most console snowboarding games. Overall, gameplay is simple and boring; nothing exciting or interesting about it. It seems the only goal is to do tricks, which look very unimpressive, given the poor graphics.This game was a total let-down.Not recommended for those who like other snowboarding games."
2,Avoid.,"I do not like this game. It comes from a developer with absolutley no history and plays out to be a complete waste of time. The graphics are very bad, especially compared to the Game Boy Advance version. The controls take quite a bit of practice, and the trick catalog is serverly limited. There are only 4 freesytlye courses, where you might enjoy grinding your way down a vast assortment of rails. The games only real fun lies here, as nothing else will ever bring you back. Good for at least an hour, but you will never pick up this game again. If you need some handheld sonwboarding, try the Game boy Advance version of this, or try MTV Sports: Pure Ride Snowboarding on the Game Boy Color. Put this at the bottom of your list for BEST GAME."
2,"ZoneAlarm Pro ""User""","I've had ZoneAlarm Pro for about 18 months on my home computer. Unfortunately, some of the recent upgrades to the product now block me from accessing my HP printer. I checked on the internet and quite a few other people are having the same problem. I put ZoneAlarm Pro on my work computer and it caused connectivity problems and the IT folks at work needed to remove the application. I can no longer use the product because of the problems it causes."
5,The best of the lot,"ZA Pro 4 is very easy to use, and really protects my Windows 2000 Pro system, which is exposed to the Internet via satellite 24 hours a day. ZA Pro logs data on probes from the outside so I know that my machine (pre ZA Pro) was collapsing from massive intrusions, sometimes amounting to _thousands_ of attempts to invade per 24 hours. Now that does not happen, and my home net runs stably again. And that's another thing; ZA Pro allows easy access to internet connection sharing via W2000, and also did not interfere with my satellite modems (and other firewalls failed one or both ways). If you peek under the hood, you find that the default settings that allow you to start ZA Pro 4 up without effort hide a deep capability to customize everything. This is cleverly designed, useful software, worth every $."
4,Good product for advanced users,"This is a good product for advanced users who want detailed control over what access to grant each application. The setup can be intimidating for novice users. Norton Personal Firewall is a better choice for casual users because the setup and use is much more automatic. ZoneAlarm gives those who want to tinker with the advanced settings easy access to do so.One downside: the included ""12 months of free updates"" does not equal one year of updates. You get 11 full months plus the remainder of the current month. Therefore, if you register your product on the 28th of a month, you get 11 full months + 3 days of the current month. I imagine you could wait until the first of a month to register your product to ensure you receive twelve full months, but I did not figure out ZoneAlarm's definition of ""twelve months"" until after I registered."
3,Works but don't ask for customer service,"I have been using this product for 1yr and recently upgraded to the new version. I have had questions in the past about some problems, and had current issues. I find the technical support poor and lacking. responses are either lacking or extremely long to receive and don't solve the problem. I will most likly not purchase this product in the future.."
3,"Seems ok, once it is configured","Any type of firewall is important, especially if you are always connected. Once this is configured and you get used to it, it's pretty nice. Install the demo from their site first and use it for awhile, then decide."
2,"Great looks, poor plastic","I bought this Crystal clear case to protect my new Nokia N95, it fits perfectly and easily in the phone, looks great with it, I can access all the functions of the phone but the plastic is too delicate, I have never dropped it yet but it has already some crack lines in it, I'm affraid that if I accidentally drop it, it will break in so many pieces. Good idea and design, just need to improve the plastic material..."
2,it broke in 2 days,i had it for 2 days. droped my phone on the floor then it broke. just throw it in the trash. not worth it.
3,Almost perfect,"This faceplate does provide superior protection for your (investment) phone - no screen protector is needed with this unit! It is practically invisible once on the phone. Only thing is it only slides ONE WAY. With the case on, you can only slide the phone up, not down to access the media keys. Maybe I got a defective one, but other than that, I like this phone case. It just needs to provide access to ALL of the phones' functions."
3,cheap but serves its pupose,my battery compartment would not stay closed with this 6 dollar cover it stays closed now cant beat it !!!!!!
3,"Poor material, fits ok","The case is designed well. It fit over the front better than my last one did and I've yet to find a case that really fits the back. However, similar to most people here, the front started cracking in the corners. I've had it about a month now and have cracks in 3 out of 4 corners and I'm waiting for it to fall apart completely. I would recommend trying something else if you actually use your phone. Mine usually stays on my desk or in my pocket and the case is failing."
1,customer service,when i recieved the item it was broken so i wouldn't know how well it works. but i can say that amazon.com works very well with their customers to fix any problems that they might have with merchandise.
1,Very low quality plastic material - Amazon should not sell it,"I did not read the other reviews, too bad for me, got a crappie product. It fits very well on the phone, but it is not worth buying it. Try a different housing."
1,Not the best choice for your N95,"I purchased this in the hopes that it would protect the N95 while allowing clear access to all the features of the phone. 1) it fit on the phone quite well. it protected everything except the camera lens ( a concern ).What happened though, is that on the day it arrived, I put it on the phone. 24 minutes later the phone dropped accidentally, and the top right hand corner cracked about a quarter inch. ( the drop was about 1 and 1/4 feet. ).I was amazed at how fragile it was.So I removed the cover, and put one of these on the phone instead:http://www.amazon.com/Version-Krusell-Dynamic-Multidapt-Leather/dp/B0013L59RO/ref=pd_bbs_6?ie=UTF8&s;=electronics&qid;=1216164213&sr;=8-6Its sturdier, and protects the phone and camera lens better. not as pretty as clear plastic though.All in all, I regret this purchase."
5,Good Book,I love the conversation starter questions. It's fun to use with my husband on car trips! It's fun to randomly open to a question!
5,Wonderful!,The best book to have logical conversations with others. It doesn't matter if its with your partner or family and friends.
4,Christmas Gift,It was a gift for my son-in-law. They have gatherings of friends and thought this would be fun for them to get some great conversations going!!
5,Review of the Book of Questions,"I have seen the Jeff Probst's new show and he was using the Book of Questions, the questions were great and got you to think.So I bought this for my son, who loves this kind of mind games. Fun, ""what if"" type questions, would be great as a party idea.I love playing Trivial Pursuits, and this is one step beyond that.Carolyn G."
3,sentimental reasons,"I bought this book because I can't stand not having anything to exercise my mind. And it was exactly what they said it was, so i would buy again, but the purpose of this purchase was sentimental not just thought provoking."
4,a conversation starter,"If you have problems with topics for conversation keep this gem handy. There are some questions that are sure to peak everyone's talking bug. Some light hearted topics that will keep you talking for plenty of hours. Serious, humorous, thought provoking"
4,Good discussion starters,"Getting high school students to engage in a piece of literature is sometimes a challenging task. Stock's book is very useful for focusing students' thoughts on a very personal level. From there, we're able to have fascinating discussions on what kids really hold as important.A good book for introspection at any level."
5,Awesome book!,We used this at a party and it was awesome. I came here to get another copy as a gift.
4,Great Conversation Piece!,This book helps the timid and withheld burst from their proverbial shells and voice their opinions. Leaves much for discussion and open ended questions lead the readers in many trips down memory lane.
5,One useful little book!,"This book is definetely an inventive way to get to know someone without the embarassing silence that you use to think of questions... I picked it up one day while talking to a friend on the phone, and spent the rest of the day reading it! I have found things in people with the incidental use of this book that might not have shown up in everyday contact. A very good tool for discussion and discovery, highly recommended!"
2,"It's okay, but a little morbid","Okay, I own several other ""question"" books, and this is the least favorite in my collection. It's not entirely bad - it offers a lot of questions that people may not be able to think of on their own. It has a few fun questions about relationships, career, and personal life.The downside of the book was that it seemed to be overly morbid. Obviously, even the hard questions need to be asked, but MUCH of the focus on this book was on death, physical pain, disease, or likewise. Honestly, it really brought down the mood of a lot of conversations.It's a book that has its positive points, but I wouldn't consider it a ""fun"" book overall. Not recommended."
4,Great Conversation Piece,"My wife introduced me to this book almost 20 yeas ago and we still find uses for it today. It's great to have at parties and gatherings because it breaks the ice and gets people talking. There are endless spins you can put on the questions asked. They really make you think and examine yourself, as well as others. I recommend it."
1,Did not like,I found most of the questions to either be too silly or ridiculous. A lot of what if questions and questions that are not applicable to a lot of people. I would not recommend this book.
1,Not for meeting new people,"These questions in this book are not good ice breakers for meeting new people. They are meant more as intimate questions for people you already know. For meeting new people questions, I much more recommend ""The Conversation Piece"" instead."
4,Do you know your friends?,"Hi. I've got nothing better to do than review this book, so here goes... My friend Jenny and I have had countless hours of contemplation pondering the questions in this book. They have no correct answer, and involve people's morals and ethics. I really recommend this book to people who want to see how they'd react when faced with different hypothetical situations! Adios! :)"
1,Disappointed,Perhaps I expected too much based on all the positive reviews and it being a bestseller (the right title will sell) or just don't like hypothetical questions. Found it silly and not worthwhile.
2,Lame,This book is so small. And I would say I only liked 10% of the questions. They were really stupid. I don't recommend it.
1,A perverted view of life.,"Dr. Gregory Spock is a total pervert! These questions have forced me to conceal myself into a cardbord box, permenantely. Personally, I am a strong advocate against censorship, but this man needs to be stopped. Dr. Gregory Spot needs to be taken down! These questions have rattled me to my core. And my core, is deep. I fear that I will never be the same."
4,Fun book of interesting questions,"The title of this book is pretty explanatory. It is simply a book of questions (417 of them to be exact). There are no answers, no clues and no hints as the questions are merely designed to get people to think hypothetically about themselves, about others and about the world around them. Some of the questions are simple and fun to think about, others are intellectually and philosophically challenging.In general, most of these questions should be shared with friends/family/loved ones--that is to say that most people will probably not feel comfortable answering these questions in the presence of mere strangers. The book is a good way to learn more about other people you know and love or can be used alone to learn more about yourself and your own values.This is a valuable and simple book that is useful to have around the house and to glance at every once in a while by yourself or to pull out when engaged in thought-provoking conversation with people you know and trust."
5,A Wonderful Collection,"This book is a collection of writings from many sources. Although it is described as Buddhist Inspirations, it is not heavily Buddhist. Anyone reading passages in this book would not necessarily know that it's title included the word ""Buddhist"". Lovely, easily ingest-able. For me, the passages in this book are comforting, encouraging and compassionate. I always feel better or curious or consoled...whatever I'm needing at that time... after reading from it."
2,Mediocre mumbo-jumbo,"Today's reading: ""By renouncing samsara, we renounce our habitual grasping, unhappy minds. And by renouncing samsara, we embrace our potential for enlightenment."" Maybe I'm just too simple for this book, but I'm getting very little out of it. I've come across a few nuggets, but a lot of this is Greek to me. Not for the novice Buddhist or wisdom-seeker."
5,"Belongs Right Next to ""The Road Less Travelled""","At least once a month a psychotherapy client or a student in a clinical psychology graduate program asks me what to read for a psychologically sophisticated approach to spirituality. Without hesitation I always tell them about Frances Vaughan's ""Shadows of the Sacred,"" a work of such wisdom, warmth, and practicality that, after they read it, they'll probably want to see her for therapy. Vaughan's knowledge of both depth psychology and spiritual traditions is breathtaking. There's no wholly-headed New Age thinking here. This work belongs right next to Scott Peck's ""The Road Less Travelled."" It will be meaningful to men and women in all walks of life who are searching for the greater life they sense is possible."
2,Not one of Nancy's best,"This ""mystery"" isn't really that mysterious. For starters, we know from the beginning of the story who the bad guys are and that makes reading it a lot less interesting than the usual Drew mystery. I mean yes, you can tell who the bad guys are normally by seeing who the rudest and most suspicious looking characters are, but in this one we get the ringleader's name right up front: it's in the title!The only things left for Nancy and her friends to detect are a lot of scientifically naive componants to the bad guy's house, including poisoned portraits and a robot that runs off of ""tapes"" and attacks people. It's also the first Nancy Drew book I ever heard of that kills off the bad guy in the end instead of having the police take him away.Whoops, I spoiled it for you. But don't worry, the book is just as ho-hum when you know what's coming."
3,Women In Prison Movie,"Production wise, it's looks fantastic. Otherwise it's an average WIP movie made on a set. The Philippine & European versions tended to be a little more HC in action as well as torture. I understand the time period & how ground breaking this was in Japan at the time. How tantalizing. Dull & unimaginative by today's standards. Mix those two sentences up & you have an average movie with a lot of naked chicks behind bars."
3,wow,The NWA or WCW whatever it was called then must've thought idoits were watching their show. They put a fake sting in there trying to convince us that it was the real one. A blind person could've figured out the switch otherwise the video was straight. I loved Doom's music. The other thing that was really boring was the annoucing. It was so dull it was riduclous
3,What I'm the 1st to write a review on this!!!!!,"This is an OK video for a few reasons, the nastys vs teh stieners is worth buying the video by itself the main event is good and bad, sting and sid put on a good showing then sting is hurled out of the ring and a fake one comes in an its so obvious you'll be like whatever, but as usual jim ross is dead convinced sting just got pinned after of all things a body slam. If this wasn't bad enough sting comes back and discloses the fraud and then pins sid with a cross body of all things, we're talking about sid right? Either/Or it was ridiculous, but whats real ridiuclous is the red mat that literally blinds you for 3 hours. still it wasn't all too bad."
3,Paul E. #1 Color man in the Biz!,"Wow 1990 WCW...Ok u get Jim Ross (Talks about college football way toooo much) and Paul E. doing the commentating. JR is much better now and Paul E. is too toned down. Still they do a decent job. The main event is Flair VS Sting for the Title. No spoilers here but it was a greta match that had a great buildup 2 it. One of the other better matches is Luger defending the US title againist Mean Mark AKA pre-Undertaker. Get this tape just for his rare appearance in WCW. The event also saw JYD and man does he look bad here teaming up with Mr. Wonderful and El Gigante AKA Giant Gonzalez in the WWE taking on the horseman. The match is pretty boring but still good considering the horseman are involved. No other memorable matches here sorry. Wait if u are a Vader, his debut is right here againist Tom Zenk. I own it but would'nt pay more than 25 for it"
2,Not so great...,"Below expectations. First problem: the blade wasn't well aligned with the food tray (not perfectly parallel, but slanted at the top) so it is hard to get those perfect ""paper thin"" slices. Second problem: cleanup takes some work. You need to remove the blade and clean behind it after use, or food will accumulate. It takes some practice before you get even slices. On the plus side the mechanism works well. Overall the slicer is resilient and well built. I found it better to do thick slices than thinner cuts..."
3,Nice For The Price,"I've owned one of these slicers for several years & have gotten good service out of it until just recently. I don't believe I have overused the unit, but the carrier tray attachment has become harder to keep alligned. Most of all, the drive gear for the blade is nylon, instead of metal & no matter how I adjust it, I have had it ruin the teeth on several blades in the last year, which are not replaceable & require replacement of the entire blade unit by mail-order from the Rival Service Depot. Still, I find it is a decent buy in the low cost range for light duty use in the Susie Homemaker Kitchen. Just don't expect to carve those big Elk or Deer roasts in your freezer; this one's pretty much limited to the 2-4lb. range."
2,Rival Slicer,The stop on this slicer isn't parallel to the blade. This makes cutting even thicknesses impossible. No adjustment is provided.The are 4 small nylon or plastic pads under the blade that act as bushings to support the blade. All of these fell off by the fifth time is used it. The can't be reattached. The unit is too light and consequently skids across the counter top when slicing. Save your money - use a butcher knife.
1,It Failed!!!!,"I used this slicer twice. Once to slice eye round roasts (4 of them) and once for cabbage. I found that the machine slipped around the counter too easily and the carriage was shaky. I was slicing on the thick side, and that came out okay. Yesterday, I took it out to slice a two-pound, flat cut cooked corned beef for reubens. I tried everything, and it wouldn't start. Not even a flicker. Dead. I re-read the user manual checked everything. This is not brain surgery and I am mechanically inclined. However, right now, I'm more inclined to recycle it ... just not sure which bin to put it in - tin or plastic."
2,blades,I enjoy using your prduct. (The 101W Electric Steel slicer.) But I have sooooo much trouble finding the blades. Is there anyway you can stock them at the stores you sell this products?
2,Read Hemingway Instead,"I am disappointed to see that many of these reviews have called LTZ a book for a Lost Generation. Give me The Sun Also Rises any day - at least Jake Barnes had depth and feeling. I'd take Holden Caulfield, too."
2,It's A Book,"I don't really know what to say about this book. It's not something I was very excited about. Run-on sentences almost killed it. Not much was interesting in the book until about half-way where everything is described in a different perspective. It's as if some things, I think, the majority of people would see as odd situations, and very disturbing, but the main character sees them as something he doesn't have to care about. Several phrases are striking, and are remembered throughout."
3,Very Disturbing,"The plot of the novel is extremely disturbing. Bret Easton Ellis presents a sickening view of humanity in 1980's Los Angeles. This is not a book that I will read again, nor is it a book I would reccomend, although it is very well written and much too realistic. I found it far too easy to imagine the scenarios in the novel. This book is not for readers who cannot stomach the concept of twelve-year old children watching pornography, doing cocaine, or being sexually abused by rich teenage cocaine addicts. I wish I had never read the novel, as it is very depressing. Surely humanity is not as horrible as this...."
2,Meh,"Not a big fan of this book. I felt like I was reading an 80s version of Catcher in the Rye. It's hard for me to relate to spoiled, confused rich kids."
3,Why Should I Care?,"I love drug-related stories. I've read a bunch including William S Burroughs, Jack Kerouac, Hunter S Thompson, Hubert Selby Jnr., James Frey, Don Winslow... the list is long, which is why I picked up Less Than Zero.This is not a book for everyone as the themes are pretty dark and the writing style is an acquired taste. I can deal with sparse prose and a disaffected narrator, but what I really didn't enjoy was the main character's and narrator's disassociation from it all. He didn't care at all, he was just an idle observer of this slice of life and he never showed an ounce of emotion. Maybe that was the whole point, that Clay wasn't a participant in his own life but merely a bystander. Be that as it may, I just couldn't connect with a character that seemed to have no emotion whatsoever and like Clay, I had a hard time caring about anything that happened in the book."
3,Sinister enough...,A depraved look at teen-somethings going from house to club searching for drugs and something to do to pass time. But it pulls you in and doesn't let go. Ellis' writing is relentless and gripping and above all paints a picture of flawed youth that is sinister enough to be one hundred percent enjoyable but at the same time ends feeling unfinished and hollow.
2,"Grand ideas, unrealised.","I was surprisingly disappointed by Bret Easton Ellis' début - I expected so much more considering the attention this book gathered (maybe it was because a 21 year old wrote it?)Throughout it felt like an 80s Kerouac... and I'm not a big Kerouac fan. Apart from the few excellent quotes, there is little that impressed me."
4,Somebody's 80s,This wasn't my 1980s experience but I'm guessing Mr. Ellis experienced something like it. Blonds having sex and doing drugs while trying to cope with alienation and being young and rich. It's very enjoyable and makes one yearn for that era as one might Paris in the 1920s.
4,A good read. made me feel uncomfortable.,"i'd hate to be one of these kids living this party all the time, meaningless life. this was a good book but i was distracted by all the ANDs there were in it. ""and this and that and this and that"" no kidding, at some points it gets that bad. other than that, i wouldnt change a thing. over all a good book"
3,A sad but true tale of youth in L.A. in the 80's,Ellis captures the apathy and the excess of the lives of young twenty-somethings (and teens) in Los Angeles during the decade of indulgence. The saddest part of this story is these people really existed and that old cliche is true...money cannot always buy happiness.
3,"Drugs and Orgies, but Meaning?","As with Mr. Ellis' American Psycho I am once again forced to stretch my mind for a meaning for this book.The main character, Clay, is the expected disenchanted, disconnected youth. From there the book spirals down into the darkness and depravity which can only be contained in L.A. Almost every character in this book (even some children) uses mountains of drugs.I'm sure this is all presented as an example of ""Teenage Angst,"" but I couldn't relate to it. This may be because I'm from the Midwest and haven't been exposed to the situations this book deals with. Others may relate to it far better than I.The book is written very well and the storyline is intriguing. It was fun to read and I enjoyed it, but its no Catcher in the Rye."
1,Abysmal and Vapid,"Rarely does a movie improve upon a story told in a book; especially when the movie stars people like Andrew McCarthy. Yet even keeping that in mind, this book makes its film counterpart appear to be in the same class of cinematic achievment as ""Lawrence of Arabia."" I can honestly say that I have never read a novel with as little merit -- in terms of both style and substance -- as ""Less Than Zero.""In attempting to point out the shortcomings of his characters, Brett Easton Ellis actually appears to sympathize with them -- never do any of the people in this novel realize how shallow their lifestyle truly is. Furthermore, he uses a ludicrous, staccato style of writing, which accomplishes nothing so much as making the work seem like an MTV video.This book is the intellectual equivalent of watching Duran Duran videos while snorting coke."
1,Terrible,"I don't normally like to say this about a book, but in this case it is totally warranted. This book sucked. For starters, it was very obvious that the author was trying to be very Catcher in the Rye with this novel. I don't care for copycats.Second, the entire novel is about a bunch of over-privileged teenagers who do nothing but get high and whine. I hated every single character in this boo, particularly the narrator, Clay.When I closed the covers of this book, I was relieved to be finished but I couldn't help but wonder two things. How in the world did this get published and why do so many people think this is such an amazing novel?I wouldn't recommend this book to my worst enemy, if I had one. Stay away."
1,waste of time,"I enjoy a good book about nothing much, partying, sex & drugs etc... This book manages to make all the above uninteresting."
1,This book was a little too graphic for my tastes,"Um, this is pretty much like every other Bret Easton Ellis book, except it was the first, so I guess they are all like this one. It's about a bunch of rich kids who became jaded about life too early on. They do a bunch of drugs. Have a bunch of sex and commit crimes that don't really disturb them, including raping a 12-year-old girl. It's pretty good up until the end, where the 12-year-old girl came in. That was a bit too much for me.The thing I found interesting about this book is that it's based in L.A. and the people in it are exactly what I expect of the rich L.A. brats, even though the book was written in 1985. It's Laguna Beach, before Reality TV was invented. I seriously would have thought the book was written today, except for the references to playing the atari and putting movies in the betamax. That kind of dated the book a bit."
1,Really Bad!!!,"I loved the movie when it came out in the 80s....I usually think that books are better then movies but this was certainly not the case when reading Less Than Zero!!! This author writes in short bursts of thoughts and occurrences...No chapters, no fluid movement...Choppy at best! The Back cover of the book was the best part! Really made me want to dig in! Breezed though this book in about a day....Paging through, thinking ""it has to get better"", only to find that it doesn't....The names of most of the characters are totally stupid..How the movie and this book even shared the same title completely amazes me!! If you loved the movie...DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!! You will be asking yourself why you wasted your time on 200 pages of dribble! This books rating should be truly less than zero!!!"
2,Not that good.,"First of all, if you're looking for a clear-cut story, don't read this book. The only way it works is as social commentary, and that's only if you can take the characters seriously, which is really hard to do.Ellis kicks the novel off by trying to bait you into being disgusted by his characters. Everything they do is so incredibly over the top that it just gets silly. I really don't believe that most high-class LA types lived like this during the 80s. I think the story is really exaggerated, and I couldn't take any of it seriously."
1,"Wish It Were Zero (Stars, That Is)","I read this book when it first came out in the 80s. I actually read it three times. The first, because BEE was suppose to be the ""new!"" thing; the second, because I couldn't believe how bad it was and wanted to make sure I hadn't missed something; and the third, because I really had to make sure. I couldn't believe how terrible it was; I still can't. Please kids, take it from someone who was a young adult in the 80s, this book is not worth the time. Don't do it! Turn back now!Additionally, the movie was no better. I saw a screening of it in a packed movie theater on Boylston Street in Boston in the 80s. By the end of the movie, when you were suppose to care for these characters, most of the audience was laughing hysterically. It was quite sad (and funny)."
4,Nothing Like the Movie,"I read this book, because I really enjoy the movie Less Than Zero. For the longest time I didn't even know the movie was based on a book. Call me naive, I know. I enjoyed the book very much once I realized that the movie had nothing in common with it but the main characters' names and lots and lots of drugs."
3,Entertaining,"I'll start off by saying the movie and the book are totally different. I don't know which one is better, they both don't have a plot. It's about some rich kids who are screwed up. That's it! But, it does have interesting story lines like Julien the prostitute."
2,Was probably a good book in 1990.,This book is average. It was probably good in 1990 before reality TV. 2 stars is probably too much. Not a great book. Short review.
1,Another Pitiful Attempt,"Once again, this is simply a depressing and actually quite annoying novel, if you have the morals of a street bum and allow yourself to call it that.This book wasn't a waste of time, today's world demands sensless, mind-numbing, idiotic scribblings of the pen like these.To compare this to ""Catcher in the Rye"" is the greatest insult to ""Catcher"" that I can personally think of.Nor is it satirical, as some have said.By the third chapter, I was hoping that Clay would get in a car wreck while driving drunk, or possibly the book could just end and the rest of the pages could be blank.For God's sake, it doesn't even have one sober main character!Food poisoning is a greater joy than reading this shrill, insufferable, insolent, and downright intolerable book. It is, in short, quite possibly the worst book I have ever read."
1,Hands Up All Who Liked This Novel!,"Now, would all those who raised their hands please disqualify themselves from further literary judgments. Less than Zero is less than bad. It's tenth-generation derivative California noir by a silly trust-fund amateur with great connections and no talent. In many cases, critics can disagree and still respect each other; but if you liked this book, you're hopeless. From the clumsy allegory of its first line, ""Nobody knows how to merge in LA"" to its slow, formulaic visits to the most predictable sites of rich-boy decadence (snuff movies! cocaine! Whooooo, scary stuff!), it's Didion writ dumb, Chandler without corpses--unless you count the readers."
1,A depraved little piece.,"A story about a bunch of high-born low-lives indulging their nerve-endings while waiting for something, *anything*, to happen. A west-coast ""Kids."""
2,"Good movie, marginal book","Rarely do I enjoy a movie more than the book but it happened here. I watched the movie many times before I was aware it was from a novel. I eagerly awaited my read but found the movie not true to the book at all. In this case, that was a positive. Even with Andrew McCarthey's weak characterization in the movie, the characters are much more compelling in the movie than the book. There is really no one in this to like.As other reviewers have said, when you get a book with many great reviews and some totally disappointing reviews, it's probably something you should check out for your own taste. This may be such a book. I didn't get. Maybe you will. Great American literature? Not on your life!"
2,"More than Zero, Less Than Three","This book gets one star for writing about ""something different."" BEE definitely ""made it new""- which is more than we can say for some of these fossil novelists publishing tripe to rave reviews (Seek My Face, anyone?). He gets another star for being so young. Twenty is an age at which we can still be justifiably self-absorbed.Minus one star for over-the-top and unrealistic plot- which it WAS, no matter what kind of background BEE was attempting to portray. Minus another star for the overly stylized dialogue, which even Andrew McCarthy couldn't flesh out. Minus another star for the rip-off of a conclusion. At only 200 pages, BEE could've continued with Less Than Zero for mere days and come up with something half-plausible.It should count for something that the film cast included the ever-hot James Spader (Yow!), but not on this board."
2,"Not bad, not great.","I have mixed feelings regarding this book. It wasn't until the final 50 or so pages that I saw any glimpse of humanity in these characters. Ellis does a good job of nailing their vacuous lives but it became reduntant and boring. At the end the narrator realizes the horror of it all and it ends on a hopeful note - though it is not a wrap-it-all-up happy ending, thankfully. Ellis' habit of describing wardrobe is seriously annoying and useless except to date the novel. And any comparison to ""Catcher in the Rye"" is laughable. Why would Gen. X need a ""Catcher in the Rye"" anyway? It already has THE ""Catcher in the Rye."""
2,"Certainly not a feel-good book, but kinda interesting.","I guess I read this book about a year ago, and as I remember it, I found it disturbingly empty and heartless -- which is, of course, the point of the novel. As a result of lives filled with nothing more than quick sex, lots of drugs, and meaningless, phony ""friendships"", the teenage characters in the book seem utterly devoid of genuine emotion, other than despair, which is expressed obliquely. I suppose this book reflects reality for a certain segment of the population, which is unfortunate."
2,panacea for the attention-deficient,"This book is great for people who want a superficial and supercilious piece of ""literature"" to talk about in front of others to make themselves appear more artful. The book is a quick rush, it is indeed exhilarating and unrepentantly self-abasing, but the style is amateurish, there is little emphasis on characterisation, description, irony, or drama, and the intent of the author appears to be merely to shock, not to illuminate or enlighten as Art should. In addition it is devoid of any degree of philosophy or denouement. Perhaps this is the author's intent, and if it is he has accomplished his goal, but I would certainly hope that our culture could produce authors with much more noble literary aspirations. It's worth a read if you have two hours and don't expect too much."
4,I Liked It,"I have never seen the movie but I did have an idea of what this book was about. At first I was under the impression that it was merely telling the tale of what Clay's life was like a daily basis living in L.A. But towards the end I started to think about how when you expand your horizons (as Clay does when he goes the school in New Hampshire)it makes you see things differently. I enjoyed it. This is my first Bret Easton Ellis book. I am thinking of going onto ""American Psycho""."
4,another aspect of cultural studies?,"i read this book in one sitting. yes, it can be a bit trashy, and yes, i felt a little guilty indulging in characters that SEEM shallow, but this novel is very thought-provoking at the same time. i actually enjoyed pondering 1980s urban teenage angst. what makes it any less important than another period or culture? anyway if you want to at least be entertained and sucked into a story, this is an excellent choice."
3,Could have been so much more,"This is a good book, but certainly not great. One of the main problems is it is caught between two styles; all at once it is very basally thin on development but with long explained sentences of physical surroundings which were analogous to the story. This is especially at the beginning. What this brings is a superficial glazing over the character's lives which doesnt seem to go anywhere meaningful or exceptional. It is good for the quick read that it is, however, but a little more depth would have made it much better."
5,A haunting masterpiece,"To keep it short; Ellis debut is a seminal achievement and is still his best novel. The bleak picture he paints of the youth of that time is precise and very disturbing. He knew what he was writing about and he did it in a way that captured the atmosphere very well. Unfortunately, Ellis seems to have lost the touch. Will he ever return?"
1,Dont be fooled by the obvious,"I have no idea why people are so enthralled and drained from reading Bret Easton Ellis books. People think they are profound and raw, but really, they are only blatantly obvious and just trying to shock. Well, i've read this book as well as American Psycho. All of Ellis' books have the same theme: indifference, no feeling, vanity. Who cares! He could have written than with one book. Can't his mind stretch a little farther to include some more topics? If you were fooled enough into thinking this book was a work of art, you're probably one of those grunge people who like to impress everyone that you're reading ""serious"" stuff. I'm incredibly open-minded when it comes to reading and movies. This book was just incredibly boring."
4,More than zero...,This book was tight. I really loved it and could relate to it being a private school snob. Plus...my sister goes to the high school that they mentioned. Sweeeettt....
1,Gratuitous Sex and Gore Which Holds No Relevence.,"This book is written on pure shock value. There is no plot. How was this book ever published? All this book does is disturb the reader. The subject matter of a lost generation is overdone and thus cliche'd. This book holds no relevancy as a moral work or for any genre of literature for that matter. The characters are like those of a Stephen King novel: vacant. I would give the author merit for turning a first person narrative into a third person narrative by showing the detachment of the characters, but when analyzed we can see that it is purely the fact that there is no character development. This book is not a zietgeist piece, its' not a moral piece, it's just well... pornography."
1,"The handwriting on the wall says ""Palahniuk""","I first finished this book last summer, and clearly remember feeling robbed and violated. The protagonist is written as being tremendously apathetic, but carries absolutely no message. (For unfeeling characters with something to say, see Salinger's ""Catcher in the Rye"", or Camus's ""The Stranger."")Poorly written prose creates a text with literally no entertainment value, and hardly any redeeming qualities. Those of you reviewers who seem to think this novel speaks volumes about youth need to remember that very few of us are braindead richkids with no direction. For a writer with a talent, and a message to boot, I suggest you look up Chuck Palahniuk, and ""Fight Club."""
1,The most accurately titled book ever written,"This book is a profound, disturbing, true-to-life expose of . . . what exactly? The characters, with their laughably stilted speech and their contrived actions, bear not the slightest resemblance to any individuals or subculture recognizable from the real world.Even his portrayal of self-absorbed, materialistic rich kids is off. I went to high school and undergrad with plenty of such kids, and either they were driven to succeed so that they could retain their self-absorbed, materialistic lifestyle, or they were too busy being hung over to act as Ellis depicts.As for the incessant, glamorous partying with no consequences, has Ellis ever heard of the banality of evil? Doesn't anyone in his universe ever get into a car wreck when stoned or catch crabs from the promiscuity?"
1,Life's too short to read this book,"After reading so many positive reviews of this book and enjoying so many books that have been compared with this novel,I decided to read it . Upon searching everywhere I finally found this ""gem of a novel"".I dove into this book with enthusiasm but by the end I was more than a little disapointed .Not only were there too many insignificant characters, they were all completely flat and uninteresting .As an avid reader I have never read a book with such a boring protaganist.With all the usual components of what i find to be a great read : glamorous , oversexed, and drugged up rich kids, somehow this book just dosen't work. Don't waste your time. If you want a similar but MUCH better read try TWELVE."
1,Boring,"I don't know why I picked this up after hating American Psycho so much. I guess I wanted to give the guy a chance.I mean, I get it - Clay has a completely pointless and wasted existence. So does everyone else in the book. And that's it. Nothing happens, it never goes anywhere; and you end up not caring, either. Reading the book was a total waste, too."
1,don't bother,Do not waste your money on this book.There is no plot and no direction. Such a waste...
1,Poor Little Rich Kids,"An awful book. It glamourizes the worst excesses of the 1980's: meaningless sex, rampant consumerism, drug use and youthful apathy. If whining rich kids bemoaning their existence sounds exciting, try this. If you want a well written and stimulating book, go elsewhere."
1,Boring!,This book is so boring! I cannot believe that I wasted my time reading it. The book might deal with rich kids problems in Beverly Hills and the problems may be real but gee nothing happens in the book! It is like the book just goes around in circles forever. Would never recommend this book to anyone!
3,Not as great as American Psycho,I got right into Ellis after American Psycho and I'll say I didn't think this book as up to the same par as American Psycho.Ellis still does a great job of explaining things in great graphic detail but this book was still missing something. I felt that it really didn't go anywhere. I kept waiting for the main character Clay to get into something but all he did was meet his friends and go to parties.I will continue to read Ellis books but I don't suggest this as one of his reads.
3,"Good--a little depressing, but good.","Very thought provoking, but not for the faint of heart. You should not read this book if you can't handle some pretty graphic imagery. Lots of reviewers have complained that there is no plot--and I'd have to disagree. The plot to this book is the downward spiral of Clay, the anti-hero. Sad, indeed--but very interesting."
4,The road of excess in the 1980's,"This is a good review of the road of excess in the 1980's drug/club scene, even though it was written in the 80's it is still relative today. Good characters and unexpected twists and turns. I liked it very much."
3,"After nihilism, not much else.","B.E.E. can write in an interesting manner. Little phrases resonate in your mind, partly through repetition, partly just because they just great little summations of ideas - ""people are afraid to merge""...""disappear here"". There are memorable interactions. But you go through the book, and people talk about this material thing or this trend and then it becomes obvious you are just following a bunch of empty, nihilistic people, and nothing really seems to happen. Well, I guess I can remembering one major bad revelation. But...why? Maybe you love this book if you can really relate to nihilistic feelings? Or maybe get something out of being shocked by the lifestyle? I don't know...I definitely didn't hate it, and I got through it okay (I stop reading a lot of books 1/4-1/2 way). I guess I just didn't get much out of it. (PS I am 34 and I knew all the references.)"
3,A Book About Too Much and Too Little,"The last lines of this book sum up my feelings towards it perfectly: ""There was a song I heard when I was in Los Angeles by a local group. The song was called ""Los Angeles"" and the words and images were so harsh and bitter that the song would reverberate in my mind for days. The images, I later found out, were personal and no one I knew shared them. The images I had were of people being driven mad by living in the city. Images of parents who were so hungry and unfulfilled that they ate their own children. Images of people, teenagers my own age, looking up from the asphalt and being blinded by the sun. These images stayed with me even after I left the city. Images so violent and malicious that they seemed to be my only point of reference for a long time afterwards. After I left."""
3,Disturbing/Interesting,"""Less than Zero"" explains life as a college eged person according to Clay. He is on his Christmas break and pretty much talks about all of his social encounters, going over every deatial no matter how disturbing it may be. For example the way him and his friends did drugs, got drunk, had sex and used F*** a lot. It even describes the disgusting details fo the sexual assult of a young boy and what they did to him. They have these huge parties and dont have a care in the world other then getting drunk, sex and drugs all on their Christmas Breaks. It;s scary to think that this is still true for some people."
4,no rose colored glasses here,wow. this book shows la in its true light. bret doesnt mix words here. he tells it straight from the heart. very dark but still a good read.
4,"LTZ: Quick and easy, like most of the characters","I read this book in only about five hours, pretty quick for a two hundred page book. That's because Ellis' first novel obviously appears just that...his first, and it shows.I've read American Psycho, which is ultimately a way way way better book, but this novel is not without its moments. I like it for its somewhat untraditional style, it doesn't dwell upon details and istead focuses upon a dreary, fuzzy existence. You really get the sense that Clay(the narrator) could actually have written this book, and his pitifully drugged out existence is so cloudy it transcends into the readers mind. Seriously after I read this book, I had half the mind to go around snorting cocaine and boning random chicks. Of course then I realized Ellis was telling us NOT to do that. Anyway, its entertaining enough for a quick and interesting read."
2,Anticlimactic-- 2 1/2 Stars,"I found this to be a quick, easy read that built up to a very dissapointing conclusion. A good way to pass some time but not a very good read."
3,Less Than Zero,"Less Than Zero is a book about a young man who grows up on the only things he has-drugs and his parents money. This book was greatly written but a little too much on the dark and depressing side. If you like hardcore drama, this is a great book, but even being one who likes to read disturbing books, I found this a little intolerable."
5,L A in paperback form,Ellis captures Los Angeles in all of its self-absorbed and hyperbolic superficiality. Less Than Zero is a wickedly decadent look at people whose lives have been hollowed out by excess and boredom. Ellis' rushed style and choppy sequences add to the overall disengaged and surreal environment that the book is set. As essential a read as a Thomas Guide for any Left Coaster.
3,Slow but by no means bad...,"Ellis writes with a style, that in my opinion is far too descriptive. To me, this bogged down an otherwise good read. It's a disturbing portrait of wealthy teens who cant seem to feel or care about anything. Despite being somtimes slow this novel made me identify with it's protagonist, even when i didn't want too. As the novel progressed i felt truly disturbed...and hey when a book can make you feel half as much as this one does it's at least worth picking up, right?"
3,Pretty Good,"Sure I got it and everything, but the fact that not much happens was a turn off. I definetly think it's worth reading, but if the book had been longer it would have been boring. Ellis definetly can establish mood and the utter hopelessness of his characters are what kept me reading. I will probably pick up more book from this author."
2,An apt title 'cause it's a whole lotta nothing,"I bought this becauseThe Hollywood Assistants Handbook: 86 Rules for Aspiring Power Playerslisted it as required reading for anybody from outside the Thirty Mile Zone who wants to work in Hollywood so they'll understand where their future coworkers who grew up in the Thirty Mile Zone came from. The problem is there's no real story to it. It's just one long stream of college-age kids hanging out, watching TV, doing drugs, and having primarily gay sex in circa-1984 Los Angeles. Granted, it's a first novel written by a college kid, so I might be expecting a bit much from it, but it's just so bland to the point where the ""Less Than Data"" parody of it inTreks Not Taken: What If Stephen King, Anne Rice, Kurt Vonnegut and Other Literary Greats Had Written Episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation?was more engaging. Forget the comparisons toThe Catcher in the Rye, this is more on a par withDay of the Locustbut without the social commentary."
2,Pretty lame,"I'm a huge fan of literary fiction, but I was bored throughout 3/4 of this. I read on because it felt as though it was just about to get interesting...it never did."
4,"For a first novel, not bad","Ellis' best novel is American Psycho. But in Less Than Zero one can see the direction Ellis was heading in: first-person monologue narration, disillusioned, vapid characters and scenes of disturbing violence. This novel is very good, especially when considered in the context of being a first novel. It's one I will re-read and continue to study. Some have compared this work to Catcher in the Rye, but it's more aptly linked to The Great Gatsby with its hyper-realism and trouble in paradise themes. However, in Less Than Zero Clay never finds out what he wants, never pursues it, and learns nothing. And in that regard, Ellis outdoes Fitzgerald. Ellis has the art of the tight sentence down, but Fitzgerald is more moving and beautiful. But Ellis' intention is to shock, which he does very well. Unless you've already read American Psycho, and then Less Than Zero might slightly underwhelm you."
2,Vapid,"A boring look at boring vapid people. There is no purpose to this book, just as the characters have no purpose to their life. With so much excellent literature out there it is a shame to see this compared to Catcher in the Rye. I know the book is showing us what a wasteland LA is- the book is also a wasteland. This was better than American Psycho but only because it was shorter."
4,More than Good,"What a book. Brief and spare in so many ways. I read Less Than Zero recently out of a sense of obligation more than anything. Though I'm ten years younger than Ellis and the characters in his 80s books, I still consider myself a child of the 80s much more so than the 90s. As such, Less Than Zero is akin to required reading.Never had the pleasure of cocaine, but I saw its impact (and that of crack) around me in popular culture. Less Than Zero is reminiscent ofAmerican Psychoin the similarly detached self-indulgence of the narrator/main character in each. Though I have not seen the movie forLess Than Zero(perhaps a sin for someone who claims to be a child of the 80s), I have caught enough snippets of the movie through the years to see that it's not quite the same.Good writing, though. Compelling story that probably appeals more the closer you are to having been in your 20s during the 80s and maybe it helps if you lived in Los Angeles for a while too."
4,"sounds a bit like college, only more extreme","This was the first Ellis book I read. I enjoyed it a lot. Ellis is has a unique style, and I'd consider him among the top contemporary authors. Less Than Zero took the college experience, and juiced it up a little. The only problem with the book is that there doesn't seem to have a conclusion, it just ends. Over all, I really enjoyed the book, and would recommend it to those who are somewhat facinated with the so called ""drug culture."" Bottom line... good book!"
3,Nice collar but spendy,"It's stiched through and not just printed, but a metal snap would be nicer on such a collar. The large is perfect for 50+ lb dogs."
1,Truly pathetic...,"I am not given to writing negative reviews and I cannot ever recall giving anything one star before, but this machine is a joke.I have probably used 6 different types of 'weed whacker' over the years and this is by far the worst starting machine of any kind (even given that 2 stroke engines are the work of the Devil) I have ever attempted to use.Apart from being a nightmare to start, the wretched thing cuts out prematurely after a max of 10 minutes, either due to overheating or a lousy fuel system.Maybe I was just unlucky with this particular machine, but this monstrosity should never have slipped past quality control. That is, if they even have any."
5,Great price,This was definantly the best I found for the price. Works great. Shipping was fast. I would recommend this product to anyone needing a gas trimmer.
5,So versatile!,"I love cooking with cast iron. These fajita sets are so versatile. We do our steaks on them. Heat the skillets on the grill first, get them RED-HOT!.... then drop your steaks on them. Turn once. And serve them to guests SIZZLIN'... Your guests will be impressed... and of course they're good for fajitas, too. Ever tried drop biscuits on them? Drop some butter, preheat the skillets, then drop the biscuitdough on. Just tried cooking fresh fish filets on them. Spray w/butter flavored Pam, preheat, bake at 350. Yummy!The secret to castiron cooking is to PRE-HEAT IT!!! andd when you're through, wash up, turn upside down in heated oven to dry. Protects your seasoning of skillets...."
4,"Great for pancakes, too!","My brother gave us this for Christmas. At first, I was pretty disappointed if only because a pair would make more sense for a family of four. This pan is not very large and at this price, why not splurge? However, this is a fantastic pan for pancakes. It heats quickly, it makes one fast, fluffy, huge pancake at a time, it's a breeze to clean, and it's sort of funny! Also the potholder is useful when I use my ""real"" pans."
2,Not what I expected at all,"I was looking for something to use while on my rowing machine that would give me the visual effect of rowing along a waterway. I thought this would be a water-level trip in a canoe as it paddles through pristine wilderness waters, viewing the water and the shore as it passes by. Instead, it is a slide show of beautiful scenery and nature set to ho-hum new age music. Very static and frankly pretty boring. The visual equivalent of prozac."
5,Great overview of a great Italian Pop Singer,"Great compilation of his works from the 60's and 70's. All the hits are here from 'Rose Rosse' to Pieta. Highly recommended and its about flaming time his music has been released on CD. The music quality is quite good. The mastering was done quite well. If you like Italian Pop from that period, this CD is for you."
5,Massimo On Cd !,Its about time that Massimo Ranieri's songs were presented on CD instead of my dad's old 8 track player and LP.Massimo has a lot of great Italian pop songs from the late 60's and 70's and he has a great voice. If you like pop music from this era and you like the sound of a great Italian singer give Massimo Ranieri a shot you will like what you hear especially on this greatest hits package.
4,Deep Purple with King Diamond Style Organ-Playing,"This is a great raw raw recording of a practice session for King's first band in 1980. Expertly remastered to hi-fi! The musicians are very good, and the music is great. Just what I thought it would be. The baroque-esque organ really makes the transition from this band's Deep Purple influences to King Diamond's style.King's vocals are undeveloped at this point, rarely using his falsetto. Based on musicality, he was probably the weak-link in the band, but that makes the album even more authentic. Great guitar-work.Great original songs, very catchy. Difficult to make out the lyrics, through heavy Dannish accents, some songs might be in Dannish, so only 4 stars.Lots of goofing around, and the sound of beer bottles being opened during the songs makes for an environmental listen.They cover ""Radar Love"" by Golden Earing, and it sounds pretty sweet!"
5,Black Rose,"This is the real thing, live recordings, no apologies. If you're a serious King Diamond fan or if you enjoy Deep Purple type early 80's metal this one is for you. I haven't listened to anything besides this CD since I got it two weeks ago! An absolute must for any Diamond/Fate fan!"
4,Essential KD,"While not quite as good as Mercyful Fate or the solo King Diamond band, Black Rose proves fascinating even if the Great Dane wasn't on it. Well he is, and there is not one song here I truely dislike. King's voice is developing, and actually sounds a bit like it does on House of God or 9 because of less falsetto. This is not as shocking lyrically as Mercyful Fate or as over the top as King Diamond's solo band. Thus, it is fitting Black Rose is just that- the beginning of a brilliant career. I can enjoy this album mostly because it comes from King though, not the obscure Black Rose. Hilarious photos, killer music, killer package with liner notes- especially if you're quite the King Diamond fan I am, you can't miss this one. Hail The King, the real King- King Diamond!"
3,if you like deep purple,although the music sounds like deep purple on this release with king singing its a cool piece to add to your collection. there are a few cool tracks on here but i just love how its a rehearsal tape from that long ago that sounds as good as it does.
5,a very nice juicer,I would recommend this juicer to small familys because this does the job. But you need to have short glass in order to hold the juice as you are juicing.
2,"Noisy, not very powerful, and doesn't strain very well...","I have had this juicer for a number of years, and frankly there are much better choices out there.First, it's loud. Not something you want to use in the morning when there are still people sleeping. If you push down too hard while squeezing, it makes a MUCH louder annoying noise. (That's not hard to do) So it could use more power.Second, I don't like a lot of pulp in my juice. This doesn't filter it very well. I have to use a separate strainer.Third, the juice pours into a separate container you supply, and the spout is fairly low. SO if you making juice for several people you have to choose a small container to fill and keep pouring it into something else. (I tend to stack it on top of several thick cutting boards.Sometimes the spout also gets clogged easily with pulp, and you need to stop and clean it all out before continuing."
2,"Clogs easily, doesn't accommodate tall glasses","I recently purchased this Braun juicer. The motor is powerful and it does do a decent job extracting the juice. However, I have three problems with this product:1) The hole which allows juice to flow from the catcher down through the pouring spout is tiny. Thus, the hole is very easily clogged with seeds or pulp, forcing the user to disassemble the pieces and manually clear out the hole to allow the juice to flow. VERY ANNOYING!!2) The design does not accommodate tall glasses.3) When the adjustable spout is turned down to allow juice flow, the top of the juicer does not firmly fit onto the base. This causes the top to be unstable, rocking back and forth when a user applies downward pressure while juicing."
5,Fresh juice every morning,"I just tried the Citromatic for the first time this morning and I was very pleased with the results. The unit has a very stylish and compact design that fits nicely over any kitchen counter. Performance wise, this juicer has a strong motor that breezes through oranges really fast. The juice is slightly ""pulpy"" so if you don't like your juice with a little bit of pulp, look for another model. If you do, this juicer is a great choice."
4,The best yet,"I've owned a number of citrus juicers, and this is the best yet. Easy to use. Easy to clean. Easy to store and take out. A sturdy juicer that does its job and even looks nice. What else can you ask for? AND the price is right."
1,A Poor and biased History Lesson,"The overall idea of the book is excellent; that is, decisions of the past must be judged in the light of the times. We cannot judge past civilizations and their decisions by our standards. While the idea of how we should view history is excellent the execution of the concept in this book is horribly flawed. The author allows her bias to overflow into every passage. Nowhere is this retelling of history accomplished from a neutral point of view. This destroys the good premise behind the book. Anyone reading this book and agreeing with it will simply be agreeing with the liberal point of view of the author who adopts modern liberal western thought in reviewing the decisions of the past and condemns those who did not think like modern western liberals. The author fails to follow the basic premise of the book and thus destroys her credibility."
2,BrokeBack Hardback,"The book, March of Folly, is my second copy and one which I purchased to share with a friend who loves history.The book arrived in a timely manner and in good packaging. BUT when I opened the book, which wasadvertised as ""used"", I found that it had a broken spine which saddened me. I am in the process ofre-gluing the spine in the hopes that pages will not fall apart from binding. I would suggest thatsellers of used books describe flaws so that we the purchaser can make an educated decision topurchase or not."
3,It's ok.,"I bought this CD because I like the CD, It's Good To Be Alive.However, overall, I wasn't too impressed with the other 2 discs."
4,Excellent CD!,This cut shows some of the original reggae sounds and really can be played all the way through. I would highly suggest this cut to anyone looking for smooth reggae beats that never die! Big Up!
4,Not for everyone,"Akin has given Catholics just what many wanted, an easily-accessible source of liturgical norms. He uses the official Church documents and rubrics to explain the do's and don'ts of the Latin-rite liturgy. With many ""innovations"" and changes to the liturgy that we see today, this book helps wade through the opinions to get down to the official word and final say in the matter. This book isn't for everyone. It has one goal to tell you what should and shouldn't be done in the liturgy. It doesn't answer the ""why's"" or tell us where the problems came from. There are other books that do that well.A warning: Don't think that you are now the Liturgical Lone Ranger just because you have read this book. Too many pastors will continue to do their own thing regardless of the Church's rules - so be discerning in how you use it and keep praying."
5,Much better,"I read the reviews of this game and they were not good. But I gave it a try and I am very pleased with the results. I have the first game and it has a LOT of flaws. This game seems to have corrected almost all of them. Looking at it, the graphics are exactly the same as the first game. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. The first game's graphics were good for Playstation 1 standards. The biggest flaw the first game had was the gameplay which is completely corrected in this game. One thing I noticed with Mutant Academy 2 is the volume in the ending sequences. It seems to drop a bit for some reason. But the endings are much better in this one than in the previous version. And this game has secret characters such as Spider-man which is GREAT! Spider-man is a lot of fun to play. To play him just press L1 and select Cyclops to play. You'll automatically be Spider-man. I hope Mutant Academy 3 will be on Playstation 2. I was disappointed that this game wasn't."
3,A Fair Fighting Game,"This game is ultimately a good game...but has certain points in the game that I don't think it deserves to be given the remaining points that Dragonball Z Budokai stands. First off all the fighting is overall fun most of the time, and jumping around and whacking people all around the arena like a ping-pong ball can be made to your enjoyment. Plus the secret characters are pretty good, but nothing to dwadle about. First of all Psylocke isn't an overall great character, and the Juggernaut is pretty impressive but not really a fun character to play. Using cheat codes and getting characters which you activate by pressing buttons like Spider-Man and Professer X, but don't hope too much on this game. The aerial combat battles where you're litterally spinning around in the air is fun and if you gather the fun and you smack someone up into the air and jump up and deliver a projectile attack or whack him into the ground [Preferrably Forge] it can be made into a nice game."
5,x-citing game!,"this game is awesome!my farorite chacter in the game is spiderman. i also like beast,prosier x,magmeto,and sabertooth.i have rented this bame and i like it! i might even buy it!this game has really cool levels. some of the cool levels are like this spiderman vs toad, beast vs worvline,sabertooth vs storm,sabertooth vs jurrnaut,spiderman vs storm,clcops vs toad,and many more.they are going to make a x-men3 for ps2! this game is much better than tekken."
1,Special moves too hard,"Like so many fighting game, this game is ruined by the fact that doing the special moves is too hard. The instructions are pathetic. The standard method of doing special moves is hard, and these guys thought they'd try doing something different---making it even harder. Here's a clue for all you game developers--the cool thing about Xmen and all the other fighter in all the other games is the special moves--if it's too hard to do cool powers than the game is no fun. When is a developer going to get a clue on this?!?!? This game is a waste of time and money. Don't bother."
4,Great skillet but large for most stovetops,"This skillet is great. However, I would caution people that it's a little too big for most electric-coil burners, and so the outer ring of the skillet doesn't get hot and food won't cook right. My 12"" Lodge skillet gets much more stovetop use. This one mainly gets used for roasting meat in the oven. Of course if you have an especially large burner on your stove, then enjoy! I would also recommend buying the pre-seasoned skillet for the same price, if it's available to you; it's not hard to season a skillet, but it's nice to not have the trouble."
4,And what do I personally think?..........,"Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX 2 isn't the best game in the world. I would really give it a 3 1/2. The graphics are equal to that of THPS3. I found this game not as exciting or as fun as the Tony Hawk games or Shaun Palmer Pro Snowboarder. The boards aren't as big, either. I would recommend the Tony Hawk games and Shaun Palmers Pro Snowboarder over this game definitely, unless you are specifically looking for a BMX game. I would say either rent it or buy it cheap.....really cheap. In other words, I personally think it's definitely time they come out with a Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX 3."
2,Boring... z z Z Z...,"I don't really want to compare this to any other game, because I want this rating to be unbiased. If you want a bike sim, Matt Hoffman's Pro BMX may be for you... (I recommend renting it first.) The game is based on the Bus Tour theme, where you get a chance to ride in different cities around the U.S. I found it monotonous and boring after a couple of days playing it. Some stage goals are tedious, frustrating, but challenging. Your prize for goal completion is the ability to unlock other cities. And that's pretty much what the game can offer. Sound exciting??? If you ever do buy or rent this game, notice how bored the BMX riders look when they're in the garage. This might be a hint to what that game will be like."
3,OK,It's ok nothing special. Played it a couple times but nothing to rave about. Probably would not recommend to someone else
1,Don't buy it,"Really bad product. Perhaps the trick the engineer described in his review would have worked but never got the chance. Product would only dispense one or two bubbles after following instructions. Then, thinking perhaps the batteries were the problem, I replaced them and found that the bubble liquid was in the battery compartment. Cleaned that up and replaced batteries. No improvement. Fortunately, we got this as a gift so I only feel sorry that someone shelled out $25 for something this bad..."
1,"Gazillion bubbles Linkz gun...not a gazillion, just one.","Don't buy it. Really. My daughter loves bubbles, so we bought her this toy. It worked one time, and we haven't seen bubbles come out of it since. I'm writing the manufacturer to see what they will do about it (probably nothing). Save the money. We also have the bubble machine...it works great, so far!"
1,I only rated it with one star because they didn't OFFER a 0!,"This is fun in theory, only, the toy doesn't WORK!!!! First of all, the part that makes the bubbles is a wand inside the machine with a windshield wiper type thing on it so it makes a bubble. The problem with it is that it sticks, AND you have to keep slashing it back and forth.ALSO, the liquid got into the battery compartment RUINING my rechargable batteries!It claims to work with any bubble solution, but it doesn't.Don't waste your money on this one. It's a piece of junk."
1,"Good brand, Not a good product.","After visiting friends with a bubble gun I thought it was a great idea. This brand looked like they are the pros with that kind of thing and not being to expensive I bought it. The package says it creates ""linkz"" of bubbles. There were no such links from ours. The solution leaked into the battery compartment. It was just one little bubble popping the second it came out. I returned it. Definatly not worth the few bucks."
1,Quits working soon after first use,"My mom bought this toy for my son....it was great fun for all of us until about 30 minutes passed. It's almost as if the bubbles got into the battery pack or something because no matter what we did we couldn't get it to keep working. Yes, we did change the batteries--still nothing. Don't waste your money on this toy."
3,"Neat idea, not well executed","Simply doesn't work very well. The manner in which it attempts to 'spread' the bubble liquid across the 'wand' (think a windshield wiper dipping into the liquid and the dragging it across the plastic circle each time you pull the trigger) just isn't terribly reliable. Once you get it going, it can be quite fun. Unfortunately it took us, on average, half a dozen tries each time to get it to work. We returned it and got their bubble machine instead (much simpler premise: a windmill of wand circles dips into a well of bubble liquid and then rotates to the top where the fan blows through it); much less frustration and many, many more bubbles. Definitely a better choice for us."
1,Not good after all is gone from the first bottle,"When i first bought this for my 3 yr old daughter we both loved it. BUT when the first bottle emptied out and i refilled it, it didn't seem to work the bubbles were dragging out of the spout and when we released the gun the bubbles popped without leaving the gun.I figured it could only take Gazillioni bottles, so i went to buy another bottle and cleaned the gun and replaced with a new bottle BUT the bubbles still dragged and that was the end of it.I recommend to everyone not to buy this item. Just stick to the cheap 'blow it yourself' Gazillion Bubbles."
2,Encyclopedia of Applique,"I could hardly wait to receive the applique patterns - at last - patterns at my fingertips - needless to say, I was disappointed when I discovered that the book did not contain applique patterns but illustrations only. The pictures are not even illustrated properly so that they may be enlarged to use for patterns."
4,Garageband help,This book is for the serious garageband user. Loaded with detailed info. Abundant illustrations.
1,buen libro muy mal distribuidor,la biblia exelente pero el vendedor tarda por siempre para mandar el libro yo sugiero si van a comprar este libro busquen otro distribuidor
5,TREMENDOUS !!! Solid On ALL Fronts,"I have never written a book review before but I am extremely impressed by The Ultimate Windows Server 2003 System Administrator's Guide. It is written with authority yet very easy to understand. It begins with a forward by the Microsoft executive in charge of Windows ... that alone is a solid endorsement. However, the real proof came when I needed to understand otherwise foreign concepts like Active Directory and the various security technologies. The book gave me the theory and then provided very human instructions on how to pull these concepts together in the real world. I have six other Windows Server 2003 including the sub-standard Manasi book that has now become a door stop. The ""Ultimate ... Guide"" is always at my finger tips unless of course a co-worker borrows it."
2,Verbose filler,This book reads like a speech by a stuffed shirt: lots of words - very little actual content. There are numerous errors that show that this edition is a quick rehash of their 2000 edition (Windows 2000 listed where you would expect Windows 2003).
5,Another Great Book by Williams & Walla,"Like their previous work on Windows 2000 Server, the authors come closer to answering all the questions a SysAd has about Windows 2003 than any other I have ever seen. It provided in depth chapters, as well as example implementations in clear understandable language, and with an organizational structure that was easy to follow. A great book well worth the money!"
5,Microsoft Sr VP Endorses It ... So Do I !,"When the Microsoft Senior Vice President of the Windows Division writes glowing reviews about a book and its authors, I take notice. Brian's Valentine's foreward to this book reflects my impressions ... a book that places Windows Server 2003 architecture and administrative issues in perspective andthen drills down to the internals. Microsoft's top Windows Server 2003 executive wrote a great review of the ""Ultimate Windows Server 2003 Sys Admin Guide"" instead of writing about competitive books from Microsoft Press ... and I believe he correctly selected this book as the best of breed.I am impressed with the clear way the authors present a straight forward theoretical view of major features and then go directly into real world utilization issues. Here is a book that educates and provides solid guidance for administration."
3,Not for someone looking for a book that teaches you,All topics are too general. It is not detailed at all. This book is not for someone that needs to learn about Windows 2003 server. It was written as a form of review for someone that has knowledge on the subjects listed. It is just a reference book.
2,Three Brief Essays,"This little monograph consists of three brief essays:The Development of the English Watercolor by Evelyn J. PhimisterThe Picturesque Landscape by Stephanie WilesTurner, Girtin, and the Rise of Romanticism by Cara D. DenisonThere are several nice drawings and watercolors. Two dollars is about what it's worth."
1,Colorado Atlas,Very poor details compared to the Colorado Road and Recreation Atlas. Do not even use it.
1,"Colorado Atlas and Gazetteer, has POOR detail...!","This does not show many of the back roads (un-improved...), and is not very topographic (mountains...). VERY CONFUSING to try and follow!I ""HIGHLY"" recommend the!-Benchmark Colorado Road & Recreation Atlas (any state!) Excellent detail/topographic, and most of the trails...!Benchmark Colorado Road & Recreation Atlas"
5,An excellent aid for the statistically-anxious student,"This book is for all students who suffer any sort of statistics-anxiety and yet must take a statistics course in high school or college. Of course, it would also be of value for anyone simply interested in statistics. As college students well know, most statistics texts are typically impossible to make sense of. This book explains quite complex concepts and analyses in ways that professors are often unable to do. The examples are clean and crisp. Difficult material is brought down to earth with prose that is both user-friendly and often humorous. Well worth purchasing."
5,Wonderful!!,I bought this crock pot as a replacement for a 4 qt crock that was centuries old. Clean up is a BREEZE! Being able to remove the pot to soak is wonderful. The exterior stays cool to the touch. What more could one ask for?
3,Dissapointed,"We used this crock pot fot the first time yesterday. We cooked a 3 pound chuck shoulder pot roast with carrots, onions and potatoes FOLLOWING EXACTLY THE RECIPE THAT CAME WITH THE INSTRUCTION BOOKLET. It said to slice the potatoes THIN which is a must because after 9 hours cooking on low, they were STILL not done! We sliced the spuds 1/8 inch thick! The carrots, onion and beef were ok. The beef was slightly overdone. I found the pot to cook unevenly. Since you only add 1 cup of liquid, it is not enough to cover everything, so some things cook faster than others. Next time we will try cooking on high and see if it improves."
1,Spinal relief pillo,This is a poor design as the velcro strap is very rough and this alone accounts for irritation during sleep. It doesn't fit snug enough - keeps slipping around the leg and the foam is a bit too stiff for comfort. I ended up strapping it to the foot of my lazy-boy chair to help rise the legs up a bit but what a waste of money to buy this.
2,Not as good as advertised.,"In theory, this is a good idea but, in reality, it's a waste of $40. It doesn't stay on unless you strap it so tight it cuts off your circulation. If it were in two pieces it might be more functional."
1,Don't Bother Reading This!!!!!!,"I found this book to be boring from the minute I began reading it. The entire idea behind it was one-sided, and it was very hard to follow. What should have taken him about 150 pages to describe, it took twice as much. In conclusion, I found that this book really shed no light on what I already knew before. Thanks a lot Cecil Roth!!!!"
2,Be careful,"I just say: ""be careful"". This is an interesting book, but rather because it gives an idea about what in the Thirties Spanish Inquisition was supposed to have been, than for the real light it casts on historical reality. Those more interested in historical facts than in romance about history ought rather prefer more updated and accurate studies, such as i.e. Kamen's ""Spanish Inquisition"", indeeed a report of a lifelong struggle for truth."
2,Provides an overly selective history of the Inquisition.,"I bought this book looking for a good overview of the return of the Church to Spain. What I found was an attack on the Catholic Church claiming anti-Semetism. While I'm sure this was part of what was going on, I am looking for an overview of political and social tensions in the region which ended up being the scene of many trials and ""conversions."" By completely overlooking other religions (especially the expulsion of the Muslems)and persecutions thereof, this book is heavily biased and reeks of revisionist tendencies."
3,Good Value Cast Iron,"This is the first piece of cast iron cookware I've ever owned. I give a 3 1/2 stars since it has been used only a few times.Here are the reasons why I like this cast iron griddle:1) it is a good value;2) it heats up very fast even on an electric stove;3) It is versatile--can be used in the oven.Here are the reasons why I don't like the griddle:1) The handle is way too short; Lodge needs to redesign the handle by adding another 3 inches. I wouldn't mind paying extra $$ for one with a better handle out there.2) It is slightly discolored although it has been used only three times to cook crepes, pancake and salmon.Maybe Lodge will take heed of all their customers' input and improve its products soon."
1,Totally disappointed,"I bought this griddle after reading reviews from people that its good for Indian cooking. I seasoned it as per instructions.I am totally disappointed.. my Indian flatbread/chapattis turn very hard after roasting on it, forget making dosas or omlettes..I wish I could return it to the manufacturer and get my money back."
2,OK but...,"It is all right where cast iron products are concerned. The only disadvantage is that as it is in original finish, we need to heat it in the oven. My oven is so small. It can't fit. So, I cannot use it yet. In future, I will only buy seasoned cast iron products. I like Lodge products though."
3,Get the seasoned pan instead,"I own a 12"" seasoned skillet from Lodge Logic so after reading reviews here, I decided to get the unseasoned griddle. I seasoned it according to the instructions but when I put in on the burner ( I have an electric stove) almost immediately the center of the pan burnt. I was very disappointed and called up Lodge asking to return the griddle.They instead offered to replace the griddle with the seasoned version and I am so happy now! Lodge really stands behind their products and I will not hesistate to buy their products ever. I will however opt for the seasoned items instead of seasoning myself at home."
4,a great little griddle,"This is my first piece of cast iron cookware, and I'm very happy with it. I've been using it for crepes, and they come out beautifully even. Once it's seasoned, you only need a touch of oil when cooking to maintain the non stick surface. The handle is a bit short, though, so you need an oven mitt to move the pan when it's hot."
4,Works like a dream,"I first saw this griddle at a friend's house. We used it to make crepes, and the results were absolutely perfect. Subsequently I've been using mine to grill panini, brown chicken breasts until golden, slowly sizzle perfect salmon filets, and turn out beautifully done steaks and chops. It even works well in the oven to finish cooking a beef or pork tenderloin. Note, I am a serious cast-iron cookware devotee, and I like utensils and tools that are multi-taskers. This griddle fits that bill and stays busy on my stove. Perfect for one person or a couple."
2,Disappointed in Pick up Sticks,"The color on the pick up sticks is so light you can not even tell what color each one is or if there is a difference in the colors of the sticks. I bought them to use in counseling sessions and I am so disappointed. I expected them to be clearly marked in different colors. I would have chosen another brand, had I known."
3,The Great Rat Island Adventure,"This wasn't my favorite book in the world, but towards the end it was better. It's about this boy that was like realy fat when he lived with his mom and ate food all the time. He was lazy and he was into Star Trek, Star Wars, and other science fiction stuff. He was supposed to spend the summer with his dad and his dad didn't want him on the island because he wasn't going to be able to eat and sleep whenever he pleased. After he arrived he was with his dad, 2 college boys, and a girl that admired his dad for everything he was worth, which wasn't very much in Joel's eyes. The he discovered a girl living on the neighboring island, befriended her, and even rescued her dog from Owen's Island for her. Several days later the girl was in trouble and Joel came to her rescue the end"
1,Disapointment,"I had the same product for almost 4 years and it worked fine, but it developed a leak.The new one won't turn on and I returned it."
1,Leaky mess,"After a couple of months, the Braun kettle developed a slow leak.If water is left in the kettle overnight, by morning there's a big puddle on the countertop."
2,"Worked great, but the water tasted metallic","This product heated water incredibly fast, and the auto shut-off feature was very handy. However, after several uses the water developed a funny metallic taste and smell that progressively worsened with continued use."
5,I love this teakettle,"This teakettle has everything. It's attractive, it saves energy, and unlike ordinary teakettles, has a window that shows how much water is in it and shuts off automatically, so it never boils over. The reviewer who commented that it's hard to fill must not have read the instructions. It can be filled easily through the spout, so the lid doesn't have to be raised for filling."
5,Works great,"We were first introduced to the electric kettle while motoring around New Zealand last year for 6 weeks. Every hotel and guest house we stayed ay had one and it was so convenient we bought this Braun here in America.Love it, boiling water in a couple of minutes."
5,Great price and service,"I am very happy with the Braun Electric Water Kettle. We had a Phillips model for about 10 years, which we thought would last forever. It didn't, and now I am sure the Braun will be much longer-lived. And after pricing this particular kettle on many sites, I found Amazon cut the price in half, and the shipping was reasonable and efficient. Thank you for your service."
2,Noisy and started leaking after a couple of years,Makes loud noise on granite counter and started leaking from the bottom after 2 years of use. I am not sure if i buy the same again. Disappointing for Braun.
2,Died after 1 year and two days,"While it worked it was great, but one morning I got up to turn it on and nothing happened. Contacted Braun but never received a reply. The kettle was cleaned regularly with vinegar and not misused."
2,Nice while it lasted....,For the first year and a half this kettle performed beautifully. It heats very fast and is very user friendly. It is now being thrown out... namely it switches off electrically before the water is boiled and without triping the switch.For the ...price I expected something to last a bit longer.I'm buying the Hamilton Beach model here on Amazon to replace it.
3,Black Friday Pricing,"the black Friday promotion for this item said: Today only, get the Braun Aqua Express for the Thanksgiving-Day-only price of $25.00. However, when I put it in the shopping cart it shows $48. How do you get the $25 price?"
1,Fake price for the product,I orded it and it never get to me. Waiting 3 weeks now. Just claimed that they might ship. Now they increased the price for it. I guess they never had this product for that price and all is fake. In total Amazon drops the old reliability that they had before. Customer support sucks. They do not read the email nor providing and supervisor contacts. :-(
5,Works like it's s'posed to,"I purchased this kettle about a month and a half ago, and from the time I unpacked it it's seen heavy, daily use by both me and my roommate. We are both caffeine junkies, so the fact that it boils water fast is cool. We are also both pretty spacy, so the fact that it turns itself off is also cool. I'm trying to think of gripes I have with the thing, but it actually works really well. If you need an electric doodad to heat up water, this will do it for you."
4,electric water kettle,"This kettle is great, easy to use, safe. Before the purchase I read the description and it is what I expected, no disappointing surprises. The price is right. I find the electrical cord too short, could be for safety reasons."
1,You taste the plastic in yuor tee.,"I bought this ketttle a long time ago and waited to get some positive results, but no.Here is the problem, if you are a tee drinker you don't want to taste or smell anything else but the tee. This kettle has has very strog oder of plastic comming from lid and it gets worse with higher temperature. Now when you boil you have to keep the lid closed (electromechnical interlock). The steam condensate, it drips back and gives the water a real nasty taste.I think the black version uses different material (I don't know) but I am getting a stainlees steel version."
3,Great at first... but...,"I bought this over a year ago and have loved it... using it almost daily to make tea. Sadly, after about 14 months of use it started leaking heavily out of the bottom! I looked and looked it over for a way to fix it but to no avail. Another addition to our throw away society.I loved the pot and might even consider buying another... but??"
5,Fabulous,"The Braun WK200W Aqua Express Electric Water Kettle is absolutely great. We have had 2 corded electric tea kettles and they don't even compare to this one. The cords used to always get in the way. With the Braun you have a corded base that the kettle sits on, but the pot lifts off of that free of any cords. It heats the water fast, is a little louder than our other two, but it is also more powerful. It has almost double the water capacity of other kettles and it is more portable. It can be taken away from the base to another counter if you need hot water for a recipe. We would highly recommend it, especially if you are a tea drinker."
3,electric tea kettle,"Product visibly looks good outside, but there was still a metal base inside the unit;opening was relatively small making it difficult to clean.Appearance of unit did not exude quality; electric cord while short for safety reasons seemed oversized for the unit, and somewhat inflexible.Similar product(s) sold in Asia, are of better quality and construction.I'll continue to use the old style all glass Pyrex unit to boil water for tea."
3,The boiled water tastes funny,"I bought this kettle after spending a month in Europe and enjoying the quick tea/coffee making with an electric kettle there. This product didn't really satisfy my expectations. It's a little loud and slower than I wanted. But the main problem is that the water tastes funny. It has a metallic/plastic taste. It's okay for the tea I made but the coffee my husband made with this water really tastes awful.I am still giving it 3 stars because I like the look of it and how it works, for the most part."
5,Great kettle,"I just need a kettle that is easy to use, boils water fast, and is reliable. My last kettle, the Melitta 1.7 liter Express Kettle, seemed fine but after only a couple of months the auto shut off feature stopped working. As a result we had a kitchen filled with steam on several occasions. A few months later and it started leaking somehow, so it was time for a new kettle. The Braun WK200W does what is should and boils water fast."
4,great electric kettle,"After getting this & using it, I cannot believe how much money & time I've wasted with ordinary kettles. This model is great because it lives up to its claims--it really does boil up to 7 cups of water in a matter of minutes, it has convenient view windows on both sides to see how much water you have in the kettle, it's lightweight & easy to carry & pour, & it has an automatic shut-off function. Granted, this is the only electric kettle I've owned so far, but I've seen & held other brands/models, & I think this one was the best choice for me."
4,Very convenient,"The greatest plus for this applicance is convenience with a capital ""C"". There are only two negatives I see so far: The limited range of motion on the lid makes it harder to fill than typical tea pots. Secondly, I have noticed calcium deposits in the bottom of the pot which mean that it needs cleaning only after a few weeks of use. This has more to do with our bad water than the pot itself. I would definitely buy another one."
2,Two of these with same problem,"I've had two of these, one which I purchased and a replacement I inherited from my mother. After a year, they both started to leak from the base."
2,Inside metal peeling off,"I was very happy with this product when I bought it. It still works fine. However, the metal coating on the inside (what's in contact with the water) has been peeling off. I'm very concerned to be drinking these metal particles, so I'm in the hunt for a new one. I will have to throw this one away :("
3,Worked great - for 2 years,Bought this electric tea kettle in January of 2008 and it worked great until the end of 2009. The light that shows it is heating started blinking and within a month the tea kettle stopped working altogether. It did a great job but should have lasted longer than that.
5,super had it for 10 years,"I had and still have this tea kettle since my wedding.Love never had any problems with it. I cleaned it with vinegar every once in a while. Never had a problem with it smelling bad. And I use it a lot. I bought it for all my friends, my mom has 2 of them ""for large parties"". I am very sad to say, I need to buy one for my mother in-law(since her cheap one broke) And I Cannot Find One Anywhere even on the Braum web site. :("
4,good kettle,"It's perfect except it's made of plastic!. I love it very much . I bought two. The older one is 3 years old . It's my favorite. Because I don't like plastic , I tried to used other kind of kettles to replace them again and again . But after Ia while, I used them again. I still can't find other kettle better than Braun. I hope they will have a better kettle not made of plastic. I love my Braun. The water tastes best"
3,"When it works, it's great!","I've had two of these Braun electric kettles. I loved the first one, which lasted a good few years, but I got a little too exuberant when cleaning it and broke the hinge on the lid. I purchased a second one and determined to be more careful. It seemed no time before I noticed puddles of water forming around the base and rather than chance electrocution for a cup of tea, I tossed the kettle in the bin. I am now in the market for a new kettle, and as much as I like the design and the function of Braun kettle I doubt I will purchase another one."
5,Accesories? where to buy spout filters?,"Love the item, think it's fast, neat. Anyone know where to purhcase the spout filters?Thanks,BL"
3,"efficient, good design","This kettle works quickly and quietly. The automatic shut-off feature is a great thing. Two drawbacks: an unpleasant plastic-y smell after you pour out all the boiling water (I hope this smell will dissipate in time; it is getting less intense the more I use the kettle); the lid doesn't open far enough, making filling it a little more difficult than it should be. Hence three stars."
2,"Great kettle, Weak switch design","I have owned 2 kettles in the past 4 years. The unit worked absolutely great for several months then I noticed the switch would pop-up and stop the kettle after about 10 seconds. So, I would have to hold the switch down for about 15 to 20 seconds then the unit would continue on its own to reach boiling as normal. After about a year or two the switch failed completely. Both kettles failed exactly the same way. I won't buy another one!"
3,Best of All,"This is the best tea kettle of all. (I've tried lots.) Costs a bit more than others, but it shuts itself off without fail when the water boils. And it can be poured free of the stand and cord. A class product."
5,FAST way to drink tea!!,"A few years ago we switched from coffee to tea. This is an ULTRA fast way to make hot water for tea, oatmeal, or any reason to have VERY hot water. It takes only about 3 minutes for a large cup of water."
5,Outstanding Product!,"I first used this product at a Tai Chi workshop in Florida. Boiled water for tea in a snap! Instead of having to fill the teapot, put it on the stove, wait for the water to boil (average 5 minutes or more) and many times get bored waiting around...this pot fills easily through the spout (recommended because the water passes through the filter that way), a click of the button on the handle and in about a minute you have boiling water for hot chocolate, soup, recipes...! I love my Braun water kettle...and highly recommend it to all."
5,No one should be without one of these,"Exiled here in the US (out of our own choice) we lamented that fact that people boiled water in a saucepan! What is a kettle? our American friends would say! Target was the first place we saw a Phillips kettle and then they just seemed to disappear. Amazon to the rescue and a Braun at that! The price can shoot up to $69.99 sometimes, but I've been lucky enough to get them when they've been at $29.99. That's when I get 2. The wonderful thing is that you pay no tax and no shipping, and if you have Prime then you get them in 2 days max. So if you don't have one of these, try it; you'll never boil water in a saucepan again :)"
5,Great kettle,"I really love this kettle. It boils the water fast and you can lift the whole pot off the base and replace it any way. The cord is wrapped up on the bottom, you have to unravel it. At first, I thought the cord was too short but then I saw you had to unravel it."
5,My favorite appliance in the kitchen,This is my favorite appliance in my kitchen. We bought this after reading many many reviews and it really is a great electric kettle. The water boils almost instantly and I use it almost everyday even when I'm just boiling water for pasta because it works a lot quicker then boiling water in a pot on my stove. I just turn on the heat on my stove and boil my water in the kettle and then pour boiling water in my hot pot and it works great!!!
3,Built in obsolescence,"The kettle looked good, did its job and worked well (5-6 times a day) altho a little noisy. It started to fail soon after its second birthday when it would boil for longer and longer periods and eventually the on off button failed altogether (came off in my hand...)"
1,I dislike this electric kettle,"My electric kettle keeps clicking off every time I try to use it. I have previously used an Oster, and found it nearly flawless. I would try another brand over this one."
2,If you are concerned about hot water in plastic...,"Admittedly, I've never bought an electric tea kettle before, but I'm sending this one back without having used it. I had no idea from the description of the product that the hot water would be sitting in PLASTIC. That is, the kettle is plastic on the inside as well as the outside. Just thought I'd add a bit of information that would have influenced my decision had I read it in a review (or in the description of the product)."
1,The ultimate in electric tea kettles,"I was given one of these Braun electric water kettles as a gift at Christmas and just love it. Everytime I use it with company, they all say they want one also. It is pleasing to the eye as well as very fast heating. My daughter who is a mother of 2 boys asked for it for her birthday. I ordered this one from Amazon as I could not find them in the local stores. She is very happy with it. I am thinking of who I might get one as a gift this year."
5,Braun WK200W Electric Water Kettle evaluation,Braun WK200W Electric Water Kettle works very well. Excellent appliance. Would buy it again.
1,I bought this Kettle on the recommendations of others,"After a week of use, this Kettle would NOT SHUT OFF when it reached boiling what a disappointment, back to the old kettle... Braun/Amazon check your stuffbefore selling to your customer baseDisappointedScot"
2,Death of a Kettle,"I purchased this item last December and haven't quite owned it a year. It has recently died on me after a few days of odd, hot smells emanating from the kettle after use. It did heat water rapidly, it was easy and convenient, and now it's dead. My last purchased kettle (Proctor-Silex 5+ years old) is still going strong elsewhere. I am very disappointed."
2,Breaks eventually,"Pros: Is light, works.Cons: We have gone through two of these kettles. In both cases, the on button broke. I opened it up, and can see where the plastic hinge has broken. I might get around to attempting to repair them, but don't recommend it to others.We then bought the silver Braun WK-600. It leaks (although turning it upside down for a while stops the leak for a week or two).I recommend the Capresso H2O-- it worked well until someone dropped it and it shattered, but the workmanship can't be blamed for that."
3,Very average piece of appliance,This kettle is far from my expectations. It takes too much time to boil water and the ergonomics is not that great: the lid opens in a very inconvenient way so you'd have a problem filling the kettle up with water.
2,Leaking problem,The same problem many other customers reported: after a few months of use the kettle began leaking - not just a few drops but puddles of water. That is a shame because I liked the kettle before that problem developed. I am throwing it out. I would recommend this kettle only to those who don't mind disposable things.
5,The best looking water kettle on the market.!,"The first electric water kettle I owned was a Black and Decker and it died after 6 months. Since than I've owned a Krups, toastmaster, Kenwood, Russell Hobbs, and Philips and two Braun tea kettles(I liked the Braun so much I had to buy a second). Not only is the Braun the most beautiful but it and the Philips are the most functional of the groups and I use them several times a day. The Braun unit I have been using for about the last 4 years and it has never failed me and is still going strong. I look to many more years from this great appliance."
5,Exactly right,"This is exactly what I wanted -- an easy-to-use, intelligently designed electric kettle. It boils water with impressive speed, is easy to move around, and the automatic shut-off feature is great. I use it almost every day."
5,"Great design, use filtered water for longevity",My friend introduced me to this kettle on a trip to the UK. It's the kind of design that's simple and perfectly functional. My only criticism is that the flip up lid is a little small for filling and doesn't not flip out 180 degrees but this is a niggling point. I highly recommend this kettle to any tea drinkers. Be sure to use filtered water to minimize deposits.
5,We love that water kettle,This tea kettle was sorely missed as our first one gave out after at least 8years of multiple daily use. We love its efficency and easy handling.
4,Amazingly convenient,"Great product to have in office for tea drinkers,It boils water in no time and with the inbuilt sensor, turns off as the boiling temperature is reached. A no hassle, well designed must have office supplies"
2,Problem with auto shutoff after 10 months.,"Most people say lot of good things about this kettle,I agree with them.However, mine now takes a longer time for auto shutoffto kick in. I've removed the Ca build up with no avail.Now I am shopping for another one."
5,Just About Perfect,"We got this as a summer substitute for the Zojirushi hot pot that keeps boiling water always available, because our airconditioner didn't appreciate the constant heat (although we continue to love the Zojirushi ""in season""). The Braun is perfect. A full pot of 7 cups boils in 5 minutes and then shuts off. It's light, not ugly, and has a red light indicator on 2 sides. Best of all, the platter is perfectly designed, so that you don't have to orient the pot one way or another when you sit it down. The whole thing pretty much stays out of your way; even the cord length is adjustable. Perhaps the only thing missing is a bell or ring-tone that tells you when it's done. Small detail."
4,Braun electric water kettle,"I really like this kettle and give it four stars instead of five because I haven't owned it long enough to know if it will last the four or five years that I expect from such a product. It is reliable, fast, good-looking and very comfortable to hold and use. It shuts off automatically so one doesn't have to stand and watch it, but water stays hot in it for a convenient length of time or reheats easily if one is called away.My former housemate had one which we shared for a year and when he moved out I looked around for a replacement. Not finding anything I liked as well I ordered another Braun."
2,very loud,"I was surprised to find out how loud this unit was. Before it comes to a full boil, it makes a very loud and high pitched whine that I found very annoying. I returned it after one week."
3,Arrived much too late; wrong color,"This item arrived much too late and was the wrong color (black, even though I had clearly specified white).However the company has shown good faith by offering to refund the money which was charged to my credit card."
4,Almost perfect,"This kettle is great! It heats water up very quickly and is very convenient. My one complaint is that the water cools off faster than I would like, but we just had to get used to using it faster. I would recommend it and would buy it again."
3,Not so good after a while,"If you use this kettle be sure to drain all the water out when it's done, if the water sits in the kettle for a while, soon you will notice that the material coating at the bottom (interior) of the kettle starts flaking off.I would say i love it at first, but when the flaking occurs, i stopped using it 'cause i don't want to be drinking whatever that coating is."
5,Kettle,"I like the kettle, works well, however the colors were not the same as on the pic. The buttons and the screen are blue... not the way I imagined it based on the pic. Otherwise I am happy with it. Thank you."
4,"3 years of great and then the ""leak"".","I have had this kettle for 3 years, and have been very happy with it. I have used it daily until it started to leak. If water is left in the kettle overnight there is a puddle on the counter in the morning. I am still using it, but leave it empty until morning. I am actually thinking about getting another one, since it has been fine until the leak began."
5,Repeat Customer,I needed a hot water Kettle two years ago. I bought this one and LOVED it. I especially like how quickly it heats up and that it has an automatic shut off if I wander out of the kitchen. The only reason that I need a new one is that I took the other one to work.
2,Unit will discolor and stain,I had a Braun white plastic electric water kettle for many years. I won't buy another plastic water kettle. It gets very discolored on the inside and yellows on the outside over time. It was great when new but became an embarrassment over the years. They haven't come up with a way to keep white plastic from yellowing. The inside was more disgusting. It was washed and only had the very clean Oregon tap water or filtered water in it. Think twice about the longevity of buying a white plastic water kettle.
5,Great item. Reliable and Durable.,"I bought this item as a replacement for one we had in the office that had gotten damaged (melted) by fire. It got used almost daily, 2-3 times a day for many months. It's easy to use and quick to heat. Its style also makes it easy to pour. We have another model and its design makes it difficult to pour. It is a little more costly than some other models, but is a very good quality product, and is still priced lower than many other models. It's hard to find in stores and I could only find it online. After looking at many online vendors, I can tell you that Amazon has the best price for this item. For the cost and the quality, I highly recommend this item."
5,This is a great product for tea drinkers.,This is actually my third Braun electric kettle. I bought an identical one for my mom last year. We have been using ours at home for a couple of years with no problems. I bought this one for my workplace.
3,Not a fast boiler,"this may seem a fast boiler compared to the microwave or stove, but it's relatively slow compared to kettles you can get in the UK. It's only 1.5kw, so compared to say a Morphy Richards 3.1Kw kettle, it's only half as fast as that. 3kw kettle seem hard to come by in the US though...my search continues."
4,Convenient and quick,"I bought the water kettle for the guest coffee/tea bar of our bed and breakfast inn. It works just as advertised - it will heat two cups boiling hot in less than 2 minutes, a full 7 cups in less than 5 min, and it will shut itself off once it reaches a full boil. It is more convenient than keeping a hot water carafe full, and it is faster than heating a traditional kettle on the burner. It did have a new-plastic smell to the water for the first few times, but then that went away. The plastic construction is less hot to the touch on the outside, and the handle stays relatively cool, so the risk of burn injury is less than an all metal construction. All in all, I am very satisfied with the product and I feel it was reasonably priced. I would buy another. I only wish it were an even higher watt so it would heat even faster."
2,Low quality,"Died in 6 months. Called customer support, they told me that they do not provide replacement since it is discontinued model, and I have to send it to nearest service center at my own shipping expense. Will never buy this one again."
3,Streabbog was stuck in a rut.,"Out of all the musical forms he could have chosen, Streabbog wrote 10 of the pieces in this book are in the ternary form and 2 of the pieces in the five-part form. All of the melodies are in four-measure blocks, and there is almost no counterpoint. Variety of harmony is also lacking. Pungent dissonances such as diminished sevenths and augmented sixths are non-existent.Burgmuller and Clementi win by a wide margin."
2,cute but beware...,"I loved this when I got it out of the box but it hasn't quite lived up to my expectations. First, I left it sitting on my brand new changing table for several days while painting the nursery. I hadn't peeled off the double sided tape so didn't think it would be a problem. Evidently it got too warm and stuck to the table so when I peeled it off it ruined the finish. I admit to possible ""user error"" but didn't want anyone else to make the same mistake!The other issue is that it fell off the wall about 2 weeks after hanging it up. The mechanism for adhering it to the wall isn't sufficient, but I'm sure you could add more tape or nails to keep it in place."
3,They don't glow,"They look very cute up on the wall and go up easily and I've had no problem with them sticking BUT, they DO NOT GLOW IN THE DARK. I exposed mine outside to full sunny daylight for at least 5 hours thinking they weren't getting enough light inside..it didn't matter, they do NOT glow. That was disappointing!"
5,"Regis is out, Anne is in!!","Regis is out, Anne Robinson is in! I have every Game Show home game that they have made for the Playstation Game Console. I say this one BLOWS away the others! The graphics are great, the gameplay is great, heck even Anne is great in this game!If you're a fan of The Weakest Link TV show, or you're looking for a good party game, then I would suggest this game is WELL worth the $30.00 bucks!"
2,Poor Sound Quality,"The sound quality is very poor. At parts one can hear a loud hissing sound, at other parts the volume either increases or decreases. The hypnotic suggestions could have been more effective. I found the people walking on the beach at sunrise distracting."
4,Suck it up and Deal,"First heard Deal when Napster (when it was nascent and a good place to ""shop"") had this album as one of it's feature discs. For some reason I only downloaded the salute to Stevie Ray Vaughan and the disc faded from memory. Well, 10 years later I decided I wanted to revisit it so I bought it. Really glad I did. The songs still are top notch and worth many repeated spins. I passionately like the afore referrenced ""The Day the Blues Cried"" and ""My Father's Redneck"". But there's not a bad song on this disc.Nothing on here is a pop cop out. It's good solid country in the Toby Keith & Hank Jr. vein."
1,Waste of money!,"Ruthless Execution is a simplistic view of leadership 101 topics. If your company needs this to break through the wall, you have much deeper problems. It seems that Mr Hartman is trying to write to the uneducated or non-professional. Don't waste your money!"
5,Good Read but like the Rings movie does not end.,This book covers along time period in which the author travels to many exotic and interesting places (ok I am a little jealous). While I am not convinced that the Ethiopians have the original AOC I do not dismiss that they could and Mr.. Hancock puts some convincing evidence to support that. I enjoy his style of writing as a narrative about his adventures rather than just a fact based book.
2,Disappointed in preconceived conclusion,"Mr. Hancock does an excellent job providing historic and cultural information on Ethiopia - a country that is typically only known for its periodic famines and political upheaval. I couldn't help but be disappointed in the method he used to present his hypothesis. That is, he begins the book with a full explanation of the arch's location. The remainder of the book goes on to justify why he thinks this is true. As I read each chapter, I kept waiting for some intriguing plot twist or new revelation, but these never came. It was like reading a ""whodunit"" novel and discovering the killer's identity in the first chapter. I've read a few other books in this genre (""Holy Blood/Holy Grail"" for example) that were truly suspenseful even if you totally disagree with the findings. Hancock's informaiton on Ethiopia does have some value, especially for those who are interested in ancient history."
3,"I'm so glad I read this book, but...","but without ruining the ending (which some here have done) don't expect the excitement of anyone's head exploding and Nazi's to burst into flames. Heck don't expect the excitement of watching grass grow.The subject matter is fascinating. And some of the research is remarkable. The researcher finds ""clues"" in a cathedral, and at a grave site, and pieces together info from biblical text. Great stuff!!!! But holy cow, 600 pages!?!?! ( I thought it was more, it felt like more).Read this if you are REALLY interested in archaeology and the Bible and the Ark. But if you are looking for a good adventure, not here my friends.Again I felt smarter for reading this (maybe that was because it is a 600 pg book, I'd neverread that much before) and that made this a satisfying purchase, but I would never tell anyone they have got to read this."
4,Intriguing and Convincing,"I found this to be a fascinating read, with plenty of adventure. I just wish that we could prove or disprove his ultimate conclusion. If this subject is your cup of tea, you will not be disappointed."
3,An interesting book that ends up on a strange path,"Mr. Hancock's novel was very interesting and was hard to put down for more than 5 minutes at a time. I found myself reading his book during every free moment of my day. The book was intriguing and I believed all of the conclusions Mr. Hancock was making.....until I got to the second half of the book. Mr. Hancock started to lose credibility with me when he tried to tie Moses, the Ark, and Atlantis together. It seemed that he was mixing biblical and historical facts with his own personal beliefs to create unbelievable answers to questions his research posed. I was disappointed with the conclusions he reached but I found the majority of his research interesting and would recommend this book for fans of history and mystery but not for those unwilling to open their minds to unconventional religious thinking."
3,Extraordinarily interesting yet technically flawed,"Very good writing. The history contained in the book is very interesting, especially if you are interested in esoteric societies and the like. However, Hancock's conclusions were often poorly thought out and based on highly circumstantial evidence."
3,Compelling but not convincing,"I really enjoyed this book as a speculative adventure piece. I learned a bit about the history of the Ark, the Grail, the Templars, and the Ethopian Jews.In the end, I had to take his conclusions with more than a grain (a pillar perhaps?) of salt. He leaves holes big enough to drive an ark through... and that would be Noah's, not the Ark of the Covenant.Read it with a healthy dose of skepticism and enjoy a quasi-historic tourbus ride come detective novel."
3,Interesting but far-fetched work,"Graham Hancock takes readers on a fantastic journey through the depths of time. His theory on the location of the Ark is plausible, but a lot of his explanations are not. Particularly bad is his theory that moses built the Ark using science from a lost Atlantean civilization.On the other hand he does an excellent job of portraing life in Ethiopia and the practices of Ethiopian religious groups. This would be very interesting for the comparative religion student.In short, Mr. Hancock asks some interesting and provactive questions, and answers them in a somewhat compelling way, but gets way too farfetched at times."
5,INTO THE ARK,"Let us remember that the Ark of Noah was the ORIGINAL ARK,That the Ark of the Covenant,The Keeper of All Soul-Contracts,Is only the Copy of the 5 and 5 Commandments,Which Moses broke before writing again.And that this Ark had preserved the Priethood of AARon.Let Us remember the Priesthood of Melchizedek and Noah's Ark.Nevertheless, an interesting quest for Graham Hancock,A valueable tale and a gift for our kin."
3,an entertaining story at best,"An interesting narrative of Hancock's search for the Ark of the Covenant. His account of events is both entertaining and informative, even though it is at times highly questionable and sloppy. At best, it is a good read for both the secular and religious minded. By the way, the Ark is buried under the Temple Mount."
4,A good read and at first site excellent research but....,"I read this book 4 years ago while living in Southern France and enjoyed it very much. I admire the amount time and research that goes into writing a book of this kind. Question..... during the reasearch into the history of the Ark did Mr. Hancock read a book called ""The Lost Books of the Bible""? A chapter in this book clearly describes the Ark as being in the Temple when Mary (the mother of Jesus)was a young girl. These books ,some believe, were available to pilgrims who visited the Holy Land prior to the crusades. It would certainly help to explain why the Templars excavated so extensively around and under the Temple Mount!"
1,WOW!,"This one is a hard read! I tried to commit as much time to reading and understanding this book as possible. Aside from the constant George Bush bashing, it may be an okay book. If I knew then what I know now, I wouldn't have wasted my time."
2,Wrong story,"This is not the story I thought it was, and I didn't like the plot. It is not my genre of books."
3,Not user friendly,"I have upgraded from the Printshop 6 because of compatiblity problems when I upgraded my comp and figured I would go for the Newest version of Printshop. It seems to have many more new features but it takes time to figure out how to use each application in the program. I have had this program for about a month, It shouldn't have taken me this long to figure out how to make a simple card or poster. The current obstacle that I have encountered it how to import the addresses from my outlook to the Printshop address book. If you are looking for simplicity...you may want to skip this PS20."
3,Poor online access,"I am a former PrintMaster Platinum 8.0 user so I thought being the same company would mean the same quality. Unfortunately I didn't read these reviews first. I bought the DVD format so that I wouldn't have to deal with a lot of disk swapping. The problem is when I don't find what I want on the DVD and try to use the online feature it is realy slow (I admit, I am still a 56K modem user), or I can't access it at all. I would have prefered having a second DVD to access all the images."
4,Better than the old.,This product has many improvements from the older versions and is at a fair price.
5,Print Shop Review,"Even though this product was not the most recent version of Print Shop, for the money it does all that I need for it to do. All the Print Shop versions that I have used both at the office and here at home are also very user friendly."
1,What a scam...,"Don't buy this program unless you enjoy having to switch cd's several times troughout each project. And, now I keep getting emails from Brodebund trying to sell me one disc with the whole program. It has got to be the most shameless marketing plan I have ever seen. And, frankly, the graphics just aren't all that great. But, alas, I am stuck with it. Every time I have to make a card for another of the endless kid birthday parties my blood pressure rises. Save yourself."
1,Will not run on XP - BEWARE,"Purchased this product because I just got a NEW computer (with NEW drivers). Installed it. It will not display anything. I spent three hours running through all the ""HELP"" suggestions, changing everything they suggested, only to change it BACK when it did nothing. Then tried nevigating their site (good luck). When I FINALLY got to a screen where I could email them I demanded my money back. Still haven't heard anything. DO NOT buy this if you are running XP."
1,Bad bad bad,This is the worst graphics program I have ever used. When Print Shop was owned by Parson's Technology many many years ago it was easier to work with and I never had a problem with my PC crashing. Their customer service is worse. Don't buy this program.
1,Worst Program I've ever used,"I have used photo editing and publishing software but this is the worst. I had no problem starting out and importing pictures into the program. One of the many problems I have experienced is, if you try to crop a picture, the program moves the crop over where it wants. It's easier to edit your picture before you import it. Also, the project templates are very limited. I am very disapointed with the program and feel like it is a big waste of money."
1,If there was less than 1 star this product would get it.,The software will not even perform a basic crop function correctly. I found it to be totally useless. Their tech support is non existent. If you use their contact us feature they promise to reply within 4-5 business hours. I still have not heard from them a week later. Their website sends you to encoreusa.com for support if you bought the software from anywhere other than their website. Encore's website is just as unless. No support-just a run around. It did state that this software is not supported for laptop use- a fact they failed to mention on the box the product came in. To get a refund you are supposed to enclose your receipt and send the product back at your expense. I don't know why you would trust them to refund your money or even admit to receiving the return since they can't be trusted to contact you per their website policy. I will never buy another broderbund product again.
2,Software Fine - IT JUST WONT PRINT GRAPHICS,I had a few problems with an earlier version but decided to give Version 20 a go. I am familiar with the program and like the outcome of all my projects. The problem is that it will not print any graphics at all. Customer service is hopeless.The one simple change suggested in their troubleshooter was ineffective. What good is a print program that will not print. very dissapointed.
1,Print shop 2.0 worthless,Dont waste your money.Loaded with bugs and other issues. From the the time you spend trying to fix it you could go down to your local print shop and have done what this is suppose to do. The softawre is not worth the 80 dollars we spent on it.Buyer beware period....
2,Failed to treceive full set of cd's,"I ordered this product but received it without the program disk. The reason I ordered this was to have the program disk as I have lost the one I had. Now I have two install cd'sm, 2 art i cd, and 2 art 2 cd, and cannot use either set."
4,Mastering French,"I have wasted lots of money on language learning CD's that were worthless. This set is excellent. You get 10 CD's, not the 2 or 3 that most sets have. I thought the format was excellent. There are only 3 minor problems: 1) There is no book - all of the work is oral; 2) the bulk of the material is not geared for the beginning learner; and 3) the speaker on the CD's has a regional accent on some words. I have studied French before so my previous studies helped, especially without a book. In spite of these drawbacks, I highly recommend this set. The CD's really prepared me for my trip to France and the price is quite a bargain!"
4,mastering french,"This is a great product, they repeat everything twice so you can repeat it with them the second time. Sometimes they are speaking very quickly and it's difficult to hear what the word is, but for a package designed to help travelers, this is an amazing product."
2,Good...unless you need customer service,"I recently broke my stoneware insert. If this happens to you, just go buy another crockpot, DON'T try to replace the insert. The Rival people sent the wrong size twice, as well as a bunch of other things I had not ordered, and when I asked for my credit card to be refunded, they did not respond. Luckily my credit card company was more helpful, or I would have paid for that stuff! I kept trying with them until my letter to the Rival president received no response--then I went out and bought a Hamilton-Beach. It's great, by the way...."
4,"Vol. 6 - ""Zeros & Ones Organized in Harmony""","Straight outta Germany. Tresor Records puts out it's SIXTH compilation.

5,the best K-drama.,"if you loves K-drama, you can't missed this series. It was one of the best DVD ever. KWON SANG WOO & CHOI JI WOO gives their best performent in this series. They're so natural, so romantic, so so good together. Their kisses, their touches, their togetherness was so real. You can't help but fall-in love with them. The way KWON SANG WOO loves CHOI JI WOO was so dear, so gentle. It makes you cry your heart out. This's the LOVE STORY you must see."
3,English subtitles poorly done,"I watched Stairway to heaven years ago when it first came out. It's a great drama. However, the version I saw on cable t.v. in Hawaii had much better english translations. I was not aware there were different versions. The one I received seems to have been reproduced in Hong Kong and the default dubbing they had it at was chinese. At first I was worried it did not have subtitles at all as the subtitles cannot be found in the main menu. Depending on your DVD player you can press the subtitle button and they have various languages. It seems the version I have was translated in China as many of the names are romanized into Chinese names and the contractions, verbs and words are often misused or misspelled. It is almost unwatchable as the subtitles are so poorly written. So for American/English speaking viewers just be cognizant that there are several translated versions."
5,Wind Muff,"This is a great wind muff, it works really well with the Rode microphone and does its job of keeping out the unwanted noises"
4,Wish I Had Waited,"I bought theRode Deadcat Wind Muff Microphonealong with my Rode Video Mic. It works great - no worries there. But the price? C'mon, man!I built a wind muff for another of my shotgun mics using the fur headband from a Dollar Tree Santa Hat. Seriously. Head-to-head, you'd have a difficult time determining me which one I used in which videos.Good product, but severely overpriced."
4,Useful but trickyI,"I bought this Deadcat because it was recomended for the Video Mic Pro RODE, but actually it doesn't fit right. The thing is that even though it is not the proper wind muff for the VMP it still is very useful and you can put it in the VMP. Works wonder with my other microphones too"
5,Snug as a bug,Although this was expensive it fits perfect on my Rode mic. It seems to filter s's & p's without muffling the sound.
1,Does't worth it,Why spend that much money when you can built your own windmuff... go check out this video in youtube ( /watch?v=1WWkQh-hwiA ) to learn more on how to create your own windmuff for less than 10$.
2,Not good enough,"I have to say that this used with my Rode NTG2 Shotgun did not produce very good results. I was recording dialog outside, and in my experience it simply did not cut the wind to where I could use the audio. In other words the wind took over. In the end we had to stand between two buildings while using the Deadcat. I know Rode also makes a blimp, but I'm not sure I want to try that unless I could try it first.I've had great experiences with other Rode products, but not this."
5,For the windy situations,"Great wind shield to use on your mic while recording outside.It cuts the strong wind, while getting good quality sound."
2,Very Poor Wind Noise Reduction over 5 MPH,"Tried this on several on-off comparisons in different wind conditions.. Really had little or no impact on any breeze over 5 mph. At 10 mph, the wind effect was awful and the deadcat offered little value. I would not recommend - a cheap, consumer-level product."
2,You MUST Have the Rode WSVM foam windshield first,What they don't tell you anywhere is it goes with the Rode foam windshield. and does not work alone. My last furry windshield attached directly without the added foam. It should state this somewhere in the description. Now I will purchase the needed foam windshield to make this complete.
3,"Good, but price is too high","Great for outdoor use, however it should not be $40, maybe $20. But if you use a Rode Videomic and do a lot of outdoor recording, you should definitely get this."
2,another broken driveshaft,I haven't had my trimmer for more than 3 months when my driveshaft broke. My last trimmer lasted for 4 and a half years. I expected more out of this thing. When I called Troy they told me it wasn't covered. The driveshaft would cost $60. This sounds like an engineering issue to me.
5,Troy-Bilt TB425CS - It's worth the money!!!,"I went through many many weedeaters from Walmart. You know, the cheap ones that you think you can get by with. They certainly look better than the electric type, cause you don't have to tug a cord around and be limited by it's length.I finally broke down and got a Troy-Bilt TB425CS. And I haven't regretted it since. I've had it for a year now, and it still starts on the first pull, every time. It's nice to have the oil seperate from the gas, then I don't have to worry about the oil to gas ratio being correct.I definitely definitely definitely recommend getting one of these trimmers. It'll pay for itself and save your hands and sanity."
1,Poor design,"The trimmer is not balanced well. The throttle is too far away from the engine which makes it difficult to operate. If the throttle was moved back closer to the engine, you would have much better control. Unit vibrates excessively. Using without gloves makes your hands sting. I contacted the manufacturer and received a very impersonal ""canned"" response. I'd never purchase a TroyBilt product again. Very disappointed!"
1,Buyer beware!,"This is the first time I feel strongly enough about a product to write a review. I bought it at Lowes and used it for roughly 2 years before it became completely useless. During the time it was useful, it wasn't necessarily smooth running. Sometimes it worked well, other times it seemed out of balance and lacking in power. As of last year (2007), it is useless. If (BIG IF) it starts, it idles very roughly and dies when any attempt is made to speed it up. Impossible to use. I tried higher quality fuel; I've taken the carb apart thoroughly cleaning it; I've checked the spark; etc. Nothing helps. I've also discovered through searching the Internet that others have had similar and other problems.It could be that I was spoiled by the Craftsman trimmer I had for eight years. I bought it used for $50 and it was still working well when I gave it away.Don't waste your money on this Troy-Bilt trimmer!"
2,Buy Something Else,"I Would Had Given This Product A Four Star Rating Had It Not The Speed Spool. This Feature Is A Joke. It Has Cause The Drive Shaft To Break On Two Occasions Because I Have To Bump The Head Of The Spool So Hard To Get It To Feed The String Out. Loading The Spool Is Not So Easy, It Jams When Turning The Spool To Load The String. The Only Good Thing About This Product Is The Motor, It Has Good Power And Has Less Emissions."
4,Great Cork screw,I believe that this is one of the best cork screws you can get. The one issue that I have is that on the final pull the portion of the lever that pushes on the bottle lip can crush the glass slightly.Other than that it works better than any other hand operated cork screw that I have used.
1,Damages the glass,"unfortunately, the thin metal which rests against the bottle cracks the glass on the neck of the bottle! Unless you want chips of glass in your wine, stay away from this corkscrew!"
3,Can't go wrong with Cos! but disc is too expensive,"Now that the Cosby Show is being released in season sets with full episodes, the Columbia House DVDs seem overpriced for the number of episodes you get. I'd go for the recent releases because you only get 5 or 6 episodes here."
5,Quill assembly,"Quill assemblies were perfect. They whole quill was cheaper than replacing bearings. Prompt shipping, they fit perfect. They were better than the ones on there!!"
1,Stay the heck away from.,Buy a Hitachi or another brand. I have had 3 of these die most recently on a mac mini. They put these in all of mac mini's. PLEASE DO NOT BUY A MAC MINI unless you replace the HD with a reliable one.
1,Poor for fans,I didnt like it. It was too short and none Robbie interview. I didnt like it the info is too poor.
5,Nice Steel,"At least it would have been, if they had been able to send it. Continually they show Kitchen type items in stock when they aren't, be aware of this, and watch your order or you could sit for weeks waiting for something that will never arrive."
4,Excellent Buy,It works well. Perhaps even deserves a 5 star rating. Not having a ot of experience with a steel I am not sure how much better it should sharpen.
2,Started to rust`,"I keep it clean...yet its starting to rust??? Not worth the money, and beware...this is not used to sharpen your knives, just hone them!!"
3,"Wusthof 10"" Steel","Some argue all steel's are the same, others say they aren't. I tend to believe they are all basically the same. Regardless, many want a steel that matches the brand and quality of their best knives, as I did. This 10"" steel does exactly what it is supposed to however I am disappointed in the quality of the handle. I spent the extra money for the brand name and expectation of quality. The handle appears to be cheaply made, not attached well, and even the famous Wusthof logo was applied crooked. bummer."
5,Wusthof 10 inch Steel,"I only wish I had bought this steel years ago. Although technically it won't sharpen a dull knife, it does an excellent job of maintaining the cutting edge on a knife once it has been sharpened. It only takes seconds to run a few strokes over the steel and is much easier on an expensive knife than constantly sharpening it with abrasive stones."
2,Crappy Handle,"Ok, so the functional portion is fine, but I bought this to replace my previous Wustof steel and the handle quality is absurdly poor. It's just a chunk of low grade plastic with a Chiquita banana quality sticker. I thought Wustof stood for quality, either this is a knock off and Amazon has been duped or Wustof has just started rubber stamping its brand on any old thing."
5,Makes my knives like new,"This product was recommended to me by a chef. The surface is pretty smooth (no short diamond pattern). It's easy to sharpen my chefs knife after using it. I guess the sticker logo isn't as fancy as an engraved logo, but I don't care. The steel works and that's what I'm buying it for."
4,Great Floss,Best floss to use. No complaints on product or shipping. Only issue is that the picture is not what was shipped to me. The picture is for the super thin version and the one sent is the regular version. The super thin is my preference and this is somewhat misleading.
4,A good production.,"This album shows a great violinist. Is a great production. My favorites are: Psalm 42, A Song or Freddy and Land of Dreams. But the whole album is good."
4,Excellent introduction,This is an excllent start for librarians interested in graphic novel collections. The information is up to date and has excellent ideas for programs based on graphic novels.
5,One of Denise's best!,This tape is most effective when you do both the 20 minute segments. The moves are easy to follow after you'd done them a few times. (Despite Denise's not-so-good counting and cues)I work out five times a week and I switch off between this tape and Denise's Ultimate Fat Burner tape. I dropped a few pounds after only a week of using them and noticed some muscle definition in my arms and thighs. Circuit training is really the way to go if you want to lose weight effectively. This tape will give you a great workout and I highly recommend it.
4,Big Denise Austin Fan,"I am a big fan of Austin's, and love the book of the same title. The video is a good workout, but I don't like Denise trying to do kick boxing moves. She looks akward doing them, and I feel akward working out with it. If you like kick boxing-this is for you. If you like basic a workout, try Fat Burning Blast"
3,Fun but Challenging,"This is a fun workout, but I wouldn't recommend it as an introduction if you are just beginning to work out and trying to loose weight, as it could easily become frustrating. I workout regularly, and it still took me a while before I could do this workout all the way through. Once you build up some muscle strength, though, it really is quite fun. And I have no doubt that if you did this workout every day, you would lose 10 lbs. I don't use it for that though; it's also a fun video to alternate into your normal workout routine."
3,"OK, I'll work out, if I have to","I bought this tape used, to break up my routine, and with any luck blast away 10 pounds at the same time. The first 20 minute work out is very challenging, not because of the aerobic level, but because of the tricky dance steps. Also there are minimal cues from Denise Austin to let you know the count or what the next step is. Most likely you'll need to go through this routine several times before you get a handle on it.The second 20 minute routine is interval, and the aerobic portion is easier to manage--the dance steps are much more straight forward. The strength training here is great, but its also set to music and Denise has no sense of rythym--you'll need to coordinate the motions to the music for yourself.Overall a good buy for a change in routine, but if this is the only exersize tape you use, you'll get frustrated fast. It'll take more than this to loose 10 pounds."
3,Only worth the first 20 minutes...,"The first twenty minutes of this video are great, really get's you going....the second half of the video however is really weak. As a full 40 minute workout this video is not the best, but if you have 20 minutes and want to get an intense aerobic kickboxing session then this is for you."
3,"This workout makes you sweat, but...","I have to say I hate Denise Austin's style. Her cueing is the WORST I have ever seen. Throughout the tape she is constantly getting off of the beat, doing fewer reps of a particular move than she originally said to do, and so on. It is so bad that even the cast in this workout gets confused several times, and does the wrong move at the wrong time. However, like I said it does make you sweat and it does have some 'fun factor' with the kicks and punches. Also it is great if you are in a time crunch or if you want to add a 20 minutes extra minutes of cardio, in addition to your regular workout. This workout is not for the novice though, it gets the heart rate up pretty high, and requires good ab and back strength. I would say it was fine for intermediate exercisers, and beginners could do this too, with modifications."
5,blasted 10,"I recommend this video highly to anyone. I gained over 50lbs when I had my first baby and never thought I would loose the weight (175 lbs.) I bought this and did this workout about 3-4x a week. After a couple of months I was back down to 125 and so happy. I recently had my 2nd baby and now about to start again. Im started again, my weight now is 164 and I Know I'll loose it with this workout"
2,Save Your Money,"I have several of Denise Austin's workout tapes, but this is just not good. She fails to give cues, you just look up and she's changed moves. It's quite annoying. I think she was talking so much that she missed the cue. Definitely not one of my favorites."
4,Good workout,I enjoyed the 1st section the most (more kickboxing moves). It seemed to get my heart rate up!
2,A little Confusing,"Okay, I like Denise Austin and after reading the reviews I purchased her DVD. Had to turn it off after 10 minutes. She is all over the place! Even her back up is confused by her! She goes into a move without even giving you a heads up on what she is doing next. The movements just didn't flow but since I now own the dvd I guess I will give it another try."
2,Terrible quality!!,"This DVD says on the package ""full screen"" and when I play it on my 42"" plasma it looks AWFUL! The people are all squatty and chubby looking - not exactly a great inspiration in a workout tape!! I went back to amazon and nowhere did I see clear lables of ""full screen"" or ""widescreen"" or anything else like that. While I realize I probably ordered the wrong version, I can't find where I could've done otherwise. Very disappointed and don't know if I'll even use the DVD as it's so hard to watch this way. Be warned and don't make my mistake - order the correct version for your TV (if you can)."
1,don't waste your time or money,"This is a terrible terrible kickboxing workout. The production values are from 1978, Ms. Austin's cueing is non-existant and most egregiously, Austin has the presence of a bag of hair.If you want to actually break a sweat try the Janis Saffell Hardcore Kickboxing."
4,Times flies after you get the moves!,"Denise is not always the best with her cues but after you have done this video a few times, it becomes a solid cardio workout. I look forward to doing this video because of the interval training and she does keep you motivated to finish! I am not one to like extremely peppy people but when I'm working out, I need it! Worth the money."
4,Great Up Beat Workout,Denise Austin's Blast Away 10 lbs Kickboxing is very motivational. You will need good balance and coordination to perform these moves. I consider myself to be intermediate but have never tried kickboxing. My second attempt at this I landed on my left foot wrong and did Damage! Be careful with this one. Take your time and Enjoy!!
3,denise austin video,"this video is definitely not for beginners. instead of explaining what she's going to do before she does it, austin goes right into it. this caused me to get mixed up and become out sink with the video. however, i suppose after a couple times the viewer probably memorizes the moves. but, what i dont understand is how someone overweight could do this video...its called blast away 10 pounds so im assuming its targeted to people who are overweight. i am not overweight, and just wanted a kickboxing video and i found it difficult..does anyone have and suggestions? thanks"
3,GOOD WORKOUT TERRIBLE CUEING!,"The 20 minute workout is great when you need a quick fix, but the cueing is the worst i have ever seen! For being a fitness guru and having done this for years, Denise Austin often looses her count, misinstructs moves, OR dosent instruct changes in moves at all! The music often dosent fit the moves because she looses count so often and I am a little frustrated KNOWING that this with all the money the Denise Austin Exercise Racket brings in, that she couldnt at least ""re-tape"" her mistakes to sell us a decently produced tape."
4,Great workout!,"I own Denise's Kickboxing workout, which is great. This tape is equally as good; however, the second workout could have used more workout with the weights. The first workout is a super-charged, cardio kickboxing workout that will definitely burn those calories--the second workout is an interval workout with weights. It uses some dance moves, which I didn't find too challenging; however, Denise uses a little kickboxing throughout, which I do like. The last segment of that second workout seemed to fizzle out (Denise just slowly moves side to side throwing jabs). Overall, if used together, both workouts will get you sweating. It's worth buying the tape strictly for the first workout. I wish Denise would make some new kickboxing tapes...they're very effective."
3,Good for the Beginner\Intermediate workout,"This is a great beginner\to intermediate workout viedo. I say intermediate because I enjoy the 1st 20 minute kickboxing session on my ""take it easy days"". The 2nd 20 minute session is good for a beginner.I would recommend this to a beginner or intermediate (reason stated above) in fitness. For the advanced try the Power Kickboxing by Denise Austin, great 45 min. workout!!"
3,Good for the Intermediate workout,"This is a great beginner\to intermediate workout viedo. I say intermediate because I enjoy the 1st 20 minute kickboxing session on my ""take it easy days"". The 2nd 20 minute session is good for a beginner.I would recommend this to a beginner or intermediate (reason stated above) in fitness. For the advanced try the Power Kickboxing by Denise Austin, great 45 min. workout!!"
2,Not really worth it,"This is the first Denise Austin video I have purchased. Personally, I find her to be an unorganized instructor. She changes moves without much warning and barely explains any of the moves. If you get to the point where you can stand the confusion, you can actually break a sweat. Denise constantly motivates you to keep trying, but overall, I thought for sure, anyone with numerous videos, books, and TV shows would be more organized and informative. Unless you are a big fan of hers, I suggest skipping this one."
5,Last 10 pounds GONE!,"I recommend this workout for people that have been exercising pretty regularly but are having problems getting rid of those last few pounds, or just want it gone NOW. Very high energy. Denise does not que the moves beforehand very well because there are so many changes in the routine that she'd be talking twenty times more than she already does, and I don't think we want that. Try it, you'll like it!"
4,Non intimidating intro to kickboxing,"This was my first kickboxing DVD and I chose it because I've got several Denise Austin DVD's and figured this would be a good introduction. It definitley gets your heart rate up in both the cardio and interval training segments. She's a bit hard to follow and her cueing is on the bad side, but after you do it a couple of times, it's not too bad. My real complaint here is the music and the set. Where does she come up with her music? This is a fun start and is a good work out."
3,The potential is there,"This workout dvd is great as far as the actual workout goes but it was lacking good instruction from Denise whose tapes are generally well done. One minute you are performing one particular move, then without warning you have to move onto something else with no notice as she doesn't count out how many repetitions are left to go, or what comes next (to get you prepared). If you aren't distracted by the exercisers in this tape also not knowing what comes next (some don't catch on right away while others have started moves Denise hasn't started yet) then the workout itself will help you burn calories and for that alone it's worth the money."
5,cardio,when I do not have time to make it to the gym i use this tape and a quick cardio and i love it...it has kick boxing followed by ineterval training
2,Let the Buyer Beware,"This is a flimsy, lightweight piece of equipment. Tubing that forms the legs bends easily and there is simply nothing heavy duty about this item."
4,product safety hazard,The switchboard we got foe my Grand son does not lock properly and when going off a small jump the handle did not stay up causing him to fall and luckly he was not injured... the lock for the handle needs to be better built....
1,This is the worst toy ever!,"It looks fun in the picture, but there is a major design flaw with this toy - the wheels stick out so far that when the rider tries to go they end up slamming their ankle into the tire. Within 2 minutes of using this toy my son ripped open his ankle. This toy should be recalled. Do not buy it. I would send mine back, but we had already thrown out the packaging."
3,I guess it's okay for _very_ young children...,"I bought this product for my daughter for Xmas two years ago. It hasn't got much use because it is difficult to steer on a narrow sidewalk. Even so, the wheels have become very loose on their plastic trucks, and I can't find a way to adjust them! If you're looking for a scooter, skip this and buy another type of scooter. If you're looking for something to train a young child to ride a skateboard, this may be for you. I'd recommend this off-road model as opposed to the one with the regluar skateboard wheels - the off-road wheels can take more abuse and they can handle riding on grass and bumps. Because of its limited speed and steering, I wouldn't recommend this for a child older than 4. Older kids will struggle to keep up with their friends riding regular scooters if they're riding a Switchboard!"
1,Full of mathematical errors.Beware! Wastage of Money.,"Looking for book to blow you out your wits, waste your time and money. Then you have found the boook your looking for. Yes! it comes with a confusion GAURANTEED.. Whats more you also get free mathematical errors for no cost at all but your time...Ladies and Gentlemen presenting.. ""The W.D. Gann Method of Trading"" a SIMPLIFIED ( Yeah right ), CLEAR ( hehhehe) approach... by Gerald Marisch."
2,Anything but Simplified and Clear...,"Gann's trading methods have always been a mystery to those of us who don't understand his strategies. However, this book makes an attempt to resolve the mystery behind Gann's trading system and it's almost more ""simplified"" if you read a book that Gann had written himself. This book does nothing to shed light on how Gann worked his magic. You're better off reading something by William Gann himself and trying to decipher his methods on your own."
1,I was totally duped...,"...about 5 years ago in IBD there was an ad for thisbook in which the book seller said this book was fulltop secret info never before available and only availablefor the next 2 or 3 days, then the offer is gone forever.I panic bought. I feel like a total fool.This book is worthless."
5,Buenisismo!,"He leido todos los libros de Isabel, y este es mi segundo favorito... (1ro esta la Casa de los Espiritus!)... la manera en que la Allende nos envuelve en el caracter de cada uno de los personajes es increible.. El libro esta preciosamente narrado y el perfil de los personajes tan bien definido y claro que parece que los conocieramos a cada uno... Me parecio excelente..!"
5,UNO DE MIS LIBROS FAVORITOS,"Este es un libro que más he disfrutado en mi vida, pues tiene el personaje principal es muy real, con todo y la fantasía que le rodea, un personaje inolvidable dueño de una historia igualmente inolvidable."
3,Hard to read,"I have read several Latin American authors with avid interest. So often they seem to have something new to say, or, something to say in a new and interesting way. This book seems to have neither of those virtues: the Spanish is wordy and descriptive, but lacks a certain poetry I have got used to by other authors; and the themes do not strike me as new, or treated in a novel way. The storyline was also very disjoint! Perhaps the authoress was trying to capture a sense of the protagonist's own confusion, living through a troubled childhood, broken relationships and war. Whatever the intention, it made this book incredibly difficult to read, despite how good the storyline when all the broken lines were connected. So I guess overall (assuming Allende's intention was to present a broken-up kind of story) it is not that bad, though I had expected something much better and enjoyable to read."
1,Isabel Allende's bomb,"Very poor book. Isabel Allende seems to have lost her way with this one. For some reason it doesn't flow, it is a mish mash of ideas and stories and strayed too far from what she is very good at.Definitely not one of her good ones."
1,"Works, but...","To the previous reviewer - it is too bad you had such trouble. The trick is to attach the heel of the shoe-shaped shelf bracket to the wall with the sole UP, then place the shelf on the (relatively) level sole of the shoe/bracket thing. I found that in this configuration the shelf could easily support of box of facial tissue and a greeting card, though supporting a 50-gallon aquarium produced disastrous results.Still, I have to give this product just one star because it does not come in brushed nickel and the tophat-wearing fish emblem does not match my decor."
5,Great for the little things...,"...like melting butter or warming spaghetti sauce. For a quick breakfast, throw an egg in one of these and cook some toast. I have had a stockpot for years, but when cooking for yourself a 5qt pot isn't too practical (unless you like leftovers). Most of my meals get cooked using this pot and the 10"" skillet. They heat up quick, are naturally non-stick, virtually indestructible, and CHEAP! Yes, they do require a bit of special treatment, but they are worth it. You will not regret getting cast-iron cookware. Just don't drop it on your foot! Enjoy!!!"
5,A Great Grill Accessory,"Living on the coast of Maine, summer means seafood on the barbie. Whether you are steaming clams or grilling lobster, butter is an essential. This little pot is perfect for keeping warm butter at your fingertips. It's also the perfect size for basting roasted corn-on-the-cob. The little pour spout is a nice touch for avoiding spills. I picked this up as soon as I came across it and have enjoyed it many times. You will have to treat it differently in terms of seasoning and care but it will last you a lifetime (and probably your kids' lives as well)."
4,I am pumped up!,"Great system.Missed one star due to the fact that seats needs to go down just 1 or 2 inches more... I'm 6'5"" but I can still do everything on the machine -- just not perfectly.Big pro is that it required no connection to the wall."
2,robin,"Buyer Be Ware! This rival product let me down. The lid did not fit snug. In fact, it slid around loosely and left a gap on each side of the rim approx. 1/2"". Concerned that the defective lid would not hold heat to properly cook food, I called customer service and they sent me a replacement lid once I verified that my lid wobbled when placed on a flat surface. Guess what! The replacement lid did the exact same thing! Needless to say, I returned the item for a complete refund."
4,A pleased PS user,"I have owned PS 12,15 & 20 and I like them all. I even have PrintMaster 11 and I like that as well but PS 20 made some good improvements. The improvement I like most is the optimal print resolution which makes fonts print much more smoothly. As for installation I have never had a problem with PS 20. I had a minor issue with PS 15 but every install of PS 20 went fine for me. I have done many projects with PS 20 from photos to greeting cards to brochures and many more things. I think its a great product and I use quite often"
1,Don't buy this..,I agree with the first reviewer. I tried at least 6 or 7 times and it wouldn't install. I also have XP and more than enough space on the computer for this program. I am out $30 b/c I can't return it. I couldn't even find a tech support phone #.
1,Print Shop Deluxe 20 has problems,"I, unfortunately, own PSD 20... No problems loading and using with XP, but wish I had done more research before purchasing. I used it for business cards and brochures and after a loooooonnnnng time on hold on their support line (had to call the corporate office who gave me a LD number to call), found out that the program won't print past a certain ""margin"" edge width unless your printer will print ""full bleed"" (meaning all the way to the edge). All of the art and examples on their box show everything printed all the way to the edge. Nowhere does it state that you have to have a certain printer or special printer capability to use the software. So for now (until I have time to do the research for a better alternative), my brochures and business cards are a bit lopsided.Otherwise, it's easy enough to use. Wouldn't buy it again."
2,Not worth it.,"Don't pay $30 for this, just buy older version Print Shop 11 for $9. You would expect to see more tools in newer 20 version, but everything is exactly the same as Print Shop 11, and 11 has more special effects. Does anyone have Print Shop Delux 20 ? Please write a review if it's worth buying. Only reason I use Print Shop is because it's easy, too bad they don't improve it, all reviews I see for any Print Shop are not too good. Does anyone know similar software with better performants and more tools? Please somebody recomend something(write a review under Print Shop 20)."
2,Why can't I find a serviceable funky carafe?,"I should have looked more closely at the picture. I shouldn't have ordered from this company again in the first place as the other carafe I had from them got moisture and grounds inbetween the thermos and the outer shell and when I tried to clean it, the parts wouldn't fit back together correctly. But they have such cute styles and I needed a carafe so I picked out this one. I use a Melita cone to make my coffee and did not realize that the top of this pot is so wavy that there is no way to rest the cone on top. Great. Now I have to brew into a different pot and decant it into this one? Maybe I'll switch to instant. I'll let you all know if I get the same leakage problems with this one."
1,Leave it to Classic Rock Legends to screw this up!,"This dvd has a silent menu.Runs 70m.This Sucks!Let me tell you why.Every damn song is interrupted with interviews except the last,leading up to the end credits.I would have liked to see them do those music selections,not gonna happen.Sometimes the interviews are louder than the music and vice versa on the music to interviews.If you want to view a history of the band then it might be ok for you otherwise forget about it.I didn't like it and would not recommend it."
2,Sandal,This is extremely hard and heavy - not comfortable because it is so heavy - it makes you stumble and then the leather straps are so hard. Don't like it.
1,Trouble with purchase,"I did not receive my order so went directly to seller, after investigation seems his daughter took the DVD to college with her, needless to say I canceled but did get credit. Be careful who seller is on products ordered."
2,Little new here,"Most likely anyone who's been around the rooms on a regular basis for more than a few months has heard most of what is in here...And that which they haven't heard is otherwise predictable. Unfortunately, most ""recovery humor"" is best suited to the feeble and middle brow humor of 60's and 70's Readers Digest, and this book is no exception. It's just plain corny and it's really not very funny. Addiction and recovery can be so dark and edgy; it would be nice to see some of that reflected in the literature and humor."
5,Dont take yourself so seriously.,A lot of funny items within the book.It is a really great way of carrying the AA message.
4,Recovery assistance,"Great book. A book that help those having problems with Drugs and Alcohol. Like the book says, sometimes we need a laugh to help ease the pain."
2,corny is right,"Its not funny. Most of the (occasional) smiles you'll get are because the ""humor"" is so stupid. The other reviewer who called it ""just plain corny"" is right. I really don't know why this is called 12-step humor. You hear far funnier stuff in meetings."
5,I liked it,I like it for my Face and i been using it for 8years and my skin looks good..thats oll i have to say
1,Don't notice a difference,"Bought this figuring it wouldn't make a difference, but figured it wouldn't hurt to try...I was right, it doesn't make a difference. Wouldn't waste your money."
1,Defective product,"I used Strivectin several years ago and really liked it. However, my recent purchase through 101BeautyStore was less than satisfactory. The product I received was old. Strivectin turns a tanish brown color when it is old. There was no expiration date ANYWHERE on the product or the product packaging. My rating is actually for the seller and the product I received not Strivectin as a whole. I followed the proper procedures for reporting the defective product to 101BeautyStore and they never responded. I then contacted Amazon, took the proper steps and am happy to say Amazon was fantastic in refunding my money in a very professional and courteous manner. I will defintely still shop on Amazon but will not purchase from 101BeautyStore."
1,"MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE",Can't buy something when I have no idea what footage this includes. Please add a description and I will consider buying this and other National Archives DVD's.
3,ceramic peeler is ok but not the only peeler you will ever need.,"Harder to used than I expected. I really only use it for a few things like peeling an uncooked butternut squash. My oxo still works best for carrots, cucumbers etc."
1,Very disappointed in the Cyocera peeler.,I took Alixis Stewart's ( Martha's daughter) advice and ordered this peeler. Sadly it broke after only the second use! Too bad. I thought I had solved my peeler issue!
3,"Good buy, but the blade got a crack after 2 months of use","Works and looks great, the blade is sharp and smooth. The blade is made in Japan and the handle is made in China. I recommend buying the color that doesn't match any table scraps you potentially will be peeling. I had one in orange (authentic Kyocera bought in Japan) and accidentally threw it out with the carrot skins I peeled :)Overall - good buy and worth the money.Update: the blade got a crack. It still holds in place and usable - but definitely cracked. So I take off 2 stars."
2,The veggie peeler worked for a while,"Yes, the blade is very sharp, but after a few months of daily use the rotating ""cartridge"" stopped tracking the surface of the veggie being peeled. So I tossed this one and reverted to my $3 steel peeler. However, this ceramic peeler for worked way better than another ceramic peeler I'd received for Christmas from my family (a Swiss-made one bought at our local gourmet cooking store.)"
4,Great Kitchen Gadget,This is one of the best peelers that I have ever used. I like the ceramic blade because it peels well and just seems more sanitary than metal blades.
3,the head moves too much,love their products. have their knives and love them.but the head moves too much.
3,Not life-changing,"but good. I thought it would be sooo much easier to use than my conventional peeler, but it's only slightly so. It does a great job with thin-skinned vegetables, like carrots or potatoes, but I struggle just as much with beets as I did with my old peeler. I'm hoping that the more I use it the more it becomes comfortable in my hand."
5,two thums up!,This ceramic peeler is amazing!It peels like butter......a must for anyone who peels anything!
5,Used the blade to make a Nernst lamp,"The zirconium blade, when broken into slivers works perfectly as a lighting element in a Nernst lamp. I have no idea how it would work as a peeler."
4,Good for certain vegetables,"I love this peeler for some vegetables; I hate it for others.The sharp edge gets through the tough skins of butternut squash like nothing else I've ever used. It's pretty good for mangoes too. I don't much like it for carrots and cucumbers, as the peel tends to flip around and get caught back under the blade. I also don't like it for potatoes, as it's hard to use this peeler while drawing the blade away from my fingers. I either drop the spud or unconsciously rotate the blade until I find myself pulling towards my fingers instead of away. The blade is so sharp you don't even feel the cut at first...I'd recommend this peeler if you need to peel large, round, tough skinned fruits and veggies. I'd stick with a conventional peeler for long, thin veggies and for all but the largest potatoes."
2,really only good for potatoes,"I could not get it to work on fruits. I tried mangos, peaches, apples, etc. The rotating blade gets pretty annoying. However, it works pretty good on potatos, taro, carrots, and similar. The potato ""eye"" remover works pretty good as well. Overall, I prefer my cheapy OXO peeler."
3,CP-20 Peeler Good peeler but one huge problem,"I have had this CP-20 peeler about 4 months now. It worked great at first and I was really happy with the sharp ceramic blade and the way the head angle can be adjusted. But recently, it wasn't working so good and on inspection the plastic frame that carries the ceramic blade is warped and broken. This looks heat-related to me, but the peeler is advertised to be dishwasher safe. If you do get this peeler, don't wash it in the dishwasher."
4,peeler,The Peeler is easy to use good grip and was as expected... I like this type of peeler and i a happy using this product. It was just as described and i recommend using this...
5,Best peeler ever!,"This ceramic peeler beats any other peeler I have tried, by far. It peels those hard-to-peel foods like eggplant, with ease."
5,"The essential companion to ""Spiritual Cannabalism""","With a foreword by Swami Chetanananda, head of the Nityananda Institute and one of Rudi's four senior students from the Brooklyn ashram days, ""Rudi"" is a collection of pithy short essays on a large range of subjects. In some ways, ""Rudi"" is a more practical book than ""Spiritual Cannabalism"", and its scope is more here-and-now. Frankly, it is a humbling book to read---all of one's own foibles are exposed in the reading. As an aside, all four senior students have gone on to be great figures in the contemporary spiritual world (I am happy to correspond on this matter).As well, because of its somewhat segmented structure (in comparison to SC), it is a book that one can have handy at any time, to read a paragraph or two---and be woken up yet again (isn't it irritating how quickly we fall asleep!).Unreservedly recommended."
4,Very Fun!,This book is full of delightful ideas and projects to do with your children. We had hours of fun with it!
1,Beginners Beware - Everyone else don't bother,"I am a CF instructor, and I do use this book as a guide to teach beginners on developing in ColdFusion. However, I do not recommend this book to my students, nor anyone else. The book contains several errors, as well as the Complete code samples on the CD. Often they present 'A' means for setting up your CF site, not necessarily the best. There are plenty of other books to go by that have solid material with solid examples. This is not one of them."
1,Cold Fusion Picture Book,"If you don't know Cold Fusion and can only learn by looking at pictures, you might have a chance to learn something from this book. If you are mildly educated, you would be much better off to buy a book from an author that knows what they are doing. Why buy a book that only goes over the basics when Ben Forta's books go over basics and advanced topics for about the same price. My final comment is that this book is about 1/3 pictures. Don't let the number of pages fool you, cause there is little to read..."
1,Don't buy this book,I justed went to a ColdFusion training class that used this book. It has more errors than it does correct lessons. It refers to databases that do not exist on the CD. The class decided the only thing good for the book was the fireplace. It would be a good book if you did not have to debug their code. New users will have a great deal of difficulty with this. It proved to be so confusing that our instructor stopped using it and came up with his own lesson plan.
2,"""ConFusion""","...the book itself has a majordrawback.....no support!Nowhere can I find any help on how to troubleshoot the installation of the ColdFusion Server....(it installed, but I can't login as Administrator).There is no website, faq, or email address in the book or readme file on the CD....you're on your own.I know I'll figure it out eventually, but the information should be a basic feature of a technical book like this.""Burned"""
5,Information from the Author,"This book was written for a new ColdFusion developer, someone with no ColdFusion experience. However, it does require you to have knowledge of HTML and some Javascript. This book is a great starting point for anyone wanting to learn the basics of ColdFusion. Once you're finished with this book you'll be ready to move on to another book that covers a wider range of topics. If you're ready to make that move, I highly recommend the books from fellow Macromedia Press author Ben Forta."
3,good surfing tutorial,"Good game, my kids use it as a good tutorial. There is no other surfing games out there, so makes it the only and a good one."
4,Endless fun,"The thing about KSPS is that unlike Tony Hawk or Matt Hoffman, this game is not about the fastest button combo's or the biggest airs. Like surfing itself this game is really about being one with the wave, expressing your style and pushing the limits. No other sports game can offer that! The graphics are awesome and the gameplay is smooth. The controls are difficult at first but very comfortable after 20 minutes or a quick run through the mandatory tutorial. I would recommend this game to anyone that likes the idea of surfing but can't get to a local wave.... this game is the closest thing. Also, dropping back in and riding in the barrel is unbelievable!"
1,Buy Transworld Surf,"I was really excited about this title, and went right out to buy it on first release. I am seriously dissapppointed in the lack of diversity in waves and lack of flow in the gameplay...Do not make the mistake I did. Keep Ripping. REal waves are better anyway."
2,Kelly is the best....to bad his game is not!!!,"The bottom line is this...If you want a skateboarding game you buy THPS!!! If you want a snowboarding game you buy SSX!! If you want a surfing game you DON'T buy H30, Sunny Garcia, or now KSPS following in the footsteps of what appears to be yet another quarter pipe with some procedural textures sliding across the surface of it trying to make you believe you are submersed in an ocean!!! Maybe I am wrong and KSPS will deliver TWS caliber wave'(s), and THPS style game play. Personally I am holding out for the PS2 version of Transworld Surf.Happy Surfing"
3,Cool game but lacks details....,"Cool game, but I lost interest quickly asthere is no season tour so you dont have anywhereto go after achieving all of the goals - - If thishad a full world tour it would be great - - butthe noly competition with others is a few heatsand that is it..."
5,"Fun, cooperative game for younger kids","My kids, 3 and 5, love this game. They call it ""the caw game."" It is simple enough for the little one to follow but still keeps the older one interested, and the family wins or loses together."
5,Third Time's a Charm,"Have you ever played thps2, and felt your self wanting more?Well, thps3 forefills the dream, with new levels including Tokyo, and L.A. With the returning allstar lineup, game play rises to an atmospheric level. Can you say creat-a-skater? Yup. You can customize with multiple selections. Alternate ""costumes"" give the game a realistic twist too.Ya remember Spider-Man? Thps3 continues to deliver with marvel comic legend Wolverine. And with Sponcered and Pro tours, the challenges also execle. THPS3 is by far GBA's finest game and is worth buying."
4,fun on the go,"This game is off the chain. The graphics are some of the best I have seen on GBA, the sound is tight, and there are tons of tricks to bust.The controls take a little time to get wired, but once you do, its all good.2 beefs though...some of the levels are too cluttered and you find yourself bouncing off rails ledges staircases etc like a pinball. also you cant choose your specials"
2,2 hard tu control your guy,"i dont like this game at all. no good graphics, it's hard to control your guy, this game is terrible. it's hard to control your guy because when you press down your guy goes foward. whats up with that. and your not alowwed to not play carrier, no free skate. i like this game for pc. its awesome on your computer. i suggest you just get this game for your computer, not for gameboy. and don't try to install thps 2 to your xp, cause it won't werk. i tried. good game for pc, not for game boy advance."
2,The Ps2 version is 10 000 times better,I dont understand why everyone says this is the best game. I recommend that whoever considers buying it rent it first to c how overated this game really is. If u have played the Ps2 version of THP3 u will be extremely dissapointed. The disadvantages to this game is mainly that the useless graphics the extremely hard controls and the impossible missions added to the terrible view u are forced to play from make this game on the bottom of my GBA favourites list.
4,worth the wait,"Activision proves once and for all that an enjoyable skateboarding game can be done on a handheld console. Forget about the Hawk games on the Gameboy Color--those are horrible. If you enjoyed the Playstation/N64 versions of the Hawk series, then I would recommend buying Hawk 3 for the GBA. There are a couple of flaws, but overall the game is worthwhile...Good stuff: phat graphics, large levels, several pros, lots of tricks, realistic action, create a skaterNot so good stuff: control scheme can be frustrating, certain areas on each level are almost impossible to navigate, depth perception issues, ""living levels"" translates into a couple of pedestrians walking around aimlessly that fall down (or punch you) as you skate into them, game is too easy"
4,Bass Tape!,"Project Pat's album is nice. If you have a nice sound system in your car or just love to blast away base on stero at home, this album is for you. Three 6 Mafia productions is excellent and deserves more credit for what they have done. Next I am waiting for Gangsta Boo's album because I am a 3-6 Mafia fan."
4,BOY PLEASE WHATEVER,I THINK THAT PROJECT PAT HAS MADE AN ASTONISHING OUTCOME. fROM CHICKENHEAD TO DON'T SAVE HER ARE ALL ENERGIZING SONGS. YOUR CD IS LOVED IF EVERYONE LOVES THE SAME SPNGS ON THE CD.
5,"Bumpin, of the chain, mane","Project comes grimmy on this one. If you liked Ghetty Green don't even think twice about buying this one its great. Paul and Juicy always lace Pat with the hottest beats, and Pats flows are just butter. His stories are vivid, and his partying and smoking songs are great back drops for a night of optis and syrup. It puzzles me how he comes up with some of his lyrics, the man is amazing and one of my favorites of all time. He frequently changes his flow too, speeding it up and slowing it down, its brillant. If you got a system buy this fo sure. Chicken Heads, Cheese and Dope, Don't Save Her, So High,Ski Mask, and We Aint Scared Hoe are some of my favorites. I love how Paul and Juicy are always changing the beats in the middle of songs too. This is one of the best down south rap releases in a long time, hyptnotize minds has done it again, pick this up fo sure mane. And if you don't, ""You can duck from the teck out the Escalade""."
5,rad album,excellent album. definitely worth the money. if you like three six and the rest of hypnotize camp this is a must have.
4,Off da Chain,"After a listen to Mista don't Play you can tell that his music has matured since Ghetty Green. On the Crunk ""Break da Law 2001"" DJ Paul and Juicy J set the plate for Pat with their thuggish rants. Also Pat shows a sense of humor on ""Chickenhead"" where La Chat and Pat go back and forth, also Pat shows he can hit the clubs and women with Ooh Nutin and ""Don't Save Her"" While die hard Three 6 Mafia fans might not enjoy this offering as much as Ghetty Green because of the crunker material but with this album the listener can sense Pat's ongoing musical maturity."
4,Project Pat,All The songs are good except for few the cd is kinda good. get dj clue professional 2 beats are tight songs rock
4,Bangin,"Project Pat Is one o my favorite rappers and he stayed on that list with this album. My Favorites on here are ""Cheese & Dope"",Break Da Law,and So High. The Thing is, the hardest HCP & 3-6 songs are the ones that they DONT play on the radio. the ones they do play are always slimmed down and sound the same every time. But still, a good piece."
4,Put This In Yah CD Player,After reading great reviews [...] I found that this CD is truly amazing. So far I have enjoyed every last song on the CD and will recommend it to anyone looking for a CD coming from a artist from the Tha Dirty South. I have all of Three 6 Mafia tapes and knew that since he's associated with them it couldn't be that bad. All I know is that Project Pat has come a long way and he's proved it to all of us that if you got the mind and the skill you can do it.Buy This CD and Enjoy!
3,"COUNTRY GD'S AND CRIPZ ""GAY"" !!!","I LIKE SOME OF PROJECT PAT MUSIC BUT ALOT OF IT IS DUMB AND OLD TO ME AND AWAYS REGRET GETTING HIS ALBUMS THIS IS MY 2nd.MY FAVORITE TRACK IS #1 ""CHICKEN HEADS"".DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM.THESE COUNTRY RAPPERS FROM MEMPHIS I DON'T LIKE."
2,Everythang's Workin'? Dunno...,"Project Pat's Mista Don't Play: Everythangs Workin' is alright, I guess. Chickenhead is definately a must-have for any person's rap collection. But you get past that track and ""everythang"" seems to be the same. Project Pat's voice gets repetitive, monotonous and sometimes annoying. There are a few tracks that I like besides Chickenhead: Don't Save Her and Ooh Nuthin' to name most. If you liked Three 6 Mafia's When the Smoke Clears... like I did, you may not like PP's album. PP just doesn't flow as well as 36M in my opinion. This is definately a ""borrow for a week and give back to your friend who actually likes the album"" album."
4,"'Psychedelic Underground,Volume 12' (Garden Of Delights) Various Artists","Volume 12 of the catalog of rare,obscure and little-known German progressive bands that have been released on the Garden Of Delights label.These CD's are of limited edition,so they might be tough to find.Your best bet is to ask mail order CD dealers.I've gotten past volumes of this series just for the asking,when I order at least two full-priced titles.Most impressive cuts here are Joy Unlimited's ""Eden Park"",Faithful Breath's ""Tharsis""(I remember having a vinyl lp by these heavy rockers)and the three XHOL and-related tracks by XHOL,XHOL Caravan and Soul Caravan.Have always liked these experimental acid jazz-rock hippies.A nice audio keepsake."
3,Okay for athletes. Great for snacking: Healthier than Gummy Bears.,"Sharkies taste good, have a nice texture to them, and do provide energy. However, I have tried them on longer runs, and they don't make the cut. They only provide energy for a few minutes. Also, they tend to get stuck in my teeth which I can't have when I'm already having a hard time sucking in air during my runs.I would gladly eat these over gummy bears since they are made of organic ingredients that are healthier than those used in gummy bears, but I'm sticking with my Honey Stingers for my fruit chews during long runs. The Honey Stingers truly last for the hour that is indicated on each bag, and they are much softer so they don't get stuck in my teeth.Hope this helps someone out there. Cheers!"
5,Tastes good and healthy at the same time,"I liked these so much that I bought a second batch a couple weeks after the first one. They're basically a ""healthy"" gummy bear kind of food. I'm sure they're not the healthiest thing you can eat, but they're healthier than most quick breakfast foods, and they taste good, but they're really not that sweet.I usually eat them for breakfast on the way to work. I usually eat bars like Cliff Bars for breakfast, but this is something different to shake things up. I'll be buying them again, too."
2,Read the Nutritional Facts section,"These taste yummy, but they are just an organic source of sugar. There's no fiber and there's no nutritional benefit. It's a whole lot smarter to eat some dried fruit."
2,"just okay, prefer other brands","I bought the Sharkies because the ingredients (while still basically just sugar) were more wholesome than most other sports chews. I won't buy Sharkies again, though, because they are so darn sticky. Both my daughter and I tried them and they were so sticky our jaws stuck together and the chews didn't melt near as well as other brands I've tried. I do appreciate that there are no fake ingredients, but with a product like this, there has to be ease of use for a repeat purchase. We will finish them, but preferHoney Stinger Organic Energy Chews, Pink Lemonade, 1.8-Ounces Bags (Pack of 12)instead because they aren't as stiff and waxy asClif Shot Bloks, Strawberry, Pack of 18(thereby quicker to eat on the run and quicker to digest in the stomach without random gooey pieces stuck between our teeth). I don't need to pull out a tooth or flash a chunky grin with a product that's supposed to be supporting me!"
4,good tasting chews,"These chews taste good and do have the electrolytes you need when you you are hiking on a hot day. They do get sticky, but so do I when out on a hike."
3,"Very very sticky-chewy, but great flavor!","I ordered these for my 3-year old, who eats an organic diet. They look just like fruit snacks, but are on the large size. I cut them in half, which is no easy feat. They are very dense and chewy. They are very nicely flavored, however, and although they seem to stick a little to his teeth, my son loves them!"
3,"Cute and tasty, not very healthy, though.","We love the strong flavor compared to gummi items, but without many healthy benefits like some other chewy candy. They are chewy, some of the flavors are better than others (watermelon is addictive in a strange, slightly artificial off-tasting way). I cannot address sports related use, we just use them for road trips and picnics. They are too expensive to eat just to be eating something. At least they are organic, they get an extra star for that!"
1,Cannot play it,"I am pretty sure that,if the cd was working, it is very good, but mine starts on the story number 9. It does not matter where I try playing the cd , it always starts on number 9 and there are only 10 stories. I need another cd."
3,Not what I was looking for,Bedtime stories was disappointing to me. She read the stories fairly fast and it just didn't relax me and put me to sleep. This one goes in the don't work pile.
5,"If Clarissa doesn't put you to sleep, nothing will","I mean that in a good way, of course. She has a soothing voice and knows well how to read her own work (which I cannot say of all authors who read their own material on audiobook format). I am bias as I don't think Clarissa has written anything less than a 5."
2,Better than Kryptonite--but gets rusty in rain.,"I really like that you don't have to use a key to get it to lock on. It just ratchets closed. It remains to be seen if the rubber coating will break down like it did on my previous Kryptonite lock. It does take a little extra time to get it to fit over a tire, frame and bike rack, so I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. Usually I am in a hurry and just slap it on the rack and frame since I don't have quick release tires. UPDATE: Since I wrote this review my bike has been outside in the winter rain and it has rusted so that it doesn't close without extra man power and jiggling. I am going to replace it with a cable combo lock, since my bike is so old I doubt anyone would steal it."
3,Heavy and not too sure how secure,"Not sure about this lock. It feels sturdy and works well, but it is beastly heavy and I am not certain it is really any different or better than other locks. A couple of the plastic bits fell off the first day I had it and that didn't make me feel too good about the product. Still, it locks the bike and it hasn't been stolen yet, so I guess it is ok."
1,Very Dissatisfied,This carrier is the worst. I felt like I was carrying a 2 year old instead of my 2 month old! It pulled on the back of my neck as soon as I put my son in it and gave me the worst backache I have ever had. I packed it back up and returned it right away. I definitely would not recommend it.
2,Great saftey wise but not that good for mommie,I registered for this carrier because with my oldest daughter (8) I had their previous model. I have to say while this carrier is easy to use and definetly very safe and the price is great it's hurts a lot to use. The carrier has a support belt for behind the neck. While it's nicely padded it tends to distribute a great deal of the weight on your neck. My son is seven pounds and very small. I used it for ten minutes and my neck was killing me when I got home. They need to go back to the way that their previous model was made where the support belt was around your waist. I will be exchanging this one.
2,Not a good buy,While I really do not like to complain about products this one was not good purchase. It really hurt the back of my neck I exchanged it for another carrier. The price is very affordable but the comfort is not there while carrying your baby.
1,It hangs on my NECK,"I liked the molded seat of this carrier and the ease with which it went on. However, once my son was born and I actually used it, I found it was no good. All of my son's weight hung around my neck. I adjusted this thing at least 5 different times and I still couldn't get the weight off my neck. Unfortunately I had already thrown the box away so I'm stuck with it. However, I was able to borrow my neighbor's Snugli carrier, and problem solved. My son is now over 12# and I can carry him for hours in that."
1,Learn from our mistake!,"I thought the unique strap design and firmer carrier would be perfect, but this thing was AWFUL! I had my 9 lb baby in it for less than a minute when my shoulders started aching. Also, my daughter, who usually melts like butter when in a carrier, started squirming around as though she were uncomfortable. It's too hard and thick and HORRIBLE! Don't believe the smiling woman on the box!"
1,Neck Traction,"Disappointed, no instructions for use. Was suppose to be a 3-pound weight but instead was an empty bag. I returned the product."
3,Simple Entertainment,If you are thinking of getting Meteos - consider getting this instead. I find it relaxing and easy to do.
4,msgamer,Lots of fun. A portable version of a game that keeps the challenges coming in serveral versions. If you like the traditional puzzle games this is great one!
4,fun for all ages,"I bought myself a DS and a few games. Super collapse 3 was one of the first games I bought since it was around $15 on Amazon and looked fun.The focus is to match up the like color blocks/balls before the sides mash together on the screen. The farther you get, the harder the levels. I was pretty addicted and could play for an hour or two-or until I had to stop because my husband was getting annoyed. I never bet the game-the last level was pretty hard. Eventually I traded my DS and games in for a Wii. But I have to say I miss the DS and the inexpensive games like this one. Super Collapse stayed in my DS for a long time and I had fun playing. I would recommend it to teens as well as adults who want a game that will keep them playing for a while."
3,OK,This was a game for my grand- daughther and she said it was OK but wasn't really thrilled. Just a game to pass the time away.
3,Super Collapse 3,It's a fun game and quite challenging but it doesn't allow you to save your progress and therefore you have to start over at the beginning every time. It gets boring going through the less challenging stages over and over.
3,it coudl be better,"it's good for time killing is not going to make you smarter or anything but i will keep you busy for a bit. but you have to make sure you ds is well calibrated because if it's it will seen like the game is at fault but is actually the ds, but since i have two of them it was ok."
4,It is a fun game but is better for computers or laptops.,"I always loved collapse, been playing it for a long time. I decided to give it a try in the Nintendo Ds format. I must say I was dissapointed. I think this game was made in order to be play in the computer. Smaller screens like the DS or PSP make the game hard to enjoy and play. I would recommend the game to anyone but the PC version."
4,Addictive !,"I wasn't sure I would like this game but now that I've played it, it is one of those games that you can't put down.The Quick Play is alot of fun, the puzzles are a GREAT way to get the brain thinking!!!"
2,Direction booklet no help,"This game came with an English language game card but the instruction booklet was written in French. Can't find an address to contact for an English language booklet. If the instructions on the card were clearer, I might really enjoy this game as I am old and new to gaming. I can't seem to understand what to do so I only do Quick Play. I have reached level 13 and can't figure it out."
3,Faulty closures!! Do not recommend.,"These skates do not allow much fun because every time my son gets going they come undone. The buckles(closures)do not stay shut. He cannot wear them at all because of this, I am constantly closing the buckles. I was so excited about getting these for him for christmas, and I turned out getting him a pair of the fisher price my first skates. I recommend if your childs foot will still fit in the fisher price my first skates to get those because these are not worth it. I was very disappointed in these because I like the look a lot more, than the fisher price my first skates, but oh well, the fisher price work better, and I have to go with that.I hope this helps."
1,A toy not a learning tool,"I was not pleased with this product. My son enjoys skating, but did not like the feel of these skates. The skates were uncomfortable. He was not able to learn how to in-line skate using this product."
4,Jargar cello G string,"The Jargar G string is a very nice ""quality"" cello string.I am currently using it on 3 cellos and they have a nice even predictable sound that makes my cellos sing. Not too loud and not too soft, this string will give you a nice tone that we all need for orchestra or solo use. I also like the sound for chamber music as it matches the sound and volume of the other members of our group.Cost is also reasonable compared to Spirocore."
2,Lotus SmartSuite 9.8 Millenium Edition,"Does not work well with windows 7, the original millenium release does work with windows 7, don't know why this one was released"
4,Very nice,These car mats fit perfectly in our Infinity G35. We are very happy with this purchase. Standard delivery came very quickly (as usual with our previous Amazon experience).
5,all edited and weightless,"The first, and the last two tracks can be found in ""Beneath These Fireworks"", in different versions, but ""Princess"" and ""Fall to Pieces"" make this CD a must for every fan.""Fall to Pieces"", as atypical as it is for Matt Nathanson, is still loveable and harmonic.""Princess"" is, in my opinion, one of his best songs so far.So, yeah, for what it is - this CD is just terrific, and Matt Nathanson is a brilliant artist."
5,great product,A Must if you have a pond or a fountain. Will purchase again. came in good timing as well. follow instructions and it works well
5,It works!,"I used this algaecide on the outdoor fountain. The fountain is about 6-8 gallons big. Although the instructions on the bottle indicate the amount in drops, I poured in a cap full. After the 1st week, the improvement is small, so I used another cap full of the liquid. I checked on the fountain the 2nd week, all the green stuff is gone! I like the way that it's bird and animal safe."
2,Packaging was poor,Packaging was poor since half the bottle had leaked.The product worked for our fountain but I wish Amazon pays some attention to the packing of such liquids.
3,Average product for its cost.,"Given the cost, I expected this product to work well and fast. It did neither. I am continuing my search for a more effective product."
1,McGrayel Algaecide,"I had a horrible experience with this product. It made matters worse for me instead of helping. The algae in my pond must have thrived on this stuff because the algae grew worse. It needs to state that this stuff is a poison and where they come up with the idea that it's not hazardous is BS! If you have pets, don't use this stuff in a pond. My cat became very ill and the vet told me that the cat appears to have been poisoned. She had been using my pond as her water bowl without me knowing it. My lab loves to go in the pond without me looking and after having a $1200 vet bill (for the cat) there was no way that I was going to take a chance. I emptied the pond, cleaned it and sent this stuff back."
5,no complaints,Does great .....it is very strong make sure not to use to much ...will be very dark..... but I can actually feel the difference in temp
4,Too many single versions,"I hate edits and this disc has too many of em. Also it's missing 'Kisses Don't Lie', it's a liscensing thing so its forgivable. Besides those two faults this does a good job of assembling her best. The first 10 songs are pure gold, except 'Let's Get Funky Tonight'. Those tracks are some straight up jams. Tracks 11 through 18 aren't as good as the first but are still good. The best are 'Your Personal Touch', 'High Horse', Shake Down' and 'Out Of Control'. If you can find them, get the albums 'I'm In Love' and 'Get Loose' in addition to this."
4,Missing Two Great Hits!!,"Unfortunately this compilation does not include her two smash hits, ""Kisses Don't Lie"" and ""You Can Turn Me On."" If you are an Evelyn King fan, I am certain you would enjoy these two missing and completely off the hook tracks. Meanwhile I will keep searching until I find them."
5,Great Laptop Sleeve,"This product has performed its duties well, over 3 years and still going. It has not faded or frayed, or fallen apart in any way despite daily use. It provides an excellent & snug fit to any appropriately sized laptop."
2,not really happy,"+: my G4 466Mhz, Digital Audio now can use HD's larger than 128GB and boot without problems from this controller-: my G4 won't wake up from system sleep/energy saving, a restart is requiredthe HD's connected to the controller are not recognized by DiskWarrior 3.03, so they can't be repaired with this utilityno firmware upgrade from the manufacturer can be found"
3,Incorrect Pricing,"This book does not cost $69.00. It's been this way for years. I bought the book a couple of years ago and it was less than $25.00. I'm surprised someone hasn't said something to Amazon by now. I remember that I mentioned the incorrect price when I bought the book at Borders. Evidently, they didn't bother to pass the information on to Amazon. I hadn't realized the price was still incorrect until someone mentioned it on a list I'm on. Yeesh!The book is okay. It's the same as what used to be on the official Andromeda site. So all episodes are given a blurb and there are some other nice details and pictures."
5,Great read for the Andromeda fan,"If your an Andromeda fan, then this is the book for you. Unfortunately only goes into the first two seasons otherwise good book."
3,Broke in the peg box after a few days,"I love the Jargar D on my cello, but this one broke soon after I strung it up, so I couldn't give it more than ""it's ok"". I was turning the peg when it happened. Such is life. You have to love it even when it is just ok."
3,Book Ok-But Kind Of Gross!!!,"This book was kind of good, Imean it was good, but it was kind of gross!!! They talked about some things that I can not share with you! You will have to read this book for yourself!!!!! I give this book a rating of 3 stars because once again it was good, but gross!!!"
5,Perfect Pan,"Have used this many times over many years. Regularly use it in my fireplace. Add ingredients, cover with coals, wait a short time, remove, and enjoy. Makes the best stews I've ever eaten."
5,Good basic foundation for buying a first home,"Found the book informative and provides ""nuts and bolts"" about buying a first home. Reduces stress level considering all information bombarded with, at rapid rate. Anything that will facilitate the ""big"" purchase is a ++++."
4,Good smaller halogen for the range hood,"Thanks to other reviewer Seth for mentioning that this bulb fit into his Broan range hood.Exactly the hood I have, and they do fit.My original halogens were 2"" wide at the lens. These are 2 3/4"" wide, but they did go in (a little snug).Amazon and Sylvania need to do a much better job of telling us shoppers specs like that on their products. Too much guesswork otherwise.Hope this helps."
5,Sylvania #14700 50-watt PAR20 wide flood halogen bulb,"The bulb arrived in a somewhat slow manner - about 7 business days - but it was in good shape. It works great. I wrote the date installed on it and when it burns out, I'll have a much more informed review to provide. As of today, no complaints."
3,Always read fine print!!!,Bulb was alot smaller than I thought. One was broke inside bubble wrap.Cost versus light output over-all expense was more than local stores andthere you see what you are getting.
4,Better Than Expected,"These bulbs work very well for recessed lighting applications, such as in a china cabinet. Even if they are not quite as stubby as standard incandescent verions, they still look attractive, and the lighting is superior."
4,It does the job!,"I bought this for my husband to keep his XBOX 360 stuff organized. It's a tight fit with the 360 since the case was designed for the original XBOX. He can fit the unit, two controllers and a bunch of his games in the case. He appreciated that I bought him something for XBOX 360 and I appreciate not having to see a bunch of his stuff scattered around the TV. It was a win-win."
4,Convenience Has Never Been So Sweet,"G-Pak Xbox Organizer and Travel Case is is not only convenient, but compact. It's big enough to hold about two controllers and all connector cables. Not only that, but you can compact close to twenty games in the sleeve compartment. It's great for travel, being big enough to check. If you're protective over your Xbox as I am, it also doubles as a carry-on, fitting snugly in all under-seat storage areas. Upon arrival at your destination, you can easily set up your system without ever removing your Xbox. The back/bottom of the case opens for the sole purpose of cable connectivity. The only drawback to this accessory is its underabundance of storage capacity for vital accessories. Four controllers simply refuse to squeeze in there, let alone all necessary cables. If your an anti-social gamer, great. But for all you socials, you better bring a plastic bag for additional accessories. Overall, it's a best-buy."
4,Good Storage Case for your old Console,I grabbed one of these back around Thanksgiving when I was packing up my consoles to make room for guests. Just by looking at the picture you can tell that the case is somewhat stiff.It turns out the thing is nearly solid all the way around. This is great for storage purposes but kind of makes travel a bit inconvenient.If you've upgraded to an XBox 360 or other next-gen console and are looking to retire your old XBox this will provide a great resting place.
2,Could Be Bigger !!!,"Nice console case, but there isn't enough room to place the controllers. It's REALLY HARD to put them inside!. However the box is hard enough to protect your console, and it looks beautiful."
2,Disappointed in Wusthof Poultry Shears,"I need to cut up 30-40 pounds of chicken backs at a time, and these shears do the job better than my Cutco kitchen shears. However, they came with no care instructions or any other paperwork, and they are a nuisance to take apart to clean thoroughly. It is not easy to adjust them again after putting the spring back in and replacing the screw. I have been putting a drop of olive oil in the spring assembly after washing and drying them thoroughly by hand, but I certainly expected some information to come with a pair of relatively expensive shears. There is no information on the box, either. The handles are smooth and slippery, and it is sometimes difficult to maintain a secure grip when cutting through bone. It would be easy to slip and remove a fingertip! I would not recommend buying these and will continue to look for a more satisfactory pair, which I will not purchase online. I'll want to see them before investing more money in poultry shears."
2,poor design,"As a positive, these shears cut through bone with relative ease. However, I found the handle very difficult to grip- it opens too widely and my hand often slips off of the ""pebbled"" handles. I do not have small hands and am surprised at the design as I have many other Wusthof knives and am satisfied with them all. I actually find my Wusthof regular kitchen shears to be much easier to hold on to while cutting chicken. These shears are probably not worth the money unless you have unusually large hands."
3,Double album from Orange Goblin,"Very nice, polished sound,a surprisingly melodic album for a group of retro-metal artists. Reminds me of the best of metallic '60s and '70s like Steppenwolf and Black Sabbath, with Styx-like lyrics. Not just a knock-off, though; takes this sound in directions it might have gone had the era lasted a bit longer. Quite recommended."
3,Couldn't tell a bit of difference,"I added this stuff and it didn't help or hurt my transmission. I can't give it 5 stars because it didn't help anything. I can't give it 0 stars because it didn't hurt anything but my wallet, so I give it a 3 because 3 is in between."
3,Great for piano and acoustic guitar but did not work well with Driverack,"Disappointed when using this mic with the RTA/auto eq feature of the Driverack PA. Everytime I ran the wizard, it would generate a different EQ curve which actually made my speakers sound worse. I experimented with other mics I have and found that the Crown PZM mic works the best out of everything I have--much better than the DBX mic.However, when I used the DBX mic for recording, I was very impressed. Sounds great on piano, acoustic guitar, and vocals (with a pop screen). Great mic for recording for the price."
2,The channel knife quest continues...,"I have a bunch of Rösle products and most are VERY high quality - a MUST buy is their cocktail shaker. This just really misses the mark. It gouges too deep into the citrus to allow a smooth long peel. Maybe the angle on the cutting 'V' is too steep, or the cutting metal is too thick. Bottom line - it sucks. I think I'll try the Trudeau one next. It has great reviews and it is a LOT cheaper."
4,An interesting history lesson,"This is a very interesting history lesson about American meals over the last hundred years. While some chapters are more interesting than others, the book as a whole provides a glimpse into kitchens of the last century."
3,"""modify"" ""adapt""... what for???","Some of the history here was interesting.... although she drones on and on about Eleanor Roosevelt's unqualified housekeeper... and is as boring and repetitive as that lady's meals were reputed to be....but why on earth would you modify or adapt a recipe in what is essentially a history book... when the whole point is how people used to cook....for anyone who is really interested in the topic, it would probably make more sense to read the sources from the thoughtfully annotated bibliography.... than to read this book.either this author is naturally boring herself, or she had to write this book to get a promotion at the library where she works... and gets to handle all the luscious originals...maybe this is all unfair... but i was quite disappointed by this book."
1,"Not a ""Happy Cooker""",Loved the slow cooker until the dial and handle cracked and fell off. It appeared the outside covering became too hot and caused the problem. I'm looking for something that will last a little longer.
3,Problem with handles,Although I have no complaints about cooking in this crockpot - everything turns out just fine - both handles cracked and fell off. Makes it difficult to transport food to other locations.
3,My Grandkids Loved it!,"I ordered this and another Fred Gwynne book for my grandchildren because I was fascinated by the fact that he wrote them. I was very disappointed with them when they arrived. I went ahead and gave them to my granddaughter while she was visiting me. She sat on the porch and read both to me and laughed her head off! She said, ""I love these books! They are so funny!"" She had to have a few explanations because of the dating of the books...Viet Nam conflict era, but that didn't faze her. What do I know? She and her brother love and enjoy them both. Buy them for your kids!"
2,Old school & out of date,"I thought this would be a good addition to my son's classroom library (grade 2) but it is very old & has references to ""guerrilla warfare"" and ""the arms race"" --- the homophones used in this book are over the head's of this generation's readers. I love vintage children's books, but this just leaves a kid scratching his head."
4,Needed more,"Liked the book, my only complaint was that it would have given more to explain the various names. It was good otherwise."
5,"Excellent book, but needs updating.","Mr. Stone has a sincere respect for God and His personal/descriptive Names in the OT and NT. Since it was written in 1944, much new manuscript information has come to light. For example, the personal Name of God has been found to be Yahweh by most Christian scholars. Jehovah has been determined to be incorrect, being formed by adding the Vowel points of Adonai to the Tetragrammaton, YHWH. This was done to keep from offending the traditionalist Jews who thought it too sacred to pronounce, and even the newest Bible translations use LORD in place of the personal Name of God, YHWH (Yahweh). Since LORD is a title, and not a name, I believe that we should use our God's real personal Name Yahweh in our translations and in our prayers."
3,"Good, but not great","I was really hoping this would be a great book, unfolding some of the deep mysteries about the Lord's revelation of who He is. (I was surprised at how tiny the book actually is.) It is a good read, but falls a little short of my expectations."
4,"Good movie, weak ending",I like this film. A male cinderella story that was marred slightly by the political ending. The film would have ended better leaving off with just the Robson Green character's transformation. I thought the Prince's learned nothing and was nothing more than incidental. Will be ordering more Robson Green. He is a wonderfully charismatic actor.
4,Easy Fun,"Robson Green and Rupert Penry Jones are a delightfully mismatched couple. The Prince is something of a dim bulb, but turns out the bodyguard (Green) is just the intellectual. moral, and ethical help Prince may need. Dislike: Tara Fitzgerald; then again, fairly easy to look past her. It's easy, ""slow day"" viewing."
2,so-so movie/romance,"This is just a so-so movie. There are so many better produced romance movies from England such as Bridget Jones, North and South the miniseries, the recent adaption of Emma or Pride and Prejudice. Unless you are a major fan of the actors in this movie, skip it and buy something else."
4,1500 mah?,"I bought this because it is 1500 mah instead of the regular home depot on which may1200 or 1300 mahHowever, there is no way I can confirm this one is better.HomeDepot has it for $50 for 2 ($25 for one) which can be cheaper.Based on model number and no indiction of 1500 mah,I think this is the same one as HomeDepot Unless I open it up."
2,"Decent tools, poor batteries","I bought a set of Ryobi tools, as household/garage/farm tools. The tools themselves are decent, no Makita or Panasonic for sure, but decent.Big problem, these batteries are near worthless. Circular saw, one 24"" cut and its toast. Drill? 10 holes max, impact driver, 6 holes max, and you are done with any useable power. Seems like all I do is change batteries, and I have 4 of them.For: Construction/Framing use, worthles / Busy homeowner, somewhat adequate / housewife, here are your tools, just be prepared for a lot of charging.Ryobi tools are decent, for the money, but if you can, by any means necessary, buy a real set of cordless tools, do it. Ryobi is just a stop gap, till you can replace them."
4,18V Ryobi Battery,Received the product on time and so far it is operating as expected. Just now to see how long it lasts.
1,Grossly over priced,"Thought I was getting a 2 pack, turned out to be just 1 battery. You can get a 2 pack at Home Depot for less than $50. Go there!!!"
1,Very poor battery life,"I got sold on the concept after getting a drill/flashlight kit - then went on to purchase a string trimmer, a hedge trimmer and a leaf blower. All items functioned well initially for the price paid, but none of the batteries would hold a charge after less than a year of light use and with very few charging cycles. It is a shame that Home Depot would put these products on the market with this major design defect. They have probably spent millions on the development and marketing the product line, so why would they not keep their customers happy with a battery upgrade or replacement program under warranty?"
4,ryobi drill battery,I use this battery for my cordless saw and it works great when cutting 4 x 8 sheets of plywood.
4,Good Pricing - Orig Equipment for older units,The decision was whether or not to by new screw-guns to get new batteries - which used to be about the same price as just the battery. We got the batteries for 1/3 the price we paid the last time -- 2006 --- we bought (4) this time - great pricing for OEM !! Fast & Free Shipping.... Couldn't do much better.
5,Simple Lean Manufacturing Implementation,There are several methods of implementing Lean Manufacturing Practices in a Factory. I have found the 20 Keys method to be the easiest and still broad enough to be effective. The lowest score is 20 and the maximum score is 100. You are guaranteed a doubling of productivity with each 10 points. Go for it!
5,this is the world class journey!,"This is probably the finest book of the world class journey ever written, not in theory, but the things we have to do to keep on the journey. Prof Kobayashi brings to light the 20 different skills in a broad perspective that any organization can use effectively to make the journey possible. To truly understand the subtle secrets you will eventually read this book 20 times. You will be so inspired by the graphics you will go to Japan to find the deep rooted meanings of the content, as the processes behind them (2o keys) are a culture in their own right! Enjoy your personal world class journey by starting with yourself!!!"
4,Good pen but they need a wider selection of refills.,"I purchased this pen as a gift for a friend who is going back to college this summer. So far he loves the pen. It writes smooth, crisp, and clean. He likes the gel ink, but he would prefer a more traditional ink cartridge. He doesn't mind using the ink, but we were both confused as to why this pen supports gel ink ballpoint, felt tip, and a highlighting marker refill but cannot accommodate a traditional ink refill as well.Overall it's a great pen. Durable, writes well, and looks amazing. I would have given it 5 stars if they made traditional ink fine point refills for the pen. Given the wide range of refills available I'm sure it wouldn't be too hard for them to do this."
3,Just ok,Reviews seem a little over hyped after using this product. Nothing special about it. Will keep looking for a better product.
4,a multidimensional challenge,"What is a peer competitor? At one level, the US is looking for another Soviet Union. The phrase refers to a nation that might emerge decades hence as a credible military challenge to the US. But, and here is the crux, it is not just in the military arena. Think of it as a multidimensional challenge - economic, cultural as well as military.The book also suggests ways that a dominant state, which it helpfully labels as the hegemon, might anticipate the rise of a peer competitor, and how it might choose to try to forestall this rise. ""The most fundamental problem a hegemon faces is how to remain one"". These options are analysed in summary form.No mention is made of who the hegemon or the proto-peers might be. Though you can certainly guess that the former is the US."
1,No Margaritas,"Purchased on Consumer Reports review. First one arrived with a hole punched in the motor housing. Second one burned up after the second batch of 'ritas. Buyers, stay away!"
1,Great blender ... for 3 weeks,"Like many of the other reviewers, I have suffered from the broken plastic teeth problem. My blender lasted 3 weeks of use (frozen fruit + crushing ice 3-5 times a week) until the motor started to slip. I looked under the jar and found that 3 out of the 6 plastic teeth had broken off.Disregard the Consumer Reports reviews, especially the one that said this problem was fixed by the manufacturer. It has not. If you are going to use this blender for anything remotely solid, it will break in a very short amount of time."
2,Very Disappointed - gear broken,"I am so disappointed in this blender. I spent a lot of time researching before and bought this on Amazon a year ago and judging from the reviews, it was a sturdy blender. I didn't use it much to begin with but recently started doing smoothies with it. In less than 4 weeks of this, once of the gear teeth has already snapped off. It works still but I don't expect it will last - why can't they make metal gears? While you can buy replacements, I don't intend to spend more money after bad and will look at going up a notch. Good blender, just don't plan on doing any heavy duty ice crushing/smoothie type of blending."
5,For users having trouble with broken gear teeth,"Many reviewers of this product have complained about broken plastic gear teeth--a problem I too experienced within a few weeks of using my new blender. I returned the broken blade assumbly to a Braun authorized service center for repair under warranty. A repair technician at the service center told me the broken teeth were caused by the way I was using the blender with frozen ingredients. The service tech told me to use this procedure: Put all the non-frozen ingredients into the jar, put the jar cover on, place it on the motor base, and turn on the blender to any speed. While the blender is on, remove the cap that covers the opening in the lid, and pour or drop frozen ingredients into the jar, continuing to blend until finished."
1,MUCH TOO FRAGILE,"The tiny plastic teeth, on the underside of blades, break off if you look at them wrong. I replaced the blade assembly, and they assembly broke the very first time I tried to use it."
4,Jug Blender,"Extremely pleased with this product. I use my blender every morning for my protein shakes and feel as though this meets my needs in blending my fruits, whey protein, milk, flaxseed meal and ice into a smooth drink."
1,Braun MX2050 PowerMax Jug Blender -- major disappointment,"The Braun MX2050 PowerMax Jug Blender has the following issues:(1) the blade assembly must be screwed **extremely** tightly to the jug to prevent leakage -- so tightly it is difficult to unscrew for cleaning(2) one of the blade assembly gear teeth, that engage the motor base, has broken after only a few months of use (~ 5 times per week)I really have nothing good to say about this product -- too bad there is not a zero-star rating."
1,Broke first day,Opened up the box of my Braun MX2050 Blender today for the first time .It broke on the first attempt .No more Braun products for me !
1,Very cheaply made,"I needed a new blender and based on reviews I was excited to get this one. I make smoothies almost every day. I put all the ingredients in, turned it on and the blades were spinning but not pulling the mixture down. I had to open the jar and ""help"" stir the mixture around. Soon after, I smelled a burning odor. That burning smell is there every time I use the blender regardless of the speed I choose. There has got to be a better choice out there for $50!"
1,buyer beware,"I would like to give some good advice to any potential buyers...do not buy this blender. I saw the concerns at this site, but went ahead and purchased the blender based on Consumer Report's advice. A mistake... I learned. After using the blender only 5 times (making smoothies) the motor lost some power (the low gears didn't work). After a 1 hour round trip drive to Braun's nearest repair shop, the blender did not function any beter. Braun wanted me to return the blender AGAIN for repair! After several calls, long hold times on the phone, a check eventually was sent to refund my money (after I had to pay to ship the blender back to them!). I hope you learn by my mistake."
3,"Blender breaks, otherwise I like it!","I bought this blender because of good reviews on Consumer Reports and other sites, and bought it specifically to make food for my baby (as well as other uses). It worked very well for about 6 months, but then the white plastic piece at the base of the pitcher melted while I was blending on on high speed. I should note that making baby food requires blending/grinding grains and dried legumes on high for up to 2 minutes, but my baby food book says that blenders are designed to withstand this kind of work. I was disappointed. I did find that I could order a replacement piece (Amazon had it at the cheapest price overall), but I was not happy to spend more than expected on the blender."
2,Braun 5 speed Power Max Jug Blender,"This blender got an excellent rating in one of my magazines, but I wasn't impressed. It does not do a good job with drinks requiring ice. Just doesn't seem to handle ice chips well at all, I was very disappointed, but what do you expect only paying around 40.00 for a blender. I've already replaced it with a Vita Mix, which is so much better."
4,Braun PowerMax Blender,Does everything we've asked it to do and matches up well with the product evaluations we read that caused us to buy it in the first place.
5,Consumer Reports was Right,"I read in Consumer Reports that this blender was great and they were correct. I wanted a machine to do one thing well, crush ice. All previous blenders were not up to the task, but the Braun is. A great buy!"
1,Great Performance. Horrible Maintenance. Price range the issue?,"This must be a tricky product to review. There is a ton of chatter on the MX2050. Half of it raves about performance. Half of it moans about maintenance. I'll confirm both. I loved the performance of my MX2050 for the less-than-a-year that I could tolerate its repeated maintenance problems.I bought the MX2050 because of the performance reviews, and I ignored the chatter about maintenance because Braun had recently ""fixed these problems"". Well, they didn't. I've replaced broken parts every 2 or 3 months, until this month when the little black coupling melted, rendering the unit unreparable.Apparently, the MX2050 is the best product in its price range. If you like fixing broken stuff, then buy it. I'm tired of it now, so I'll be trying the Waring Professional Bar Blender that costs 3 times as much but has excellent reviews and a good maintenance track record over its longer history. Wish me luck!"
1,how to get an improved replacement part,"I experienced the same disappointment as many others after discovering the shattered teeth at the bottom of the gear assembly. Today on the Consumer Reports website I found this number: 800-272-8611 for Braun Customer service. Call the number, do not choose any of the menu options and wait for a customer service rep. They'll send you an improved blade and gear assembley in 7 to 10 days. I just ordered it, so I can't comment on it's durability. They were very apologetic. Good luck."
2,Good performance but broke after 2 years,"Worked well for 2 years then all the sudden motor quit working. Only used lightly (maybe once every two weeks).Two design flaws:1) the clear cap at the top doesn't seal well and liquid will leak out the top when you first blend something and it splashes at the top.2) The plastic teeth that connect the blade with the motor assemble are brittle and eventually break. After 2 years, 3 of the six were broken off.At least the blender is relatively inexpensive."
2,Obvious Design Flaw,"I like the blender, but after reading many other reviews (after I purchased) with the same problem it seems that Braun has a real quality control issue. After only 3 weeks of normal use, the plastic teeth on the underside of the blade started breaking. Within another 2 days my new blender was as useful as an anchor! I have been waiting for a replacement part from Braun for 4 weeks, and according to my call with them this morning, it will be another 2 weeks before I might see it. Wish I had not thrown out my 15 year old blender so quickly."
1,Poor engineering,"The white plastic teeth and plastic drive mechanism are truly a bad design. Have sent back three of these blenders, and finally gave up. Two had broken white teeth, and one of those had a motor ""grinding"" sound like it was under a load it couldn't handle. The third had broken white teeth and the black plastic drive mechanism the teeth fit into on the base also broke off. Did not put any of these machines under difficult stress, but was mixing smoothies, with frozen fruit pieces. Added the ingredients slowly, and if the motor started to accelerate, stopped the machine, added more liquid, and resumed. But, each of these machines tolerance for significant frozen loads was really grim. Consumer Reports really got this item wrong, wrong, wrong. Our $15.00 blender from WalMart works better!!!"
1,Poor Quality,"Thinking that I was buying a very powerful blender, it being over 500 watts. I decided to get this more expensive $60 model. To my suprise a $12 blender would have been a much better purchase since I wouldn't have expected much from it. I used this blender possibly 1 week making only one smoothie each morning. It burned the motor up in just a week even though I blend the fruit first and then the ice a little at a time. This was a waste of money, you would be much better off with the $12 model."
3,Part Breaks - very poor customer service - now zero stars,I bought the unit less than six months ago and have replaced the plastic teeth (on the base of the jug) twice. I am still waiting for re-designed part which was promised last month.
3,Worked great until it broke,"I bought this blender after reading reviews here, the Consumer Reports reviews, and the updated information that the problem with the plastic gear teeth had been fixed. Not. My blender worked perfectly with moderate (3-4 times per week) use and did a wonderful job making smoothies and pureeing soups. It's easy to clean and easy to assemble. After 5-1/2 months, one of the plastic gear teeth snapped off. I phoned Braun and was promised a replacement part in 10 business days. I'm hoping for a long life for the replacement part, but if the blender breaks again and it's no longer under warranty, I will invest in a model with metal gear teeth."
1,Twice broken,"I wondered if my blender was an aberration, but after reading that others had the same problems with theirs, I realized that the little plastic gears that turn the blade are not strong enough to handle the pressure. The blender worked wonderfully until the gears broke off. I ordered a replacement part from a company in New York. Within a short time, the gears started to break off again. I quit using the blender."
2,Cheap Plastic Gear Teeth Break!,"Now ask yourself...Why would a manufacturing produce one of the most critical, rotating parts out of plastic, rather than steel? Buyer beware! The gear teeth underneath the METAL blade are made of CHEAP PLASTIC. I wish I had read the Consumer Report on this one in 2004. The gear teeth broke off within a year. If you are looking for a blender that will last a while, don't get this one. Ugh."
2,Braun Blender: Works great... when it works,"Like most everyone else, I experienced a broken plastic drive tooth (still worked though) with my blender and also noticed that speeds 1 and 2 seemed to be the same speed.Barring those issues, I really liked how well it blended until this past Thanksgiving weekend. While making my first batch of frozen drinks for guests, it began to smoke. It then slowed down and died.It appears there's a one-year warranty on it as long as I can come up with proof-of-purchase and take it to a service center. I got it as a Christmas gift last year and sure hope my sister saved the receipt!"
2,"Mixes Well, Breaks Easily","The Braun MX 2050 blends most ingredients easily, including semi-dry items, such as dates, in a minimal amount of water. However, the little plastic pieces on the bottom of the blade (under the base) do break off easily, even under normal use."
1,Don't waste your money,"Unfortunately, I bought two of these blenders based on their good reviews in Consumer Reports or Cooks Illustrated--can't remember which. Problems include:- Shape of jar, which makes thick mixes like milkshakes not blend evenly. The blade just spins while the shake stays in place. You have to constantly stop the blender and stir with a wooden spoon.- Burning smell (resulting from the above, I believe).- Five speeds are useless. They're too close together.If these were more expensive, I'd spend the energy to return them. But as it stands, I'll just toss 'em and buy something better. Don't waste your money."
2,Worked great....until it didn't!,"Started out well: Quick, efficient blending and ice crushing, but...after using about 2 1/2 months for daily ice, fruit, whey, yogurt smoothies, the motor fairly quickly began emitting a strong burning smell and shortly thereafter stopped functioning all together. Took to local authorized repair center, but they decided they had to return it to Braun for repairs...in the meantime, the shop went out of business. I've never received any replacement for this unit, but, then again, I rather not have to worry about it failing again. Finally got the KitchenAid Professional Chef's model- finally a machine that actually works consistently."
4,Very powerful,"We got this blender because of the Consumer Reports rating, and the reviews that said it was powerful. It is! Can mix up ice or ice cream easily. Overall has a high quality feel to it. Not too many speeds, but that's fine - who needs seven or eight? Symbols for the various speeds are indecipherable, but we're rather smart so we quickly deduced that ""5"" is faster than ""1"". :) Biggest drawback is the holes at the top the little piece goes into the big cover (why do they make those two pieces anyway?). Hot liquids could come out."
1,"Makes great smoothies, for two weeks only","Consumer Reports rates this as number one for making smoothies, and it is a great blender, sort of. The only problem is its engineering. The connection between the rotors and the powerful motor are all flimsy plastic and break easily. I noticed how thin the plastic connections were when I first upened the box and was apprehensive. Nevertheless it made great smoothies for about two weeks, then when grinding up a banana and some rasberries, the white teflon teeth on the bottom of the rotor broke. If you live in San Antonio, forget warranty repair, it has to go to Corpus Christie. Not! This is a bad product. Poorly engineered and unreliable."
2,Good blender with weak gear teeth,A good basic blender except for the weak plastic coupling teeth used for the blade. A replacement costs about $13 but when you add shipping and tax it ends up costing almost $20. That is almost half the cost of the whole blender.
3,not quite what i expected,"this blender got a great review from cooks magazine, so i bought it without hesitation. however, each time i use it, i have to use a spoon several times to adjust the contents so it will continue to blend instead of burning out. also, the blade assembly looks and feels really cheap and flimsy, like it will break any time."
2,Doesn't seem to be durable,The blender seemed strong but there are problems already. I do smoothies every morning. After less than a month of use part of the plastic gear at the bottom of the jug (that engages the motor) has a piece broken off. I have e-mailed Braun. We'll see what they do. The website doesn't show a replacement for the gear. I does show replacement for the base coupling and gasket...
3,OK blender for the money,"Just getting this blender was difficult. Communications with the company to replace the blender that arrived damaged were not easy. After that got straightened out and I finally received the blender, I initially was impressed with its power and performance. It has been a few months now and we use it 3-4 times a week for smoothies. It leaks frequently from the base assembly. It was a poor idea to make the gasket from plastic instead of rubber. I have to be extremely careful about screwing the base on very tightly. It gets cross-threaded easily. It has also been having some power issues- losing power in the middle of a blend, bogging down at the end of a blend... Not enough that I want to attempt to go through the hassle of returning it though. I will use it until it dies and then buy a different brand next time."
4,Good Value,"""Cooks Illustrated"" had a nice review of this blender and after reading other reviews decided to try it... we had just ""pitched"" a cheap one after 1 use so did not want to waste any more money. So far this one is living up to what I have read."
5,The MX2050 Power Blender,"We use this blender almost every day. For the price that we paid ($35.00) with free shipping, we did not upgrade the shipping method and it still arrived within five days of placing our order. This blender works wonderfully. It makes great smoothies in 30 seconds. I would highly recommend this blender for anyone who doesn't need a $400 blender or want to spend a lot of money. We also like the larger 58 ounce glass jug compared to the majority of other blenders only having a 44 ounce container. As far as the other people complaining about the holes on the top of the lid, although they do seem odd, we haven't had any problems or issues concerning it. It is no big deal. We love the Braun MX2050 PowerMax Jug Blender and we think we may order another one!!!"
3,Great Product but poorly made,"The blender performs very, very well, but is poorly constructed and within the first month or two we had to have it repaired twice. The first repair was the gasket and the second repair was the plastic gear on the bottom of the pitcher. We really do love how it blends, but this could be a very costly blender to use if it continues to break."
3,"Bought based on great review, but was dissappointed!","Well, I had read in Consumer Reports that this blender was great overall for the price so I bought it. Although it did make a great smoothy, which is primarily why I purchased it, the blender often did not sit well in the base and for some reason it would make an terrible grinding noise. I called Braun and they said they had not heard of that problem, but she suggested returning it for another. I thought about that until I read through these reviews once again and found that other people referred to this same grinding noise. So I returned the item, will probably not rebuy and am still searching for another. Well, reading through many other blender reviews, there seems to be no simple answer. The search goes on!"
5,Great blender!,"I've had mine for about a year now and so far so good. I use it mostly for drinks that require crushing ice and as long a there is enough liquid it works beautifully. If there isn't enough then it creates an air pocket around the blade. I just open the lid and stir a little to fix that. Stopping the blender first of course. I have kind of big ice and I think this blender might work better using a smaller cube. All in all, I use this thing a lot and I love the power it has. Especially compared to some of the other blenders on the market."
1,useless for my purposes,"i cook a lot of indian food, and many recipes call for pureeing various spices, chilis, and other vegetables into a paste. this is what i bought this blender to do. much as i love my food processor, it doesn't really turn out a smooth puree, especially with small amounts of material.this blender has failed completely to puree anything. i even tried to make hummus, and all the machine did was thow the ingredients onto the side of the jug and spin the blades uselessly. maybe it would puree a very liquid vegetable soup, but that's not what i bought it to do."
2,unpowerfull...,"I wish I would have looked here before buying it... although I saw some pretty good reveiws... But I havent used it for about half- a year. But when I got it out yesterday to make some orange juice (from the cans that you keep in the freezer) so i made sure it wasnt too thick, it wasnt bad at all, But the blender had the hardest time trying to tear through the chunk of orange surup and water.. after a minute or 2 it lightened up and it turned out fine... for some reason, i had never thought of putting the cans of orange juice in a blender before! It turned out great!"
1,Boy was I disappointed,I ordered the Braun MX2050 Power Max Blender as a gift for my son in law. Because it's a gift I didn't open it but let me tell you how it was delivered. It was not packaged in anything but the box you would find on a store shelf. There was a slice producing a hole through the box that was about 2 inches long and all the way into the box. It was raining out and the item sat in the rain with no protection until the carton was puckered and damaged. I am going to be very embarrassed to give this as a gift.
1,Powerful blender with parts that break,"I don't care what Consumer Reports says, I would strongly discourage anyone from buying this blender. Although it has a strong motor and is easy to clean, I cannot tolerate the fact that the blade part has plastic teeth that hook into the base and these plastic teeth break very easily.After almost all of the teeth snapped out - after normal use - I called Braun and spoke with their customer service person who admitted that this was a design flaw and that they had received many calls about this. He offered to send me a new part. It took three months for them to deliver the part because the demand for replacements was so great!And here I am again a few months later - after very infrequent use, the plastic teeth are snapping off. I am thoroughly disgusted with this product. It is really a shame because it is otherwise a good blender."
1,Very Disappointed,"I was excited to received a highly rater blender, but it did not live up to expectations. First it would not fit well onto the base and I'd have to jiggle it to get it to lock properly - when it didn't fit it would make a terrible grinding noise and only by trial and error would it finally work. Trying to clean it by using the pulse resulted in water and suds all over the place because of openings in the top. Then within a couple of months the plastic bottom pieces broke off and it wouldn't turn. I like to make protein drinks with frozen fruit and one or two ice cubes and this is not the blender to do that with. I do not recommend buying this blender."
1,Save the box!,We bought this blender and it seemed to work great so after about a month I threw the box away. Less than a month later it broke. Each morning we mix up a protein drink similar to a smoothie and evidently this blender cannot handle that much work.
1,Great blender except base,"I ordered this blender because of Consumer Report reviews. The blender seems to have one major flaw - a base with plastic teeth. Although the technical data indicates a sturdy stainless-steel blade, the actual mechanism that controls the blade is made out of plastic and is easily broken. I only used my blender for 2 weeks before it broke, and I am waiting on a replacement at 20% of the original cost (excluding shipping)that I won't receive for 3-4 weeks. I'll be replacing this blender very soon."
2,Beware of this blender,"Blender worked well initially, but coupling between motor and blade, entirely made of plastic, broke apart after two weeks. Braun acknowledges that this is a known design problem that they are trying to remedy, but do not yet have replacement parts or a definite date of when they will be available."
1,MONEY . DOWN . THE . DRAIN . I MEAN BLENDER,"MONEY DOWN THE DRAIN...I MEAN BLENDER. After reading amazon's glowing review I felt this was the perfect replacement for my 20 year old blender. At first it worked great. I even bought one as a gift(big mistake). Once the short warranty period ended my parents told me the one I gave them was making a spinning sound but not blending. I ASSUMED they just didn't take good care of it. But 2 months later when my blender went(I treat mine carefully)... P.S.(Feb.2007)**I have discovered a way to extend the life of ANY blender. Put Liquid in FIRST, Start Blender,Then add Ice Cubes Slowly With Blender Running."
1,There is a major flaw,"I bought this blender because of its high rating and positive reviews. I love the styling, the large jug, and the power. However, the nylon teeth/gears that are turned by the motor are cheaply made and do not last. I made about 6 smoothies before these teeth fell off. Braun replaced the gear unit and on the third smoothie they broke again. I've sent the blender back to Braun and will receive my purchase price. Don't buy this blender if you need to crush ice, frozen fruit, or do other heavy duty blending."
1,This blender still a disappointment with replacement blades,"Like many other users, I love the shape, look, feel and power of this blender...I have used it less than a dozen times for fruit smoothies only...I start with plain yogurt and perhaps half a banana...I then drop in single pieces of cut up frozen fruit...after about 8 uses, half the plastic teeth were broken out...I continued until only one tooth remained. I called Braun and got a ""replacement blade group"" within a week...the rep said this new part had corrected the problem. Not so! I have used the new blade only once and one tooth has broken out.This Braun blender is a big disappointment."
1,I Only Wish There Were a (-1) Rating!,"I purchased this blender because most others in it's price range only had about 350-400 watts of power, so I figured this one has 525watts and should really be able to blend well. WELL, I was beyond wrong! This thing can't even blend a simple smoothie well, let alone anything on a more complicated level. I purchased it because it was inexpensive and it's always good to save a dollar, but you'll be wasting $50.00 if you purchase this blender."
4,Satisfied customer,I have been searching for a blender that actually does crush ice and I think that I have finally found it!! I was determined to find and purchase one of these blenders after reading the reviews on this site. I tracked one down and I am so pleased that this one does the trick. Highly recommended.
1,Big Flaw,This blender has holes in the top of the lid. Liquid flies out whenever you use it. I called Braun USA and they said they don't know why it is designed like this. We returned it. It's a stupid design flaw.
2,Great....When Working!,"I bought this blender for X-mas and all went well for about a month until this evening. When I went to turn the blender on--nothing happened! It won't turn on and I have absolutely no clue why. I was shocked to say the least.I'm not sure if I even want to contact Braun's customer service because of all the negative feedback with them.Note to self, cheap equipment is crap equipment..."
4,fine but not perfect or super strong,"Overall, a good or above average blender, it seems. I am not personally familiar with much blender knowledge, but it works good, better than my previous one (or ones, I think), even a little ""designed"" better too. I think I was warned here about the lid being a bit open to leaks between the lid and the clear plastic opening area. This does turn and ""click"" into place, but at times it is open enough to allow a little liquid out. So, I often use a kitchen rag on top just in case. I especially do it when I do my occasional soap and water blend-clean up afterwards--it even has its own quick clean and or blend mode for those purposes. It works well. I have found though that, since I have only used it for smoothies, it can cough or sputter a bit on frozen fruits. It seems a bit worrisome, so I have resorted to small, careful introduction of the harder ingredients or microwaving stuff."
2,Works well when it works,This blender grinds really well when it works but most of the time it just doesn't work. And for it ever to work I have to push down hard on the top the whole time I'm using it or it won't go on. I've only had it about 2 months and it's been like this since about the 2nd time I used it and now I've used it maybe 7 times. Thinking about sending it back but it's such a hassle to figure out where to send it and package it up etc.
1,"Broken promises, still as of April 2006","Don't buy. The base of this unit breaks due to its cheap plastic design. I am still awaiting my ""free"" replacement part after one month."
2,Braun PowerMax Blender,We bought this blender because it was recommended by Consumer Reports as a very good smoothie blender. We were very disappointed in how it performed and in Consumer Reports' recommendation. It wasn't able to crush regular-sized ice cubes for smoothies. Recently we bought a 600W Cuisinart blender/food processor that does a really nice job with regular-sized ice cubes and the food processor is a nice bonus!
5,changed my life,cooks illustrated was right this blender is as good as my housemate's 400 dollar vita mix--it's fast-- container is wide at the top (easy to pour into or out of)- makes great SMOOTH soups and dressings-
1,Plastic gear teeth broke on 1st use,"I researched the blender and accepted Consumer Reports' recommendation as a ""best buy"". I was wary about the reports of the plastic gear teeth breaking but CR indicated that recent tests were fine. The plastic teeth broke the very 1st time I used it making a smoothie with partially frozen strawberries (not even ice cubes). It did a good job chopping up the strawberries and blending it into a creamy smoothie but getting one use out of it is unacceptable. It's already packed up to be shipped back."
1,Piece of Junk,I bought this blender on the recommendation of both Consumer Reports and Cooks Illustrated. It worked great for about three months of occasional use. Then the gears stopped working. They are plastic! What happened to quality? And the is no Braun customer service on-line- none! Buy something else.
1,Unable to try the item,The blender arrived broken. I was unable to even try it once as nothing happened when I plugged it in and turned it on. Delivery was quick but I felt frustrated in trying to get return information via email. I only got a standard response to my inquiry about where and how to return the item.
4,Good basic choice,"It's rather difficult to choose a blender these days; there are many choices and many with funky features like smoothie blenders with stir rods and other newfangled ideas.The Braun is a plain-Jane blender with five speeds and a pulse mode, which is pretty average in terms of speeds. It has a jug that can go in the dishwasher. It can handle a couple of ice cubes in your smoothies.It is not exciting, is not very high speed (so will not do very dense items or liquify dense items.) But it's a great choice for simple use. Since I use my hand blender (stick blender) for most choices, this is fine for me. The only time I use it is for things that the hand blender seems to leave too chunky for my tastes.If you don't want a big, expensive blender and are willing to accept reasonably basic features, this is a good choice."
2,Different problem than others are having...,"I ordered this blender based on Consumer Rpts & decided to take a chance on the plastic blades. Due to poor packing the plastic base was broken when I received the shipment. It appeared to be caused by the glass container handle rotating in the packing material. Amazon shipped out a replacement within a few days & it too had a broken base. Different place but still cracked with pieces in the box bottom. This time I was told by Amazon that the product obviously has some inherent problem and they would not replace it, only refund my money. At that point I tried the blender and the shakes/smoothies were great, but I sent it back since I didn't trust the integrity of the base. The strange thing is that Amazon is still selling this blender and if I really wanted to (NOT) I could order it again."
4,Braun MX2050 PowerMax,For the money this blender is very good. It also rates very high in Consumer reports.
3,So far its just okay......,"I bought this blender because of its great ratings on Consumer Reports, but I am not really impressed. I have had this blender now for about a month and its just okay. We make a lot of smoothies and it doesn't seem to chop up the ice enough for me. That's all we use it for, so I don't know what else it does or how well it does it. I am still hoping to find a blender that creates really smooth drinks. Good luck to you...."
4,"Good, Durable","My wife uses this blender for making smoothies, and it gets the job done. We've been using it for five years now, and it seems to be holding up pretty well. The jug disassembles easily for cleanup; everything (except the base) can go in the dishwasher."
2,Good....but it didn't last...,"Per the reviews, I purchased this and found it terrific. However, it died within 10 months, and because I don't have a certified repair shop in my state, I had to send it away at a cost of $10 + insurance. It has been 2 months and still it has not been returned due to a part that has not arrived. If I had to buy a blender again, I'd buy a cheaper one. It may not be as powerful, but at least you would have it! My last cheap one lasted 16 years!"
1,Defective and Impossible to Return,"As mentioned by other reviewers, the gear at the base of the blender (which drives the blade) is made of plastic, and the teeth break off easily. I owned this product for 6 months, only making my daily smoothie and my son's protien shake, and three of the six gear teeth broke off. The major problem is this, however -- the blender is virtually impossible to return unless you live close to one of the ""authorized"" repair shops that Braun has listed on their website. You can't return it to Amazon after 30 days, and Braun will only repair or replace defective items through their difficult-to-find repair sites. Don't waste your money on this one."
3,"Good, but....","Replaced another, almost new blender with this Braun because it is powerful and relatively quiet. But: (1) still waiting for a replacement for the blade, after several of the plastic teeth broke off in short order, and (2) liquid easily spurts through the openings in the cover. These are design flaws that Braun should have tested for, are correctable, and should be corrected under the warranty."
3,Rust on the blade,It is a good blender. But the center of blade has some rust after about one week use. Is it OK?
5,Braun MX2050 Blender,"This machine works great, it's quiet and blends icy drinks perfectly, just what I was looking for. Consumer Reports was correct."
5,Top Rated By Consumer Reports For A Reason!,We use it modtly to make smothies and protien drinks. Easely beats the Vita Mix we had. Easy to clean. Only minor complaint is that it sometimes leaks a little out the top.
3,This blender won't last long,"This blender was purchased to replace an old Braun blender that I loved, but the quality is not the same. The insert in the cover doesn't completely close, and the materials at the bottom of the jug are cheaply made, kind of like a toy blender. I'd recommend the Michael Graves hamilton beach blender from Target -- it's much better."
2,Powerful but didn't last,"I've had this blender for a little over 6 months, and I use it almost every day to make smoothies and puree food for my daughter. It does a great job overall in both of those departments. However, the gears on the bottom of the jar that attach to the base are plastic and a few of them have already broken off! I bought this blender for the price and because America's Test Kitchen recommended it. I'm happy with the performance, but I need something that's going to withstand being used on a daily basis."
4,Braun MX2050 PowerMax Jug Blender,The blender works well but placing the handle in the back so the controls are on the front and the handle in the back is very awkward.
5,Great Blender,"This is a very simple, no-frills blender. It has a dial on the front with 5 speeds. That's it. What it does offer is great power and a blender that does the job it's intended to do. I use it to make smoothies almost every morning, and they're always perfect. I bought this blender based on it's top rating in Consumer Reports and I have not been disappointed."
4,"Powerful, performs well",This blender does what a blender should in my mind. Frozen drinks are the perfect consistency without effort. One downfall I have discovered is that the lid needs to be removed entirely in order to pour.
5,Great Blender,"I bought this blender because a friend had highly recommended it. I use it for dips, soups, and to puree baby food. It works great and is easy to clean."
1,Gears Broken,"I have had this blender for over 6 months but it is no longer of use to us. The white plastic gears on the bottom are broken off. I do not think I can order that replacement part either.Consumer reports said it was the best performer, even addressing the plastic gear-tooth assembly but said the manufacturer says units made in the Czech Republic have been improved. Mine was made in the Czech Republic and the gears are all broken up.The toughest thing this blended was frozen blueberries.HORRIBLY disappointed after finding Consumer Reports recommending it."
5,Great blender,"I have been using for two weeks. I make at least two smoothies a day. My last ""smoothie machine"" blender would leave chunks of banana and ice. This thing blends everything. No chunks and with less effort. So far this has been a great blender. Will see how long it lasts, but for what I paid, and for how much it is used, if I get a year out of it, I will be pleased."
1,Far too weak,"I first used this blender in January 2006. We did not use it very heavily at all. I ordered new blades for it twice and now it won't blend anything. The new blades just about doubled the original price. I thought Braun had a good reputation, but I am throwing this blender away and I don't plan to purchase a Braun product again."
1,"Loved it, at first!",This blender was recommended and highly rated on CR. It was great at first but quiclkly lost it's steam. Maybe it wasn't meant for smoothies with ice? I have since replaced it.
1,It Broke Twice,"I experienced broken teeth on the bottom of the jar first, for which I got a free replacement. Today the plastic disk on the blender that the drive shaft spins broke as well, and it is obvious that this repair would require servicing. The blender worked great, but then it broke twice. The cheap plastic parts are definitely not up to the task of chopping frozen items for very long."
1,Died just after warranty expired,"This blender worked fine until I owned it for 14 months. Then it suddenly died. No warning at all. I did not use it all that much, either. I won't buy this brand again."
1,Bonehead design,"Add me to the list of purchasers who've had trouble with the plastic blade/gear assembly breaking - twice! Braun claims this is due to a manufacturing problem, but it seems more like an example of bonehead design, using a weak plastic part to transfer the power from the motor to the blade. I'll contact Braun and try to get a second replacement part, but I'm doubtful that it will last any longer than the first two, which was perhaps 10-20 smoothies each.Amazon needs to add a 0 stars category for items like this one."
1,Consumer Reports RETRACTS GOOD REVIEW,"Consumer Reports (March 2004) says that they have changed their method of evaluating blenders because of this one - - they discovered that their testing didn't go on long enough to find out that the blenders break quickly. The magazine says that Braun will provide a free replacement blade and gear assembly - -but when we called, it turned out that we had to pay shipping to send the faulty blender back to them. I had only used the blender about 30 times, and had never even put ice in it. I had only mixed yogurt with lecithin and other powders - - which has to be about as hard on a blender as mixing plain water. It had been extremely noisy from the first use, but all of a sudden it made a horrible noise and then it had only half its speeds. It would still run in speeds 1, 3, and 4, but did not run at all (not even a humming sound) in pulse, 2, and 5. This is a ridiculous failure after almost no use at all."
1,Died on 2nd use,On my 2nd batch of smoothies it started to smoke and smell really bad. Motor slowed to a crawl. Bought on CR reccomendation. Have to pay return shipping to Braun for repair. JUNK!
1,Will not buy again,I bought the blender based on CR....blender failed after ~8months of operation. The blade will not longer turn....can't seem to figure out what went wrong...but will not buy again!
1,Replacement gear looks the same.,"One tooth of the blade gear broke the first time I used the blender with some frozen fruit in it, all the other teeth broke off the second time. I called the 800 number for a new part, but it looks almost exactly like the other one, and the plastic teeth feel just as flimsy. I'm afraid to use the blender for anything that isn't soft.Only difference is the nut has markings and the blades are at a different angle. Plastic seems identical.Please post/review your experiences with the replacement blade.My girlfriend is thinking of making a metal cast of the plastic gear, assuming I don't actually use it and break it."
2,Not recommended,"It is a great engine and jar. Good blender. But it does not last. Braun has received so many complaints and they have not improved the situation with the cheap plastic base gearing that seems to become defective within a year of use. The many reviews online indicate the same: not recommended.I bought this blender last summer ('07) for about $60, and it has stopped working properly in Nov. '08.While it worked it was fantastic for smoothies, etc.It is a waste, though. Asking for a replacement from Braun costs time and money. Many people have received a replacement, which has broken time and again. Too bad! How can Braun make a great blender and blow it up with such a basic part (they should make this part metal, or of better quality.)"
4,Braun Blender,"I purchased the Braun Blender from the internet because it was the Best Buy pick from Consumer Reports. My old Oster blender finally gave out after about 40 years! I have not had it very long to give it a credible review; however, I am disappointed with the plastic piece on the bottom of the blender which is sure to wear out. I hope you will consider manufacturing a steel part and replacing them to all purchasers. After reading other reviews. I see other consumers have had problems with this same part. I am very happy with the way it works but am considering requesting this part BEFORE it breaks. What do you suggest?"
2,What a let down,"This blender is awful. We've had it a few months now, and while it appears to be well-constructed of heavy glass, basic no frills controls... the blade connection in the bottom of the container is plastic and it strips out of the motor constantly. We end up grinding the plastic more than combining what's in the blender."
1,Terrible; two of them both died in less than a month,"DO NOT buy this if you're thinking of blending anything frozen. My first one failed after nine smoothies. I figured it was just a fluke so I tried again -- same result with the second one. What a waste.Basically, if you push it too hard, there's some sort of clutch in there that burns out. It's like when the clutch on your car is slipping -- the motor spins, but if you put even the smallest amount of resistance on the blades it disengages."
3,Just OK...,"For the price, this blender works well. However, I found that blending drinks with ice or frozen fruit tended to be difficult at times. If the mixture got too thick, the blades would pull in air and stop mixing until you stopped and pushed the mixture down. Other than that, it worked much better than a few other blenders I have used.Also, after about a month of daily use a few of the plastic drive teeth broke (on the blade assembly). I then found out that a replacement blade assembly would cost nearly half the price of the blender!If you are not blending frozen fruit smoothies very often, you'll probably find this blender satisfactory. Otherwise (for a little more money), I would highly recommend the ""Oster Fusion"" blender instead (BRLY07B)! It's well worth the extra cost and works MUCH better!"
2,Another Consumer Reports Sucker,"Bought based on CR's report and it worked great for about a week. As several others have mentioned, the plastic white piece under the jug has started breaking and we probably have one or two uses left before it won't work any longer. Consumer Report's testing lab obviously didn't test it for very long. Don't buy this until they fix this problem."
1,very disappointing,"this blender is a huge disappointment as Braun are usually so reliable. I switched it on twice and both times there was a horrible burning smell, the machine wobbled on the kitchen counter, and this was at the lowest setting.... can't imagine what the top speed is like!"
2,Flawed drive system,This is a very hard blender to use - the drive system will not engage properly. We just bought it in July and my wife wants to put it in the garbage. We went back to using our 20 year old Waring blender.
2,Motor Burns Out,"OK - it ran for just over 1 year. It was only used for frozen beverages and not that frequently. It worked great at first, but the motor doesn't seem up to the task..."
2,After all these years - still a drive gear design problem!,"As one who works in manufacturing, I know the pressure to deliver a product to the consumer at a price he or she is willing to pay, BUT continuing to produce a product with a long-term design problem is inexcusable. Braun should recall all of the MX2050 blenders due to the design of their drive gear. The plastic gear breaks once too much torque is applied, and the teeth simply shear off.I have a suggestion for anyone looking for a general purpose blender. Go to eBay in the ""Collectibles"" area, and look for a good old Oster or Waring - one from the '60 or '70s. No, these older blenders may not have the latest CPU technology, or fancy modes, and they may be the wrong color, but they work! And, they will continue to work after the Braun has chewed up its next drive gear. You can buy a really nice used Osterizer or Waring for less than $25 on eBay, and either will outlast the MX2050."
1,Blender problem,"I purchased this blender because Consumer Reports rated it the best for making smoothies and ice drinks. Three weeks after I got it, some of the plastic teeth on the bottom of the blade mechanism broke off. It still worked, but I am sure the rest would break off soon. I returned the blender and will look for one with no plastic parts on the important operating mechanisms."
4,"Braun Blender, not bad for the price","The main reason we bought this blender was the great review in Consumer Reports. Overall, it's not bad. It does what it's supposed to do and the jar is lighter than the Kitchenaid blender it replaced, which we had for 7 years prior to this one. Our main gripe is the pouring spout on the jar. It's difficult to pour pancake mix from the jar without having the mix run down the side of the jar."
2,good but not for long,"we use our blender for frozen drinks at a minimum of once or twice a week. this blender works really good but with that amount of use it did not last long-only about 6 months. we now have a Oster Beehive Chrome Blender, which we have had for about 2 years now, and we love it! It works great, looks great and even feels like a sturdy well made item."
1,Base was cracked,Base does not appear to be very sturdy. Was cracked when opened the box even though it was well packed. Returing this item.
4,Great all purpose blender,"If you are looking for a good all around blender for a decent price, take a serious look at this blender. It has a lot of power and it was rated number one on consumer reports. I am plenty satisfied."
5,love my new blender,The blender arrived quickly after the order was put in. We have used it mainly to make smoothies. Works great and cleans up easily and nicely.
1,Zero stars if possible,"Warning, this is the worst blender I've ever used. It is heavy, hard to clean and the plastic blades break. I'm on my second one after the first broke in just a few weeks of use and it just broke. The whole plastic part on the bottom of the blade (under the blender) just broke off. Stay away from this blender. I bought this because ""Comsumers Reports"" said it was good. They were wrong! I would give this peace of junk zero stars if possible but that is not an option."
2,Cheaply made plastic gears at base of blade.,"I bought the blender on the Braun name and owned it a bit over a year, the first plastic gear broke off after two weeks, and then another broke off about six months later, today two more gears broke off and rendered the blender useless. Looked into a replacement part, costs about $17 which was half the price I've paid for the whole blender! I'm very disappointed Braun would use such a poorly designed gear which makes the whole unit poor and downgrades the brand. I now am looking at other brand blender to replace this one, not another Braun. I can't believe this gadget only lasted one year. Prior to my Braun I owned an indestructible $10 Sunbeam lasted forever and donated away because it was so 70's looking."
1,lasted less than a year,"I did my homework and bought this blender based on consumer reviews from Amazon. It lasted for for about a year....light usage, average once per week. The plastic teeth broke on the bottom of the glass jug (everyones complaint now). But the real disappointment??? I contacted Braun via e-mail to see if they could send me a replacement part (which I was willing to buy, but have since seen that they will send them for free), and they didn't even have to courtesy to respond. No customer service? Forget them."
2,"Jug Blender? More like ""ugh"" Blender!","I mean this is an okay blender but the blades frankly aren't top quality if you ask me. It has a user friendly design and everything, but it seems like Braun has turned a blind eye to the MX2000 line recently as they can be faulty and often have a crippled spin right out of the box (!) I recommend instead a Black and Decker or heck, even two forks."
4,"Great blender, but buy replacement blades","I bought this blender based on the recommendation of a cooking magazine. After three months of almost daily use to make smoothies and crushed ice drinks, the white plastic gear teeth on the bottom of the blade spindle started breaking off.The authorized repair shop said they would need to send the entire unit back to Braun. I opted instead to buy original replacement blade assemblies online for about $6 each. That was a month ago and the blender is operating like new.I'm disappointed that the blender broke so soon. But it blends and crushes ice so much better than the previous two blenders I've owned. So I'll keep buying the replacement blades until the motor gives out. Then I'll probably buy the same blender, hoping that Braun will have beefed up the plastic teeth by then."
4,Braun Blender,This blender came highly recommended by a leading consumer magazine. It has 5 speeds which are very satisfactory. I love that all of the pieces go in the dishwasher. It crushes ice in no time. Overall I like it much better than the last 2 blenders I have owned.
5,We love this blender!,"It's the only one that stands up to daily smoothie making! We use frozen bananas and frozen berries and work out blender HARD. We burned out a KitchenAid, a Krups, and an Osterizer before we got this one. I love it and I would not trade it for anything. The trick with frozen ingredients is to use the pulse feature and make sure you have the right proportions of frozen and non-frozen stuff together. In over a year I have had none of the issues that the other reviewers have mentioned and I give this blender my highest recommendation."
1,motor burnt out after short time,"I primarily used this blender to make smoothies. Well, I used it not more than 10 times and it started to smoke! I will take it to an authorized service center, but that's not supposed to happen with such a new item."
1,AVOID THIS PRODUCT!!,"I am embarassed to admit that I have owned two of these. The first one lasted a year. Then I discovered that top of the base unit had cracked. Since I had no other problems with it, and thinking this was a fluke, I purchased another one. Within one month, the top had cracked in the same place, and the rotary control knob fell off. This is a poorly constructed unit which will not hold up under normal use."
1,It's true the teeth on the bottom break,"I've had this blender for 5 months. At first, I loved it. It's extremely powerful and blends. But all the other reviews are true, the teeth on the bottom of the carafe just broke. Initially it was just one, but just now all of them broke off while trying to make a smoothie. I only used this blender once a week, so imagine if you used daily. What a piece of junk!"
1,Plastic parts,"I use a blender to make protein shakes. This includes ice cubes or frozen friut. In this blender the part where the blades connect to the motor is made of plastic. This part broke in about three months. I called Braun, they were very good about it and sent me a replacement part in a couple of days. Shortly after this something broke in the base and the motor no longer will turn the blades. I'm guessing there are more plastic parts in the base. This blender will probably work fine for mixing liquids, but if you plan on placing greater demands on it try another brand. I subjected an Oster blender to the same treatment for years before if gave out."
3,Braun MX2050 Powermax Jug blender,"I bought this blender because of the recommended , high rating given it by Consumer Reports. We use a blender almost daily for a family of seven, blending fruits and berries ( some of which are frozen). Our blender gets a good workout! We have been happy with the performance of the blender but were dissapointed by a design fault in the pitcher, which , surprisingly was not even mentioned by Consumer Reports. The pitcher has almost no lip and does not pour well at all. The juice we have blended runs down the outside of the blending jar, which is messy and inconvenient.It is hard to understand how a feature flaw such as this was ignored! We have to hold our glasses against the pitcher and run them up the jug upon filling to reduce the spilling/ drips that result. This definately is a complaint. I would be VERY Happy with this product if the company would issue a new jug after resolving the problem. I would then be able to rate it with FIVE stars!!"
1,Stinker!,"Well, folks, they haven't fixed the design flaw in this product, so don't buy it. I went on the referral of Consumer Reports, hoping that Braun had made the teeth on the bottom on the blender stronger. But the reviewers before me were right!Makes me all the more sad that my husband broke the 1960s vintage blender I had for 15 years. Not only did it look cool, it performed like a trooper until he put the glass pitcher in cold water after blending hot soup -- ouch!"
1,Had high expectations,"After reading the reviews I was convinced this blender was the best for the money. I mostly make smoothies and similar textured things and this blender can't keep a blendable mass moving. It is also terribly noisy and shaky on the low setting and the icons on the control panel are hard to decipher. It gets one star because the glass and blades are sturdy (not much help if the machine can't do the job.) I considered returning it, but decided to avoid the hassle and use it until it burns out, and then replace it with something else (don't expect this to take too long.)"
5,Best Blender on the Market,"This is clearly the best all-purpose blender on the market. It does EVERYTHING well, unlike the others. Only problem is that it's hard to find in stores; hence, the purchase from Amazon. You won't find another blender that's as good as this one!"
4,Limited Use,"Worked well crushing ice, but I've only used it twice. The pitcher is heavy glass - definetly wouldn't want to drop it. I would prefer a nicer control interface over the dial option - but the blender seems to do it's job fine."
5,Best blender I have ever had,"Although not fancy, this is the best blender especially for the money. I tried it since it was highly rated in Consumer Reports. I like it so much that I bought another one as a gift. Forget those fancy blenders and get this one that just really works."
2,A throw away appliance,"Purchased this item March 2007, totally broken down and out of warranty July 2010. This is not your mothers Waring blender that it will last a lifetime. This is a cheap plastic item that you will throw into the landfill after couple of years. It is a good example of Braun quality."
5,Finally - a great affordable blender`,"Excellent blender - easy to use, easy to clean. The best part is that if you like frozen drinks, it blends the ice to a fine, uniform texture that is absolutely PERFECT!"
2,BRAUN isn't as BRAWNY as it once was!,"After arrival everything WORKED PERFECTLY, just as CR reported. I just wonder how they do a rigorous test on appliances such as this. I think they tested this brand new. Anyway, this is made unusually cheap for a Braun product. After some months, the Braun PowerMax became the Braun PowerFlop! Others expressed similar results gears broken etc... Now I'm looking into The Oster Beehive line close in price."
1,Defective,"First time we tried it only 2 of the 5 speeds functioned. It's on the way back to Amazon. An e-mail to Braun remains unanswered. Braun did respond to my e-mail, offering to send me a free blade assembly so those with blade assembly problems take note."
2,Broken Teeth,"Apparently I concur with almost everybody else! We did lots of research to find a blender to make smoothies and frozen drinks. We were careful to use small chunks of ice and followed the directions that came with the blender, but after a few uses the plastic teeth at the base of the pitcher broke off. The teeth probably should be made of metal. Otherwise, it's a great blender and works as advertised. Strange to find this type of problem in a Braun."
2,Consumer Reports UPDATED review,"What the reviewer who mentions Consumer Reports fails to say is that CR updated their review a few months later, saying that this Braun blender failed several durability tests. That's why it's being offered at such a deep discount, of course! If you only use this to blend smoothies or something, you could be fine, but heavy duty work will make the plastic innards break and shatter. Buyer beware."
3,Good...until it breaks,"Got my blender from Amazon (it was a good price by the way) and really liked the appearance, performance and everything about it until it broke. The plastic toothed gear that drives the blades breaks easily with no abuse. Going to see what the warranty does for me but even with immediate replacement (which I doubt) the blender that we should be able to use is out of commission."
1,No more smoothies,I was so excited to get my new blender for my birthday. It wasn't two weeks later that it was broken. The plastic piece on the bottom broke off which meant that the motor could no longer spin the blade. The ice crushing feature was a joke. Pieces of frozen fruit would jam the blade causing the bottom piece to spin and ultimately break off. I expected better quality from Braun. They usually have such good items. Make sure when buying a blender that the bottom of the blade is made of a very sturdy plastic or metal. And Braun's warranty: You'd better make sure you live near one of their factories. It could take quite some time to get a replacement.
1,"Great blending, awful design","Like many others here, I have had numerous problems with the plastic gears breaking off. We've been through two replacements (luckily in stock at local repair center), but now it's time for a new blender because it makes no sense to keep doing this. I'm disappointed because, as a blender, it worked great."
1,Defect in the blade mechanism,"This blender definitely has a problem with the blade. The plastic pieces that connect to the base that spin the blade are extremely vulnerable to breaking. I broke ALL of them within the first 6 months of owning the blender. For the record if you break one and try to run the blender, it will break all the other pieces.While I have not contacted Braun yet, I will do so to try and get a replacement part. This is definitely a defect in this product and I do not recommend purchasing a ... blender to use for a few months."
2,What A Piece of Junk!,"I am so glad to see that I'm not alone in my extreme disappointment with this product!I bought this blender less than two years ago. Within weeks, the cheap plastic gears on the blade assembly started to come off. Braun sent me a replacement. A few months later, same problem. Now, even with yet another replacement, the blades won't even spin.Braun's response? They sent me a coupon for $2.00 off a bag of DOG FOOD! When I contacted them again, they said they'd pay for 1/2 the repair cost. Never mind that the nearest service center is 50 miles away ... this, for an item that cost me $50.Like everyone else, I reasearched thoroughly and took Consumer Reports' recommendation. This is the first time I've regretted it! I will NEVER buy Braun products again!"
2,Braun the best?,"I bought this blender after checking the Consumer Reports ratings. It is dissapointing because it has a flimsy plastic base, is top-heavy because of this and it's height. The blender is very loud but does perform well including pulverizing ice. We bought another brand."
3,Disappointed,"I bought the Braun MX 2050 to replace a 40 yr old Sears blender that was still operating. While the Braun is certainly more powerful, it produces disappointing results when blending fruit into shakes. The Sears produced a smooth mixture; the Braun leaves small chunks of fruit in the mixture. I've tried a variety of settings without success. I believe the smooth edged blades in the Sears vs the Braun account for the difference."
5,Best. Book. Ever.,"I always loved the movie, which I admit I saw before reading the book. The book, however, blew me away. This the ultimate best book I've ever read. Truly a classic, this story should be read by everyone. Peter is a fantastic hero, Hook a sinister villian, and the Lost Boys an adorable bunch! J.M. Barrie uses a whimsical style that's intruiging and enjoyable. Peter Pan will never grow old, and neither will his tale!"
3,Interesting,"Fun. I guess More was ahead of his time by a couple of centuries. An early version of utopian socialism. Perhaps Utopia was better than living in London or any city back in the day, but after finishing the book, I thought that I would not want to live in Utopia. Drab clothing, mandated lifestyle. In a perverted sense, it's Tocqueville's tyranny of the majority. All I kept thinking was Amish, minus the barns."
1,awaiting,I am presently on the Isle of Palms in South Carolina and my kindle is not receiving the internet therefore as of nowI still have not received the Utopiaam trying to remedy this problem but so far am unsuccessful will keep tryingthank youFrancis Boudreau
3,Idealism runs rampant,"I've been meaning to read this one for a while. I didn't dislike it per say but I did find myself rolling my eyes at the rosy glass idealism once in a while. Yes, the society of Utopia is a really good idea, on paper. The idea of people truly living in this perfect communist-ish world, however I find a bit far fetched. Particularly the idea that a nation that deals with other nations on a regular basis somehow survives without acknowledging the (admittedly fictitious) value of gold. Yes, I suppose it would be nice if the wife and kids always listened to daddy who knows best but really, what are the odds of that? So I did like this book, in the historical perfect world fantasy sort of sense, but cold hard reality washed the magic away for me."
4,Utopia,"I mostly loved this book, it was alittle confusing however. This is definely a book that im going to have to reread to get more out of it."
3,Unsure of More's Love or Disdain for Collectivism,"Have known about this book for many years, and just finished the Kindle version.I'm left unsure of More's love or disdain for ""Utopia"" ... perhaps that's what he intended, though.It rather clearly paints a picture of collectivism in an agrarian society; 'one for all and all for all'.He accounts with great detail the Utopian society and how the collectivist state of mind colors every aspect of their society. Other than a few inserted comments like 'while we might feel this custom or that custom an affront or absurd to our way of thinking', he adds very little dis-accreditation of their Utopian/idealistic beliefsWhere I found myself wanted just a bit more, was in the conclusion of the book ... which is just a few, short paragraphs ... where there's little refutation of the Utopian Ideal."
5,Love It!,Good book. I am a history major and I love being able to view items like Utopia on my Kindle.
2,Kindle Version is NOT the book!,Kindle users beware!!! I purchased this for my Kindle and was sadly disappointed to discover that this was in fact not the book Utopia just a synopsis and review of the society Utopia.
3,Great book,Great read! Had to read for a clash and I thought it was a very easy read. Definitely recommend it.
2,Unfortunately too 16th century in its thinking,"I bought this book because it is a revered ""classic"". While I am sure More's intent might have been good, and his ideas even acceptable during his time, the main problem with his theory is the lack of freedom allotted to the individuals in his utopia. This sort of thing just does not fly these days."
3,Free!,It's a classic and it was free which probably is why I'm not super upset that I didn't finish it. :)
3,Interesting Read,"I had a really hard time reading this book. Not because it was bad, just because the old English was hard for me to concentrate on and follow at times. I often found myself reading the words but not actually reading the story and having to go back and reread sections. It definitely got better in Book Two, I finished that portion in a fraction of the time. I would suggest reading it while you aren't going to be distracted if you aren't used to that type of language.As for the story itself, it's interesting to see what was viewed as what could be an ideal society. Obviously without taking human nature in to account though. These ideas may have been good for the political world, but it definitely sounded boring and mundane for the regular people!"
2,Not that Impressed,"Don't get me wrong, I did like the interval walk, but I found it difficult to follow along with it, because she dosen't give you a count or a beat as to when you need to do another move. The energy is kind of low. Also, you can't forward through the advertisments at the beginning of the DVD."
2,Annoying and useless,"I've been using Jillian Michaels' workout videos for a couple months now, and I was looking for another strength training video to add some variety. 2-Week Turnaround's instructor is incredibly annoying. People may find it annoying that Jillian stops doing the exercises to explain proper form, but that is much better than how this lady doesn't bother to explain form, and huffs and puffs while trying to say what to do. I am a very tolerant person, but she is totally fake and obnoxious.I didn't even break a sweat, so not only is this video annoying, it is also useless. Leaving two stars since it might be good for newbies, but overall, it is just awful. Stick with Jillian, ladies."
1,Not good skates!,"We bought these for our 4 yr old and were disappointed with them. Too big and hard to handle, however, we picked up a pair of the basic plastic pair that her shoe can also fit in and she did great! After they get the hang of those, the Barbie adjustable inline skates are great! They are $ and well worth it! Stay away from the ""learn to inline skates"" though! Luckily the store took those back!"
1,Very disappointed,We bought these skates for our 5 year old. She could barely skate in them. They are too big and bulky for children just learning to skate. We returned them and have yet to find another pair.
5,Girl's skates,Very satisfied with this item. My daughter has learned how to skate in these. They grow with her too. She's (8) and still uses them. Very durable.
1,Barbie learn 2 inline skates,These skates were given to my daughter as a birthday gift. I really do not like them the straps keep coming un straped and she is bound to twist her ankle if not fall and break a bone. They are now in the closet and I hope she forgets about them.The are not safe at all.
3,Love the costume. Service needs improvement,Costume came in the right and new condition. I wanted to cancel the order after what I read in the prior buyers; that items even paid with expedite service wouldnt arrive on time and item would arrive damaged and there's a lack of communication from the seller's part. Since they didnt answer my email I gave in and waited to see if the item would come before Oct. 31st. My order came 2 days before the event begins. At least the item was delivered on time. Service needs improvement!
4,"Old, but good, a view of the world of spies after 1917.","This takes a while to figure out, but is worth the effort. It begins in the period right after the Russian revolution, and follows the careers of two double agents. Enough mayhem farther in, but a good yarn."
2,Not enough pictures,I am going from color to gray and this book did not show many pictures at all. It is mostly for women who are just going gray now and are choosing to keep it with enhancements.
2,Too general,"I was disappointed by this book. I just found it too overwhelming and too general to figure out what should work for me. I stopped dyeing my hair 2 years ago and was hoping for some help on what colors to choose for clothing, makeup, and hair care. But this book was too hard to figure out what I should do. There are a number of lists of hair and makeup products - but which ones do I choose? There were a few pages dedicated to good makeup color palettes according to eye color and skin tone - but mine wasn't represented! (Brown eyes; pale rosy skin tone). I actually ended up feeling more confused after reading this book."
5,GOING GRAY AND LOVING IT!,"Thank you, thank you, thank you Diana! I have looked and looked for information on how to celebrate my gray (silver and white) hair and your book has finally put it all in one place. Can't thank you enough for the excellent, inspiring information. Pamela D. Blair, Author The Next Fifty Years: A Guide for Women at Mid-Life And Beyond"
3,Too high maintenance.,"I want to be more natural and simplify my hair and cosmetic routine. Going gray would be a part of that. I bought this book for encouragement and to teach me how to do it. However, the author convinced me that it would be more work than I'm already doing. Even gray hair needs to be dyed or highlighted, it sounds like, to get a pretty gray. Cosmetics and clothes colors need to change. Botox and other cosmetic surgery considered? This book isn't what I was looking for."
2,Good intentions,I've read this book and also Going Gray by Ann Kreamer. I might add that I have gone totally gray and I'm loving it. I think the author's intentions are good but I preferred Kreamer's book over this one. I read both b/c I wanted some inspiration before I took the plunge. I think the Going Gray Looking Great website is more helpful than the book itself.
5,protection,"this lock is much larger then i first thought, it fits great thru the wheel of my scooter, easy to put on and take off"
4,Solid,Arrived on time and comes with 4 keys. Hooks easy on either tire and is very solid. I believe its a good buy for the money and I would trust leaving my bike somewhere while traveling.
4,Alaska topo,"Other than the fact that the scale is way to small at 1:250,000 this is a valuable resource that is very useful. I carry one of these for every location that I go.Go idea to tape the pages because the stable binding falls apart with use"
3,"If you want topographical information it is great, but",it is difficult to use and really too large to handle on a trip.
3,Informative,Good tips you may not find anywhere else. Gives their reasons for the RV they took and the route they selected. I could have done with fewer comments about the all you can eat places.
3,Reformat it please,"As an independant traveler I have a Gazetteer for every state. They are worth their weight in gold. However, this one was very disappointing. Due to the formatting the major roadways and the majority of the Kenai are in the folds, bindings, or on the grid margins. This would be great if you were going to be in the remote areas, but it was worthless to use for trekking from a main highway onto side roads where most travel. Sorry DeLorme, you need to reformat the layout."
3,The Motorcyclist's Map?,"This atlas is well put together and fairly detailed. When I ordered this, I was thinking that this would show all those minor local dirt roads that do not appear on regular maps. However, there are simply not very many roads in Alaska. If you're planning a road trip, even the less detailed maps will show most of the roads. So, if you're planning a road trip into Alaska, this map's scale is too big to be used for high-level planning, and perhaps not detailed enough to backpackers or other users. The book is really too large to store on a motorcycle. So for road users, stick with a folding map and save your money for The Milepost publication.The Milepost 2012The 2012 version comes out in March, 2012."
5,Gift,This book was a gift. I have no personal knowledge of the book and its worth. My family member said he really enjoyed the book.
4,Something About Mary,"Among the ironies of the ordination of women in mainline denominations is a renewed Protestant interest in the Catholic icon of femininity, the Blessed Virgin Mary.These essays by contemporary, mostly women theologians examine the sparse but highly suggestive biblical references to Mary, and then interpret her importance in light of Reformed theology and their own experience. Almost to a person, the authors balk at the Catholic dogmas of the Immaculate Conception and the Assumption, but they also criticize the unofficial Protestant dogma of virtual silence about Mary.The result is a diverse yet coherent reappraisal that views Mary as the archetype of Christian discipleship. This not un-Catholic consensus may serve as the basis for further rapprochement between Protestants and Catholics regarding the humble but sometimes controversial mother of Jesus."
3,Quite amusing BUT....,"From reading the blurb on the back I was expecting at least half of the book to be about Megs's (the main character) success. I got sick of her whining on about being ordinary but doing absolutely nothing about it!!It was only in the last 2 chapters that she and her mate, Lorraine, finally got to open their long-dreamed of sandwich bar.It was as if the author suddenly realised that the book had grown to almost full capacity and main protagonist still hadn't done anything so she decided to cram it in quickly!!!! I also got tired of the constant descriptions of the mess and chaos in Megs's house. I think it was supposed to endear the reader to her but in my case it didn't work and I kept wishing she'd get off her backside and DO something.I think the humour in the book saved the day."
5,Great story tellers,Bill Neely and Bob Ottum are great story tellers and have managed to weave a very entertaining reading. The used book arrived in fine condition and even had a personal note inside from one of the authors.
1,Quest for Holy Grail of Starling-proof Feeder Now Continues...,"Unfortunately, the starlings enjoyed the suet from this feeder immensely. It porvided no help at all in keeping them out."
5,Squirrel Proof indeed!,What a kick I get out of watching the pesky squirrels try to get to my suet now!I may have to get another one....or two....
5,Akmacdon is a dope,No wonder he/she has gone through two of these: they're hooking a powered subwoofer to a power amp. Obviously they don't understand signal flow or at the very least how to hook up a stereo.
1,Trouble ... at first ... then Redemption!,Sounded great for a short while. Fuses keep blowing so something is very wrong. Hoping Amazon takes care of this one ... we'll see. Depressing to have something that should work yet won't ... I never cranked it up or drove it hard.Stay away from Audiosource.UPDATE: they sent a new amp section --- easy to install and has been superb since then. Now 4 and 1/2 stars. It's been fine for two years plus now! Excellent customer service too!
1,lets hope for the best,"I was extremely excited to recieve my sub. I could'nt believe what I was getting for what I was paying. Much to my delight my subwoofer came 2 days after I had ordered it (not bad for free shipping) Any ways I was in ectasy while attaching the sub to my Pioneer Elite's sub-woofer pre-out makeing sure all of my monster sub cables were in their rightful plugs. Upon connection of the sub's power cord i flicked the subs power switch. First the on positions LED glowed red instead of green and then the amp startd to heat up consideraly this all climaxed with a violent BOOOOOOMMM from the massive 15"" inch driver which violently blew the rooms dedicated breaker. I was lefty in the dark clueless, What happened to my beutiful sub. It is in route to amazon as I type this. Hopefully the replacement will be much better than the runt sub i first recieved"
5,best boom for the buck!,"I think this sub has more than enough power. It rattles the china in the cabinet. I like the demo/test CD that came with the sub too. After shopping around and listening to many competitors models, this is putting out better sound than many ... models. My advise, if you want to spend ...0 on a sub, do not go for the 8"" or 10"" models. . . go for this 15"" one!"
4,Great Idea,"My son loves the tags on his toys, and this was a great idea for him, because now he has a lot of tags to choose from!"
3,"Cute, but not worth the money","The elephant truly is as cute as the picture. However, for the money, it's just not worth it. I bought this for my 6-month old for Christmas. She doesn't play with it at all. The rattle on the inside of the elephant is too hard for her to grab and pull out. I'm hoping as she gets older and more coordinated that maybe it will engage her more."
5,Not your every day rattle,This is a very cute and interesting toy. It is light enough for a infant to hold it over his/her head and the various tags make it a great tactile experience. This toy offers many many many places for little fingers to grab onto and it makes a melodic jingle when shaken like a rattle.
5,Really neat elephant,"I purchased this for my granddaughter who is 6 mos old. She really likes this; lots of places to hold on to and chew on. She is particularly interested in the 3 little knotted ""hairs"" on top of the head--go figure! She hasn't discovered how to pull out the little mouse yet, but she is still a bit young for that. All in all, I am very happy with this toy."
2,baby not interested at all!,"My baby is 9mos old when i got this toy and she does not like it at all!, maybe it's her age. I just wasted my money for nothing. It's a good toy though but for younger age babies."
4,great for car rides!,"My 9 month old son loves it for the car rides because of the tags and the chime sound it makes when you shake it. Definitely worth the price, especially as it helps soothes the little one to sleep for car rides. Another good Taggie product."
5,Taggie elephant,If your child likes tags this is the way to go. My daughter loves to play with tags so we decided to get her a taggie. This one was a great choice. It has TONS of tags to touch and feel plus a little pull out toy in the middle.
5,Taggies Grabby Elephant Toy,"Taggies Grabby Elephant Toy is a hit with the grandkids. The silky tabs are great, they love picking it up with the tabs."
4,Cute and good for teething,My son uses tags on this animal for teething. It is really cute and has a mouse that you can pull and will go back to the inside of the elephant's tummy. Very light and portable for toddlers to carry around. It can be pricey depending on which site you go but I loved it and my son seems to enjoy playing with it.
3,I thought my son would like this more than he seems to.,"Purchased this for my 9 month old son along with a big taggies blanket. Since he loved checking out tags on other blakets and items in our home I figured he would just love it, but he actually doesn't seem that interested and it does not hold his attention for very long. It is really cute and I was happy with it when I received it. Maybe he will have to grow into it. He is not really at a point where he carries around stuffed animals yet."
1,The world is not that simple!,"The subject of apologies is much more complex than Ken and Margret would lead you to believe. The subject is a serious issue that needs to be handle in that fashion. It cannot be handled as a fairytale/bedtime story.At this rate in a couple of years Ken will be coming out with books like ""The One Minute President"", ""The One Minute Hostage Negotiation"", ""The One Minute Brain Surgeon"",..."
1,Save your money,"I was mildly enlightened, and amused, by Ken's original One Minute Manager book; to bad his latest attempt at ""making a buck"" just insults me."
1,"""A Zero Stars rating""","When I purchased the book I was expecting to learn something of value, and while I agree with the book's premise that apologies can be highly effective, it totally failed on providing me any significant insights as to how to best execute an apology. The book is way to superficial! It just states the obvious.How do I go about getting an apology from the authors of the book?Also, it appears that Ken is running out of ""material"" for his next ""great"" book when he stoops to co-authoring with his literary agent."
1,Don't waste your money.,Every mature adult knows how to apologize and knows the positive impact that it can have. They do not need Ken and Margret's simple little trite book. Save your money.
4,"small book, big message","At first I wondered if there couls be any substance in such a small book. But when I read it, I realized you don't have to go on for 400 pages to get the point across. Although I'm not sure that every bad relationship could be fixed by an apology, taking the steps suggested in the book sure can't hurt. Plus, knowing you might have to apologize later makes you think about what you're doing NOW."
3,These are OK for compact speakers,"I purchased these from Costco for way less than anywhere online. I have the predecessor to these as well, which I like better. The 500's are compact and lightweight, but the center channel makes voices sound somewhat hollow. The subwoofer is decent, and in 6 channel stereo mode on my Yamaha, the sound is very good. In normal pro-logic mode, the sound is lacking compared to my full size Infinity speakers, but I did expect that going in. I was looking to replace my failing speakers and save some space. I ended up using my old 15"" subwoofer for very low frequencies and the packaged Infinity woofer doing the mid bass. This way, they have more punch and it helps fill in for the small satellites. Overall, these are good, especially if you pick them up for $250 as I did."
5,"Naturewood Dinner Plates, Set of 2",Arrived in PERFECT condition. Well packed. Loved the color and design! Very happy with my purchase.
4,A few repetitions from his first album...,"If you've got the first, you'll have some of it repeated here. Nice work, but again repetitive. You'll have to be the judge."
4,good,this product. i would recommend to others.it smells amazing and it lasts pretty long.the spray attached on the bottle for mist sprays right amount when it comes to praying on face
3,Using to clear small red vessels from eyes,"I haven't see my eyes clear up like I'd like to, but I'm not giving up. Will continue using until I finish the bottle. If no results then I'll discontinue usage."
2,Suppossed to make eyes better but,Discovered that I had growths on my eyes caused from too much sun/wind exposure. The rose water did nothing to help with the problem. Eye doctor finally had to do a procedure to remove the growth. Rose water did not help.So i gave it the 3 stars as I may have expected more than I should have from the product. But the product did nothing for me.
4,not bad,left my skin a little parched but overall good product. I would order again. Many others sell this but this is truly organic.
5,"Wonderfully pure, clean and natural","We bought this as a homeopathic relief for my wife's allergy eyes. They would get very red and itchy, and the chemical 'medicine' the doctors had prescribed were worthless. Upon trying this it provided immediate relief. The redness and itching went away almost completely. We did have to buy an eye dropper seperately. We're highly satisffied, as this is pure distilled from actual rose petals, not an oil or artificial substance."
5,My favorite rose water,"This is by far the best smelling, longest lasting scented rose water I have ever used. Plus it doesn't contain anything other than rosewater which is a huge plus for me. A lot of rose waters claim to be rose water, but are typically just water with rose scent, or chemical scenting agents - this one actually delivers."
1,OUCH!,"This products does smell like fresh roses. However, using as directed, my face and neck broke out in a rash. This products was not soothing as described, and I do not have sensitive or fair skin. Def will not be purchasing again."
5,Easy to control,The LR Nelson Gear Drive Sprinkler is well made and very easy to control the sprinkling flow and direction. Works great.
4,Thorough,"An excellent overview of the energy picture with a thorough discussion of why predictions tend to fail. Before anyone gets too carried away with doomsday scenarios of impending energy crisis they should read this. Conversely, anyone not concerned about the state of our planet and our rate of energy consumption should also read this. Unfortunately, although the messages of the book are very appropriate for the common person, Smil's writing style may not be. His prose exudes a well educated elitism that at times can be stuffy and difficult to follow. (Or maybe I am just jealous because his command of the language is far superior to my own.)"
5,Classic,"Smil makes a powerful case for planning without forecasting. Uncertainty does not imply inaction, and the most important plans we make are sometimes the ones that do not get implemented."
3,Hard But Useful Read,"Read this for a Global Energy course, and I might I write that this is one book that I would not recommend to any one that is not working or investing in the industry. This read was very 'heavy' for the passive reader, and covered a large amount of numbers and forecasts that the author himself disputes."
1,Got it Wrong! Right on the Cover,"Started to buy this for myself as a prize for baby sitting a sick girlfriend. Till I saw the teaser on the back. Bonus Footage Shot By Hitler`s Mistress. Excuse me?!? Mistress?!? You guys make a documentary and don`t acknowledge the marriage in the bunker? What about Walter Wagner, the magistrate who performed the wedding, cut down by a shell splinter returning to his position. Either a deliberate slight toward Mrs. Adolph Hitler or sloppy research coming from an expert. Left me with that feeling of walking into Home Depot knowing more than them... Not a good feeling. Sorry fellas, but no sale. Say what you will about Eva Hitler,nee Braun, she was flying in when the whole flock of ""Golden Pheasants"" was pulling out. She deserves better, so does history and the art of the documentary."
3,"no longer stable, as the base has warped","I'm sure I could just put some felt on the bottom to even it out again, but I'm not disappointed. I really loved it when it came; it was the perfect size and look for a small table for painting. I noticed just a couple days ago that it no longer sits flat.. but I will still use it, I'm sure - just have to fix the wobbling."
4,Table Easel,I bought this as a gift for an elderly woman. I guess the recipiant likes it. She hasn't complained to me.
4,A must read for the action readers!,This is yet another installment of the series in which every book stands by itself. Pick one up and have fun!
3,not in the greatest shape,"The book took a little longer to arrive than expected and wasn't in ""good"" condition"
4,Good second 'castle' book,This is a good sequel book of Castle in the Attic. In this book William returns to the castle and the land round about it with his best friend. He learns you don't have to do what is 'cool and popular' to truly be brave.
4,The best book,"I read this book with my class back in fifth grade and I could not put it down.It is much more complex then ""The Castle in the Attic"". And a great read for younger readers."
1,Curious mother checks out this Yearling title paperback.....,"Sorely disappointed that this book is considered age-appropriate for ages 9 to 12. I can appreciate the fantasy genre. However, half-human walking rodents marching in mass, eating everything in sight, including flesh from humans until the point of death seems past the point of fantasy genre for the intended audience age. I also thought the medieval terminology necessary for the plot and setting of the story will require the age group of 9 to 12 to have a very extensive vocabulary to totally understand the book. I cannot imagine a teacher of this age group requiring this particular book as a possible read. There are too many other quality reading available."
3,Not a wow item,I tend to agree with those that have qualified this battery as a little deceptive. When we buy it we do expect to have much more power than we get with the regular battery but this is not true. Definitely the laptop manufactures only provide long lasting batteries when the laptop is a expensive one. What a shame!Alfredo Augusto CruzRio de Janeiro Brasil
4,2 hours 15~30min duration,"Bought a cheap generic brand PA3535U 12 cell on eBay for $45.99, ended up have to return it since it do not fit my A305-S6845.Would recommend anyone who looking for a replacement to get the original battery to save all the hassle.Duration for the first usage of my new battery under normal usage was 2 hours and 15~30min, duration is expectedas I do not have high expectation with Toshiba laptop battery length even though Toshiba laptop itself is very reliable and can last for several years.Wondering how long the battery could sustain that duration?"
3,Could last longer...,"This battery fits my Toshiba A200 very well. Although it is extended life, I hoped the battery would last longer (only ~2 hours in light usage)."
3,Toshiba battery PA3535U,"I expected more operation time for my laptop with this battery, the maximun operation time that I can get is 2 hours, using wifi, at least is one hour more than the original battery"
4,Good,"This is a good replacement battery, it works as advertised. I really like the ridge which slightly elevates the rear of the laptop. The battery has good run time."
4,Toshiba battery,"actually i bought it 2 weeks ago it's working fine till now giving me about 3.5 hours working with WIFI on , so it's a good option for who travels a lot ."
4,Good battery !,"I purchased this battery for less price than on www.toshibadirect.com, I'm pretty happy with this battery. It lasts about 3 hours on balance performance when the original battery only lasts 1 hour and a half. Anh also the battery can hold your laptop up a little bit makes it easier to type and the laptop won't get too hot when you put it on your bed because it gives space for the fan to get the air in. Anyway, this is a good battery."
1,Amazon battery for Toshiba,This is the third replacement battery over several years. This one does not hold charge as long as it should.
4,Replacement,We have two laptops which the batteries were beginning to not hold a charge. We purchased the larger battery for both laptops and have not had any issues since.
5,Perfect fit!,"Solved my power issues! Was having trouble charging my laptop. It would always say ""zero percent not charging"". When I pulled the plug it would shut down immediately. It was definitely an old bad battery and the new one fixed her right up."
1,Bad item!!!,"I bought 10 days agoand just this morning I presented my computer was shut down from time to time and now only turns on with the charger plugged in,I know how to proceed for the return of money or change of this battery ..."
3,Magazine is fair but service reliability is terrible,"I purchased this magazine to try to get back into French after a long hiatus. The magazine is ok but not as good as the Spanish magazine of the same type ""Piensa En Espanol"". The type is not as readable and the helps are not as convenient. The biggest problem is that I can't get the CD. I get the magazine on schedule but the CD doesn't come with it. I have called to complain that I don't get the CD - so they send me an audio tape. I call back to say that I don't want an audio tape, and eventually get a CD. It requires too much work to get the product I have purchased. I canceled after problems with the 3rd of 6 issues. If you are interested in this product, I recommend only getting the magazine, not the magazine with CD."
4,"Time to be afraid, Caleb","Caleb, a young New York City singer-songwriter, is going to have to deal with his fear when this disc gets heard. It crackles with thoughtful pop. Caleb brings a fresh hiphop feel to influences as varied as Police-era Sting(Pick Yourself Up), and Seal (These Four Walls) without being overwhelmed by them. And while the music can be quite lyrical, the lyrics speak to a dark wit (particularly, Welcome the opening track about the underbelly of celebrity). The production was handled by studio veteran, Kevin Killen(Peter Gabriel, Elvis Costello, and too many others to list) and Caleb. The musicianship on the disc is very good but Tony Levin's big-bottomed bass on I Fall to Pieces deserves special mention."
3,Unusually cool,"Even though I love the first song - Welcome - and I enjoyed several of the other songs because of their very different and mellow feel, I wouldn't recommend this CD. I love all types, all genres of music but this CD was well.....very forgettable."
2,I thought there was more to it,"at first I didn't even notice that it was only the first five episodes, so I was rather dissapionted with it, so I am hope to get the full season next time, to be able to enjoy all of it"
5,Brief Counseling in Action,Littrell's book on Brief Counseling is in my opinion one of the best guides for using the brief counseling technique in a school or mental health setting. He gives precise case examples that are easily read and can be applied. I have taught workshops on BT and recommend this as a must have book to my students.
4,Paradigm shifting approach to counseling,"Where there is not an extended length of time to promote change in a person's life, the technique of brief counseling is invaluable. Although not written from a Biblical counseling perspective, it can readily be applied in a Christian setting.Brief counseling is extremely useful for inner city ministry, where the opportunity to give long-term counseling is restricted and the necessity for quick change is present. Through a cooperative approach between the counselor and client, brief counseling limits dependency and empowers the client to replace faulty coping skills with healthy decision making. For results oriented counselors (like myself), it is a must read."
5,memories,this CD always brings back memories of my childhood. Every Christmas we would listen to these songs of Nat's. A must for anyone who enjoys traditional Christmas Music. Add it to your collection!
4,GOOD,"GOOD PRODUCT! I WOULD RECOMMEND IT. I REQUESTED A VINYL COPY, BUT I GUESS THE CD WILL DO. I'D RECOMMEND IT."
3,"Crisp and clean, and no caffine...","With an album cover this cool I thought it might be possible to get another album like 'Zehn'. Even if I didn't get my BB gun for Christmas, this album really isn't that bad. In fact I feel generic in saying this, but other reviewers are right it saying 'I'm not dreaming of you' and 'Aimee' are the best tracks on 6Feet Underground. My inner goth child will probably lay awake craving for another band like MESH to put something out that bites deeper breaking the skin. Sprite, 7 Up, Seirra Mist, it's all in the same family. This album will just be a visiting relative in my music consciousness."
3,"DeVision is awesome, this album isn't","I am a huge DeVision fan but like other reviews have posted, this album is good but not great. I'd even go as far to say that this is a low point of their career. In all honestly this album probably deserves 4 stars but compared to previous work, and as a DeVision fan, I can't give it more than 3 stars.No song particularly stands out or is very catching (ok there is 1 or 2 good songs). Either these songs never made the cutting board from a previous release or DeVision simply was not as inspired while they made this.Don't get me wrong, if this was their first album it would have been well liked but some of DeVision's previously releases have been the height of synhpop this album is just average.Die hard DeVision fans should still check it out but if you're new to DeVision this is a BAD place to start out. Passing fans of DeVision should just skip this album entirely."
3,Unremarkable,"Ethan Straffin is entirely right (see below). This is by quite a distance the most mediocre De/Vision album ever.In fact, this makes Devolution seem ground breaking.I could write quite a deal about this record. However, in lieu of this, I refer you to:i) Mr. Straffin's admirable comments; and,ii) My review of Devolution (which shares many of the same faults and considerably more highlights).It is, unfortunately, quite boring and less than passionate in the vast majority of cases. The exceptions are ""I'm Not Dreaming of You"", ""Aimee"" and the title track. But even they would be weak tracks on Zehn, let alone Monosex, World Without End or Void. I commend all of the above to interested listeners."
3,"Okay, But...","....to it's credit this collection has a few of Gap's later radio list hits like the theme to ""I'm Gonna Get You Sukka"". But, with those edits cut for singles, it leaves the listener wanting. Better to find the uncut, full time versions and 12"" versions especially for ""Burn Rubber On Me"" and ""You Dropped A Bomb on Me"". That, again, is my humble opinion which I feel is from a buyer's standpoint."
5,Gap Attack,"back in the day if you wanted a Summer Jam to Dance to you knew that the Gap Band would be one of the few Acts that would give up the Goods Yearly.they always had a Jam.""Outstanding"",""Party Train"",""You Dropped a Bomb on Me"",etc..the Sound here help pave the way for New Jack Swing.and so many Singers have made a Career off of Charlie Wilson's Signature Vocals.Grooves&Vocals that are still as Fresh now as when they came out."
4,Not a Bomb,"Great tunes great group. Very underated Soul Rock. You Dropped a Bomb on Me, Early in the Morning, and Burn Rubber (why you wanna hurt me) being the classics!"
1,Great machine Short term/Not great long term,"I've had 2 of these machines in the last 6 months. There's a reason for the 90 day lamp warranty. If you're lucky like I was, your lamp will burn out before you get to 90 days. One day past that & you'll be paying $300+ for a replacement. Given the initial investment + the $300.00 every 3 months for a new bulb, I'd say this product is barely worth 1 star. The quality of the product is great is you only need it for 90 days. Beware of DLP projectors, especially the SHARP!!!"
2,poor bulb,"Our church also had gotten this unit, only using it on Sundays. Had it for under one year and the bulb went. Said it had 72% left on it, hardly no where close to 2000-3000 hrs. life. Not happy with bulb."
3,"Good, but...","....this DVD does NOT teach you the stroke step by step from the beginning. This DVD is most useful if you already have a certain amount of skill with each on the strokes and want to refine your TECHNIQUE. In terms of refining your technique, this DVD does a good job."
4,Graceful butterfly,"Agree with Angela, this dvd is for those already possessing some skill but wanting to refine technics. It is not for amateurs.Kaitlin's perfect butterfly technic is so graceful, it doesn't look strenuous that I take that vision to the pool and practice. Another plus point is it can be watched over and over again without being bored with too many instructions."
1,pan won't season,"I love cast iron cookware, but this pan won't work for me. I seasoned it as instructed but the muffins just wouldn't come out cleanly. Trying to clean it afterwards was a nightmare. I couldn't get the stuck bits out of the corners."
5,The only way to make cornbread! Built like a tank!,"Anyone that loves cornbread loves the edges and this pan gives every piece more edges!!The key to this pan is to properly season it per the Lodge instructions before using it. Yes, the seasoning process takes a little time and can potentially stink up your kitchen for an hour, but once you get it right, this product is a dream to use. The more you use it, the more seasoned it becomes, and the easier it is to cook with. Until it is good and black from use, I would suggest using a non-stick spray before putting your cornbread batter in to help keep things from sticking.Lodge products are extremely well made and will last a lifetime... or several for that matter if you pass it down to your kids one day."
5,Unusual usage,I use these cornbread pans for lead ingot moulds. They workvery well as long as you let the temperature drop below 300Fbefore expecting the ingots to drop out. Much better thanmuffin tins.Do not bang to get ingots out! Cast iron shatters!
5,HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO USE THIS ONE!,"Great to have crust all around on your cornbread slice!!!You have to spray the pan really, really well with cookingspray then heat it before you put the batter in to allow thecornbread to come out in one piece. I run a little spatulaaround the edges before I dump the pan. Gave one as a giftat Christmas and it was a hit!!!!"
2,Lodge Original Finish Cast Iron Eight-Section Cornbread Skillet,ok for cornbread but NOT at all for scones
1,"Had it, got rid of it","We sold it in a yard sale for a buck. We just couldn't get the seasoning right and got to frustrated after about the fifth batch gone bad. Did everything right, seasoned it, preheated when we went to use it, used extra oil in the mix and still didn't work. We use our chicken fryer for corn bread, works every time."
1,Not Practical,"I followed the directions to the letter and cured my new pan as instructed.It's a great idea, but it just doesn't work.The cornbread sticks to pan."
2,What's the use!,"I thought this was a good idea when I bought it. This feels like one heavy pan. I use cast iron skillets for just about all my cooking, including crepes. This pan feels heavier than any of them though I doubt it actually is. I had no troubles following the direction for seasoning the pan. All cast irons need proper seasoning. Once seasoned cast irons become semi-nonstick. I have not had any trouble with sticking. I did have a problem using the cornbread recipe that came with the pan. It more than filled the pan. To really be usefull you need to know how the capacity of the pan which is not provided. It looks like it would be great for scones too."
4,Worked great until it died.,I was feeding my comcast digital box and 3 PC tuner cards. It worked great for 3 weeks and then wouldn't power up any longer. I noticed on the day before it died that a progam recorded on Win MCE was very noisy. Next day.......dead. They are slow to replace a product and ship back to you Fedex ground from South Carolina. That takes 5-7 business days. So the turn around will be over 2 weeks. What worries me is that the tech ask me to do some odd things to prove it was dead. Not use it close to a plasma TV. Not have all the outputs used. So I am concerned now that this amp is touchy and not up to powering the 8 outputs is has.I will report back when I get the replacement unit.boxer
5,Channel Plus DA08200,"I have had a number of Channel Plus products in the past, and all have worked well for me. This product was no exception. It is small, easy to install and simple to use. I particularly like the ability to plug in a modulated signal - this unit has two modulator ports. It works great with Channel Plus modulators. I have one installed that puts a camera on one channel and the output from my DVD-R on the other so I can watch my DVDs (or the input signal to the DVDR) in every room of the house. I recommend this product highly.David Brown [...]"
2,Limited life span,The complete systems allows viewing of all channels and remote control at up to eight locations. Great concept except the amps die just after the warranty expires. I'm on my fourth amp and they consistently die at around 18 to 24 months. Too bad. Could have been a great system.
5,Donny's Star Still Shines Brightly,"Donny Osmond is back stronger than ever with what I consider his best work to date, ""This Is The Moment"". The songs are all classic and contemporary Broadway fare, but with an interesting and suprising pop twist. Even if you aren't really a Broadway buff or fan, you'll enjoy this CD. Donny's smooth, strong voice is used to it's advantage here.The strongest tracks are the title track, the beautiful song ""This Is The Moment"" from 'Jekyll And Hyde', ""Immortality"" from 'Saturday Night Fever', and the absolutely gorgeous duet with Vanessa Williams ""Not While I'm Around"" from 'Sweeney Todd'. The whole CD is brilliantly arranged and produced.I also love his renditions of ""Seasons Of Love"" from 'Rent' and ""No Matter What"" from 'Whistle Down The Wind'. The weakest track I think is ""You've Got A Friend In Me"" from 'Toy Story'. It just never grabbed me and I could do without Rosie O'Donnell singing.This is definately Donny Osmond's moment !"
5,Like an old friend,"I have thoroughly enjoyed this cd. Hearing Donny sing again is like renewing an acquaintance with an old friend. Once again, he proves that he is a talented musician and still a superstar! I have been a Donny Osmond fan for over thirty years now, having plastered my walls with his posters in the 70's. This Donny Osmond cd brought back some wonderful memories of a very happy time."
5,As Beautiful As Ever,"Donny Osmond shines once again in this new CD. The songs he sings are so beautiful and having him sing them makes the songs even more beautiful. I had never heard several of those songs before, but they are really great to listen to if you want to just sit back and relax. Rosie O'Donnell sings one of the songs with Donny (""You've Got a Friend in Me"" from ""Toy Story"") the two of them are great. If you are a Donny Osmond fan, this is the CD to own! You will not regret it."
5,This is his Moment!,"Wow! I thought I'd miss the old Donny Osmond standards, but this CD proves what a musical talent this man is! He has come full circle and knows who he is and has given us another avenue to hear his best. I commend him for ""going out on a limb"" and recording songs that he wasn't known for. I love this CD and have just about worn it out! I'm looking forward to his next release. The CD is worth every penny!"
4,Just Donny. D-O-N-N-Y.,"I work with 2 old ladies, and they LOVE this album!! They say he reminds them of early Bing Crosby. I have to say that I don't get it, but Donny is all they talk about. They say they're lives would be boring and lonely if Don wasn't around. Read the other reviews if you don't believe me. And check out Carly Simon's ""Boys in the Trees"" if you like this one. There is definitely something going on over there. Hey Now!!!"
4,"Get over ""little"" Donny Osmond","It is time for the music industry to get over Donny's teenage image. This is a very good collection of Broadway tunes. Donny does an excellent job of taking the ""old"" songs and updating them and doing the songs in a style that makes the old new. The track, ""Not While I'm Around"", a duet with Vanessa Williams is supurb! The duet with Rosie O'Donnell, ""You've Got a Friend In Me"", is really fun. You can tell they had a good time recording this. As a matter of fact, you can tell Donny had a good time recording these songs. My personal favorite is, ""No Matter What"". I recommend this CD even to those that were not a fan of Donny when he was a ""teen idol"". Here is Donny, an adult and having fun and entertaining. You'll enjoy this if you give it a chance!!"
1,disappointing :-(,"I am a Donny Osmond fan (he was great in Joseph), so having to give his latest album this low of a rating is painful.Donny is a wonderful singer, but his voice cannot shine through when it is covered up by the dismal pop-music orchestration. All of the songs (Except the duet with Rosie) are classic showtunes, and deserved a larger (not necessarily full) band or orchestra to back them up--*not* the electronic mishmash that they actually received.Call this the album that could have been...And go listen to Harry Connick's newest album."
3,A dissapointed Donny Fan,"I had high hopes for this album. I have been a Donny Osmand fan since ""Soldier of Love"". However, this album is vapid and banal. Only a couple of the songs; ""I'm not in Love"" and ""Could it be I'm Falling in Love"" are worthy covers. I am still a loyal fan and sometimes even the greats have thier flops, this is Donny's. Well, maybe next time."
1,He's done better,"I was there when the Osmond Brothers became popular, like most young girls of the day I very much liked listening to Donny and his brothers. I still enjoy their and his music. I have seen Donny in Joseph 7 times. I even saw him in Little Johnny Jones. I have heard him sing with passion and emotion. I'm sad to say, I don't hear it in this collection of Broadway songs. If you want to complete your collection of Donny Osmond records, buy this CD. If you want a good Broadway album, find another. I listened to this CD on three different sound systems thinking that was the fault. Donny's voice is lost under the instrumentations and electronics. He can have a powerful and articulate voice, but it is lost on this recording. I very much enjoy the work of Donny Osmond and I adore Broadway. I hope he tries again and lets his voice ring true."
5,Two Very Enthusiastic Thumbs Up,"I have followed Donny Osmond since I was a little boy, I am 23 now and he still sounds great. I LOVE broadway music as a whole and so when I heard that Donny was going to record broadway music I was excited because broadway is cool. I especially like the touches he put on ""Immortality"" and I think the song he does with Vanessa Williams(another one of my favorite performers) from the play ""Sweeney Todd"" is marvelous, and the title track is great too, I give this cd two very enthusiastic thumbs up, you will not be disappointed because Donny gives it his all and makes you wish you were on Broadway."
3,Uneventful,"The concept of the book(s) itself was good. I enjoyed reading into more than one character's life during the same period in time. However, I found the whole book, uneventful, and boring. I feel the author did not fulfill the female character's 'realness' in her narration. It's a male author's version of a females thoughts, feelings, and conversations. And with that, the female character's chapter is not compelling, insightful, nor does it have a bit of true emotion. I was very disappointed in the end."
1,"Well, at least the package says catnip","I bought 3 packets of these seeds. One packet went in a pot, the second went in an outside planting bed, and the third i kept to pot plant again after harvesting the first batch. About 1/8 of the seeds i planted in the pot sprouted and grew, while the outside planted seeds did NOTHING. However, the ones that did sprout in the pot were obviously NOT catnip. What came up was something way different looking than what's depicted on the packet (actual catnip). I also know it's not catnip because it did absolutely nothing for my cats.Also, the reviewers who claimed they didn't get anywhere near the promised 200 count of seeds per packet, mine also shared the same plight. A generous estimate as to how many seeds i actually got in each packet would have to be somewhere around 20-25.So it's a double whammy here folks: only 25 out of the 200 promised seeds per packet and they're not even catnip. Get your catnip seeds from SOMEBODY ELSE!!!"
1,2 out of 200 seeds ????,"Well i am really mad --- i had 2 of the 200 seeds sprout in summer 2011 [ yes, i planted cat nip in the past and i know how to grow it with my other plants ] BUT THIS DID NOTHING AT ALL ... my plants were like 1.75 inches tall .... and a cat ate the plants -- so i got none at all ..... LOT #04WB - TEST DATE 09/10 - SELL BY 03/2013 .... save you $$ i guess plant hemp seeds ... u will yield better"
5,Excelent work!,"I am a 16 year old Latina that just read Yasmin's first few pages of her book and fell in love with it. I could not let go, every page was full of amazing advise and encouraging words. I can really relate to Yasmin's life and pasion for life. Her book inspired me to become a more educated women and extremely proud of being and empowered Latina. In this book she talks about her struggle with drugs, violence, discrimination, and the dad that's a ""Macho"" who wants to control the household. She finally breaks through and wins so many battles through out her life. If you're a Latina that has pasion and ganas then read this book to motivate you even more.Arriba mis Latinas!"
5,Made for train sets,We have had Brio products for many years and they hold up well. Children in wide age range enjoy these products. They are not meant for really young children as the pieces are small enough to be used with the train sets. Keepings that in mind -- high recommended.
2,Have to replace the batteries,Nice toy and good addition to the collection but don't expect the lights and siren to work due to the batteries not being protected
1,Tiny pieces!,"This ambulance is tiny! When it was advertised as battery operated, and came in a 10"" box, I thought this was an ambulance my toddler can push around on the floor and have it make noises. Instead it's perfect for putting in his mouth and choking!"
