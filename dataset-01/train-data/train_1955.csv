4,Logitech 2.4 GHz Cordless Presenter,"I thoroughly enjoy this presentation device. It's got a lot of great functionality in one little ergonomic form. The only downside was that I had a bit of trouble with it loosing it's connectivity to the actual computer the second time I was trying to use it. Haven't had the problem since then, so I'm assuming that it was just a temporary glitch."
4,Happy with Product,"I am an Adjunct Professor at two local universities and regularly use Power Point Presentations. This product is easy to install and use. In the last 60 days, it has performed flawlessly. It does the noted functions well and I am satisfied with the purchase."
5,Amazing Product ...,"As with almost every other Logitech product, this one doesn't disappoint. While it is almost twice as expensive as its nearest competitor, it is worth every penny.Installation was a snap and required no additional drivers. Volume control is an innovative feature, even though most powerpoint presentations don't have embedded audio or video. The Laser pointer is useful as well and goes a long distance, which is handy when you are presenting in a large room.Also, I liked the range that I could use it at. It does in fact work up to 50 feet as long as you don't have any large object obstructing the signal from the hand held remote.Overall, I think it is a great buy and looks like has secured a permanent place in my laptop bag for years to come."
5,Best Cookbook Ever,I use this cookbook almost every meal I make for my family. Easy to follow recipes that call for commonly used ingredients. Very well organized...and I love how it's put together in the three-ring-binder.
2,New Year's Eve Disaster,"I purchased this book new. While it has wonderful information on cooking information (measurements, appliances, etc.), I tried 3 recipies for a New Year's Eve dinner. The Lemony Antipasta was good. However, the Chicken Strata and the Chicken and Sausage Paella went down in flames. Preparation was easy; costs of ingredients reasonable. Flavor-wise, both dishes were so bland, they were virtually tasteless. And the 5 ounce package of saffron-flavored rice is not sufficient for the paella; 3 packages would have been adequate. I won't throw the book away because of the valuable cooking information. But I won't try anymore of the book's recipes. And I'm not a cooking beginner; I'm quite 'seasoned'. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. And I'm writing a letter to Better Homes and Gardens."
1,Pink Plaid,"I bought this book because my late 70's Better Homes Cookbook was seriously falling apart. Since I am a breast cancer survivor, I decided to go with the Pink Plaid Edition. I was hoping the Pink Plaid would be a good replacement, but I'm not at all happy with it. Many of the wonderful recipes in my old book are gone. The few recipes I did try, I didn't like at all. Many of the recipes included, in this edition, are not the types of foods my family will eat. This book seems to have far more fluff and less recipes than the books of yesteryear. I purchased the Pink Plaid cookbook ONLY a year ago and the 5-ring binder has came loose from the back of the book's hard cover. The broken binder is not from overuse, as I've only used it a few times. I am again looking for a replacement."
5,long time friends,I purchased this cookbook for my daughter that is getting married. I know she will love it an depend on it as I do. I have been using my original BH cookbook for 33 years and still use it weekly. The pink cover is lovely and of course we as women should support Breast Cancer Awareness.
5,Best Basic Cookbook EVER!,My mom purchased the original version of this cookbook for me over 25 years ago and I have used it more than any other.Now this new updated version with a healthy focus is even better than the original.A great gift of anyone - including yourself.
3,Confusing Index,"As a breast cancer survivor, I received this book as a Christmas gift. The recipes from survivors in the front of the book are not included in the index in the back nor are they listed individually in the front. It is as if they were just stuck in to fill space. I bought ingredients for one of the breast cancer recipes and then I had a hard time finding where it was. The rest of the recipes in the book are grouped together in a very confusing manner."
3,Great book,"Had it before and gave it to my daughter, wasn't sure I could get another but found it online. This is a good cookbook and now both my daughters and I have one."
1,BETTER HOMES AND GARDEN SPECIAL EDITION,"I sent for the book. It was a gift and she sent it back, because it was broke from the biding and broken and completely smashed."
5,great,it was great service was received in great shape and fast. it was for a birthday and was in time. thank you
5,Great Cookbook!,This is my absolute favorite cookbook. All of the recipes are fairly simple and have easy to follow instructions. I also love the section in the back with healthier recipes. I haven't made anything in this cookbook that wasn't delicious!
3,"Great recipes, but...","I can't deny that the recipes are, for the most part, terrific. But, that said, I must comment on the loose-leaf binder format. Yes, it's convenient to lay it flat while in use, but the pages will not hold up very well unless you stick reinforcements on each and every page, both front and back. Just the thought of doing that is overwhelming...check out how many pages are in this cookbook, now multiply that number by six. WHEW! That's a truckload of reinforcements, ya' think? I know they put it out in a spiral-bound version, but I'm having trouble finding that. When I do, this edition will be turned over to my DD."
3,"Good, but not as good as some.","I instantly picked this up after finishing ""Summon the Keeper"" by the same author. I was mildly disappointed. Perhaps it was the lower humor content, but I'm also usually into serious stories. This was a very good book with an intelligent plot, but it felt too unsubtle. The characters were likeable, and the angel was a fascinating creature. I was most definitely interested in what would happen to them, but the resolution seemed to come out of nowhere. It's really hard for me to pinpoint the specific reason that I wasn't enthralled by ""Gate of Darkness, Circle of Light,"" but it was a chord with a note missing somewhere."
2,An okay performance of a great French opera,Richard Bonynge missed an opportunity to give a great new performance of Adam's Le Toréador. This is an okay performance that simply does not measure up to the 1958 Musidisc performance of the French Radio Lyric Orchestra. Mady Mesplé is so much better than Sumi Jo... Find the old CD if you can.N. A. Peppas
5,The Closer,"Very well done just the right amount of suspence and humor. I had missed this show the passed seasons and I plan on watching the rest of them,very glad it was part of my prime membership"
4,Southern Jewish History,"For anyone who grew up in the South, especially if they were middle class Jewish this is a very accurate picture of their youth. It's an informative very easy read...and the new introduction in this addition adds to the story."
3,Jewish Culture in the South,"The Provincials is a history of Jews in the South. It is the story of outsiders who came into a xenophobic society and, through hard work and assimilation, became accepted and valued members of Southern society. When Evans sticks to this topic, The Provincials is a well written, solid piece of history and sociology. Unfortunately, he does waver from his major theme quite a bit, focusing too much on his personal family history. He also spends a huge amount of time talking about Atlanta, a city which many of us in the south consider to be an anomaly in that it has lost much of its flavor as a southern city. I'm not sure how he can justify so much space for Atlanta and barely mention Miami. Much of the unrelated material appears late in the book, which makes me think that it was an afterthought to an earlier draft or edition of the book. Even with these negative facets, the book is a fascinating read about a minority within a majority."
3,Inexpensive Keyboard Works Well,"Keyboard is well laid out and has useful function keys, but (i) is pretty flat and (ii) the volume control lacks any graphical or tactile indication of how much the volume is changing."
4,GET THIS BOOK FREE ONLINE,"It's an excellent resource for taking responsibility for oral health care. And it's registered with the Library of Congress, so search online and download the pdf for free!"
3,Nothing new,"This is an old book. The info in it on how to avoid large dental bills has been around for quite some time. The steps for doing such include buying a ""good"" toothbrush, flossing w/tape instead of thread, brushing w/powder instead of paste, and irrigating. This protocol has been touted by dentists for decades. Also, doing these things does not guarantee you will be successful in avoiding large dental bills."
2,Weird advice,"So basically this guy says all you need to be 100% cavity free is to use dental tape (sounds like dental floss to me) every day - you don't even need to brush! But then I think - ""how would dental tape or floss remove the food on the tops of my teeth, especially in the back?"" the answer is it won't so I really don't get it."
5,Greatest documentary in years,"Greatest Video Game movie ever. Greatest Doc ever. 3rd greatest movie ever. Fan of Tetris, video games or not, this is worth every penny."
3,Great glasses while they last; poor warranty service,"I purchased these glasses about 1 1/2 years ago. They were great glasses, however I recently had the frame break on me. The plastic that surrounds the screw holding the side arm to the front of the glasses broke. I sent the glasses back to Native and paid their $30 warranty fee. In response they (presumably on accident) sent me back another pair of broken glasses! Numerous delays and emails later, I still have the ""new"" pair of broken glasses and am out $30.While I enjoyed the glasses while they lasted, I am now looking for a new pair that is higher in quality and, should the need arise, is backed by a more competent warranty department."
4,Island Music,"This was a good CD, and what we were looking for before taking our cruise this winter to the islands in the Caribbean. We played it quite a few times and still enjoy it. Maybe we could find more steel drum music?"
3,no handles on the lid,I received this as a gift and have already burned my hands several times because the lid is glass and has no handles to remove the lid off the base. When you lift the lid the steam that escapes burns you. You have to use pot holders to remove the lid and they get in the food. The lid gets very hot.
4,Very supportive!,This is book is being used within Teacher Development and Professional Development Programs - I love the advice pages and the fact that I can skip around the book finding exactly what is needed in certain situations.
2,Save your Money,"I received this book from my school district as a new teacher, and I was fairly disappointed by the lack of substance. It seems like a potpourri of random ideas the author compiled over time. Many of the ideas are valid, but there isn't much novelty in the book."
2,Graphic to cover up a lack of substance,"My school district distributed this text and the mandatory inservice training to all teachers new to the county. At first glance, the book appears helpful, but upon closer inspection it is a disappoinment. The text is set in large font and is graphically arranged to cover up a lack of substance. When the author actually pulls research into the discussion, it is superficial and not adequately explained. Although many of Rutherford's strategies are effective and applicable to various levels, the majority of the material presented in this book appear to be rehashed versions of what effective teachers - and anyone who has gone through a college ed program in the past ten years - already know and do. All in all, I DID learn this in college and I didn't need a beginner's ed book to tell me about it again."
2,Very Basic,"This book did not meet my expectations. The information is extremely basic and is a review of college education courses. Although this book would be helpful, it could very easily be replaced with college texts."
3,Problems w/ RD-7106 but good support from Sherwood,After dealing with mounting problems with this unit for months I called Sherwood tech support and received excellent service. Sherwood offers alot for a good price when it comes to their multimedia receivers. I'd definately buy from them again.
1,this reciever is [not good],I have had nothing but problems with this reciever - I read lots of good reviews before I bought it but now regret that I did. It has been 1 thing wrong after the other and the quality is not really any better than my old Kenwood KR-A46 which doesn't have surround sound capabilities or any of the features that made the Sherwood so appealing.
4,Seiko Watch,I was looking for a watch that had actual numbers on the face for a change of pace and this one fits the bill. The white background is something I had never tried before and I like it. It was only $68 dollars which was a steal in my opinion for a nice watch like this.
1,garbage,Two of the siren settings are exactly the same. Dont buy. Ok for kids i guess. If you are an adult get the bike air horn not this. The only thing Super about this horn is that its Super Gaudy and Super Gay. Not for anyone over 5 years old.
3,No much here,"Well, I did find this book informative, but only to a short extent. Most of the particulars written about in this book, I already knew either from another book published before this one or was what I thought to be common knowledge. Don't get me wrong the book taught a few things but, this is nothing to write home to ma about."
5,A great quotation collection for liberals,"This is a fairly thin collection of quotations but it is worth the buy for anyone who considers themselves a liberal. If you are conservative, I can guarentee you will hate this book. It covers many topics and they are easy to find in this nicely organized collection. It does mainly live up to its title because I did enjoy most of the quotes that the author picked in this collection. It's a nice little stocking stuffer or addition to a quotation collector's library."
4,"Solid trainer, weak LCD","I have the machine for over month now, been on it almost daily. It is a solid elliptical and I like the multiple programs that came with the computer, but the LCD display has bad contrast. The navigation on the computer unit can use some work. It is not easy at all to switch from one user to another. The owner's manual lacks details, I expect something this expensive to have lots more materials on creating exercises and workout plans."
5,Impressive!,"I love this machine. I have been spoiled by Precor units at the 24 hour fitness I used to go to, and was worried I wouldn't like a ""home use"" machine as well. Turns out, I love it!! It feels just as sturdy as Precor. I figured it had to be, because of the lifetime frame warranty. I love the workout just as much as I loved using the Precor at the gym. It's just as smooth, and has the same action and range that I was used to. My only reccomendation is that this wouldn't be a great unit for folks who are 'height challenged'. I'm 5'9"", and the range is okay for me, but the misses is a little shorter, and she has to stretch a little with it. But she does like how quiet it is. She can watch her soaps while I exercise and not get annoyed. After all the years we've been married, that in itself is a lifesaver. ;)"
1,"Table is nice, but broken","Received the table, and really like it, but one side was cracked during the manufacturing process. Don't know if machines put in the screws or people, but one side was split right where the screw joins the side to the top.Very heavy for me--and don't feel like the hassle of returning it. I like it otherwise."
3,Good product! Bad packaging!,"Product: 5 Stars.... outstanding fragance!Packaging: External packaging was too big.... But, the worst part was internal packaging which was a mess.... Perfume package itself was defective and was repaired with tape. There are not polite words to describe it!"
2,Not very good...,"A hodgepodge story with wayward and silly plot points. Rachel McAdams is a doll, but Michael Peña may be the worst actor working today."
2,A Road Trip Not Worth Viewing,"A cliche-ridden ""road trip"" flick with a less than subtle anti-war, anti-military agenda which is to be expected given the presence of Tim Robbins. On the plus side, it does have some humorous and inspirational moments, but overall, not worth going out of your way for."
3,"OK formula film, i.e. the journey that becomes psych'ly deep, etc.","There are so many films like this, some people thrown together in a circumstance - this one coming home from the Iraq War to some bad surprises - and they become friends while traveling and find new meaning. While the actors are quite wonderful, something about it didn't quite ring true for me and there was nothing whatsoever original about it. There are borderline ridiculous many comedic scenes, but the tone is more serious than not. You can't have frolicsome tragedy. McAdams is far too beautiful to be a normal grunt and Robbins' personal crisis is too predictable and conventional. Pena, I thought, was the best: a tightly wound guy who slowly started to fall apart later on. I also liked the presence of the killed boyfriend, who is a very real and evolving character thru the film. Unfortunately, I was kind of waiting for it to end.Recommended. There are some good parts in it, but it often just didn't work for me."
1,So many Romance films yet this one stands out as one of the worst,seriously dont buy it unless you loved it other wise be sure to turn a blind eye to this one
2,Not as good as it should be,"The ideas in this movie could be good, but this movie did not hit it on the head. Half of the movie seemed campy, kind of very cliched...I frequently found myself rolling my eyes or saying ""duh!"" while watching it. It also left with somewhat of a cliff hanger. This definitely did not do anything for the acting abilities of McAdams and Pena."
4,funny movie,I did not know this was a comedy when I bought it but it is a funny movie and I like it. Great cast.
3,Charlie Chan and The Curse of the Dragon Queen,Great Movie! Peter Ustinov made a great Charlie Chan. Great Twist at the end!
1,bad,this was a vert bad movie. It was not a real charlie chan movie. Very bad take off of the real charlie chan movies. No stars.
1,Just reading that Angie Dickenson is in this makes it a loser..,"When it comes to Charlie Chan with Sidney Toler and Roland Winters, this is blasphemy.I've never liked Angie Dickenson and any movie with her in it would be a negative rating if allowed. ""Police Woman"" is what did it for me."
3,Not for Beginners that Need How-Tos,"This book is beautifully illustrated, but not a How-To-Draw book.I first saw this book at school, in a friend's possession. I immediately asked to borrow it; I was utterly amazed at the illustrations. I was shocked at the details;not the instructions. The author tried to explain how to draw something as beautiful at those pieces of art, but failed epically. The instructions weren't useful, and I had failed attempts at all of the drawings. Also, if you have children, there is one picture in particular which is EXTREMELY inappropriate for children 16 and under."
3,Not Very Authentic Japanese Manga Style,"I give it an OK rating (3 out of 5). The book is thick, colorful, and full of different characters and monsters. It's also very cheap and made out of good materials.However, this is not what I would call authentic manga. The artists are great, don't get me wrong, but the artwork is simply not authentic Japanese comic style. Ever watched The Boondocks? Totally Spies? Though they may look anime (Japanese cartoon) style, it's simply not anime. Same goes with this book.I don't know about anybody else, but if I want to learn something, I want to learn from the real thing. However, if you just want to look at different styles to make your own, then this book is pretty decent. It's not a real ""how to"" book, but more of an illustrator with little comments on the sides."
2,Not for young children,"I bought this book for my 11-year-old daughter and was sadly disspointed. I probably should have done more in-depth research. This item is DEFINITELY NOT for younger viewers/drawers. There are MANY inappropriate images in here including everything from blood and gore to sexual parts. Also, my daughter says it does not really teach anything about drawing, it just shows a lot of pictures. I would not reccommend this as an instruction tool for young children."
3,More For Reference Than How-To...,"The majority of this book contains well done artwork both in end sketch and fully finished form. There is little here in the way of instruction so buying this book won't help you ""Draw Like the Experts"". This book would be great as reference material for ideas to use in your own artwork.The few pages (less than 4 I believe) near the end of the book about using a computer to color your drawings seem thrown in to keep this from being just a picture book. There are better books with more in depth detail on coloring art with a computer than what you'll find here."
3,More for advanced artists looking to up their game,"Nice artwork and good sized and put together book. However, this is not step by step instruction and is more for the artist who already has a style or a solid foundation and is looking to improve on that. Not a very good book for a beginer, though."
5,Very helpful,Monster book of manga helped me take my drawings to the next level so that i may improve. Enjoyed it and i still am.
4,good inspiration,"If looking for a few ideas to vary your work this is a good thought provoker. It has illustration from sketch to final and some of the steps in between. This is not a how to so dont purchase it looking for steps on how to draw this is more of a ""I already draw and want to see different styles"". I have looked through it and have gotten alot of good ideas from it."
2,Ehh,If you want to draw real manga/anime this is not the book for you. Even though it has many pages there isn't alot of cool things to draw. I want to return it later this week or give it away
2,Not impressed,I thought that a book entitled the Monster Book of Manga would have a lot more art in it. I was disappointed.
3,It was okay..,Book does have alot of visuals but it's not very informative. It's not for beginners but more advanced artists.
1,Don't Even Bother To Even Read It,"my sister got this from my sister for christma i agree with the reviews before me. it looks like crappy cartoons. they don't even look like anime or manga. they look like dolls. they show nudity. they just show you pictures of how to draw the body but they dont show you how to draw hands, feet and ect. the nudity is very disgusting and i wont not give this to a child."
1,Not for Kids,I bought this book for my daughter. It was very disappointing to find that it contained nudity and even some bondage type pictures. I dont recommend it for kids at all.
1,If your looking for a how to draw manga book keep looking.,"When I got this book I looked throw it, Then sent it back. It's not that it was a a bad book It was just not for me. They tell you that it is a how to draw manga book but it is not manga at all! if you are looking for a how to draw ""Japanese"" manga you will not find it in this book. they style of manga this book has is way to Americanized and look like some kind of crappy flash cartoon. all I am saying it if you want to learn how to draw Japanese manga this book is not for you."
2,Not so monstrous.,"This Book is an excellent book if you like to look at pictures other people have drawn, but not if you are just starting out. it doesnt really give any in depth ways to draw. Sure, the artist gives you how he did the drawing but it doesnt give any real advice it. For instance it will say ""make sure to give a shy look on her face"" and show how he did it, but never really gives any suggestions on ways to do so. The book also didnt contain nearly enough pictures to be considered ""monster"". About the only useful section I found in this book was the very small Photoshop section in the back."
3,It's Okay,"The book, in my opinion, is less useful for actual lessons and better for inspiration and learning what you can from observation. It still helps but not as much as other How-To books that are out there. The price was good and I don't mind having it in my collection, like i said, it does have it uses but if I didn't buy it I don't think I'd lose any sleep over it."
4,Wouldn't recommend for younger teens,I purchased this book for my daughter and was glad I flipped through it before giving it to here there are several almost pornographic pictures in the book I wish I had known that before buying it. Other than that it I feel this book would be great to use for anyone wanting to draw Manga.
2,Dont buy if you want to learn something,"I really regret wasting money on this. I should have read more of the reviews but I just bought it in my haste to get a new how to draw book. It says draw like the experts, but you pretty much have to already be an expert to use this book. It gives a few helpful tips and has some interesting characters but overall I do not like this book and will either be returning it or selling it so I can get a better book. It's a good buy if your looking for inspiration for drawing scantily clad anime girls in sexy poses but not if your an ametuer looking for some guidance. The art is good and it has some interesting characters but overall not a good buy and I regret it."
4,A wonderful journey into a young girl's life,"I remember reading this book as a little girl and not being able to put it down. In fact, the copy that I had was so tattered that I had to tape the cover together--I read it that often. I found the book to be a real pleasure. THe story is told from Trissy's point of view, as we are readers of her diary, which is typed on a typewriter given to her by her father. Complete with typos and spelling mistakes that really makes you feel as though you are reading the diary of a young girl, I, Trissy is a fabulous read for young readers."
5,It's a keeper!!,"Was excited to find such a machine at a decent price on Amazon. Have copied about 15 taped to DVD so far and haven't had a problem yet. Only complaint I have is the instrustion book is a little confusing. I guess being male and actually having to read it to get it to operate hurt my ego somewhat,but I quickly recovered and put the book down and went on instinct.Big fingers on the small remote keys is a little cumbersome when putting titles on the DVD but I learned to adapt(Had my wife do it) Hmmmmm... not bad huh. Have not tried DVD to VHS asthat's not what I want to record. All I have to do is put at VHStape in and a blank DVD in and come back in 2 or 3 hours and adda title and finalize it and I'm done. I love it."
3,"DVD-R/RW only - no PhotoCD, VCD, SVCD playback","I was surprised to discover that this brand new unit cannot playback VCDs (VideoCDs) or PhotoCDs. Usually only VERY old DVD players can't play VCDs. Odd!Won't matter to most folks, but VideoCDs are a nice way to archive say 3 sitcoms or Simpsons shows to a CD-R with good quality and near zero cost.Unit is the Low Price Leader and works OK, feels a little cheap, remote confusing. Other units can playback more formats."
2,It Worked Fine for Awhile But,"Besides the fact that the instruction manual has to be one of the longest I've ever seen, the directions on how to convert VHS tapes to DVD weren't as simple as I had thought they would be. After finally figuring it out, thanks to the help of Sylvania's 800 number, I then had trouble using DVD-R discs. Another phone call to Sylvania later, the service rep said I had to use DVD-RW discs until they sent me an upgrade disc that I would have to install with their help. Two weeks later, I still haven't received the disc. Meanwhile, I was able to convert 5 tapes to the DVD-RW discs successfully after which the machine has stopped working. As I said, I'm still waiting for the upgrade disc which will supposedly solve all these problems. At this point, I'm not sure this was worth the money spent."
1,Appalling piece of machinery,"Funai makes horrible DVD recorders. I tried 3 and encountered everything from them not reading disks to the trays on the DVD not working. Unfortunately, most people are not aware they sell the same VCR/DVD recorder under 3 names at different prices: Emerson, Sylvania and Symphonic."
5,Recording DVD's is awesome,"Very good DVD recording ability. I've been recording 3 movies to each DVD-RW, and they play back in excellent quality. I have dubbed one VHS to DVD, and I'd say the quality was just 'good', but still probably what I expected. I did learn after my purchase that there are DVD-RW discs, and DVD+RW discs. This will not work with a DVD+RW, so depending on the future of DVD will determine whether this recorder is right for you. I have just accepted I'm going to live in a DVD-RW world, so as long as it's supported, this is an excellent product."
1,Don't buy this model,"We bought this model on 6/14 - it has been in the repair shop ever since. All we get when we call is ""We're waiting for a part"". So far - we haven't been able to use the machine at all. While trying to install it - parts just broke off - so this model is very flimsily constructed. When going by the repair shop - we see many of these machines sitting, waiting for repair. Highly recommend you buy some other - better constructed - machine."
1,Never got to use it,"The product looked pretty good except for the dings in them, and I what I mean buy them, is that, I got two of of them because Discount Jungle whom sent them to me was good about sending me another one after first one was damaged when I received it via ""UPS"". Then the second one I got was damaged worse than the fist one. I thought that ""UPS"" stood for United Parcel Service not ""United Parcel Smashers"". So, never got to use the product just returned them."
3,"VCR portion is lousy/Upgraded to read 8x discs, now it's fin","The first day I set it up, the VCR portion was not working properly. If you try to insert a VCR tape with a bit of force, it would get stuck and you would have problems getting it ejected. Other than the VCR portion, the dubbing from VCR tape to DVD and recording a TV show on DVD seems to be pretty good. I've only used a cheap media from Fry's GQ brand and the machine has recognized it with no problem. Other than the VCR portion, I'd give this machine for what you pay a five star. However, since I still have a rented VHS tape stuck in the VCR, I give it a 3 star.In reading other reviews, I also called Funai's service support and received the firmware upgrade and they walked me thru to upgrade it to receive 8x discs. Now I am very happy. I give it a 4 star only because the DVD player does not read VCD discs and also the VCR portion, make sure you don't rewind to the end because it will get stuck."
4,A Good Performer for The Price,"I bought this to make copy of old family video in VHS and Hi8 formats. I am very happy with the results and like to recommend to people who are in the market for DVD recorder.Great- Intuitive once master the basic concepts- RCA amd S-Video connectiors are available in the back panel as well as backpanel- Progressive scan produces excellent quality even in SP mode (on level below the best)- Comprehensive feature sets - just look at the user manual- DVD-R format allows play on most DVD players- Can be used to record TV programs saved on DVRNot so great- The remote control is very busy and not intuitive - intimidating for beginners- Does not record on 8X disc - only 4X only- Start dropping images when buffer memory is filled during long recording sessions (> 2 hours in my experience) - 10% of my recording has to be repeatedGenerally speaking, it is a great product for the money and I look forward to a double layer version in the near future."
1,Service very questionable,I would not buy this item again. I have been without my unit for over 4 months. It would not dub to dvd the second time I used it so I dropped it off at the factory auth. service center and have not gotten it back yet.(I got it for Christmas) Funai Corp ( the owners of the Sylvania name) have questionable service reps on their toll free customer service line and their factory authorized service center was so busy that they did not start the repair of my unit for two months. Spend a little more and hope for better service is the lesson I take away with me.
3,Good DVD but bad VHS,"After only two months and not a great deal of use a child's VHS tape fresh out of the package tried to eject immediately after being loaded. But it wouldn't eject and then reloaded itself. This process continued over and over until the unit was unplugged from the wall. It also completely rewound a tape off the reel on a previous use (which I had thought was just an old tape becomming weak). Unit is now in the shop for removal of the tape and repair. The DVD functions seemed to work fine but could not create my own titles unless I limited myself to the letters a,d,g,j,etc. Used Memorex 1x-2x -RW with great success. Found no trouble getting these through Amazon at a good price. Based on other reviews I may have to stock up now."
3,Good. Almost very good.,"Products'instructions are generally easy to understand andperform. Unit operated well except for ""locking up"" on discsrecorded on the machine about 3/4 of the way through the disc.The VCR section works well without difficulties."
1,Sylvania DVR90VE DVD player/recorder,Warning!!! I have had nothing but trouble from the VCR on this machine. It eats tapes and now it won't even accept them. The owner's manual gives no hints for troubleshooting the VCR. What a waste of money!!!
4,Great buy,"I bought this from Amazon for an amazing $179. It arrived 4 days later, I plugged it in, and was recording on my Sony DVD-RW disc within minutes. A few things, such as how to do weekly recordings vs one time recording, aren't quite intuitive, which is the only reason I didn't give this 5 stars. I'd give it 4.5 if I could, am quite happy with it, especially for the price, and considering some of the negative posts about media compatibility, which hasn't been an issue for me."
1,Disks Don't Work,"After reading and re-reading manual, I am unable to find a disk that works. I have all the disks as shown in their manual but no where can I find a ""4x, 8x"" etc. Called company and they are supposed to send upgrade disk in 10-12 working days. Very disappointing when you can't use something out of the box. I have DVD-R up to 8x compatible from Staples, DVD-R (R4.7 )from Imation, CR-R from Imation. These are all listed in manual on page 43 as usuable disks. Why doesn't the company just send an upgrade disk along with equipment when they know it won't work without it. Poor,poor image of Funai Corp. Don't know at this point if I want to send the whole mess back to Amazon. One star is for being able to view VCR tapes."
1,WARNING--DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!,"I purchased this recorder from Amazon, and now I find out that it is incompatable with all of the new 8X DVD-R dics that are coming out. These new disks are supposed to be downward compatible (work with 1X thru 8X), but not on this recorder. The old 4X are being phased out in favor of the better, AND LESS EXPENSIVE, 8X variety, and are very hard to find. I confirmed all this with Sylvania tech support. They just said: ""We do apologize for the misunderstanding and any inconvenience."""
2,Eats the VHS tapes,"I've had the DVR90VE unit for about six months. The tape side has begun to eat tapes. Now, it will accept a tape, but will not play or eject the tape. So much for the VHS->DVD dubbing capability.Tried unplugging and letting it sit, etc. No luck.When it worked it did an adequate job, but I expected to get more than six months of use out of this machine.The DVD recording quality is OK, but not the best I've seen.I wouldn't waste money on it, but find a more reliable model."
3,I just bought another one,"UPDATE: Dec.16, 2005I meant to give this item ***** (5 Stars) Evidently!I JUST ordered my second Sylvania DVR90VE. Since I have used my original purchase (from ""Amazon"")for almost a year and a half without any problems.Not only does the duplicating(copying)features work great, but playing all my new and old DVD's and all my 40+years old VHS that I had recorded over those years also viewed great,even on my new LDS HD Ready TV.The greatly reduced ""Amazon"" price and ""Amazon"" standing behind all their sales, was also a factor in makng my decision to order another one.Joe"
1,BAD Investment,"Do Not Buy this item!The funai corporation fails to stand behind their product, and provide accurate updated information.I also experienced major frustration with compatability issues because this is OLD TECHNOLOGY, last year's model. It is severely limited to 4x DVD-Rs, which are no longer available, even at Walmart. This, I discovered only after purchasing a spindle of 16x format. This limitation can only be discovered by trial and error, as there is no mention on the box, in the manual, or troubleshooting guides. The ""experts"" at funai take no responsibility for puting obsolete merchandise on the shelf. This has been very frustrating, and I think the unit will be returned. If you are reading this, you are one step ahead of me. Be warned!I wish I had read these reviews before I went shopping."
2,Failed at what I wanted to use it for,"I bought the machine to dub video tapes of my kids to DVD. The process is very simple and I will give it a plus for that. However, on the three tapes I tried to dub to DVD, the machine would stop dubbing and give an error message half way through the dubbing process that the tape could not be transferred. I called and e-mailed customer service which was not helpful at all. Both times they tried to tell me it was a copyrighted tape that could not be copied, which it was not. I returned the machine today very disappointed with the whole experience."
1,DOES NOT WORK AS DESIGNED!,"Maybe this machine is great for dubbing VHS to DVD, but as far as copying/editing DVDs, it is awful. I tried first in VR mode with playlist, and it would not recognize any of the editing I did in other machines. Than I tried in orginal format (still VR) and it would recognize it in other players, but skip chapters and whole segments were missing. Video mode? Also no go... I could get chapters (although only every ten minutes, not where I wanted them) but the sound was off from the video. Finally, I did it on a DVD-R instead of -RW, and lo and behold....it still messed up. The video and sound were off by several seconds. Tech support people are incredibly unhelpful....they were very nice, but had no idea how to make it work. Save your money and get a machine that works."
1,A mediocre machine. Buyer beware!,"I was unaware that the Memorex 8X discs I purchased would not work until I read other reviews, since this is the 3rd week I've been unable to contact Funai Corp.'s customer assistance. I tried to buy 4X discs and failed. They are out of date (as is this machine). The local Circuit City manager told me they stopped carrying 4X over a year ago. That's not the only problem: there is a very noisy fan rather than later,quieter heat dispersion and the VCR tuner does not provide the picture quality of my old Panasonic. I want to return this DVD recorder for a refund. What good is it to pay for a recorder if you cannot record!"
3,Good story but........,"Way too many English grammar errors (enough that it is distracting). If Mr. Harris used an editor, you couldn't prove it by me!"
4,New to cloth diapers,"Just switched over to cloth diapers. I didn't even know that premium meant size and not quality LOL! At first they seemed too long, but I just fold the extra in the front (we have a boy) and its working great. These diapers are dependable and cost effective. They pill in the beginning, but I understand that is chinese pre-folds across the board."
5,Da Bears!,Keep the Shuffle alive! Bears will go back to the Super Bowl and bring home the Lombardi once again. '85 Bears True monsters of the Midway!
4,1986 Chicago Bears Shuffle,"Fun. Upbeat. Funky. Feel good. This was the cherry on the top of the Bears Super Bowl season. The video and sound is dated - not even up to par for 1985. It would be nice if it could be enhanced a/v wise. It contains an 'OK' making of featurette. My only gripe about the content is the fact the QB Jim McMahon and RB Walter Payton (R.I.P.) didn't actually appear in the studio with the rest of the players on the video. Their performances were super imposed after the fact. I wonder if either of them regretted not going into the studio with the rest of the guys. For 10 bucks you could do worse with your entertainment dollar. For us, it's an annual event to re-watch this on Super Bowl Sunday. Kinda like watching ""A Chrismas Story"" as an anuual ritual."
5,love it,"I got this for my father as he was a huge fan of this team when I was growing up, even though we have lived in Indiana for 15 years and root for the Colts. This DVD still gets played for his grandchildren."
5,I am officially addicted!,"I started watching Drop Dead Diva in it's third season. I am officially addicted so am coming back to watch what I missed in the previous seasons. It's cute, warm, clean, smart, sometimes indulgently cheesy and absolutely perfect! In fact, it's so perfect, I just know that it will be taken off of the season line up soon. Anything that good without some vile and vulgar liberal agenda doesn't last long in TV land. But until then I'm going to enjoy!!"
4,Thought-provoking Music,"Her music is heartfelt and poignant. I loved it, especially the thought-provoking song ""Cherokee."""
2,"Yes, i own it - but i'll soon get rid of it","Her sound is beautiful, surely because of that her fans will take this disc without any further question. Sorry, but her Falla is very imprecise of vowels and little notes, and in the lieder she sounds as if she does not have a clue of what she is saying. Undefined vowels again, wrong stresses and a vague sense of where the phrase is going. The more pretentious the cover, the harsher the criticism, i suppose."
4,Heaven and Hell to Play With: The Filming of 'Night of the Hunter',"This is no doubt the most complete and insightful examination of a most unusual and spell-binding film. It records the remembrances of most of those actors who appeared before camera as well as the technicians and others behind the camera during the filming of ""Night of the Hunter"" and the involvement of its author, Davis Grubb, as well as the script writer, James Agee, and the director, Charles Laughton. It's clear analysis of the making of the film and the choices made during creation are interesting, although this is not an easy or can't put it down read. The book was just what I was looking for. It's a commentary that should accompany the film."
4,Probably more than you want to know,"A book only for those people who have seen, and loved, ""Night of the Hunter."" Offers incredible, detailed insights not only into the making of the film, but also, into the creative process of Charles Laughton (what an incredible shame that this was the only film he directed). What would make the book better? Better editing (a fifth of the book's text could easily be cut) and more critiques from the time of the movie's release, to get into the mindset of that period (because it's mind-boggling that this was a flop when it came out)."
2,Gosh,"This book had so many typos it wasn't even funny. It seems that the author made some internal English grammar errors. For instance, she used words incorrectly like ""knew"" and ""new"", ""since"" and ""sense"". She needed a editor badly. Also, you could have expand on the characters feelings more. This would have been a decent book if not for all those errors."
3,a different kinda luv,"mediocre reading. some mistakes. interesting, i liked reading about black women; business women that worked hard and played hard. a little too perfect. typical club owner but not so typical 'pimp your ride' car shop. no real elaboration on this ""different kinda luv"" aspect. not only that, there was no developement of a'lana,there was no real developement of the real love relationships the two studs aquired. empty. but there were gay black female characters. i read it.. i read, ...'underdeveloped book, my final answer."
1,Boring CD!!!!!,"Some of the arias were quite good.though overall, it is very dull opera.and Batoli didn't help this opera either.Her mezzo voice is not suitable at all with this high demanding coloratura role as heroine. Terrible miscast to cash in her name even though she doesn't have right soprano voice.For some arias, I found a joy from Sumi Jo's version for same aria by Philips recording.However, once again, it is dull opera overall to enjoy from CD only. I guess you have to see from Stage."
5,Robert MacNeil Reports: Autism Now,"I have a 5-year-old grandson with autism. Even though I have read many articles on the subject, I never really understood all the implications of the condition, how it manifests, how to respond to the child or the future outlook for him. This TV program opened my eyes to all that is involved and how the family can render loving care and understanding in a far better way. It opened me up to talk about this event in our family with others and have been so surprised to learn of others, like myself, who had never opened up and spoken of this family problem with others......even to some whom they knew well. I made this purchase to view from time to time to keep me on track and to loan to others. Thanks for making the available at a fair price with the free shipping. If you as a customer of Amazon are reading this review, PLEASE take this to heart and buy the DVD....it is worth far more than the price!!!!"
5,Floral Art of Redouté the alchimist of Botany,"The Flower Art of Redouté by Mrs Michel is a masterpiece in account of her expertise in XVIIIth century France. She and her father owned gallery Cailleux in Paris which was a reference for collectors of Hubert Robert, Fragonard, Boucher and their expertise was difficult to beat... Her sensitivity blends so well with Redouté Floral Art world and she give as an impressionist painter the essence of his art and his soul... This book is well illustrated and documented and should be an addition in any library of collectors or flower art lovers who liked to deepen his knowledge regarding the Raphael of Flowers...Comte Alexandre de BothuriArt historian and expertCollector"
1,not what i wanted,"Picture shows 1 set of the 5 boxes of the 4 seasons of Transformers, but instead I got 1 chinese box of the 4 seasons Transformers. It's in english with chinese subtitles. Amazon should remove the picture of the 1 set of the 5 boxes of the 4 seasons of Transfomers."
5,Dust-B-Gone,"WOW! I put this on my planer, which usually produces knee deep piles of chips, now there isn't a single chip anywhere. Wish I'd done this years ago."
5,Dust collection adapter,"Item shipped quickly and arrived undamaged. Fit perfectly and does the job effectively. Connected to my dust collector with the 4"" outlet and very little dust/chips escape."
4,Review of Delta 50-359,Product fits well and performs well. 2 more screws should be added to the bottom of this item to prevent it from inadvertently lifting away from the planer.
4,So-so Delta dust collector,"Pros: 1. Great concept. 2. Compact.Cons: 1. Difficult installation--screw location poor, thanks to Delta. Dust port centered above planer outfeed. ..tough for any dust collection system other than overhead."
5,"Finally, no piles of chips!","when I bought my Delta 22-540 planer several years ago, there was no way of catching the piles of chips and dust as they were made. A couple of years later there still was no dust collection accessory available so I quit looking. I happened to do a web search a few weeks back just on a whim and there it was.I couldn't be happier with this product. It does the job well. It seals where it needs to, a large funnel shape helps chips flow to dust collection port, and installation took all of two seconds. Spin off the wing nuts, lift off old chip deflector, slip on the dust collector, spin on the two wing nuts.Done."
5,Delta Tp305,This worked great on a Delta Tp305 12-1/2 Planer using a Jet dust collector. Only had a few chips left over.
5,chrisrefill.com,"Made out of plastic and fits very well to planer. I would choose this one over the metal one with different part numbers any day. I also bought a adapter for a 1.5 shop vac and this does not fit to the 5"" outlet because both parts are 5"" so I duct tape the adapter on the 5"" outlet on the planer connect."
3,Works well- if you can make it work at all,"This item has a rather poor design. The vac port is a huge 4"" - and good luck finding an adaptor to connect that to your shop vac. I hunted all through both Lowes and Home Depot, and the best I could find required duct tape to hold it all together. Once you have that figured out, you still have to figure out what to do with your shop vac hose, as it is attached dead center over where the planed boards are coming out of the planer. That said, once you have managed to jury-rig some sort of system, this does do a very impressive job of collecting the chips. Just make sure your shop vac doesn't fill up!"
4,"Very good, despite the age of the lead singers","It would have been better if this opera was recorded by Pavarotti and Sutherland in the 70's, when they were in their prime (and perhaps could have had Milnes, instead of Nucci, as their Don Carlo). But it's still great to finally hear Ernani with the lighter voices which the opera calls for, rather than the Aida types who too often mangle it (although Price is excellent on RCA). And Pavarotti and Sutherland in decline are still better than most singers in their prime."
2,Swan song for a prima donna,"I agree with the other critic about this Ernani. Dame Joan Sutherland is without question the voice of the century. The Prima Donna Assoluta. And she is discredited with this recording. Go and purchase her Art of the Prima Donna and be dumbfounded instead of disappointed by wide vibrato and belting as you will hear here. Pavorotti is only decent here, to hear him in the prime, order the ""Daughter of the regiment"". ( Bonus: a prime Sutherland in that recording as well ). Hearing the two divine singers in their prime is to hear two of the greatest singers in the history of bel canto. Sigh...the age of bel canto died with the retirement of the great diva, Dame Joan Sutherland."
1,A sad recording,"This is truely very sad that Decca chose to release this Ernani which features the decline of two of the greatest singers of our time, Dame Joan Sutherland and Luciano Pavorotti. Dame Joan Sutherland, the vocal wonder of our time, the greatest coloratura in history, was near retirement at the time of this recording. She should have retired as the greatest Prima Donna of the twentieth century, but to attempt this dramatic role at the age of 62 was just disastrous. Please refer to Dame Joan's earlier Lucia's, Semiramides, and Puritanis as the true samples of her miraculous voice. Pavorotti fares a little better, but to have heard him in Turandot makes this a disappointment. Yes, the conducting is very good indeed, but we need two different singers for the leading roles."
2,An Ernani to avoid,"I had high hopes for this Ernani. This work never gets the attention it deserves, but this recording falls flat. Pavarotti was past his prime in this 1998 effort. Pavarotti fans wishing to hear him nail this part should turn to the Met DVD avaiable on this webcite. Nucci lacks the elegance of a Warren or a Milnes (he too is on the DVD). Joan Sutherland is one of the greatest sopranos ever, but this recording was ill advised. Her sound is a shadow of its former self. I relished the opportunity to hear her Ernani Involami and instead literally crindged. Your money would be better spent on the Opera d'Ora release with Mario DelMonaco and Ettore Bastianini or the DVD mentioned above."
2,What a pity!,"A wonderful Pavarotti as Ernani, a superb Nucci, an horrid Burchulaadze as Silva and ....Dame Sutherland... at the moment of this recording she was 61 and the voice is always trembling and the beauty voice of the Primadonna is vanished... with another soprano and basso would have been a better opera!!! a missed oppurtunity!Massimo Canini"
2,Sutherland well below her prime,"While I am a huge Sutherland fan, i must say I am very disappointed with this recording. Her name draws up images of a huge, soft, brilliant voice, which are not evidenced in this recording because of her age. I have a brilliant recording of her singing ""Ernani, Ernani, Involami!"" which I assumed was from this recording, but unfortunately was not. It's hard to imagine giving her two stars, but this recording was very lacking."
1,THIS 'ERNANI' SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN RELEASED,"There's no sense in going into any great detail here. Sutherland and Pavarotti were two of the greatest operatic giants of this century. Their recordings of ""Daughter of the Regiment"", ""Maria Stuarda"", ""I Puritani"", ""Traviata"", ""Sonnambula"", ""Beatrice di Tenda"", and ""L'Elisir d'Amore"" are object lessons in the art of bel canto. But to have attempted an opera as difficult and ""vocal"" as ""Ernani"" at this point in their respective careers was sheer folly. The mere fact that it was recorded in 1988 and waited ten years to be released should tell something about the risks taken to do this recording. Well, the risks didn't pay off."
4,Good but not great,"A good but not great picture book titled TITANIC, but actually based on drawings, cutaways and photos of the Titanic and her sister ships, the Britannic and the Olympic. A fairly short work and probably of interest to the TITANIC buff, but in my opinion the books illustrated by Ken Marschall are much more evocative and gripping, and of course longer."
4,Happy Customer,A cd I hadn't expected to see. Happy to find it - received quickly in the advertised condition.
4,Memorable and defining moments,"This book is not a biography per se rather a collection of the most pivotal moments in Jimmy Carter's life containing little ""work"" and much ""play"". In this collection of short stories we see Jimmy Carter the son, father, grandfather, climber, painter, and outdoorsman. The conspicuous lack of politics, apart from a brief couple of pages, establishes just how human Jimmy Carter really is. His greatest joys are his children and charitable works not the galas he has attended or the dignitaries he has met, making this a refreshing memoir."
5,Good Value,"This purchase was to replace a 20-year-old CD player in my office. I'm not an audiophile--just looking for competent performance and the ability to play tunes for hours without intervention on my part. The price was right, the set-up was easy, and performance meets my requirements."
1,Not worth the effort,"I tried cooking about 7-8 different dishes from this cookbook and only one came out tasting very good (the eggplant khoresh, which was wonderful). Everything else was very oily and not very flavorful, and not nearly worth the prep time (most of the recipes are more than an hour just for prep, plus two hours to cook (and the cooking is never just ""put it in and set the timer"" - it's ""put it in, come back in 15 minutes and combine it with something from pot B and put it on the stove for 25 minutes, and then ...."")) Also most recipes have around 15 ingredients, many hard-to-find, expensive, and not useful in other recipes, so remaining quantity just goes to waste. If you like food that's relatively bland and very oily, and are willing to work for hours to make a meal, this might be a good book to choose. But if you're like me and just looking for some quick meals to whip up with easy-to-find ingredients, this certainly isn't the cookbook to buy."
5,Question about this book,"This is not a review but a question. How is this book different from New Food of Life by the same author? I have New Food of Life, and enjoy it, and am wondering if I also should buy this book."
2,Dis- APPOINTED,"Only 1-2 recipes worth trying. I had hoped that some of the unusual dips and spreads available at our local Persian restaurants would be here, but they're not. I found better sources free online."
3,recipes are a bit vague about technique,"If you're a fan of America's Test Kitchen, this book may be somewhat frustrating in its lack of detailed descriptions of technique. There are also several pictures of dishes in the book that seem not to be included among the book's recipes. Beautiful photos, nice little essays, some good recipes."
5,Easy Persian Cuisine,"Easy to follow, and with awesome recipes. Had it for a while now, and just gifted one to one of my friends, I surely recommend :)"
1,"One really, really awful book","A reference guide to Great Britain's architecture that fails to include Durham Cathedral?? Unbelievable. Not only was it once voted ""World's Best Building"" by an international panel of architectural historians it is, by common consent, the supreme example in Britain of Romanesque architecture, quite apart from exhibiting the very first stirrings of the Gothic in the vaulting of the choir.This omission alone (and I'm not even going to bother listing all the other glaring gaps) indicates that this excuse for a book can in no way be taken seriously as a reference guide. Do yourselves a favour and don't buy it."
5,Outstanding!,"After I had already ordered different Haggadah's for Seder, I found this one. It is outstanding in my opinion! Very well done, with both English and Hebrew texts, opens left to right like traditional Hebrew writing, easy to read, follow and understand. This is the Haggadah I will be using from now on!"
1,Not Suitable for 1st-Time Listeners. Choose Another!,"Herr M. Goerne has an interesting voice that no doubt is well-suited for any number of musical genres. Unfortunately, Lieder-singing does not appear to be one of them. The tears after hearing Goerne's ""Im wunderschönen Monat Mai"" were not of joy. And Ashkenazy's keyboard interpretation of Schumann might best be described as ""liberal"".I would recommend choosing G. Souzay (if you can find it in print, Philips label), F. Wunderlich or even *early* D. Fischer-Dieskau to hear Lieder in the clear, unmuddy voice called for."
2,The worst Bariton-voice with this recording.,"I must really say, that I do not understand the career of this singer. Ruther listen to Italian Baritones or for example Gerard Souzay: freely flouting voice and wonderful range of colors."
4,Early China's soul in translation,"Are you looking for a readable, yet mature appoach to some of the greatest writings of China? This book does it for you. With the Chinese script on the facing page you can work out the translations on a sentence-by sentence pace, stick to the Chinese only, or read the English only. I recommend that, depending on your level, you at least try to do all three. Don't forget the footnotes! They are worth the extra time and effort. This is a good book to simply enjoy or a well done book for the serious researcher.This book is part of the first generation of thorough research works on the Mawangdui Silks that goes beyond the eearlier archaeological scans and probes the depths of what is presently known about HuangLao DaoismYin-Yang thought, and the canons."
2,Poor Publication,The potential informative content of this book is destroyed by the poor execution of the printed publication. This book which you would expect to be very visually oriented has the majority of its photos so blurred and grainy that they are almost useless. It looks like it was published in someone's basement on an old copy machine. Don't waste your money buying this book.
1,Overpriced and Boring,"I collect books on Halloween - photography, encyclopedias, histories, etc., and so when I saw this halloween encyclopedia I was anxious to purchase it. The price was a bit staggering, especially considering how slender the book is (a mere 255 pages - including the index), but I thought there might be new insight, interesting articles, and color photographs. No, to all of those. The book is a paperback printed on rather cheap paper and the articles are boring. All illustrations are in black and white. I am extremely disappointed, both in the book and in myself. I should have paid more attention to the specifics - paperback, number of pages, but what I fail to understand is the extremely inflated price. This book should be no more than $19.95, and it's being sold for a whopping $72! Not worth it by any means. Unless you can find it at a reasonable price, save your money!"
4,Enjoyable,"I'm not much of a Hallowe'en fan as it is celebrated today, but I enjoyed this book because it primarily talked about the more interesting celebrations at the turn of the century. I wish, however, that some or all of the wonderful vintage Halloween postcards had been in color."
4,Great Find,"I picked this album up simply for the Page Hamilton work but was absolutely amazed at the rest of it.""I'm So Happy You Failed"" is just deliciously satisfying.If you're reading this review and do not own this album, it is worth the money to hunt it down."
5,Fabulous!,"This is one of those books that will really make you laugh. i have not read a book that has romance, humor and passion like this one! I fell in love with all the characters! This is a book that i can read over and over again."
3,"A fair, fun game for kids","This is a game I played growing up and I liked it a lot, I mean, what kid DOESN'T want to ride an electronic dinosaur!? Fairly fun, and a good gift for the kids."
5,Big Wreck goes experimental and ends up with same result,"This album and their first are both classics. That's the only thing I can compare between the two. In their sophomore release (and probably their last), Big Wreck improved on their songwriting and produced 16 very memorable songs. Like their debut, almost every song on this album could be a radio hit. This is not an easy feat and Big Wreck has done it twice! Too bad we won't see it happen to Big Wreck again."
1,anything for more money,"This is one of the worst dvds that i have ever bought. I cannot believe tHat for the money paid that this was a sham. listening to micheal cole makes me sick. he is the worst commentators I have ever heard, and cannot believe that WWE puts up with his kiss ass comments and actions. Please get rid of him. I no longer enjoy watching Smackdown and Raw. For the money spent, it is like stealing from the fans. Also I thought I wAS purchasing the whole event, only to be totally disgusted with the comments and etc, also only a few events, I hope that the people spending their money for the real thing were not as disappointed as I was."
4,Umm Rock was there!!,"I had the opportunity to be in attendance for Wrestlemania. The pop for the Rock was phenomenal! The blu-ray doesn't do it justice. Still an overall good event and the commentary does justice to some otherwise stale (Cole V King) matches. I'd watch this specifically for the Undertaker vs HHH match and the Orton CM Punk. Both were good ""wrestling"" matches.If you're a fan of ""old school attitude."" Rock, Austin, HHH, Undertaker...Buy it!"
2,the worst,ok this wm was a joke and i was sooo pissed off whn i sent the org themes for hhh and takers entrances was edited like i took the damn cd out wtf wwe y would u edit out the org theme music for that night yet the chairshot 2 the head of taker wasnt edited out guess the themes were not pg but the chair shot which is suppose 2 be banned that was alright wow wwe is just full of shtt more times than not dont buuy this dvd the show regardless ...
3,Couldve been better!!!,"The reason the Rock hosted wrestlemania because the lineup wasnt a wrestlemania lineup. Normally Wrestlemania would have epic matches or never before seen matches. The only match that was of that calibur was HHH vs. The Undertaker. Hopefully next year's Wrestlemania will be better with the Rock vs. John Cena as the main event already. Other than that I will still get this blu-ray just to see the rock and cena's altercation on the Raw before Wrestlemania, if its on the blu ray. Other than that I like to see HBK's full induction to the Hall of Fame!!!"
2,Lackluster Wrestlemania,"This had to be one of the worst Wrestlemanias I've seen in years. The only matches worth seeing are Randy Orton vs. CM Punk, Undertaker vs. HHH and maybe Edge vs. Del Rio.Snookie gets screen time and Daniel Brian doesn't? Really? Drew Carey is inducted into the Hall of Fame? Really? They might as well induct David Arquette while they're it.I'm a huge Rock fan but I don't think he really brought anything stellar into this PPV.Many of the segments such as the one with Snoop Dogg were just plain cheesy and atrocious. I can't believe I spent over 60 dollars on this travesty."

2,The reasons why I am not getting this.,"1. The Entrane Music from Triple H is NOT on the DVD. Pay for it Vince lol.2. Also Cash's ""Aint no grave"".. not on.3. The whole Show was low. Worth watching? Taker vs HHH. The WHC Match was a joke. The Main Event was awful. The best moment was when Steve Austin and Rock crossed.. WOW!Wel.. another good point is the Hall of Fame. My personal favourite of all time, Mr Michaels got inducted. Great Speech! Also liked the whole HoF.1 Point for the great performance of Taker & HHH and of course : Shawn Michaels."
3,3 reasons why i am getting the dvd,3 reasons1.HBK Hall of fame induction ( the best ever)2.HHH vs Taker ( amazing match)3. Edges Last Matchother than that i agree with the guy that said this was like a long episode of raw
4,It was actually alright,"This wrestlemania to me was alright. What made it cool was that The rock, Stone Cold, Jerry Lawler, Jim Ross, and Booker T were back, and undertaker was fighting HHH for the second time at wrestlemania."
3,It Works At Least,"Like several previous reviews have indicated, WWE was apparently unable to secure the rights to Triple H's and Undertaker's entrance songs, which were both incredible. What replaced these tunes completely ruined the mood. This is an average and functioning Bluray disc. We've had worse."
4,The streak lives!!!,First off i would like to start off by saying that I am a huge John Cena fan and don't like what happened to him in the main event but everyone knew it was coming. I mean you don't expect The Rock to get an Attitude Adjustment and just take it lying down. This was a pretty good wrestlemania especially the Undertaker vs Triple H and Edge vs Alberto Del Rio matches. I can't say enough about the Undertaker vs Triple H match. It's definantly the show stealer and one of the best matches i've ever seen in my life. I mean these two beat the hell out of each other. It just gives you even more respect for the dead man and the game. If you are in question of whether to buy this or not definantly buy it just for the undertaker vs triple h match. Trust me you will be far from disappointed.
5,Great new age!,"This is a departure from Hardiman's Lord of the Dance music, but it is worth the trip! I bought this without hearing any of it because of the Lord of the Dance connection. Although it is a different style, I consider it one of my favorites. I would recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys great new age."
1,1 of the bars doesn't work,I ordered these tension bars because they are the perfect size to fit between the beams in my pantry. 2 of the 3 work perfectly and am currently using them to hang my cleaning supplies -very happy with those 2. Unfortunately the 3rd bar in the package is defective; it clicks and loses tension when I try to install it.
4,Miss Mary Martha Crawwford,The story is so relevant to the time setting. It was always moving forward. Readers who read a lot in the 1800 period would recognize the traits.I enjoyed the read.
3,"Looks nice, glass a bit thin","I bought this as a candy dish for the office. It looks nice. My only concern is that the glass seems a bit thin and the edges aren't super finely finished. Good for a inexpensive candy bowl, however."
5,A Golden Oldie,"I found this book in a laundromat reading area while travelling across the country on the back of a motorcycle in the early 1970's...hippie days. I thought it would be really hippie dippie bull, which I guess in some ways it was ...but there was so much in it that touched my 21 year old confused and hurting heart I found that I read it and reread many parts of it. My favorite line at that time was something like ""you disturb the peace of the universe as much by taking offense as giving offense."" Not new stuff now but to a 21 year old rural Ohio girl on the road it was life changing...Bought copies a few years ago for my kids and they seem a lot longer and wordier than the original small book I remember - don't know if that is true or if my memory just remembered the good parts. Kind of dated now I think with all the Pema Chodron and many others teaching lots of positive stuff...but this was an original in its time and opened new ways of thinking for me."
5,Handbook for higher conciousness,"Helps me take the high road in my thinking. Demonstrates the diffrient levels of thought processes that helps me think more maturely and removes the addictive demands I place on myself that produces all the unhappiness in my life.In several other difficult times in my life I have read this book and it helped show me the way out of the pain I was in. I am going through one of those times now so I ordered it to review and get back on the path to Happiness. IT IS ALREADY HELPING .Emma,NC"
5,for all to read,"Wow very powerful, great book. once you start you will not be able to put it down. Read it every day you will enjoy."
5,Medical help,"I bought this book after searching for books on thinking more positively, but it has turned out to be alot more than just that. As a firefighter/paramedic my crew has had a bad run of pediatric runs the past 6 mths that all ended bad. This book has helped put alot of those thoughts into perspective a little more. This book gives you a new way of looking at life, not just more positively but completely different. Being I bought the book used it is also pretty cool seeing some of the stuff the reader before me outlined, and little notes they left showing some insight as to what parts of the book were helping and reaching them."
5,This book is timeless and one to give to all your loved ones,"If you are the type of person who wants to fulfill your life's purpose..then this book will aide in your journey. I have read the book many times, and each time I gain new insight through my own passages of time. Share it..it is a gift of love."
1,"Disappointing, Poor Value","Cheap, cheesy, and very little actually written by Commander X. A rip-off. There's better stuff out there by this author and others on this subject. Pretty much anything else you get will be better. In fact, spend nothing but your time on the David Icke website and you'll get a lot more."
2,It's okay to be paranoid but not gullible.,"When I read the reviews for this book prior to buying it and found that most of them were less than complimentary, I took that with a grain of salt. Part of me even thought that some of the reviews may have been ""planted"" to discourage the public from purchasing this book. I had never read anything by Commander X before so I was curious, but even after reading the book I hadn't read anything by X. The entire book is hodgepodge of different authors and random articles pulled off the internet. It does, however, offer some interesting theories and musings which are entertaining, but few are backed by any extensive evidence. I'm not going to tell you not to buy this book because I did, and you may want to read it for yourself to decide where you stand. If you're like me you'll find the part written by Branton particularly incoherent and I'll leave you with the two words in his section that made me put this book down, ""communist homosexuals""."
1,All of his books are rip-offs,"I mean come on. Over $20 for only 100 pages? This ""Commander X"" character is trying to win the lottery by putting out skimpy books that could easily be condensed into one volume. But that's not all - all of this information (and much more, in fact) can easily be found for free on the Internet. Commander X = RIPOFF."
1,REALITY OF THE SERPENT RACE AND OTHER BOOKS,COMMANDER X CLAIMS TO HAVE BEEN HIGH UP IN THE SECRET GOVERNMENT. HE SIMILARLY CLAIMS TO HAVE BEEN IN CHARGE OF MAJOR SECRET PROJECTS ETC ETC ETC.THE GUY CANT EVEN STRUCTURE A SENTENCE THE BOOK IS POORLY WRITTEN AND IS FULL OF GRAMMATIC ERRORS AND SENSATIONALISM. A GOVERNMENT WHO EMPLOYS SUCH A GUY (MR x) (PROBABLY CANT SPELL HIS NAME)TO PREPEARE REPORT FOR THEM WE HAVE NO NEED TO FEAR.THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE PROVIDED BY HIM.IT MAKES A GOOD YARN HOWEVER FOR PRE-SCHOOLERS.PS EXCUSE THE ERRORS MRX TRAINED.
1,more psuedo conspiracy junk,"Lmao! Ya'll ppl got too much time on yur hands to write lies! I mean, the critism to this book is poor babble at best. For the record, Ive flown through space with mickey mouse and we both eat quasars like they are ice cream and what we can't eat we put in the trunk of the jet mobile. lmao! get real ppl, sure, we are not alone in the universe, but have u ever stopped to wonder how these would be enemies of the government can get so close to their suppose to be hidden secrets? Indeed this is just more garbage to sell to ppl for profit, this type of propoganda is the true tabloid cream of the crop. Lmao!"
1,C'est la vie,I received my order promptly and perfectly packaged with the key in a plastic bag with the correct number marked on on bag. The problem is that the key does not work and I emailed the seller to ask what to do about this and never heard back. Thank goodness it was not an expensive item.
2,Just ok.,"Bought these for my maternity stay in the hospital when I had my daughter - wasn't all that impressed with qlty & sizing ran pretty small. They held their purpose for the short time I used them, but wouldn't note them as truly comfortable for long term use. Defntly in flight slippers only. I've packed them away in the handy travel case they came with for my next flight...in the event I decide to be bold enough & change into them!"
5,Overall view in World History,"I found this book to give me exactly what I needed, a general overview of World History. It was very easy reading and it kept me glued to the pages. I wanted to read more and more. I do, however, agree if you want more in depth material you will need to go to another history book."
4,nice little looms but......,"These will only work with ignition wires that are not pre assembled. Rubber grommets must be installed on looms then wires threaded through the grommets. In other words, the looms have to be installed before the wires ends/boots are assembled."
2,very many formulas,"Actually I was hoping to get a practical guide to determine how to choose a regenerator for a practically workable Stirling engine.I was a little bit disappointed to see that this book is full with an incredible amount of complicated formulas. As a practical man (and not a very skilled mathematician) this book was not very useful to me.So my conclusion is: If you are not afraid of big formulas and like to REALLY know everything about regenerator theory, this might be your book.If you want to make a Stirling engine for yourself and want to check which regenerator you need for that purpose: I hope you'll find a more suitable book."
4,Great read....but many flaws,"I enjoyed this book from cover to cover...it really did hold my attention. However, there were many flaws, mostly in the flow of time. For example...if a person is stated to be 35 years old in a certain year...well he is NOT, then, 59 years old just 14 years later. Stuff like that drives me nuts. The other flaw in this book....and this may or may not be considered a flaw...is that most of the characters are really unlikable...even the likable ones have serious character defects."
3,150 pages too long,"While engaging in the sections covering early history (ignoring the formulaic obligatory sex), the final phases of this book, from the 1960's on, are painfully badly written fiction. The authors have an axe to grind regarding the Vancouver Stock Exchange, and populate these chapters with stock (no pun intended) characters whose exploits are tedious. Inaccuracies are jarring to a person who knows Vancouver well (the Landmark Hotel is on Robson Street, not Denman, for example), and pointless exposition does nothing to move the plot.Many reviews equate this novel with the works of James Michener; ""Vancouver"" is in the Michener style but without his meticulous research and memorable characterizations."
2,Disappointing,"Ron Sexsmith sounds like a mix of Kermit the frog, and a man struggling with a speech impediment. With some catchy tunes scattered through this CD, it's very hard to even scratch the surface upon first listening. Cobblestone Runway would be a better first listen, if you insist on doing so."
5,Melody at its best,"It's hard to descibe an album like this, or Ron Sexsmith's music generally, without sounding gushy and over the top. I'm sure if you listen to it though, you'll quickly understand what I mean. If your not already with Ron's music, you might also want to check out his first, self titled record, which since its release around 5 years ago, has already become a classic, and is simply one of best bodies of music going. His other two are almost just as good. Paul McCartney, Elvis Costello, Elton John, Paul Simon, Cheryl Crowe and Sarah McClaughlin are some of Rons biggest fans, and it's easy to understand why. Do your heart and mind a favour, break open your piggy bank, and join the club."
1,dont waste money or time,this is the worst case ever. the belt clip was manufactured wrong and doesnt even clip onto the case. And you cant open the phone with the case on becuase it presses the touch sensative buttons and calls people atomatically or ends a call while your talking. Besides the fact that in order to slide the phone up you have to put effort into cuase the rubber sticks together. i had the case for 4 days and already its starting to tear apart. dont bother with it its ugly and worthless.
1,Breathing Device is a rip off,"My 8 year old son used his allowance to buy this toy. Imagine his disappointment when he got the device and it didn't sound at all like Darth Vader breathing. It sounds like bad static. My son is helping me write this and in his words, ""This is a rip off!"" I wish I had read the other review before purchasing."
2,The sound is off,"I was pleased to receive my package quickly from the seller, and upon removing the ""try me"" tab from the back, gave the unit a try. The breathing sound was incredibly low, not at all like Darth Vader in the movies. I thought this was due to the old test batteries they had in there, so I took those out and added 2 new AAA batteries. The unit sounds exactly the same. It might be defective, but the low price makes me hesitate whether going through the hassle of trying to exchange this thing would be worth it. Guess I'll just stick with super duper deep breath vader."
2,Don't waste your money!,Broke almost immediately after we received it. My grandson couldn't use it with his Halloween costume & was very disappointed.
5,Surprising,"This article is funny, novelty and different to other device for children and to use costume.. Is easy to use."
4,Co. Trail,The book overall was helpful when hiking for the first time in some areas but some descriptions were contradictory
5,Outstanding - Highly recommended,"Get this book. You won't find a better Guidebook. I have numerous Guidebooks from several publishers and authors and I haven't seen anything better. The book includes sections on planning your trip, the heritage, natural history and geology of the Colorado Trail.The book provides a tremendous amount of information. A great deal of effort went into the organization and layout of the information in the book. The individuals that were responsible for making this book available should take tremendous pride in a job very well done.Note that this book is bigger and heavier than many other Guidebooks because of the great color photographs. I consider this to be a plus. This is a beautiful Guidebook. My other Guidebooks for the most part all have black & white photographs. They all pale in comparison to this beautiful book."
4,Nice but missing a few things,"I agree with all of the positive points of the first review.The only things that are missing, which I think are important, is that on the book's maps none of the coordinates are given for the trail. Waypoints would be excellent information so that you can map it on your own Topo! software without having to buy something else in addition to the book."
4,Excellent product - well made - will hold 6 ties,"I needed additional tie cases as I travel extensively. The price of this leather tie case sure beats what you can get from Brooks Brothers or Coach etc. The product is well made and can hold 3 ties in each half = 6 ties in all. I'm sure you can stuff an additional tie in there if that is what you want. The interior is cloth lined and the ties are secured with 2 elastic bands in each half of the case, secured at one end with snaps. Only gripe (and I am being picky) is that it is a bit narrower than my Coach tie case, so if really broad ties (anything larger than about 4"" wide)come back in fashion you might be out of luck. Zippers work well and for the price it is a bargain."
2,Not a very convincing opinion,"This book is slow going and hard to read. I was hoping it would be a quick read and full of thoughts I could use to convince others of the benefits of raw food. It does not do that. I agree with another reviewer who said this was an outdated walk down memory lane. There are so many benefits to raw food. Can't someone organize them scientifically and convincingly? This book goes off on many tangents and is completely and utterly unconvincing. It is not a good book for new raw foodists, experienced raw foodists, or those considering raw foodism. I am still searching for the perfect book for beginners. So far, the raw food Detox diet is my favorite for newbies and the raw food diet myth is the best all inclusive review."
2,Bait & Switch,"As a raw foodist, I hoped this book would help me sort out fact from fiction about cooked vs. raw, providing me with ammo for the many food critics I encounter. But Joe Alexander, in an extremely clumsy writing style, not only made the book a challenge to finish but often diverted from the subject at hand. I'm sure Tibetan rejuvenation exercise rites are valuable as are rebirthing breathing techniques, but that's not what the book title suggests."
5,inspirational....,especially for a faw fooder in a cooked world :) as well as those who are interested in adding more raw food to their diet.
2,"If you like anecdotes, you'll love this book","If not, there's not much useful here. A lot of easy reading trips down the 1970's memory lane."
2,Nothing special,"The ball without the rope is MUCH sturdier. Our Goldens destroyed this one within minutes, but the larger ball that has no rope is none the worse for wear after weeks of constant use."
4,Simplicity at its best.,"This film is very much what its title suggests - the making of Fanny and Alexander. A camera is registrating the people and the work around Bergmans master-piece Fanny and Alexander. It is nothing more and nothing less. It is a silent testimony in which youre not served anything, as a consequence there is, on the other hand, a lot to discover."
5,good buy,"Just got mine in the mail a few minutes ago. Its a little smaller than i expected, but maybe thats just me. The symbol itself, excluding the ring for the little string, is about 1 inch from top to bottom. The overall length from top to bottom is about 1.5 inches. The ONLY thing that i didnt like about it, and this is a minor thing, is that you cant take off the included lanyard without cutting it off, which is no problem, but it would just be nice to be able to keep it intact. As advertised, the lanyard is fully adjustable, and looks sturdy enough. The symbol itself has kind of a....light heaviness to it. I know that makes no sense, but youll see what i mean when you buy it.Overall, i think this is a great product and at only ten bucks, its a good deal too, so go ahead and buy it."
2,Decent young adult thriller,"Once again, Christopher Pike brings us into a world in which a roomful of attractive high schoolers have to figure out who among them is the murderer.At over 200 pages, this is a thicker book than most of what Pike writes, and that's probably because he's building a cast of characters to take us through a trilogy. As a stand-alone novel, though, the extra length isn't justified in supporting the formulaic plot.Not to say that this is a bad book; Pike does a good job of adapting the modern thriller and romance genres to a young teen audience in the same way that a slate of WB tv shows have mastered that sleek package.If you like Pike, you'll probably find this trilogy as good as his other novels. If you don't, this one won't change your mind any. If you're about to give this author your attention for the first time, I would recommend Chain Letter, which is a much better example of how good he can be."
5,THIS BOOK WAS SO REAL!,"I have read lots of books that TRY to protray life, but some how it doesn't work. This book did though. The author made some real characters instead of phony ones and mixed them into a situation of whodunit. I thought this book was so excellent and I recommend it to anyone who is wanting a good (REAL GOOD) read. I thought all of the characters were made out to be real people and I appriciate the author for finally protraying life as a teenager. Need I say more?"
2,Nice Try,"This book's main plot was okay. It is a murder story, and in that aspect, was done pretty well. On the other hand, it had a bunch of superficial characters that weren't developed at all. There was alot of cheesy romance going on in the backround. None of the character relationships were believable or anything like reality. Read this only if you can find nothing else."
2,too bulky for running,This vest was too bulky for me and my running needs. I think it would be especially too much in the hot summer months. The vest is larger than my sleeveless running tanks. I returned this item and found a running vest that is basically like suspender straps that criss-cross the body and is very light weight!
3,"It will work for the price, but not great for running","It definately ensures I am seen during a late evening run, but it constantly rubs against my arm during the run and can become irritating. Will work for now until I find something else that doesn't break the bank."
2,comes small,"this barely fit my husband over a sweatshirt so will definitely not fit over a winter coat, hes not a big guy either, he weighs about 180"
4,Run safer anytime of day,This vest stays put and let's me run safer near traffic any time of year. I wear it day or night for increased visibility. Never run without reflection!
2,OK,"Nice design, plenty of flexibility for sizing and well made, but in low light situations the reflective material was not as bright as I would liked. We walk the dog along streets without sidewalks and the starlight is not enough to stimulate the reflective material. Car lights up close will work, but by the time they get that close they have to swerve to avoid you. Will be switching to a battery operated device for our use."
2,Who's kidding who?,"Have ordered many , many items from Amazon. Have been satisfied that I generally got what I paid for every time. This Vest has prompted me to right my very fist review. I wanted to use it for walking our dogs at night. I read the reviews diligently, and several people wrote that this vest would fit over coats worn in the winter time. Yet, to my dismay, when I opened the package and did a trial run over my shirt in the house, it was a snug fit. I am 5'11, 180 pounds. My 5'5 wife tried to put it on over her coat(at least oncoming traffic would see one of us). Nope, it's not big enough. So, I ask who is kidding who, because CLEARLY this will not fit over any average sized persons coat! I question the reviews that said they would. Now, if it were summer and I was walking in a t shirt, it would probably work. A winter coat? Forget about it!!!!!"
2,Not the best reflective vest,"This vest is nice because it is highly reflective. But, I bought it for running (even though it is a walking vest) and it's pretty clunky when you run. Also, mine came damaged, and that was a bummer!"
4,Vest,"This vest works great, I am easly seen by others. I really like the zippered pocket to carry my ID with me. Only one flaw. the staps that go around your waist could be longer. I'm 5'8"" and 200 lbs, medium build and it barley fits me. I'm in thet process of lossing weight, so hopefully it won't be a problem for long. :)"
5,wonderful writer,"I love to read anything by Bunn. He never fails to thrill and cause thoughtful curiosity. Thank you for such quick shipping and product quality and also for mindful followup. I should use this source often. G. Study Ft. Worth, TX USA"
4,Enjoyable,Loved the setting and characters... I felt like I was on an adventure with them. I like to read at night and I found myself looking forward to snuggling in bed and seeing what came next.
4,Good Writing.,"This was a good piece of fiction, well done, and very Christian to the end. It's a mystery tangled with a love story, mixed in with mourning of lost love--well thought out and, not preachy. The focus is on the relationships, not the house, though the house brings the relationships into focus."
4,The Book of Hours,"good ""reflective"" reading ... poems are ""nature"" based with a theistic motif. something to be picked up from time to time."
2,Economic hostory posint as general history,"From the title of the book,I expected a general history of Chile, but this is mainly an economic history. If the title had reflected this, I should not have been disappointed, but there is too little about politics, culture, religion, philosophy, art, daily life of the people, racial conflicts, etc. If one desires to know all!!?? there is to know about mining, trade, agriculture and people promoting these activities, the book is good enough; but this was not what I expected from the title of the book."
1,Unavailable,"The diary was not available from the source shown on Amazon. We were very discouraged. No attempt to locateanother copy was offered,"
4,Much Better Than I Anticipated,"I read the review below after I had ordered, but before I had received the Virtual Test Center. Upon reading the review I had resigned myself to the thought that I had wasted my money. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the Test Center was much better than described below. After reading three separate study guides, I thought I had a good grasp on it all. I was wrong. The Test Center really helps you identify your problem areas. It's not until you simulate the exams that you force yourself to learn all the small, detailed things that really make a difference on the exam. Without the Test Center, I'm fairly certain that I would have failed the exam. Using the Test Center, I passed with a much better score than required. The product isn't perfect, but it's well worth the money."
3,Its ok,"To whomsoever its concern,The book is a nice attempt and is useful for scjp aspirants. But still it needs lot of improvements in terms of content etc.For someone like me, who has some experience in java i believe Mock Tests are highly valuable than anything else.....Hope this will help someone making the decision.Regardsrobin"
1,Misleading typos,There are several key errors in the practice and timed tests. One relates to overriding static methods. Another to assigning values to boolean variables.I've found the Sybex Java 2 Virtual Trainer to be error-free and a better value.
2,not worth the money,"Good sturdy bag, However not worth the price once shipping is included- it is smaller than it looks in the photos."
4,big tote bag,"I received the tote very fast. Is water proof. It holds everythings to travel, theater, shopping. It seems to be a durable tote."
4,OK Travel tote,"This is a nice, sturdy bag and good size for travel. Would be nicer if it had a couple of interior compartments. I like that it is lightweight and has a waterproof lining. Decent value."
3,Huge! Strap a little too short,Bag is built of durable washable material and is well made. Twenty inches in height is much bigger than I thought it would be. Strap looks longer in picture than it is. Tote will ride high and I prefer them a little lower. At this size it is more like a travel bag than an every day tote. Nothing wrong with vendor's description. I should have measured the size of the tote I am using before I ordered to make sure I was buying the correct size.
3,It works but it's a pain in my instance.,"Note that this doesn't come with the boards you need to install it. You can see them in the picture. One thing that the product description doesn't include is that it's specifically made for ceilings with flat ceilings. My garage has an arched one, so I had to figure out a way how to install it on my own.Also my canoe would only lift about halfway up. I still don't have it working yet. There isn't enough space on the part that tightens up. So far I've put about 3-4 hours getting all of this installed, and it's still not done yet. It does look like it'll do the job once I finally figure it all out."
4,good customer service,When the Harken Hoister arrived it was missing pulleys and washers. After emailing Harken they shipped the missing parts immediately
2,Bad Game,"This game is horrible. There is no real object to the game. The missions are no fun and they are pointless. THis was supposed to be a snowboarding game, right? It's basically running from the cops while on a snowboard. 2 stars."
2,...eh,"Hi! my name is Dark Summit and I am a mediocre game. I want you to buy me if you already own all the good games for GameCube and have no other choice. Actually, what do you think you're doing? Go play SSX Tricky... I'm not worth [the money]!"
3,Great flag for the money,"These cheaply made flags will fit the bill for your up and coming referee. They are durable enough, but lack some of the features of the pro-ref flag kits. That being said they are also about 450% less expensive, which offsets the quality issue. My son has been using these for the entire season and they have held up fine. I anticipate buying another set for next year, as these have faded a bit."
5,Great Price,"The flags came early than i expected, brand new and works great. The price is great compare to other sellers. I would love to come back if i ever need anything."
2,Rating more in line with press reviews,Shiv Raj Giri is a wacky street wiley dude clothed(or not) as a yogi. At timeshe is on a journey with nothing but a small sack of possesions and others hehas the large three pointed staff... sometimes he shows his newspaper clippingsconcerning his superhuman genetalia... low grade rap hustler dude... but a funfilm to watch as a result of the quacks... rent rather than purchase!
2,Not what I expected,"I did not like this film. I got a t-shirt from my yoga teacher with the picture from the movie cover, so it sparked my interest. I find yoga and its origins interestig, at least I thought.....The film was strange and I really just didn't like it. I had no idea about some of the things that they did and I don't really see the point of standing on on leg until it swells up to an unrecognizable limb, pulling a vehicle with your penis, or surrounding yourself with animal dung. Perhaps that is closed minded, but it's just my opinion. I continue to like the yoga practice for its physical and mental benefits, just did not enjoy this film."
5,the KING of walses,"Andre is a remarkeble musician and showman. I cannot stop viewing his DVD's. He'is absolutely great and a wonderful person. When he started as a professional violonist, no recordcompany even wanted to listen to his music. ""Go to your granny!...."" they said. Now he belongs to the category of James Last, Helmut Zacharias and Wiener Symphoniker, travelling all over the world, playing his popular tunes. Hope he keeps on going for many years to come."
3,Classical music CD,"I love classical music. I was not aware when I purchased this CD of Andre Riew that there would be so much audio from the audiance. It takes away from his playing and to the listening that I want.I still love his music, just would not buy one in concert again. Amazon listed concert, so I should of paid more attention to the fact that it was In Concert."
5,Great Rieu,"As always,this is one of many great Andre Rieu concerts.I have only praise for the music and each one in the orchestra."
3,Always Pleasant,All of Andre Rieu's recordings are pleasant and this is more of the same. I didn't find anything outstanding on it but that doesn't keep me from listening to it.
2,Item did not work properly,"The product was delivered quickly which was impressive however, once opened, it appeared to be cheaply made. After several attempts to make the popcorn, all that came out was a handful. Many calls were made to customer service to see if the problem was on my end. After a few more attempts, we gave up! This item looks nice but is not user friendly."
3,Not perfect,The maker would help alot to design this with a magnetic lid. As is it pops with such force the top stays open & 1/4 of the kernals fly out without popping.
4,Bought for a College Class,"Even though I bought this for one of my courses, it was still a really great read. I love reading about ancient cultures and their myths. It is really interesting the theories they came up with to explain the world around them."
2,"Dry, esoteric, and occasionally nonsensical","I bought this book because I enjoyed each of several (partially reconstructed) translations of Gilgamesh I had read and because I generally enjoy primary sources of myths and legends.This book, unfortunately, is entirely too academic; reading the dry, fragmentary sources becomes an unpleasant chore, especially in ""Gilgamesh.""Dalley probably did as well as she could in translating the difficult originals in as close a form to the original cuneiform tablets as possible, but the result is a book with almost no interest to the general reader or even the armchair Assyriologist.Unless you're a hard-core would-be Joseph Campbell or a stuent planning to go into the field, you'd be advised to pass this book up."
4,Completes the portable sharpening kit,"I bought the Gatco portable sharpening kit. It's fine for outdoor equipment but to sharpen cooking cutlery, you'll want the extra-fine stone as well. The ceramic, pull through, style sharpeners can't hold water to the diamond sharpeners and this extra-fine stone.My only wish is that they guide bar collapsed all the way into the handle the way they do in the portable set. There doesn't really seem to be a need for the much longer guide. I may just cut it and re-shape the end myself."
4,So far ok,"Have not had this stone long. Can't give much feedback other than to say the difference between finishing with this and finishing with the ""Fine"" stone is 30-40% on routine quality kitchen knives."
5,Donkey Kong 2 w.Bongos,My kids and grand kids had a blast with this game. It was really great and the bongos added s something new for them to play with. Glad we got it!
2,How disappointing!,"Me being the music and the classic Donkey Konga fan I am. I was ecstatic to receive this in the mail, then 10 mins later I felt differently, the songs were all covers which wasn't expected (and since the previous game didn't stoop that low) I feel that they shouldn't have made a sequel to such an amazing game, its false advertising. Stick with the first one, unless you like Kidz Bop type music.. and I guess some people do."
5,Step by Step Through the New Testament.,"I used this as a New Testament Survey for about 21 people, mostly over 35. It was very effective and most really enjoyed the experience. The text touches on many subtelties that other surveys do not have. Also it is written in such a way that it does not become a boring text."
1,Not Impressed!,"If you have the teaching book that goes with this book,then I am sure the book would be great but alone I was not impressed!"
1,Not Worth It,The Chocolate would not melt.. I ended up placing the chocolate bowl in a water bath in my regular fondue pot and made do..............
1,not what is advertised,"I bought this based on the photo and description. I have 2 already and couldn't find any more for a long time. My old one is just as it's shown in the photo and described here. The old version has a ceramic (visible in photo) removable pot, 4 dipping forks, 4 ceramic (not plastic) bowls, etc. The new one that just arrived has a thin metal pot, 2 plastic dipping bowls, a plastic lid , 2 forks, one ladel, and 6 molded sets. Not what is advertised or shown in the photo. Check the product weight description - 4 lbs, however shipping weight is only 2 lbs? now I know, that's not a typo. Very dissapointed!!!!"
4,Fondue any day!,"This Fondue kit is pretty cool. It works very well to melt chocolate chips and makes a great starter kit for candy making. The accessories that come with it are a little cheap in quality but they work very well. For any day use it is perfect for chocolate covered strawberries, marshmallows and whatever you can get your hands on. My wife and i make our own goobers (chocolate covered peanuts) and they are great."
5,No LumiBrite feature,There were several descriptions of this watch which indicated it had LumiBrite hands and hour markings. This watch does not have that feature nor any form of luminous markings. It is a very attractive watch and I am happy with the purchase.
5,Great light weight watch.,This watch is light weight and you dont even know it is on. Very easy to read. Good for everyday and going out.
4,Looking for a good dictionary,"I have been looking for a decent but lower in price Swedish-English dictionary that is helpful for engelska speaking people. Most I have seen are for Swedes that want to learn English.This dictionary has English-Svenska Swedish-Engelska as well as codes so that you can figure out whether the dang noun is a neuter or common noun and their declension class i.e. Ett bi, bit, bin etc. Hippocrene was of no use for that.Overall good."
2,A dictionary for Swedish peaple in disguise,"I bought this dictionary in order to learn Swedish.Unfortunately, although the title on the cover is in English and seems not to assume anything about the reader's knowledge in Swedish, the dictionary is clearly targeted at Swedish speakers.The introduction is in Swedish only and there are no pronunciation keys under Swedish entries."
5,Prisma's Swedish /English & English Swedish Dictionary,The dictionary was known to me before ordering and I took a chance on a new but shopworn copy which completely filled the bill.
2,"Trisha, come home!","What happened? Not one good song here. Writing: poor. Production: poor. Singing: decent. Trisha, come back to where you belong! Stop this progression into pop/ adult contemporary. She is losing the twang!"
2,WHY TRISHA WHY?,"If like me you've bought Trisha Yearwood's past albums for the material with a Country connection - give this a good listen before you buy! The 'MOR Pop' alarm bells have gone off before with some of her work, but with this effort Trisha launches herself into pop/rock territory like never before, assisted by Mark Wright's full-on overblown production! It's not that the songs are bad - it's just the treatment they've been given. Many fans and Trisha herself might think that this is a bold experiment, but I think it's just plain boring. Had she stayed with Garth Fundis as Producer (as on her previous album), kept the strings to a minimum, and gone for a more spare sound, the whole thing could have turned out great. As it is, I've sold my copy and gone back to 'Real Live Woman'- now that's a good album."
2,She can sing anything but...,What a disappointment. Her song choice really failed her here. And what's with a totally unnecessary and unoriginal remake of Seven Year Ache. I'm sorry but as much I love Trisha this one was a waste of money!
4,Heavy arrangements with a stellar voice.,"As a professional singer/songwriter, I am always amazed at the vocal quality and control displayed by Trisha Yearwood. Though the musical arrangements on Inside Out tend to lean toward the heavy side, her shining ability still stands clear."
2,Not one of her better ones,"This is not one of her better albums. I think she has a great voice and some of her later songs like ""Georgia Rain"" demonstrate that fact but this album is pretty mundane"
1,I never thought I could give Trisha 1 star!,"I might be in the minority opinion, but this album just wasn't my cup of tea. There are too many slow songs on here which could have been done by just about anybody. The title track with Don Henley was just annoying altogether with no feeling or sense of fun - it sounded like they both just did it to record a duet together and nothing else. ""I Would Have Loved You Anyway"" is an ok ballad, but it doesn't stand out from similar songs done over the past 5-10 years.If you are looking for travelling music or some uplifting tunes, avoid this album at all costs. If you want to complete your Trisha collection, wait until it's on sale."
4,4 because...,"1.) ""Inside-Out"" was originally writen and performed by Bryan Adams on 1998's ""On A Day Like Today"" album.2.) The album otherwise is good.3.) She's easy on the eyes.4.) I recommend this."
2,"I don't mean to be mean, but........","I should first start by telling you all that I love TY's voice! I think that she has one of the best voices in contemporary country today. However, this album is so overproduced and packed with little emotion I was highly dissapointed. If you are looking for a great recent country album, check out the new Mary Chapin Carpenter album, it will be worth every penny. But back to TY, I think the writers sold her short on this one. It is not to say that her voice does not shine, but the material is so mediocre that it is difficult to overlook. If you are buying it for the first single, listen to a few other tracks first and see if you like it. If this is your first TY album you will have bought, I highly suggest the recent Real Live Woman or even better, Songbook-a collection of some of her finest work."
1,Needs a songwriter and new producer,"Big Trisha fan, but this album is in dire need of better songs, and the production is horrible. Some songs sound like there is a 1970 vintage beatbox on it. Some sound like I want to go to sleep. Duet with Rosanne Cash is really good (although you can not hear Rosanne as much as you should - hello production???), and is ""Would have loved you anyway"", but the rest of the album is bleeech! Bring back some good songs! Too many slow poor me ballads. Cheer up! She is extremely gifed vocally, but this is like listening to Eddie Van Halen play the Bunny Hop on his guitar. Wasted effort."
4,Queen of Country Pop,"Trisha Yearwood continues to record great albums of radio-friendly country pop. The choice of material, including songs from Mataca Berg, Rosanne Cash, Hugh Pestwood, and Harlan Howard, is excellent. The title track, a duet with Don Henley of a song written by Bryan Adams and Gretchen Peters, is among the most pop-oriented songs of Yearwood's career. It could well be a crossover hit. Anything released as a single from this album could go to number one. My favorites are ""For a While"", a lighthearted heartache song, and ""I Don't Paint Myself into Corners"", a song of emotional survival. Along with co-producer, Mark Wright, Trisha has produced another excellent, slick, polished album of potential hits."
1,"Bitter Author, bitter experience","Finished reading the book, ""BITTER PERSIMMONS"" by A.S. Friedell. She is not a very good writer. I wondered about the title----she is also a bitter person. She blames everything that happened to her on her parents. NONE of it is her fault.Underneath the title inside the book it says: ""AN UNLIKELY STORY"" and that it is."
5,Truly disturbing....wouldn't let me sleep at night....,This film was absolutely brilliant...the most suspenseful and engrossing movie I have seen in a long time...it lingered in my mind long afterwards and gave me nightmares...absolutely amazing...stayed with me days after I viewed it....hard to forget and easy to love...the perfect romantic suspense.....
5,Wrights 1-inch to 6-inch Tri Recs Tool,"I am a quilter and I needed this ruler for a specific quilt I was making, found it on Amazon, less expensive than if I had purchased it at my local quilt shop. The ruler worked great and the quilt came out absolutely stunning. Very glad I made this purchase. Will come back here more where I can compare prices."
5,worth the price,"This shampoo leaves your hair smooth and it looks healthy. It doesn't provide too much of volume, however it does exactly whatever it is in the description of the product"
3,Good delivery - wrong product,"Quick delivery with efficient packaging. However, they delivered Bain Satin 2 and not 1 as described, so YMMV. Not a big deal for me as I am borderline slightly dry to actually dry hair."
3,"Great book, however...","This is a great book - creative and kid friendly. My only concern is that some of the words are not clear enough for children to read. With some changes in the fonts and the size of the words, this book would be fabulous!!!"
3,collecting the intangible,"The art in this book really grabbed me. It features big headed kids in a luminous landscape. The unusual story features a dreamy and imaginative younger brother who wants to start an unconventional collection, words, which he later turns into a story. It reminds me of THE PUDDLE PAIL, by Elisa Kleven, in which a younger brother, a blue crocodile, collects puddles which he later turns into a watercolour painting collection. Sure to get kids thinking about unusual collections beyond the usual stamps, coins, etc!"
3,"well, yes, but . . .",I liked the basic idea but it went on too long and didn't deserve a whole book in my opinion.
5,Great Advice!,"I bought this book about 30+ years ago and loaned it to a friend. When it didn't come back, some 20+ years later, I ordered a new one. I told a friend about it recently, and ordered one for her. It's a great book and helps you remember that, the only person over which you have any control is YOU. I have to remind my self of this daily; it's easy to get caught up in worrying about what someone thinks of you, which brings on a whole new set of problems."
4,A good read,"I enjoyed this book and think its content is very useful to everyday life. I admire Terry Cole Whittaker way of thinking or self belief. And I think a book like this is very useful. And good at making you aware of your own behavior and how you relate to others. A very good read and I would recommend this book to anyone as a guide to be a better rounded, grounded person and hopefully with it success. Worth the read. It is old and a bit religious but general content good from a well balanced person who knows what she is talking about."
2,What You Think Of Me is None Of My Business,"Not as great as I was anticipating; a lot of preaching! Great title, but that's about it. Save your money!"
4,Fascinating,I have only read the first few chapters and have recommended to friends already. Great read for anyone. I wish I read it years ago.
1,"If you want a good motivational read, go someplace else","This has to be the worst book that i have read in a long time, she write's with a bunch of double talking never really giving clear idea's. Reading the title it sounds like a good read, one that would help you to get a better prospective on life. But instead she alluded to the idea that there is no ""right and wrong"" in life rather just state's of mind. If you want inspirational thinking and idea mining go read ""Think and Grow Rich"" by Napoleon Hill."
5,Terry = a true friend.,"My mom gave me one of Terry's books to read, ""Love and Power in a world with out limits"". I have re-read it over 5 times. I feel like she talks striaght to me as the smartest friend with the best advice. I recomend any of her books to anyone who wants peace of mind in thier lives and over all true unconditional love. After reading her books I have lost wieght, gained self respect and love, and made my exsisting relationships sweeter. It is easier for me to see love in everyone and everything. THANK YOU TERRY!!!"
5,Why do you care?,"Why do you care about what other people think? What matters is what you think. Terry Cole Whittaker explains this in basic terms, to help people get their ego out of the way. We are in control of ourself, other people can think what they want and always do. We can only control what we think of ourselves.People who lack confidence, care about what others think. Great read!"
1,Not Much Help At All,"For a person who seriously has problems with low self-esteem or agoraphobia, this book provides no insight or solution. Terry Cole Whittaker is a religious minister, not a psychologist. Ms. Cole Whittaker is well meaning, but misses the point by asking her readers to rely on (a Christ based) God. She doesn't even explain HOW to rely on God. At times I felt like I was reading Dr. Laura. For spiritually based solutions to this problem, it's a decent book, but psychological self-help, it's not.I guess my biggest disappointment was I thought I was going to get Dr. Scott Peck kind of wisdom, instead I got Dr. Laura ""morality."""
2,KARMA,"Most people have gone through bad relationships and been hurt. These lyrics certainly capture those feelings. Usually, such a cathartic process of writing about a bad time will bring a mature person to understand themself more and their own shortcomings, but these lyrics do not demonstrate any of that part of the process, if it existed at all for this artist. So, when you fail to learn from mistakes, you repeat them, or have them repeated on you. What comes around, goes around or so the saying goes - sorry you were so hurt, but then again, were you sorry you hurt me? I doubt you even noticed you are so wrapped up in yourself. Nice guitar playing - for the next CD, just keep that and throw out the words and the quasi-personality.You sow what you reap."
5,Such a great series,This is such an amazing series that ended waaayyy to soon. I highly recommend picking this up! Getting both season in one order is wonderful.
2,Pushing Daisies: The Complete First and Second Seasons,"Pushing Daisies: The Complete First and Second SeasonsI purchased this hoping for a ""boxed"" set, possibly bonus materials.Since this set is an additional $4.51,the best value is to purchase Season 1 and Season 2 separately."
5,FANTASTIC!,"This DVD set was in perfect condition, arrived in a timely manner, and was priced appropriately. I am very happy with my purchase. Just wish ""Pushing Daisies"" lasted longer as a series! Quirky, comical writing. Actors - terrific for their parts. Set design, colors schemes, costuming - everthing was terrific! Ah, to love, but never to touch. . ."
5,"Don't think, just buy!","This show so was magical and amazing. The only bad thing about the show was that it was cancelled!! If you like a little romance, a little comedy, and a little supernatural, then this is for you. In addition to the complete seasons 1 and 2, there's some bonus material too!"
5,Miss this show!,"I didn't find this show until it was off the air, but I'm glad someone got this for me for Christmas! Miss the show, wish they would bring it back!"
5,"Beautiful, relaxing CD with all the lyrics included - really lovely.","This lovely CD has intuitively been created for everyone - to sit with and enjoy. Excellent voices, various instruments, and professional musicians imbue this work with spiritual influences that are deeply meditative and illuminating, resonating gifts to you that I have no doubt you will want to hear and experience over and over and over again.Many thanks to Azima and her cohorts in compostition. This is a wonderful creation.Peace.Pax GaiaRobin Kilgour"
4,fun romantic comedy with a likable cast,"I think it got good reviews when it first came out, and though reviewers have been less enthusiastic with the dvd release, I was pleasantly entertained by this fun, romantic comedy. The cast is quite likable, with Kate Bosworth as a West Virginia grocery clerk who wins a date with Josh Duhamel's Hollywood hunk needing a PR boost. Also in the mix: Topher Grace as the young store manager secretly in love with Bosworth's Rosalee. The supporting cast includes fine performances from Gary Cole, Nathan Lane and Sean Hayes, and while the plot itself is predictable, the dialogue is quite good.DVD extras include 16 deleted scenes, a gag reel, stills, cast and crew information and production notes. The film can be heard in English or French and subtitles are available in English, French or Spanish."
3,Breathless,"We should give this teenager movie the benefit of a doubt. All of you would have read the storyline by now and believe you me, this movie is surprisingly entertaining and good. All those actors & actresses here are so relaxed and comfortable with their roles and with appearances by Sean Hayes (Will & Grace), Nathan Lane (Lion King, the Producer), Gary Cole to provide comical relief, this movie is light but good akin to a wholesome salad. The message from the movie is simply this: follow your heart. If you love someone so much, go with your feeling. As one character in the movie said simply: once I filed for my job application, I got luckier in getting the job. If you have a dream, pursue it. It's better to break your heart, with all knowing that you have tried your best rather than mumbling to yourself forever, I wish....Don't wish, just do it!"
1,So bad you wonder how it got made...,"This movie is so ridiculous with so many unbelievable scenes that the only enjoyable aspect is laughing at how ridiculous it is. Based on the overall reviews I was expecting something a little more entertaining. Rosalee goes from taking her retainer out on her big date with Tad and placing it right at the table like a gawky 12 year old (she's 22 so she's a little old for retainers) to offering sage wise commentary with the next breath. Likewise, Tad is very polite and agreeable when Rosalee's buddy Pete busts in on him on the toilet in a restaurant and just sits there smiling while Pete lectures him. You can predict the rest of the plot from this point."
2,Boring and predictable,"Queue in the drums and now the trumpet...and the award for the crappiest, most predictable, stupidiest movie goes to: Win a date with Tad Hamilton!... Congratulations."
2,Predictable teen comedy,"A predictable teen comedy but with enjoyable ensemble performances. One question: why is Gary Cole (the father) wearing a ""Project Greenlight"" T-shirt. The movie is not a Miramax product so why the endorsement of the Ben Affleck/Matt Damon project?"
4,Bubbly movie,"This is one of the movies me and my friend turn to when we want a movie that gives you a bubbly warm feeling inside. In the movie, Rosalee (bosworth) is totally in love with big-screen movie star tad Hamilton. tad has a bit of,well,a bad image, and as a hope to clean his image up a bit he teams up with save the children so that with an applicatio and $100 donation, some lucky girl get to go on a date with tad. That girl is rosalee.Tad falls an love with her after the date, and trackes her down in frasier bottom west virginia, meanwhile rosalee's friend pete is madly in love with her. It has one of those feel good ending where rosalee and tad realize that they are not right for eacher other, and after a small chase rosalee and pete end up together. Now they need a sequel for pete and rosalee!"
1,Eric Forman's Nightmare,"The movie starts out, as many have already noted, with the closing scene from one of teen idol Tad Hamilton's cornball movies. It then switches to a scene where Tad is driving all over the road while drinking and smoking. The next day he is reminded by his manager of his tarnished boy next door image and of a win a date contest to polish it. The winner of the contest is Rosalee who, unbeknownst to her, has been admired for years by her friend Pete. Will Rosalee chose the rich Hollywood phoney or settle for the real boy next door in her hometown?The trouble here is that on top of being predictable is that mostly this movie is just not funny. You could over look the predictability of the story if there had been a few laughs.They could've made this a satire of cornball love stories or as a parody of the disposable Hollywood teen idol. Instead they did neither.Topher Grace is still playing this as though he were on ""That 70's Show."" Unfortunately for all of us he isn't."
3,Suprisingly Fun,"I just saw this movie on on TV & was surprised how much I liked it. I'd seen the DVD cover-art & thought ""Ugh, that looks lame!"" but the movie is really cute! Light, funny and charming.Josh Duhamel is perfect as the hunky famous movie-star & Kate Bosworth does a great job as the sweet girl-next-door.Nathan Lane even makes an appearance as Josh's agent - awesome.The story is basically cute normal girl meets a hot rich guy...and the hyjinks begin.Not exactly WAR & PEACE, but very cute and entertaining. Definitely worth watching on a rainy day or if you're just in the mood for something fluffy & fun."
3,Good...but not Great,"I have never seen a movie promoted so much! Every other commercial was about this movie. It was going to be the blockbuster of the summer. Then why did it not even make half of what it cost? Because both guys are too amazing! This movie is hilarious, no question about it, Topher Grace is the next great thing in comedy. But Josh is great too! The problem with this movie is that you don't know who to root for! You want both guys to win and don't want either guy to lose! If only they had made ""Tad"" a little more dislikable we could have been satisfied at the end. The only thoughts running through my head at the end were...""Aww...how sweet..but wait! What about Tad?! He deserves a happy ending too."" So this movie definatly has it's high points, but it's just not that satisfying."
3,Sweet,"Okay, this movie was a little whack at times. Such as when Josh decides to buy a farm in West Virginia after knowing Kate for a few days. C'mon now. How real is that? HOWEVER, this movie is endearing. You cannot help but fall in love with Kate and you will get sucked in by Josh. All the while, you are wondering how it is so obvious that Topher is head over heels in love with Kate, but nobody else notices, other than the woman in love w/ him! LOL. but, this is a fun movie that I will watch again, whenever I need to be reminded that there is true love out there. I hope I find the man who can give me all those sweet details!! Go rent it today :)"
3,not bad not bad,it is a very predictable movie but its funny and a good chick flick for when you just wanna hang out with your friends!
1,Horrible,"I usually love the average 'Chick flick'... but this was horribly lame and cheesy. No depth to the characters, no chemistry either. My 13 year old even agreed with me, this one is worth skipping.(...)"
3,NotSoGood...,"This was an ok movie. The only reason I sat through it all the way is because of Topher Grace. He's so hansome (way better looking than J.D.). He's also a great actor, but him and Bosworth don't go together. Bosworth's charachter was not developed enough into who she was suposed to be and her best friend was a little over the top."
1,Please O merciful God,"I'm starting to wonder..if there truly was a god, why would he have alowwed the creation of this hellish trash. I watched this movie against my will, and was forced to see it start to finish. To save money, why use lethal injection..jus buy a DVD player and pop in this. Is ten times for cruel than anything humanly possible. I know what they means in the bible where the bible they say ""and Jesus suffered indescribable torture""..funny, I thought this movir came out recently...In a rating of one to four stars, I'd rather be flown into burning hot star than watch this again. If writing bad movies was a job, these guys'd be filthy rich.If I had a choice of smashing my self with a rock or watching this movie, I go out and find the biggest boulder I could and smash away. ...These are where nightmares come from."
2,Predictable Predicatable,"It is not so much that the movie was predictable. As much as just didn't wasn't all that great.The saving grace of this movie was Topher Grace who is just an amazing gifted actor from Traffic,Ocean Eleven, and so on. Made it worthwhile to see this movie. Not to mention the talented actress who played Kate Bosworth best friend was underuse in this movie. Josh who is great in the series Las Vegas not so in this movie."
1,Not too clever romantic comedy,"When I saw that the movie was from the creators of Legally Blonde, I figured it would be original and hilarious, boy was I wrong. It is so ridiculously predictable, I mean they should have put a twist somewhere in the plot. The plot wasnt even that great. When Topher Grace was trying to show is affection for Kate Bosworth he was being too mean and way too obvious. I mean Kate Bosworth's character had to be stupid not to see that Topher was in love with her. Plus Bosworth's character was quiet annoying. Her hair was bothering me the whole movie, and that whole retainer thing at dinner was such a weird part. I agree with another review who said ""what 22 year old would wear a retainer let alone take it out on a date with a moviestar"" let alone on a date with a human, it was gross. I would not recommend this movie , entirely too predictable and too lame to enjoy."
1,Just So Predictable....,"Ok let me get this straight. This is one of the most precdictable movies I have ever seen. Win A Date With Tad Hamilton!, guess what happens? She wins a date with Tad Hamilton. Thats all! Robert Luketic has gone from one of the most funniest and enjoying films (LEGALLY BLONDE) to this crap! The casting is apalling except for her friend (manager of the piggly wiggly). The first date is sooooo boring and pointless and some of the deleted scenes should have been put in (eg when Paris Hilton lands in the pool). This movie has probablly copied every romantic-comedy there is with its OH SO HOLLYWOOD story and ending. Kate Bosworth has talent but none is shown here. If you have found that this review has said nothing well thats whats in the movie NOTHING. Or at least it seems. I REMAIN DISSAPOINTED!"
1,I just watched this boring movie.,"This movie was pretty lame. I gave it 1 star but it actually doesn't deserve that!!! It was drawn out, stupid and (yawn) boring!!! Thank god it was just a rental and not a purchase. I will say that Toby from ""that 70's show"" was pretty good. and the guy who played Tad was very good looking but that's about it... kate was very average. kinda like another kate (Hudson) who is so over rated too. Oh and look for the guy who plays Tad on a show called ""Vegas"" on NBC. That is where I remembered seeing him before this movie. At least on that show he isn't just a pretty boy, he actually acts too. (lol)"
5,Win a date with Tad Hamilton,"I got the honor of seeing the sneak preview last night for this movie. It was the greatest movie ever. There are no words to decscribe it because it was sooooo good. It was fantastic, faboulous...everything. Kate Bostworth was cute in her role as Rosalee, a small-town West Virginian who enters a charity contest to win a date with a Tom Cruish like actor, Tad Hamilton. She wins the contest and goes to Hollywood, inwhich Tad ends up falling for her. Josh Duhamel from NBC's ""Las Vegas"" plays Tad. He shines in this movie! Soon, Tad comes to West Virginia because he wants her goodness to rub off on him. Rosealee's best friend Pete (Topher Grace )is also falling in love with her at the same time. This movie is the best movie of 2004, thus far and is destined to become a hit. Everyone, GO SEE IT!!!!!"
4,funny,"This was a funny film about admiring people. Kate Bosworth is perfect in the lead role as a West Virginia grocery clerk who has a crush on a movie star. What she doesn't know is that a fellow employee has similar feelings for her. When she wins a contest to be with the star, the movie star starts idolizing her. Complications ensue. I think this was a romantic movie that had its moments. I recommend it to anyone who likes romantic comedies. Shake a doo!"
4,Surprise,"I decided to see this movie after seeing an ad in a magazine, but mostly just for poking fun at yet another crappy romance. To my surprise, it was very charming!! Topher Grace did an outstanding job. The only con for me was the ending; kind of tacky, but i mean, it's a romance, what else can you expect!*If you enjoy fun romantic comedies with cheesy endings, test this one."
4,Great for separating your bed.,"Great for separating your bed. You and your spouse will be able to sleep in peace. No, not that kind of bed! A truck bed, silly...This fit in by Chevy C10 stepside just barely (bed width about 48 1/2"") but I'm glad it did. I have it installed by the tailgate so it will keep grocery bags upright and secure while driving home. It won't damage your bed as long as you install it properly, it has two rubber skids on each end that should wedge in nicely. It was simple to assemble, and has a very nice looking spotted grey metal finish. The pouch will hold small items, but they may come out if you hit a big bump.This is a great solution to organizing your truck bed better!EDIT Apr 8, 2010: The rubber end skids fell off and got lost. Now I can't use it anymore else I'll scratch my bed paint. I will have to make a custom rubber pad of some sort before I use it again. If you get this product, make sure the skids are glued on good and tight."
3,For Beginners,"Very, very basic. Suitable for children and beginners wanting simple artsy-craftsy stuff along the lines of the pictures on the cover. Very little of the contents will carry over into fine work.If you are interested in learning fine leatherwork, an excellent alternative is this book:The Leatherworking Handbook: A Practical Illustrated Sourcebook of Techniques and Projects"
5,The Story of May,My daughter and I fell in love with this story wheh she was a child. We followed May through the months of relatives on a wonderful adventure. Mordical Gerstein gives such fantastic personalities to each month personality and teaches a lesson of love and family bonds along the way. A great addition to the rest of his books!
3,Not the quality expected from Seiko,"I bought this watch as a gift. I liked the idea of never needing a battery. It has the see through case back that is great for the guy who likes gadgets. It is extremely heavy (which my boyfriend didn't like). It looked very nice in the box but, once my boyfriend took it out and started setting the time and pushing on the button that checks the charge, we found that it was not put together very well. The button that is pushed to check the charge can easily be pulled out. It feels cheap. I would not have expected such poor quality from Seiko. It is a very heavy, large watch but the button and some black parts on the sides of the case feel like plastic. I was not impressed with this watch at all. I ended up returning this watch and getting the Citizen Men's Corso Eco-Drive Watch BM8120-56E. It is solar powered (no battery needed) and titanium, which my boyfriend loves. And half the price (which I love)."
5,top quality,I bought this and it's my first Seiko.My dad have had a Seiko too and he used it for over 20 years . I hope I will use my watch for a long time as much as my dady.You can buy this watch without thinking because it's top quality.
3,Good entry level skate,"These skates are pretty decent. I use them for roller derby. I will definitely be upgrading to something with metal plates and leather boots when I have the money, but these are very serviceable. I recommend getting the wheel upgrade as the stock wheels (Radar Caymans) are terrible and useful only throwing at thing, painting as trophies or used a 'cones' in setting up practice courses. The demon wheels are a little better."
2,If You're Not Concerned With Quality..................,"Then you will enjoy this CD otherwise it's a waste of money, mostly Vinyl records transferred to CD and poorly done at that. You can clearly hear vinyl noise and pops/crackles. There should be a law that CD's transfered from vinyl records should state so on the package. I wasted my money.""D-"""
2,Marred by Poor Sound Quality,"Not a bad selection, but it sounds like many of these tracks were mastered from vinyl. You'd be better off springing for a comp. from Rhino, Hi-Bias, or a major label. They have the budget to find original masters."
3,If you were in high school during the 80's....,"My younger brother bought this one. I took a listen and while many of the tracks I relish from the 80's, a good number of the remaining ones suffered from the ""extended"" versions featured on this compilation.The longer/remixed versions of Blondie's ""Rapture"", Rick James's ""Super Freak"", ""You Dropped a Bomb on Me"" (The Gap Band) and ""Rock Steady"" by The Whispers are welcome jams that are timeless.However, cuts like ""Last Night a DJ Saved My Life"" (Indee), ""Ain't Nothing Going on But the Rent"" (Gwen Guthrie), ""The Show"" by Doug E. Fresh and a few others had their ""moment in the sun"" in that decade and were more appreciated by my sibling's 30-something-year-old ears than my slightly more ""mature and refined"" late 40's-year-old ones.What a difference a decade and a half makes! Sheesh!"
3,Bueno,"Es un accesorio muy practico si tienes el videonow, por que lo puedes guardar, proteger y tiene un compartimiento para los discos. Lo unico es que el mango deberia ser mas largo para que el niño lo pueda cruzar sobre su hombro y se le haga mas facil llevarlo de un lugar a otro."
5,Exactly What I Wanted in a Time-Travel Romance Novel!!!,"This book is part of those rare time-travel romance novels to cherish and enjoy. I recommend this book to anyone who are fanatics of time-travel romance novels, you won't regret it ^_^"
5,Great product,These arrived in a timely manner. just as advertised perfect ceramic pads installed in less than an hour and no sqweeks or noise at all.Awsome product for a great price these wer close to a hundred at the parts store!!!!
2,Moby Dick in the desert,"This is a friend's favorite book, and I tucked into it out of respect for her judgment. She's not the only one -- it seems that many people treasure The Towers. I found it slower going than camel travel, with long rambling diversions that reminded me of Melville's interminable descriptions of rope. If disliking his opus disqualifies me in your eyes as a reviewer, fair enough, but Ishmael and Laurie should get together sometime and bore each other to death."
4,A thrift store treasure,"I found a yellowing English edition of this paperback on the shelf at a thrift store and bought it on a whim, thinking, it's set in Turkey? My mother loved Turkey, so I'll read it. I was not prepared for what appears to be the originator of the Bridget Jones style of narration. Laurie, the narrating character, travels Turkey with her Aunt Dot and a grumpy retired cleric, Father Pigg. An amazing travelogue, it's told in breathless, run-on sentences, mostly hilarious and casual but interspersed with thoughtful and touching meditations on morality, faith and adulterous love. This is a fine, fine novel. I'm going to investigate more Rose Macauley through the third-party sellers on Amazon."
2,Pretty insipid,"Although book was highly reviewed as a ""rediscovery,"" I found the descriptive material too weak and not engaging enough to be a good travel account. And the narrator told us little about herself, so the book did not serve well as a personal journey. Altogether disappointing."
4,How a uke should sound!!!,I have been a fan of the ukulele since growing up in Hawaii and hearing some really good players. IZ of course is a favorite with his ability to make a few clear notes have so much feeling. Troy in this CD captures some really great uke playing and has the ability to have a lot of flourish without going over the top(easy to do I guess). There is good feeling with some very complex playing. I would highly recommend this to someone new to the uke as well as those who have loved it for many years.
5,I love his style.,"Every time I put on this CD I am whisked away to somewhere peaceful, soothing, and tropical. I love his arrangements and his amazing ukulele playing. Very well recorded and sounds fantastic on a great set of speakers and turned up loud. Troy really knows how to play the ukulele."
4,Amazing Deal!!!!,"I was very skeptical about this chandelier because it was so cheap. I was pleasantly surprised when it came. It is very soft and a wonderful accent to any room. It provides a great deal of light due to having six bulbs. The shades help to diffuse the light, creating a nice ambiance. I am 100% satisfied wiht this product."
1,Don't waste your money,Terrible! Weighs a ton - takes 6 mintutes to toast; can't do basic microwaving. You have to change out the racks between microwaving and toasting - too much of a hassle and crumbs everwhere. We re-packed this for return almost immediately!
2,Rival combo oven,"I have had this oven for under a year. It now no longer works-it appers to have a loose wire as it loses power in any cycle or when at rest, and cannot be restarted.The wire rack is flimsy and when removing tends to fall out towards you and also falls through the back. With hot food this is DANGEROUS! I semi solved this problem by gluing pieces of magnet squares above the rack holder, so the rack couldn't tip.The broiler works pretty well.I had a GE combo oven for years (it finally died after about 20 years) and Rival was the only combo oven I have been able to find to replacement it.I have just called Rival and they are replacing the oven-that's pretty good!."
2,Terrible rusting problem,"The concept here is very good however the execution by Rival is awful. The condensation that drips all over the inside and then on the counter when you open the door, is just terrible. In less than a year the whole inside has rusted out. We try to dry it after use but you can never get all of it, thus the rusting problem is chronic. I was looking for another brand and saw that there is a Sharp product with the same features that I might try but the microwave wattage is only 650. The Rival is bad enough at 700 but I can't bring myself to buy another one of their products after the performance of this one."
4,Remember: Only Dopes Use Dope...,Meth Dealers become murderers leading to their being stalked and killed by a mysterious avenger. This is another excellent low-low-budget horror effort. Lots of eerie atmosphere and a menacing mineshaft! Also available on DECREPIT CRYPT OF NIGHTMARES...
3,Not what I expected,"I was expecting this book to not only show vintage graphics but also a description of each graphic, but to my dissappoitment it does not include any text. Also, the binding cuts off a lot of the pictures and makes it difficult to open completely flat.That being said, this is a wonderful book with interesting photos. I would definetly recommend this to someone looking for a picture book, but definetly not to someone who is looking for descriptions and origins of these fascinating graphics.This book includes pictures of children on halloween, postcards, and old advertisements from the 1900's-1960's."
3,Leather much heavier than pictured.,"This may be good or bad depending on what you're looking for. The leather is a heavy pebble grain, as mentioned, but NOT like the close-up picture. There's no way this coat would have the folds like those in the picture. Way too heavy for spring or fall. A good winter coat if you like the style."
4,Great for a certain player,"I'm the kind of player who uses a lot of spin, and I like a lot of control over the ball so I can make precision shots. This racquet is great for that. It offers a lot of control, and just feel great to use when you hit the ball with a lot of spin. It's not a great one for power hitters though."
5,Can't Live Without One,"I've tried several grills and none are as useful as Nathan's. It's light weight, can be used as a ""Miracle Thaw"", and very inexpensive. I've bought several and given them as gifts."
1,Subpar at best,"I bought this grill very excited about being able to grill without having the hassle of dealing with the elements of the outdoors. After one use and one wash, this grill was a total bust. The non-stick layer started to peel off. I used it this weekend for the 3rd time and I bought a new cast iron grill on Amazon today. Nathan's really should be ashamed to have their name on a product of such low quallity. I was very disappointed and a total waste of $20."
1,Cancelled with season 2 cliffhanger ending,"Show was really good until it got cancelled. Summer is awesome as always, but season 2 ends with one hell of a cliffhanger and then the show was cancelled. Save your money"
2,Probella,It is of good quality but not as effective as I hoped for. May be usefull for full sun conditions.
5,Progressive Bluegrass at its Finest!,"5 Star Newgrass/Progressive Bluegrass!Reviewer: Steve Sikes-Nova, 'The Virginiaprograsser'This, Candlewyck's first full-length studio CD (they are currently working on #2!), is one of the best newgrass/progressive bluegrass CDs out there. All aspects of this CD are excellent: songwriting, production, musicianship, and vocals. If you are a seasoned newgrasser or want a can't-miss introduction into the genre, buy this CD!!!:)Steve Sikes-Nova'The Virginiaprograsser'""Newgrass, Prog & More!"" 4+ Star Web Radio on Live365.comhttp://www.live365.com/stations/virginiaprograsser/"
5,I LOVE IT,"I am a big Tommy fan. I have this comfortor in Queen. It washes really well in my home washer and dryer. The color is beautiful, and It is really soft and nice and I can't say enough great things about it. I have the chino kahki in king sized and i also have a tommy flag design. the pink is my favorite by far. i paid a lot more for mine, too. this is a good price"
5,I can relate to this,I found Love Matters quite moving and could really relate to the little character and the ups and downs in life. I found it reassuring to know that I am not the only person out there that finds it difficult to be vulnerable and real. Loved the cartoon about 'emotional trophies'!
2,proceed with caution,"I bought this book for review purposes and to branch out my vocabulary a bit, but I've been very disappointed to find numerous typos and errors in both English and Japanese. Now I always have to check words against another Japanese dictionary to be sure the ones in this book are correct. If you already know a fair amount of Japanese and kanji, it's pretty easy to catch the errors, but if you're a newer student trusting this text implicitly, then proceed with extreme caution."
5,KATHY MATTEA : FROM THE HEART,"A NICE KATHY MATTEA MUSIC VIDEO, HAS COME FROM THE HEART,18 WHEELS AND A DOZEN ROSES, THE BATTLE HYMN OF LOVE & WHERE'VE YOU BEEN, from PolyGram."
5,Wonderful hand cream,This is an excellent hand cream. Makes your hands feel really soft without being greasy. Wonderful fragrance. Makes an excellent gift
3,Screen Door Grille,"I love the look of this screen door grille, but have had issues with installation. It did not arrive with screws - it took me so long to get around to installing that I did not realize this until it was too late (my bad). I am using this so my dog realizes there is a screen, as having him walk through the screen door has gotten pricey. For installation - I tried random screws I had and it screws kept loosening up; I then tried velcro but this only worked until it got cold outside; not sure what I will try next spring/summer to get it back up."
3,Behind The Green Door,"The movie is an attempt to elevate porn to a higher level by adding a story line. Because of its low budget, it lacks the polish we are accustom in todays movies. However, its a serious attempt to produce a quality movie with substance. It breaks new ground during its time with interracial sex, mild fetish and other acts of pleasure. Its slow starting and slow moving, certainly not an action movie. Its certainly worthy of a remake using todays modern movie technology."
5,Being taken...,"For me, this is on a par with ...Misty Beethoven and The Devil in Miss Jones. The premise is one of abduction (no violence) and being seduced, being prepared for and finally, 'being taken' in two basic scenes. The voyeurs who attend the private club, witness the events and as they do so, explore themselves and others to varying degrees of intensity and indeed, penetration. It's fun as well as being explicit and erotic. (P.S. ...Misty Beethoven and ...Miss Jones are currently unavailable for review).Ian Hunter.Author of `e-Love'."
3,review,this movie suffered from its lack of plot. Perhaps if you were out of your rational mind it would be of help in watching the movie.
2,A Condescending view of the genre,"This book seems as if it were written to impress a tenure committee. The author clearly doesn't like horror literature, and his constant jibes at the works he discusses, though occasionally amusing, make one wonder why he has spent so much time on the subject. As you might expect from a critic who doesn't ""get"" the genre, his readings are shallow. M. R. James, for example, is portrayed as merely a skillful purveyor of gore. Worse, Kendrick reads all the works as having the same meaning. In his view, an attachment to such literature is puerile.I did learn a few things from this book--for example, the history of horror in the theater was mostly new to me, and probably will be to many genre addicts. On the whole, though, the author simply knows less about his subject than most of his readers will."
4,a conservative reader,"This book was one of a number that I have read with a liberal bias. I felt that the author presented his views clearly. When the topic was presented in a factual manner, I appreciated his efforts. His bias is accepted. As a liberal, I understand that he is at best, not a proponent of Reagan, Bush, Bush, Nixon, and Kissinger, but his snarky comments detracted from his scholarship. The dividing line that he has placed between conservatives and liberals reflects his confirmation bias and purpose in writing this book. Balance, Please. Each side has its angels and demons"
4,interesting but not what i expected,expected more on jefferson but was mostly on his relationship with current mystics. still a good read.
2,Liberal agenda.,"This is a perfect example of someone not doing their homework. That someone is me. The title sold the book to me. Problem is, this book was barely more than a diatribe on how big corporations are destroying the middle class in America. That's fine if that's your agenda, just don't use the ruse of ""What Would Jefferson Do?"" There's no way that Jefferson would endorse this much government involvement, not even in today's world."
1,Too far left to be associated with Jefferson,"I couldn't finish this book. After about 25% of the book, the author's leftist views were too overwhelming. I had originally purchased it expecting a book about returning to the Constitution, but I was mistaken.When the author wrote on historical events, it was very interesting. He talks about the Native Americans and truth about the Boston Tea Part, which was great, but then he goes into bashing George Bush. I stopped reading once I came across a statement that connoted that the Founding Fathers' views were not the same as the views of Libertarians."
2,Disappointing. . .,"While Mr.Hartmann has impressive credentials and does make a few good points, he continually broadbrushes issues throughout his book and tosses around a lot of tiring old rhetoric. And while I do applaud his efforts at offering some solutions, there are a number of suggestions he makes that point to his lack of first hand experience with various issues.The book was not very well connected and several times as I was starting to get interested, he lost me with some ill placed (and/or ill posed) examples or verbal mudslinging. Overall, a disappointment."
3,Good but last game is better,The new Fire Emblem is okay but it is recycled from the original Fire Emblem. If you like Fire Emblem I recomend it.
2,"As a game, Sacred Stones is average. as a sequal, its a joke","Basically, what we have here is the same game.Seriously. Intelli Sys recycled like 60% of the content from FE1(7 in jpn)? The only ""new"" things here are what you'd already expect in a sequel anyway: a new plot and new character designs.Why would anyone pay full price to play exactly the same game all over again? It boggles the mind. On the pc we have what are called ""expansion packs"". This ""sequel"" does nothing new what the previous game hasn't already done. And the previous one, which I've reviewed, wasn't that impressive either.In short, go ahead and buy this if you liked the first one and want more of the same. If the previous Fire Emblem didn't do much for you however, don't expect anything different."
3,Not as interesting as I had hoped,"This game looked very interesting to me but when I started playing it, I was left unimpressed. I have not been enjoying the chapter breakdown of play in the least. I prefer the more continuous play that appears in games like ""Golden Sun"" and the ""Legend of Zelda"" series. Yes, there are challenges to overcome in those games but you're not stopped so the next challenge can be explained to you. This might make a nice game for a younger crowd but not for adults where the chapter breakdown might be very helpful.The graphics are the best part of this game; they are beautiful."
3,Fire Emblem is a harsh mistress,"Having been hooked by Path of Radiance and happily slogging through Radiant Dawn, I needed all things Fire Emblem. Unfortunately all I can do is go backwards through the catalog. Shadow Dragon was updated well and didn't lose many of the nice features of the console versions. Sadly, Sacred Stones looks and plays like the Super Nintendo version, it just feels ancient and minimal."
4,Neverending fun!,"The campaign itself is short compared to other fire emblem games, and only average enjoyment compared to the others. However, what sets this game apart from the other fire emblem games is the freedom you enjoy, thanks to the world map and the monster levels you can visit continually. While the campaign itself is short, you can actually play a file forever, as even after the campaign is finished you can still continue to improve your team and fight hordes of monsters. You even gain access to new shops and the secret characters after you beat the campaign. Overall, the game can entertain you for as long as you want - there is no end to the fun!"
3,alright...,It was okay. It kind of repeated itself and missions always seemed the same. good for a road trip or boredom but nothing to get totally immersed in.
5,Geat RPG,"Really like this game, the character plots and storyline speeches can get annoying but you can skip them, thankfully."
4,Great game!,"This was my first Fire Emblem game. Though I had no clue how to play, I learned very quickly. This game is a battling game mixed with a LOT of strategy. There are also three different difficulty levels to challenge more experienced players.The basic game play is sort of a giant chess board. You move your characters around this field and battle enemies. Each battle lasts at least 20 minutes, and there are 20 story battles. The is another feature called Creature Campain, where you battle more monsters and unlock more characters apart from unlockable characters in the story. It's not know as a fact, but in my game, I have maybe 40 different soldiers.The one thing people may not like is that afer beatin the game once, some people may not be encouraged to beat the game a second time.Overall, this game will keep you busy fo awhile, and you'll have fun playing it, but it may not be the game you would like to play over and over again. 4 stars!"
5,"not bad, nintendo, youve don it again","this is sweet. but, it's complicated. and frustrating. because if youre like me, you'll wanna get every single character that you can get in the stinkin game and that takes skill and strategy. plus,(this is a spoiler) u can get extra secret characters like the swordmaster ismaire (the queen of white dunes) or Valter the wyvern knight or even Hayden, the Sage King (but he comes as a ranger i'm confused because of that). get this game cuz u can now have a better team thats spread out for better combos. like this: 1 hit-kill army: myrmidons, swordmasters, and assassins. gogogo! but, if you're planning to upgrade your pegasus knights, don't do it before u get syrene, the falco knight. cuz if u hav three guys surroundin an enemy, and they are all flyin pegasuses, u can do a rare and hard attack to pull off. BEHOLD, THE PEGASUS TRIANGLE ATTACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NOW GO BUY IT BUY IT BUYIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Pair of Jeeps,"Wife & I are 60'ish, haven't ridden bikes in years but wanted to get back into it for casual exercise on flat terrain. We really enjoy these Jeep Overlands...May not be a purists idea of a bike, but suits our needs well.Quality is better than I expected with a nice fit...Only exception was the saddle - we needed w-i-d-e-r and softer, so had them replaced. They hang off the back of the motorhome and get used wherever we camp....Light enough for one person to lift. If I was to buy new bikes today, I'd order just what we did originally."
4,Excellent value for the money,"I wanted to get back into riding. The bike I had needed to be tuned up. After pricing those tune-up costs, I started to looked around to see what was available. I came across the Jeep Overland. It's so hard to believe the value you get for your money. It rides soooo smoothly and the shifting is something my older bike never gave me. I have ridden some other high end bikes and I saw very little difference in performance between them and the Jeep Overland, but major difference between the Jeep and your low end 10 speeds. The only problem I found (being I am short) this bike sits a little higher than my other 26"", keep that in mind if you are short. But this bike is well worth your money!"
2,Low quality starter bike,"As soon as I opened the box I could see that this was a low quality bike. The JEEP labels and ""Made in China"" stickers had already started peeling off. Both wheels had bends in them. Assembly took several hours as everything that could be adjusted needed to be adjusted. I gave up on the Deralieur (sp?) in the end and took it to my local pro bike shop for adjustment. After 2 min the pro asked me ""How much did you pay for this bike?"". Even with his best efforts the bike will not go into the lowest gear and stay there. A turn of the handle bars clicks it out of gear. Its a cheap bike, but you get what you pay for."
4,As anticipated!,"I purchased the Jeep Overland after comparing many bikes on different web-sites. This bike is VERY nice for the price, and has exceeded my expectations! Easy to finish assembly with few tools needed. I'm a 52 year old who is biking again for the first time in 20 years, and couldn't be happier! Great exercise and FUN!!!"
4,"jeep overland s, a comfortable ride","my wife and i bought the jeep overland s and are quite pleased with them. we are seniors and haven't been on a bike in 30 years, so we researched them in stores and on-line, and for the price we decided on the overland. we live in an area where the land is flat, so we can't comment on the roughness of mountain trails, but we have used them on off-road trails. after 4 months of riding we haven't had any problems. this is a good, all-round bike. bob g."
5,Argerich & Maisky - You can't go wrong,"My title for this review says it all. When these two collaborate, you'll get music-making of the highest order. That said, I had a bit of trepidation when I first became aware of this recording. I'd heard some of Yo Yo Ma's recordings of transcriptions for the cello from the original violin sonata, and while he always produced exemplary work (after all, he IS Yo Yo Ma), I wasn't convinced that the music survived the transition from violin to cello. Here, in the Franck, Maisky proved to me that this music is just as gorgeous and passionate when played on the cello. The notes tell me that Franck himself did the transcribing, but I'm sure that Mischa Maisky is the reason I was so taken with this recording. Needless to say, the Debussy sonata is also played as if it were the premiere work for the cello literature. The recorded sound is really excellent, helping one hear the emotion projected by these artists."
1,Maybe I should have bought a more expensive piece!,I bought this product for the handset speaker; it's less than a month and the speaker is not working.
1,not great,"after having this phone for a couple of months, the screen went completely blank, so I didn't have my caller id. Then, one day 6 months later, I dropped the phone really hard to the floor, adn the caller id and screen started working again. Also, this phone is uncomfortable to hold between your ear and shoulder with out using your hands."
1,handset lost speaker function after 2 months,"1. The handset speaker phone is broken after 2 months. It even lost its ringing function. Now it only works like a simple handset with caller ID.2. The number pad on the base and handset are too tiny. It's very difficult to press the numbers, and requires you to press hard and hold down.3. This is a 2.4GHz cordless phone, but it has bad reception. There is disturbing loud background hiss.The rest of the functions are still okay. This is the 4th GE phone I owned, and this is the worst."
4,A good buy,"The phone is good all respects, except for when there is a second call on waiting, you can't see the number properly as there is no backlit at the time of second call in."
5,So Fine,"These goblets are literally charming. I love them more than a normal person probably should. Just something about their sparkling clarity, their perfect size, perfect solid thickness, and the way they feel in the hand. Time to order a couple more of them - they're worth it."
3,Good Performance. Bad sound,Poor sound as usual from Opera D'Oro. But good to know Birgit Nilsson can sing live
4,Bike,It's ok. The bike is packaged well and is easily put together if one does not use the instructions.Good sturdy machine. A bit pricey.
4,a cool bike,this is the kind of bike that is fun and very laid back and you can cruise down the street with it.i got a chance to roll with one recently and these bikes are smooth and you can shift and just glide.
3,ok,It is a good bike for the price. My 13 year old son loves it.When we received it there were some dents and the logo stickers were barely on with bubbles everywhere. Stickers peeled off easily and it looks great with out all of them. Great kids bike and cheaper than the average cruiser.
1,"Looks Good On ""Paper""",Just disappointed is all....Wasn't what I expected and it's very cheaply made....
2,Can't see their faces!,"I bought the Mitsubishi VS50707 Gold analog Projection TV last week on word of mouth on how good Mitsubishi TV's are.Ouch! Should have went with a Magnavox. Cheaper and better in my opinion. Had one for 7 years and just sold it to get a new TV. The tubes were aging of course - but I thought it had a better picture than my new $2000.00 Mitsubishi! Sure, the overall picture is good. Close-up shots a great! But watching sporting events - one of the main reasons for getting a new TV now - long distance images were terrible! Can't make out Shaq's face! Football season is going to be a drag! Volume control from shows into commericals - look out! It's REALLY loud! Watching analog TV of course you'll see those lines. Wasn't as bad with my previous TV. Even with the tinted protection screen. Customer support on the problems - not good.Going to try and sale it and get a Magnavox. Still got time before Football season starts!"
5,We loved Kolo,My 9-yo daughter and I watched this and loved it. The footage is remarkable and the story is uplifting and heart breaking as well as being educational. The meerkats are adorable and it was great to hear Paul Newman's voice narration in what was obviously one of his last performances.
5,Outstanding music,One of the best and most interesting cd's I've bought in a long while. The music is outstanding. This CD has really beautiful and unique fiddle harmonies and a couple of wonderful original pieces. This duo sounds like no other and I can't wait to hear Fortuity Duo's next CD!
1,I still haven't received this purchase,I still haven't received this purchase. I have been waiting for over a month for this book to come. I need this book for my class
1,Poor quality,This is a very flimsy and breakable peice of jewlery...you could not tell from the photo.
2,mmm.. not realy at 100%,well i got this dvd drive and it works it reads cd - dvd - dl dvd and i like it.... but the only thing i didnt like about it is that it DOES NOT read blank cd - dvd - dl dvd an error pops out.............but if i usse nero or alcohol 120% it burns it good and il read perfectly...i dont know if its damaged or not...buy at your own risk.
2,I Couldn't Wait to Put It Down,"Wow, talk about a story that goes nowhere. This book would have been more interesting if the backstory had been THE story. There was no pull. I didn't feel for the characters. There wasn't really much romance. There was sex, but the romance was buried under all the mystery surrounding the murders and the vampire Lucien's appearances and disappearances. Drake tells stuff that could be left out and leaves out a lot that should be told."
4,not bad,I really enjoyed this book this was the first one i picked up by her and i also went back and read Beneath a Blood Red Moon and Deep Midnight but this was my fav. i recomed this to any vampire reader or ones that are just starting out with reading about vampires but their is people that are saying that it wasn't any good but if you are reading this then i think you should find out for yourself i know its not for everyone but hey give it a try go to the libray or a used bookstore it has a great story and great charators the romance was also very diffrent from anything else i have read in vampire romance or just romance but check it out.
3,Not a sure bet,i think that this book had alot of promise however it was not that good because this lucian and jade hardly spent anytime with each other we spent more time on sophia and darian. so really the way i saw it lucian coulden't really have loved jade he probably still saw her as his late wife so i love shannon drake but i think she can do better than that.
2,Did not think much of it,I thought the book was rather bland and perverse. Not much interaction between the 2 main characters and I found the suspense plot lacking as well.Bottom line: Do not recommend.
1,do not waste your time or money,"THIS BOOK WAS THE NEAREST NOTHING I HAVE EVER READ. SHE NEEDS TO TAKE LESSONS ABOUT WRITING VAMPIRE BOOKS FROM MAGGIE SHAYNE OR NANCY GIDEON OR CHRISTINE FEEHAN, IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THIS BOOK YET, PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON IT. TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS ONE."
1,Terrible,"This book started out well, but it is as if the author got VERY distracted about half way through. I did finish it, though it was painful. Cheesy. Bad dialogue! For true vampire genre fans, give this one a pass. I have not read the others in this series, so I cannot comment on those. After reading this one, however, I have no interest in the others."
1,Poor Editing,"Misspellings, using 1 instead of l. Just poor grammer, puncuation and page breaks all around. Characters are not well developed. A few funny moments but not enough to make worth while."
2,Disappointed,"I read the first book and was looking forward to the sequel. But I was disappointed. The sequel definitely does not match the quality of the original. Too much time was spent on descriptive passages and not enough on interaction between the two main characters. I enjoyed the minor characters, but occasionally got lost because there were quite a few of them. I think fewer surrounding characters would have been better. While the suspense and action was very well done, I wish there had been more relationship development between Lucian and Jade. There was so little of their relationship that leaving it out all together would not have materially changed the book. I know Ms. Drake can do much better."
4,a new title that was to follow in the series,"Since reading Beneath A Blood Red Moon, an excerpt was in the closing part of this new series and the next book was to be titled: The Tomb. I'd been searching for that title and only last year found the new title. I had the other names that followed but wanted to keep in sequence. The same with the historical Graham family which starts with Come The Morning. I've been trying to keep up with the names of them. I really have enjoyed what I've read so far and looking forward to reading the remainder. I've Scot in my ancestry and after doing research, found my Douglass ancestors' landholdings between The Bruce's and The Wallace's. I love history and Shannon Drake always gives such detail to make you feel as if you're actually part of it.the Thanks for enlightening me of the new names."
2,Started out ok,"This book started out great!I read the last book Beneath a Blood Red Moon,and could not wait to read it.Blah! The book just falls apart towards the middle.I could not sat focused.Im not planning on reading anymore of her vampire novels.They just seem to repeat themselves.I think Drake is turning into the Danielle Steele of Horror/Romance."
3,Kitty,"I picked up this book at work. I love to read, just about anything, and vampire books are really great. This one was okay, by that I mean, it was gruesome in some parts, but not to gruesome. The love scenes were sexy, but not overly so. This was my first read of Ms Drake and I will read more books by her. Already ordered the other two in the trilogy. (...)"
1,Wolfman Jack's One Hit Wonders,"The CD has a small-print warning on the back ""All selections...new stereo recordings...by the featured artists...."" If you're buying this album to recoup some original rock and roll hits, don't bother!"
2,LEAKING BASE,"This blender leaks at the base where the blade is inserted, even when wetting the seal as recommended. A real disappointment for a blender that crushes ice so well."
2,False advertisement,"Doesn't blend icy drinks as promised - leaves you with chunks of ice or overblended. The only good thing is the large capacity jar. The lid is awkward to secure & there is a gap between the lid & the center of the lid which you usually can drop things into while blending, but the gap between is definitely not leak proof. My old Oster blender/food processor combo did better but it had broken. I just bought another Oster hoping I'll have better luck."
1,Tried to be optimistic!,"I really liked the price and the features of this blender, and I love the Krups brand name!This blender worked great the first four times I used it. The fifth time I used it is leaked. After two more uses it simply stopped working and I had to return it.I will be purchasing a new blender made for heavier use... this worked fine when it did work, but the leaking that started made it too messy to use. (I make smoothies a few times a week. I tried to save money by settling for this, a cheaper blender, and I now realize I am going to need to put out a bit more for a heavier-duty blender.)The blender's overall design made it difficult to clean as well.I don't recommend this blender to anyone, not even at a low or clearance price. I don't know how Krup's let this blender become part of their product line."
1,Buyer Beware!,The motor burned out the second time I used the blender. It couldn't even handle two cups of lentils. Now I can't return it because it didn't burn out within 90 days. Amazon.com doesn't have a warranty policy. I guess I should have used it more when I first bought it. This is the second Krups product that has failed me within months of my purchase. I bought a Krups Toaster that burned toast on a regular basis. After about 2 months it wouldn't even do that. It just stopped working for no reason that I could see. I've had really good luck with my Krups coffee maker. But it appears that's the only product they can do right.
1,leaky blender,I thought I just got the bad blender in the lot... seems like this is just a bad product. The blender leaks! It leaks from the back all over your counter and in the cracks on the housing that are impossible to clean w/o submerging the unit (bad idea). Doesn't say much about Krups that this problem is sooo prevalent and they didnt recall. Last time for that brand!
1,Terrible blender.,Within 3 months the motor burned out. The repairshop says this is very common with this blender. Also it leaks badly. I'll never buy a Krups product again !
1,Not worth any price,I got this and after the first time I used it I thanked myself for saving the receipt and all the packaging.It leaks/sprays out the back. The plastic around the bottom is not removable - so cleaning is not thorough. Ice was not easily crushed.I am going to go for a Cuisinart or Kitchen Aid brand.
1,#$%@&*! Krups XL6 Model 344,"Optically & esthetically I always associated Krups brand with quality. Boy, wasn't I wrong!Krups XL6 Model 344 is easily the worse designed ""quality"" blender on the market. These are reasons:1) You may get one which leaks. I did, so I had to exchange it. Now I have one which just leaks much less;2) If you not bothered by note 1 above you will find out that it's impossible to clean it well because plastic bottom of the top unit is attached permanently but with a lot of inaccessible space under it.3) If you not bothered by note 1 & 2 above you will find out that it works worse than a good bargain blender (like my previous $15 one).Krups' people who approved this design should be fired!"
1,I would like to give it Zero stars,"Let me add my 2 cents worth to this horrible blender. I bought this blender based on the consumer reports review....I should have looked here first. The base leaks like crazy!! It is damned near impossible to take the blades out to clean it, then you have to struggle to get it back in. DO NOT BUY THIS BLENDER!!"
1,Piece of junk,"This has got to be the worst blender ever made. Really! 6 months old. Incredibly noisy, vibrates like crazy, and now leaks so badly thatit must be run in the sink. This blender was a new warranty replacement unit. I recieved it 6 months ago in exchange for one that had the exact same problems.Now, that it has been over a year since my original purchase, all Krups can tell me is to send it to a repair shop and pay whatever. Its not worth repairing. I suppose I can accept the business of the year limit. That said, however, I must exclaim: what stupid engineering!Krups deserves to fail if this is all the interest they have in design and quality. I bought this one because of the Krups name... never again. I am ordering an Oster today."
1,Leaky blender,Like many others on the board the blender has a design flaw in that the o-ring seal between the blade assembly and jar doesn't work. That is the cause of the leak.I wrote to Krups today hoping they could provide me with a new seal. I've only gotten to use the thing once.
3,Too many full page pictures not enough good lessons.,"This book is worth the low price but I was disappointed to find at least half of this about 60 page book is filler material-- full page black and white graphics of famous blues artists. If you're on a tight buget, this book may be a good choice."
5,Best intro blues book on the market,"I have purchase more than a dozen intro blues guitar CD books, and this one is the best on the market. Simple to follow and great samples in the back of the book. I wish Rooksby would come out with a sequel."
1,Gee..,I don't want you to buy this book. This Book will never improve your skills. Please believe me. Don't waste your money.
3,The Wizard Lord,"The Wizard Lord.The Wizard Lord by Lawrence Watt EvensI found this book to be slightly heavier then the Esthar novels, Iliked it better then them as well, probably for the vary same reason.Also, I liked the way he foreshadowed the end, it was definitelyforeshadowed, but not blatantly so. I did not like the way that he hadthe Swordsmen respond, both the first to the second to be (in thematter of the dual) and the second to the leader.( To leave a man thatwould sell his country for a little (or as in this case) a lot ofmoney loose is not my idea of patriotism (or justice).However, although I would not go so far as to recommend it, it isdefinitely a lot better then a lot of the sci-fi or fantasy novel thatyou might find."
3,"A Great World, Not so Great Characters, Not so Great Plot","This is definitely a different LWE book. Anyone who picked up this book after, say, the Esthshar series would be excused for spending a lot of time looking back at the title page wondering if this was really the same LWE.First of all, it is a fantastically complexly interesting world. Parts of it I loved, and parts I hate. Mostly I hate the fact that it gets so little explored. I mean, towns with child sacrifice just barely mentioned, and the evil that represents never dealt with?The characters seem to show slightly less fascinating, and even less dealt with. Each of them has fascinating possibilities, and few of the possibilities are brought out.The plot. Again, tensions, even great tensions, complex tensions, but not well dealt with.I would still recommend that you read this book, and I'm looking forward to the sequel. But I wish there had been more..."
2,Poor,I agree with all the other negative comments. The story and writing struck me as juvenile and boring.
2,"straight forward plot, no surprises, rather dull","""Wizard Lord"" has a simple fantasy plot: young man becomes a mystical defender of the relm, expecting this to be a cerimonial position. But their king (the Wizard Lord) is corrupt, and it's the young man's job (and the other defenders of the relm) to kill the Wizard Lord.The back cover promises plot twists, but there aren't any. Watt-Evans has written some fast paced, fun novels; but this one is slow and borring: heavy on monologs, & light on action. I was quite surprised to see it published in hardback -- the average small press publication or print-on-demand fantasy is higher quality."
2,A disappointment,"I'm a big fan of LWE's other works - most notably the Etheshar and Dragon Weather series - so I was sadly disappointed by this book. I won't get into too many specifics, as other reviewers cover them pretty well. I simply found the story very boring and slow-paced. The entire story seems to be an agonizing buildup to the highly anticipated clash with the wizard lord - a true anti-climax covered very quickly. Very unsatisfying! I also couldn't appreciate any of the characters. This is so uncharacteristic of LWE's other work whose characters normally create a great deal of empathy within the reader. I can't recommend this book and have no plans to read the rest of this series unless reviewers convince me otherwise.Update 2009: I did read the second in the series (""Ninth Talisman"") and found that to be a much more enjoyable book than this one."
3,It's okay but small keys,"If this item had cost any more then I would say it is a waste of time. At first I was sent a defective keyboard and had slow response to my email regarding the keyboard. However, they were prompt and sent me a new one and paid for the shipping of the defective one.This keyboard is okay but the keys are really small but you can get used to typing on it. The hardest part is trying to find the punctuation marks. It also makes the iPAQ awkward to hold while typing on it. It is still better than the keyboard software on the iPAQ or the Fullscreen keyboard software. I think it is a good accessory for the iPAQ. For less than $20, I would recommend you buy this product."
2,Blank software disk,"I received this item within 7 days. The software disk was blank. I had trouble finding a driver for this hardware on the companys website. After sending about 2 hours searching on the web I was finally able to find a third party drive for this hardware. But the price was cheap, so you get what you pay for."
3,"Good watch, but much tinier in person",I bought this watch for my girlfriend. She loves it! But I was a bit disappointed when receiving the watch. The picture in the item's description makes it look much bigger than it actually is.
5,Good guide for start-ups,"This book explains with real world examples, all the technical aspects of Ebusiness such as catalogues,security and payments. It also guides through the overlooked areas of integration such as legacy systems and supply chain automation.Although the chapter on Trust and Security could have been more expanded.Anyone wishes to setup an online ebusiness store should read this book to avoid the basic pitfall."
2,Recording seems to have been on low volume,"I've gotten the chance to listen to only a small portion of the CD and that was in my car. I had to turn the volume to maximum in order to be able to hear the quieter portions of the Swedish Rhapsody No. 1. I'm not talking about real pianissimo here (listen to the beginning of Rachmaninov's ""Isle of the Dead"" for some of that), just that anything shy of double forte could not be heard at normal volume settings.As a result, I am in no position to judge the performance or arrangement."
5,Comparing two Norma sets,"Recently there have been issued two live sets with Maria Callas Norma - one by Gala and one by Allegro Music labelled Opera d'oro. Both sets cast Callas and Del Monaco, and differ Simionato vs Stignani, Votto vs Serafin. And both dated by one year - 1955.Both performances are moving. Callas has better singing with Votto but with more tragic acting with Serafin. Del Monaco is too forceful with Votto and has better singing with Serafin. Simionato and Stignani both are excellent and very different as Adalgisa. To me Serafin conducting is more deep and tragic vs Votto conducting that is just dynamic."
3,Quality control problems,"The first one wouldn't work on the 45 min side. The second one worked fine. You only get 5, 10, 20, and 45 min times. I wish it were 5, 10, 15, and 20, with another version for 30, 45, 60....and maybe 90?As an easy 20min dining timer it's good. It's a little disconcerting that the alarm only sounds for a few minutes. If you don't happen to be in the room when it goes off you can end up missing the alarm. Still, better than the 5 second alarm of an egg timer."
5,Great time managment tool,"I bought it to help my daughter with time management. It works great and most importantly very easy to use. She gets an idea now on timing and will finish up the activity once the agreed time is up. And it also helps me with my time managment, too."
2,15 minute side broken after only a month.. grrrr,"It's a wonderful little gadget. If...it didn't break right away. And I've been VERY gentle with it.Ticked. I need the 15 minute side more than any other, for cleaning."
5,Great timer,My dad is very forgetful. He kept leaving the stove on but this timer sitting beside the stove has made the problem disappear. It is large enough to remind him to set the timer each time he begins to cook. It is super easy to use and he has not left the stove on once since we got it months ago!
3,Cute however,"But for my purposes it needs auto shut off and less annoying beep, etc. Or better yet an alternative to a beep like phones have. Like the way a little red light flashes on the time you set it for."
4,Works well. Easy to use.,"Just turn the 0 side up to turn it off. To time for five minutes turn the 5 side up, for 10 minutes turn the 10 up. An alarm sounds when time is up. This timer has options for 1, 5, 10, and 15 minutes."
5,Cute change from the typical timer!,"These little timers are so cute! I actually thought they were going to be smaller and would end up getting lost all the time, but, at slightly smaller than a rubicks cube, it is great."
4,Easy to use,"This timer is quick and easy to use, and works very well. The beeper is loud enough so I can hear it from a couple rooms away. I bought a couple of these with different times on them and use them when I'm cooking multiple dishes and need to set a timer quickly. It's also good for our little boy who is supposed to read 10 minutes nightly for homework. It was hard for him to set the minutes on our other timer. He just grabs this and turns it to the number of minutes he has to read. Quick and easy! It's very good for some things, but I still am keeping my other timer which can be set to any time from 1 second to 12 hours for those things that require longer or shorter timing."
4,Awesome timer,"Would have liked it to have a little more weight to it, but great product for the price. I use it as a study tool for self-teaching without cutting my lessons short :-). Batteries not included."
2,NOT LOUD,"I purchased this timer because others said it was loud. They must have been in a library.... At 3am.... By themselves.... With the timer taped to their ear. I checked it with a calibrated sound meter, it peaked 24 dB @ 2 feet! I gave 2 stars because it beeps after set time. But if you can't hear it, the timer is worthless. This maybe my first ever product returned to Amazon."
2,Not loud enough,"Datexx The Miracle Cube TimerI like the idea, and I love the design, but it's just not loud enough to be of value. Too bad, because it's really a great looking little gadget. Unfortunately, the weak electronic beeps are not loud enough or long enough to do what you need: get your attention. What a pity, but I just can't think of how I can use it, much as I'd like to. I'll keep it, though; I like its appearance that much. It could even be in a museum of commercial art. That's how I justified two stars to myself. Actually, if I rated it only for its performance as a timer, one-star would be right."
4,Nap timer,"The alarm in this nap timer is fairly loud. However, please note it will only sound for 30 seconds if you don't stop it. So a deep sleeper does need to understand this limitation."
4,cute and works.,"Just got this for my son who is having trouble staying on tasks and, frankly, could learn to hustle now and then. It's fun and works perfectly. It is made of brittle plastic so I can't imagine it holding up to much falling. That's too bad, because the size and shape are very satisfying. I little heft would be nice. Also- it has a small blinking red light when the timer is running. I wish the red light operated as a warning signal for the last minute instead. Since there is a clock window, I don't need the red light to know the timer is working. Otherwise, I am happy to have it and like the simplicity of a selection of preset times. Son feels more confident when he beats the time in homework and various tasks. Couldn't be easier for him to use."
2,Not very pleased,"I bought this for my daughter to help her get a sense of time. It works ok, though it has gone off when the O was on the top--kind of annoying. I really haven't found this helpful in that it doesn't have a countdown on each side of it. It is really hard to know how much time you have left to finish something. There is a little on on one side, but it is very hard to see and is sideways or upside down depending on which side you place it on. It really needs one on each side. I realize this would be much more expensive and more difficult to make, but without that this is not worth very much. I was thinking of getting one for my desk too, but I'm not going to bother now. It's a great concept, just, regrettably, a poor execution."
5,Better than any smartphone timer apps! Great for GTD system!,"I have a smartphone and I tried a number of apps to help me time the tasks I have in Inbox and which take little time. GTD recommends 2 min, I like 5 min. This app is great for that. Some improvements for the future edition:(1) A custom side (to input custom time like 2 min)(2) An option to turn off the red flashing - it may be distracting(3) An option to reset to the same time by the press of the button (or lifting up and putting down the timer)...The alarm beeps... my 5 min to write this review are up..."
3,Duh!,"This little timer is clever, but who is the retard who designed the timer display be upside down once we set it for 15 minutes? Can you believe it! One pushes the start button and the countdown begins. But, if we turn it to make the display readable, it starts timing again with the new time that faces up-60 minutes- instead of the time chosen originally-15 minutes. As for the other times, better not have eyesight challenges or an arthritic neck preventing you from reading the display vertically. As soon as you obvert the timer to read the display, it starts all over again but with the wrong time.... Duh."
1,Worst music ever! Really!,"It is a shame that Amazon allows such amateurs, who have no ear for music and no idea that they have no talent, to sell their music on their site. This is just atonal garbage, from a little boy that thinks radio stations owe him an apology for not playing his ""music."" I can't sugarcoat this, it just really, really, really, sucks. Not even good for a drink coaster."
1,waste of money!,Do not buy this. All his music is on 3 chords. someone bought it for me as a gift and the one song sounded like it was skipping. this guy is not talented at all!
1,Begining Of NOTHING.,This is awful. How dare you even call this music! Why do you insult other people's songs when you know yours suck! Ew...
5,"well-made receiver, good instructions","I installed this receiver/hitch in a little over an hour, despite the '15 minute' estimate found in the instructions. You have to unhook the rubber muffler hanger (difficult) in order to maneuver the receiver into place.All the hardware was included to install this part.We successfully towed a trailer across the country with our 09 Sedona without a problem, using this receiver."
4,easy,"though this is a good backup tool for hard-core coders who use notepad, if you're just trying to get a proffesional, clean, and good running website up and ready in days, not months, this is the software for you."
4,A lot of fun for one but two is a bit cozy,"Just bought this and tested it around the house. It was very easy to put together - didn't even need to read the instructions. The pros - it steers very easily compared to other trailer/strollers. The cons - if not paying attention, one of the kids could easily tip the stroller backwards by leaning on it and the other is the seats are sling seats, so when my two kids sit in there, they tend to fall to the middle of the trailer and lean on one another. There should be a more sturdy seat that allows each of the kids to sit without falling to the middle."
2,Straps Break Easily,"We bought our Schwinn Trailer in February 2005 and really enjoyed using it all Spring. Since we live in Phoenix, we stored the Trailer in our shed for the summer. When we took it out last weekend, the staps literally disintegrated in our hands when we grabbed them. Schwinn is sending us a new seat and straps, but we've got to figure out how to repair it. They will only replace parts, but not provide labor. I wouldn't recommend buying this Trailer if you live in a hot area...unless you have air-conditioned storage for your bicycle gear."
4,Masks,Interesting info on the different masks from different regions of the African continent. Also used for research in appraisal of african art.
2,Very disappointing,"This book appeared to be promising, but the photography and the variety weren't interesting at all to me. Just my opinion."
4,Great book,"I consider this a ""must"" for any serious African mask collector. The font is really small and I wish there will be more big pictures not only the small ones at the end of the book."
5,African Masks,Excellent review of many of the masks in the Barbiet-Mueller collection. Well organized and carefully done photos. Valuable addition to any collectors library.
4,Dead on!!,"This book proved very hard to put down. I would give it 4 stars as opposed to 5 only because the author strays a bit to much from giving advice while promoting himself. Either way, VERY good book. Very revealing and eye opening look at democrats and there true initiative. Also very good advice on how to become succesful."
1,Give me a Break,Just another conservative bashing book trying to prove how riches can save everyone despite the fact that all of our american greed is destroying everything in our path. This guy must of got the idea for this book after having lunch with Ann Coulter after they got finished reminiscing about their rich childhoods and how they had to spend it with all of these poor liberals around. Get rich quick or get fooled again.
4,Interesting emphasis on tax advantages,"Millionaire Republicans emphasizes some basic issues regarding tax advantages and real estate ownership that make sense. Unfortunately, he wastes too much paper on bashing Democrats. The issues would have been more seriously considered had they not been presented in the context of a partisan battle."
5,Best book on success and making money I've ever read!,"I was worried this book would be all about politics, but it wasn't. I have read many books on positive thinking and how to make money, but none of them have ever taught me as much as Millionaire Republican has. This book teaches us how we can actually succeed and make money in the real world. It should be taught in schools, our children need to learn these valuable life skills.I wish this book had been around when I was twenty years old! I give this the best possible rating. I would recomend it to anyone and everyone!"
4,Very Good,"I recommend this book to anyone that is dissatisfied with the status quo of working for someone else vs. having your own business. Wayne writes very well, and he is able to communicate his points brillantly. You will never regret purchasing this book."
1,Waste of time,"The author rambles and takes too long to get to the point and when he does, then the point is general and vague. Who does not know it is better to own then to rent or that a strong work ethic and determination in the face of failure are needed to succeed? This is hardly a republican discovery. If you want to hear how wonderful Wayne Root is, he will be happy to tell you in this book. If you want to hear some bashing on liberal Democrats, you will find that here too (zzzz). The author tells you what you already know or has already been documented elsewhere, then attempts to say all of these amazing notions are the result of a republican philosophy. There are far better sources for clear and specific financial advice as well as better uses for your time."
2,huh?,"cannot understand this book.....have known Mr Root for over 30 years....hardly born to rags...lived in upper scale section of mt vernon, ny went to exclusive private school.....not a rags to riches book...more like a born to money and made more money book....hardly would put him in the same class as Jimmy the Greek Snyder.....Jimmy spent many years at CBS Sports paired with Brent Musberger....Mr Root has spent most of his time on marginal cable channels...most with small audiences and in some case he had to buy the cable air time himself to get his programs on the air....this is another book where mr root will make money telling you how to make money....better off playing the weekly lotto!"
1,Rich Republicans Get Rich - By Breaking and Buying the Law,"Rich Republicans are NOT bold, daring risk-takers. If anything, Rich Republicans are risk-averse cowards devoted to protecting their possessions - and the much-vaunted ""ownership Society"" is all about violating the principles of capitalism to force more and more market risk onto the backs of the working poor and to insulate Rich Republicans (the ""Leisure Class"") from ever experiencing true financial ""risk"".Furthermore, Rich Republicans do NOT seek to maintain a market atmosphere of ""competition"" - competition being anathema to Rich Republicans. No, Rich Republicans prefer to ""game"" the market, and they spend vast sums of other people's money and engage in violence to destroy their competition through buy-outs, frivolous lawsuits, intimidation, harassment and illegal wars.This book is yet another among the many that intentionally mislead ignorant, conservative Americans about the true agenda of Rich Republicans."
5,Perfect book if your starting your Live in Spain research,"I just decided to look into moving to Spain and being green behind the ears this was the perfect book for my stage of research. Some ""living in spain"" books might be more detailed or specific, but Weinstein's book was written as if the author and I were sitting across the table at a Starbucks. She gave a general introduction to the highlights of not only history and culture but of the region and what locations will fit ""me"". A very easy and motivating read. If your still wondering if you want to make the move or where to go, this is your book."
1,fell apart :(,given what we paid for this I was really upset. The mesh on one whole side ripped out. There was no reason for this to happen. It was not abused. Or misused. It was used ONLY when we where on vacation at my Dad's. My 19mo son slept in it for nap and bedtime.I would not suggest this to anyone.
2,"Nice, but not literally effective","While reading the novel, Summer of the Swans, my students were totally immersed in the characters, the action, the humor and the suspense. In order do well on a test, I purchased the DVD After School Specials, which contained what I thought was a video of the novel. Unfortunately, the show was quite different from the novel. Many of my students were disappointed in the characters portrayed in the show. In the novel, Charlie is learning disabled and does not speak. In the show, Charlie appeared as a normal elementary age child. This essentially took away a lot of the suspense from the storyline. Needless to say, the show was short, about one hour long, so a lot had to be cut from the novel. Again, my students were disappointed that certain events did not take place. Essentially, the show did not help in reviewing for the test over the novel. It was a nice show, but I would not recommend it if you want to review the novel."
4,Afterschool DVD,"Wished they put on DVD the PBS shows, Bread & Buterflies, Inside Out and Self, Inc.! Watched them in school!"
5,A simple yet deep and very helpful explanation of fear,"Jane Aaron's book is terrific! Matisse-style cutout pictures of mothers, fathers, and children are bold, beautiful, and deceptively simple, allowing children of all races to relate to this subtle description of fear and its antidotes. I'm so impressed by this book, and by the three others in the series!"
3,for my scaredy girl!,"A fun book that fit perfect for my Granddaughter who is afraid of EVERYTHING. It doesnt make light of her fears, but is light-hearted."
5,does exactly what it's supposed to,"I was so sick of my old kettle: handle too hot to hold, slow to boil, leaky spout - you know the drill. So, I decided to go for a quality brand and pay a little extra. The conclusion? This Krups is worth every penny. It doesn't leak, there are no dangling cords and it boils in a jiffy. And better yet - it even looks good on the counter top.A great product and thoroughly recommended."
4,"Excellent, but not perfect","The good things:heats quicklyperforms flawlesslycovered elementscool bottomvery stable.The bad things:large footprint: takes up a lot of space on my deskwater level indicator only accurate if the kettle is held absolutely levelBecause of the width of the kettle and size of the top, difficult to ill from the water cooler (I fill via the spout)."
4,Forget the comparison to The Stand.,"I thoroughly enjoyed this tautly written little novel. No, it's not The Stand but, then again, one was enough. (Oh, that's right, King found it necessary to re-release The Stand with an additional 400 pages added to an already too long book!) Anyway, this story dealt with the day to day life of a small group of people who have managed to survive in a world gone mad, literally. Something had occurred that caused most of the population to go insane. Sometimes, while watching the news, I think that may already have happened to the real world."
3,good story ... too much a Stephen King clone though,"Not a bad story and a good, fast little read. We follow the day to day life of a small town in a post-apocolyptic world as our hero tries to maintain law and order in an increasingly savage world. Each chapter is highlighted by original illustrations by Jim Starlin, some of which are quite good. Unfortunately, for any who have read Stephen King's The Stand, this book can come across as a refresher course. Stralin and Graziunas' writing is tight though, and their characters have a real quality to them. I just can't get over the comparisons to the Stand enought to give it a stronger grade"
3,First 2 Thirds Was Interesting,The first 2 thirds was very interesting. She describes the life style and culture of the Ladakh and then how the culture of the people and individuals are affected by modernization and development attempts by the Indian government. The last third was her opinions about how developement and globalization is affecting the world. I already knew most of this information. Also she offered solutions but I was also familiar with those. This part was out of date.
1,Helena Norberg-Hodge,"If ""tourism"" and increased interest from the West is what caused all of these problems, then why did she write this book?It will only line her pockets; but her book will bring increased scrutiny of and interest in the Ladakh, and they have clearly been harmed by such attention."
4,Greed,"I bought this book and started reading it while staying in Ladakh for three weeks, two years ago. The place was still amazing, but unfortunately the destruction process was in full swing. What the author says is pure common sense and her worst predictions have become real. It is a shame how we can spoil not only the environment, but also the soul and the way of life of an ancient culture. The second half of the book is not pleasant to read, but anyway, it is revealing. This is how greed (ambition they call it?) works.Highly informative and recommendable.By the way, do not miss the editorial review by Mr. Donald Clay Johnson at the top of the Amazon's reviews section of the page. I found it really ... amusing"
4,One of my favorites of the year.,"Always one of my favorite dvds of the year. This one featured a strong main event, and a good show that is different and more extreme than others."
5,My son loves it.,"My son is a big WWE fan and loves this dvd. He got it yesterday for Christmas and wanted to watch it right away. I'm not a fan of wrestling, but he said this dvd is great and said he would giv eit 5 stars."
2,Its ok just wasnt what i thought it would be,OK we first got the disc it said that they included a private interview with christain it didnt show that! it was a good thing to watch just one match was skipped Layla vs Michell Mikcool but it was ok
3,"Some useful advice, but too many anecdotes","Some of Johnson's advice seems very helpful - particularly the parts on determining what your goals are for your career and becoming a ""driver"" to meet those goals. She also has advice on blending into your workforce environment or making the conscious choice not to do so. However, a large portion of this book is devoted to stories of her own or her friends' struggles in the workplace, which were interesting but not really helpful to me.This book lost a star as well for me because of the poor quality of the paper and binding. The cover is extremely flimsy and the paper is very thin. My copy has already lost its square shape. I realize that this is a problem with most paperbacks nowadays, but I expect a little higher quality in a book that retails at $14.95."
4,Great german progressive Hip-Hop,"Phase V and Aleksey, the lead artist of Phase V created already in 1995 an excellent album, which is still impressive today.Hard beats and strong lyrics are key features of this album.If you like progressive Hip Hop, don't wait to hear this album."
4,Good but not fantastic phone,"Pros:Good solid phone, handsets have decent heft. Sound quality is good.The ""announced"" caller ID takes a bit to get used to but is pretty handy once you do.The menu navigation is pretty easy to understand.Doesn't seem to interfere with my wireless network at all.A few complaints but none are killers:1. The LCD screen on the phone is too dim and the backlight doesn't stay on long enough.2. When scrolling through the recent call list, the phone numbers are not displayed. The caller ID info is displayed but often it's just generic info and the phone number would really help. Hitting SELECT displays the number but that doesn't help when just searching the list.3. My old 900 MHz had better range. I have no problems anywhere in the house and I can even go about 25 feet outside my house so the range isn't bad. Just that my old phone let my go a good 100 feet away from the house."
3,Nice but not with a headset,"For the most part a very good phone. The talking caller ID is handy, as is the speaker phone capability in each handset. However, if you plan to use it with a headset you won't be happy. The microphone volume is so weak that you can't be heard when using a headset. There's a headset jack in the handset, but for all practical purposes this phone is not useable with a headset."
5,great..for a cordless phone,"The voice ID doesn't pronounce everything correctly. It is better than jumping up to look who's calling. I bought several of these ""talking phones"" for gifts and everyone loves them."
3,pound button?,"When i try to check my messages on my cell phone, im stuck, because i cant press the pound button to enter my password. Has anyone heard of attention to detail? This is the only thing wrong with the phone otherwise."
5,My mom loved it!!,"My mom has worn the same old ""dress"" watch forever. So this year for Mother's Day, I bought her this watch. She loved it. It is so delicate and elegant. I'm really glad I bought it for her. It is really pretty."
5,42nd Street - A Must Hear CD!!!!,"42nd Street, I must say, was the best Broadway musical I've ever seen. The costumes were wonderful, the dancing was magnificent, and the singing was un-believeble! After seeing the play which I am still talking about, and I can't stop thinking about, I automatically went out and bought the CD. Now I can't stop listening to it! Even the singing on the CD was magnificent! If I can you one piece of advice, it would be to buy this CD, and you we feel like dancing and singing the whole day through, with a smile on your face! And (Go see the Show!)"
5,Next best thing to Broadway,"If you can't be on 42nd Street on Broadway and see (feel, participate!) in this great classic, listening to the CD is the next best thing. No wonder the revival came after only 9 years; the tunes and taps were sorely missed. Its great to hear them again!"
2,The real life Peggy Sawyer,"Going to see the production of 42nd St is far superior to this bland attempt at capturing it. I had the pleasure to see a newcomer Meredith Patterson, the understudy for Levering, be thrown on in the starring role at the last minute on Friday night. After hearing her powerful, exciting, clear and beautiful voice sing the title song its hard to come home and have anything but dissapointment when listening to the recording. After seeing the show I'm sad to see someone so talented and far superior... as just a replacement. Maybe the producers will think about capturing her voice in a live recording? Patterson is destined to be the next big thing. I feel this CD hardly portrays the live show. It is over produced and lack luster at times. Mr. Cumpsty is a superior actor, but Jerry Orbach is truely missed."
4,"Not the greatest, but good.","Out of the many soundtracks I own, I can't say 42nd street is my favourite. However, it gets a listen every now and then. The length of it isn't so much a problem [I can listen to the 2001 The Producers and restrain from growing tired], there are a few songs I don't care for. Not to mention, some I blatantly skip over. However, ""You're Getting To Be a Habit with Me"", ""Only Have Eyes For You"", ""Lullaby of Broadway"", ""A Quarter to Nine"", and ""42nd Street"" are all excellent, and worh the 20 bucks. The beginning of the sdtk isn't the most enthralling show tunes I've heard, but the latter half makes up for it. If you're aim is to work towards completing your broadway collection, by all means, get this album! But if you're not much of a fan of musicals, there are better. 3.5 stars."
2,New Recording Holds a Dim Candle to the Original,"Before listening to this album I already had a rosy picture of the flashy new revival version of one of my most sentimental favorites. When I did a production of ""42nd st"" it was one of the best experiences I've ever had. With great anticipation I waited for the sounds of over 40 pairs of feet tapping out the rythyms of the opening number. My joy was more than dashed when it sounded like two people tapping lightly on a tin roof! Besides that, old orchestrations are not made better, but worse! Except in the case of ""Dames- Keep Young and Beautiful"" which was the splendid point of the recording. There are better song selections in this new version, but they are put together poorly. And even someone who never tapped in their lives could tell that the tap sounds were dangerously off the beat in more than one number. If you want to hear 42nd st at it's best, buy the original."
4,Oldie but goodie,"In 1980 ""42nd Street"" opened in New York to rave reviews. In 2001 a revival of the original 1933 musical again took broadway by storm. Harry Warren's and Al Dubin's songs have become part of Broadway and film musical legend. This revival adds its own life. The hoaky story is fun and lets us listen to ""You're Getting to be a Habit with Me"", ""Shuffle Off to Buffalo,"" We're in the Money,"" and ""42nd Street."" A favorite is ""Dames,"" which reminds one of South Pacific."
5,Love the Old Favorites,"It's great to hear some of these old favorite songs again, and as we are planning a trip this weekend to see 42nd St. on Broadway, it was amazing to receive the CD, and learn all of the songs before attending the performance. The vocals are classics and the CD couldn't be better. Can't wait to see how it compares with the live performance!!"
2,stirrers,i was disappointed in these...they are to short. Next time i order i will be sure to check the length first.
4,Grandson loves it!,"I purchased this tent for my grandson for a Christmas gift. I am very pleased with the tent it has extras like zippers on the doors. The only thing I am not happy with is the quality of the velcro which is used to secure the tent to the poles, none of them really stay attached no matter how you try to rap them around the poles. Had to use string to keep them secure. That is my only complaint."
5,Excellent indoor/outdoor outer space adventure!,"This tent is awesome not only because of its outer space theme, but also because you can set it up inside or outside. There is lots of ventilation throughout and lots of openings. The netting at the top allows you to look up and see the stars at night.It is high enough so adults can sit up inside to play with their children.My only wish is that it were longer so taller folks could sleep laying down straight, but my 5 and 3 year olds have plenty of room to stretch out and sleep under the stars.We will bring this tent up to their bedroom in cold weather for year round adventures! They love to use it for play or for a secret hide out or for reading. I Highly recommend it!"
5,Out-of-this-world Play Tent,"My son received this as a gift for his second Christmas since his bedroom was done in an outer pace theme. It has been set up in the playroom ever since (3 years later). My son and daughter LOVE to play inside, pretending to fly to other planets or making believe they are camping in the forest. There are lots of doors to get in and out and the mesh top keeps it from being too dark or closed in. We even have a few play tunnels that fit into the side openings, creating a space station. The bottom is a vinyl/tarp-like material, so I assume it could be used outside, but we've always kept it indoors (we added a large floor cushion and some pillows for comfort). It is very easy to set up (just like a pop up tent), light and very durable. I would highly recommend."
4,Bigger than other tents,"This tent was purchased for a preschool classroom set-up (the theme was ""space"")and I was pleased with the size. Children liked it and played nicely there. It was used for one week only, but it looks to be sturdy and well done.It is bigger than other ones, the graphics are neat and it has openings in all the sides, which is very convenient.In general, I think it is a good product, especially if you have more than one child using it at the same time."
2,"interesting stuff, needs editing","I bought this book following a very interesting review in the NY Review of Books, but I found it something of a disappointment. It seems to me heavy on genes, and somewhat lighter on people and language, so I would not recommend it unless one is interested in the science involved. I also found a persistent mismatch in the amount of explanation given. Some concepts are explained redundantly throughout the book, but other explanations are, in my view, too brief or unclear. I also didn't care for the chatty digressions in some spots, like the introduction to the Chapter 5. The story this author has to tell is a fascinating one, but he hasn't written a very readable book, at least for the layman."
2,No original thought here,"While Genes, Peoples and Languages is written in appealing,informal narrative, the engaging chatter fails to disguise that there isn't much original thought here. The information he's dealing with is exciting and ought to provoke speculation and new directions of thought, but the author contents himself with forcing the findings into the same old nineteenth century doctrine we've been laboring with all along. He tells us about the astounding genetic similarities between all peoples,but barely wonders how current thinking, which he reviews, on human evolution and global expansion can be reconciled with the new genetics. I've been hoping for someone to ask, given these findings, Who really are we? What was our past? Genes, Peoples and Languages isn't that book."
3,Panasonic losing their edge,I purchased the phone to replace the Panasonic that I had for about 4 years. The older phone was rich in functionality and performed outstandingly well.NOT this phone. Many of the features are either missing or buried under two or three layers of menus. It does not even have a find handset option on it's front which is key to today's portable home phones.
1,Outraged at uselessness,"I don't usually write reviews.The phone doesn't automatically work when I plug it in. Dials OK. But doesn't respond to a ring.I returned it to Amazon. Second unit (replacement, received today) is just like the first.This is really outrageous. (Other phones plugged into same jack ring fine. Unit is powered up. Battery is charged. Base unit ring volume set high. Same for handheld unit. Phone does not respond to incoming calls in any way -- no flashing light, no answering machine pickup, no ring. Phone makes outgoing calls fine. When I dial the phone's number from the phone itself, phone network indicates busy.)I am now waiting for a response from Panasonic technical support."
5,The BEST!,"This is one of the most value books extant. I have delved a great deal into issues of increased intelligence, etc., and this book is one of the best values around. It covers not only self-analysis but also self-improvement. It's notes on memory and speed-reading echoe the main points in a program costing 20 times as much. I heartily recommend this book to anyone interested in increasing your intellect."
5,That's what they call it a Book,"I find this book excellent, it made mirecales with me, it is difficult to specify the fields in which it explore's your hidden powers, I highly recomend this book to everybody who's interested in developing their skills and talents"
4,interesting list of ideas,"This is a compilation of ideas from personal experience, and many of them I wish I had thought of back when I was in college."
4,PT Cruiser Limited Edition SP Women's Bicycle,"It's a great bike. In my own opinion, only one thing kept it from getting a 5 star rating; the bumpers are a bit thin & easily moved back & forth. They could be a bit stronger. Other than that, it's a great bike !! The best review, however, goes to Amazon itself. I sought out this Limited Edition SP Women's bike after it had been out awhile and was next to impossible to find on the numerous sites I checked out. Amazon had it, and it arrived almost 3 weeks ahead of it's scheduled delivery timeframe. It's not the only thing I've ordered from Amazon, and I couldn't be happier with the speedy & smooth transactions. Thank you Amazon."
2,Somewhat disappointed,"If you are buying this CD because you are a Wolfman fan, please note that he only appears in two short clips (before track 1 and after the last track). If you are buying this because you like instrumentals, please note that only Tracks 1 and 2 are originals; the rest are recent recordings but by the original artists. This isn't to say the CD is not worth buying but it's not quite what I had in mind."
3,A disappointing travel guide,This series was not as informative as I would expect from footprint handbooks. I provided very limited information about excursions.
1,"Worked great, then the leaks started. unsafe.","Like many other users of this product, we have issues with leaks. The ""volume gauge"" randomly unseats from its housing, slowly leaking boiling water all over the kitchen counter. While this has not yet caused any electrical mishaps, this is clearly not safe.We can (and have) reseated the gauge and used the kettle. However, we're unlikely to purchase anything from Krups again. Engineering a leak-free kettle is hardly an impossible problem; we might as well buy from a manufacturer with a higher standard of care."
2,It was a great little kettle until one day....,"I loved this little guy --- Boiled water in a couple minutes... Then one day, after about 9 months, just like everyone else the rubber stopper at the bottom of the water level view port fell out - and is nowhere to be found! I think the dog ate it. Well now it is a $45 paper weight. Finally threw it away after today spending a couple of hours trying to locate a replacement part online. Don't waste you time."
2,Boiling Water is One of Life's Essential Activities,"I first purchased an electric kettle for my aged mother. One day she absent-mindedly left her tea kettle boiling away on the stove (it became part of the stove). Now if she forgets about the kettle, there isn't any danger of the house burning down as these kettles automatically turn off after the water boils. Which brings me to my gripe with this kettle. The base is so light weight and unstable that it can easily move around when one tries to replace the kettle. The last thing you want is an unstable surface and a kettle full of boiling water. The Braun model is much sturdier, with a firm base, but it is very large."
1,Horrible piece of Krups,"Got this abomination for X-mas as a present. It worked for a couple weeks quite nicely, and then boiling water started leaking from the bottom. As one of the previous reviewers noted, the tubing in the measuring chamber comes off, particularly when the water is hot. Krups' advice? Push it back in. Right. And the puddle of boiling hot water hopefully won't hurt anyone in the house every time this kettle leaks. Waiting for the official recall to return this thing. Or maybe a class action suit. Do not buy, this appliance is dangerous!"
1,poorly designed,"I bought one, and it lasted less than a year before it started leaking. Also the auto shut-off feature, when empty, didn't work, which could create potential fire hazard."
4,This Kettle Has Been Kind To Me,"I have owned this kettle for at least two years. It has been perfect for my needs. Yes the little plug came out of the water window a couple times, but it was not a big problem since I just put it back. It has not come out since. Searching the market now, there appears to be no other small kettle with a comfortable grip as this one on the market today. I think it boils water faster than others available now as well. I bought a second one as a back up and plan to buy another for a gift."
1,Frustrating,"I purchased these pliers at a local store to close J clips for assembling a rabbit hutch. The pliers worked well at first. After about 6 clips, the ends bent away from each other and they would no longer close the clips. To get the hutch finished ""enough"" I had to use a hammer to straighten the plier ends before each clip and finish the clip with a pair of regular pliers. Annoying.Needless to say, they are going back to the store and I'm searching for a pair of pliers that will hold up long enough to finish the hutch.I'd avoid this brand if I were you."
1,picture and description are different pliers,the picture clearly shows pliers of the Pet Lodge brand Manufactured by Miller Manufacturing where as the description is for little giant pliers I wonder which one you will get and which is being reviewed.
4,J-clips Plier,This plier is for the hobbyist only. Not recommended for the serious enthusiast. Plier itself is too short to my palm. I rather buy the more expensive one. Well it's worth for what you buy for.
3,Wire Clip Pliers,"Again....didn't need these as we didn't use the clips. I suppose if you use the clips they might work, but we found them difficult to use."
4,Lovely!,"This is both larger and lovelier than I was expecting from the picture. It hangs more than 2 1/2 feet long (32 inches from top hook to bottom crystal), which is much larger than I thought. Because of the design, all but the most ferocious winds go through it, so its tone is always light tinkling rather than deafening clamor. Makes a very pleasant addition to a sunny west-facing window in my house."
4,Read before you attempt,"This book is a very down to earth and well written aid forthe pre-adoptive parent. Read all you can on this subjectbefore you adopt a child with reactive attachment, thisbook is a positive, uplifting help. It is easy to readand understand and is a useful tool for the pre-adoptiveparent."
5,Great book!,First book I am reading about attachment issue and this is really helpful. Step by step how to make up the attachment cycle. As manu parents I am taking everything very serious but this book help keep 'Take it easy' level.
3,Read this first,"Being slightly famillar with a older versiion of Paint Shop I felt I still needed the basic instructions that Dummies gives.I was not disappointed. I am also using ""Paint Shop Pro 9 Photographers Guide"" and with the two I am becoming well on my way to a Pro at Paint Shop Pro"
5,Great memory upgrade for my Dell 4600,"This is truly an excellent memory upgrade. My Dell Dimension 4600 had 512 MB of PC2700 RAM before, and now has 2 GB of PC3200 RAM. My computer definitely performs better, faster, and quieter. Highly recommend this memory upgrade and Crucial as a seller. Great product. Thank you."
2,Packs of 00006 is Ambiguous,"This suggests that you can get 6 of them in the title of this item. If so it is a great deal, but I won't trust it so will buy it from another elsewhere."
2,Jimmy The Gent (Remaster),"We really like James Cagney movies, however, this one is ridiculously stupid with very few laughs in between horrible dialog and a bad Cagney haircut."
3,Diving Mask,"The mask and purge valve worked fine, but the strap broke on both masks I bought within 2 days of use. Had to replace with silicone straps. Good for one season I suspect and snorkling only."
4,Nicely done educational drama for the kids of the 70's,Here is the sad truth about the video quality. It's not due to bad DVD mastering. These shows were filmed on film but then they were post produced and edited on videotape(Videotronics was the company). Videotape of the 1970's. You get the idea. The best broadcast quality videotape of yesteryear is no match for DVD quality of today (as fans of the classic Norman Lear videotaped sitcoms have found out).Add to that the deterioration that the master tapes have experienced then it all adds up to that we are seeing it as good as it's ever going to get (unless someone digs up the original film and edit that together).the packaging is truly inspired and remarkable and the quality concerns were unavoidable.
1,Very Disappointing,"It's such a great idea to release these shows on DVD and the packaging for these two volumes is really inventive. However, great packaging doesn't make a great DVD. The quality of the shows on these DVDs is bottom of the barrel. I am actually surprised they had the gall to release these. Literally, the picture quality of ""The Pinballs"" episode is, and I am not exaggerating here, the same as a third generation VHS cassette as if the show were taped off of broadcast television. Without the benefit of cable.The extras are actually worse. The extras consist of still frames from the shows that have been blown up to fill the screen. The images are completely blown out and pixelated. I would have preferred no ""extras"" than something this bad.I don't know if it is a blessing that these shows are available at all or if it is just plain insulting that this company is asking people to pay for these horrible reproductions. Overall I think this DVD is an embarrassment. What a shame."
4,Tony can't really pinpoint those lows,I didn't particularly like the solo done by Tony on the track Hawaiian Wedding song. Tony just couldn't cut the lows cleanly enough.
4,Works as advertised,"It's a cheap way to add a decent DB-9 female connector to open serial wires. This product allows you to arrange the wires however you see fit as well, which is nice. It is made of cheap plastic, but I didn't have any issues opening the case and closing it several times. Overall I am happy purchasing this as an inexpensive DB-9 connector for a microcontroller project I was working on."
2,Not Bad - Not Great,"Roadside Picnic (1977) by Arkady Strugatsky - 145 pages - rating: 5.5/10The idea of a zone of dangerous and mysterious alien trash carelessly left behind on earth is brilliant. Unfortunately Arkady is not a writer with sufficient skill to capitalize on this theme. He does'nt write in a fashion that is interesting or captivating. He seems more interested in advancing his political views.The political and social commmentary rambles on and on in a way that is tiresome. Does a common theif have more rights than an honest man because he has had a "" tough life "" ? No , I dont think so.If you are interested in the plight of people subsisting within an oppressive political regime and the alcohol abusers and black market theives it seems to create why not read some non fictional works on the subject. But as far as intriguing and stimulating science fiction is concerned you should read something by Frederick Pohl, Greg Bear or Fred Hoyle.Claus Kellermann - GeoPhysicist[...]"
3,Shades of the not-so-innocent,"The current job atmosphere in this ""Post-Enron"" era and the critical shortage of organ donors both play a major role in Kurt Koss's ""Shades of Innocence"". His protagonist is a typical, out-of-work, middle-aged man, who, desperate to make money, becomes an unwilling accessory to murder. Though at times slowed by the realistic details of computer hacking and information exchange, the reader is pulled along by the question as to how this ordinary, non-violent business man can escape the entangled web designed by adept and ruthless assassins."
2,attack on rats,"This is an obvious attack on rats. If you notice the funding for the book, it's from big exterminator companies who want to make people fear rats. Rats get a bad rap, they're blamed for starting the plague (it was actually fleas), are thought of as dirty, repugnant, hoarding creatures and are hunted for their fur. I'm no big fan of rats but I met a guy in Russia who loved and studied them (unfortunately he was bitten by a rabid one and died of fever later). He taught me that rats are just animals in the diverse natural world. He lived with thousands of them and they were very lovable. Of course he wasn't the best smelling guy. He even gave me an albino rat, who later was crushed in my bag when it was mishandled on the train.Books like this are not doing rats any favors so please keep an open mind and a big piece of cheese for them."
1,Sad Book.,"I got this book as a gag gift for my mother, since we have pet rats, after reading it, I was shocked.This book portrays rats as these horrible creatures, when in fact they are not. Yes, they make a mess, just like any other animal, but they are doing what they need to do to survive.Rats just do not come out of the blue and attack people. You have to disturb them.I mean seriously?I've had pet rats for many years and I've never been attacked, my house isn't dirty, it is not filled with disease, and it doesn't even stink.I would not recommend this book to somebody to ""gain knowledge"" over rats.Like an earlier review said, it is a bias book and if you want to learn more information on rats, Google would be a better source this then book.And if you don't want to be ""attacked"" don't mess with wild rats.End of story."
5,Go Wireless,"I purchased these for my [...] beacuse her 2 year brother kept pulling the wires when she was trying to play with traditional controllers. She loves them and they can really take a beating, the have been dropped, stepped on and tossed. They have great range and work great!"
3,Great electronics - bad fit,"This controller is a great wireless controller if your hands don't fit the regular wired PS2 controller. I purchased this controller for some range since I have a 42 inch LCD HDTV (I sit far away). The buttons are a bit cheap, the joysticks are a joke (but I am a serious gamer) and the darn thing just did not fit my hand correctly. The area where the batteries go in (directly underneath between the control pad and shape buttons) is quite thick and made my middle finger and ring finger hurt. The shape and overall feel is not that great. The receiver is the best part!!! Most PS2 wireless controllers have HUGE receivers that stick out funny - this one is compact and looks sleek. Battery life is average for a wireless, nothing special. Range would be tough to exceed. Overall, this controller is average."
2,Fair,"Not what I was expecting, was looking for a real old fashion show that Wolfman Jack did in his day."
4,A Handsome Terrarium,Packing is remarkable. This is a heavy item but ships complete with safety glass; all parts intact; although Fedex does their best to demolish the carton.This is a Victorian style piece that looks and functions well in my sunroom. Price was OK especially with free ship. If you love indoor gardening this piece is recommended. Plastic liner tray will keep moisture off your floor. The legs could be a bit sturdier and align more squarely but this is a minor issue.
4,Good,Been using these for pratice. They are just the right weight to throw.Great for anyone!Judy Reppart
4,CDG's to begin your collection.,"I bought this pack of Sweet Georgia Brown's CDG's after my collection of CDG's was stolen. It has a nice mix of songs that helped me to keep my business running, and was the first step in attempting to replace my last 9 years of lost cdg purchases.This pack of CDG's is a great investment for a beginning DJ."
4,Very nice skillet but ...,"This skillet is excellent when it is new. The temperature seems constant, and the capacity is great. However, with age (mine is now about 4 years old), the temperature is inconsistent and the non-stick coating is seperating from the bottom of the pan.We have always hand washed the skillet, using a dish cloth or sponge, and despite special care with utensils etc., the pan is now unusable because of the flaking teflon.The manufacturer claims this is a result of harsh detergents, and somehow I don't think Joy dish soap falls in that category.Again, great when new, ages poorly."
1,"I loved it at first, but now that I know it better . . .","THis seemed like such a great pan- big, cooked fast, etc. I cleaned it very carefully, but the non-stick coating came off in places. The diamond shaped grid in the bottom trapped food and burned it, and the temperature levels are not steady the element is either on full or off, alternately cooling and boiling what it should be simmering.After I serve tonight's burnt dinner, I'm throwing this skillet away."
1,cheaply made,"Looks good online, not so much in person. Mine came broken, I'm sure I can glue it but why should I have to? VERY flimsy plastic base (which is why mine came broken). Needs to be mounted, which is kind of a lot of work for a tissue box dispenser. And even though it says green in the description, I wasn't expecting it to be THAT green. Looks more like Herman Munster than an Easter Island statue. In the picture it looks grey/green."
5,Great for a few laughs,I too have this great tissue holder and I solved the problem of it being upright by wedging it between several books on a book shelf in our family room. It works great!
4,Be upstanding,"My solution to the problem of placing the box upright:1) Get a plain old stamped metal bookend (basically a piece of thin steel bent at a right angle, causing a kind of ""tongue"" to extend on one side). Mine is about 4.5"" wide and 4.5"" high.2) Place tongue piece between bottom of tissue box and inside bottom of Tiki holder.3) Set upright. Stand back. Admire.4. For greater stability, place a can on the part of the bookend that extends out from behind the holder. I'm using Steen's Sugar Syrup, but I imagine canned spinach will work as well. Exercise your creatvity."
2,Tiki Head Tissue Box Cover - Not,"I ordered this for my husband because I had purchased a similar item for my son and he liked it...This particular one was disappointing due to the fact that we have yet to find a tissue box to actually fit the cover.Needless to say, it's sitting on a shelf gathering dust."
5,Great conversation piece,Such a clever twist to providing something pretty mundane--tissues. Have had lots of laughs and the tissues come out just as illustrated--way better than the last tissue box cover had.
2,Disappointed,Very unique but mine came broken. We super glued it because my daughter liked it so well but not well made :(
4,Love this!,This was the perfect addition to my office. The only downfall is that it tips over when you pull the tissues out. You have to put your hand on the top to brace it. Other than that it was worth it...big hit!
1,Color not right,"This item came from Target and was more bright mossy green than brown. I sent it back as defective (stating that some of the foam had been missing from his nose, which is also true) and got a full refund, including shipping. There may be other companies that produce a higher quality version of this item."
1,the first time I've been mad enough to write a negative product review,"A few years ago I bought a real Tiki Head Tissue Box Cover from some catalog for a young nephew, who Loved it. So I tried to get another for another nephew. This one is made of a cheap material and doesn't cover the tissue box. Just sits on top. Worse, this was part of a large order on amazon, and I didn't realize it was coming from an outside vendor, UMA urban materials + accessories, who charged me over $12 for shipping!"
4,Great Book!,My child received this book at the age of one and it was an instant favorite. It was not long before my child was imitating some of the animal sounds. The giant flaps were easy for my child to open. I only gave it four stars since the book did not hold up to the constant use (some of the flaps eventually fell off).
2,"Kinda weird, and kinda stupid, but entertaining.","Coquettish has released a very strange and crazy CD of poor Japanese punk rock. It's quite pointless, and it's very strange, and you will have a very difficult time understanding words, but it's entertaining."
5,stops car,"No more worry about garage closing on car or crashing into freezer. It sticks to floor wonderfully, stops the car when we come in at a slow roll and is so brightly colored Im not worried about tripping over it."
3,Not made for SUVs,"The great reviews convinced me to buy these. Sticks very well to the cement floor. Looks real good too. But it is a bit too small for large tires although some reviews said it was fine. Try it, maybe your SUV will feel the stop but my Lexus 350 doesn't very well."
3,Camco AccuPark,Item was of okay quality. definitely not my best purchase on Amazon and would not buy again. It's a cheap solution to help with parking your car in the garage with a sticky side on one end. It's hard to expect a piece of plastic to stay in place when a 3500 ib vehicle is bumping up against it.
4,Good parking assist,"Lets me know when the car is in garage far enough. What more can I say about this, but that it works"
4,I like it,"Did what I expected. If it was a little bit larger that would work better with my truck, but overall happy. Just make sure you drive slow as you bump your tire into it."
1,This game sucks!!!,"Do not wast your money. the game is terrible, it looks really cool on the box but it isn't."
2,Butler Tray Hinges,"I ordered 6 of these late last year and two more recently. In both orders I noticed that they weren't identical in size and shape. Some halves were not aligned to the mating half causing a ""bent"" appearance. They claimed to use #5 screws but it seemed that size sat too deep into the countersink. The second order had even deeper countersinks for the screws!These are expensive and should have better machining. Nowhere in the listing is it mentioned that these are ""Made in China""!"
2,Scratchy at best,"This would have been my fourth Panasonic phone, it was meant to replace the oldest of the bunch in the livingroom, since it has issues now stemming from age and use. But.... This phone wouldn't work right anywhere in the house. When the Voice Enhancement is on it is like shouting into a barrel, and with it's off it's more like shouting into a large pail, better, but far from acceptable. Hearing the person on the other end is a bit odd and tinny, but no way no how can I adapt to the reverb on this sucker."
3,short battery life???,"there are a few things i don't like about this phone. the first is that if it is off the base for any amount of time, when it is replaced it signals that the battery needs recharging and the battery light is yellow. makes me wonder how long it will last off the base. also, the speaker phone, which was touted as clear and powerful, isn't either. i wanted a better phone than i had, but this one wasn't it despite the extra MHz's"
4,Cool phone which is easy to use...,"This phone is extremely simple to set-up and add additional handsets to. The handsets do not require connections to phone jacks themselves as they work of the base unit. The phone has a neat feature which allows to record songs as rings to several different numbers in your phone book. Not those dorky fake songs that come with cell phones either, honest to goodness songs you can record right from your iTunes or stereo. The phone address book is easy to add to direct from the caller id. And for those who work from home as I do, the base has speakerphone with mute so you can dial into those conference calls and multitake without having to worry about holding a handset to your ear or a lot of background noise."
1,Panasonic's Terrible Return Policy,"The phone lasted 2 days when the speaker went out. I called Panasonic and they said to unplug & plug the phone back in. This works but I have to do it about every other time I use the speaker. If you return this phone you do NOT get a new phone. You get a refurbished phone. Also you have to go without the base unit until they send you another unlike a lot of companies who send you a new one with a box to return the old phone. I only buy Panasonic phones and this is the first time one has gone bad. This is a terrible return policy. If a phone breaks within 2 weeks you should get a new phone, not a phone that has been overhauled."
3,Marathon Flight Ready Case,Sturdy case. Components (Behringer mixer and VocoPro mike amp) fits nicely in case with room to store and transport cables and power strip.Only drawback is that I thought (and I wish) that the computer shelf was a sliding shelf as opposed to a flip shelf. One other drawback is that this case is very heavy. Someone should manufacture this same design utilizing a lightweight plastic.
4,Another enjoyable book in a delightful series,"Daisy Dalrymple Fletcher has a knack for stumbling upon bodies. This time, she discovers the local dentist dead in his chair. As Daisy and her husband Alex, a Chief Inspector with Scotland Yard, investigate, they discover that some of their respectable neighbours are hiding some rather scandalous secrets.This is another solid entry in a consistently enjoyable series. Set in 1920s England, peopled with colourful characters, and with a subtle skewering of the upper class, these books remind me a little of the works of P. G. Wodehouse.If you enjoy light historical mysteries, you might want to make Daisy's acquaintance."
1,Cheap art work tells the story .........,"I bought it as a cheap experiment. The experiment failed. No matter what you pay for it, it's worth less."
3,Brilliant but too small,"This is a very simple product, well executed. But too small. Fills up several times a day with just one person. If they had a large size to offer as well, that would be helpful. Doesn't really work as a sole trash can for the kitchen. Maybe good for potato peelings and the like."
2,Midnight in St. Petersburg,"The story and plot are good, but not the best screenplay. The quality of the DVD reproduction of the original film is fair, at best. The sound has a slight ""hiss"" in the background that is annoying at first. Not one of Micheal Caine's best performances."
2,A good movie for a blizzard,"Hm, this is a good movie to watch when you're snowbound in a blizzard, with nothing better to do. I like Michael Caine, but this is a poor movie: wooden characters, contrived plot, terrible script. One viewing is enough, and perhaps more than enough . . . if you can get through it."
1,Midnight in St. Petersburg,"Since Michael Caine decided not to fulfill the two remaing films in his original contract from the 60's, he should have left this one for Jude Law, who he now endorses to play the new Harry Palmer. Let's hope he can get the project off the ground with ""An Expensive Place To Die"" penned by Len Deighton."
2,batman begins gloves (child),"These gloves are REALLY BIG! I have a 6yr old boy and the gloves swim on him. Also, they are not stretchy at all, so he has trouble bending his fingers in them. And... the ""gauntlets"" do not stand up away from the gloves (as they do in the pictures), so they actually look more like large western fringe. These gloves went straight to the bottom of his toy box! Had I known all of this in advance, I would not have bought them."
5,a true genius,"I had the opportunity to meet Clive Barker in Minneapolis MN, and had him sign this hardcover. The History of the Devil is by far one of my favorite things by Mr. Barker. It has an interesting twist and beautiful characters who you feel like you know. This is a wonderful set of plays and I highly recommend it."
2,thin Latex,The product is very thin latex.. so water gets in.. There are many other latex bathing caps that are stronger thinker Latex and prevents less water to get in the cap.
5,RED CARPET STUDIO BICYCLE PLANTER,"A BEAUTIFUL AND FUNCTIONAL PRODUCT! EXTEMELY WELL MADE AND A REAL EYE PLEASER. CAN BE USED FOR GREENERY ONLY, OR POTS OF REAL FLOWERS."
3,CD 1 Wrong Music,"I put the CD in and was met by club music, I thought maybe it was some strange take on ""Morning in the City of David"" nope, the CD had been burned with the wrong image. I sent it back and received a new copy, it had the same issue. I listened to the second CD and loved ever moment of it, but until EMI/Amazon can rectify this issue, I cannot fairly rate it."
2,CD 1 WRONG MUSIC,"I was very disappointed when I listened to CD 1 and realised it was club music.Having now read the other review I don't think I will get satisfaction,therefore I cannot rate this item properly.ErrolBarbados,West Indies"
4,It is helpful..,"I am a Japanese user of this CD-ROM dictionary. It is helpful when I need thesauruses of the word. I, however, would like to expect that users can highlight and copy the parts selected by a mouse."
5,good stuff,"best stuff, i wasnt sure if it would work, but it does exactly what i want. allows my asian hair to be moldable and does not have the shine that other products have."
2,Too heavy for thinner hair,"I purchased this product because of the relatively large presence of positive reviews. I'm writing this review to give another perspective. This product is far too heavy for hair that is on the thinner side. If your hair falls into this category, I would recommend D:Fi from this same brand."
2,"Expensive, dries out fast","At first opening, this is a great product. Its a very light hair cream that gives you a messy look without the wet, gelish look. However, in a matter of a few weeks, the appearance and texture of the cream gets pretty dehydrated and hard to get out and rub into your hair. On my first can, I thought it was just me being careless about tightly closing (not easy to do with wet hands.) On my second can, I was nuts about closing it tightly. It didn't make much of a difference. I think this product would do well with a better container, and at the price you are paying, I think its fair to ask for that. I can't recommend this until they have a better airtight system."
2,Great product but size incorrect,If you look on lid it says 85 grams. It should say 100 grams for 3.53 oz. which is boldly shown in title of product. Thought this was too cheap for the amount and now I know why. Was shipped fast but like I said not the correct amount was received.
4,A fine price guide,There are plenty of price guides for comic books. I like this one because it seems the cleanest to read and follow.
2,Comic Values Annual 2003,"The ratings of each comic is very good, however the biggest problem is that the index gives wrong pages as to the location of many of the comics. Then too the binding is coming apart after only 45 days use. It would be a good thing to offer a replacement that is correct and better bound."
5,I love this eyeshadow!,"This is my favourite eyeshadow and I use it as a base for everything! It's a pretty pinkish/lavender iridescent colour. I blend it with pink or purple, usually, but it'll work great with blue or green, as well. Prestige seems to have discontinued it, so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon! Yay!"
5,Informative and thought provoking,"This book was very helpful in thinking through a variety of issues regarding our children's involvement in sports, particularly the material about the developmental considerations. It appealed to me as both a parent and a clinical social worker."
4,Good material for any parent or coach,"The authors have done their research, observed the field in detail and as such they provided an insightful guide to parents and coaches in youth leagues."
3,Excellent technical info,"Mr. Spielberger, as usual, provides excellent technical information about tanks, in this case the Pz IV. Unfortunately, he has some flaws: No index and no chapters. This makes using his books for reference a bit difficult. It can also be confusing as to which model of the tank he is refering to or whether something is relevant to all models. For example, he comments that it took 15,000 work hours to build a Pz IV but he does not specify if this is for the early or later models. If you find info you want to refer to back later, be sure to mark the page(s) yourself. That said, this is one of the best technical works for the price available."
5,Plenty of detailed information!,One of the best Spielberger from the 'Motorbuchverlag'.Many different vehicles with marvelous pictures!
2,it's not that it's bad...,"it's just redundant. it's the fartz reunion album, yet 13 of the songs are just new versions of the old classics on the alternative tentacles anthology thing cd. these guys still have the power they used to have, it's just kind of pointless to release a new album of old songs in my opinion."
3,very cheaply made,This is a very cheaply made part and the bolts that were included were too long and wrong thread for my Durango despite it being the correct part.
2,Cheap Quality,Very disappointment--poor quality--paint is chipped on every single heart! NOt surprising since it comes from China. Do nott waste your money.
5,Love it!,Excellent indoor decoration. The hearts have a red shade and the crystals look beautiful. I hanged it beside the east side windows so that the sun shines on it in the morning. I love it!
2,very cheaply made,"This is a very cute design, but the paint application is very cheaply done -- paint was sloughing off as i was taking it out of the box and hanging it up."
5,Just Stunning,"It is a wonderful thing when you purchase something on line and when it arrives it is even more beautiful than imagined !!!!!!!!!!!Simply sweet and pretty . Made very well and shipped perfectly . BUY IT , you will be happy you did ."
2,Not the best product,"I used the cd only for the first exam so far, but I have to say that I'm not very pleased with it. Not many questions about PL/SQL and lots about group functions. Further on it would have been nice to get some question numbers, so you can see where you are concerning the timing.Overall, not a success."
1,Frustrating to use,"The software contains 1000 test questions 500 per certification exam. I was thinking this would be great I can create the random tests with 20 or so questions each time. When you create a random test it gives you most of the same questions each time. Also, some of the syntax on the questions is questionable. I am severely disappointed with this product."
4,Real People from the Old West,"This book is filled with highlights of the West and stories of ""regular"" people going/living in the West."
1,"One condactor copper ,one I think aluminum",Not what was on description one line copper one aluminum . Not two conductor same .I am very very very disappointed
1,Not what is shown or described.,"100ft 16 AWG Bulk Speaker Wire. The number, 27293 matches that shown on the description so it was not a shipping error. Only one conductor is copper. It says conductors (plural) are 99.9% copper. Picture shows 2 brown strands. I waited 9 days to get HIGH QUALITY wire. I could have gotten the same item locally for less. VERY DISAPPOINTED."
3,"Does the job, but could be better","I have to admit that this product did what I was looking for (get my bike off the garage floor), but it is not quite as easy to use as I had hoped. It lowering the bike is not as smooth as I would like and the single hoist point design makes it difficult to keep the bike straight while it is raised. Have not found anything that I like significantly better, however."
3,"Every twist and turn in the tale, yet a struggle to read.","Gordon Prange's achievement is noteworthy. The reader gets the feeling that Prange's 37 years of research yielded all the information that exists about the tragic attack. Every question is answered, no stone is unturned. But the book would have been so much better if his assistants had been professional writers rather than military personnel. Not only is the prose wooden, but each military subject in the story, on both sides, is the very peak of professional military bearing - the term ""soldier's soldier"" appears constantly in these pages. The effect is similar to a former coach appearing as a TV analyst, unwilling to make the tiniest criticism of his former brothers in the coaching fraternity, even when the decision is obviously, howlingly stupid. Therefore, the final judgments, particularly of Gen. Short, don't impress as comprising Prange's true, unvarnished opinion."
4,Very well researched but not a thrill a minute,"This book is extremely well researched and is very informative, especially concerning the planning of the attack, the pre-war American and Japanese navies, and the responsibilities of the Army and Navy concerning the protection of the fleet at Pearl Harbor. What it is not is a story of the attack itself, the description of which only lasts about fifteen or twenty pages. If you like to read narrative histories along the lines of David McCullough and Barbra Tuchman, you might find this book a bit dry."
4,An Excellent Historian,"I see that some reviewers were critical of ""At Dawn We Slept."" It should be noted that, while Dr. Prange did do the research, the book itself was put together after his death by two individuals who had previously been his graduate students. Having known Dr. Prange, I'm certain that had he survived to complete his work, the final product would have been much more satisfactory."
2,Time marches on ...,"This text should be highly valued in providing a first glance or survey of Pearl Harbor, but given the passage of time since its publication, it is now very dated.With the release of newer materials, it should no longer be considered ""definitive"" or even ""authoritative."" It is also widely known to have several flaws (e.g., lacks the Brigg's interview) and factual errors (e.g., how are blinker lamps and signal flags ""heard"" in tactical radio circuits)."
3,Essential Reading But Leaves Something To Be Desired,"Gordon Prange's AT DAWN WE SLEPT is regarded as one of the best sources on the Pearl Harbor attack, and with good reason, since it provides an extremely detailed study of the matter, particularly from the Japanese point of view. However, its very thoroughness turns out to be a fault, because it ends up coming across as padded and suffering from a difficulty in getting to the point.This book actually reads like a rough manuscript that was superficially hammered into shape and then shoved out the door, which is I believe more or less what it is. What it really needed was a good editor who could have cleaned it up and trimmed it down -- it could have easily been cut to three-quarters of its length, possibly even half, without losing anything but tedium. In sum, this is a worthwhile book, but it's also annoying at times, and certainly well more of a slog than it needs to be."
4,At Dawn We Slept,"Haven't had time to read it yet, bur hoping to get started soon, as I am a big fan of history, and Pearl Harbor.At Dawn We Slept: The Untold Story of Pearl Harbor"
5,"Well argued, wonderfully written, and uses all sources.","This book is an example of good exhaustive historical research and balanced conclusions. Although long, it is gripping and academic, (a sometimes rare combination, as I've found out in my graduate studies). One should read this book and also read the book by Henry C. Clausen, since he was an actual investigator into the tragedy. Prange should be congradulated for using Clausen's perspective something many other authors of Pearl Harbor didn't use. Read this book!"
3,Excellent history - poor reading,"This book is wonderfully detailed, so much so, it becomes difficult reading. Most WWII enthusiasts will more than likely become bogged down with the mountain of details provided by Mr. Prange. If lacking patience and want WWII history which is more readable, I suggest works by Steven Ambrose."
5,THE BEST FRENCH SINGER,"Miss Croisille is the best French singer. Gifted with an incredible voice, and a great vocal range, she can belt out a song or whisper with much emotion to your ear. She can easily be compared to the greatest US or UK singers: Helen Merrill, for the jazz touch, or Shirley Bassey, for the ringing voice. She has an unique and very original tone quality. She used to perform in her early years in the USA, and has been heard since on many great international stages. This singer is a gem, and a classic. A Must!"
1,Disappointing - nothing more than a compilation of web pages,"There's no value added here. The author simply compiled a bunch of web pages for various coaching programs. This is easily done using google. It's worth something if you don't know anything about web searching, don't have access to the internet, or are going away for a week and want to leave your computer behind. However, in all cases she refers the reader to the webpage for further information. The most disappointing thing of all is that she added nothing. The title is misleading because the book offers nothing about how to train at home or the process of training at home or even how long it might take. She did no research."
2,Don't judge this book by its title!,"OK, now I know to read reviews! A better title for this book would have been, Life Coaching Educational Options. This book appears to have been ""cut & pasted"" from the Internet. I bought it as a less expensive option than coaching school, not to read a list of schools!The ""book"" is a great list of schools that have easy-to-find websites. The list compiler probably spent a full day or two on www.google.com to find, block, cut and paste this ""book.""The title is very deceptive!On the flip side though, $12.95 + S&H is not a bad price for a reminder that the world is filled with unscrupulous folks! From this perspective the book was well worth every penny!Perhaps the author could next compile a list of porn sites, call it a book and title it ""How to Have a Loving Relationship."""
1,Train at home to become a certified perosona;/life coach,"I was robbed. It is nothing more than a compilation of titles. I was looking for the practical side of coaching. I do not feel I need more training. I feel that the author merely took lists from the Web and stuck it in book form. The book is in the trash. I hold a master,s in education. I have lifelong experience!I was just looking for the nuts and bolts of where to meet and what fees to charge, stuff of that nature. I think I will write the real book of how to become a life coach with practical advice."
2,New Writers are Needed,This 4th season is tedious and not terribly interesting. The Afghanistan story line may be politically correct and felt to be timely but is not entertaining. Patty Hewes is not involved as much and that is the problem. Doubtful that I will buy any further seasons.
1,Closed Captions Pleasssssseeeee!,"Why, if DVS has Closed Captions, yo don't let the people watch the series with them!!There's a lot of people out there with audition problems and/or people who doesn't speak English well and they need Closed Captions!!!!!!!Please."
2,Waste of money,"I had high hopes for this little syringe, but it doesn't hold much water, is a pain to refill, and makes me gag when I try to use it. A waste of money."
1,"Season 4, what were they thinking? Great show ruined.","After raving to my friends and family about how Damages was the best drama on TV, I finally get to see season 4 on DVD and what do I find: a once-great show cast into the very morass that the US is sick of (and for good reason): Afganistan, Abu Grav (sp), torture, and everything else that Dick Cheney holds so dear. If people are fed up with our involvement in MidEast wars, sickened by waterboarding and other acts that we have punished armies of other countries for, and all the related bullshit, why on earth would we want to pay to see more of it on TV. What a waste.I'm trashing the DVDs I bought and saying good riddance to a show that I used to love.WAKE UP producers and writers!!! We hate this shit."
1,disappointed,"They replaced drama with blood, guts, and foul language. Constant use of the ""F"" word brings nothing to the show.I guess that everyone is use to it by now, SADEllen's new hair do reminds me of a 15 yr old poor girl from the 50sWill skip the final season when available"
1,Don't BUY it.,"Freeze these scams out, you pay enough for TV now and they want you to buy a season. Borrow it. E bay? Don't let them make enough money without going back to what you pay for now. GREED"
3,Weak by comparison but OK,"Having absolutely loved the first three seasons, I had to have this if only to find out what happens to characters that I love. It is not even close to being as good as what came before. It starts to get better as it goes and I don't regret having watched but I am still a bit disappointed. Not as smart as it once was."
5,Great Fourth Season,"I have enjoyed Damages since I caught on to it's dramatic and cut-throat style. It was a great season, with superb performances and a good storyline."
1,"""Damages"" Fourth Season","This was a big disappointment compared to the other seasons. I didn't even finish watching the season. Too bad, as the other seasons are quite good."
2,Damages,I was really looking forward to watching this season of Damages since it was removed from the F/X network and moved to Direct TV. It was not all I had anticipated. Other seasons were much better. It was nice to see some of the characters from season one in brief flashback spots. But other than that I would suggest you rent it instead.
2,disappointed,"Wow, what a disappointment! I thought the previous 3 seasons were great, but season 4 was so boring.....!Glenn Close is hardly in it at all, and the sub-plot(s) with her little girl's illness and then return of Patty's estranged son seemed unnecessary and tedious. John Goodman gives a great performance but for me , the allure of Damages is watching all Patty's scheming and plotting slowly being revealed and her twisted relationship with Ellen.I was bored by all the flash backs to Afghanistan , and all the repetitive scenes with Sanchez in his cell. Way too much time was spent on this and I just didn't find it interesting enough.Hopefully season 5 sees a return to Patty Hughes at the center of the show!!!"
4,A GOOD MOVIE REVIEW,THIS MOVIE WAS FILMED VERY NICELY AND THE DIRECTING WAS WELL PLAYED. GLEN CLOSE WAS A GOOD REPRSENTATIVE OF THE SUBJECT LINE OF THIS FILM. THE MOVIE WAS ENJOYABLE.
5,Damages: The complete Fourth Season,The BEST! I've enjoyed this since season one. It builds and gets better every year. Can't wait for season 5.
1,Don't be fooled,"I gave this one 1 star, not because of it's quality, but this misleaded me. I thought it was a block big enough, ja! ja! When I received it, my surprise!: this block in size(it's length) was not bigger than my thumb. Just to give you an idea, it's length is about the same length as a Zippo lighter.For $1.00, this product is OK, but not for what is selling for."
1,Wolfwalker Stumbled,"This book was found to be difficult to read and follow, I was unable to grasp the characters purpose or depth. Fortunately, I only made it through the first couple of chapters and discovered the book to be basically boring. I would not recommend."
5,It was a wonderful book!!!,"This book was about Dion and her twin brother who set out on an adventure, one that they can never forget. As a healer and a wolfwalker she saves lives, heals, and guids friends through the forest. She also find something she never thought could happen, Love."
3,NOT BAD FOR THE PRICE,"I just bought this toaster oven today at a local Lowe's store for $10 less than the price listed here. This will be my third Euro-Pro oven. The one it is replacing only lasted two years before the ""Function"" dial got stuck on ""Toast"" last week, but I like this brand because it has two racks so I can bake more than one thing at a time if necessary. I just want to let everyone know that the dimensions listed here are for the box - not the oven. The actual dimensions of the oven are 17.5 inches wide, 9.5 inches deep, and 10 inches high."
1,Timer Doesn't Work,The timer doesn't work. It starts ticking and then stops after a few seconds regardless of how far it is turned.
2,Cant' wait to get a different one,"While I agree with the previous review that this toaster oven is inexpensive and that the white color is very nice for blending with any kitchen, I am unhappy with the purchase.The double rack and multiple trays are a pain to store and use, frankly. You can't open the bottom of the oven to get crumbs out and using the extra crumb tray is a pain, because it burns and it's hard to get in and out. And crumbs still fall below it anyway.The timer is VERY unpredictable. It often gets stuck when it's under 10 minutes (which is a lot if you're toasting) and so your food burns if you're not right there.More problematic is that if I want to run several cycles of toast, I can't. It seems that one is its limit. I would recommend using the ""Stay on"" button if you're doing multiple toasting cycles and just stand right there and watch your toast.So all in all, I'm never buying another one. And I'm sort of hoping it dies soon so that I can get something else."
1,TERRIBLE!,"This is the worst toaster oven I have ever had or used for that matter!The heating is completely uneven, the bottom of things burns while the top is raw and the back of the oven heats MUCH more than the front. The door does not close well. The timer has a ticking noise that you can't turn off and you can't put the timer for less than 10 minutes or it won't stay on."
2,Eh,It is shown correctly as it arrived but doesn't work well for swimming which was my main purpose for this product.
1,poor quality,"I'm generally not a ""picky"" person. Having said that, this book was very disappointing. The craftsmanship was poor. This is a reprint and the OCR scanner they used mistook nearly all of the ""s"" charachters for ""f"" charachters. This makes for difficult reading to say the least. As for content, this book contains the same material as the monitor we use in the Tennessee lodges, with the addition of some of the York Rite work."
1,Great if you like boxed cakes,I purchased this book because I have a lot of bundt pans. I was disappointed to see almost half the recipes involved a box cake. I buy cook books to make things home made not via boxed cake mixes. It basicially told you to buy a box of cake mix and add this and that to it. Who can't do that themselves? Not a good cookbook at all. If you want lessons on how to make boxed cakes than you'll like this box. I make all my cakes homemade so this book was useless to me.
3,Bundt cake recipes,"Great recipes, but a lot of them refer to all kind of prepared mixes: yellow cake mix, chocolate cake mix, etc. There are also recipes ""from scratch"", which are not difficult to make."
3,Nordic Ware Bundt Cookbook,"I would have preferred some more pictures for a visual reference, but as a collection of basic and adaptable recipes this does suit my puproses, particularly in regards to quanity of ingredients and pan sizes."
5,Amazing!,"I have really problematic skin, I get pimples and blackheads and whiteheads of every kind. A friend suggested I try this product, and she has amazing skin, so I decided to go for it. I am so glad I did! My skin has cleared up so much! I have been taking 5 a day and by the end of the first bottle all the major pimples were gone! I still have a little bit of blackheads, but the difference in my skin is just amazing! I am so glad that I found these pills because they suggest 5000mg a day, and that means just five pills compared to taking 10 of the 500 mg ones. I also use clinique facewash with a clarisonic mia to wash my face, and my skin is looking better every day!"
5,great oroduct,"it really works , it took 6 months to cleared my face , i started from 10pills a day and now i take 3pills per day"
2,Didn't work,"I bought this product because I heard about the effects of this on acne. Not sure why, but this did not work for me. Good luck to others who try it and it works for them. The product itself was fine, came quick and seemed good enough. Gave it two stars because it was quick and what I ordered."
5,Acne resolved,"Truly a miracle product for acne. Within the first week I saw deep acne stop erupting. I would get a zit after working out in the gym. I've been taking this product for about three weeks along with Zinc for acne and will continue to do so. I had been doing the acid peels on my face and still had acne eruptions, so I kept searching and found these two supplements. The reviews sold me and now I firmly agree with them."
2,For acne use,I was doing the mega b-5 for acne and I have tried several different brands. This was hardly effective for that purpose. I found Twin-Lab to be the best. I have to take more capsules but get MUCH better results.
1,DON'T FALL FOR THESE FAKE REVIEWS LIKE I DID.,"This stuff does NOT work. can't believe I wasted my money. Ive been taking these pills for a month now, two pills a day and it SUCKS! It doesn't reduce oil, and it seriously does nothing. It might even damage your liver. I clicked on the profiles and most of the reviewers profiles only comment on this product. It's a scam! Please just see a dermatologist because this is not what you're looking for if you have acne"
2,No difference,"I purchased 3-4 bottles, used this for 2 months (5-6 capsules a day with food) and didn't see a difference in oil or anything else. At this point Apple Cider Vinegar seems like a better treatment"
1,Pantothenic Aced,"I bought it for my 14 years old son. He has a lot of acne. We do everything,and now we have used this product. No difference at all! I am very dissapointed. It was a waist of money!"
5,1938 Edition Collectable copy of The Yearling with Dust Jacket,This copy was shipped fast with updates by email. The book is a nice collectable copy of the Pulitzer Prize winning book by Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings. The Dust Jacket was in better condition that I had anticipated. The copy was carefully wrapped in styrofoam padding and arrived in excellent shape. This vendor offers quality items at a very reasonable price and communicates the status of the order as well as being very expeditious. The condition of the pages was also much better than I was anticipating. I highly recommend this vendor.
5,Inacurate,The description for this book above in inacurate. The description above is the summary of her book Love @ First Site unless her book dot.homme is the same book.
5,Great indoor workout,"If you need a 60 minute workout and you're tired of the studio biker DVD's, give this one a try. It's a very nice change to see a group of riders out on the road. The video alternates between helmet and automobile cams. The ride is on a sunny day which helps when its actually 10 degrees outside (I'm in Chicago). The workout itself is a series of intervals ranging from a few minutes to 8 or so. Just when you think the intervall is complete, she throws in a 30 second steep climb. The coach is a female with a nice soothing voice which is also a nice change from the drill sergeant barking in other videos. She gives guidance on cadence and effort throughout the workout. If you follow the directions, your legs will feel the burn. For best results, use a HR monitor."
4,Let's Get Naked,Deborah is back with her new single(Naked)it is a graet song and i amhoping it get's air time. When youlisten to this song and you can tellshe is no longer Teen Queen. And thisis the new Deborah and i like it!!!!!!If your a Fan this single is for you!!!Thanks.
3,"NOT DEBORAH GIBSON STYLE , ANYMORE","overall good cd, music is very different from other music of deb's, I miss the old music. deborah now in playboy, and she is really getting crazy. I probally won't listen to anymore of her music!!she really is out of control. and dont like her music anymore. just to trashy with this song Naked. this is loud crazy song of hers. its Not deborah gibson style music anymore. last song I liked was, with all my heart. thats all of debbie gibson... No-more."
5,Very good CD.,"As a fan of this artest, It was nice to be able to het this singel. again, it.s not available here in Ireland."
3,The Complete Java2 Training Course Problems,"I emailed the publisher 6 days ago and have not received a response. Since the publisher has not responded, I am not sure if I installed the cyber classroom incorrectly, or if there is a problem with the product.The only links that seem to work are the links that take you to other pages within the text, or to someplace on the Internet. I have installed it twice and do not feel it is an installation problem.I had to wait quite some time for the package to be delievered, and now find that it has problems. In its current form I do not feel the package is usable."
5,Best Out There,"Simply put, this book is the best out there, if you want to really learn Java. I should know; I bought all the rest before I stumbled across the Deitel format. The other books took the familiar ""This is how it works, but we're not going to show much about how to use it"" approach. Not so, here. Great detail, great examples, great hyperlinked references throughout. Much more for your money. Good luck."
4,Wisconsin,"I purchased the JAVA 1.1 Complete version of this book. Deitel actually has ""LIVE"" code in that version that is usable and executable. The complete version of JAVA 1.1 was written in a different format than this one.. The interactive links in it are superior.The second version is supplied in a HTML format. Half the programs in the interactive mode do not execute, link or save properly. I know it isn't the code.This is really a shame. Deitel & Deitel are truly the best source on Programming yet! Java 2 is really tricky and half the book sources available are coding with deprecated(old and unexecutable) methods without an IDE that can migrate old code. This is so frustrating beyond end. The book is still excellent. It is a shame they migrated to this new format, otherwise it would deserve 5++ stars"
3,The Eggers segment,"I have not read Eggers first book which was given the highest critical praise in a number of places. But because it has such high praise I was curious to hear Eggers himself. It was by and large a disappointment, as he did not show any particularly great verbal brilliance or human insight. Nonetheless I have since seen reviews praising his second book which if I remember rightly about the situation in Darfur, its refugees.Perhaps then it was my fault more than the participants that I did not particularly feel illuminated by this segment."
4,"Funny, insightful look into a treatment that no longer exists","In this book, Betty McDonald writes about her experience with t.b. and being in a sanatorium for 9 months -- at the time the only way they had to cure a patient, and hardly a guaranteed one.Like The Egg and I, I started out really into this book, and by the time it was over I was as ready as Betty was for her to go home. However, the look into life in a sanatorium in the 1930s, when there was no known cure for tb and doctors barely even understood what it was, is certainly an interesting slice of life.Also: I read my uni library version of this book, which was personally inscribed by Betty herself, to ""Bernice, who has been through this in all its phases -- Love, Betty McDonald"" The two doctors who the book is dedicated to have also signed the book. And glued to the inside cover is Betty McDonald's obituary. So apparently the original owner of this book knew her. (This is why library books are so much cooler than store-bought ones)"
5,Great book but slightly smelly,"I have loved this book for years and purchased this copy so I could loan it to friends without fear of not having it returned. The copy I received was as described, slight yellowing of pages but a tight, sound binding with library markings. The one thing that wasn't mentioned was the smell which leant an ""air"" of Northwestern authenticity to the story. While there was no sign of mold, the scent of mildew was very present.Still, read this book. It is wonderful."
5,great!,"It's rare you find a book about TB that's funny (who ever cracked up constantly when reading The Magic Mountain?), but if you're looking for one, here it is. MacDonald turns her stay in the Pines into a humorous, lively tale involving a succession of roommates (some lively, some intelligent, and some just plain aggravating) and patients, authoritarian nurses, bickering daughters, and more about sputum than you'll find in the average book. I've read this book over and over; the binding is hopelessly cracked and bent out of shape. I borrowed this book from my mother several years ago, and I have refused to give it back! Great reading-- I highly recommend it."
5,For Anyone!! patients and family members,I forgot to mention that John Boik's guide is the only source of quality information for Patients with cancer. His background on vitamins and herbals is clearly written and adds sophistication to the hunt for complements to chemotherapy and radiation.
4,Dog!?!?,"I don't watch this but however my son loves it! So for Christmas we bought him the series. And he is happy with them, so I guess it would be recommended!!"
1,Racists like him should be shunned,Before you buy this product please google Chapman and then think about whether you want to support someone who casually uses the N word.
4,Excellent cookery book,It is an excellent (and detailed) recipe book and another to add to the very long list already in my possession.
5,A worthy addition to any collection,"Classic Julia- what else needs to be said? If you're a fan of her work, you'll want to open up a little slice of shelf space for this volume."
3,The French Chef Cookbook,"I thought the book would have all the recipes with the DVD set I received in Christmas, but found out it was not."
3,French Chef Cookbook,The paperback book was in fairly good shape. While the front cover was slightly stained all the pages were legible andin acceptable condition for a paperback over 30 years old.
4,"The essentials of classic French cooking, but not mastery","If you aspire to French cooking, I cannot recommend ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" enough, and you DO need both volumes (the great breads are in the second volume.)But...if you want the most often asked-for French classics like Lobster Thermidor, Cassoulet and the classic desserts to use for your elegant dinner parties, this is a BETTER choice. It is slimmed-down, modernized, has photos and is the best of the best.So it's easy to choose; want to learn and read about French cooking, I like the Mastering series better (even better than Jacques Pepin's book.) Want a handy reference for classic dishes for occasional forays into French cuisine? Choose this one."
3,"False Advertising, Incomplete Collection","The blurb on the book says it contains ""All the recipes that Julia Child demonstrated on her first public television series - The French Chef."" There were several recipes I saw her cook in this series (currently being rebroadcast on the Cooking Channel) which I was excited to try. NONE of them are in this book. I suspect there is at least one whole season, possibly more, not included at all. Misleading, incorrect advertising fooled me, and I ended up with a very incomplete collection I would not have bought if I'd known."
5,I own it and I love it!,"Simply this, I own it and I love it. I think Julia Child was a wonderful French Chef, I ABSOLUTELY HATED HER VOICE! I watched her on TV growing up. I have several of her cookbooks and use each one for technique and suggestions. The lady (rumor has it) was a spy for the United States during WWII, working for the OSS, that became the CIA. But it's only a rumor.While not everyone's cookbook, there is a wealth of information and some wonderful recipes.Reviewer:I am a former ""Flying Tigers"" 23rd Tactical Fighter Wing, Information/Public Relations Specialist. I review things honestly, fairly and don't hold back if there is a problem and praise the good. I majored at the University of Toledo in Public Relations and Education with minors in Nutrition and Safety/Health and a former writer.My regards, John Marshall"
4,Does Not have every recipe,"I bought this book mainly to replace the copy of the pain de mie (plain white bread)recipe which I seem to have lost. It is not in this book.It was on season 9, episode 12,""The Good Loaf"". Which, if you have Amazon Prime, you can watch free. Otherwise this book is still a good value.But it does not have this recipe and many others."
3,polo sport after shave,"While I like this product, I do find that everytime i order it, the price is up 10 dollars, now if my pay were to rise like that i would not be writing this review-----------need i say more ?"
1,"""Gone in 60 seconds""","i Bought the polo sport perfume from AAA merchants. Bad choice. It looks just fine, in the box and everything, but the smell... ughhh. I've been wearing this fragance for many years because i like it a lot but i decided to buy it through them online. The fragance doesnt last and it doesnt quite smell the same. I hate this cheap smell of this one i bought from them. They say they only sell 100% authentic.. blah blah heyyy i know what im saying!! I cant return it since i live in another country and the shipping will cost more than what i payed for which was $35 or so. My girlfriend just purchased a Kenzo amour from AAA menrchants just recently, when i found out i wanted to kill her since i know it will be bad too."
4,It's okay,"I got it fast, but the presentation was kinda junky. The box was pretty beat up and I'm surprised it didn't break. It's hard to find this at stores anymore, so I order it online for my boyfriend and I guess as long as it's not a knock off or broken it works."
1,PERFUME POLO SPORT,"NUNCA LLEGO A MI CASILLA EN MIAMI, HAN FALLADO LOS QUE TRAMITAN LA MERCADERIA, HE COMPRADO EN OTRAS TIENDAS Y HAN LLEGADO SIN NOVEDAD, NO RECOMIENDO LA TIENDA KAUFMAN"
1,Wrong product,"I love this cologne for my husband...the smell is great, but I am giving it a one star because of the ""false advertising"". The listing states that it is Eau de Toilette spray, but what I got was aftershave. My husband will still use it, but it was not what he wanted. Just be careful that you order the correct one."
4,U2 is awesome ... The rest are great !!!,"U2 is really awesome, the best song in this album is this version of ""Elevation"", but you'll enjoy Moby and Chemical Brothers as well ...Nine Inch Nails has a great song, but they've had better ones, you should really buy this album, you won't be dissapointed ..."
4,I like it,"This is a good soundtrack. Its not as ""cool"" as say the matrix soundtrack, but there are some really good tracks on it, and I cant think of one that annoys me. And I love the songs without words in them, so I disagree with the amazon review. Soundtracks often have songs with no words, because those are easy songs to put in a movie. Its definitly worth the price I paid."
3,Not quite fit for a movie like this.,"A less than spectacular soundtrack for what promises to be an amazing film. Fatboy Slim usually puts out completely original, might I say addictive songs. The annoying song Illuminati is ceratinly nothing special. Though I like U2's Elevation remix for this film, I would have favored a more energetic song, such as Prodigy's Smack my B*tch Up. Afterall, it is an action movie. Satellite is great, with upbeat rhythm I just can't stop listening to. I am in know way degrading these artists, for their pieces are magnificent, but I just don't seem them fit for a movie like this."
2,Very So-So,"When I first read the list of artists on the _Tomb Raider_ soundtrack, I thought, ""now there's an album I need to get"" and promptly placed a pre-order. Unfortunately, this is not the album I thought it was. Other than a couple of new songs--the U2 remix of ""Elevation"" and the Nine Inch Nails contribution ""Deep""--the others are a very mixed bag of so-so techno and rap. _The Matrix_ it ain't. If you've been listening to electronic music at anything more than a novice level the past few years, you probably have most of these songs on other albums anyway. Big disappointment!"
1,"This ""compliation"" is decent","however despite what Amazon reviewer Kristy Martin may believe, Ms Croft does not need to get her freak on. Wow. I guess hip hop can do no wrong. In a soundtrack which is filled with apporpriate trax to supplement the film, here comes another fanboy/girl of hip hop's hopele$$$ley misplaced garbage. Thank you Kristy for proving to be yet another white suburban supporter of the most mass marketed crap to come along. (Missy)This song is soo done it's practically taboo to listen too. And Outkast? Puhf_ckingleez. These clowns sold out a long long time ago."
4,Overall a Very good CD!,"The songs on this CD were good and bad. ""Elevation"" by U2 is a very unique song and a nice beat. Elevation is one of the better songs on the CD. But other songs such as ""Ain't Never Learned"" by Moby. When I first purchased this CD, I was assuming that this song would be a good song like ""South Side"" (in my opinion). But it turned out Moby lacked a lot of his musical skills in this song. So as an overall review, 50% of the songs are good, 10% are OK, and 40% are bad. Thanks for reading my review!"
3,Bought it used because I only wanted the U2 song.,"It's a decent soundtrack, but I would have been much happier if I could have bought the song Elevation (Tomb Raider Mix) individually instead of buying the whole thing.The labels should really consider this. Instead of getting a cut of my .99, the label and artist got none of my money. Just the guy I bought it from."
2,dont believe all the hype,"I got this soundtrack b/c I thought it would be awesome because it does have U2, NIN, Outkast, Moby, Missy Elliot, and Fatboy Slim. the U2 and NIN songs are awesome!!!!!!!!! but every other song on this cd sux!!!!!!!!!! I was so disapointed because I wasted my money on somethin this disapointing.........but what can I say but don't waster your money. if u do wanna get it, get it for Deep by NIN and Elavation remix by U2....I did like the ""Get Ure Freak On"" song my misst elliot but the song on the cd is just Nelly Furtalo singing some crap in another language and Missy just sayin get ure freak on......and Outkast.......they have awesome songs like ""Mrs. Jackson"" and ""So Fresh, So Clean"" but this song just.........sux!!!!!!! please listen to me!!!!"
3,ryan hickneys tomb raider music review,"i thought it would have better music, or i should of payed more attetion to the music in the movie and assume that those songs would be on the soundtrack."
2,Not very good,"1. Good, the best here. 5/52. Meh-too weirdishly rocky/punky/technoey. (2/5)3. Same as #2.4. .........wtf is this? Nelly Furtado's attempts at rapping are embarrassing and painful to the eardrums. God, she sounds SO weird. Leave the rapping to the rappers, honey. I swear to God....when will this girl go away? She's a one-hit wonder, just like Natalie Imbruglia. If they had used the original with just Missy, it would have been great. But with Furtado's fumbling raps, this track just makes me laugh. (0/5)5. It starts out excellent, but then gets a little too frenzied. (4/5)6. O.......kay. (2/5)7. Not too bad. Sorta fun. *shrug* (3/5)8. O_o very very weird. It sounds like a bunch of priests chanting. (0/5)The rest of it is well just average. Way too much grunge rock and techno fizzles. This soundtrack has two good songs, a large handful of horrible songs and a few so-so ones."
4,At times it could be clearer...,"One thing about ancient philosophy and ancient Greek...it tends not to change a lot with time.Some of the terms in philosophy are unique to the field and other dictionariesor encyclopedias lack the depth or understanding to present them right.This dictionary may not be as current as one would like, but it answereda number of my question when I needed it.It will be helpful to anyone study the history of philosophy."
5,Love It!,12ft cord is exactly what I needed. Bought this with Prime and it was shipped on time. Have not tried the ethernet slots that it has but it is a really good surge protector imo.
4,Nice if you need the extra cord..,"I installed this on a stereo shelf about 8 feet off the ground, so the extra length came in handy. The surge protector itself is nothing fancy - it is pretty slim, which I found a plus. Having 7 outlets is also beneficial if you're hooking up electronics equipment..."
3,"Long cord, not much room for plugs","I like the 12-foot cord. I hate the way that all of the receptacles are facing the same way with very little room between them. Unless you have all narrow plugs, you won't get anywhere near 7 things plugs in. 4 is probably more realistic. That's all I got."
4,Great but not Perfect,"These will get the job done and offer little covers to cover to outlets if you are not using them. This item only gets a 4 star though because the covers fall off pretty easily and are not easy to put back on. The outlet itself though is great and the construction of it is really sturdy. It also offers protection of your items if something happens to it while plugged into this Belkin Outlet. It is a pretty heavy product, but overall, it is worth it.EDIT:Once the covers fall off it is pretty much impossible to put back on."
5,excellent surge protector.,"I actually wasn't sure if this would work for me, i was hoping. when I got it, it was better then i expected. It was long enough for my TV setup. The price was good to me. I looked around other site to compare pricing. I went to Kmart.com, sear.com, walmart.com, officedepot.com, staples.com, bestbuy.com, cowboom.com, and I found Amazon.com had the best deal. I have prime so i didn't have to pay for shipping, which was a factor in me buying it. Not sure what else I could say about a surge protector."
3,Basic Surge Protector,Its a little too big and looks like it is out of date. It gets the job done so it is okay. One positive note is that it has a very long power cord (12 feet) so if you need length there it is a decent buy. Obviously it isnt made for several power blocks so if you need one that is look elsewhere.
5,PERFECT - just what I needed!,"I have a roll-around desk with my laptop and speakers on it. I didn't like all the wires running off it to my bus-bar. Instead, I got this long corded one and strapped it to the leg of the desk. Now I worry about one cord and it doesn't get tangled in my casters.Perfect, perfect, perfect. Oh yeah, great build and nicely sized, too."
5,Great bang for your buck,"Outstanding value. Looked to be the most joule protection for the money. Mounted up well, allowing me to hide my plugs and cords behind my tv stand."
5,Belkin Surge Protector,I gave this as a gift to my brother--odd gift I know--all I can honestly say is that he likes it.
5,Useful,"I bought the outlet to accommodate all the clutter with my television set i.e. TV, DVR, WiFi & Router, etc. It does its task well, and feels solid."
5,Good Quality for less,"I was looking for a long corded Surge protector in many stores, but the maximum I could find was 6 feet cord. I found one TV surge Protector of 8 feet length for $45.Belkin 7-Outlet Surge Protector is a Very good quality one and a good looking one at that. It is the lowest on Amazon.com Elsewhere you may get it at the same price but when shipping & handling Charges are added the price will go up."
5,Good,"A good solid protector, from a company I trust. Many cheaper ones have short cords, and feels flimsy, but not this one. The long cord, and flat wall plug makes it a good buy."
5,Perfect,"I made a computer station for my kiddos out of a closet on the main floor. I needed a surge protector for the computer set up that had a cord long enough for me to run through the floor to an outlet in the basement. This works perfectly. The only snag I ran into is the the plug is sideways (perpendicular to the cord) so I had to drill a bigger hole to fit it through, but I'm sure this will be of no matter to most."
5,Does what it needs to do.,"No bells or whistles, but works like a charm. I would buy it again in a heartbeat. Especially helpful is the flat outlet plug."
4,Good product,Have been using this for few months now. Never had any trouble and do not foresee one either.It's very durable and value for money product
1,"Good looking, but","I bought a couple of these chairs used, and as the previous poster pointed out, the screws tend to pop out. I have six chairs, and I find it weird to seeing screws under my dining table all the time. You have to sit very still and not move around too much on the chair. If you happen to carry the chair around quite a bit and holding the chair by the seat instead of the chair frame. It is very likely that the chair seat will be pulled out from the chair frame, quite flimsy. The screw to the seat pad is the weak point of the chair. Also, you don't want to stand on the seat, it's creepy to see how the seat pad sags. Stand with your leg spread to distribute your weight on the chair frame if you really have to. As bad as they are, they are still in my dining room. If you are a heavy set, you may want to put a steel plate underneath the seat pad. What the..."
5,Review -All 4 books by Jean Auel,"All four books are excellent reading. I have a personal copy of all four. The research work carried out by her right from the prehistoric times is indeed worth mentioning. We have left Ayla just in front of Joandalar's home, when are we going to get the next book? I am waiting rather anxiously for it. Hope Jean Auel does not dissapoint us any longer."
5,the fifth book,I think that this series is a facinating and capturing series. I was wondering if anyone knows when the fifth book will be coming out?
5,I love the series,"Do you have the 5th. book of the series? I just read ""Accross the Plains"" (if that is the name in english) and I can't wait to start the next one."
4,Everything You Need To Know,This is a good beginners outdoor cookbook...it gives details on every aspect of cooking with a dutch oven...very helpful.
1,Useless propaganda,"This book contains no useful immigration information at all. It gives a long description of what New Zealand is like, that you should have known before if planning to immigrate. All information glorifies the country in a totally unbalanced way, not with a single word mentioning the economic recession, unemployment, falling standards of living, political chaos etc. What is claimed in the description, that the book would help you to get through all the obstacles of immigration, is nothing but a lie. One chapter in the end childishly describes that you should sell your house well in advance etc. but that's all! DON'T BUY THIS BOOK - IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT N.Z. BEFORE AND HAVE ANY COMMON SENSE IT WILL ONLY MAKE YOU DISAPPOINTED! Once we have immigrated I will write a better one!"
4,Cute and good price for a one shot costume,"Considering my daughter only used this one night for Halloween, it served it's purpose well. It's cute, fit fine, and was good enough quality for the price. It runs pretty true to size, and it does look like the picture. I'm definitely satisfied with this purchase."
4,Got the job done,We just needed something for a Christmas play and this fit the bill. It seems to be made well enough.
1,Horrible Product,This was a piece of CRAP. They wings feel apart and broke the minute my daughter tried them on. The dress was see through and was made very poorly. The feathers also started to fall off right away.
3,nice except for the wings,"This costume was very pretty, but the wings it came with were not the same as pictured in the ad or on the package. When worn the wings would just fold over each other and twist sideways lying flat against my daughters back folded together. We ended up using safety pins to pins the wings out on the costume and it was fine. It was still a very pretty costume."
4,Marley & Me,"Like all dog stories this one is a tear jerker. The day my husband finished this book I found him sobbing on the bed with his arms around our own yellow lab. This is a well-written story which is very hard to put down once your have started reading. It is chock full of those juicy details from lives being lived, both human and canine. Of course we've heard it all before and that's what makes this book so appealing to so many people. When any of us fall in love with a dog or a person like Marley we're in for the time of our life!"
5,a great book,I wish I could give this book 6 stars...you'll laugh and cry...I couldn't put it down. If you have ever shared your life with a dog you will love this book. I can't say enough about Marley & Me
1,Not worth the money,"I hate to disagree with most people who have written glowing reviews of ""Marley & Me,"" but it's just not that good a book. If you want a very good, well written, make you laugh make you cry dog story, read ""The Dog Who Wouldn't Be,"" by Farley Mowatt.There are a few parts in ""Marley & Me"" that will make you chuckle, and the ending will bring forth the tears, but in between there isn't all that much going on. The book is more about the Grogan family than the dog, which I guess is OK, but it just reads like a journal. Many of the punch lines are well telegraphed, not that funny, and some are downright stilted. I kept hoping it would get better, but it didn't."
3,I mean this in the kindest way....,"I mean this in the kindest way....you have to be a dog lover to Looooovveeeee this book. And I am not, which is why I didn't looovvveeee this book. It was well written and a good read but I didn't find the dog to be endearing simply because I don't like dogs and think that they are smelly, unsanitary beings. And Marley was definitely that, destructive, smelly and unsanitary, the book made me glad that he had someone to love him because I certainly would not have lol!"
5,JUST TERRIFIC!,"I ENJOYED THE BOOK SO MUCH. I COULDN'T STOP READING IT. WHEN IT WAS OVER I WAS SORRY THERE WASN'T MORE. JOHN GROGAN IS A WONDERFUL, GIFTED WRITER. HE MADE THE BOOK FUN TO READ. IF YOU ARE AN ANIMAL LOVER YOU WILL FIND THIS BOOK SO WONDERFUL. I CAN'T WAIT TO LEND IT TO EVERYONE I KNOW THAT LOVES ANIMALS.IT WAS A GREAT STORY IN ADDITION TO THE STORY OF MARLEY. I ENJOYED READING ABOUT EVERYTHING HE WROTE ABOUT HIS LIFE WITH HIS FAMILY.IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE READ. I LAUGHED AND I CRIED AND IT ALL FELT GOOD."
4,Marley & Me: Life and Love with the World's Worst Dog,Just loved this book! Any dog lover will appreciate the humor in everyday life with our furry friends. I guess the only reason that I didn't give the book 5 stars is because we recently lost our 9 year old Golden Retreiver to cancer and it just made me miss her SO much!I do have a new (5 1/2 month old) Golden now and Marley has helped my husband realize what a good puppy our new little girl really is!!!Definitely recommended!
5,I loved it!,This is the kind of story that as a reader you will never forget. John Grogan's detail of the events with all of his family members and Marley was very well written. I highly recommend this book to anyone that loves dogs!
5,True devotion to a family pet,"This book describes most labs to a ""T"". I have two and both of mine have acted just like Marley at some point in their lives. I would never trade my labs for anything. If more families were as devoted to the pets are John Grogan was to Marley there would be far fewer animals without homes in the world. Great Book!!!"
5,Speechless...,"I'm speechless. This is one of the best books I've ever read. It was very well written and funny in and moving in all the right places. Thankfully, the author doesn't get sappy till the very end (let's face it we all know how it ends) which makes the story very real. It's the story of life with a dog more than the story of a dog, which makes it resonate."
3,Humourous and Heartwarming,"The story starts out interesting enough with Grogan and his wife adopting a puppy from a backyard breeder. There is a humorous tale of how the couple meets the puppy's father, and many other amusing quips of their experiences with Marley are sprinkled throughout the book. However there was a time I didn't think I was going to make it through to the end. The story droned on too much about family relationships more than I would have cared for. In fact I had to keep checking the front cover to make sure I was still reading Marley and Me, and not My Family and Me. The last couple chapters were heart wrenching and by the time I was finished reading I was able to look back at their lives, man, best friend, family and understand more of what Grogan was trying to express. It was worth reading once, but I did not make room for it on my book shelf."
5,A book that touches your heart,"I found this book by accident in the bookstore and bought it to read because the dog on the cover looked so much like my beloved Kelly. This book is for anyone who has ever had the privilege to own a dog. Marley isn't really bad he's just a happy lovable dog. We can all associate if we've owned a lab. Even if you haven't everyone will find a little of Marley that will remind them of their dog. I laughed so hard - my chocolate lab Jake is so much like Morley. As George Carlin said when you get a puppy you know it is not going to have a good ending, it's a tragedy in the making. We lost my Kelly to diabetes and the last 30 pages of the book were heartbreaking. I had trouble seeing the print because I was crying so hard. This is a book that will bring you joy and sorrow - but it is definitely worth the trip."
5,Delightful,"Being an animal lover and owning a dog, this is the best book I have ever read. I plan to read it several more times. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has a dog."
4,For dog lovers,A well written book by an author with a good sense of humor. Just an enjoyable book to read.
4,Heartwarming well written - Loved it!,"Having had labs and experienced life with labs, I absolutely identified with much of Grogan's stories of Marley. By the end of the book, I felt I knew Grogan, family and dog. What a wonderful tribute to man's best friend! I was also pleased to hear that Gracie (the new lab) is gentle and quite the opposite of her predecessor. Kudo's to you, John Grogan and your wonderful, well-told tail of the wonderful life of Marley. I laughed and I cried as I recalled some of my own special moments with my own dogs."
5,Amazing!!!!,"This book is full of fun and frolic! It makes you feel happy and sad (especially at the end...) I cried like a little girl!I have a 9-month old black lab who I found on the street at 5 months, so he is getting more loyal each day. He's roudy like Marley was too! And 93 lbs... Vet says he'll be 120 lbs! Yikes!Grogan makes you feel like you are there. He is an amazing author.I highly recommend this book to all ""Labrador EVADOR"" owners! Other dog owners will be able to relate too!"
4,"I Wish They'd Read My ""Wish List"" (and saved me the CRYING!)","This is simply a shout-out to my sister and brother-in-law who thought it would be ideal in presenting ""Marley & Me"" as a Christmas gift. They had good reason too! THANKS for this book! Its story and style had me planted on the sofa for a day and a half, some of I spent crying or laughing aloud. As a dog rescue transporter, I want to thank Mr. Grogan for NOT giving up on his dog and for embracing the life and love of a new one."
2,Not a friend of the working class man. . .,"I enjoy this book, and could really identify with the author's struggles, since I own a lab myself.But Grogan manages to alienate me with his mean-spirited comments about. . . people different from him.Here's what he says about the neighborhood he lived in in FL:""It began to take on a gritty edge as the original homeowners died off and were replaced by a motley group of renters and working class families.""Mr. Grogan--what is ""motley"" and ""gritty"" about working class families? Or people that rent? Not everyone can be a young professional like you.He spends several pages ridiculing the people of Boca Raton, although he ends up moving there himself.So I guess I liked the book but did not like the author."
1,Disgusting...,"Upon reading the summary and many reviews up on this site concerning the book, I'm quite convinced the majority of ""positive"" reviews are products of the writer or immediate friends/family. There is absolutely NOTHING good about this book. What masquerades as an ""adorable"" story of Marley the dog is a cover for blantant animal abuse. From reading about the owner choking Marley (and taking particular detail of the sounds the dog makes while being choked) to how the wife beat the dog with her fists during bedrest (christ, how can this book be so popular!? There's no way these positive reviews aren't fake!) any TRUE animal lover can feel the outrage with which the treatment of Marley can be met. Disgusting, appalling, narcassitic tripe."
2,world's worst dog owner,"I think this book is about the world's worst dog owner, not worst dog. He's just being a dog and doing what dogs naturally do. It was built up to be so funny and so far I'm not captivated."
2,Not for non-dog-owners,"A dog's life is not particularly interesting, and that goes for Marley in Marley & Me. With this in mind, of course, this book is more about Mr. Grogan's family experiences before, during and after the ownership of Marley. Unfortunately for the reader, but probably fortunately for Mr. Grogan, the author's family life is not particularly exciting, either. This book is unlikely to appeal to the non-dog-owner, and quick perusal of the positive reviews here support my claim. Although I do like dogs, Marley and his family do not seem very different from any other dog-owning family out there. Unless you have a Fido in the family, I recommend you pass on this one."
1,The Picture of the dog made me buy it,"Cute dog. Obnoxius owners.OK I am one of the few that did not enjoy the book let alone finish it. My hopes were to pass it on to mother-in-law, nephew, wife. I did not care for, let alone expect,a description of the couples sex habits & birth control strategy. Mix that in with a smattering of needless cursing and no one gets this book, it is heading back to the used book store where I got it."
5,The Likable Hell Dog,It lived up to all its reviews and was well worth the time and money. Everyone who borrowed it and the aunt we gave it said how much they enjoyed it. Pet owners will love it even if their animals were the best behaved in the world.
4,Sweet read.,"This book is a nice ode to a dog. A dog lover can definitely relate, and Marley's behavior is adorable at times. Not the most fascinating, can't put down book out there."
1,Overrated and very disappointing,"This book is a total letdown. The writing is so sugary sweet it's cloying. A sentimental book about his wife, his babies being born and a dog described as the World's Worst Dog in the title, but who actually sounds like a typical Lab. The humor is so mild, I had a hard time finding it. Give this a miss. Not worth the time."
2,What's so bad about Marley,"Folks, before you read this book please consider this review. My wife and I nabbed this book expecting it to speak to the relationship we have with our 85 lb. lab/rot mix. Sadly, this book failed to connect with us in any meaningful way. The author, renowned for his writing skills, spends most of the time describing meaningless details about the cost of a rug, the history of laborador retrievers, and numerous other useless items. He fails to depict this animal as bad (at least to a fellow dog owner). Most of this book is about the relationship between two over-expectant, self-centered, middle class Americans who are trying their damnedest to be materialistic. It's apparent that my wife and I possess a quite different value system than this typical American couple. Just a bit of advice."
2,SAD and not a real dog lover....,I had hoped this would be about a great dog lover but it was the average joe dog owner. I read everything .. you won't find me without a book. But i was a bit angry to end up having to hysterically cry at the end.
2,Marley Was Not a Bad Dog,"I don't know how John Grogan can classify Marley as the World's Worst Dog. Marley was full of love, life, loyalty and excitement. He wasn't cruel, didn't want to hurt anyone, didn't have a mean bone in his body. He just wanted to serve his owners and be loved! How is that bad???? That being said, the book was ok. I could have done without hearing about Mr. Grogan's insufficiencies in the bedroom. Finally, I know quite a few dogs that go absolutely crazy when there are loud sounds (thunder/booms) - and they are by no means mentally unfit and their owners have NEVER thought that the only way to deal with them was to put them to sleep. that is just ludicrous. Marley was a great dog - I just wish that his owners realized this while he was alive, not while he was dying."
1,typical bad pet owner book,"The first sentance sets the scene ""labs are calm and good natured"" I wish everyone in America would get over that miscomception. I am a professional dog trainer, and todays labs are mouthy,pushy, and not good for yuppie families. This week I had a client family with a another nasty lab puppy,, nice family, wish they had some sense and bought a better breed for kids. Poorly written book, lots of dog abuse passed off as training."
1,Marley and Me: Life with the world's dumbest population,I'm really dissapointed that this made the bestseller list. Truly. It's too bad the literacy rate is so high in the american population - you all don't deserve it. I suppose the ability to read is not neccessarily an indication of intellectualism. I am disgusted that this innocuous and insubstantial piece of fluff is considered quality literature.
1,Obnoxious Language!,"I only read 80 pages and returned it because the language in it totally turned me off. The author is very descriptive, but TOO DESCRIPTIVE about things that have NOTHING TO DO WITH MARLEY! He talks about gynecological exams, sex, and his dog's sex organs. He even nicknamed his first dog trainer ""Ms. Dominatrix"" of all things. For me, a big-time eye roller. I never got how Marley is the world's worst dog because he sounded like any normal puppy, so either this guy is a total novice or he couldn't think of a better title. I never read even half the book, so maybe the dog goes balistic or something by chewing up some more shoes (that's as bad as it got in the first part of it), but it's a warning to potential buyers...go to a book store and read some of it yourself first, then decide if the language is too obnoxious for you. For me, it made me cringe. I couldn't read it."
5,Life and Love of Dogs,"I thorough enjoyed reading Marley and Me. Josh Grogan has a warm engaging writing style and brings us into his family. He shares with us very tender moments and hilarious antics.I laughed outloud while reading this book and I am not one to do that. I also cried openly at times. If you are a dog lover, you will be able to relate to the stories of Marley.While Josh Grogan is the not the shining example of dog ownership and how to handle specific dog behavior problems, you can tell that he really did love his dog and usually had his best interest at heart. Although I must say I have to question his motives when he returns from Disneyworld and fails to rush to his beloved pets side as he is near death. I know from my personal experience that nothing could have kept me away from my dog at a time like that.All in all I would recommend this book as a quick read that that will bring enjoyment, laughs and tears."
5,one of the best dog stories written,"And I've read a lot of dog stories. I just repurchased this in the illustrated edition, which shows how much I love it. Every time I pick it up, I can't put it down again. For anyone who's owned a dog, you have to laugh (the scene where he's returning triumphant from dog training classes singing ""we are the champions"" is one a trainer of any wild crazy puppy can identify with) and agonize over, and laugh again, and cry. If you love dogs, you'll love this story. If you don't love dogs, this book just might convert you. ""Marley and Me"" is a champion ...book that is."
5,A must read,"I laughed, I cried, I snickered!! I am an animal lover, I do only have cats though, but Marley is a character. John Grogan's story will touch your heart and your soul."
5,You'll laugh and You'll cry,"What an amazing book. John Grogan's story of his loveable dog Marley is nearly impossible to put down. Being deprived of time, I hardly find time to read anymore. However, I made time for this book. This is a must read for any dog lover. While the author thinks his dog is the world's worst dog, Marley seems to be representative of the typical dog. Marley's antics and shortcomings is what made him, and all dogs like him, so loveable."
5,The dogs that live on in our hearts.,"On June 29th, 2005, we lost our beloved rottweiler, Jillian, to bone cancer. She was the sweetest and most gentle dog ever born, and the best friend my husband ever had. For Christmas I gave my husband John Grogan's wonderful memoir ""Marley & Me."" It was the first gift I ever gave him that brought tears to his eyes. We have both since read it and found it to be one of the most heartwarming and heartbreaking books we have ever read. We laughed and cried, and then when we finished the book we shared our own memories of our cherished pet. Thank you so much John Grogan. This book is a gift to all of us that have ever loved a dog."
1,"If you like Chicken Soup for the Soul, you will probably love this book","It's all in the marketing. If this Grogan dude told his publisher he wanted to write a book about what an amazing husband and father he was, how daring to live in a tough neighborhood, how clever to move to the backwoods, and how funny and witty and talented he was, the publisher would have laughed him out of the office. The same book, framed as a story about a misbehaving dog, is welcomed.Most of the American public fell for this too. This book was so poorly written and the language was so stilted and flowery that after about half the book I was just flipping through to get to the inevitable manipulative tear-jerking finish.I have a dog, I like dogs, I like stories about dogs, I just thought this book was stupid."
1,Poor Marley....,"I only made it half-through this book because I got so annoyed at how ignorant the Grogans are. To be honest, there are some things in this book, i.e the story were poor Marley was kicked in the chest to ""teach"" him not to jump on people, that are plain and simple animal abuse.I really do not understand how true animal lovers could love this book, because it seems quite obvious that the Grogans were not very good pet owners. I don't recommend this book at all. These people made enough money on a book about a dog that could have had a more loving home."
2,Not all it's hyped up to be,"I was truly disappointed in the book. Yes, there are heart-warming moments and with the predictable ending, of course there were tears. Simply having a heart enables a reader to feel what it's like to live through that fateful moment.Frankly, throughout the book it was tedious as John Grogan tried so hard to use imagery and analagies to make the reader laugh. Over all it was a pitiful attempt at humor. Yes, Marley is clearly endearing and any pet owner can relate to the antics. Still, there were several instances that I was astonished to read how mistreated Marley was. Clearly my heart goes out to Gracie and i can only hope the Grogan family has learned that an animal is not an accessory but a true member of the family."
2,My own dogs could have written a better book,"I had heard all the hype about this book and how ""heart-warming"" it was, so on a whim, I bought it. I want my money back. I could not get over the fact of how sorry I felt for Marley, having to put up with these people! Being an avid dog lover, I take my dog's care very seriously. I was cringing with the whole ""if we can take care of a dog, we can take care of a kid!"" feeling in the beginning, and obviously they couldn't take care of Marley. And I don't care how tired or strained you are, you DO NOT beat your dog and have to be pulled off by your husband. I'm going to admit, I didn't finish the book. I just couldn't. I already wanted those hours back that I had already wasted on it getting to the middle of it. Maybe it got better, but eh, I highly doubt that.I threw it against the wall. That's how much I cared for it."
5,Such a touching story!,"This is a book that any dog lover, especially one who own a lab, will greatly enjoy. I have never laughed so hard or cried so long while reading a book. The lessons Marley and John taught through this story will stay with me for years to come. After reading the book, I took my own two labs out for a walk. I enjoyed every moment of that walk...even as they barked nonstop, chased leaves blowing in front of us and dragged me down the street. Marley and Me is a touching story. I highly recommend it."
5,Marley & Me,I had the audio book on CD of Marley & Me and it was soooo funny I had to pass it on to others. Then when I saw the book on Amazon I knew I had to have it. If you are a dog lover you must read this book.
5,Will Make Grown Men Cry,"Get ready to ball your eyes out. This book is terrific, not only does it capture the love of animals but the beauty of just one life. This is a must read."
3,Tedium and Me,"I want to preface this by saying that I own a dog that I am smitten over. I was very confident that I would regard this book with a lot of affection, but such is not the case. The story was just boring. I found the author's writing style and descriptive phrases very tedious at times. It took me about two years and three attempts to get through this book, I found it that boring. Heart warming, maybe, but definitely slow-moving. That is probably why there aren't more three hundred plus page books that revolve around the family dog and not much else."
5,Marley is a Must Read!,To anyone who is wondering about all of the single star reviews I will say that this is a heart-warming tale about the life of a dog you will absolutely fall in love with. I devoured this book in two days and laughed and cried and loved every minute of it. And apparently 700 other people agree...John Grogan captures the emotion and essence of why dogs are man's best friend. All those who are overly critical of his pet owning or training skills are missing the point of this tale. It is a story that tells of how a master has unconditional love and tolerance for this crazy dog and a dog that reciprocates with unwavering loyalty and devotion to his best friend and owner.To anyone who loves dogs or even has a pet this story will capture your heart as you relate to the tremendous joy animals lend to our lives. I would recommend this book to friends!!
5,Emotional heaven,"This is one of those books that you just can't put down. John Grogan writes with such honesty and humor, I love his style. Of course, if you own a lab such as myself, you can relate to so much of his story. Even if you don't, it is just a great piece of non-fiction."
4,"Bogs down in the middle, but a big finish","By the end of this, I was in tears, as we read of Marley's long, slow demise, the most dreaded part of owning a dog. However, I lost interest about halfway through and actually put this down for awhile and read other things. Grogan weaves the story of his relationship and marriage into his tale of his dog, a huge golden Lab, not my favorite breed by a long shot. This book, and the subsequent movie, made this former newspaper reporter quite rich, which has made some of his ex-colleagues jealous. Oh well. They should know that stories about dogs, and pets in general, always create more reader reaction than stories about virtually anything else."
3,Where's the Dog Whisperer when you need him...,"I have to agree with those that felt this book was compelling and distressing. While the writer knows how to write and every dog owner and/or dog lover will relate to Marley's antics and surely fall in love with him, anyone that has ever trained or raised a high-energy dog will probably be crying out for the Grogan's to get some real training and educational help. (I kept thinking - ""Gee, you need to start watching the Dog Whisperer!"")Their random attempts at obedience training are generally misguided - and it made me feel sad for them all, that they didn't experience all of the greatness this dog could have brought them. In the end, this story came out to be more of a story of a dog that while never given the opportunity to live up to his full potential by this family - lived up to his full potential of being a loving and devoted family member all the same.If you are really a dog lover, I wouldn't recommend this one."
5,"Great story, well written, grabs your heart.","I've owned a Lab all my life. None as bad as Marley. John Groden's writing and descriptions of doggy behaviour are so true that you'll swear he's writing about your own dog - except for the awful stuff Marley did. I laughed and cried and I think the endorphins released helped me ""heal"" from my own injuries at the time I read the book. Give this book to all the dog lovers in your life. Our dogs provide us those missing ingredients in life: unconditional love, spontaneous laughter, constant companionship, protection, and in my case, someone to swim for my ducks. Marley's death and the Grodan family's grief caused me unremitting sadness by reminding me of all my dogs now gone and how I loved them all. I loved it! Steve Pauley MD"
1,Just Awful,"I started out hoping for some kind of drama, eventually, but the sickening sweetness was unrelenting. Combined with the fact these people had no business owning a large, strong working-breed dog. Gosh, the trouble they got themselves into -- how cute! Still cute. Forever cute. I started to flip through it. Then just flipped to the end. Started disgusted with the owners for one reason, wound up more disgusted for another. If you know anything at all about dogs, do not buy this book."
5,A Dog Lover's Delight!,"I bought ""Marley and Me"" at Barnes and Noble last weekend, and absolutely loved the book! The reader really gets to know John Grogan and his beloved dog, Marley, through the rich and colorful images he creates in his telling about Marley from his arrival in puppyhood to his years as a senior member of the Grogan household.I have no doubt that most all dog lovers will be able to relate to Marley's story at some level if only through Mr. Grogan's love for his dog. Were it not for the fact that I read this book before going to bed at night, I do believe that I could have finished it in one or two sittings...it was almost impossible to put down. A MUST READ for all!"
5,Marley & Me,"What a great read! I can't say enough about it. Thank you, John Grogan. I highly recommend the book to everyone."
2,I love dogs but bad writing,"I kept getting bogged down in the bad writing, but Marley was an awesome dog; wish I'd had him (from across the street)."
2,"You guys are kidding, right???","A best seller??? This book, although fairly cutesy, is so void of substance. Grogan thinks he's much cooler than I would ever describe. What a waste of time... and I am an avid dog-lover! With such obvious embellishments and dramatizations for the sake of the 'idiot masses', I was truly disappointed."
5,What a Book!,"This was a wonderful book. It was well written and made me laugh and cry. Anyone who has every owned a dog, espcecially of the retriever variety will love this book."
5,Marley & Me,"I purchased Marley & Me for a friend and had it shipped to them,As they are dog lovers and had a Golden Retreiver just like Marley.They loved the book. I was pleased with Anazon service. Shipped fast andin good condition. Thank You Vivian Zeyer"
5,This Cat-lover loves this Dog-book!! :),I am loving this book! I love the joy and warmth with which he writes about Marley's cute dog antics. I appreciate his sharing his journey in life as well--and great writing style!!
2,Am I the only one?,"Marley and Me is a story about life and love with the world's worst dog, Marley. It's no wonder why it's popular, it was written to be that way. We are talking bland city. Lots of the stories he tells I find annoying rather than interesting. It's also hard for me to relate to the woes of child rearing, especially the budget crisis involved. Don't complain to me about not being able to afford anything because kids are expensive, I didn't make you have the kids. I can see why my sister enjoyed it, it's very suburban. Apart from being bland and unrelatable, the dialogue is so stiff. He will describe the look that the dog will be giving him, and the context and everything will completely spell out the implication, but he insists on explaining what the look means. It's like he's writing for seventh graders or something. I find it almost condescending. Additionally, I don't really find it very, ""cute,"" which I'm sure others do. I find it tedious. Why am I reading this book again?"
1,Please sort and read all 1-star and 2-star reviews! Wretched book.,"Rather than read all the fuzzy-headed blatherings from non-serious unknowledgable people, be aware that this is written by a truly stupid and uncaring man of appalling ignorance about dogs.There was nothing wrong with this dog that a decent owner with some mental discipline couldn't fix real fast. This owner is a self-indulgent fool, and his dog deserved far better. Pitiful book. Despicable man. There is no point in my repeating what has already been written, so read the 1-star and 2-star reviews.DO NOT buy this book as a gift for any seriously informed dog guy. He will be horrified by the mindlessly ignorant ruination of a good dog herein portrayed. As dog books go, you can't do worse."
2,"Great book, poor edition","This is a great book, capturing the complicated relationship between man and dog. But this edition is very bad. The paper is cheap newsprint, the print is much too small, and the pictures are almost invisible. Spend the money for the hardback edition, which I also have. This purchase was for a gift and disappointing"
4,A great romp,"Probably best reserved for lovers of canines, I thouroughly enjoyed this book. Marley has personality and energy. This book is an easy summer read that is touching and fun."
5,Dog Lover Loves Book,"If you love dogs, if you love human drama or if you just like to laugh than this is the book for you. John Grogan's amazing vocabulary really brings you into the story and makes you feel as though the events are unfolding right in front of you. This is a story not only of the love between humans and their pets, but of what life is really about. No one or dog is truely perfect, live life to the fullest, know when you are wrong and love everyone unconditionally."
4,is a bad dog ever a bad dog?,"good book. not exactly a ""dog book""...more about life's experience's/family/pregnancy/children and Marley is there too. Truly from beginning to end, adoption to old age. Best chapter is authors reflection on dog ownership. 13 years of coming home to a wagging tail etc.. touching"
3,Cute True Story/Quick Read,"This is a very heart warming story and I fell in love with Marley. My hats off to the Grogan Family for their love and devotion to giving Marley such a wonderful life through all the difficulties. Makes you realize that getting a pet is a responsibility not to be taken lightly. I laughed and I cried, anyone that loves animals would enjoy this book."
5,Marley the wonder dog!,"What a great story. I laughed,I cried,I fell in love with Marley! I have three Labs of my own or should say my three own me. This is a love story about a family that is wrapped around Marley The Wonder Dog. You have to read this book if you love any dog or dogs."
5,This was so much more than the tale of a dog,When I picked this up I wanted something fun and light as I knew I had a busy week. Well I couldn't put it down. It was everyday stuff but yet so heartwarming. It was the story of a dog but also of a growing family. It was a story of what is important in life and that moments won't last forever. It was a story of love and commitment and making your mark on someone's heart. Really enjoyed it.
1,Audio CD - Stay away and just buy the book!,"This is a really good story, but the audio cd is terrible. The author also reads the book for the cd. He has one of those nasal, effeminate voices, and after 30 minutes, you want to plug up your ears. If they had only gotten a professional to read it, it would have been perfect. Josh Grogan is a good writer, but has a terrible voice! Just get the book, and get another audio cd to pass the time in your car. This one is not worth the $5 I paid."
4,Enjoyable read,"Marley and Me is a book about relationships - the relationship between people and he relationships between people and pets. These relationships are intermingled in Grogan's tale as well as in life. Relationships go through so many spaces from times of peace and spiritual bonding to times of anguish and pain - both with people and with pets. Grogan shares his relationship experience with us in gentle and easy-flowing prose.My only problem with Marley and Me is most probably my personal tastes. It is a bit heavy on the precious factor. However, it was a quick and enjoyable read that touches the heart."
3,i liked it,i know for us guys ..its hard to admit that we do love these four legged creatures..i held back my tears when i buried my dog 8 years ago....but i couldnt while i was reading the book...there is something you have for your first dog.and yes this is a good narrative about a dog and its antics all dog owners are familiar with..good read must say..
1,Just plain BORING!!!,"Forgetting about what you think of the Grogans' pet care style, this is a bad book because it's poorly written and boring as hell after the first 50 pages. It's predictable, too long, and has essentially NO PLOT. Without spoiling what little thread there is, the book is more like a series of diary entries in the 13 years of Marley's life in the Grogan family. The fact that it is a book much more about the Grogans than Marley would be acceptable if it were interesting, but it's NOT.And for heaven's sake, what happened to the editor? This book should have been shorter by a third, if not cut by half. The writing is so overly explicit as if the reader is seriously dumb and can't understand the slightest insinuation.Bottom line: are people so stupid they like this kind of third gread level of writing? Otherwise, if you like good literature, evocative passages, a good plot, and/or complex characterizations, then don't buy this book--because it isn't happening here."
2,Review of the AUDIO CD- Go for the book instead!,"Even though I have not read the book, I advise you read it rather than listen to it. The author's voice is whiney, even gratingly so; hard to listen to without cringing at times, especially when he half-heartedly attempts to imitate the Irish woman at the B&B, and various other characters. Even though the story is ok(I am a dog fanatic and like pretty much any story involving dogs) it was hard to get past Grogan's voice. Also, and I assume this is because of the fact it is abridged, there are many overused descriptions, and certainly no wit."
1,A waste of money,"I stopped reading at page 90. This book is incredibly boring. I don't know how it became a bestseller. How can a dog lover keep his best friend in a garage? I wanted to read about Marley, not about the author's sex life or his wife's pregnancies (yawn). There are great dog books available -- don't waste your money on this one."
5,"MARLEY AND ME, LIFE AND LOVE WITH THE WORLDS WORST DOG.",THIS BOOK SHOWS HOW DOGS ARE (OR SHOULD BE) A PART OF THE FAMILY. IT IS TRULY HEARTWARMING.
1,"DISAPPOINTMENT, TIMES FIVE","I find dog stories usually inspirational and a credit to their masters. This story left me flat. Retrievers need room to roam about, and they are social and friendly critters. Marley's life was not usually like that. The Grogans should have taken dog obedience classes as well as a lot of lessons in general parenting. Thank goodness I didn't put out the twenty bucks to be irritated and wanting to give the Grogans some worthwhile tips in raising an animal. A dog-owner friend gave me the book to read - she enjoyed it totally. Dogs are a big responsibility and shouldn't be brought home on a whim. For all that, Grogan is a good writer and I enjoyed his work...maybe this one shouldn't have gone public. PS - I have been a dog-owner for many years."
4,A Great Read (Listen),"My husband & I listened to the CD version of this book during a long car trip. Lots of laughs and great visualizations! Many heart felt moments throughout this book as the author chronologically goes through family life with Marley. An expected sad ending, as most animal stories go, but told with love and compassion. A great read (or listen), especially for pet owners."
3,Pretty good book . . .,"Unlike most of the reviews for this book that seemed to either adore it or hate it, I thought the book was just `pretty good.' It did seem a shame that Marley's owners seemed so ill prepared for dog ownership, but I think their hearts were in the right place. Marley wasn't the world's worst dog, and this book isn't the world's best or worst book. It read like a series of newspaper columns, but is fairly well written. I could sympathize with both Marley and the frustrations of his owners. I cried at the ending - there is absolutely no way not to - and overall was glad I read the book."
4,Dull at first but hooks you,"Although you may feel like putting this book down, and never returning, it hooks you by pulling your emotional strings. Anyone who's ever had a dog, or a pet - or known someone with a pet for that matter- can relate to Marley.Great for a quick read"
1,zero stars,"What a sick society we live in when the world's worst dog owner can not only write about his animal neglect and abuse but make a fortune through a nation that lauds his ignorant selfishness as ""amusing"" and ""heart-warming."" Oh, and his wife? She repays this dog's love and loyalty with a beating. The text includes very little material about Marley other than his abuse yet drones on and on about how the owners want children. PLEASE DON'T SUPPORT THESE IGNORANT, UTTERLY SELF-ABSORBED, PEOPLE. DON'T BUY THE BOOK."
1,I can relate,"I just lost my beloved Golden in November so when I read this over the holidays, I could have sworn it was written about my Cody Jasper. I laughed and cried as predicted and it was good to be able to laugh at the memories. Thanks for writing this book....It helped me in my grief tremendously!!!!"
3,A book for Lab owners to read - especially before getting a lab,"I enjoyed the book but was saddened by some of the stories/tales by the owner. I spoil my dogs (labs) rotten, and I therefore assume most other owners do as well, but I felt some of the incidents by the owner, broke my heart (older Marley trying to get over the snowbanks to get to the woods/tree to go to the bathroom, the going up and down the stairs with difficutly, etc.) The owner could have done a few things to make Marley's life easier.It was very easy reading and brought a smile to my face on many a time, but only true dog lovers would really like to read this book."
2,Maybe even the world's worst book...,"To be fair, I never finished this book. Who knows? It could have really picked up after page 13.But unless you can deal with ""Jen-Jen"" and John's soft-focus romance in ""the pulsing ethnic stew of South Florida"" (hey, you CAN get Jamaican Jerk AND cuban coffee there), and Jen-Jen saying naff things like, ""You're a cutie-wootie-woo, Marley!"", you won't make it much farther.The dog on the cover, though, is bee-yoo-tiful."
5,Relatable experiences abound...,"The trials and tribulations of owning a not-so-heavenly dog are condensed and laid out in this novel. Anyone who has a dog, has owned a dog, or wants to own one needs to read this book about the humorous (though seemingly not at the time) things that can and has gone wrong with this particular dog owner and his family. Just when you think it can't go more wrong with this dog owner, it does, but it's those times that help him bond with this unlikely family member.Many dog owners can relate with the antics put up with this yellow lab, and like this book, you find yourself bonding with Mark and his dog, and make those with pets think their dogs aren't that bad.Highly recommended."
3,NOT for someone who has recently been through the same thing with their pet!!!,"I was very much looking forward to reading this book. I guess I was hoping for more of a ""comforting"" book since we had very recently had to have our own, 16 yr. old, much-loved cat put to sleep. I reached thepart where Marley's health was deteriorating & made the mistake of looking ahead & reading. I was overcome by emotion & was crying so hard I stopped reading. I know that all pet's live's have to end, & I realize I am VERY sentamental when it comes to my own. I remember once coming across one of our cat's in the middle of a street after he had been hit. I was very young--maybe 12 yrs. old. I ran back home to tell my mom & when I finally got settled down enough, she took me to school. During that day, I found myself crying & wondering why the recent death of my grandma hadn't had this same affect on me. I felt guilty.I have not picked up ""Marley & Me"" since the day I put it down.That is my own perspective of this book."
5,Marley and Me,"Great book for animal- or people-lovers! Humor, pathos, articulate expression, a delight!"
2,Get rich off your dead dog!,"A ""true"" story about two yuppies who buy a dog because they think it will be good ""training"" for them when they have kids and it goes from there. The dog is incredibly destructive and seemingly untrainable. I have been around dogs my whole life and never seen one that behaves bad enough to even be comparable to this one. I am normally the worlds biggest sucker for a dog story but I really didn't care for this. The humor seemed a bit forced and while it is always sad when a dog dies the ending seemed contrived. To be honest I think the author loosely based this on reality with the thought of massive book sales and a movie deal in mind from the beginning. For great dog stories I recomend Call of the Wild, White Fang or Where the Red Fern Grows."
5,Best book in ages,This is the second time in my life I have writen an author...I LOVE THIS BOOK!...I laughed and cried and loved every word...so did my dogsLee Lee Applin
4,Fantastic Story for Dog Lovers,"For those who have willingly dealt with the enjoyment and agony of caring for a playful yet ill-behaved dog, this book is for you. Marley & me is the true story of the Grogan family and their dog Marley, a rambunctious white Labrador. John Grogan tells the family story beginning when they brought Marley home as a puppy and encompassing many hilarious and amazing stories along the way.I found this book personally enjoyable as it reminded me that my family is not alone in dealing some of the insanity that goes with pet ownership. Between Marley's training, constant battle of wills, and his impact on all members of the Grogan family, this book covers it all and will leave you laughing, cringing, or crying throughout the story.I recommend Marley & Me to all dog lovers, but caution that it is as heart wrenching as it is appealing."
4,Me?,"I must agree with a previous reviewer....I was wondering where Marley was going to come in and it seemed a tale about the author...however Marley does eventually make an appearance, and a lovable rascal he is too when he appears.Kinda funny...not as funny in my opinion as the 'British' Marley and Me, which is a bit more eccentric ( as you would expect from a British guy!) and in my view a lot more 'laugh out loud' with the tales of his Labrador called Barney or maybe it's just me? ( Shakespeare My B*tt! by John Donoghue)Don't get me wrong, Marley and Me is still a great homegrown read - and what a cute photo."
5,Heartwarming and true to life!,"Anyone who has owned a dog, lab or not, will revel in this wonderfully told story about Marley. You will laugh, cry & cringe at Marley's antics as he blesses and challanges the Grogan's on a daily basis. A super quick read, this book will suck you in in the first paragraph. Dog owners everywhere should read this book!"
1,Glorified nasty behavior,"I am shocked at the number of 5 star reviews this joke of a book has. Did people read the same book I did? Where the owners basically abused their dog because he was reacting to THEM not meeeting it's needs? Sorry but it's not a dogs bad behavior if it is not cared for properly or not given enough exercise. They should have gotten a fish. Grogan's wife sounds like a selfish, self centered harpy. She should be ashamed of herself. Disneyworld is more important then a dying animal you claim to love so much. OH and punching the dog because your depressed. If you punch a child, even if you're depressed, it's a crime. To bad it isn't a crime to abuse a dog. Not sure how this translates into a feel good tale.People like the Grogan's make me sick."
2,Boring! More about human relationships than dog.,"I am so disappointed. Why:1. I expected so much from this book based on the amazon reviews.2. This book was composed of around 70% human relationships/wife/baby issues.3. The doggy issues he described were normal, nothing that unusual.4. I was actually mad at him for not understanding some dog behavior. For example, when his dog went deaf, the author did not understand that the reason the dog came for dinner was his sensitive nose, not his ability to hear the owner pounding the floor with his foot.5. The only part of the book I liked was the end, because it made me cry. I only finished the book because I wanted to see if anything unusual ever did happen. It did make me more aware of what to expect when my dog gets older.Overall Conclusion: Boring and somewhat maddening for those of us who are more in touch with dogs."
3,Marley & Me,"The book is a wonderful reminder of the joys and pains of owning a dog. However, I could not believe that the Grogans would allow their beloved Marley to suffer for so long before doing the right thing. I cried at the part where Marley couldn't get up the steps because of his arthritic legs and his owner just stood on the porch and called him until he dragged himself up. The rest of the book has more examples. What family would go on an extended vacation and leave a sick, weak dog in a kennel. Granted, the kennel was connected to a vet's office, but the results were devastating...and still they let him suffer. I know, as a pet owner, how hard it is to make the decision of euthanasia, but when your animal is so crippled or otherwise impaired, it's time for that hard decision. To postpone is cruelty."
5,A Must Read For All Dog Lovers,"This is the story of Marley, an exuberant yellow Labrador retriever and his people John and Jenny Grogen. It is a very well written book and tells of Marley's life from puppyhood to his last days. I laughed and cried (I sobbed uncontrollably at the end of chapter 6). Our family has been blessed with three labs over the years and it was easy to relate to many of Marley's adventures. There was a little more about Grogen's life than I was expecting, but it was interesting and didn't detract from the life of Marley. This is a must read for all dog lovers."
5,It's A Keeper!!,"I bought this book with the intention of reading it, and then trying to sell it on Ebay. That didn't happen!! I put this on my shelf of books to keep. I absolutely loved this book and had a hard time putting it down! It made laugh and made me cry, and brought back memories of dogs I've owned thru the years and their antics. It especially made me think a lot of my beloved lab, Jake, who just went to doggie heaven a few months ago, and made me long for another Lab. This book captured the essence of living with and loving a big old oaf of a dog. I think any dog lover will see bits of their own dogs in this story and should find it an amusing story, especially those who believe that our animals aren't disposable."
3,good book,"This was a good book, family oriented to me. I liked it but thought it would actually be more centered around the dog, Marley, rather than the whole family. And I don't believe any dog is any worse than his owner (or his owner's training of the animal). I had read another review and bought this book because it sounded so good. Guess I was looking for a good heartwarming dog story."
2,Boring read,"Hi. This book seems to get the attention of animal lovers and owners but it probably would appeal more to people who like animals but don't live with them. I'm sure Marley was a wonderful member of the Grogan family but this pooch was sedate compared to tales I could tell you about my own animals. I was hoping for something more engaging and entertaining. I found it difficult to finish (I forced myself) I was left with asking, ""and then what happened? That's it??"" I met a woman on vacation who was reading it and I asked her how she liked it - she said, ""I keep waiting for something interesting to happen."" I guess that summed it up."
1,So....????,"I am definitely in the minority here, or so it seems, by giving this book so low a rating. Anyone who has ever owned a puppy or dog am sure can relate to what the writer relates. We've gone through it all. And because we have, Grogan adds nothing new or interesting to the saga. This is a humorless, boring, ill-written long essay about nothing new under the sun. What's Grogan's next book: ""Stoned: The Pet Rock Owner's Manual""? ""Knitting My Way Through Suburbia?"" I can't wait!"
1,Give me a break,This author is the most arrogant person. I was so excited to buy this book because I love animals. The preface of this book turned me off from the beginning because of the authors remarks on older dogs at the pound (being someone else's charity). This man is horrible. All dogs are good and deserved to be loved. You are missing out on the true love of any creature include people. I am sorry I ever bought this book and sorry for all the animals that give their unconditional love to this idiot.
4,Marley and Me,"I haven't finished reading this book, but so far it is very good. I bought a pure bred white/yellow lab a year ago, and have gone thru some of the very same issues that Grogan went thru. So knowing that I'm not the only one who has ever dealt with these issues gave me more understanding and patience. I don't think my girl is quite as bad as Marley, but she comes real close! I can definitely relate!"
4,"Marley and Me, what you'd expect","Easy to read, sweet, as expected, an Everyman's jouney with his trusty sidekick. I enjoyed it but wouldn't recommend it particularly."
3,Good,"A lot of tears, that's what this book let me. Amazing story full of sentiment and emotion. A a a"
3,A good read for dog lovers,"Delightful and entertaining, this book is indeed like cuddling up with a little lab puppy. I still can't play Bob Marley without picturing this cute little naughty dog."
5,Marley and Me,"As an animal lover, and a dog lover at that, the book rates 5 stars. If you ever owned a dog, you will identify with some part, if not the entire book.I found myself after finishing 'Marley and Me' giving each of my dogs a long and loving hug.Touching at the end, laughable and so many truisms at the beginning and middle.Super!"
2,not what I expected,I was disappointed with the Audio CD because it did not follow the book verbatim and my students had difficulty following. Is there a CD that will follow the book????
1,stop this book,"this book is unreadible. it's horrible! i bought it because of the cute cover and i love dogs, but the writing is soooooo bad and the stories of the dog are soooooo ordinary. the author goes way too much into his own boring life that has nothing to do with the dog. the writing is from a newspaper guy from south florida and it feels like it... it's full of cliche's and very flat jokes. it's unbearable. stop this book..."
2,How NOT to Raise a Dog,"A dog dominating his cowed humans. A poor excuse for an obedience trainer. Lessons that should have been learned in puppyhood ignored or not even considered.If this dog had been a human child it would have been on Ritalyn and in intensive therapy -- but no it's ""just"" a dog and his vices are considered irritating, bearable and sometimes cute.I didn't find this book amusing or interesting at all."
4,something we all can relate to,"I haven't read the entire book yet, though I did read an excerpt and a review in one of the local Philadelphia papers and what I've read of the book, it's definitely a book worth reading. Marley reminds me much of a St. Bernard I know. They must be kindred spirits!"
3,Marley The Blog,"I think it's a good book, but it confirms John Grogan is most obviously a column writer. This book could have easily been a concatenation of newspaper columns about Grogan's family during the 15-odd years of Marley's life. It could have easily been a (well-written) blog.Grogan has put to paper what every other (caring) dog owner has gone through, in one way or another. From that great dog we all had when we were kids, to the crazy things our puppies did as we raised our family, to the trials our dogs went through as they got older. He put to page the loss we have when our canine family member goes to doggy heaven, and our lives go on, never to forget our beloved friend, through the good and the bad."
5,best,This was the best book ever written... a page Turner... I laughed and cried... ten star book... Marley's is an inspiration
4,Sweet,"This is a nice book about a subject that is dear to my heart, Labrador Retrievers. They really are great family members.If you enjoyed this and are inclined I would highly recommend ""Bashan and I"" by Thomas Mann, an eminent wordsmith. It's much better written and covers similar subject matter. And, that's not to knock Mr. Grogan, Thomas Mann is after all a Nobel Laureate."
1,"If you truly love this book, don't get a dog!","The most disturbing information is why these clods picked a labrador retriever. I wonder if they did more research about having kids than they did in selecting a labrador retriever. It's true that labrador retrievers are the most popular dog in the United States. They are also the SECOND MOST EUTHANIZED dog due to idiots like this. So many labs show up at shelters that the sheer numbers cause them to be labeled ""unadoptable"", even for many no-kill shelters. People get labs only to ""discover"" that they don't have time or patience to take care of them. So they dump them at a shelter and wash their hands of the problem. Have a heart and do a little research before you adopt a pet to find out just how much ""trouble"" it will require. If you don't have the time, don't get the pet. Unfortunately, I fear this book will only encourage the popularity of labs and perpetuate the problem."
4,"A light, fun read...","This is a great book for just picking up and reading a couple of chapters whenever you can find the time. You can set it down for a few weeks and then pick right up where you left off without any trouble. The author really does a great job capturing Marley's personality on paper and expressing his whirlwind of emotions that come with the joys (and frustrations) of dog ownership. Like others have mentioned, this book did bring a smile to my face often and caused me to chuckle aloud a few times.I gave this book four stars because there was a peppering of foul language in it and the use of the Lord's name in vain a few times. I realize that this book is geared toward adults and not children, but I still find these things offensive. If it were not for some of the language (though it contained fewer occurences than many other books I have read), I would have easily rated this five stars."
5,True Love,"I received this book on Friday and had it finished by Saturday night...being an avid dog lover, I found myself relating to the author in quite a few of Marley's antics. Like many readers, I laughed and I cried and it brought back many memories of when I had to put my own lab down due to health problems brought on by 'backyard in-breeding'. (and yes, my next dog was a 6 year old rescue form the Humane Society)One thing I truly don't understand of the author -- if you love your dog so much, why would you put him through YEARS of being barely able to walk? Just because they don't hold up a sign that says ""HEY MISTER - THIS HURTS"" doesn't mean they aren't in pain. I see that as a selfish owner who needs to think of what is best for the animal and not himself. Like many readers agree, poor Marley should have been put down long before he was. That's love."
3,Cute but over rated,"I read this book last night. Yes, its a cute story but I think it is way over rated. Pretty much everyone in life has a pet they love and has stories about it. This book just seems to be about one families life and their dog. I didn't think there was anything magical or tremendous going on in the book where it deserved to have a movie made. But the good news is that if he can be this big of a success then so can anyone!Really its a story a man's life with his family and some funny things his dog does.Doesn't everyone have those?"
2,A few laughs,"This was recommended to me and I thought, ""okay, why not?"" Now I know why not....a few chuckles and that is all. Where have GOOD books gone to? Does anyone know?"
5,Heartwarming...,"This book was a joyful read. Full of fond memmories and happy times, Marley is the ultimate Lab. As a Lab owner, I could not put this book down, and even found myself crying at the end. Marley And Me takes you through the life of a hysterical dog. I strongly reccomend this book to anyone!"
5,John Grogan is a fantastic storyteller!,"This is a light-hearted, must-read for anyone with a dog or just a love for them. Having a dog with a similar personality to Marley, I found myself laughing out loud as I thought, ""Yep. That sounds all too familiar.""I couldn't wait to read what happened next. Thanks so much for sharing your story!"
4,majestic marley,i cant belive all the losers who dont like this book! its a very cute book and its going to be a very good movie ha ha ha
5,A great story for all dog lovers and owners,"A great story full of laughs,tears and everything else that runs in life. This book is a must read for all dog owners and lovers. When I started to read this I thought will I like it or wont I but when you countinue to read it you get addicted in the story and wont be able to put it down. The dog is so funny espesically when they got kicked out of dog obediense classes( it's funny becouse we took our dog to classes and she was bad). The book is funny and heartwarming. You think the book ios about the dog but it's not it alsoa bout life shown in a typicall american family through there ups and downs in life. Overall I loved it and it's a must read."
5,Marley and Me,"I just love this book, I adopted a Lab when he was 1 1/2 years old and as my husband says here's your sign ""Free to a good home"" there is no such thing a good dog for free!! He has stolen our hearts. Well reading John's book could be my story of Buddy and now that I am a owner of a Lab I have spoken to many others and find that many of the traits are common to the bred. The book is well written and enjoyable to read."
1,How NOT to Treat a Dog,"I agree with so many others who were disturbed by this book. Is Mr. Grogan an educated man? Really? He didn't even consider neutering Marley until the vet told him he should and even then he was reluctant. With millions of unwanted dogs wasting away in animal shelters, why on earth would anyone be reluctant to neuter their dog?He stated that he liked this vet because he believed the man ""maintained a healthy sensibility about a dog's role in the human world."" Huh? You mean like being locked up in a garage all day alone? Is that a dog's ""role""?I believe that many Americans - like Grogan - think they love dogs when really they see them more as a form of entertainment. They are living, breathing creatures equal to human beings in the suffering (and joy) that they can feel.Grogan exaggerates Marley's ""bad"" behavior for laughs, but when you look at how Marley was mistreated in so many instances, there's nothing funny about it at all."
4,Pretty good,Heartwarming..... Kinda makes me want to get a puppy but Im hesitant because I know my heart will break when I lose it. Its a reminder of what animals teach us. They are angels in disguise.
5,Marley is a must read,Anyone thinking of getting a Lab should read this book. Lab's are the best but I swear there's Goat in thier DNA. Reading Marley and me reminded me of the joy my Choc Lab Hershey had brought us. His love and understanding made it easy to open our home to two rescue dogs who are also Lab breeds.
4,Marley & Me: Life and love with the worst dog,Nice light story especially for dog lovers. Could be shared with your family.
1,Poor Marley,"I also have a Lab. He's not perfect, but I love him dearly anyway. He loves me even though I am not perfect either. I could never imagine writing a book that so arrogantly points out every single flaw and behavior problem I have with a dog who loves me so completely and unconditionally. This author is an idiot and his wife is a selfish shrew. Poor, poor Marley. No animal deserves the condescending expose' that this dog got. Any real dog lover should agree that John Grogan should be ashamed of himself and never abuse another dog with his presence."
2,"Marley and Me not really a good ""dog tale""","Surely no one can resist the picture of the cute puppy on the book cover. Reader beware, this is not really a warm and fuzzy dog story. While Mr. Grogan is a talented writer, dog lovers may feel a bit cheated reading Marley&Me. It seems the author was more intent about writing his own memoirs than writing a tribute to his beloved dog. Many of the stories regarding Marley are merely typical experiences any dog owner has shared. If you are looking for a more sincere and heartwarming dog tale, read ""Amazing Gracie"":A Dog's Tale written by the owners of Three Dog Bakery."
1,Cruel Humans,"Terrible book. I wish I had not read it! This book is not about dogs, but about the life of a mean-spirited, self centered, materialistic couple. J. Grogan knows absolutely nothing about dogs. Marley deserved love and understanding. He was a typical Lab. They are full of fun. Marley needed puppytraining. Instead Grogan used cruel abusive methods, read page 144-145, beatings!!!Marley lived a long life, but in the final years he was in so much pain, he cried trying to get up and lie down. Grogan writes that he had not realized Marley's hips were that bad. Wouldn't the crying have been an indication to bring the dog to the Vet?And do you leave a dying dog at a kennel and go to Disneyland?This is the worst human possible!!"
1,superficial trifle of a book,"since a less than one star review is not allowed, this book gets the single star for the cute cover picture of the dog. that's the only redeeming quality this paltry, overrated book has. this book is touted as being ideal for dog lovers which is nonsense since no love of dogs is displayed anywhere in the book. the biography is really about a family of boring mediocrities who just happen to own a dog. the dog crops up in the story once in a while when it does something grogan or his wife are displeased with and one gets the impression that marley is nothing but a frustrating burden to them. after reading half of this book i was convinced grogan was incapable of having a loving relationship with marley or any other dog and felt angry at being taken in by all the brain dead, extravagant, gushing reviews here. check this one out at the library if you must read it and save yourself the expense."
2,Over Rated Book,"I have just finished this book and found it to be a predictablecliche. The fact that the writer is proud of the decisions he and his wife made while raising this dog is simply sad.I am afraid of this books popularity this story is not cute or funny. This dog deserved better but, true to a dogs nature Marley remained loyal till the end."
3,even a non-dog owner knows that...,"With a particularly neurotic pet, the owner should not force the dog to suffer through an airplane flight. It sickens me that the author & his wife did not think to have one of them drive (with a child or two?) from Florida to Pennsylvania, knowing the dog would be more comfortable in the car, even though the trip would be a long one. Poor Marley.Parts made me teary, other parts made me angry that a dog would be treated the way Marley was. I can't decide if I like the book or not."
5,Marley & Me,"A very Entertaining book, great read. This is a must book for all those that have a dog as a pet or all dog lovers, especially those of us that have had labs in our life. A laugh out loud cry out loud story."
5,Loved It!,"I loved this book. The author shares real moments in his family's life that we can relate to. His love for Marley is never questioned. This book is especially fitting for those of us who have a not-so-well-mannered dog, but love 'em anyway!! This book had me laughing out loud (misery loves company) and crying too. Any dog lover will enjoy this story."
2,"Yuppie ""practice baby""","I felt bad for the dog, especially the way he spent his last days. The owners made my skin crawl with their utterly selfish ways. That said, the actual writing was very good. I can see how this author is a successful journalist."
2,Meh,"Having raised several Labradors from puppyhood to senescence, I was quite taken by Marley's hilarious and ultimately tragic tale. Grogan perfectly describes the incredible stubbornness and insanity of a Labrador's temperament. As for the rest of the book: I'm sure in the author's mind, the story of the his marriage/family/career is inseparable from the story of his dog, but... it was totally self-absorbed and utterly banal. His thoughts on mortality and the legacy of 9/11 were one of the most trite, sentimental, unoriginal things I have ever read. He'd do well writing for the NYPost."
5,Loving a Lab is not always easy!,"This book was given to me as a joke really. Afterall, I have the world's worst dog! Marley & Me is a MUST for any dog lover, especially if you have ever owned a Lab. I laughed aloud many, many times throughout this book, and found it very hard to put down. A wonderful story of love, frustration, and man's best friend. A great gift!"
5,A Delightfully Fun Read,"I loved the antics of this wonderfully flawed doggie and recognized some traits in my own beloved dog. Author Grogan does a wonderful job telling his story. The bond between him and Marley, I'm convinced is universal among the dog lovers of the world.They touch the spirit and soul of man. Is it any wonder that dog spelled backwards is God?"
5,The Best of animals as family,"This book had me laughing so hard it hurt and crying like I lost Marley. Mr. Grogan captured the true essence of having a dog in the family, as a family member. As you read this book, you really get to know Marley and his family. It is the best animal family book I have ever read. And it makes you realize that your animal really isn't alone! A must for anyone who wants to read a great book!!!"
3,Not as engaging as I'd hoped,"I hesitated reading this book as I thought I'd be put through an emotional wringer for sure. Since I have a dog, I wasn't particularly anxious to experience that unavoidable pain. However, the book didn't engage me as I'd expected it to and I couldn't relate to the masochistic bent of Marley's owners. The writing style was very casual, like the author was sitting across from me relating his experiences with Marley. I understand his attachment and dedication to his pet. But I have to admit I found myself bored at many points in the story and almost abandoned it before the end, which I never do."
5,Must read for animal lovers.,"You never know what you're going to get with a dog or a book, and this was no exception. When my friend saw this book in my car she immediately advised me against reading it. She claimed it was ""Too sad."" This book wasn't sad, it was a true celebration of life. From the viewpoint of someone cursed with horrible (but lovable) family pets, everything Grogan wrote was perfectly on point. A great read for anyone, this book will be truly appreciated by an animal lover."
5,"I laughed, I cried, I loved this book!!","I read Marley and Me during a car trip to Boston this week. I couldn't put it down. As an animal lover, and someone who has had her share of ""bad"" dogs, I could really relate to the author's experiences with Marley. When my dog Darby passed away there were many people who could not understand why I felt such terrible grief for such a long time. The idea that dogs are not people exists to make us doglovers feel that we shouldn't love quite as deeply as we do. Grogan's book made me feel like it's ok to admit that Darby's death hurt more than the deaths of some of the people I've known. Call me crazy-but at least I now know I've got company. And that company can write, too! I recommend this book to anyone who loves animals."
4,Marley & Me,"I'm a dog lover and like to read books about people and their relationships with dogs. I really enjoyed this book, although I could have done without all the details of them trying to get pregnant. Marley & Me is a funny, sad, and an ultimately satisfying read, and I have recommended it to my dog loving friends."
4,If you are thinking of getting a dog this is a book for you,"This is a great book for dog lovers but I also think it is one for those thinking about getting a dog. It describes how much emotion we animal lovers go through from hole digging, shoe chewing and then when pets get ill and need expensive life saving medical care. While I may have disagreed with the way The Grogan's made decisions about Marley, in the end it was well worth the read for anyone who loves a well written story with heart."
2,"Well written book about the Grogan Family, and how they know very little about dog ownership","After reading this book I came to the following conclusions:-John Grogon is a great writer. He managed to ""keep my attention"" through a book that is really about his wife and dog-The fact that he admitted to some of the ""training"" techniques he used on this dog tells me that he has STILL not invested time into learning how to bring up a dog.-The overall ratings of this book prove that most dog owners are just as clueless as the Grogans.With all that said, I do understand that he loved his dog and I admire him for writing a book about him.When I became a first time dog owner,I bought 3 dog training books, 2 medical books for dogs, 1 book on the breed and signed up for training classes. It is very obvious that the Grogons did not take dog ownership this seriously."
4,A story about love and friendship,"This is not simply a story about a goofy dog but one about mutual devotion and true friendship. Marley, like most dogs, starts as a pet but gradually becomes an integral part of the newlywed family. Grogan makes an important point that life should be enjoyed to the fullest and that a life restrained by rules and ""what is right"" is far less fulfilling. This is a book you will never forget and I hope the movie lives up to the spirit in which this book is written."
5,well worth reading,Will make you and laugh and cry within minutes of each other. A thoroughly enjoyable read.
1,Like watching a bad sitcom....,"A book about a guy and a dog. Far from original, the dysfunctional descriptions of the human/animal relationships had me quickly putting this book down.Do yourself a favor. Skip this one."
2,Should have been a magazine article,"Overlong, not always about Marley, and sometimes just plain boring.Here's a synopsis of the book: Marley is a destructive dog; the owner/author can't control him; but as with most dog owners, we love them anyway. Oh, and my wife is giving birth to two kids and we're bringing them into a house that has almost been destroyed by this slobbering hound."
2,World's Worst Yuppie,"If this book tempts you because you love big goofy dogs, but you suspect it may be 289 pages of mush-brained goo, here's my advice: Trust your instincts.First, Marley is by far not the world's worst dog. He's well within one standard deviation of the norm for male American Labs.The author, on the other hand, is a columnist for a regional (read ""not major"") Florida newspaper. Three times a week, he has to troll his trivial life for 250 words, and viola! We have ""Marley and Me"". You get intimate details of his marriage and efforts at home decor along with his rabid recounting of every time his dog ate poop. Trust me. If you found yourself trapped in a corner with this guy at a cocktail party, you'd suddenly realize you need to run out and check whether you rolled your car windows up.Marley was a nice and worthy dog. There are lots of nice dogs. Fortunately, most of their owners are not provincial hacks."
4,Couldn't put it down,"Life and love with the world's worst dog. A New York Times bestseller, Marley & Me, written by John Grogan is fantastic. When John was just a boy, he had the most amazing dog ever. Now he is a grown man with a young wife. Wanting a baby, they are not sure they are ready. So they decide to get a puppy, Marley. That was probably the worst decision, but in other ways it was the best.I enjoyed this book so much. I just couldn't put it down. This book is full of joyfulness, love, and man is it crazy! Like when the Grogan's try to put Marley in dog training school, well that was not the best idea. Marley got kicked out!I would recommend this book to middle school students and animal lovers of all kinds. I would even suggest this book to adults. It is for anyone who is in the mood for a good laugh. Not only is it interesting and funny, but it also shows that a wondorously neurotic dog can change a family's life forever.-Lauren Price-"
5,A dog for the ages,"This book is so wonderful, he reminds me of my dogs, had me in tears at the end and all the way through it just was great, couldn't put it down till I finished it."
5,Who couldn't love this face?,"I have a Marley (actually a Charley, and she can get into more mischief in five minutes than both my grown children ever got into during their 2's & 3's together). But when she looks up at you with that big dumb lab look and her tongue hanging out on the side, how can you not love her?This book was written for everyone who ever wondered at some point ""Maybe I should just give up. Owning a dog just shouldn't be this hard!"" This is the book that gives them the answer to that question."
5,I am giving this book to all my dog-loving friends.,Wonderful Book! I love the journalistic writing style. The story is just wonderful. I laughed out loud so many times that I lost count. I also cried.Thank you Mr. Grogan.
4,What a darling story this is!!,"If you own a pet, you will love reading this amazingly hilarious story about a loving, nuerotic dog. I owned a wonderful cat that just passed on at 19 years old. I also have 2 chihuahuas that don't know they are dogs, and this book reminded me of them so very much.All of the little tidbits that make up this book are so true to the ownership of a family dog......the choosing of its name to the teaching of obiedience to the dilemma of the family vacation and even the addition of a new baby.This book is fun. Its touching. Reading this story was refreshing. This book made me laugh and made me cry. Thank you Mr. Grogan for sharing this part of your life with all of us.If you own a dog, you will want to read this book. If you don't own a dog and read this book, you will want to own a dog and have that special dependent, independent love a wonderful pet can give you.B Harris"
3,Dog Lover,I love dogs but this book is not for every dog-lover. I could not wait for it to be over. The author's accent is distracting and there were lots of words with no real content.
5,Marley & Me,I absolutely loved this book. Marley's behavoir echoes my own dogs behavior. (or at least the parts about destroying everything when left alone) Its nice to see I dont have the only crazy pooch out there!!
5,I loved it!,This was one of the best books I have ever read! Having a 13 year old lab myself made this book that much more meaningful. Grogan's description of life with Marley hit so close to home that I found myself laughing out loud(quite frequently) and crying (almost inconsolably at times). I would highly recommend this book to dog owners and dog lovers alike.
3,"Okay book, better movie","I didn't think I'd ever say this, but I actually liked the movie of Marlie & Me better than the book. Usually it's the other way around. The book contains a great story and is written (over all) quite well. But it does get a little slow at times and seems to be way overhyped. I went into it with way too high of expectations. Keep your expectations in check and go into this book with an open mind. And then watch the movie!"
3,doggie drama,"Picked this up at the library and would recommend it. Half the books I pull out of the library I give up reading if it doesn't fulfill my personal taste with its story, and there was a moment 50 pages in, I was ready to give up on this family and dog drama, but I'm glad I stuck with it. It has a heart-wrenching ending that works.After reading the negative reviews concerning Grogan's (mis)handling of Marley, I think those reviews are making some good points I didn't fully consider when I read this book. On the other hand I feel the Grogan's are typical pet owners. Well meaning people, who could use more common sense and knowledge on pet ownership."
5,"Touching, Funny, Great Book!","I loved this book and laughed out loud many times. The sentamental irony of love at all cost, even when the furniture gets chewed is touching. It's good to see more people love their family pets, and treat them like the family that they are."
5,just what the Doctor ordered,"I need help...I'm a self confessed Labrador addict.I can't get enough of the our furry friends....and along comes just what the Doctor ordered in the form of 2 great Lab books...Marley and Me (John Grogan) and Shakespeare My Butt! (John Donoghue)As this is a Marley review, I'll concentrate on that book.well...what can I say? It is just wonderful. Captures the bond between human and dog.Will make you laugh...will make you cry...and get a Lab if you haven't already got one!Warning: this may start you on the road to Labrador addiction ...and it's a wonderful addiction to have...and the treatment is hilarious!"
1,*Overrated* would be too large of a compliment,"Let me first say that this book had its touching moments, especially if you had or have a dog. You can relate to the happiness and sadness that a dog brings to your life. However, I do not believe this book contained enough material to warrant more than John Grogan's original newspaper column; he should have left it at that. Out of respect to the kind readers on Amazon, I will continue the review as a reply to this thread as to prevent any ""spoilers"". To those who have finished the book, please click on the `Comments' link and feel free to respond with any feedback."
5,Best Dog Related Book Ever,I never cry. Yet I couldn't get through this book without crying like a 4 year old. I think my wife is still laughing at me. That's how well written and heartfelt this book is. I learned to love Marey without ever meeting him.Marley was a great dog. This is a great book. I can't wait for the movie.
4,The story is plain awesome,"Marley and Me is a remarkable story of man and the love and trust of dog. I enjoyed every chapter of it. It is so hilarious and easy to relate to by any dog owner that has or had a dog of character. The author came close to Jack London in bringing out the character in the dog and does something extraordinary in the dog's domestic nature or exploits.Unlike the dog story in The Usurper and Other stories or the plight of Jack London's dogs--White Fang , Call of the Wild etc, John Morgan's gripping story also teaches us how to give unconditional love to man's best. friend."
5,I'm tempted to FRAME this book... it's wonderful!,"Grogan's account of his life with clumsy and enthusiastic Marley the Yellow Lab is absolutely superb. The writing is wonderful... witty and articulate. I am generally not a fan of non-fiction, but I couldn't put this one down. Grogan had me laughing out loud more times than not, but I won't deny that there are a few tears gracing the pages as well.If you are a big dog owner or just a big dog lover, you must read this book. If you're more of a chihuahua person... well, you just might want to leave it on its proverbial shelf."
4,"Cute and heartfelt, A dog owner's delight","Anyone who's ever owned a dog will relate to this tale. But more importantly, those who've never owned one will find something heartwarming and delightful. This tale shows how sometimes the most important things in life are the people around you, love, family and living in the moment...enjoying the simple things."
5,I love this book 1000000 stars from me,"I don't care who you are read this book, I have cried and laughed so hard, and you Will to. Thank you John grogan for sharing Marley with me"
3,"An interesting primer, but lacking","This book is definitely worthwhile as a kind of ""rainy Saturday morning"" read. It has some interesting information, but overall it doesn't contain enough to really make you feel like you have a handle on the different beings the author covers. This is a book I would recommend to someone who has a passing interest in this kind of stuff and is looking for something quick & simple. I don't really believe in alot of things the author does, but I still like reading about other ideas on how the world works.The author's arrogant and condescending attitude towards scientific ""laws"" (author's quotation marks) is very annoying, especially in the section where he discusses the Hmong. He comes off as a whiny know-it-all who wants you to know how unevolved you are if you place any stock in scientific theory."
3,Not bad....,"As a seasoned paranormal (spirit) investigator, I am beginning to get involved in the realm of ""monsters"". With that being said, I figured this would be the perfect book to get me started. I don't know what it is about this book, but it is very hard for me to keep my focus on it. It is not as if it is poorly written, I just had a very hard time continuing reading it. Some parts are too drawn out while others are skimmed over. I understand that the author is very knowledgable in the field of magic but please ""dumb"" it down a bit for those who have no clue what you are talking about. I had the feeling that this book is not written for beginners,but for those who are ""magically inclined""."
5,Cover Doesn't Do This Book Justice,I have read a few of John Michael Greer's books and let me tell you: the cover on this book does not do it justice. This book is fascinating. It contains an absolute treasure trove of information. Perfect for anyone with any interest in the Paranormal and/or Magickal/Legendary Creatures. Highly recommended!!!
2,This is not what I expected,I think that this book is very breif on the discussion of data structures. I am currently taking a course in Data Structures and I guess If you are looking for a book that just defines Data Structures but If you want to get an in depth knowledge on how the actual structures work and look I would certainly not recommend this book.
2,A basic qualitative book for data structures but that is it.,"I am currently taken a Data Structures course and this is the textbook being used at the university. The book gives basic qualitative understanding of data structures. The answers to the questions and excersizes at the end of each chapter are missing {at least provide the answers to odd ones like other texts}. Standard Templates are given however, Microsoft Visual C++ products do no compile examples without some tweaking. This book seems to be geared to the Borland compiler. The are errors in the coding and text explainations. The authur uses the same name for functions and iterators in the examples which makes learning a little more difficult. I using another book to augment my learning."
2,This book needs some work,"This book is in dire need of major revisions. The example programs (the list class especially) do not compile without the reader revising the code quite a bit. As a textbook, the start of the book is quite a good one. It is good how the author describes how you can implement data structures using the boiled-down versions of the STL classes. However, this method breaks down soon as the author moves into more complex data structures: trees, sets, etc. The book tends to spend more time dealing with explaining how you can widdle around in STL than to delve into the basis and use of the fundamental data structures. If you are looking for a good reference on how to program using the STL, look elsewhere. Much of the book deals with the author's version of the STL than the (Un-?)Standard Template Library."
1,No good!,"This book did provide some usefull expamples of C++ STL, but overall it is the worst C++ book I have ever read! I only have it because it was the required text for my Data Structures class. The Index is worthless! Many poor explanitions! There are fare better books out there for STL."
4,"Not much about STL, but a good book on C++ data structures","If you're looking for specifics about STL, then look onto another text. However I did find that this is one of the better books that describe data structures in an informative way and also backed up with easy to understand and decently designed classes (surprisingly I have found many of the code for other data structure books to be poorly written and obtuse). Doesn't go discuss some of the more interesting data structures such as RB trees, etc. If they come up with a sequel that does, I would gladly buy it. But it does cover the basics quite well."
2,NO ANSWERS PROVIDED FOR ANY OF THE QUESTIONS IN THE TEXT.,"For those of us who rely on answers to help us tell if we are on the right track or not, this book isn't the right one for me."
1,Absolutely Horrible!!,This book was the absolute worst book I have ever read. The author is so negative about life & especially his family. To see life from his point of view was very disturbing. I also found it very alarming that he referred to his own uncle and aunt as Adolf & Eva. What a sad existence Mr. Small must have to feel such hate for his own family!
4,Memories,"Having gone to a small midwestern college during the same period I found this book all too familar. For me, the 70's were an interesting time of both exploration and rebellion. I thought this novel explored both the pain and the joy of the times bringing back memories and feelings I had not visited in many years. I would reccommend this book to anyone but the most right wing. I loved it."
4,Great item - but BAD company,"I purchased several packages at a local retail store to try out and see if they would be good for a butterfly festival.We liked them and I decided to order more directly from Roylco. Their site stated that there were 80 to a pkg. I ordered 6 (additional) packages.I arrived only 48 to a package. I emailed as soon as I received them in order for them to right it in time for the festival.I had to follow up with a call and had to leave a message. Someone FINALLY called me back and said she would check into my (original) email and get back with me the next day.NEVER heard back from them!The company is HORRIBLE!Overall, the kids that did get to do these, really enjoyed them. Too bad we didn't have enough b/c of the company not being reputable. I even had a teacher ask where she could get some for her class, too bad I couldn't in good conscience direct her to Roylco."
5,An enthraling personal journey of body and mind.,"Andrew Stevenson takes you through the mountains of the Himalayas and the Annapurna Circuit and on a journey of spiritual fulfilment. He realises physical targets, fulfills a spiritual quest and I believe finds a solution to his personal trauma.The description had me traveling up there with him, my foot falls behind his and my soul tagging on not far behind.I look forward to his next journey."
3,Lovely Textbook,"This book is a genuinely informative and at times engrossing view into the making and understanding of pictures. However, it reads (not surprisingly) like a textbook; it is brilliant and thought-provoking in some parts but dryly monotonous in others. (The bridge-building bit stands out as particularly tedious.) The points Baxandall makes via this tediousness are no less brilliant, but their lustre is lost beneath layers of dull, yawn-worthy prose. Baxandall's stylistic shortcomings should not scare away anyone with a passionate interest in the study of Art and its interpretation. But for the layman in search of a clear and down-to-earth discussion of how to look at pictures, this is probably a book to avoid."
4,Dreamweaver 4.0 Review,The Dreamweaver 4.0 program was selected by me for two reason: 1. Because I am a beginner at web creation. 2. My present computer is not the most current as to ability. The program will help me greatly to design a website with basic usage. I am very thankful for this version still being available.
5,This is the absolute best,"I've been developing web sites since 1995 and I have tried absolutely everything for web development. I keep coming back to this as the solution. I tried Microsoft Front Page, but that took so long to learn to get past the basics, and I had so many problems with uploading sites and especially individual pages that I concluded it is just not a professional tool.The system for creating templates can speed the creation and update of your web creation tremendously. I have done over 400 small business websites with this product and think you should start with this one, and learn how to use it really well. It is the best. I now have other designers working with me and we can all use this tool and co-operatively design websites and control content. Great integration with other products and technologies too."
2,Nothing Too New Here,"While there have been a few minor upgrades in this version, it is nothing to get excited about. The tools are powerful but the interface is still cryptic and difficult to understand. There are just to many open window, that could easily be consolidated. Adobe's Golive, has all the same functionallity and is more intuitive and user friendly. It works better with photoshop too."
2,Not what I expected.,"I saw the cover photo for this one... four guys with HUGE drums... and thought, yep! I want that!BUT what did I get? Bamboo flute music. The drums are just backing for a flute.What a let down.I was expecting driving, thunderous drums that would shake the foundation of my house... not on this album. The rhythms, while slightly syncopated and infrequently complex, never sit center stage, and never move.And THREE versions of the SAME song? On a CD with 15 tracks, I might tolerate it, but on one with 9 tracks... It's just filler.The only track that stands out is the last one: Dzauku, which was written by Kodo.If you want Japanese drum music that could be used as background music, get this CD.If you want Japanese drum music that shakes the pillars of Heaven, get the ""Best of Kodo"", or even Kitaro's ""Best of Ten Years."""
4,Great Japanese Festival Music,"Nihon Daiko's music features daiko drums, but it also incorporates other instrumentation including the flute and the shamisen. The first track, the folk song Akita Ondo, is the most produced and even features voice. The drumming remains dominant on the entire album, but the other instruments lend a sense of melody to some of the songs. This is Japanese festival music of the highest order. It's not as burly and forceful as Kodo, so if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off buying a Kodo album. Not all daiko groups are the same, thank goodness. I really like Nihon Daiko and hope they release more albums in the US."
3,Maybe 3.5,A pretty good alt-rock cd. The music is generally amazing but sometimes the vocals just aren't all they could be. Takes a week or two to get used to this but after that you probably won't mind a listen or two every now and then. For the fans of the softer side of rock.
4,"surely, this is a band worth watching out for....!","a great album, Trip to the 13th really makes it's mark with tracks like Defense, Live, Paramount and Ain't This the Feeling... If you liked albums made by bands like Lifehouse and Familiar 48, then you'll also be taken with this one. it's not perfect, but all in all, this is a guaranteed ""take your breath away"" album from my point of view!"
4,A Cult by any other name...,"Opus Dei is a destructive insidious opportunistic cult which needs to be exposed for the incredible damage it does. This book is helpful towards that end. Unlike the previous reviewer who has ""heard"" ""visited"" or ""seen""... I have lived Opus Dei. As a former member, I can say with authority that Opus Dei is a malignant cancer on Catholicism. I am pleased that the truth is coming out, as evidenced by this book and others."
1,"I have found Opus Dei to be otherwise, from experience.","As with any prominent institution, it is to be expected that there will error mixed with truth. And the same it is with Opus Dei, an institution of the Catholic Church with members around the world living out the fullness of their Christian life and helping other do so as well. I was disappointed with the injustice this book gives to the public by giving biased views of this loved institution. I have known many members of Opus Dei, have been to centers of Opus Dei and visited the main center in Rome. I have not found anything or anyone there who was not happy, dedicated, sincere and open to me and my friends. This book greatly puts a negative light on everything which is, in fact, noble and good."
4,Comparative Political Science For What It Is Worth.,"I did not read this book because I thought it would be fun, but rather was forced to read this book because it was supposed to be an exemplar of comparative politics. The idea is that comparative political science is not as rigorous as other portions of the discipline, and that this book disproves that fact. Well, I do not agree because Moore's evidence is skewed, even though the comparative method that is used is useful in illustrating differences between units of analysis. The method is nice in that Moore finds differences between different countries and then illustrated how these differences matter or where brought about. Like I said before, I disagree with some of the evidence used, but not the method. It is a dense book, but not all that bad for what it is."
5,A Must Watch Documentary for True Fans of Coco!,"This documentary follows Joey Diaz on a journey through his past and upbringing in North Bergen NJ. If you're a fan of Joey's or of his podcast Beauty and Da Beast, this is a MUST WATCH!!"
5,Check yourself!,"A fantastic look into the life of the amazing Joey Diaz!! Very intriguing to learn about the upbringing of the man, myth and legend!! A million thanks to Joe Rogan for introducing him to the world!!"
1,Less than a month has pulled apart,I order this product and within a month the material has pulled away from the nubs that connect the umbrella spindales. I am trying to find on the websit how to receive a replacement item?
1,Worst Golf Umbrella I've ever owned.,"Do Not Buy This For Golf!Product description represents it as 58"" when fully opened. It's only 49"" in diameter at the widest point. The radius is 29"" so technically one could say there is 58"" of material. Its more like they measured circumference of a partial sphere. It's too small for golf. Also it's too short. When mounted in the umbrella holder of a 3-wheeled golf cart (ClikGear) I have to duck to get under it. (I'm 5' 11"")"
3,Initial Product Evaluation.,"Product was defective. Amazon replaced without question. Have not got a chance to use product because it would not stay open. Also, the height of the umbrella would be better if longer. I'm 5'11"" and can barley fit under it. May be a problem for taller golfers. Can't wait to give it a real trial. Stay tuned."
3,Short Shaft & Not So Big Coverage,"I use this umbrella on my golf push cart to get out of the intense Texas sun. The shaft is short, so my head is always bumping into it, and I'm only 5'9"". Taller golfers should buy another umbrella, for sure. I did notice that this umbrella's sun/heat resistant design works quite well. It's noticeably cooler than a regular golf umbrella.Pros:-Definitely cooler compared to a regular golf umbrella-Excellent wind resistance-Sturdy designCons:-So-so coverage-Short shaftFor some, this umbrella will be a perfect fit, especially if you don't want a full-sized golf umbrella. If you're a golfer wanting to attach an umbrella on your push cart, I highly suggest a bigger sun/heat umbrella. I'm going to buy another one, myself, and give this one to my wife."
2,"Good product, bad shipping","I ordered 5 of these (at the same time) early Monday needing them for a tournament prize this morning (Thursday). I paid for 2- day shipping, but only three arrived on Wednesday. The box was large enough for 10 umbrellas, so I don't understand. Amazon limited these to 5, and I needed 20, so I ordered the other 15 from Innovagolf.com, which all came Wednesday (for no extra charge, by the way). So if you want these on schedule, don't order from Amazon! Who knows when, or if I will get the other two, but for now I have the embarrassment of telling two people they don't get their tee prize!"
5,Excellent quality product,"I was pleasantly surprised when I received this item. I was looking for a replacement umbrella for one which got mashed from heavy winds.The GustBuster is excellent quality, easy to put up and take down. Nice light frame and matching sleeve. I have only had one chance to use it so far in the rain - and guess what? it works!Being in Florida, the added advantage was the sunblock feature. Definately something which I need."
4,Cooler in the sun,"GustBuster SunBlok 58"" Umbrella (Silver)Attached this to my Sun Mountain golf cart and enjoyed a cooler & more comfortable round of golf. Definitely felt like the temp was lower under the umbrella. It may look a little funny but it does the job."
5,Great for sun or rain including in the wind.,I have used this umbrella while golfing in 100+ degrees and it makes a big difference in the tempeture. It is also good in the rain and wind. I would recommend it for any type of use.
3,"GustBuster SunBlok 58"" Umbrella","I was disappointed in the size of the umbrella. I don't know how they measure this umbrella but it seems smaller then 58"". Other then the disappointment in the size it's a very sturdy umbrella."
1,"Cheap, simple parts defective","Upper catch (holds canopy open) broken in two different umbrellas. Way too expensive for the quality of merchandise. The canopy is rather deeply domed, so not as much (sun) coverage as one might expect from a 58"" umbrella."
5,Great,Excellent story teller. Especially good for those fishing western waters or are preparing to do so. The added humor is refreshing.
2,Only for color-coordinated gardeners,"This book uses a rather peculiar method of dividing flowers into sections by color. It has sections for Orange-Red flowers, Pink flowers, Purple-Blue flowers, White flowers, and Yellow flowers, with each section sub-divided into Annuals, Bulbs, Climbers, Perennials, Shrubs, and Trees. Each flower has a photo and about a paragraph of description, with hardly more information than you would find on the average seed packet. This might be a good resource for the professional landscaper or garden designer, but it's a little confusing for this casual backyard gardener."
4,Wonderful Book,"Beautifully illustrated, an exceptional book for every gardener. Lots of species covered. It would be an ideal book for an avid gardener or just a great gift for the ordinary gardener"
3,Not a bad story...,"This story is a tale of deception, kidnapping, and love. Devlin Hawke is a charming character, and I would be interested in reading more of this family. The story is good, with complex twists and turns that are not overwhelming. However, there are many turns of the story that are too outstanding, and just not believable. I enjoyed this story, but found much of it far-fetched. Nevertheless, the characters are genuinely interesting and charming... as is the basis of the story."
4,Good general review of siding installation principles with excellent details of special projects,"Good review of general principles for installation of many different exterior siding materials, with associated trim moldings to add the professional touch to your project. Very fine examples of specialty work by excellent craftman provides good examples of specific regional methods and styles. Although the publishers promote the theme of ""By Pros For Pros"" as an amateur who came to the book looking for some specific guidance and clues on better ways to build a mousetrap (so-to-speak) I was not disapointed. Some projects are a bit esoteric and are fine examples of very specific exterior craftsmanship better left as a magaizine article with a reference in a periodic index instead of a chapter in a survey book on exterior finish work.Still, for my money and time, this publisher and series gets my attention first time everytime."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I bought this to pick up the dog hair that accumulates between my weekly vacuuming with a good vacuum. This picks up SOME of the dog hair & then deposits it in a clump elsewhere. I have a Shark handheld that I've had for several years that is WONDERFUL, but I wanted something I didn't need to plug in. This was a waste of money."
1,Not worth your money!!!,I have had many of the shark cordless sweepers. I run a daycare and use them often. This is the worst one I have ever had!!! It doesn't pick up well at all. The battery dies quickly!! The no touch empty bottom is worthless. Hair and fuzz get stuck in it and when you use it for awhile the trap door becomes weak at closing and dirt gets in the bottom of the machine. I have had it for about 6 months and this week it died. It sounds like the motor froze up so the brushes won't turn even though it has been cleaned out. I would not recommend this model for anyone. The best model they ever had was the professional the battery lasted 90 min. and being used several times a day they lasted about a year & half. Wish they would them back!!!!
1,Useless for almost everything. Do not buy.,"My husband purchased this for me when I asked for a lightweight stick vacuum to manage the dog hair and dirt tracked in on our linoleum floors. The size, light weight, maneuverability, and relative quiet of the product seemed promising, but when used (after a full charge) it failed to pick up half of the dirt and dog hair on the bare floor. Running it over the same spot ten times produced no better results, and actually seemed to make the mess worse by clumping the dog hair. It has a brush but no suction to speak of whatsoever. It wouldn't be worth the money if they cut the price in half. I plan to return it as soon as possible in exchange for another brand."
1,My broom works better...,"I wanted something that didn't require me to bend over and sweep sweep sweep every single day because of dog hair. I figured this electronic sweeper would be the answer to my prayers. WRONG! While it picks up about 60% of the dirt it runs over, it just pushes the rest around and leaves little piles all over the floor. Even after going over the piles it just relocates them. Plain and simple: I do not recommend this to anyone!"
1,Broke the first day...,"I just wanted something for quick pick-ups on rugs and bare floors. This product really disappointed me. Aside from the fact that one of the plastic parts broke the first day (rendering it completely useless since it's a part that needs to be sealed in order to keep suction), there is little to no suction to begin with so basically all this thing did was push the hair and fur around into little stripes.The dust cup is poorly designed - every time I emptied it, I had to reach down and push the flap closed to get it to fit back in. Plus, I couldn't figure out why they designed it so the cup would empty into the base of the thing whenever I used the release button.The only positive worth mentioning is that the brush did seem to rotate strongly enough to pull pet hair out of throw rugs."
1,"2 time owner, not worth the money","I loved this vacuum so much when I first got it that 2 of my best friends also went out and bought one. It picks up alot of dirt and hair on carpet and wonderful on hard floors. But it has not even been 2 years. I am on my second one, and my best friend is also on her second one, and the church nursery's broke also within 6 mons. The problem? The stupid handle breaks off if you so much as very lightly turn it wrong. You hardly have to touch it for the long black handle to break off at the bottom, real helpful! Then you have a working vacuum with no handle, what a joke! So this is 5 vacuums within the course of 2 years that have bit the dust, all the same way, the handle broke on every one. Not worth the money!I'm gonna try another brand next time."
1,Waste of money,"I bought this sweeper to use on my hardwood and tile floors to pick up dog hair. You would think that would be the perfect use for this product, but it does not work at all. I realize it doesn't have any suction because it's not a vacuum cleaner, but the brushes roll a million miles an hour and don't pick up anything. It litteraly pushes the hair around the floor until it clumps up. Might as well buy a broom for 5 bucks."
1,Great for a while,"For the first few months I loved it,I used it all the time. Now I can't even use it. I am unable to recharge it and it is broken even If I were able to use it, I will not suck up. Save yourself 65.00 and do not buy this product."
2,Not nearly worth the hype,"I've owned the Shark Sweeper for about a year now, and it stopped working after about 9 months. I was very careful with the care of it - not leaving it plugged in for extended periods of time, etc. I clean out the brush/roller and canister regularly, but it just won't suck anything up anymore. When it does run, it only runs for about 5-10 minutes and barely does anything. Now when it was brand new out of the box, it was wonderful - very thorough. But if I spend more than 20 bucks on something, I would like it to last at least a year, I don't think that's too much to ask! Don't waste your money - or if you do, get a much cheaper model so you're not angry when you have to throw it out!"
1,Don't get this sweeper,"This is the worst sweeper vacuum ever. Do not get this sweeper. Horrible... I have wood laminate floors. You have to run the sweeper vacuum over the floor a million times to get dog hair up.. Works okay on area rugs but when you make the transition from area rug to carpet, all the hair is left on the carpet. I honestly think this is the worst product I ever bought...Do not buy this sweeper vacuum...."
2,First year was fine,"The first year I owned this vacuum it worked fine, lightweight and convenient. When it is used on carpet, battery time is quickly diminished. I bought a new battery at some point, but it did not improve usable time. Some other problem must have developed, as I limited its use to the kitchen floor. It picked up okay, but it just would not last. I finally ended up throwing it away regrettably, but the battery just would not last more than 5-7 minutes, and it was brand new. Because of this, I would not buy another Shark product. I'm searching for a new cordless vac."
2,Okay not great,Sometimes I have to pass it twice specially in tiles floors and in the corners. I used everyday but I will like a better one. I guess I can said it is handy but it need to improve specially for a busy mothers like me.
4,Great tips for beginners,"This is a really great reference to have. I'm a newbie seamster and just by using a couple of the tips in this book, I have really improved my sewing skills."
4,Mother Pletsch's Painless Sewing,This book was a actually a short version of the bigger book Fit for Real People even though they are not by the same author. I found it a quick read through the first time and a good reference in the future for specific questions.
1,"Overwritten, mediocre, a real disappointment","I normally love reading this kind of novel, but this is the first time I have been seriously let down by the genre. A flimsy excuse for a plot and two-dimensional characterisation is desperately inflated by the half-witted, overbaked prose. Nothing happens! Barely thick enough to prop up a wonky table leg, it wasn't even useful in this area -- although some may find it effective as a seditive -- or an emetic. Dull."
3,Straps are too short.,The straps are too short for my windsurf board. So I have to use an other strap.
5,Bomber Board Carrier!,"Bought this attachment from another retailer but its the same product. Boards go on and off, super fast and easy. One thing that bears mention is that it doesn't work with two wide (23"") boards stacked on top of each other. Besides that, you'll be stoked with the simplicity and security of this carrier. Alo-o-o-ha!"
1,Old Surf carrier was MUCH better,"The good news. Item fits thule, OEM or any other roof rack according to its box which is nice in case you have another vehicle w/out a thule rack. Keeps board secure in cradle.The bad news: The straps WHISTLE when on the top of the board. And the plastic hooks into the feet don't feel as stable as the rubber straps in the previous model. I'll be sending these back pronto."
4,Satisied with the item.,Satisied with the item and would purchase it againWould recomend it to others it is reliable and value worthy.
4,"Compatible with the Epson R800 and R1800 photo printers, March 26, 2007","When it comes to ink for my R1800 photo printer, I am concerned with the quality of the images I print. The Epson red UltraChrome Hi-Gloss ink cartridge provides superior resistance to water, fading and smudging. It is important to me that my prints are of high quality, so I don't attempt to use the cheaper compatible ink cartridges. The color can be duplicated, but all inks are not created equal. Third party options may produce a good print initially, but may not hold up or last as long.PROS:Provides superior resistance to water, fading and smudgingCONS:Price"
3,"Great Ink, Horrible Costs","Epson makes a fine printer, though probably not the best. I continually get banding and bluish prints out of it my R1800. It also clogs up all the time, so I have to run constant cleaning utilites which uses up all my ink...which leads to this review. There are SEVEN total ink cartridges and each one costs over $13.00. This seems reasonable enough except that I'm always running out and constantly ordering more ink. I print a fair amount of prints and proofs for my clients and but it's ridiculous how little ink there is in each cartridge. I spent $500 for my printer and in the last three years I've spent well over $1000 in ink, plus all the paper I buy to reprint messed-up prints caused by clogging. This printer It's a rip-off and a scam and I intend to toss it out ONLY because of the ink costs."
3,Ink is just expensive,"It's how the printer companies really make their money. I cringe that it costs me $120 to replace all of my ink cartridges on my Epson R1800 and I never get as many prints as I think I should. A necessity for sure, there is no way around buying these things, I just wish they were a little cheaper. The quality of the inks are very good though and the prints I get from the R1800 are outstanding."
2,Epson Ink Hog,The ink cartridge is O.K. but the Epson R1800 printer is a huge ink hog. The Epson printer's that use this cartridge should all be recalled.
5,as expected,What's to say about this. It is a genuine Epson cartridge that saved me a longish trip to computer store. Recommended.
4,Compatible with the Epson R800 and R1800 photo printers,"When it comes to ink for my R1800 photo printer, I am concerned with the quality of the images I print. The Epson cyan UltraChrome Hi-Gloss ink cartridge provides superior resistance to water, fading and smudging.

Third party options may produce a good print initially, but may not hold up or last as long.PROS:Provides superior resistance to water, fading and smudgingCONS:Price"
1,I'm so sick of Epson Cartridges,"I will never buy another Epson product. I must have spent close to a thousand dollars replacing un-empty ink cartridges. I don't print very often but ever time I do I need to replace one of the cartridges and there is nothing quite so irritating as replacing a cartridge that you can tell is nearly full. I think Epson should be sued and forced to reimburse us all for their lieing, thieving printers."
3,Good ink at too high a price,"If you like the quality of prints from your R800 printer, you're pretty much stuck with buying inks from Epson. There are some hacks that will let you use other manufacturers, but if you care about color fidelity, you'll stay with Epson. These inks give a nice painterly look and hold up nicely. But Epson sure makes a nice margin. Grit your teeth and pay."
5,Good Ink ~~~~~,"What can I say - Factory ink is good stuff and when it comes from Amazon it is not only good but it is priced better than anywhere else. Unless I need ink ""right now"" I order from Amazon and save a little over some places and save a LOT over others."
1,mistake,"I was not sent the cartridge in the photo. Not being a very savvy Amazon purchaser yet, I opened the box, saw it did not fit my printer (R 1800)and got upset. I eventually took it to Staples to see if they would trade with me. (They did at one other time, when they had some damaged boxes with ink for an R 1800.) However they couldn't help me this time. The woman took the cartridge to the back, found out it had expired in 2006, and offered me the usual $2 for returning a cartridge to recycle. Turns out it was for an R 800 printer, not R 1800. So I paid for the cartridge and the shipping and got no cartridge, had to make a trip to figure out what to do, and a $2 refund in effect. Bummer."
4,use the real stuff,"photo printers are a bit of a logistic headache, with all the separate ink cartridges. how annoying it is to get some refilled junk from a local computer store that won't let you print. assuming that Amazon never sells refills, i.e., only sells factory new cartridges from the original maker, that is the only way to go.i cannot objectively compare Epson inks to alternative products, but i know they give me excellent results for the most exacting requirements that i have which is reproducing photographs."
1,Epson Ink Cartel: BEWARE!,"I am a professional photographer and five years ago I bought the cheaply-made Epson R1800 printer. Since then I've spent over $1000 on ink and I only print in moderate quantities. This POS printer uses way too much ink which I'm constantly buying to replace the eight ink set at $13.00 eaach! This would be fine and dandy except that the printer nozzles are always clogging and you have to constantly run the ink-sucking maintenance tools to get a decent print. When it does work, the prints have an ugly bluish-cast. BUYERS BEWARE: don't buy Epson ink or printers. Its a scam!"
5,"Excellent, Clear, and (Surprize) Humorous",I got this book for my artist wife who had a question about how to properly space posts in perspective.She enjoyed the book and now has the answer to her question as well as other helpful lessons about drawing and perspective.As a retired mechanical engineer I thought I'd just browse through the book. I read it cover to cover and was motivated to start sketching. It is clearly written and spiced with humor.I now look at things more perceptively thanks to Mr. Metzger.
4,Easy to use,This book is quite useful in its simplicity. I can almost use it as a direct guide while I draw.
4,Perspective,This was a very helpful book and one that my drawing teacher recommended. I learned a lot between the book and the teacher
3,Book was okay,Purchased as a textbook for a student. Book served it's purpose. Not much else to say. Shipped and delivered promptly.
3,basic perspective,"This is a very basic perspective book. It is good for grasping basic understanding but as an instructor of Linear Perspective, it did not go far enough. It was one of many books in my arsenal.,"
2,The title lies,This book is very painful to read. It was assigned to me as a textbook for an art class I took at University and I don't think I would have read it otherwise.
3,works for only devices that don't need more power,"This hub is not powered and does a fine job for mice, flash drives and other underpowered devices. But does not work with scanners, external drive etc. It has an adapter hole for a power adapter, but even Belkin doesn't sell it. I had no luck locating one on the web."
2,Can't Handle Higher Loads,"As commented elsewhere, this is a great product if all you want to do is connect your mouse, or other small devices. However, I constantly get an overload condition with just the mouse and my keyboard. Unfortunately I can't recommend this product."
1,Waste of Money,"This product started off great and then in a matter of no time one by one the usb slots died. Why I ask myself, there is no power supply. It plugs into the computer. All it is, is a slot. Within 3 months it completely became useless. No matter what you plugged into it. And here is the kicker, I did not apply a heavy use with it only my keyboard.Save your money, and research a better product. I am totally disappointed."
3,Wish I knew what I really needed,This Hi Speed Port Hub is nice and does work well (Once I got what I really needed). For some reason I thought this 2.0 Hi Speed USB port was what was needed to speed up my internet speed for my wireless adapter. I actually needed the internal usb card for my computer to make that happen. So after I got that and installed it everything worked just fine and this Belkin Hi speed 4 port mini hub is a nice addition giving me extra ports to use with my newly found faster transfer speed.
5,Works great.,"This does as advertised. I like it better than it's previous model, but the corny little door distorts a little if the USB dongle cord is slightly offset during closing."
4,Fit fine,We have to buy our stuff online as there is no shopping near us. We ordered the size we normally buy and they fit. Lee is a good brand and we are sure they will hold up as well.
5,Landmark study of Indo-Tibetan philosophy,"Ruegg's work is a great synthesis of information derived from primary and secondary sources, and explores the ways in which important themes of Indian Buddhist thought (buddha-nature, conceptions of mind and enlightenment) were interpreted and adapted in the complex cultural matrix of early Buddhist Tibet. A must-read for anyone wanting a deeper take on the cultural history of Tibetan Buddhism, or the history of Tibetan Buddhist philosophical interpretations!"
4,"Jeez, it's a picture book!","I rather liked this book. Yes it's gushy and fluffy. I particularly liked the part about Walter Annenberg's interest in ecology after he turned 250 acres of desert into a personal Euro-Disney. However the pictures are nice, if somewhat disembodied from their context. The text is ridiculous, but I'm trying to get worked up to buy property there, so I was mainly interested in images. Of course, there is nothing useful in the way of floor plans, site maps, etc. However, if you live in the Midwest or New England and want to get really depressed about your current weather, this is the book to buy."
5,Great read for edgy MCM enthuisiasts,"What I love about Palm Springs Modern is the variety of architects and styles featured. There are great photographs, including houses by John Lautner, Richard Neutra, Craig Ellwood, and Albert Frey among others. A particularly pleasant surprise is the section on the Maslon house by Neutra which was foolishly demolished a few years ago. Love this book!"
3,Less is NOT more,"This book does serve a purpose, in that it gives a peek into a handful of distinguished Palm Springs residences. Sure, we get to see a few pictures of the famous Kaufmann house (by Neutra), and a few other houses that pretty much look like it, photographed in chilly and clinical detail, accompanied by a chilly monograph. But we have no sense of how these houses may have inspired more ordinary buildings in town, like the wonderful Alexander subdivisions -- which I'm told comprise the most consistent collection of modern suburban architecture in the USA. Where are the houses that regular folks live in? A few crumbs could have been thrown to the masses ... I would have liked some gas stations, some cool furniture, a dash of innovative interior design, perhaps. Go ahead and buy it, but I can pretty much guarantee that as a coffee table book, it's fairly unappetizing fare. And it doesn't much relate to the familiar Palm Springs modern style we all know and love."
5,KGV Tamiya 1/700,This was a great model to build. I was very impressed with the history that was included in the manual. Also the detail that was put in the production of this model was amazing. I can't wait to get more these models.
3,COULD BE BETTER,JUST NEEDS TO BE ALOT HARDER BANDS. IT'S NOT BAD IF YOUR INTO THOSE BANDS. IT SHOWED ME A VERY LIGHT SIDE OF DEATH METAL IF THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL IT.
1,Even Death can't save this DVD,"Death is just the beginning Vol. 7 , A title wich in itself brings hopes of ogre metal cave troll bashing riffs, but do you get it? No, ""Death is just the beginning Vol. 7"" Wich has cover art of skeletons and graves brings hope of gore metal hatchet to the head mentality but do you get it? No, what you get is extreme power metal with big fluffy hair, dragon-heart themed rock ballads wich where supposed to be dead and gone with the fall of the year 1989 and the rise of the 1990's. This DVD is a waste of time, well unless you like 40 year old men dancing around in leather and studs singing about taking over the whole world with their heavy metal, or unless you work in a steel mill.With very few exceptions the bands on this DVD have as much talent as finger nail clippings so do their fans. Thanks Nuclear Blast for making me smash my TV!DaveCore"
1,Cassette vs. CD at Amazon,Be careful when you order. I had seen this as a CD and thought it would be great for the car. I bought from an Amazon seller for only a few $$ but did not notice it was a cassette tape. Sending it back would cost more than I paid. I have yet to round up a cassette player to listen to it. Just check the format before you order
2,"Can you ""BEAR"" to see this movie?","as usual MST3K fodder goes, there are more memorable movies. This one has a plot, which is unusual for MST3K fare. It is a rather stupid plot however. The main antagonist looks a lot less like a hunter than a clerk at Radio Shack. Robert Reed ""outs"" himself in this movie long before his ""Brady"" days by wearing such a tight shirt that his liver can be seen.The main star of this movie is that stuffed bear! The bots heap plenty of ridicule at it. That smile on the bear's face tells volumes of riffing material to our bots!Although there are better MST3K episodes out there, the true die-hard MSTie will enjoy this one!"
3,Its a phone!,Just a regular phone - lasted a long time. Not for sure if they even sell this model any longer.
1,dont buy GE phones!!!!!,"I had bought a similiar phone from GE and I am very angry. It was a phone system that had 1 base and 3 extra handsets. Well after a lot of problems and then the handsets not being able to register with the base, I sent them back to GE for an ""exchange"". After waiting for a couple of months they said that they no longer were able to exchange my phone (they didnt have anymore of this item) and had NO upgrades that they could give me so they are sending me my money back. HELLO, this doesnt help me. Now I dont have my phones and I cant find phones that have 1 base and 3 headsets for the original price that I paid.well I guess its ""thanks GE for letting me use your phone system"""
3,OK for all purposes except boiling,"Although Rival claims this product can be boiled, we have had the bags break open on the bottom (area that was factory sealed) while boiling, leaving us with soup instead of a nice meal. It may be fine for vacuum sealing and storing but I can't trust the bags to be boiled."
3,"Farewell, Giorgio!",Yes Giorgio was the only cinematographic incursion of Luciano Pavarotti in the great screen as an opera singer who recovers his vanished voice thanks to the miracle of love.A simple and amusing film without major complications.
4,"Yes, Giorgio","This movie is an ego trip for Luciano Pavarotti. The music in it is magnificent, and we all love Luciano. However, he should know better than trying to be irresistable. I bought the movie to hear the music. I recommend other viewers do the same."
4,Great voice!,"The great Pavorotti is now, gone and with him, went a truly marvelous voice! The movie is a bit contrived; but, worth watching, since the viewer can hear the fabulous tenor!"
5,Great Movie,"A movie which we had seen a long time ago, but enjoyed so much. Glad to have my own copy now."
2,"diksappointed in ""Yes, Giorgio""","I think I would have liked it, but the sound quality was so poor, it was unlistenable. I bought it only because of Pavarotti, not because I thought the movie would be any good, which it wasn't, and then I could hardly hear his voice. The visual was very good, beautiful scenery and all that, but I was extremely disappointed."
3,Most enjoyable!!,"I've been looking for this video for years ~ why isn't it being released? The scenery, music & hot air balloon ride over the Napa Valley ~ absolute romance!! Call me an incurable romantic, but couldn't we all use more examples of this kind of beautiful romance? Loved 'Joan from CAlifornia's' comment to look beyond the girth to search for the mirth! Does anyone out there have a copy of this movie?"
1,Are you Kidding?,"Really? One question to all the reviewers of this movie? Have you seen a different movie that I did? I mean, don't get me wrong. I LOVE Pavarotti - the greatest voice of the 20th century for my money - but SERIOUSLY. This movie? It completely lived down to my expectations. I saw Pavarotti onstage many times and understood that he could not act - and didn't care! But in a huge house, his voice and presence and the whole ambiance of Opera made it unimportant. But on film - he has nowhere to hide - and all his acting flaws are exposed.Now, having said that - I REALLY want this movie on DVD - because along with my full MST3K collection, there is nothing I'd enjoy more than a nice evening with some pasta, a bottle of wine and GIORGIO!Enjoy it for the right reasons, people - but don't make it into something it's not."
1,"Pavarotti can't act in a movie, either!","Fortunately for us all, in this ""romantic"" comedy (the story of a philandering opera star and the doctor who inexplicably is willing to dally with him), Pavarotti undresses no further than a massive shirt and shorts. Sole redeeming factors: scenery (Italy, Napa Valley, San Francisco) and singing."
3,nice tribue album,"There's some pretty good covers here. The main highlights are Mott the Hoople's version of ""All the Young Dudes"" and Iggy Pop's ""China Girl"". This also has the energetic Bauhaus's version of ""Ziggy Stardust"". My favorite song on here is one that was never released by Bowie. It's ""Silver Treetop School for Boys"" by the Beatstalkers. The song is very short, but it's an absolute classic and the one song alone is worth the money. This is an import, and if you can find it I would recommend it to any Bowie fan."
1,"Love Hint Water, but NOT this flavor","I adore Hint water products. Honeydew hybiscus is by far the best, I also really enjoy the cucumber and watermelon. This flavor is absolutely horrid. Out of all the flavors I tried, this one is disgusting. Do yourself and try another flavor or get a multipack to try out what you like."
4,My Favorite Flavor So Far,"I really like this flavor. It's delicate and refreshing, but actually tastes like raspberry and lime. All the Hint products I have tried have been good quality, but are expensive for what they are, which is water with a little bit of fruit extract.Recently, however, I have switched to making my own fruit essence waters. It's SO much cheaper and doesn't have the guilt that comes with plastic bottle usage.If you're looking for a less costly, more environmentally friendly alternative, check out Bakto Extracts (or a similar product). They have a wide variety of flavors that I've enjoyed experimenting with."
4,BUY IT,Raspberry-Lime is delicious but not my favorite HINT flavor. This water is a great idea. I take it with me when I go out. To me it is more refreshing than just plain water and I still feel healthy drinking it.
2,Another Low in a False Advertising,"The table tennis balls are officially rated between 1 and 3 stars, 3 stars being the best and of a competition quality.Four star ping-pong ball is a marketing trick.What is next?? A $20 6 - star ball??"
4,Quite a good compilation for the money.,"OK, not every track on this compilation is mind blowing, but for the money there are a few on this, and it's quite a good selection from assorted thrash/death metal bands. Most of the riffs are dam heavy, and the music is fast. For somebody who just wants to have a listen to a selection of metal bands they had never heard before this is not a bad buy."
1,Thoroughly Disappointing,"The number of books out there dedicated to using Flash as an animation medium can be counted on one hand, and most of those aren't very good. Despite the title, this book doesn't really qualify as an animation book.Much of the book covers non-animation topics like typography and video while animation topics like anticipation get less page space than the history of True Type fonts or noting when Nintendo added the Power Pad to its NES bundle.Even the off-topic of creating Flash content for mobile phones, which seems to be author's area of expertise, doesn't get covered very well.There's also an abundance of typos, clunky wordings and out of date text apparently copied from previous versions.All in all, I'm very angry I spent $30 for such a poor book."
2,Half the instructions is missing,"If the instruction in chapter one-the tutorial for the walk cycle is what the rest of the the book is like, then I have wasted my money!If I didn't know Flash and had not already completed several walk cycles, I would not have a clue on what the author is trying to describe. He makes reference to objects that don't exist. Part of the writing seems like it was written for something else. The instruction on creating symbols and building elements within the symbol is ridiculous. If I had not already understood how to build nested symbols, I certainly would not have learned from this book.The book does haves some nice examples and references to professional flash work, but that's about it. It has given me a serious headacheI am hoping the remaining chapters are much, much better. I can only hope."
2,Ehh,Cover is nice looking but it interferes with the glide when opening and closing the phone. You have to manually push and close all the way open and shut as opposed to giving it a start and the glide spring taking over and it will probably crack if I drop the phone. I prefer leather or rubberized material for protection. This is more for looks.
3,It was good until it broke,"I bought the T100 right before taking a vacation. I liked almost everything about it (big LCD, small size, intuitive controls, short shutter delay) until 3 days into my vacation when it stopped functioning. I will let you know more when I get it repaired (1 yr warranty)."
2,Blurred Pictures,"I have had this camera for over a year and at first I though it was me taking a blured picture occasionally. It was not, the camera for no apparent reason will blurr 1 out of 10 pictures. If the flash is on the percent is better but I still do not recommend this camera.Charles Krugman"
1,* * * W a r n i n g * * *,"I normally never write reviews but after owning one myself I felt it necessary to help others not end up with the same problems I had.Camera looks great, compact, and takes ok pictures in outdoors with bright lights, but indoors don't even use it. Florescent lighting makes the pictures yellow orange. Face recognition does'nt work all the time. Most indoor pictures are blurry and soft. Red eye does not work all the time. I own a 4 megapixel sony and it takes better pictures than this camera. Flash is dissapointing making pictures dark if not close (5-10ft). This camera should have never even been released to the market. This camera is a waste of your money. Please don't make the same mistake I did! The pictures were so bad in the end that I now use it as a paper weight."
4,very good camera,Good product from sony.I am surprised to see its price getting increased after I had purchased the product.
3,Somewhat disappointed...but overall still happy with camera,"I bought this camera b/c of the strong reviews for it. I am generally not a big Sony fan b/c they are generally priced a little higher and the issues with imbedded software whenever you use their programs. I like the UI-there have been some complaints about the size of buttons being too small, but I have not found that to be an issue. Also, I think that the menu items that you want to get to are easily accessible and easy to use.My complaint is that I really just wanted a point-and-shoot camera right out of the box...and it is, except when it isn't. I set it up for 'auto' adjustment and the first pictures I took were grainy and not evenly lit. I messed around with the settings and found there to be significant differences in the picture quality after doing that, however, that means that to take really good pictures everytime, I have to mess with the settings-I just don't want to think that much about it."
2,Not a great buy!,Not a great buy. Bought this one for my cousin. The picture quality aint all that great for the price you pay for this camera.
1,It's Totally Junk!,"My camera doesn't work properly. When I took my first photo, I felt deep disappointment. The performance is very bad for these features.I've sent it back to SOny, then as far as I can see, my camera is in repair mode for a long time. I am so remorseful that I could not buy any sony products. I hoped that Sony could change my camera, but they didn't . I don't know how long it will take their response. It's needed to think twice before buying this camera."
1,Great,Beautiful camera. Perfect present for mothers day. She loves the red color. User freindly and beautiful pictures
2,Very disappointed,"I have had many Sony digital cameras over the years, and I was very excited to get my hands on this one. Its compact design looks great, its big bright display on the back is excellent, and it even takes great movies.However, this is a *camera* so what ultimately matters are its photos, and here it really disappoints. If all of your photos are outdoors on bright sunny days, then you'll be happy. If you take photos indoors (even on a bright sunny day with lots of ambient sunlight filling the room) or in low light, the images are stunningly awful. Lots of color speckling and distortion, and unusably blurry - even if the camera is completely steady (like on a tripod or setting on a table).The photo quality of my Sony Cybershot DSC-P100 5.1 MPixel from a few years ago is far superior."
4,It's convenient and it works,"It took a bit of getting used to, but the bottom line is that this camera works well in the trenches. Sure, I might have some little nits, but I wanted a camera that 1) I could carry around in a pocket without a bulky case, 2) was not cumbersome to handle, pack, carry, or use, 3) could take good pictures quickly and reliably, 4) could switch picture-taking modes on the fly, 5) could last all day without changing batteries or memory sticks. So I bought this camera, took it to Europe for a week, used it all day, every day, even took video, stuck it in my pants pocket when I wasn't using it. I re-charged the battery each night (although I probably didn't always have to) and ended up using only 2/3 of a 4GB memory stick. Got great pics, indoor and out -- and a bonus: the red color makes it harder to misplace than if it was black or silver. Yes, it's expensive, but it works, it's as convenient as I had hoped, and I'm happy with it."
1,"Attractive looking, fantastic screen---horrible pictures","At first glance this camera seems like a good buy---it looks great, feels comfortable in your hands, and even has a nice user-interface. We tested it out at a local retail store and it even seemed to take great pictures (or at least they looked good---on the display screen).Downloading the photos onto your computer revealed the true nature of the T100, however: every photograph was awful. The ""8.1 megapixels"" is a joke because your pictures come out looking like an impressionistic painting. Colors bleed, images are grainy (not sharp), and this is totally unacceptable for a $400 camera. Even adjusting ISO settings and manually configuring picture-capture modes can't reduce the issues we had. Do not buy this if you're looking for something that takes decent pictures."
3,Hmm - Just ok,"I had my T100 for 1 day and returned it. In comparing the photos from it my other digitial cameras I noticed a few things. 1. The outdoor shots were really nice. 2. The indoor shots were just ok. Close up items were in focus and clear but the further you got away and into the darker areas of the room, the more pixelated it became. Also, shots of our caleco cats looked flat. It was like the camera got confused and tried to paint colors on the cats and it wasn't natural. Just for reference, I did not change any settings on the camera from when it came out of the box. The resolution was at 8 megapixels and all other settings were factory. All I did was put in the card and battery."
5,Great Quality,"This little camera gives me awesome picture quality and is easy to use. I have not purchased the flash unit yet, but so far I have not needed it."
2,Very Grainy Pictures,I am disappointed with this camera. The images it turns out especially in low light are extremely grainy. I have tried all auto and manual settings. The specs look good on paper but the quality aspect is missing. I returned it with no hesitation.
1,Big Price Tag for Poor Performance,"At this price level this camera should be a performer. It looks great, is well built and easy to use yet I could not get one great picture out this camera no matter how hard I tried. If you are contemplating this unit think again and buy a Canon."
5,The Best Camera I have ever used!!!!!!,"It's simply the Best Camera I have ever used. I have been a big Canon fan for years but they just don't have a camera this size, price, and with 5x optical zoom so I tried this Sony. No more 3x or 4x zoom for me 5x optical zoom with steady shot does a great job is the only way to go. This camera has a great picture quality too."
5,CANON PEOPLE COME ON,"WHY DO YOU CANON PEOPLE BOTHER TO LOOK AT SONY? YOU TWEEK CANONS BUT EXPECT SONY TO BE PERFECT ON AUTO MODE! WHY? I HAVE BOTH CANON AND SONY THEY BOTH WORK ABOUT THE SAME, NEITHER WORK WELL IN LOW LIGHT AND YOU ALL NO THAT. THE SONY CAN BE SET IN MORE THAT ONE MODE TO GIVE VERY GOOD (SAMLL) CAMERA PICTURES, WHAT DO PEOPLE EXPECT FROM A SAMLL LENS CAMERA? GET A CANON 30D AND PACK THAT AROUND. I THINK THE PICTURES ARE VERY GOOD, NOT GREAT BUT FOR $349.00 NOT BAD!! USE HIGH FLASH AND 800 OR MORE ISO FOR VERY DARK SETTINGS, FOR BETTER QUALITY HOLD THE CAMERA STILL OR USE A TRIPOD (AS WITH ANY CAMERA) FOR BETTER QUALITY!!!"
4,It is what it is,"I was looking for a camera that would fit in my pocket so I'd use it more, that took great pictures, had more than 3x zoom, had a large display, and that started up incredibly fast and focused quickly. On that list of requirements, the DSC-T100 scores 5 stars. If this is what you're looking for, get the camera.Downsides are as mentioned elsewhere: changing modes is a pain; there are two menus and I never remember which one to use; and I hit the flash mode button by accident fairly frequently."
2,Acceptable at best.,"If you're not picky about your images and just want a light-weight, stylish camera, the DSC-T100 is fine. I just upgraded to it from a DSC-W1, which I'd had for years. I was really happy with my old one and thought the update sounded wonderful, but I think my old camera took better shots. With the DSC-T100, I get a lot of noise in every picture, I get chromatic aberrations around even mild highlights and the pictures also have a lot of ""lens bend"" to them. In a word, my pictures look cheap. When I looked at people using the same camera on flickr, I saw a lot of the same issues in their shots. If everything I just wrote sounds like gibberish, you'll probably do fine with this camera, but I'm disappointed that Sony put out such a bad camera."
2,Disappointed,"This is the third digital camera I've owned and the picture quality is terrible. The pictures come out blotchy and blurry unless the object is standing perfectly still and there's the perfect amount of light. I love the camera, it's display and menu, and the overall handiness, but the pictures are truly disappointing."
2,What's with the price hike?,"Everyone, including Cnet, is talking about what a great deal this camera is for $400. But I can't find it anywhere for less than $600. Did the price go up recently?"
4,love the camera,"I love the camera, I was scared at first because of the bad reports some people said but others loved it... I am very glad I bought it"
5,A wonderful little camera,I've taken thousands of pictures so far and for the size of the lens I'm very pleased with this camera and it's features. I'm never without it in my pocket. The battery life is great. The 5X zoom is handy.
2,Not good enough.......,"I bought this camera as an upgrade to my Sony DSC-T30, but much to my dismay, it really isn't any better. Sure the T100 has 5X zoom, has face detection (which is more of a gimmick BTW---and doesn't work half the time), and has 1 more megapixel than my T30---which really doesn't matter much. The BIG problem with these cameras are the critical indoor shots....it's still terrible...I see no improvement in the T100 over my T30....the shots are still very grainy, underexposed, occasionally out of focus, and red-eyes galore. The menu system in the T100 is also needlessly complicated compared to the T30....too many button presses to get to the right setting. All-in-all, too much $$$ for a camera that underperforms when things get a little tough. This thing is going back. The search for the perfect point-and-shoot continues....."
2,"Worked great for 8 months, then stopped working","I watched the reviews for this camera, and picked it up since it was so well reviewed. While it was working, it was a great point-and-click camera that we used regularly for travel and real estate work.However, just recently, about 8 months after we bought it, the camera just stopped working. After sending it in to Sony, they claimed it was corrosion damage and not covered by warranty.Given that we are very careful with our cameras and keep them in cases unless they are being used, I was very disappointed with Sony's product and handling of the issue. If the camera is corroded within 8 months of normal use, then it seems it's a product issue."
