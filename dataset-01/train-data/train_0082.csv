3,User-friendly format; delay in issue receipt,"I have been purchasing this paper about once a week for the past four weeks. Since I don't read it every day, the price ($0.75) is perfect on a per-issue basis. The format is easy to flip through and it is just as good as reading a paper on-line. The reason I only give 3 stars is because of the delay. For whatever reason, when I've clicked on ""purchase current issue,"" I've often received the prior day's paper. Since Germany is ahead of us timewise, I find this a little odd. It is also a bit irritating not to be able to buy as ""current issue"" the paper that's being sold on newsstands."
2,"Not in the same league as O'brien, Kent, Lambdin or Pope.","A very thinly fleshed out novel, with a bare minimum of the details needed to make it a novel worth reading. Mack's attempt to cover a period of Kilburnie career from before the mast to Post Captain didn't allow room to develope the book properly, making the book read more as a synopsis or outline instead of a stand a lone novel. Mack needs to do much more research about the Royal Navy of that period. His ending was a prime example of the lack of a serious attempt to write a seafaring novel worthy of O'brien and his peers. Capt. Kilburnie has his command sunk and he merrily goes to Scotland with no effort to get to the Admiralty or stand trial for the lost of his ship, which was standing proceedure for the time if all the other top authors of the gernre are to be believed. I suggest that Adm. Mack stick to novels of the 20th century Navy, with which he is more aquainted, also a new publicist couldn't hurt."
1,Is this book a cleverly disguised spoof?,"I have a collection of hundreds of tall ship volumes, and have read all the greats, but this one stands alone. It reeks like rotten seaweed! This author demonstrates for us a virtually encyclopedic lack of knowledge of the tall ships era. He also treats us to an overlayment of the modern American navy ethos and personnel relationships onto the tall ships British navy. This lends the same verisimilitude as would cast-iron sails. The critic who called this utter dreck was too kind by half, and I felt constrained by a system that apparently has no rating below one star."
1,Definitely Not Patrick O'Brien,"After reading Patrick O'Brien, Richard Woodman, and the Bothlio series, don't think Vice Admiral Mack cuts the mustard. Wondering if author did any research into the period. The relationships between master and servant are totally skewed, the conversations could be taking place during the 20th century, and VERY few women would tottle off to their gynecologist, much less even know one existed. All in all I felt the book totally lacking in character, and not well written - even boring."
4,Intriguing&#65533; a different format... enjoyable,"I enjoyed this novel even though the format is vastly different from O'Brian, Kent, Lambdin, Pope and the other major writers in this genre. Following the career of Fergus Kilburnie from lowly sailor to Post Captain in one book forces a faster pace and fewer details than is normally encountered. While I prefer the normal format of one ship, one major battle or event per book - which allows for better character development, this was a fun read. When I finished, I immediately ordered the sequel."
1,Possibly the worst book I've ever read,"Need I say more? Not worth your money, and I wish I could get mine back. Doesn't even rate 1 star, but the system requires me to enter one."
3,N.O.H.A. - Next Plateau,"Germany continues its takeover of the world, and N.O.H.A.'s NEXT PLATEAU, which takes on the more uptempo side of the future jazz armistace, is a strong footsoldier, if not a major player. ""Things That Are Beautiful Haunt Me"" doesn't quite haunt the way it should, and the gypsy leanings of ""Balkan Hot-Step"" and the quasi-Caribbean ""Chillin'"" feel pandering. ""Peking Express,"" thankfully, doesn't indulge in Orientalist cliche, but instead goes for uptempo funk. As well, the angry woman lyrics of ""Do You Know"" work, despite the second voice, and ""We Glide On"" is appropriately dreamy. A few tracks (""Next Plateau"") are just out-and-out bland, and some seem to go on a little too long with extraneous codas. The album doesn't quite make it to the next plateau."
5,expensive?,why do people keep saying how expensive this is?!? 7 let me repeat 7 discs for under $40. this is CHEAP for how much you get. keep things in perspective people. you'd spend over $100 for all of it individually
5,"Old Lighting Hopkins,s","Nice ...absoultey super nice ..a must have for your blues collection ..I can not see a blues collection without this box set in it..Too much to say here..I,ll keep it simpleBottom lineYes I would buy this again..For my friendsFor my familyFor any body that want to check out the blues.This is your hook upClean songsMeaning = songs about Life..( hard times ) good times...and all timesCan ya feel me here..All good.5 STARS...:)"
5,An Alaskan Wonder!,This is my favorite book by Laura DeHart Young so far. What an incredible job she does in helping the reader visualize what life is like in Alaska and the Alaskan pipleline. I read this book from start to finish on the beach and was sorry to see it end. You can't find a better lesbian romance than this one!
5,Excellent boat fenders,These flat fenders are great for slips that are a bit on the tight side as they are flat but still provide excellent protection.
4,Works as intended,"I bought this to upgrade an old Toshiba Satellite 1805 series laptop that had provision for wireless networking but didn't have it (in other words a feature-limited model). I also bought and installed the necessary antennas behind the LCD panel. The upgrade was a complete success, and it was subsequently given to someone else who as far as I know continues to use it to wirelessly monitor their offerings on Craigslist from the comfort of a couch.(What's up with the weird product photo, though, showing what appears to be a networking wall plate? It's certainly not a photo of this Mini-PCI card!)"
5,excellent poetry,"This is a poet not afraid to tackle difficult subjects. She pulls it off by crisp, smart, musical attention to language and detail. You learn something from her poems, and you read them again to enjoy her images, her narratives, her explorations of subject and the power of her words. You can't go wrong here."
5,Don't Let the Title Fool You,"I'm not sure why the author chose as a sub-title, ""52 Virtues For Every Woman."" The packaging suggests it was a marketing decision. Regardless, the readings are equally appropriate for men. This book is a rare gem. The book is packed with biblical wisdom made easier to appropriate through stories. This book has real power to enrich anyone's life who is open to its timeless truths. It has benefitted me personally. An excellent devotional resource. I applaud the author (and illustrator) for this outstanding work."
3,Magical but possibly overpriced,AudioQuest K2 Terminated Speaker CableRequires Engineering (525)Item Level 333Use: K2 Terminated Speaker Cable can shock a dead ally back to life. Cannot be used when in combat. (30 Min Cooldown)Sell Price: 4g
2,"Bought it used, [...], regretted it","I decided to go with a used one [...] (what a steal!) but now that I'm using it, I suspect the metal may have been tarnished by the previous user. When I listen to my mp3s (128kbps, not 96kbps like some idiots) it definitely has richer bass and less of an edge on the vocals. But it's not quite the improvement I expected out of cables [...]. I'm sure it's just because they're used though, so I've ordered a brand new one to see how that compares. I went ahead and ordered 2 just in case on of them get tarnished in the factory - I mean better safe than sorry right?"
2,It's alright...,"I prefer the 100% platinum cables that I bought last week at the reasonable price of $560,000 plus $24 shipping. These just don't have the extra OOMPH I like in my sound. That and the build quality is shoddy on these. Plastic is SO 20th century. Gold fittings are the ONLY way to go for signal clarity and noise reduction. Everyone knows that. These are absolute crap! If I wanted cheap cables, I would have gone to Radio Shack."
1,Disapointed,"I bought these cables to complement my AV DesignHaus Dereneville VPM 2010-1 turntable, Pivetta Opera One 20,000 watt amp, and Acapella Audio Arts Sphaeron Excalibur speakers.I conected it all up and put onPsycho Candyby the Jesus & Mary Chain sat in my specilay positioned chair in my acousticly perfect listening room and cranked it up expecting great things. The sound was terrible. Distorted, tinny with virtualy no middle or bass.Over priced rubish if you ask me."
1,Help for Mp3's ?,Mp3's need all the help they can get. They ruin recordings by removing the high frequencies that the mp3 mongers claim you can't hear anyway. Don't tell me what I can hear. These cables don't make mp3's sound any better. Did you really think they would? But if you spend a penny (remember those) over $8000 you got taken. If you can find these at around $7800 you should stock up.
2,"Good, but nothing special","Okay, mine were used. A guy I know upgraded to a more expensive cable and sold me these for half price; but $3,400 is still expensive. I expected something special to happen after I read all the other reviews; but they were pretty much like the $10 cables they replaced.Do you think they might have been worn out? Maybe all the ""magic"" had been used up? Or maybe all the guys claiming incredible things are lying? Or hallucinating?Anyhow I gave them two stars because they are nice and heavy."
2,there is no 'i' in AudioQuest K2 terminated speaker cable,"I'm sure this is a great product, but my speakers are 9 foot away, and i massively can't be bothered to go and move them. I left the cable on the kitchen table.Also, the packaging has some very racial things stated in it."
4,Wish I had looked here first,"I just paid $8500.00 for the exact same cables at Be$t Buy. I guess I should have looked here first!...Oh yeah, they work as advertised. Good product!"
2,A magical ripoff,"Maybe there are wannabes out there who would pay $6800 for speaker cables but they aren't in my league. I've paid at least twice, thrice and um, more than thrice, times $6800 for speaker cables at my several mansions around the world. $6800 speaker cables? I might use them to hang Christmas lights on my Greenwich mansion, or to serve as chains on my Ferrari when I drive it through the snow in Aspen, Vail or Tahoe. Or for leashes when I walk my Dobermans. Or actually when my dog walkers walk my Dobermans - they growl and bark at me when I go near them. I hear Larry King uses these as suspenders. In Dubai, they call these shoelaces. Chuck Norris flosses with them. $6800 speaker cables? As if."
3,I turned off Amazon's 1-Click Order Feature,"Ok, so I was viewing this product and trying to decide whether it was worth $8,448 more than the $2 speaker cable. At the same time, I turned on the Super Bowl just as Cristina Aguilera began to sing the Star Spangled Banner. I was singing along with Cristina in my mind when I noticed that she sang the wrong lyrics. I was so shocked by this. I mean, who doesn't remember the lyrics to the Star Spangled Banner. The next part is kind of confusing, but I apparently hit the ""1-Click order"" button and the next thing I knew the speaker cable had arrived at my doorstep. It is a very good product and Amazon's speed of delivery was impressive. But I did decide to turn off the 1-Click order feature."
5,Safety Not Guaranteed,Wanted: Someone to retrieve this item that I dropped when travelling back from the future. This is NOT a joke. You'll get paid after I get the cables back. Must bring your own weapons. Safety not guaranteed. I have only done this once before.
3,Excellent high-end audio product,"Very happy with these. The clarity is excellent, with minimum distortion at the top end and powerful, resonant bass frequencies. They create a pleasing warmth from vinyl, and minimise the inevitaable distortion from Mp3. Thoroughly satisfied, and would recommend them to even the most diffident audiophile. I'm not madly happy about the dread dimensional portal to the netherworld that has opened up next to my TV, though."
4,AAA rating from Moody's,"I was looking into these for upgrading my a/v system, and found a review of these in the Spring 2008 issue of Moody's Audio and Mortgage-Backed Securities. These have received Moody's highest rating, AAA!! The system they used to test these based on a Lehman Brothers' amplifier with a Bear-Sterns pre-amp and AIG speakers. It turns out that if you leverage these cable 30x, there's no problem at all. They *are* AAA rated after all.I will have to ding them one star, though. I tried these cables with a Glass-Steagall tube amp, but for some reason, I couldn't get this innovation in audio technology to work. On the other hand, it turns out that if you bundle these cables with inexpensive, less-reliable cables, the audio performance will STILL merit a Moody's AAA rating! It's unbelievable!"
5,Just a whisper,"At the urging of another reviewer, I too listened to the Beatles White Album whilst using these cables. And faintly, ever so faintly, I heard ""buy Tuscan Milk, 128 fl. oz."""
5,OMG- only ONE left,OMG- only ONE left- I gotta wrap this review so I can get my order in asap.... I understand it's hand delivered by the Dali Lama riding a gelded ivory stallion while being serenaded by celestial cherubs.
1,Thanks a lot.,My cats chewed on this cable and now they can both speak. One of them is gay and the other wants to kill me. I would have rather not known.
1,A Classic Bait And Switch,"What a piece of junk. I had a $20 wire roll from Radio Shack and another $14 sunk in banana plugs, and they worked perfectly fine. But I was looking for great, not 'perfectly fine'. So, as any reasonable person would logically conclude, I needed to spend $8,400 on speaker cables.I ordered these babies and hooked them up. They didn't even work! I mean, no sound. Nada. I put back in my old 'shack wires and I got music again. Tried my AudioQuests again, and... nothing.Being the tinkerer that I am, I got out my x-acto knife and cut into the sleeve. The damn thing's full of cocaine! From one end to the other, not one wire in the case. Just 16 feet of cocaine in a fancy package. I dunno if this is supposed to be a grown man's Pixie Stick or something, but I feel cheated."
4,Perfect for ghost hunting.,"Never before have I been able to hear the woman being murdered in the background of The Ohio Players' song ""Love Rollercoaster."" This cable changed all that. A+also great for spiritual presences and ethereal sounds."
3,No HDMI Port,"Seriously, there is no HDMI port built into this product. How is that even possible in the year 2012? HDMIFAIL!"
3,What a great deal!,"I came across the exact same cable for, like, $5k more. I mean, at $6,800, you could almost buy two. Still, it lost two stars because, really, at that price I expect it to at least fold my laundry or something."
2,Tardis Spare Parts,"The apparent high price is simply due to a date input error. Instead of 2012, the date was entered as 2022. Today's equivalent price for this tardis spare part would be $1.50. It appears inflation was the only way out of the 2008+ financial crisis."
1,Garbage.,"Pay the extra $6-thou and forget these lousy knock offs. To the manufacturer's credit, though, they shipped immediately upon reception of my first born child."
4,Here's a tip,"These are amazing, but I do have a tip to save you some $$$. I recommend buying the refurbished model for only $4999.99. It is ALMOST as good as brand new, I compared the used version with my two friends who bought the new one and unless you are a genuine audiophile there is very little difference between the two. The only bummer is that you have to pay for shipping, which almost killed the deal for me but I'm so glad I took the plunge and raided my sister's piggy bank."
1,Important usage warning!,Please ensure that you DO NOT HAVE ANY FISSILE MATERIAL NEAR THIS PRODUCT. The subsequent decay products will muddy the soundstage.Do not taunt AudioQuest K2 Terminated Speaker Cable.
1,Good in a pinch,"Happy with this product. We had to make emergency repairs to our Gxlxthp Drive, and (by Quarphlg!) this was virtually the same as the the official replacement part (lost in a Fizzbin game by our first mate, during that disasterous mission on Philonius M). The quantum alignment needed a little tweaking, but hey, electrons are electrons, so off we go.Also, can be used to jump-start an Army Jeep. Long story there, no time."
2,Not actually terminated at K2,"I ordered these hoping that they would be terminated atK2 (Adventure Press)so I could listen to theMusic of a Sherpa Village. Imagine my disappointment to find they terminated right in my living room. I guess the 8 foot length should have been a tip-off. They do go well with myWalker Edison Everest Multilevel Component Stand, Clear/Silverstereo stand, though.Still, if you are a fan of K2, (Book of the Dead), Mountain (Best of) or related music (At Fillmore EastMountain Jam,Foggy Mountain Breakdown), you could do worse by plugging a 12,000-mile garden hose in one ear and hiring someone to actually terminate the other end at K2. That would sound worse and cost more."
5,amazon verified purchase,I got a whole case of these as a lightening deal at 99.9% percent off. Now I can finally rewire Serenity's engine and get the heck off this rock.Shiny!
4,Great cables for the money!!,"I've been shopping for cables for sometime to hook up to my RadioShack 4440-T Speakers and needed something that would really transmit the full power of my music through them. I almost bought the more expensive K3 cables for $34,000 a pair but the wife was really complaining about the cost so I settled for these. WOW! The fidelity of these are amazing, especially considering I only paid $8,450 a set!!! I may upgrade at some point, but for now these will do.Strangely, two weeks after purchasing these my cancer went into remission and I began growing hair again after 20 years of baldness. I'm not convinced the cables were the cause, but after viewing some of the other reviews I'm starting to wonder."
4,It works...not much else to say,"It's speaker wire. It seems to work fine. What else is there to say? I use these as part of my classroom AV set-up. I tape the cables down and run them up the middle of the classroom. So far they have held up without a problem, even with the occasional student stepping on them, or accidentally placing a chair on them and sitting. No issues at all in the month since i set these up.Update: it has now been 10 months, and still no issues at all. They still work every week for about 20 minutes a week."
1,Are You Kidding?,"One word: ""Optical""This is the most expensive pointless thing I have ever seen in my life. Don't buy. Save yourself $8,400."
2,"Does what it says, I just wasn't ready for it","So you feel you are ready to see The Great God Pan? You feel you can handle the existential questioning that will darken your every waking moment like a very personal thunder cloud? Well, there is only one way to get started and this terminated speaker cable is it."
2,DO NOT BUY,"I picked up a set of these to connect my Coby walkman to a pair of Altec-Lansing Voice of the Theater speakers I have in the back of the Gremlin. Britney sounded pretty good, but the equalization was a little flat for Katy Perry's single ""Teenage Dream"" -- hmm, minus one star.But why do I say DO NOT BUY you ask?After waiting 8 weeks for the $3 rebate to arrive it finally shows up in the form of a VISA PREPAID DEBIT CARD!!!! What's this nonsense??? I was expecting 3 crisp Washingtons to arrive by FedEx. After whipping out that card to pay for four cans of cat food at Wal-Mart I was mortified to have to rummage in my pocket to find the extra 27 cents to make up the difference. I swear I heard the clerk mutter ""High <something> roller"" under her breath."
2,"They're okay, I guess. What do I know?","My husband gave me these cables for Christmas. Sometimes I get the feeling he gets me things HE wants, like that BMW 1200 GS motorcycle and the season court side tickets to Lakers games. Has he forgotten I'm legally blind, for Pete's sake? If it's the thought that counts, I have to ask: what the heck is he thinking? I normally only use an iPad shuffle.As for the cables on the living room stereo, I can't really tell the difference between these and the last ones, even though my near-blindness has supposedly sharpened my other senses. Heck, i still can't tell the difference between a Merlot and a Malbec. So much for heightened senses.Frankly, he may have given me these ridiculous cables because I found out he's sleeping with his new dental hygienist. Other wives might be upset, but...I just found the receipt."
3,It did my taxes for me,"I see that my review must contain at least 20 words about the product. However, everything I have to say about this product is in the title. It did my taxes for me. But I am only giving it three stars because it's too short to be a really good jump-rope."
4,Buy Two and SAVE,"My wife berated me for the high cost of these cables. But, when I pointed out that they were $1600 off the regular price, she sure changed her tune (which the cables rendered with great accuracy). I immediately purchased a second pair, for a savings of $3200, and you should too. We've taken a Caribbean vacation with our little cable-induced nest egg, and hope to buy 3-4 more pair next year for a full-bore African safari. Thank You, AudioQuest!"
1,Electricity's favourite cable?,"While conducting myself through metal, I found myself suddenly feeling... different. Better! It was like flowing through liquid gold, except not quite. I was flowing through the AudioQuest cables. However, my enjoyment only lasted a few nanoseconds, as I soon reached the speakers and was converted into magnetism. You will have to ask the magnetic forces for sure, but I don't think there was any difference in their experience. The cables were for my benefit alone. By the time any sound waves were produced, the experience was forgotten completely. Do your electricity a favour: Buy these cables."
4,Kirk to Enterprise,"Kirk to Spock: cable link successful. My transmitter charged spontaneously and sounds crystal clear. Only downside: Not Federation approved.Beam me up, Scotty."
1,Do not buy these cables,They're TOO good. I plugged these things into my 50W Magnavox 2.1 surround receiver and they impregnated my daughter. And I don't even have a daughter. I had to return them so I can afford the pregnant daughter that my future wife is going to give birth to.

3,"Oh God, why did I enable one-click!?","Dear mom and dad,Despite the well-known magical qualities of the ""AudioQuest K2 terminated speaker cable - UST plugs 8' (2.44m) pair"", I had no intention of purchasing it. The stupid touchpad on your laptop still has tap-clicking enabled. I told you to disable it because it leads to accidental clicking sometimes. But no, you didn't even understand what I was talking about, nevermind the fact that you have no idea where to find the touchpad control panel. Noobs. Well, anyhow, the combination of tap-clicking and Amazon one-click led to this unplanned purchase. I hope you have enough money to cover the credit-card bill, or else you might have to sell the Aries K. On the upside, the cable is said to be able to slay mythical beasts quite easily, so... you know, whatever.Signed,Mike"
5,YES!,Help! They've come to life! The cables... they're... they're eating my daughter! Call an ambulance! Great price though. .. And her screams! I've never heard such crystal clarity! This is totally worth it!
1,Not a good buy,"I received these light bulbs very quickly - packaging was very good for such a fragile item. Unfortunately, the light produced by these light bulbs was a dim, dull amber - not at all as I expected and had always experienced with previous light bulbs of the same wattage and brand. The price, also, was WAY WAY too high. I found better light bulbs at my local hardware store at 1/3 the price. I returned these as I believe they must be defective in some way."
4,The ending isn't that great,"I love this film. It is one of the best Sherlock Holmes. I really like it because I like the Shelock Holmes that follow the original story. For some reason I didn't find the ending that great. The sinpector, followed by Holmes's request just puts a gun up to the man's head and he tells his story. The rest of it is exciting and greatly acted!"
3,"Not a Great ""Pillar.""","Saturnine's full length debut album, ""Wreck at Pillar Point,"" is one of the greatest gloom rock albums ever made. Unfortunately, they've been moving farther away from its sound and style ever since then. ""American Kestrel"" completes their transformation from mopes to bland folkies. This wouldn't be a bad thing if the songwriting were up to their earlier standards. Alas, only ""The Wind is Blowing Like an Outlaw"" is up to their earlier work. The rest of the songs are pleasent enough but ultimately forgettable. Not a ""Slightly Less Than Even"" (from ""Pillar"") in the bunch. Also at 33 minutes, it is a pretty slight effort. I rate it 3 rather than 2 only because none of the songs are actively bad."
1,"It is not a text book, it is a study guide","Well, I have ordered the book and found that it is a study guide. I wonder where can I find the text book."
3,Too thorough and it's clumpsy,"In short, it's too thorough which makes studying this textbook a tough task. You don't know what's important and what's not. Though the general layout of the text is systemetic and unconfusing (definitely you won't find following the author's path difficult), the problem of this books comes from the author's ambition to include a lot in one book and failure to do so by dividing the content into more chapters/sub-chapters. This problem is particularly apparent in the later parts of the book, where different cycles of financial statements are analysed.This is the comment I also heard among many of my fellows at the university. They all agree this is not a good textbook afterall."
4,This book is very usefull for college student,By reading this book we can see all of the auditing process
2,Overrated,"This is how it works: Pust button ones - it turns the lights on, push button again and it turn the lights off. The operating distance is not more than 5 ft, less with anything in the way."
2,YUCK,"I love the 80's, have a huge collection, used to host a 80's music radio show, and have a fairly large video collection. This DVD stinks. First its one of those funny discs that wont play in every player. Second, titles, if I pay this much for music videos I want them clean. And third the quality is poor. I have most of these songs elsewhere and the quality there is much better. I know that video quality in the 80's wasn't always the best, this DVD is worse than the originals. Its a nice collection, but save the cash and buy it on VHS instead."
2,pass this up,"The idea of classic 80's videos being available on DVD is great, but this isn't worth getting."
4,The Good Old Days of Music,"Good DVD. I probably would have chosen other songs for the video collection, but who wouldn't? I bought this one for Come on Eileen and Something About You. Dexy and Level 42 came through. Good quality, clear images. Worth the money, Yes.I would have picked this one for the Tears for Fears videos but I already have them on another DVD."
4,I love 80's music,"I was only a kid during the 80's but I guess listening to the music back then with my mom got me hooked because i still love 80's music. this DVD had a lot of my favorite songs on it like The Look of Love, In A Big Country, and Tempted and it allowed me to see the music videos for them which CDs and radio don't let you do. So if you want to have some 80's nostalgia get this DVD the only problem was that their where only 14 songs but I guess that goes along with the CD they have by the same name"
4,Brought back a lot of memories,"If you just want to relive that era and are willing to overlook the grainy video (especially on a huge TV), then this is worth the $10."
4,A Classic introduction to Orthodoxy,"If you are interested in a foundational understanding of the Orthodox Christian faith, start here. Father Ware does an excellent job in tracing the history of the Orthodox religion from the beginning days to the post-Berlin wall times. While some of the history is difficult to follow, it establishes an underpinning of why the Orthodox religion has endured virtually unchanged from the days of Acts.While the first half of the book deals with history, the second the the real meal here: Father Ware discusses the major tenants of what it means to be Orthodox. While his book didn't touch me as personally as Frederica Matthewes-Green's, it convinced me that there's much more to the Orthodox faith than I ever imagined."
4,Good on History,"Overall this is a good book. As far as teaching about what the church believes, I would recommend others instead. If you are interested in the history of the church though, I have yet to find one that explains it better."
3,"Good, but Divisive","Overall, this is an excellent introduction to modern Eastern Orthodoxy. However, I think that there are some serious flaws in it. As a Latin-rite Catholic myself, I was struck by the method by which Timothy Ware constantly picks out the most minute differences between Eastern Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism, and then gives detailed criticisms of the Western tradition (although he may be slightly vindicated by the fact that he is often just reporting many of the attitudes of modern Orthodoxy). To the reader, (and sadly this is the case in a lot of Orthodox circles) it seems that that Western theological positions or modes of worship are either scorned or condemned for simply not being Eastern. This attitude is exemplified in the content of the book's Introduction. One gets the impression that the writer is concerned to define Orthodoxy, not by what it is, but by what it is not."
4,Good Basic Information on Eastern Orthodoxy,"This book is certainly a good reference for learning about this denomination. It gives a lot of history, and tells how Eastern Orthodox Christians view Protestants and Roman Catholics. It also gives good insights as to HOW this denominatation came up with their beliefs, which has a different methodology from other branches of Christianity. As a native American, I found the names of cities, people, and countries to make the reading tedious at times. Readers who are more familiar with the history of Eastern Europe would undoubtedly find it easier reading than I did."
5,Excellent introduction to the Orthodox Church,"A friend of the family gave me a copy of 'Journey' by Peter France which tells the story of how he discovered Orthodoxy after many years of being an atheist. A true cynic, France was left cold by many of the religions he read about. But finally he was so inspired by Orthodoxy that he had himself baptised on the island of Pathos.That book inspired me and in it France mentions 'The Orthodox Church', so I decided to buy a copy.It is an excellent introduction to Orthodoxy. The historical background is both essential and fascinating. The explanation of faith and worship is relatively easy to understand and what struck me the most is how much religion has been intellectualised. But that this is essential to the practice of the faith.If Orthodoxy is of interest you, look no further than this book."
5,Started me on my jouney,"I just bought the book to get some kind of understanding of the Orthodox faith, and this book gave me that and a lot more.The book for me personally was somewhat of a journey into learning about a faith I knew almost nothing about. I truly got into reading this book in Oct. 2003, and ended up getting Baptized in the Orthodox Church in Jan. 2004. That alone kind of speaks volumes about the book's impact on my life."
4,An excellent religious history,"If you want to know about the history of the Eastern Orthodox Church, this is the book you need to read. It is a must for potential converts, as it contains one of the finest in-depth studies of the subject."
4,Comprehensive & Detailed,"The book is divided into 2 parts. First is a detailed history of the Orthodox church which naturally includes world history as well. It can get rather ""heady"" in this section. The 2nd part is much more geared to theology and the praxis of the Orthodoxy. Much more readable for the layman.I would not recommend this book for an inquirer just beginning to investigate Orthodoxy unless they had a degree in theology. However, for someone who has been around the faith it is a comprehensive review of its history and practice."
4,Good Introduction to Orthodoxism,This book was exactly what I was looking for -- an introduction into the beliefs of the Orthodox Church and how it differs from the Roman Catholic Church. Concise and precise. I enjoyed reading it and it is a good research book.
5,Incredibly coherent summation of christian theol. & pract.,"A must read for anyone even remotely interested in religion. Written with love for the orthodox church and compassion for other christian churches. Provides a refreshing investigation into the mystical aspects of Faith in contrast with the bookish literalism of recent fundamentalists and the scholastic dogmatism of Roman Catholocism, (of whom I am one). A great, insightful contribution aimed for the 20th century reader."
4,The First Step Toward Understanding Orthodox Christianity,"This is an excellent work which provides the reader a very good history of Orthodox Christianity. If one is a searcher, by that looking to find a new church home after becoming disenchanted with the various demoninations in the Western Church, then this should be on one's reading list.Bishop Ware does not push any of the various Orthodox jursidictions in his work. What he has done is given a very solid history of Orthodox Christianity along with the basic tenents of Orthodox faith."
4,This was life.,"Of course this is a classic, the life of the dust bowl migration families is described in brilliant detail. My only difficulty was the ending that just - ended, seemingly in mid-sentence. If you hate details, or need a finished end, don't read this. If you want to eat, breathe and feel life in the 30s, pick this up and you won't put it down."
5,Human despair leads to acts of love and of violence,"While on the road, the Joads encounter much that challenges their concept of brotherly love. They are expertly placed in situations where they are forced to make critical value judgments that will impact upon their self concepts for their lives. These circumstances and experiences are so real to the reader that he or she cannot help but to be affected as well. Was ever a more touching scene written than when Rose of Sharon climbsout of her deserved despair to nourish the beleagured stranger? Superb"
3,This is a once-read book,This is a book that you should read at least once. It gives you facts on American History and how people lived. You learn a lot from this book but consider reading this book when you are in your late teens. Some of its contents are not understood until you are in high school. Everyone should read this once in their life.
3,Well Written but Idiotic,"The reading of this book was not tedious, but the stupidity of the family was"
1,Worthy of even 1 star?!!!!!,"This book was one of the slowest books I have ever read. Save your money and your time, by not reading this book."
1,Burn it!!,"I normally don't support book burning, but for this book I'll make an exception! I have never read a book at horrible as this one. Every other chapter was absolutely meaningless. I suppose you could argue that a wheat shaft in the wind has purpose, but I just don't care. This book is better than NyQuil!"
1,Pure American hokum,"Though I've read many bad books, none can compare with this trite, contrived piece of work. Every line, every word, is deliberate and pretentious--Steinbeck is pounding it into our collective consciences at every step that this is a great work of art. People have called this book propaganda, but that doesn't even begin to cover it. Nowhere else will you find such schmaltzy dialogue, or such a laborious, falsely deep message. But I recommend everyone read this book, just to get a taste of what absolute tripe millions of people are capable of swallowing."
1,I don't recommend this book,"This book was one of the most incrdibly boring books that i have ever read. Steinbeck goes back and forth from the Joads, to the entire migrant population. It was extremely confusing because in the migrant chapters, he would use quotation marks. It sucked."
5,Neglected gem,Riding the Musical Chariot is an early but excellent Heartbeat rock steady compilation. Derrick Harriott is not as well known as superstar Jamaican producers Duke Reid of Treasure Island or Coxsone Dodd of Studio One but his work was first rate. Harriott takes lead vocal on two of the tracks here but the real gems are the four tracks he produced for the the unjustly neglected duo of Keith and Tex. CD also contains two very good songs by the Ethiopians and some hard to find material by the Kingstonians. Harriott's crack studio band - the Crystalites - contributes some sizzling instrumentals as well. Fans of the golden era of rock steady will love this music.
2,A weaker flame,I found these performances lacking in the passion and drive I think this music demands.I remain unclear about both the numbering and edition of the sonatas recorded.
4,Marriage of simplicity and power,"As David Gelertner points out, most of us implicitly hold that scientists and artists are radically different by craft and by the very nature of their work. In fact, the scientific and artistic personalities seem to overlap more than they differ. Beauty and simplicity are the ultimate defense against complexity, and all the greatest discoveries are usually both simple and powerful - they are beautiful. Whether it is software, or product design, or even theoretical physics, best solutions have an aura of elegance and beauty that is often overlooked by our schools and colleges; as David Gelernter points out, our sole focus on analytical reasoning is leading us down the wrong path, and we need to address this issue on an emergency basis."
2,"Starts strong, but runs out of steam fast","I would agree with many of the statements made by the others who have reviewed the book. The first few chapters are strong, and I felt like it was really going somewhere. But the irksome, constant worshipping of the Macintosh desktop as the paragon of machine beauty really gets on ones nerves.The designs for computer enclosures are somewhat interesting, but they have a very distinct back-of-the-napkin quality to them. They are neither well-thought-out nor particularly well illustrated in the book itself.I am currently reading Interface Culture (Steven Johnson) and more thought has gone into each chapter of that book than all of Machine Beauty combined.If you're looking for a brief and slanted history lesson on the microcomputer revolution, ending in 1984 when the Mac made its debut, then this book is a easy read, but there are much better books out there if you're looking for thought provoking material."
3,Ok......but......,A much nicer sounding 2disc version(5000 limited edition)which was released on Aug 26th 2005 is available....which incudes some great tracks that are missing from this & other releases(Satisfaction-Dungaree Doll-I Can't Give You Anything But Love-Be Bop A Lula-Goldmine In The Sky-Singing The Blues)......google is your freind.Disc 1 -1.

3,What a frustrating dissapointment!,"This is a GREAT album. Of all the ""London Sessions"" lps from this period, this is one of the best. Problem is, the sound quality on this version is very poor. Sounds to me like it was taken from vinyl, and old, dirty, badly tracked vinyl at that. What is the problem with this? I sent to Lemon records, but they did not respond. Is there some reason why masters could not be located? Did no-one even have a copy of the Reel-To-Reel version which was released at the superior 7 & 1/2 IPS speed? That might have done almost as well as a master tape-it sounded great. This thing is an embarrassment. This album was released previously on CD, but several tracks were removed, and the order changed-but it sounded fine for it's day; clearly taken from a respectable master tape of some kind. Shame on Lemon for messing up such a classic! Wake up, UNIVERSAL! Do this one right will you?"

5,a bonanza of practical information,"An exciting book, full of unusual ideas, practical information, and intriguing possibilities. Real treasure."
1,Music Man,"This CD-KC's greatest hits has about only 5 songs that were hits. The sound quality is poor. Sounds like the singing was recorded in a tin can. The songs sound like they were recorded in a low budget bar. It's all mono tone and parts are ad-lib singing, not original hits from a studio. This CD is not re-mastered, it's more like re-disastered."
2,toooo much packaging!,I bought this product about a month ago and was really put off by the amount of unecessary packaging that comes with it. It's a huge box full of filler plastic- all for a little DVD game. The games were pretty fun but the packaging was a deterrance to that.
3,"Mini is Better than Movie, but Still Lacking","Well, the Mini-Specials are far better than the movie with its dark tone, but there's still something missing in the series. It's like the magic the OAV's had has never quite been recaptured in the TV series, movie, or mini-specials. To be sure, You're Under Arrest works much better in small doses. However, towards the end, the Mini-Specials grow redundant (how many times can they crack jokes about people seeing the cross dressing officer's ""thingie""?) and the plots never vary much from their formulas of panty thieves and/or teaching egotistical citizens a lesson (although the designers come up with good ideas to change the settings and scenarios slightly). Although it has good animation and voice acting, I think I had already seen everything that Miyuki and Natsumi would see in their daily lives before I watched this."
2,Poor controls and camera angles,The graphics in this game are great. They have made a lot of progress in the controls but the PC controls are very very poor! The grapple control is completely impossible to aim!!! The camera angles are frustrating. You end up looking at the back of Lara's head when you want to look at where you are trying to go. I love the tomb raider series but this is a disappointment.
2,I HATE THE CAMERA ANGLES!!!!!!!,"i made this impulse buy thinking it would live up to, if not, be a successor to the ps1 console game i used to play some 10 years ago. after playing a few levels in, i'm finding myself very annoyed with the lack of control i have over lara's movement. more specifically because of the free-to-move-against-player's-will camera angles.to further elaborate on that, the camera's position dictates the direction that lara moves in. so for example if you're having lara pull a box toward a wall, the camera angle will change if the camera gets too close to the wall, then lara ends up pulling the box in a different direction, if not starts to rotate the box instead. i'm shocked that this flaw in gameplay was allowed to be released.multiply that by the voice actor tracks that repeat itself each time you clumsily fail between checkpoints, it throws more salt on the wound.whoa, did you see that thing that flew out the door just now?? i'm pretty sure that was the REPLAY VALUE!"
4,Good Game,"I like this game pretty good! I like the graphics, I like the levels, and the puzzles. Some times the controls get in the way, but it is easy to control.Controls 3/5Graphics 5/5Game Play 5/5Over All 4/5"
4,Really good.,"I must say that I really enjoy the Tomb Raider series of games and this was so much better than Angel of Darkness it was incredible.I personally think that Tomb Raider Chronicles was the best one and do not know if they will ever be able to make one better, but this is close."
5,lara is back and better than ever!,"this is one of the best tomb raider's ever! i love the story, it's much better then i thought it would be. the graphics are amazing. the gameplay is kinda hard to get used to, but in a few hours you should get it, it's actually better than the first few. i love that you get to explore her mansion in detail... you never got to do that in the others, well not as much. the music is great. and it's alot easier than all the other titles. the scenery is amazing, you get to go to like 6 different places, and there all done pefectly.now the downside is... it only has like 8 levels. well and thats it. not much. it's really a great game, and anybody who says otherwise is completely crazy!if you loved the others, you have to get this... you wouldn't believe how great it is!oh, and it works on vista... even better than xp."
2,PC controls ruined the whole game.,I really think that new PC controls are really a bad idea and I hope Eidos comes up with a patch that can restore to traditional controls. It is important to remember that controlling camera angles using a mouse only works for some games but for TRs.
2,Started off well but the save system will screw you...,"Unless you have mad button pushing skills, skip this game. It's an excellent return to clasic Tomb Raider form... like TR III the save system ensures that you will hit some obstical that you will do over and over and over and over and over again until you are ripping your hair out with frustration."
1,TERRIBLE game!,"I am a fan of the TR series, but this game is absolutely HORRIBLE!! The controls are terrible, and you spend alot of time looking at the back of her ponytail! You cannot adjust the camera angles and the controls are VERY sluggish and I have a Bad-A machine with the latest hardware. The puzzles are almost impossible to solve unless your timing is A-1 PERFECT!!! Once you pass the introductory level, the game is short and is over before you know it. If you must buy this game, wait awhile until it goes on sale, unless you just have money to waste! EDIOS needs to get it's act together if they have a sequel because it can't get much worse!"
2,"For God Sakes, get a new engine already!","With games like Half-Life,Fear and Far Cry out there, TR-L just cannot compete. For God Sakes, upgrade the graphics engine! This game look little differnt than all the previous ones. And the controls are God awful too."
4,Not as bad as some say,"This game certainly puts a whole different spin on Tomb Raider games. If you're a DIE HARD Laura Croft fan then this game is for you. I haven't played any Tomb Raider's since Tomb Raider II on Playstation 1 and I STILL liked this game. Most reviewers say it was a horrible game, but I certainly enjoyed it. I like solving puzzles in a sense that you become part of the puzzle and this game does exactly that."
1,Tomb Raider Legend Legendary Bust,This is by far the worst in the Tomb Raider series. The controls are impossible and the action lame. The 'auto sight' for targeting never seems to work even if you're right on top of an assailant. It seems the designers tried to make the game more 'Movie' like and forgot that it's just a game. It's supposed to be fun not laborious. The controls for fighting are more frustrating than fun. The designers should go back to what works and modify the character and action from Tomb Raider Revelation.
4,DANG! .....was it that bad for some of you,"My problem with it is that its short and she runs too slow and a few littl minor stuff but nothing really to coomplain about...I like that strategy, puzzles (didn't really find them puzzling) riding the bike and others things...At the end of the day i enjoy myself, they didn't do a bad job they did an OK job know won't know what you think of they game until you play it"
3,A Bit Disappointing,"Well I am not a game expert or top notch player. I play for fun to kill some time. I have played all the past TR games, and enjoyed them. First of all with Legend, I thought the improved graphics were almost breathtaking, almost brought Lara to life. Although if you do not have a recent system it will slow you down. I was really frustrated with the new controls though, it took me a bit to just to be able to move around efficiently. I miss some of the old safeguards for us NON-professional game players, like being able to walk up to a edge without falling off. Quick saves and loads. Being able to collect multiple health packs and flares to use when you really need them.I felt it needed more backstory, and more interesting levels. All in all its almost worth buying for the graphics alone. Nice to finally see Lara looking more realistic. But Edios needs to work on their storyboards, and control interface to make the game playable for all levels of gamers."
4,Mark Bando's Breakout at Normandy/2nd Armored Div.,"An excellent book, with many pictures I've never seen before. Bando interviewed hundreds of veterans for this book, and I think it's his best work yet. I'm an avid History Channel watcher, and I'd never heard of the battle that Bando researched for this book, despite the fact that it was one of the most terrifying of the war. The book's best attribute is it's anecdotal aspect. Bando does a good job describing the courage displayed by both sides in this confict through the words of men who fought it. The detective work is great, and Bando even catches more well known historians in several errors."
3,CD 15 cracked and split when I tried to remove it from the box set. Be careful!,CD 15 cracked and split when I tried to remove it from the box. Be careful - the left hand sides have the CDs jammed in tightly and they seem unusually brittle. Unfortunately I have been in hospital and the return period expired last week. good luck. The CDs that played were of course wonderful.
5,Raheim just irks me but I'm lovin that man.,"This and Bboy blues are my favorite books.. I also have to admit that this is the first Gay book I read and i was quite taken by it. there's a lot of conflict which interests the reader, and it beautilly entices the reader to want to know what's gonna happen next.Raheim and Little Bit make a good couple, vry mature.. very REALISTIC! and I think this is great, I love it.. the front cover is beautiful, great job!"
2,Sophomoric Sequel,"Hardy's second book in the Raheim River's story is a watered down drink compared to the earlier ambrosia of B-Boy Blues. This book, similar to E. Lynn Harris's second novel, is told through two voices--Raheim and Mtichell's. Hardy's split of storytellers destroys the book's flow. What is worst is that Raheim's dialogue is unconvincing. Instead of sounding like a rough street man, his thoughts read exactly like Mitchell's-- only with slang. Unfortunately, this book does not have the same sexy presence of the highly erotic previous novel. Some people argued that B-Boy Blues was too sexy, almost pornographic, and it appears that Hardy didn't want readers to similarly crticize this novel. 2nd Time Around lacks eroticism and tastyness--flavor. Hardy needs to rethink where he wants Raheim and Mitchell to go, and then seriously decide the best method to tell their story."
4,love story with real people working on real problems,"It is good to read a book that so honestly deals with love between men (who make love, rather than have sex). It feels 'real', deals with blood and sweat people. Written with passion and kindness. Highly recommended."
1,2nd Time Around Isn't Always The Best Time,I was filled with excitment as I opened the pages to 2nd Time Around. This excitement soon turned into boredom. Mr. Hardy did not live up to the expectations of the fans that he won with B Boy Blues.2nd Time Around was the wrost book that I have read in years. There were several times when I wasn't sure what was happening. This was becasue the book lacked a plot or a story line. The relationship between all the characters was so unrealistic that I almost regurgitated. Little Brother Man's brithday party was the most unrealistic.2nd Time Around also adds to the discrimination of effeminate Black men by constantly making derogatory comments about them.Mr. Hardy should have given this book away on some street cornor in Compton where I'm sure no one would have read it.
3,My least favorite of the 5,"Really, this book ain't all that bad, but it appealed to me the least of all of the series so far. I honestly couldn't put my finger on what disappointed me so much. I did enjoy the look into his past, but after reading it twice, I am still left with no desire to read it again. At first, I thought it was Pooquie's narration that annoyed me, but after reading the 4th novel in the series, I ruled that out. My suggestion would be that all fans of the first novel definitely read this one, but only so they can better understand the 3rd novel. Don't get your hopes up over liking this one, but definitely don't avoid it."
3,ok for the theme,"The Disney Cars I purchased were ok for the money.When I say ok I am meaning,yes there were several for the money which in turn seems like a better deal.However the cars are very cheaply made,the McDonald Cars are way better made than these.So my advice to you would be go ahead and pay the extra for the more expensive Cars or hunt down the ones from Mickey D's."
2,Tractor and Guido break easily,This is not made for kids. The tractor's front wheel has broken right off as well as Guido's front arm broke off too. I had to superglue them back together multiple times. These are not meant to be played with by kids!
3,Get Back to En Vogue!,"It's not that it's bad, it's just not as great as it could have been. Lucy Pearls voice is not as strong as when she sang with her girls. The song has meaningful lyrics but when the boys start to rap, it looses it's cool"
2,Poor subtitles,"After watching the full set of the ""Varg Veum"" series, I must say I do agree with the disappointing reviews. As mentioned, there is a great deal of room for improvement in the script.. and also in some of the performances. But the most disappointing to me was the very uneven translation, full of errors in basic sentence structure, literal and awkward, and with several highly objectionable slurs. For awhile, I wondered if the translation was trying to be authentic to UK English, or to a character, but ultimately it's just a poor, distracting translation-- so bad, I really wished I could return this series! Watch some of the great Norwegian movies that Amazon offers instead!"
5,A Globe for All Seasons,"Jeff Greenwald is the kind of traveler most people rightly want to be--insouciant, funny, compassionate and cyncal at the same time. He's seems to have been just about everywhere (I'm sure he'd scoff at that), and seen it all, but most of all one gets from his writing a special sense of hope. He clearly loves the world and all its inhabitants--and in the manner in which the whole wild and poignant panoply of life pains and delights him, he brings the reader to their own natural place of wonder. Even better (I've read three of his other books), I always find myself Greenwalded into an eddy of determination not only to make my own next trip real, but when I'm on it, to be a better observer and a better participant in the magic all about me."
3,Good when he's not patting himself on the back...,"As an aspiring travel writer myself who just returned from 14 months around the world, I skimmed this book to get a sense of Greenwald's style, where he's been, and how he views the world. I found the writing to be really good when he wasn't so busy sharing all the great things he's done and how much he likes himself. There's an air of self-aggrandizement that gets in the way of the stories. If he could just take a more humble approach, I'd be more intrigued and inspired. To be perfectly honest, a part of me is jealous of Greenwald for having visited many of these places in the '90s before they became so overtouristed. Overall I think he does a great job of offering pertinent historical facts and great backgrounds that make the experience so much more real and interesting. He just needs to get off his high horse."
4,Jeff Greenwald is one of my favorite writers but..,"if you have read his other books, you will have read about half of these stories already."
4,Nice game,"This is a good game but i think the graphics could have been sharper but other than that it is a good game, but any way 3 disks for [price] is a good deal and its a pretty good game so if u like hunting you should buy this. Also, i like how u can go target practice on clays in the target range."
4,Easy and fun,"I have Big Game Hunter III and recently bought this game. Once again, EA sports comes through with flying colors, as this game is easy to play and has great graphics. And it's a great price for 3 CD's."
1,Not what I ordered,I ordered the soup plate as shown....which is more of a very shallow soup bowl. What I received was a saucer plate for a coffee cup. I was getting married and leaving for my honeymoon and did not have the opportunity to save the packaging and return it. Very dissappointed.
5,FSM!,I love my Flying Spagetti Monster keychain. It's small but still noticable. I have a blast explaining to people what it means.
2,tiny and fragile,"I bought this as a joke for a friend who appreciates the FSM web site. The keychain is very small and not particularly attractive. If it were about 50% larger, it might be more interesting.Update- after a few months, the FSM has broken off the keychain and disappeared :(. Not very durable at all."
4,"Quality was good, but smaller than expected...","...that's what she said?All joking aside, this likeness of his noodliness is much smaller than I thought it would be. $15 for a keychain that is barely the size of a quarter?! At least the quality is good."
5,Excellent buying!,"Compact, well design, powerful, light and small. Perfect for travel, concerts. Fits ins small bags. Ideal for woman! Love it!"
4,Good buy for the price,"After researching the ones for toddlers, I settled on this set of binoculars for my two year old granddaughter. She likes to go out with her dad to look at birds, visit the zoo and such. She loves his and now has one of her own. The magnification works ok and that was an issue with the ones for toddlers. It stayed in one piece and will be used under supervision. Overall, I am pleased with the product."
3,Binoculars,"They're a little too small to be conveniently used, and the two eyes require separate focusing. However, they are very easy to carry and are adequate for many purposes. If you're not looking for anything fancy, these are a good buy."
5,I love this CD !!,"I purchased this CD because of the excellent reviews in Downbeat and Jazz Times. This is a reissue of a date done by Dave in the late 1950's in a trio setting. I am most familiar with Dave in a solo setting, thus I was blown away by this performance. If you love Jazz piano as much as I do, GET THIS. It ranks with my Bill Evans trio stuff as all time faves, and this swings harder!"
1,Buyer beware,"Purchased one of these American Qosmio's, and imported it to New Zealand. The Qosmio lasted just one month longer than its one year international warranty and then the motherboard died. I have always liked Toshiba but after wasting so much money on one I will never get another.Pro's- Very nice looking machine loaded with features, nice sound (for a laptop), and very clear and bright screen.Cons- noisy fan, runs hot which probably contributed to the short lifespan .Power supply also gets very hot.Toshiba mobile services NZ wanted to charge me $1500.00 for a replacement motherboard and provide just a three month warranty on the repair. Toshiba eventually repaired the laptop free of charge, but by this time I had replaced it with another laptop (not as flashy but hopefully much more reliable). As much as I loved the Toshiba following the ""system enhancement"", I decided to sell it on because of my negative experience."
1,DON'T buy this book,"This book is horribly written, little plot, horrible character development. Similar to a romance novel. So I guess if that's what you're looking for, go for it. It was one of the worst books I""ve ever read."
3,Type,"While I have just begun to read this book and so cannot comment on the content, I have to say I am very disappointed in the quality of the type used. It is not a uniform black type and is very unpleasant to read and cheaply done."
5,Perfect for my students,"This spelling dictionary is a great tool for students I see in my occupational therapy practice. The concise format works well for the average student learning how to read, write and spell. Also comes in handy for students with dyslexia and visual motor challenges. Each letter section also has empty spaces for students to add their own high frequency words, and separate sections for words in categories, such as days of the week and months. A fantastic tool!"
3,big duck!,"Bought three of these assumming they were going to be ""bite size"" ducks, like the ones I have purchased in the past. Opened the package to find they were the size of a small dog. the Wife and I laughed until we cried. Ironically, our dog loves the new duck(s) which are half the size of our dog. LOL"
3,odd but good,"To concentrate on the unbelievable elements of the plot is to miss the point I think. I'm not sure what the point is, but it's a funny film, and the characters are certainly interesting. Ludivine Sagnier is superb as Anna, Franz's ex-girlfriend.You could do a lot worse, and you could do a lot better."
3,questing for the other reviews,is this the same movie that harry harris put out on vhs? if so i will buy this dvd. please let me knoe.amanda
3,Too repitious!,"Bought this because I heard a short portion at my chiropractor's office and loved it. If you were into chanting, this might be what you want. I thought they would vary it a bit- not so."
2,June Wesley,"I found this CD mind-numbingly boring to the nth degree and supremely wish I'd never squandered my money on such a monotonous, repetitious, and excrutiatingly irritating rendetion of a piece of music which needs no such affectatious imbellishment! The addition of these words actually reduces the pleasure received from listening to the piece unadorned (ie, it was like fingernails on a blackboard)."
4,Sorry I can not find it,I love the monster cable ultra capacity charger. toot bad I can not find it anymorethe one is for sale does not have a good review and they do not have more of it. Just in case it goes bad.my existing one is good until somebody place a alkaline battery in it by mistake.Will monster will be able to fix it?
2,Easy Break-In,"I bought three of these boxes for our neighborhood about two years ago. Two have since been replaced with more secure boxes. The last remaining is about to go after being broken into for the third time.The box was a cost effective choice and I would like it but for the fact that it is NOT secure. A simple screw driver can pry it open.Once the thieves figure this out, they appear to just bring the ""key"" on their ""mail route"". The two other replacement boxes, two different brands, were untouched.Since the point of these boxes is security, I cannot recomend someone get this box. It can prevent someone from just walking past and taking your mail on a whim. But anyone intent on mail theft can get in quickly and easily."
4,Quality Mailbox,"This is a very high quality mailbox with heavy gauge metal, careful seam work, and excellent finish. I only wish the door was designed for larger boxes and the lock compartment was in the back."
2,Not for packages,We had the same issues as another reviewer. We order things online and wanted a mailbox that would accept packages and keep them secure. This was not it. Then we found the mailbox design we were looking for at mailsafeincorporated dot com. Perfect-- I wish we had found it first.
3,Doesn't accept some USPS priority mail boxes,"I bought this mailbox because I order frequently online and receive most of my packages in USPS priority mail boxes. Boy, was I disappointed to find some priority boxes wouldn't fit. While the opening is big enough to accept the priority mailboxes, the way the ""hopper"" is constructed keeps them from being deposited. Otherwise, I would have rated this mailbox 5 stars. Note: this does NOT refer to the Junior model."
1,Mail Stolen From This Box,My mail was just stolen from this box. Theives popped it open like a top. There is a design flaw that allows for easy access with a screwdriver at minimum to bust the door off. My neighbors both have different syle boxes than mine and their mail boxes were uncompromised. If you care about criminals accessing the contents of your mailbox do not buy this box.
2,Not as secure as you might think,I went to our local hardware store to look at the Oasis. The clerk in the store was explaining how it worked to another customer and I was looking on. When he opened the ingoing mail door (not the locked portion) I stuck my hand in through the opening and pulled out the mounting hardware box and mounting instructions that are in the bottom of the mailbox. Needless to say neither I or the other customer bought this product.
3,Oasis Good...customer service bad,Nice mailbox. Too bad there's ZERO customer service. I'd like some replacement locks and magnets. Can't get any email or phone response - just a continuous busy signal.
5,Oasis Mailbox,This is a large mailbox and worth the extra cost. It is more secure than the ones I have looked at in the local Lowes and Home Depot! It is easy to install and looks great at the roadside edge.
4,advanced schutzhund,"Very informative,reviews some of the basic training principles. Some Q&A on training.I would rate this book up the with other quality Gun dog books.This book is not to advanced for the new trainer. It was put together well from basic to advanced training."
5,Fantastic for schutzhund or even competative obedience,"Great book on working a dog using drives (mainly play, prey) and positive techniques. Much better than adversive schutzhund techniques. Lots here for the competative obedience person or anyone working a high-drive dog. Highly recommended."
3,Great H&O footage but be aware!,"I bought this after a long time of intending to. i had watched the VHS copies of these back in the day and loved them.The Live at the Apollo is of course great to have and no complaints. the problem is with the Rock N' Soul concert. on this dvd, there is some annoying editing. perhaps to be able to cram everything on one dvd, i don't know. but the beginnings of some songs are cut off or just plain edited in an obvious spot.SO, with that, anyone that has loved the original Rock N' Soul VHS, keep this in mind if wanting this. it's great to have in some form at least, but still, a better job could have been done.why this hasn't been released on dvd 'officially' up to this point is beyond me. hall and oates are doing well and this is a great capture of them at their peak in the 80's."
5,Another Strong Performance,"Hello All, this is another Great DVD, showing Hall and Oates at their very best. Soloist performances by Charlie DeChant make this a memory keeper."
3,20% new stories,"This book is written by the most famous Hanoch Teller, and if you like his special style of writing, you will like this book too. BUT, if you have read most of his books, don't grab this one. It's excellent for new readors only, since 80% is old stuff combined in a new format."
2,Sound engeneer where are you?,"The sound quality is horrendous, Mana make a lot of money off there fans I could not believe my ears. I end up play the cd and the videos Simultaneously to be happy.A live concert DVD is needed MANA."
5,Mana- Exitos en video,This video is great and it really has a good view you could see each video clearly and I recomend it to all Mana lovers. Mana is my favorite spanish rock group and they rock. Ther songs are all cool and some are beautiful and have a very nice message. To me all Mana songs remind me about my boyfriend Antonio and that's one of the many reason I like Mana.
5,Great information and insight into this devastating disease!!,"I could not put this book down. This book gives great information and insight about this devastating disease. Not only do you read about somone's journey through the addiction into recovery but you learned alot of useful facts. I think this book is good for someone suffering from this addiction so they know they are not alone, their loved ones, and anyone working with people with this addiction. I will recommend this book to my students, patients and their families. !!!"
4,Good Wrap Up,"I liked this book. Even though some of it was hard to take, the whole situation with Carrie was real hard to take. I was glad that she finally decided to share the burden with the family. I was super glad that Conner was such a big shoulder to lay her head on. That was a wonderful silver lining to the book. Then there was Asia and Lance. The whole situation between them was super hot. I loved the way he schemed to be next to Asia. Then the way they interacted on the island was such a blessing that it must have been love. I felt bad about John but it would have never worked, too much all in the family. It was a great book and I look forward to the chance to read about Logan and Lyle."
4,Great!,This was a great book in my opinion. Brenda Jackson does it again. You will never be disappointed if you read any of her books. They always keep you turning the pages wanting more. Never a dull moment when you read any of Ms. Jackson's books. Read the book you won't be disappointed.
5,Loved this One!,I love the story of Dr. Lance Montgomery and Dr. Asia Fowler! It was exciting reading whether or not they were going to get together. I would love to spend a week or two on Paradise Island myself. I loved reading about Conner and Carrie (Lance's sister) as well and the twist on her story is shocking. I would love to read more about the Montgomery clan. We also have to find out what happens to Claire Fowler (Asia's sister). Does a Montgomery brother have eyes for her?
4,Loved It,Brenda has done it again. I'm a huge fan of Mrs. Jackson and loved the sequel to THe Playa's Handbook. Keep up the good work!!!
5,Loved it!,"This book is one of Brenda's best along with its prequel The Playas Handbook, you got to read that one first to get the background.Looking forward to reading about Lyle and Logan's story even Sean has a potential love interest waiting for him and please get someone for their Dad he deserves it. Bring it on Brenda!"
1,AVOID ANY PRODUCT BY SURROUND RECORDS ! ! !,"Just look at some of the reviews for this or any of their other blu ray discs: about half are raves about how nice they sound....and the other half are from users complaining that the disc does not play in X player!I've now tested several discs with the latest firmware, and they are indeed garbage. Amazon should pull all of the product from this company. Why would anyone want to deal with a company whose product only works in about 50% of players? I've never seen something so ridiculous or shoddy in my 10+ years of purchasing discs from hundreds of manufacturers.BEWARE: DO NOT PURCHASE ANY PRODUCT FROM THIS COMPANY!"
1,Faulty Discs Received Twice,"I have received two copies of this recording and both were missing the same short (20 sec) section of the Concerto #3. Amazon would not replace it a second time, so I kept it since my main interest is the Concerto #2. There may be a flaw in one batch of discs - BUYER BEWARE. Listen to it all the way through before you keep it if you want more than the Concerto #2. In all fairness, I must say the sound of the recordings was outstanding. However, I consider an incomplete recording, none at all."
1,Check DVD,"Will not play on my new LG BD-370 Blu-ray player,After downloading upgrade from LG , still will not play, returned DVD."
1,NOT POSSIBE - DIDN'T PLAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this item from Newbury Comics and it didn't play in my PS3 or in SONY blu-ray player. I send a message from Newbury Comics asking what I can do, but i didn't receive contact from them. I purchased in the same date a Blu-ray from Hissarlikway (Pinocchio (Two-Disc 70th Anniversary Platinum Edition + Standard DVD+ BD Live) [Blu-ray]) and fuctioned perfectly.I lived in Brazil the same area of USA for blu-ray.Thanks for help,Ronaldo12/09/2009"
4,Full of Enthusiasm and Joy,"This CD is a re-release of a studio album recorded in 1966. Handy's alto sax is joined on this outing by the violin of Michael White, the guitar of Jerry Hahn, the bass of Don Thompson, and the drums of Terry Clarke. For me, it is Hahn who really makes this session take off, but the rest of the musicians are certainly no slouches, either. This is music that sounds young and vital, full of enthusiasm and sheer joy. If you missed the LP when it was originally released on Columbia three decades ago, now is your time to make amends, and you will be rewarded with three bonus cuts that did not appear on the original vinyl. No, John Handy never became a big star, but judging from his early recordings, he certainly had the talent."
3,americana quilt,I like this pattern but not the color choice so I changed it to a pink and burgundy haven't finished it yet so no pictures.
5,Quilt Blocks,I am very happy with the fast services I received for these quilt blocks. They arrived on time and now have them completed.
1,horrible reception,"Bought for a rural house in NH, but we could not find an antenna configuration that gave a continuous signal-- we got continual ""hiccups"" in the music. We thought the cause might be location, and took it to a Boston area house, with no greater success.Pros: OK sound quality when there was a signalCons: None of the included antennas were able to give acceptable signal reception"
4,xm boom box,"good sound quality and well built boom box for xm portability. I little larger than I thought it would be, but otherwise good. Jack for external antenna is a nice feature as well"
5,Great Boombox!!!!,This is actually the 2nd Belkin boombox I have purchased. I now have one at home and at the office. The sound is incredible and has great bass.
4,Great way to enjoy XM,"Pros: Easy setup, good reception (at least in San Francisco), very portable, nice little remote.Cons: Color and styling are sort of ugly, sound quality is good but not great, would have loved a rechargable battery instead of using 8 C cells when it's not plugged into an outlet.Overall, I'm quite satisfied. I'm using it with the XM Roady XT, and it's nice to have the option of hooking that unit up to the car or home stereo, too. I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to listen to XM and wants the option of portability."
1,ruins the Roady,"I bought this thinking that I could use my XM radio in the car and outside the car, which worked great for the first month. However, what they do not tell you is that the cradle in the Belkin is not the right size and eventually ruins the connectors in the Roady to the extent that it no longer works. I wish I had known this before, as I had to have my Roady replaced. Belkin knows about the problem, as they provided me with an adaptor so the Roady would work in the Belkin portable, but that did no good for using it in the car. Delphi was great, as they replaced my Roady XT free of charge and said that they have had to do this numerous times for the same reason, and were recommending that no one use the Belkin. Now, I can no longer use the Belkin, and Belkin will not refund the money. Buyer Beware!!!"
1,Item stopped working two weeks after receiving.,"I have subscribe to XM for at least 15 years and enjoy it, but you don't want to have a problem of any kind, then it's a very different story. It took me a year and hours of phone time for them to return my money when they over charge me. Now they have charged me $199 dollars for an item that was clearly marked $99 which I accepted,, but the item stopped working two weeks after giving it as a Christmas gift and they refuse to do anything about it."
3,Belkin F5X007 XM Audio System,"when i order it i thought it would have all the small parts with it ( power cord, remote etc.) so when i got it nothing was with it just the boom box only, so it was shipped back to the seller for credit, if i had known it came that way i would have not order it."
2,only lasted 1 year,I was very careful with this and after only 1 year one of the speakers stoped working.I suggest other models.
4,Love it.... I think,"Have used this radio indoors on various job sites for about a year. Very happy with XM service (though customer service is subpar) and this boombox in particular. Have had no problems and was impressed with unit's construction, durability, ease of use, and sound.However... My boombox just quit working 2 weeks ago. It still provides power to my Roady XT receiver in its cradle, but no sound through the speakers. It's possible a power spike killed it, so I won't give a negative review unless I hear of others with similar problems.I've already had my receiver replaced once (warranty replacement thru Delphi was very quick and easy!) and stolen once in the space of a year. A few bumps in the road, but commercial-free radio rocks!"
3,Bad Remote / Bad Replacement,"The radio itself is perfect, however I have gone through two remote controls and several batteries and a couple of hours with customer service with Belkin & Amazon and nobody has a replacement unit (all out of stock)and was informed this radio may not be manufactured anymore. Too much of a headache to deal with anymore..."
1,Not worth it.,"Note that this boombox has only one function, to play XM radio. There is no cassette or CD player. If you can't get a good satellite signal, there is no regular radio either. And getting a good satellite signal indoors can be difficult. It comes with a long optional antenna wire that you can substitute for the built in stub antenna. I had to string it across the room to a west window to get a signal. It was a gift that I was thrilled to return."
1,Buyer Beware!!!,"It barely lasted 6 months - it didn't harm my Roady, but it the speakers quit working. We paid about $120 for it and of course it's out of warranty."
3,good!!,"Forget about everything Seagal has done since Exit Wounds & Half Past Dead and pretend this is his next release. This movie has a plot and held my attention the whole movie and Seagal returns to his bone crunching old self as this film has the most fight scenes and action since The glimmer man. Not his best movie but better than Half Past Dead and about the same as Exit Wounds. This one could have been sent to box office but with Seagal the only starpower they sent it to DVD, but it looks big budget."
4,Getting back in form,"This is a good one. Seagal's last few movies have been somewhat hit or miss, but this one is a hit. Not a lot of hand-to-hand stuff like his early movies, after all he is getting on in years. But lots of action and a minimum of the psychic, mystical stuff that sometimes bogs down his films. This one had much better production values then some of his recent movies as well; no dubbing his voice and some cash was spent on blowing things up. Lots of cars, a helicopter, even an entire building. No special features on this disk though.Steven gets set up and someone has to pay. Actually a lot of someones. If you are a Seagal fan you'll like this one, hopefully his upcoming movies can match it.Enjoy!"
1,Bad Movie,"Do not, do not purchase this movie. I just finished seeing it for the first time recently, and I can say hands down that this was far and away the worst movie that Steven Seagal has ever made. Although I am not a prude, the language was disgusting with Mother F***** this and Mother F****** that every 10 seconds. The plot went nowhere and it was filled with unnecessary violence. Most of his old movies went somewhere, but this one was one violence, bad language filled scene after scene after scene. If you liked the old Steven Seagal movies, you won't like this one."
3,"It's a Seagal movie, enough said.","My wife LOVES Seagal so this was added to her collection. Not his best by a long shot, but it is a Seagal movie."
1,not that into it,"The only reason I have this movie is because my husband likes it. He is a fan of Steven Seagal. I tried to watch it last night, but I lost all interest. I think this movie is boring."
2,Today is time for a change,"I did not like today you die very much. The script just did not seem like a good fit for Seagal. I think some of the scenes were taken from other movies which was a turn off for me as well. Probably only for the serious Seagal fan, otherwise look towards say ""the keeper' or 'belly of the beast for a better picture.Peter J. Miller"
3,"Yes, I agree with most of these less-than-impressed reviews","There were way too many inconsistencies that make you question why certain things are put in the film that don't mean anything, and yet there are things that must be missing because it didn't make any sense.I gotta say though, I believe it's time for Steven Seagal to retire. Either that, or get some exercise and eat right to slim down a bit. Maybe then, he can get about another five years of action film appeal. This ""The Biggest Loser"" candidate needs to improve his health before he worries about making a movie that may put a little extra ""fast food funding"" in his pocket.This is one of many Steven Seagal films that seem to just go right to video instead of being a theatrical release, and this is rightly so. I suppose someday, they will release a special Steven Seagal: 10 movie: direct to video: box set, and they could only hope that it might sell for maybe ten dollars."
3,More Seagal violence and revenge,"Seagulls are white crows...Trying to use a spiritualistic justification forextremes of violence, this movie moves from one scene of death to another.The robinhood theme just doesn't work when the money is drug money to start with? From prison breaks to killing the big guys behind the scenes,this movies seems to be about revenge more than any sort of good doing?I wish I could say the plot or the acting were good:I think only the martial arts had any quality."
2,Warning: Disc 2 is NOT the Clancy Brothers,"Disc 2 is nearly all solos by David Hammond, with a few duets with an unidentified woman. Disc 1 is the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem, but all these songs are on Sony discs."
1,UNDER-WHELMING,"definitely not #2 live dinner. no cool stories, nothing different than listening to the album version with some people yelling in between songs. a couple of cool solos by rich brotherton & marty muse, but other than that, save your money. i am a very long time fan and hate to have to write a poor review."
5,Great book!,I loved this book. It's not difficult to understand and it really brought the scriptures alive for me. It also brings the scriptures into context with what else was going on at the time. I now understand some verses that previously did not make sense to me. I highly recommend this book.
5,An absolute must read. It will open the door of Truth.,"Quite simply, the best and most important book I have ever read. It will provide the reader with the understanding of Christ's life, death, and resurrection. It will provide the reader with the light of knowledge and wisdom. It will provide solace to the reader seeking the Truth in the world today. Fulton Sheen must be heralded as one of the world's great modern theologians."
5,Life of Christ by fulton J Sheen,"A great read for those who would like to understand deeper the Life of christ as written in the Bible. Wonderful insights by this saintly Man of God,Bishop Sheen."
4,Learning About Our Lord in a New Way,I was helped by Apb. Sheen's explication of Gospel passages and got a clearer sense of Who Christ Is by reading this book. It deserves re-reading throughout the year.
5,Great shoes for my toddler,"I bought these shoes for my 20 month old. She loves them! She especially likes the fact that she can put them on and taken them off herself since they are velcro. I like the fact that they are genuine leather and not cheap plastic. The sparkly sequins sewn on the top are a very nice touch also. I couldn't see the detail in the photo, but the pink design is kind of sparkly. Very cute shoes!"
4,good fit,Once again Stride Rite has the best fit for our little one's wide feet. Would definitely recommend this cute pair of sandals.
5,Durable and comfortable,"Durable and comfortable sandal. With Stride Rite we never prove wrong. Cute, durable, comfortable. Simple though nice pattern. Holds the leg very well."
4,Very enjoyable,I have so far enjoyed this game. It has everything I like and nothing that I don't like. The graphics are good. The game is easy to learn but hard to master. The AI makes smart decisions when trying to attack and defend.Unfortunately the game is a little buggy. In one instance I took over all of Japan but one province and everytime I got to the end of the battle for that province the game would close and go to the desktop. Very annoying....Definately worth buying anyway....Scott
4,Great Game,"Shogun is a nice game with great scenary, but it's camera movement is terrible (you can make it move or look). I always find myself looking at the units at eye level. The unit controls are good, complete with formations and marching speed. Overall this is a great game, but the camera controls can make and break a game, and I feel that it really hurt this one."
1,Shame of a game,"Shogun looks stunning. But it has a user interface from hell. As you are struggling with camera viewpoints and group commands and battle formations the AI is charging you. Obviously the AI has not to struggle as much as you do. The battle tactics of the AI are very good, so you are slashed and diced into sushi before you know it. The soldiers are blurry and all have the same color. The devolpers should have looked at the classic Total Annihilation before they made Total War. One star for the AI and battle ground graphics."
5,Great game,"This game is fantastic. I normally never played computer games before until one of my best friends showed me this game. At first I found it boring yet interesting. But later I started getting really into it, to the point that I HAD to buy it. Now I have been playing the game for months, and the game has great grafics and wonderful battle scenes. The multiplayer format is good but it needs a little work. Now, even my brother wants to play it like I do, and we get in fights over who's allowd to play next. It's a fantastic game and if you haven't bought it yet, you really need to."
1,Bad lesson for kids,Animals use violence to force a farmer out of his house and run him off his own land. There is a good reason why this is on the list of recommend children's reading at the website for the US Socialist party. Violence toward land owners is no lesson for kids to learn. Very disappointing.
1,"This book is scary - it is an Animal Farm rewrite, pro-communist.","The plot of the story is this:Lazy farmer works duck hard, gets all rewards (he's the capitalist boss)Duck goes ""Quack"" for about 3/5 of the book as its dialogue. Real brilliant there.Animals overthrow the greedy farmer.Farm turns into a cooperative owned by all animals = happy ending.This is a propaganda book, with a plot similar to a rewrite of animal farm - but without the negative ending. As I was reading it, it gradually dawned on me what I checked out from the library. I got the chinese/english version - which is at least useful to me for learning some basic chinese."
5,Great book for reading readiness...,This book lets you teach 44 vowel-spellings with 213 vocabulary words.
3,nose hair scissors,I was searching for a replacement for my Revlon nose hair scissors which was no longer sharp. The Tweezerman scissors had good reviews. I am only moderately satisfied with it as it does not seem as sharp as the original Revlon was when new.
3,Hit or miss,"I had a pair of these which I used for a year which worked great. Over that time, though, the blade dulled, which was to be expected and I'd opened a few things with them which led to some more damage. Also the hinge rusted up from from moisture. Despite that, I'd liked how they cut so much I got a second pair. This pair may be defective, because it's loose at the hinge (which cannot be tightened) and the blades are fairly dull. Consequently, trying to trim facial hair with these has resulted in painfully plucking out hairs and uneven results. I don't want to gamble that a 3rd pair would work well, so I think I'm going have to find some new scissors."
4,The Hipster Spies With His Little Eye Something That Begins With--Useful & handy.,"Nose & ear hair is a pain to clip, & ordinary scissors are often painful.These are perfect for the task.Simple & easy to use.The tips are carefully rounded, to avoid pinching or wounding."
3,These are Okay,"I would call these scissors ""okay."" They are reasonably sharp and do a good job of trimming nose hairs...when you can coax them into the position where they need to be. That's the tricky part. The bulbous head on the scissors is a little bigger than the photo would seem to imply, which means that maneuvering it inside a human nose to where it needs to be to effectively cut hair can be a challenge. While I can certainly understand the scissors not having a sharp, pointed tip, ideally the head should be a little more narrow."
3,An OK pair of scissors,"These scissors are sturdy. The blunted ends are a plus. But for me, the blade length is too short. As a result, I seldom actually use these -- most of the time I select another pair from my cabinet."
4,"Sharp, compact, easy to use, not perfect for beards","I bought these scissors for two main reasons. One of the reasons was that they are compact and easy to keep with my electric shaver when grooming to help even out the facial hair. The other reason was the rounded tips to utilize for spots that I'd otherwise nick myself.These scissors are fantastic for getting facial hair cleanly cut when its in small amounts. These scissors are absolutely tiny! As a result, you can't really cut much hair at once, so these scissors are only best for mustaches, eyebrows, nose, and ears. For beards, I suggest you use an electric, $20 razor kit with changing heads that lets you groom much more evenly across your facial hair. This thing just isn't big enough to do the job. It's nonetheless a great buy for convenience if you like to groom very carefully and personally, and the rounded tips ensure no nicks!"
2,stainless steel model blades too thick and bulky,"Like the rubis, you can't really get close and thus not effectivethere are other tweezerman ones that are thinner, and work well, buying a 2nd pair of the others"
5,The Perfect scissors,We purchased three pair of safety scissors to help keep our teacup poodle hair around her eyes trimmed. The Tweezerman pair cut very good and are safe for their use. The extra pairs are for our senior minds when we cannot remember where we put those scissors. Thank you for your service and for good products. Larry.
4,Sharp!,"I can finally trim my unsightly ear hair without worrying about stabbing myself with the pointy manicure scissors I was using. These are very sharp and excellent quality. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is they are slightly larger than I expected, making them a little more difficult to use in my nostrils than would be true if they were a little smaller."
1,You want how much??????????,"I too saw this movie years, years ago. Loved it however, they're asking waaaaay too much. Too bad. No sale here. I gave it one star for the price. I give it 5 stars for the movie."
4,Good Intro Text To Missions,"This will provide an adequate base for further thought and search of the Scriptures on the topic of missions.The author is experienced not only in teaching and writing about the topic, but was himself a missionary for fourteen years.He covers the topic well, spicing the discussion with examples which will help the newcomer to the field relate much quicker with his points.It suffers from a poor view of the means of grace, not clearly sensing and expressing that the Gospel purely preached and the Sacraments administered according to the Lord's mandate are the power of God to spread His kingdom. Thus, he at times relies more on communication models and cross-cultural contextualism than he should.With making these necessary and vital theological corrections as one reads (i.e. reading with discernment) this text serves a valuable introductory aid."
5,very soft,Love this wrap thing. It is so versatile because it can be a shawl typoe thing or a scarf. It is a beautiful color and super soft. Love it.
2,Nice color VERY thin,"I have several cashmere wraps they are all thicker and warm. I knew this was going to be thinner the cost told me that but I can see through the single thread weave. It is usable as a scarf where it is bunched up, but don't think you can use it as a wrap."
2,So thin!,I don't what is pashmina but I am sure it is not cashmere. The product's quality is no good. It looks cheap!
3,Some good moments and some not so good ones as well,"I originally bought this album after having enjoyed Handy's playing on the Kansas City Soundtrack. Handy plays very well throughout the album, but falls prey to some gimmicks which rubbed me the wrong way. Two tracks have spoken word poetry, which I am not enthralled by, and at least one other uses synthesized strings (rather repulsive in my opinion). Handy gets some great support from pianist Geri Allen, and overall the band is quite good. Check out ""Eclipse"" which is an excellent track."
1,not recommended,"Buying this camera I learned that ISO 3600 is more a con than a pro. Any picture with ISO superior than 400 or 800 is way too grainy. Also Super steady shot is just not enough, pictures with low light (not dark) do still look shaky. Sony should try harder.One more thing, the edition effects that the cammera offers (i.e. colorizing) are much worst than in other brands (like cannon)."
4,Sony Cybershot DSCW90 8.1MP Not for beginners.,"This is my first digital camera. I should have bought a simpler one to start with. It has many good features but I have not figured out how to use them so I put the camera on automatic. If you know what you are doing it's great, but otherwise start with one that is truly ""point and shoot."" Also, everything is very tiny and I need a magnifier to read the screen.Angela McEwan"
2,"Bought as point-and-shoot, not that simple, blurry and grainy in all but perfect conditions","Bought it as a point-and-shoot camera, but without significant adjustments, it was very blurry and grainy. It still takes terrible photos at night or with any of the settings but ISO. Bought it to replace an old basic point-and-shoot, but the old one is better all around. In fact, if we hadn't brought the other camera with us too on our last trip, nothing but daytime pictures would have been worth keeping at all!"
3,Esperaba una mejor cámara,"(spanish) Al parecer no soy el único con un problema parecido, pero la verdad esperaba una super cámara, y aún no estoy seguro si mi camara tenia algun tipo de problema o todas son asi. El punto es que al comparar las fotos con otra cyber shot que tenia anteriormente de 6MP pues la de 6 saca mejores fotos que esta de 8MP, y la mayoria de fotos no son claras sino tienen muchos granos, yo esperaba que una camara de 8MP sacara fotos muy grandes y muy claras y no fue así, si la quieren para fotos pequeñas perfecto pero las grandes o el tamaño real se ven mal, muchos granos."
5,LOVE IT,I love this Camera the only thing I wish was better is the zoom other than that I have taken pictures at dawn & dusk and the pics are great.
3,the only problem is blurriness,This camera so far is the nicest oneBut like all other the blurriness is an issueAnd also slowBut it's very colorful and when the camera decided it takes nice great sharp pictures but not much only when the camera wants to.
4,"Sony, never perfect, but works well.","I dont know what the deal is with Sony these days. Quick summary the new W line offers some improved performance, lighter pictures (better flash performance) compared to the previous darker cybershots cameras. However in this new W line. The menu system is NOT simple but more complex and in addition Sony removed the battery time remaing!!! Pffft, that does the user alot of good. Again Sony's greed shows prompting the user to get a faster charger and buying an additional battery becuase the user can not rely and guess the time remaining. I will give this camera a try if picture quality is anything like the negative reviews I will return and settle with the tried and proven W55. If this does pan out, it could rilval my F828."
4,I LOVE THIS CAMERA!,"I was looking for days for a camera that was easy to use, compact, and also with a decent price. I LOVE IT!! This fits all those categories. It takes beautiful pictures all the time, and the pictures are so clear! I have to be honest and say I was very nervous until this camera arrived at my home. Even with all the reviews I thought, ""You don't really know what something is like until you get it."" On top of that I bought a used one that said to be in ""like new"" condition. Let me tell you.....my camera came perfect. I love this camera so much and would tell anyone to get it! The only thing I wasn't use to was the camera came with a battery that you have to charge instead of using AA or AAA batteries. If charging a battery isnt a problem for you then get this item!! The battery last a good while unlike some batteries can so....I guess it has to be your personal preference, but I LOVE THIS!!!!!"
1,Broke within the first 6 months and they won't replace it,"I really liked this camera, but considering that it broke within the first six months, without being dropped and with no physical damage whatsoever. Furthermore, my experience got worse as SONY has refused to fix it or replace saying there's corrosion but not explaining what the damage was from or where in the camera it was found. The worst product and company I have ever had to deal with!!!"
5,"Great, camera exellent photos for a Point and Shoot","I have to say, that it has been 4 years, and this Camera is still going strong. I have taken over 50,000 pictures and I have to say this camera is just very reliable. I even purchased the diving case for it....unfortunally I only used it 2 times.... Well besides that yes the camera has been to all my world travels and has taken pictures of all types of ocassions. It is a really good camera the day pictures aver vivid and the HIGH ISO night shot is nice at capturing low light, (Don't Expect DSLR) over all this has been one of the longest lasting Sony products. I know at some point it will stop working and is almost irrelevant to review a item that is 4 years old but yeah I thank you Sony Engineers for creating this camera it has been without any faults or glitches since Feb, 2007. I just hope the next replacement is just as good. ......."
2,good for casual pics,"We had bought this camera for our first Disney family trip and loved it, but some pics came out grainy in low light. Overall good digital pics to share onlinebut if you need really clear printed pics maybe look elsewhere."
2,blew up after 9 months,"read enough positive reviews that I switched from canon powershot. not happy with it. took decent enough pictures but still liked canon better. then, after 9 months, it just would not open. as long as sony fixes it without cost, my review might improve, but i have my doubts."
3,Not bad for a first outing,"The best thing about this book and the subsequent books is that the thoughts and atittudes of the Lewrie character are probably more accurate (ranging from panic to misery to disbelief most of the time) than most of the others in the genre. The pornographic elements telegraph themselves and can be ignored since they have nearly nothing to do with either the story or the character. Great history, though. Roman a Clef like the others, but well rendered."
1,Trashy and poorly written,"Having fallen in love with Patrick O'Brian's work, I started branching out into other naval fiction set in the same era. C. S. Forester and Frederick Marryat are very enjoyable. Lambdin is abysmal. The King's Coat is very poorly written and edited - subjects and verbs don't agree, there are endless misspellings, and any time he's at a loss, Lambdin throws in sex. The sex is fairly explicit, which is OK, but serves no other purpose than titillation of the reader, which is not. It advances the story in no way at all. Lewrie is apparently intended to be a nautical Flashman, but Lambdin doesn't have anything approaching the skill of George Macdonald Fraser. When Lambdin runs out of inspiration, Lewrie tumbles a wench at length and in great detail. The dialogue tends to sound either suspiciously American and modern, or archly dated. Nothing to recommend this book or the series except the fairly well done descriptions of the handling of the ships."
1,Disappointing,"I read this novel with the expectation of something similar for the C.S. Forester Novels of Hornblower. Boy, was I disappointed. It really is just an opera set to the background of the mid 1700's British Naval Era. It contains very little in the way of excitement that is worth anything. The writing is not moving and the explicit sexual scenes were over the top. I also take exception to the anti-gay sentiments revealed throughout the book. The writer reveals his true chauvinistic and homo-phobic tendencies with ungentleman like descriptions of women and gays. Reading pornography when I am looking for classic writing about a bygone era is like going to a boxing match and a hockey game breaks out, completely unnecessary. Sorry Dewey, but this one fell far short. I could not even complete the novel it was so bad."
4,Damn Fine Georgian-Era Sea Stories!,"I read this book, the first in the series, and didn't find it greatly attractive. But it was good enough to make me read the *second* book in the series, and, from there on in, they just keep getting better. This is, in my opinion, the weakest book in the entire series. So...bear up, give it a chance, and keep going. You may find your persistence rewarded.The research is excellent. The nautical details are first rate.The sex scenes are unnecessarily lurid. I could really do without all the sex and cussing.But...these are sailors!"
3,Good story with some interesting characters,"The King's Coat is a good story, maybe better than the 3 stars I rated it, of course I am a fan of nautical fiction with a soft spot for a leading character with a tarnished reputation. It's easy for Hornblower & Bolitho to come out on top in almost every situation because they have no chinks in their armour. Not true with Alan Lewrie. He has some gaps in his character you could sail a ship of the line through! I guess that's what makes this unlikely hero so loveable. The naval detail is good and the characterization is better. The plot was a little thin, more like part I in a larger volume. Sure hope the publishers can find a way to reprint the next book in the series."
2,Sloppy writing and editing. Readable stories.,"This guy is not even close to being in a league with O'Brian. His characters are inconsistent and obvious, thin cliches. He makes his hero smart about whatever he has to be smart about at the time, with no relation to his education or background. The writing is sloppy. Every time a leadsman calls the depth, he ""mournfully intones."" The sex is overdone and over written. The author's basic attitude is adolescent. The ship handling and battle scenes are good enough to make the books worth a casual read. I'd call him 3rd rate, but that would mean he had 50 guns."
5,Alan Lewrie Naval Adventures,"This is the first in a series of 20 books on the adventures of Alan Lewrie in the Royal Navy in the day of sail. I have read ten of the books and am looking forward to the rest. My brother and I cooperate in our reading habits. I get the books first, read them and then send them on to him.. After reading, he donates them to the local small Texas town library where he lives. We have done this for several years and all benefit. He did tell me however that all the books in this series are ""keepers"" to be reread in a couple of years. The main character (Alan Lewrie) and his adventures and progression in rank over time is similar to Bernard Cornwell's Richard Sharpe 21 book series except that Lewrie's adventrues all take place in a Royal Navy environment whereas Sharpes are in the British Army. The time period is similar an both series are outstanding ""keepers"". Read ""The Kings Coat"" and you will have to read them all (if you can find them)."
4,The King's Coat,This is the first book in the series and is well enough written to entice you to read the others
3,A good book if not just a little trashy.,"I really did enjoy this book. more than the amount of stars that i gave it. the character is alan lewrie. a rogue and unlikly hero, he is thrown into his majesty's service by circumstance and tries to make the best of it. the action is fast paced and exciting. it does get graphic at times with the effects of splinters and cannon balls. i enjoy how the hero is not all prim and proper made a good refreshing change from hornblower. my only real complaint is the sex. it is heavy and very un-necessary to the overall story. just thrown in to fill some pages. but apart from that the story is interesting and worth a read. but keep in mind that this book is not for everyone and if you are thinking of buying it for your kids then i strongly recommend looking at the hornblower series. otherwise pick it up and give it a read."
5,Lewd.. Licivious.. Landlubbing?? Lewrie!,"I must admit, this is the first book of this kind that I've read and I found it to be a great book. Although getting through all the sailors slang was a little confusing, this was still a quick and enjoyable read.Lambdin did a fine job in his freshman attempt at authoring a naval novel. He's created a likeable lead man and has a well developed supporting cast. The battle scenes are great and the sex was just raw enough to be entertaining.I highly recommend this novel!"
4,Very good,"I liked this book, very good on naval tactics and facts. Would recommend it to anyone interested the British Navy of the time."
4,Good light reading,"Good light reading. The antithesis to the Hornblower character. Entertaining, and fun to read, probably accurate in terms of 18th century seamanship."
5,Great book,Lord every word of Alan lewrie's action packed nautical adventures. I can't wait to read the second book in this series
4,Good short stories.,The Cricket on the Hearth: and Other Christmas Stories. Good short stories. Gave book & brass fireplace cricket as a gift.
4,Good Holiday Fare,"While you may be tempted to say, ""It's no 'A Christmas Carol' "", it is an injustice to do so. What is,other than that venerable text? This story must be judged by its own merits, and it stands well on them. Lively characters, turns of plot and Dickensian dialogue pepper the page. If you like Dickens, you will enjoy this tale."
3,Some Good Some Bad,"The Cricket on the Hearth was a great story. It kept my interest and was an effective short story. The Holly-Tree was good in the sense that it provided a really good picture of British inns and ""Dickens"" England. The Haunted House was quite boring. I gave it many chances thinking that it would improve but it only got worse. If it wasn't for the third story, I would have given the book a 4 star rating but it's worth buying for the first two. And reading it around Christmas time is a good idea."
5,Splendid New Year's Concert from VPO and Maazel,"This year's concert was devoted almost exclusively to music by Johann Strauss II. Without question, it is among the Vienna Philharmonic's best New Year's Concerts, led by a long-time collaborator at the podium, American conductor Lorin Maazel, who has conducted the orchestra since the early 1960s. The orchestra responded enthusiastically to him, following his tempi even when he wasn't conducting (In two works he plays violin solos, most notably the ""Tales from the Vienna Woods"" waltz.). On a somber note, the traditional final piece of the concert, Johann Strauss' Radetzky March was not played, a silent tribute offered to the victims of the December 26th earthquake and tsunami in the Indian Ocean (However, the other traditional encore, the ""Blue Danube"" waltz was played.). Fans of both the Vienna Philharmonic and Lorin Maazel will be interested in acquiring this DVD."
1,Don't waste your money,"Maazel is one of those conductors who can be called perfect professionals. Brilliant mind, brilliant ears, but the music simply dies in his hands. I saw him twice in performance. The man is dreadfully bored and...boring. Watch Kleiber and then compare. If you want to get a great New year concert, get Kleiber and get Pretre. Perhaps Muti. Everything else is entertaining, but not special at all."
5,A true writetologist,"This offering that Ms. Bryant brings forth is another winner. ""Let DO IT Again"" let's those that are new to Ms. Bryant's writings know that she delivers the goods. I have read all of this writers books and I never once been disappointed with her books. I love this book just as much as I love Heavenly Match which is also by Ms. Bryant. This new book it the type of book that you do not lend out. It is the type of book that makes you tell them that they have to get there own copy. Yes Malcolm and Serena's story is that great."
5,Great book,I like this one it shows that with love you can overcome anything. And this two people had a lot of unresolved issues between them but they still loved each other and in the end it's love all that matters.
5,LET'S DO IT AGAIN & AGAIN,"FIRST OF ALL I HAVE YET TO READ A BOOK, BY NIOBIA THAT WAS BAD. THIS BOOK WAS THE BOMB, I MEAN IT SHOWED HOW LOVE IS BETTER THE SECOND TIME AROUND, AND HATERS ARE USUALLY CLOSER THEN YOU THINK, NOT ONLY WAS MALCOLM THE BOMB, BUT SEXY AS HELL! HE WAS NOT ONLY AS A BEST FRIEND BUT THEY FACT HE REALLY GREW UP TO BE A MAN. SERENA WAS JUST OFF THE HOOK THIS IS THE TYPE OF FEMALE YOU WANT TO HANG WITH. SERENA WAS STILL IN LOVE WITH MALCOLM BUT HE DID SOMETHING THAT HURT HER TO THE CORE, SO ALTHOUGH SHE KNEW SHE WAS IN LUST, SHE WASN'T WILLING TO ADMIT THE LOVE PART. BOTH OF THEM HAD GROWN UP TO NOT ONLY REACH THEIR OWN PERSONAL GOALS BUT SOMETHING WAS STILL MISSING. L-O-V-E.ALSO THE LOVE BOTH OF THEM HAD FOR HIS GRANDMOTHER TOUCHED MY HEART. THIS IS A BOOK WORTH BUYING AND READING AGAIN"
2,Not this time...,"I loved all of N. Bryant's other work but unlike everyone else this one didn't do it for me.I found the heroine selfish and immature, from the beginning to the end. Making me wonder why Malcolm would hang in there to have her.There are some laugh out loud moments & the verbiage is as fun as it is in her other books, but this particular one I can't recommend."
3,Sturdy?!?,"Sturdy? These are the flimsiest toys I've ever seen. My son broke the tailpipe off the Boost car in minutes, and he wasn't even being that rough with it."
4,Boost & Snot Rod are a hit for my toodler!,"Great toys, very durable. Lots of fun - my son loves them!"
4,Fit Perfectly,I would have given it a five except it didnt come with instructions but it was simple enought to replace. The order came in a timely fashion I appreciate the delivery time. I will probably ordering another lamp in the future. Great Price!
1,One star because I couldn't give it zero,"I had to send this back to Amazon since this replacement did not fit my Epson model, which is specifically says it does. There is a small piece of plastic surrounding one of the connectors that is made slightly different than the original lamp and it doesn't allow the lamp to fit flush and make a connection.My projector is now useless without the replacement lamp. Amazon offered to replace it, but with what? That was the official replacement. A real shame since I was fairly happy with the projector itself. Lesson learned, no more Epson products for me."
3,Book 4 in the Three Musketeers series,"A fairly good book. However, very little is seen of D'Artagnan and his friends. This particular book focuses more on the court intrigues of Louis XIV. If you are a great fan of the series (six books in all), you should add this book to your collection. If you are a casual reader, you might not be as interested."
1,"Good music, miserable CD",I love this music and was looking forward to owning my own copy. It was a real shock to hear the poor quality of the recording and mixing on the album. I can't wait to get rid of my copy.
1,"without exaggerations,I'm the most one who love Cheb Khaled","Hello...I advice everyone to hear the Rai music because it's the best,and I'm sure that the all will love this kind of music.About me I can't go to my University before listening to this music and also I can't sleep without hearing it.Enjoy this music and especially cheb khaled..."
3,2/3 good - what happened to Larry?,"It is good to see these guys back together. Not being a fan of Ron White, I didn't miss him. Jeff and Bill are absolutely great. However, what happened to Larry? He has gotten a lot cruder (similar to Ron White). His jokes were not that funny, and the crowd doesn't laugh nearly as much. I am undecided if I want to buy the DVD for just Bill and Jeff."
3,What happened to Bill Engvall?,"I thought this was so-so, but I was really disappointed by Bill. He is usually my fave of all of them, but he just seemed so uppity. Seriously making fun of minimum wage workers? Not funny. Jeff was great as usual and it is hard for me to watch Larry without thinking he really doesn't talk like that so I am always trying to catch him slipping. It was ok, but not as good as the last one."
3,them idiots,"I was somewhat disappointed with Larry the Cable Guy's performance in this show. Other works of his have been better, particularly his ""Only in America"" series on the History channel."
2,It's not like blue collar comedy tour,"sorry,, but it's not even close to the status of the blue collar tour videos.. that one dude,,Bill engval ,, isn't even funny,,he really sucks.. Larry and Jeff where ok...."
5,Whirled Tour,These guys are the funniest. They do some of the stupidest things but they are hilarious no less. You watch this and you will be laughing for hours!
4,Love the Blue Collar crew!,About what you would expect from this bunch of nuts :) Another solid performance but probably on the lower end as far as their other DVDs. Audio and video is both good.
3,Thought it would be better,"We thought this would be better but it was kind of lame. It's still funny though, but not as good as the originals"
4,Like Blue Collar DVD's better,"I was hoping for the same level of comedy as the previous Blue Collar DVD's. I was a little disappointed. Not a fan of Larry the Cable Guy, wish they would have had Ron White instead. It seemed like most of their jokes consisted of turning 50. Still enjoyed Bill Engval and Jeff Foxworthy, just didn't laugh nearly as much."
3,No Ron White!!,Without Ron White it just not the same. He really did not fit in with the others type of comedy and the fans they attracted. Dont get me wrong i really liked their Red Neck Comedy shows (all 3 of them). But its time to move on like Ron did.
2,Xtrememac TuffWrap Nano,"This is NOT for the Nano 5th g. It gives very sketchy information, and I think they might actually have changed the description, because when I bought it I thought it was for the 5th g. I have no idea what version it does fit, but not 5th g.It may or may not work well, but why would you buy it unless you knew for sure what it was supposed to fit?"
4,Just plain fun....,"Time and time again, the Command & Conquer series keeps getting better and better. And Firestorm does not disappoint. The only slightly disappointing thing was the units which I didn't think were that great (you hardly ever got to use them except for the Juggernaut and it's aim was poor). The missions and the story were both very good, especially the last mission for GDI. It was very tough to get started with missile launches and units continually attacking you, and once you met the objective, the towering (and I do mean towering) robot you had to fight was super cool. And you weren't done with that mission even after you destroyed the robot. If you have Tiberian Sun, Get this expansion pack, you will not be disappointed."
3,Only good in multiplayer mode,"I finished Firestorm in 2 days. Its mission are real easy. So if you are buying it only for the game against the computer it aint worth its money. But if you enjoy the multiplayer mode, its worth buying. I played Tiberian Sun only in ther Internet and its fun. And with all the units from Firestorm it is much more fun. Especially the Mobile War Factory and the Jiggernouts kicks ass. Sorry for my bad English - its because Im from Germany. Conclusion: If u want to play the game in the net or network - BUY IT! If u just want to play against the computer - it aint worth the money you pay for it."
3,Not Quite Up To Par,"I was somewhat dissapointed in the fact that C&C 2 did not add to the RTS genre, even though it is my favorite game. However, much like Red Alert's expansion packs, this one adds too many units that are one man armies that can level you or your opponent VERY quickly. This ruined the playbalance. It makes for a blast in multiplayer though, because you get armies of the big dudes... The single player expansion leaves lots to be desired."
1,Cr***y,I was Highly disappointed in this game.. I was expecting a challanging C&C game but instead all I got was an easy game with units that look like cartoons on a beautiful background.. DON'T BUY IT!
4,It's an Improvment,"When I bought Firestorm I was expecting a normal expansion pack - few new units, maps etc. But once I started playing I realized that there was much more to it than that.The biggest improvment over Tiberian Sun is story. The story is much more interesting and although the in game movies suck it dosen't matter because most of the plot twists are in-game anyways. Special units have been created just for one part in the story, such as a huge robot, which is a nice touch.Although the music is being sold as faster paced and more like Red Alert it's pretty much more of the same. Graphics also don't change too much.The new units are pretty cool but the Reaper is the only one that I really liked, unfortunatly you can only use it in Multiplayer. The new Juggernaut artilery unit is alright but it can't really aim that well and the Nod Art. unit is still superior in my mind.All in all Firestorm makes Tiberian Sun a much better game and if you already have TS then by all means buy Firestorm."
2,One for all,I bought this CD for You're a Lady-a wonderful song that always pleased and haunted me. The other tracks were diluted sentimental or cmmercial for my taste although in an off-beat cabaret way they might appeal.
2,A Tiny Bit Disappointing,"Supposedly about the scientific intelligence teams that wandered through post-war (just) Germany trying to locate the Reich's scientific secrets...When I first ordered this book, I assumed that it would be an exciting blend of adventure and science. Ah, no. Rather, the writer spends an inordinate amount of time telling us about himself, Atomic Theory, pre-war Germany, his role in winning the war and so on. As it turns out, he's had a fairly interesting life, so the book isn't a total bust, but I would have liked to have learned more about the grunts in the field and the risks they took."
1,You're joking...right,"This game was so unbelievably bad, I don't know where to start. The graphics were pretty good but the missions were just horrible. If you're thinking about buying this game, think again. It isn't even worth renting."
2,Disappointment,"Short and to the point this game was a let down. Control on this game was good. AI of the enemies and your squadmates in the game for the most part is PATHETIC!! Several times your squadmates and enemy will be standing a couple of feet apart and nothing happens... they just shoot at each other. Only positive is enemy AI does improve a little in the last stages of the game. Another bad point is the load time between missions/levels. It was so nice for the programmers to think we need a POTTY BREAK upon completion of each mission. Only good thing about this game is the surround sound!! Playing on a 5.1 surround system, you'll swear the enemy is setting up an ambush behind your easy chair. Note: I had to return my copy of this game due to sound cutting in/out. Salesperson advised they had received several exchanges due to sound cutting in/out. Overall I would have to say the only thing big about this game was the HYPE!! Rent this first!!"
4,For All Style Gamers,"This game is Ghost Recon,Conflict Desert Storm,and Syphon Filter put together.In case you haven't played any of those games there pretty good. Especially put together. It's got aweseome graphics and that machine is really kick butt.This game is definatly worth playing.Except the terrorist are to easy to kill unless there's alot of thim. Have fun."
3,"Its okay,but not worth buying","When I first played this game, I enjoyed it for about a month.But after awhile,I really got bored of it.I mean,going around in dull environments and blasting stupid A.I. Not only that,but the graphics look like crap! If you want a better squad-based game,play Freedom Fighters."
1,not very good,"They may have spent alot of their budget on sound but soundtrack itself right out of a bad hollywood war movie...say, GI Jane.The gameplay is pretty bad in every aspect. First, you'll notice bad controls. Second, you'll notice bad AI. And last, before you trade it in or send it back to the video store early...you'll feel this game MIGHT have been alright if it was released 4 years ago."
5,The solution I needed!,"I was looking for a completely contained tape dispenser that would keep lint, dust, etc., from attaching to the exposed side of the tape in my typical cheap half-shell dispenser, when I happened across this. It's just what I needed! I do a lot of scrapbooking and other craft work, where I need to tape things cleanly. This dispenser allows you to tape directly on the page, avoiding getting fingerprints, etc., on the tape.I really don't know what's wrong with these other people who couldn't get theirs to work. I followed the directions on the back of the package to thread the tape, and it worked right away. It cuts the tape with a generous margin, though, so it may take a little practice to get the tape cut exactly where you want.Don't be scared by the negative reviews. Maybe theirs was defective, but mine works perfectly."
1,Don't waste your money,"I am sad to say that this was a total waste of money. It worked GREAT the first two time I used it, then the third time the non-stick coating began peeling off. What a shame, because it actually made great tortillas.. but you can't eat teflon."
1,Very Bad,"On the first day, there was no issues at all it was not sticking and I was able to get a desired roti. Then after ten usage it stopped working. I would never recommend this product to anybody.i would rate this to something more than to worst."
3,"good, but didn't last long...","I wish I could find one of these (electric ones) made with cast iron for making flour tortillas, and get rid of the non-stick coating. It worked well, but didn't hold up as well as I had hoped. The handle broke on mine - just after the warrantee (go figure), but I decided that I didn't want the non-stick coating in the house anymore so I didn't replace it. If they came out with an electric cast iron one that didn't cost a fortune, I'd buy again in a heart beat."
1,never received the right product,I received the wrong product and had to pay for it even though I returned it. They should never have sent a different product even though they did not have it in stock. I was not satisified with this order. Paying for something that I did not want or get in the first place is very dissatisfying.
1,Not so hot!,"This was on the top of my Christmas list...I was so verydisappointed. This tortilla baker doesn't do much, and an inferior job of cooking them. I'm going back to my regular skillet and gas stove. Also the instruction book has ,like,4 pages/2 recipes and not very useful."
5,My brother's favorite story from the 40s!,"The movie follows the book fairly well, and both are interesting and entertaining. The book is a good read, and I think womenmay enjoy the book better than men."
5,Great lens!,"This lens gives me the wide view I often want, without degrading my Canon G9's image quality. I like having a 26mm - 158mm zoom range with this lens attached, with the option of returning easily to 35mm-210mm due to the easy bayonet system."
5,G9 Wide angle lens,"Dont let the little picture fool you. This lens is build solid and has great optics. If you like to shoot your G9, your really gonna love shooting it WIDE!"
4,Very good wide angel lens for G9,"It is really good and very suitable for G9.You don't need to worry about the photo quality using the wide lens. But there is a problem, because of the huge size, so if you use flashlight, the big lens will cut out most of flashlight. In addition, it is a little bite heavy. In a word, it is worthy to own, and I like it."
2,Be Warned! Useless with built-in Flash,"This converter lens is ridiculously large. The photo in the ad doesn't do it justice! While it is quite sharp for a converter lens, its so big, it blocks out the built-in flash on the G9, making it useless for much indoor snap shooting. The crescent shadow cast over the scene, makes it seem like there is an eclipse occurring during in every shot. BE WARNED..."
4,Surprisingly Heavy,"I would just like to point out for those who might be unaware how heavy this lens is in comparison to the camera it's designed for. I don't have a problem with that fact, but when this lens is attached, it becomes impractical to wear the camera around your neck. Be prepared to sling it over your shoulder, or hold it. No qualms about the lens, though; it hasn't left the front of my G7 in a long time."
4,Excellent Investment,"Good, reliable,sturdy but rather bulky. Performs as specified. Cannot use the onboard flash with the converter as it blocks the flash."
4,wide converter lens for g7,"This lens satisfies my need for a wide angle lens except it is almost as big and heavy as the camera. The lens blocks the built in flash, so I had to get a hot shoe flash in order to use the lens with a flash.Haven't had a chance to take any serious pictures with it yet.I have a feeling I am going to have to buy another smaller camera with a 28mm when I go on my next vacation."
2,Useable range is less than advertised,I attempted to use this product in my living room with my home media computer. I need about 7 to 8 feet of range from the USB dongle to the keyboard and mouse. This hardware was not capable of that range without issues with mouse response and key strokes dropping out. All bluetooth keyboards I have tried have worked well at this range. For some reason non-bluetooth wireless keyboards seem to have serious range issues and this one is no exception. Finally the mouse is somewhat narrow and uncomfortable for my hand. It would probably be good for light use but extended use causes my hand to cramp. The keyboard is well built but not as well as my Lenovo laptop keyboard.
3,"Great keyboard, not so good mouse","The keyboard is exactly what I was looking for. I was very frustrated using keyboards using non-IBM standard layouts, like Logitech and HP. Wireless performance is flawless for the keyboard. The mouse is a bit frustrating. It seems to go to standby within seconds of no movement. I need to click on a button to get the mouse to wake up."
1,Mouse designed for ogres...,"Keyboard is fine and of good quality though the keys are a bit tough to press and requires more pressure than I'm used to. This is not thinkpad quality.The killer is the mouse. The mouse probably weighs 1/2 a lb for god knows why. It's gigantic and godawful heavy. If you don't have wrist problems before, you will after using this mouse. The mouse is also elongated and must longer than anything I have ever seen."
3,Disappointing,"Todd Barry's meek delivery and ordinary-schlub persona is hysterical in person and on his website, but this CD of a live show is disappointing. Perhaps the low-key audio needs the low-key visual element, but this one just misses the mark somehow. It's funny and I'm glad to own it, but I suspect this CD won't make it onto the CD player too often."
1,Deathtrap so true!,"My fellow reviewer is totally right: I found this one recently, and was atracted by the line-up, and usually like Houston Person's stuff (I have a couple of); but man, this one... I barely listened to it once, and sold it back to a used record store right away!"
3,Don't believe the hype,"The tv commercial for Triple Play 2001 is deceiving; it shows Ken Griffey, Jr. hitting a homerun while wearing a Reds jersey, unfortunately, on the PlayStation version, he's still a Mariner and you have to trade for him. This is minor, but it matters if you're a hardcore enthusiast. Also, despite what you hear, the graphics are not nearly as good as they were in Triple Play 2000; they are now more cartoonish, and the signature batting styles for certain players is missing in this latest version. Also, it is much harder to control your fielders when you're on defense; balls hit up the middle or to the outfield that should be easy to reach, are not. And, like with other Triple Plays, striking out the computer controlled players is very difficult. Still, despite it's many flaws, the Triple Play series is the best there is. So if you're dying to play a baseball game on your PC or PlayStation, this is as good as it gets."
3,Poor graphics takes away from gameplay,"I know graphics don't make a game, but in this case, with bad controls and poor gameplay, it does. I bought this game because I felt EA Sports was one of the top software companies. They still are, but I think you should look at different games before choosing this one."
5,good but i need help with it,People who have this for the PC i need help. In order to install it you need that code on the back of the box and i threw it out. can someone tell me their code so i can play this game thx
5,Superb and Exquisite Family Movie,"I had to put this on my Wish List. This movie is very well done. The acting is very good and the ending is a happy one. It stirs up the emotions of all ages. It's not overly mystical. It has alittle suspense to it and rounds out very nicely. With so much violence and immorality around these days, this movie is one of the refeshing ones."
3,My dog loves it but...,"This is a fine dog toy with one problem. If it gets stretched by pulling on it, the stitches rip out. In the first month of use it has been repaired 4 times."
1,Your Birthday Sign...etc. Purchased from Amazon and verifiable purchase,"very disappointed hardly any worthwhile info..what was there of no use. worst of all both my son and my dad are early January Capricorns. Since sign begins prior year December 21st continuing to following year to January 21st..January Capricorns were not included. I paid for then returned the book to Amazon for refund..but still had to pay the cost of shipping both ways. there are numerous books available...plus online information regarding people's signs/horoscopes..including famous people & events that occurred on those dates, far less expensive and much more informative. Actually the one star given in the rating is more than it deserves. I definitely DO NOT recommend this book. Do not waste your money on it..that is my definitive advice~"
4,verdy to san carlos,"great book , and fast service. a step back into the 1870's , and a great writer, for the military.I learned a lot about the early americans."
3,A documentary that has no story to tell...,"I was disappointed in this documentary. The school is an interesting place and the head teacher is unusual and all that, but nothing actually happens over the course of the movie. There's no sense of movement. In fact, you could show most of this movie out of sequence and it would be impossible for the viewer to know, because nothing develops or changes throughout the course of the movie. So, after the first 40 minutes, I felt like, ""Okay, I get it. This teacher is verbally abusive, but he's also really into teaching and cares a lot about his kids and about rock 'n roll. Got it. But... so what?""The best documentaries are just as compelling (and often more so) as more conventional dramas and thrillers. They tell stories. ""Rock School"" doesn't really have a story to tell, though. And that makes it kind of boring after a while."
2,YOUR NOT GOOD ENOUGH!,"Maybe it was just the shock of watching a grown man yell things like ""that was f***ing pathetic!"" and ""dont f***ing make mistakes!"" at nine year olds that turned me off about this movie, or maybe it was just bad."
2,THIS AIN'T IT!,"Tull fans, beware! If you want to be happy, get ""Isle of Wight"" or ""Montreux"" (young and old Tull at respective peaks). But this mess...oy... It plays like a bad PBS pledge drive thingy, with uninteresting interview snippets interrupting mediocre song performances in front of a somnolent crowd. Poorly shot, poorly directed, ill conceived from beginning to end. And the supposed ""reunion"" with Mick Abrahams, Glenn Cornick, and Clive Bunker - forget it - a couple of short songs in a dingy pub where nobody in the band but Ian gets off at all. Why bother? Trust me, if you order this you'll hate yourself in the morning."
2,very interesting,This was a O.K. dvd. I thought some of the songs became very long and very tiredsome. I don't think it is one I will watch a lot
4,A Must Have,"I have enjoyed watching this DVD. It was great seeing the original 1968 line up performing together. The reditions of ""Wond'ring Aloud"" and ""Life Is A Long Song"" accompanied with the string quartet were awesome. The DVD has a good selection of old and new material. The performance of ""Budapest"" was superb and shows Tull at their best. The only drawback is that the DVD is not long enough. I would have enjoyed more concert footage and more interviews with the band members and fans. This DVD is a ""must have"" for Tull fans!"
3,Tull fans deserves more than this DVD,"I rushed into buying this DVD and I confess the watchingexperience was not what I expected. The DVD has no flowdue to some interviews that happen between every song. Also,the ""special effects"" during the songs are annoying and""cheap"". They look worse than the effects you can get withyour [price] home video camera.The good side of the concert is that the setlist is goodand the length of the concert is very reasonable (+- 2hours).I'd recommend this DVD if you are a Tull fan but thisis NOT a good sample of what the group is. Anotherconcert was released in Brazil ONLY (region 0).I've ordered mine today. I hopping for a better concert..."
1,Take Heed! It IS visually annoying,"I think Jethro Tull fans are a bit more sophisticated and deserve a little more respect than this DVD offers. I couldn't watch this without think ""Ok when's the next silly special effect coming or are they going to switch to that cheesy outdoor concert...."". You can't listen to it because of all interviews between the songs. It's very annoying. Why did they even attempt to but in the Brittney Spears-like effects in the first place? It's a concert, let them play. The thing that surprises me is that all the interviews and non-concert songs could have been put on at the end as extra bits, it's a DVD for crying out loud, that's what you do! The music is WONDERFUL but seriously I can't say if I'll every 'watch' my copy again."
5,"Fan or not, you'll enjoy the complexity of Tull music","Yes, they're getting older, yes, this isn't the high budget of some more recents group, but, yes, yes, yes, this is quality music present with a quality format and even if you don't watch it, it's worth getting just for the updates given to older hits as well as a few good songs you've never heard before. I highly recommend it if you like Tull at all."
2,The sound is pathetic.,"I was so excited to get this dvd in the mail yesterday as I am a devoted Tull fan. I collected all the albums, bought the gold cd versions, went to the concerts... I was really expecting this dvd to be a treasured part of my Tull collection. Talk about disappointment! The visual quality is there, the conversations with the band was enjoyable but, when it came time for the band to play the sound sounded like it was coming from a tiny am radio. I plan on keeping the dvd but, its likely going to sit on the shelf in my closet and draw dust. What were they thinking when they recorded this?!!!!!!!"
3,Jethro Tull Living with the Past - Now,Great selection of Tull concert favourites interspersed with interesting interviews with band members and fans.Only 2 gripes (hence a 3 star rating). Why is the picture not widescreen and why only a Dolby Stereo Soundtrack as these days anamorphic widescreen and Dolby Digital 5.1 are statndard for recent concert recordings. Other than this heartily recommended.
1,Don't waste your money on this,"Much is said about this DVD. I must admit that i am very dissapointed with it. For me a good concert DVD should be representative of what the concert was like. A concert from start to finish and not overproduced with cheap effects, images from other concerts in between and interviews during the songs (Bouree!)It's a matter of taste I suppose but to give an indication of what I find excellent concert DVD's: Roger Waters'In the FLesh and Roxy Music Live at the Apollo.Another thing that bothers me is the fact that there is no live feel to the DVD. You get the feeling that a lot of songs were recorded without audience during soundcheck or reheasals.It's a shame that an excellent band like Tull who are live very good release a piece of [junk] like this. Avoid this one."
2,"Too much MTV mentality,show concert not the video effects","I sold this dvd a few days after I bought it. I love Jethro Tull but somehow Ian Anderson thinks we want to see video effects. The small club shots are in chunky slow motion, whats the deal? What are people thinking? Are they trying to be artsy?Frustration! It is alot like what the someone did with the Cream Farewell concert at the Royal Albert Hall... video effects completely obscure seeing the band.Rent this one...don't buy it."
2,The worst music DVD ever?,"What was Ian Anderson thinking.Great songs are ruined by the chatting between songs and banter in the middle of songs.A great dissapointment,Tull Fan"
2,Poor Copy of an Original,This is apparently a photo copy of the original that is bound as a book. The copy is not enhanced so it looks like someone used a library copier and bound the results. It appears the original was in a 5 by 7 format and thus the copy has 2 to 3 inch margins. A good book produced in an inappropriate format.
3,forgot something,The top came on time and fit well. Seems the seller forgot to mention it was a second or defective. Bestop forgot to cut the vinyl away on the inside of the rear window. Does provide privacy in the rear seat but not much scenery. Be careful what you order.
4,A carefully crafted yet compulsively delivered gem.,"The emo kids should lend an ear to Kristin Hersh if they want their music with dollops of misery.It is never more eloquently done than on ""Nerve Endings"", the agonised lyrics set against uncomfortable chord changes, with only the elegant string arrangement to provide any balm.""Getting up is what hurts,"" she wails on ""Day Glo"", and sings of being ""twisted in slo-mo by angry water"". (Having had the misfortune to name her last band 50 Foot Wave just before the Asian tsunami, and then mourning the flood disaster in New Orleans, Hersh's own home suffered a burst pipe so destructive that it used up the family savings and forced her to sell up.)As Hersh's spiky work goes, this is less fraught, the sourness of that cracked voice balanced by the sweetness off the strings.Still, it's never exactly easy listening."
3,Just a little is enough,"Kristin Hersh is responsible for some of my favorite recordings in the psycho rock genre. It is difficult to feel less than moved about ""Learn To Sing Like A Star"" as every prior solo album from Kristin made an instant connection to my brain and proceeded to stay there for years and years afterwards. Maybe the stand out cuts like ""Vertigo"", ""Peggy Lee"" and ""The Thin Man"" will eventually allow me to feel this albums overall flow as well as her prior records always have done. As hard as i try though, these songs just don't hang together as a full album for me. Something seems to be missing. I keep playing it over and over waiting for it to finally kick in; but so far, no kick. I will always buy any solo album from Kristin but i was hoping for a stronger effort this time."
3,As good as her other CD's,"How's that for faint praise? Actually, truth be told, it's a little spare, thus the 3 stars, only six of these songs made my MP3 list, which now contains 79 songs, and could have more. The problem is that as fine as this music is, and no question it's far more worthwhile than 99% of the drek dumped on plastic daily, it's really more of the same. Good, sure, but is there any real growth from what she did on ""Hips and Makers"" all those years ago? I don't see it, in fact I'd rate that material higher.So, as much as I like her music, isn't it time for her to move on to something else? She and her charms were wonderful, but maybe it's time to stick with a band, try to build an ensemble sound and see where it can go with a writing partner as an equal. Right now she's spreading her talent a bit thin, and it's starting to tear a bit."
5,I am in love!,"I think this is some of her best work yet, although that is hard to say about such a talented singer/songwriter. I have been playing it over and over since it arrived."
2,I keep laughing,"Yeah, keep laughing for buying a book whose cover promised ""cool"" graphics. Like we say in Portuguese, your book brings ""CU"" (pronounced as ""koo"")graphics. Come on sir, next time we give you a little candy but now it's time for you to cry (and a lot!)."
5,Great book!,"This book had everything I was looking for in a Photoshop Web graphics guide! Lots of cool examples. I got this book because I have purchased other Photoshop books by Mr. Busch. I wasn't dissappointed. Absolute beginners may find some of the explanations confusing, but anyone with a little experience with Photoshop will love this book."
1,A real disappointment...,"Man is this book bad! The writing quality ismediocre; the technical content is horrible.The short list: 1) Files missing from theCD-ROM. 2) Incorrect instructions3) Teeny-tiny, (black and white) before andafter photos with no discernabledifferences... 4) ""Valuable"" tools that Icould not get to install correctly...After reading this book, I feel that somebodyowes me an apology (of course the apology maybe for me being gullible enough to buy a bookwith such a dorky title and expecting to learnsomething...)"
4,You will think he wrote the lyrics by spying on your family!,"This CD is full of true-to-life Christian issues with a country flair. With a great touch of humor, song after song addresses family, being a witness, honoring God--all of which you can easily relate to your life. I had the priviledge of seeing Brent Lamb live, and he is as sincere in person as he comes across in his music. Country music is not my usual pick of musical styles, but this one is definitely worth the listen."
5,Shannon Whirry excellent in a good erotic thriller,"The gorgeous Shannon Whirry keeps the heat turned up in this one as a mysterious lady involved with cop Michael Nouri and maybe involved in some murders. Ms. Whirry is sometimes the sole reason to watch a movie but this time she is in a pretty darn good movie. Good characters and plot with some actual suspense and mystery. Still, Shannon Whirry is worth the price of admission all on her own. She's all that and a bag of chips! Check her out in this hot erotic thriller and see why Joe Bob and I think she's the true Queen of this genre."
3,Good but needs some polishing,"Really liked the workout, however towards the end of the 30 minute workout his counts aren't consistent and he begins to lose time with the music. Making it difficult to switch moves easily."
3,"Classic UK ""stenchcore""","I was a little disappointed when i heard this for the first time. I had heard so much hype about DI and then the first 4 tracks were just minimal and kinda boring...But it grew on me. This has the first 7"", and the two LPs that came out after that. the First LP ""Rock n Roll Conformity"" is more punk than metal, and the Second LP ""Gutteral Breath"" is more metal than punk, due to the guitarist becoming the lead vocalist.I do think its worth buying to hear how crust originated (I think that DI coined the word crust), and because there are two whole LPs and a 7"". Its worth the money, but I would get Amebix or Axegrinder if you want the masters of 80's UK crust. Actually, forget nostalgia rock- go out and find Hellshock, Stormcrow, Against//Empire or Crow if you want to hear punks playing metal."
4,Battery is fine,"This item came quickly, was nicely packed, and it works in the camera just fine. This is a great item. You should have a spare charged up and ready to go at all times. M"
4,exellent,"is a very good complement to the iPad, easy to use, friendly, and very light, compact. strong, pretty colors, almost perfect"
2,Good charger but battery no longer made by Nikon...,"The Charger works well. Charges the battery fairly fast, and its simple to operate. But the battery is no longer made by Nikon. If you want a battery it has to be an after Market battery.... So instead of paying lots of money for this Charger, a person is better off buying an after market unit..."
3,Worth it for the Scott Walker track....,"It's nice to see Scott Walker hit the mainstream (sort of) again! His ""Only Myself To Blame"" (left out of the movie...bummer) is far and away the best track on the CD. The rest of the music is just OK soundtrack music. Buy it for the Walker track."
4,More than a few Bond-ing moments...,"The best Bond score since John Barry unfortunately bears ugly scars. The synthesizers ramble on louder than the orchestra, swiftly drowning some highly effective and evocative composing, including good melodies and bold orchestrations. It is a worthy attempt to update the 007 sound, but some imbecile decision-making buried the interesting material under layers of dentist drill noises (which could be appropriately and intelligently used were they not so conspicuous)."
1,Not as I good as I thought it would be ...,"The overall quality of this soundtrack is far - very far! - away from soundtracks like ""A view to a kill"" or ""Tomorrow never dies"". I can only recommend the title song as being quite good to listen to ... the rest of the soundtrack is basically trash - especially if you are a fan of the music of John Barry."
2,Loaded With Synth,"This is an almost dissapointment to David Arnolds music. The whole CD is loaded with synth music and drums which is not a really good mix. Tomorrow Never Dies was alot better that this CD. Although Tomorrow Never Dies forgot most of the music on the CD. But back to this CD, it's missing some of the more enjoyable ques from the movie. Like when Bond and Elektra were about to go skiing. Plus the gun barrel scene from the beginning of the movie. There are only a few enjoyable ques form this CD. Such as Ice Bandits, I Never Miss, Submarine, and the akward titled Caviar Factory. There are only a few tracks that only use the orchestra. Which Arnold should have used instead of heavy synth and drums. Such examples is Submarine. Arnold should have leaned more to the Orchestra intead of heavy synth.In other words; The World Is Not Enough, well is NOT enough!"
4,Surprising.,"June 25, 2002Any soundtrack junkies out there (like myself) shouldpick this one up. While the movie that shares its namewas nothing special in the least, there's a good varietyof material here, including a couple of great actiontracks. I even liked the title song by Garbage, a bandI wouldn't otherwise know from floor lint.With franchise soundtracks growing shorter and morerepetitive all the time, there's a lot of exceptionalfun to be had with this one."
1,David Arnold is no John Barry!,"David Arnold (who is greatly over-rated in my opinion) gives us another uninspired knock-off of a John Barry score. If only Arnold had half the talent of John Barry this soundtrack might be worth a listen. I understand that David Arnold can't read music, and relies on a (better musically educated) co-worker to actually translate his ""compositions"" into a music score. Arnold's Bond scores are hackneyed and un-original. Adding contemporary bands like Garbage and Propellerheads (who are also as talentless as Mr Arnold) is a waste of time. Compare this garbage to Eric Serra's wonderful soundtrack for ""GoldenEye"" and you won't bother to buy this lack-lustre CD. Instead of using a poor-man's John Barry to score their movies, the Bond producers would do themselves (and the audience) a favor by hiring the real thing for their next 007 adventure."
1,Could Be Better,I thought the original 007 music was dull. Now I think I think I wasted my money on that CD
5,Best James Bond Movie ever!,"Best James Bond Movie in the millininum! Although my favourite Bond actor is R. Moore, Brosnan did an exellent job on this movie. The title song is not the best of the JB songs, but its pretty good if you like soft-loud-soft (harmony, melody, harmony) pop. The other songs are pretty cool because its action music. Very useful for pantomine theatre."
3,The score loses direction,"More than the title song by garbage (who incidentally did a so-so job),I would say the highlight was ""Elektra's theme"" it was gentle but yet had this depth, which was incredibly moving to listen to. Its worth a buy, for only die hard bond fans, though."
4,Good but Missing Essential Music,"David Arnold's THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH is good but I was disappointed that it was missing some essential music. The gun barrel opening music was outstanding as it went into immediately into the following scene in Bilbao, Spain. Also, the End Title that was essentially another innovative rendering of THE JAMES BOND THEME is missing. The Garbage Main Title song is adequate but seems to have aged with time. Also, Arnold let a lot of synthetic techno elements run throughout the soundtrack. This soundtrack does contain a good wealth of music but something seems to have gone amiss since Arnold's 2 outstanding TOMORROW NEVER DIES albums."
3,Could have been better!,"After a really good score for TND I had great expectations listening to this score. Unfortunately it has not much developed from the TND score. I like track 2,3,4,6,10,18 most. The Garbage Title Song is not a highlight in Bond history I think. David Arnold could be the man for the upcoming Bond films if he finds new inspirations and a little bit less electronics. I would have given a better rating if this score had followed Goldeneye, which was a poor score. But after TND, I had expected more."
5,"""Garbage"" is fantastic as usual","I gotta confess, I'm not a big Bond fan. But I adore ""Garbage"" and Shirley Manson's amazing voice. And this song delivers completely. A wonderful song...with a wonderful video, by the way, for anyone who hasn't seen it..go see it and go buy this disk!"
5,Da Devil's Playground,"This Is Some Straight Killa. In My Opinion, there is no other three six mafia album that beats harder. I would Prefer you to get this album."
3,"Back in the day great, as for now...","When this originally was released way back when it was very very ""tight"".However a re-release of this did not carry the same weight. I purchased this just to replace the old cassette I had.Koopsta is my favorite of the clique but I was dissapointed with the CD.There are only a couple of songs I can still play regularly today."
1,I Just Wanted to remind you!,"Koopsta Knicca's cd has alot of tight beats. This is really won of the best 36 cd's out there, it's got the beats and the scratchin' that just makes you want to ""Get Crunk"" as they say. But the uncrunkiest thing was that all the cuss words in the songs are all sratched out! WHAT'S THE BIZ?"
1,WHY EDITED?,I heard great things about this cd. however when i popped it in my player the 1st song was edited. i thought this must be a mistake because it had a parential advisory sticker. but the whole cd turned out to be edited. ALL SWEAR WORDS ARE REPLACED WITH ANNOYING RECORD SCRATCHES. i even bought another copy. they are all edited. DO NOT BUY THIS CD. or maybe buy the real edited copy. who knows???
5,Ooh!Ooh!Oooh!,"I am a HUGE fan of neopets and I'd really like to get this game.Please please please release it a little early!Please?Oh,and I thoutht it was PS2...if it isn't that's okay cause' Playstation 2 can run PS1 games,but then their not as high quality.Oh well,I'll always like neopets.my username is gelerts_rock_hard."
1,Sorry for annoying everyone...,"I know its annoying when people tend to write a review for a game before it comes out, but I really had to point some things out. I wouldn't recomend this game to anyone unless you are extremely desperate. Neopets is already an online game that isn't very good at that. A playstation game really won't do to much to improve on the already bad characters and goofy items. Knowing the neopets things well enough, this game will be filled with faeries and magical tigers, petpets, and petpetpets. The whole neopets team is just out of whack for coming up with this game.This isn't supposed to really help you. Its not a review, nor a hate mail type thing. But it just isn't going to be very appealing to fellow gamers. Thanks."
1,neopets the darkest faerie,"I am the mom of a 10 year old...who would love to own this game. My question is...has it been released, where can you buy it and does it exist? I called Sony, they say it does, but no one owns it or has played it. Can anyone help? I rated it 1 because I don't even know if there is such a game! But if it is like the Neopet site...I am sure it will be at least a 5"
5,Wow!,I really would like to play this game. I like that you can play with characters from differen worlds.
1,RELEASE CANCELED,"From the neopets news 1st of November 2003: ""UPDATE - A while back we mentioned that we were working on a PlayStation game called The Darkest Faerie, well there have been a few delays. Basically we felt that it couldn't achieve everything we wanted it to on the PS1 and so we are going to re-make it as a PS2 game (so the graphics will be much better!) and it will be out in 2005. Don't worry, it's only 49,538,673 seconds away (roughly!)Sorry about that. The good news, however, is that the game will feature evil faeries, werelupes, a zombified King Skarl, Illusen, gigantic Draik skeletons, the legendary land of Talador and the (possible) total and utter destruction of Faerieland (unless you can stop her!) ""Personally, I'd much prefer they make a higher quality game than turn out something that's junk like they have with so much other stuff.. Then again, I really wish they'd spend more time focusing on the site and players than the merchandise, but ah well."
5,Not the game,"This is not the game anymore, people. It is now to be a ps2 game and it has a new, better cover. Too see it, search for neopets on toys ""r"" us website, and check the first page."
4,Awesome!,"This game looks awesome, and I can't wait till the neopets team comes out with more games. I have always been a fan of neopets, and especially the lupes. (the wolfy like guys on the front with the swords and the black one, the werelupe king.) Ordinarilly, I would give it five stars, but I take one off for not making it on more than one system. This is bad for me, because I'm not allowed to have any form of video game other than computer. But all my friends say when they buy it, they'll let me try."
4,Intake,This item came brand new in the case although in the picture it shows that it comes with 2 black hoses and when I opened mine it came with 1 really short hose that was of no use to me so I had to go out and get my own to make this application fit. Overall the intake itself is awesome I love it.
2,Doesn't Work on XM2GO by Tao,"Despite advertising saying this antenna would work with my XM2GO radio, the antenna jack would not fit into the radio. I was able to return the product with no hassle, so I have no complaints other than poor advertising indicating the antenna was compatible with my radio."
1,Timex XM radio,This antenna does not fit the Timex XM clock-radio antenna port.Therefore you must guess which XM radios it might fit.
5,great item!,great antenna! truly durable. i can't believe the weather it has gone thru & still going strong. we keep it in our shed & it has gone thru several diff kinds of weather conditions.
3,Not for Pioneer Inno,"The three stars are a compromise, because I have not really used this product. I bought it for my Pioneer Inno, but the plug does not fit the Inno jack. To be fair, the product was not advertised as being for the Inno, but since another Pioneer product was mentioned, I thought that it was worth a try. Antenna is inexpensive enough to just write it off to experience, but I thought that other Inno users might want to know to look elsewhere."
2,This album is not the best,"There are a very scarce amount of good songs on this cd, one of them is sign of the cross. That is the only good song on the album and that's why I gave it 2 stars. I love iron maiden and this album is a dissapointment. If you like iron maiden, then I'd stay away from this album because there are better maiden albums out there like powerslave. I'm just glad no more maiden albums are like this because Bruce Dickonson made his return in a brave new world.(which is another awesome maiden album)This album just isn't good at all except for sign of the cross. This cd kinda made me think less of maiden until I heard brave new world which boost my love of maiden all the way up again. If you love iron maiden than steer clear of this cd."
1,Just not good,"As a long time maiden fan, I have seen and heard every incarnation of the band. Though the music is good by most other metal standards, it is not maiden without Bruce in the front. I like the current lineup with 3 guitars, but Bruce, Steve, Adrian, Dave and Nicko are the only lineup that ever put out anything worth buying.Remember this. Some of the most memorable music is music you can sing to. Bruce gives you something to soar with. This dude is a grunt. Just not a maiden romp. They classed themself into a metal genre, as opposed to definng it.But hats off to the guys for saying ""F-you Bruce! We love this to much to quit!""Well, at least for a little while. Thank god they are all together again. Everything after Bruce's return (and before his departure) is sooooooooo much better than this."
1,"Blaze Bayley Sucks, and drags the whole album to the gutter","I have just started to get back into Iron Maiden (No Prayer for the Dying was my last Maiden album) and I have enjoyed some of the albums that Maiden has put out after the early 90's time period, BUT then I stumbled across this. Good think I downloaded the thing before I bought it. Music is fine, but Blase Bayley kills this album. I can think of a hundred different people I would have sung lead before this clown. Even though he might try to imitate Bruce Dickenson, he cant even come close to his range, and his voice would be suited better for Death Metal considering that if he screams it would be an improvement over his singing. Its a shame, cause there is some good music here, but Bayley is so un-listenable, I cant even enjoy it. Maiden has so many other albums to choose from, dont even bother with this crapola. (Maybe one day the could re-record it with Dickinson)"
1,Sixteen dollars for this???!!,"Well, CD prices are reaching an all-time absurd high standard. Everybody knows that THE X-FACTOR is a joke, one of Maiden worst albuns ever, with songs cloning each other, uninspired performance by the musicians....well, a total waste (except for SIGN OF THE CROSS)."
2,Blaze's First Kinda Bored Me.,"Well Its 1995 when Maiden release this cd with new vocalist Blaze Bayley. I remembered when the single ""Man On The Edge"" came out and thought it sounded like ""Be Quick Or Be Dead"" Part 2 which was cool. Then I got the album and at the time was dissapointed it collected dust for a while but afterwards I started listening again and it got someone better. Not a powerful performance by Maiden very dark,almost barely audible cd. Next to No Prayer this is the worst. Blaze's second and Final Studio release blew away this one Virtual XI was classic Maiden. This barely holds 2 stars."
1,I Tried Too.....Yuck!,"Sorry to the few that like this cd, but this albumn really sucks! I absolutely LOVE Iron Maiden, but the singer is horrible...in this band anyway. He needs to go back to Wolfsbane. I'm sooooo glad that Bruce and Adrian are back with the band; I know they can pull Iron Maiden out of the mud. Check out their first 7 cds! All of 'em are awesome! Up the Irons!"
1,"I tried my best, but...","I did my best to like this albun, the beginning of Blaze BAyley in Iron, but it is horrible. Just it: horrible, no inspiration at all. The only good song is the epic ""SIgn of the Cross"", with more than 11 minutes."
2,worst maiden CD,"OK this album is not as bad as some might have you think.However, it is possibly the worst maiden record done. Blaze Bayley can't stand up to the great Bruce Dickinson. He is not a bad singer,(not great either), but does not have the personality or the voice or anything else to front Iron Maiden. This album does not sound like Maiden what-so-ever. But thankfully Bruce is back where he belongs...in Iron Maiden, and as for blaze, who cares?"
4,"Great Singer, Fading Band","Whatever iron Maiden fans say, Iron maiden is just fading, erasing themselves out of heavy mertal History. This is a very Good cd Vocaly speaking, awesome voice and awesome lyrics, but the music... oh the music... what music? Honestly... Iron Maiden is no longer what it used to be, It is a good buy, that way you'll meet Blaze Bayley, hes a god but you'll regret ever being a Harris Fan, he never was good and he never will be... I think I'm being too nice with these 4 stars."
3,"John ""Ira"" doesn't have it exactly right...","It's more like going out to eat at a really nice place with an odd looking woman. I think the fast food comparison is better suited to Warrant, or some such radio friendly garbage. All of Maiden's efforts are pretty classy. But agreed: this one doesn't work as well as their best."
1,THis isn't even a CD ....,"STEVE made such a horrible album, and tells everyone that it is one of the best ever produced by Maiden... How ? It has a horrible singer ( correction: a good singer caught in a band losing its creative genius ), a barely tolerable second guitarrist (Janick Gers), some incredibly lousy songs (like ""2 A.M."" and ""BLOOD ON THE WORLD'S HANDS"") and a pair of songs identical to each other !!!! I tought this was the bottom for Maiden, until ""VIRTUAL ELEVEN"" came out and it was worse !! But ""BRAVE NEW WORLD"" put things in place ocne and for all... (Although not being a masterpiece)"
2,trash,"I bought this when it came out, all excited because Maiden was not dead after all. I threw it in the trash a few days later. It put me to sleep. Contrary to the tree-worshippers might say, the lyrics were the only redeeming feature. Just horrible! None of the songs ever seem to get off the ground. I gave it 2 stars because it's Maiden, so it's better than 90% of what else is out there."
1,Let's pretend,"let's pretend, just for a second, that Iron MAiden never recorded this CD, that Jannick Gers never entered the band, that Dickinson never left. REady! Now you can go to bed as a happy person, continuing to be a big Maiden fan! Up The IRons !"
2,Disappointment.,"I'm sorry to say it but this album was great disappointment to me.I've been a Maiden fan for 17 years and I must confess I haven't expected such a bad staff.I've been trying to accept this album since I've bought it but so far I haven't succeeded.The songs are slow, monotonous and somehow boring.The only decent song is ""Man on the edge"".Fortunately the next album ""Virtual XI"" sounds much better.You'd better try it instead of this one."
3,"Can't say it's bad, but...","This album could have been better. There's nothing wrong with Bayley's voice; it's just that it's incapable of carrying the sheer Shakespearean melodrama that became a trademark of the Maiden sound (along with the wailing double leads and sort of ""rollicking"" rhythms). ""X Factor"" is simply the mark of band that got too used to writing for one voice to adequately transition to another's."
5,The Most Underrated Album Ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A Dark Materpiece!!!!!!!!!!,This Album is the most underrated album ever. Thi is a very serious album that is why I love it . When I first heard it I thought it was the most boring album I have ever heard. But now I have realized that this is great. This shows you how horrible war is. I hate war and love this album. It also shows that Maiden could write great stuff without Bruce . People Bruce is not Iron Maiden .Iron Maiden was made by the genius Steve Harris. Blaze Bailey is a great replacement. I feel sad for Blaze because he doesn't get the credit that he deserves. The Sign of the Cross is one of the best songs by Iron Maiden. It is a classic. This Album doesn't have any happy songs. IT IS THE MOST UNDERRATED ALBUM EVER. UP THE IRONS ONCE AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,HORRIBLE EXCUSE FOR SINGING,"First of all, I have been an Iron Maiden fan for 14 years but this album is horrible. For those of you who say Blaze is a good singer, you know nothing about music. He doesn't even sing in key half the time. The only song that is bearable at all is Edge of Darkness. There is a cool Steve Harris bass solo on the album but other than that, don't waste your money. Buy Accident of Birth and Chemical Wedding by Bruce Dickinson with Adrian Smith. Thank God they are back with Maiden. Maiden should have gotten John Arch(ex Fates Warning) or Michael Kiske(ex Helloween) instead of this guy. This guy is so horrible that he makes Poison sound like they have Opera training."
3,"Good album, ahead of it's time.","Underated work. Finally Maiden abandon the juvenile horror theatrics of the earlier 80's and develop a more intelligent, thoughtful approach. X has a heavier, almost gothic tone that's really very effective. The problem is clearly many of Maiden's fans remain stuck in the world of juvenile comic-book metal with it's tedious old themes. Come on people, you are no longer sixteen! Grow up, like the band have. The 80's are long gone and what was fresh back then is SO stale now. Forget the negative's. This is a good, solid piece of work. Give it a go."
2,"Just for the song ""Man on the edge""","When Bruce Dickinson left the band to go solo, Iron Maiden got Blaze Bayley on vocals. There was a big difference between the more high pitch approach from Dickinson and the low pitch Bayley. It's obvious who is best suited for Maiden. The material on ""The x factor"" is rather weak with exception of the fast and attractive ""Man on the edge"" - a song based on the movie ""Falling down"", starring Michael Douglas. You can easily skip this album, since there are at least 500 better albums to spend your money on."
1,One star for sign of the cross,"THe one star here goes for Sign Of The Cross alone, because this is great song, no matter who sang it. The rest of the CD is junk, I can't even recognize it. But the blame is in the production shoulders. The songs could have sounded a lot better had not Steve Harris thought that he could make it. He could not. The exit of Martin Birch affetcted the band incredibly, and they never recovered from it."
1,VERY VERY BAD.,"Ok. THis is Maiden. THis is Steve Harris and DAve Murray and Nicko McBrain. So, of course the playing here has its moments. But the trouble here is the production. It made the band sound weak and uninspired. The compositions are also very irregular. LOOK FOR THE TRUTH and FORTUNES OF WAR are the same song, they begin with the same chords at the same order!!!!!!But gone are the harmony solos, so great in the times of Murray / Smith. Gone are Dickinson's powerful vocals, strong and clear. (Blaze is great - it's just that Bruce is much better). Also, Maiden always wrote great albums when they recorded eight or nine songs per album. Now, we have twelve. So, quality drops.If you're a completist, you must own this album. If not, and if you have the Best of The Beast compilation, you're well served, because it contains THE X-FACTOR only memorable Maiden song, SIGN OF THE CROSS."
1,Yuck!!,"This cd blows! Don't even think of buying this one! The music is great, but the vocals suck! Thankfully Blaze is gone!! YES, BRUCE AND ADRIAN ARE BACK! There is a new albumn out the end of '99! The X-Factor sucks! Don't waste your money."
3,Not iron maiden,"Well, Blaze is not this cd problem, the problem are the slow beats, the basic drums and repetitive and slow riffs, we missed old riffs, why is that? because Adrian Smith left the band, Janick gers is not as good as him, Gers contribution is not bad, but is not the same.This album is also not well recorded, Blaze's voice is not clear, and has an awfull sound in general, its best song is man on the edge, is one of the greates maiden songs but in the last prechorus blaze's dont do it as the first (when he says ""man on the edge"" its not the same tone.Finally its unfair that people give the x factor problem to blaze, hes a good singer,hes not the same as bruce,you cant compare theme because they have different type of voices, if you dont believe that blaze is a good singe, just listen to his new recordings."
2,An Iron Maiden album comprised mostly of ballads...,"If you've been a fan of the powerhouse vocals of Bruce Dickinson, then you may be disappointed by the more tame tracks sung by the new vocalist Blaze Bayley on ""The X Factor."" The lyrics are good, and the musicianship is great as always, but I fear that that the hard-driving tunes that we have come to expect from Iron Maiden are absent on this effort. However, if you are a big fan of their slower melodies from previous albums, then this will be a good one to pick-up and give Blaze Bayley a listen. Lastly, the rating of two stars is given in comparison to their previous albums, which are--simply--better releases."
1,"FOR GOD'S SAKE, OPEN YOUR EYES!","The trouble with Maiden in the nineties was not Blaze Bayley. The trouble was guitarrist Janick Gers, a talentless songwriter for Maiden style (while in Dickinson's first solo album, he did it alright), who could not help the band at all when Steve Harris' own creative talent began to wane. In X-FACTOR, the trouble is even bigger due to: bad production; lack of energy by the band; ausence of Bruce Dickinson; exccess of songs (making their level drop). ANyway, the guys have more money than I will ever have, and they deserve it every cent, due to great albuns, hard touring, honest approach to music and rock. But to say X-FACTOR is a great album it's simply not true."
1,Blaze is not Iron Maiden. Bruce Is Iron Maiden.,"I bought this CD because I haven't read any metal magazine for a long time, and I didn't know who is the replacement for Bruce. This is a totally disappointing album. I can understand that Steve can right darker moods of a song, but Blaze? PLease! He is a sorry excuse to be a part of Maiden. Ok, Blaze has a mysterious dark voice (that's why they call him ""the Dark Lord""), but he can do better than that! My dog can sing better than him. Bruce's voice can be dramatic to operatic to volcanic. Air Raid Siren is God."
2,He's no Paul Di'Anno or Bruce Dickinson,"Well Iron Maiden fans, here it is. Blaze Bayley is just not that great a singer. Musically, the cd is pretty good, with the songs obviously Steve Harris material, but they lack vocal intensity. Blaze just does not have the vocal range of Dickinson or the metal prowess of Paul Di'Anno, the original and best Maiden vocalist. If you're a Maiden fan, the cd is worth getting, but it's a poor choice for someone new to Maiden. A newcomer to the Iron Maiden fold would be much better served by the debut album,Iron Maiden, Killers or Number of the Beast (despite the horrible Gangland). There are a few tracks on this cd worth a listen; Lord of the Flies and Fortunes of War are pretty good, but the rest just fails to live up to prior Maiden efforts. Anyway, Dickinson is back (to bad it's not Di'Anno) and we should get some real Iron Maiden again."
1,GREAT TO HAVE YA BACK BRUCE,THIS WAS BY FAR THE WORST IRON MAIDEN ALBUM EVER.BLAZE WILL NEVER REPLACE BRUCE.HE TRIED AND HE FAILED.BUT GOOD NEWS IS THAT THEY WILL HAVE A NEW ALBUM OUT IN THE FALL
2,Iron Who?,"Iron Maiden without Bruce Dickinson is not Iron Maiden. It may be good music...(reluctantly..), but if its not the legendary front man that helps define Iron Maiden, its not for real.If you are new to Iron Maiden, dont start here!Reach back to when this band first picked up Bruce Dickinson and hear the prime time. In my opinion those albums are; Number of the Beast, Piece of Mind and Somewhere in Time.These are thier 3 best albums. of the three... ""Piece of Mind"" IS the Maiden masterpiece of them all and the strongest Dickinson performance."
3,Give it a chance folks! Variety is a good thing.,"I'll admit that the orginal Maiden albums from 1980-1988 are hard to beat. The band did hit a lull for a while in the 1990's. Priest did as well, as did Ozzy, Metallica and even Megadeth. Instead of packing it in and/or living off past glories Maiden (and others as well) decided to carry on and forge ahead. X Factor is a good album in its own right. Blaze doesn't have the range of Dickenson or Dianno, and his performance is (in my opinion) kind of flat and uninspiring but those were huge shoes that I'm not sure anyone could've filled. It's not a neccessity, even for a completist, but for those with willing ears and open minds you should at least enjoy it a bit. Not a great album, but not a bad one either."
3,Where is Bruce?,"Picking up this album I tried to keep an open mind. I knew Bruce was gone, and it was damn' hard to imagine anyone else in the lead of Iron Maiden. It was still hard after hearing Blaze Bayley being downed everywhere. Blaze is not as good as Dickinson, but he was trying to do the impossible, lifting Dickinsons heritage is unimaginable, and just how much Dickinson IS Iron Maiden becomes apparent.But he does a good job (...). The man can actualy sing, and I think most people that put him down might be biased.The album is much darker than usualy from Iron Maiden with the strongest tracks being Sign of the Cross and Man on the Edge. Harris is still a strong songwriter but this just does not seem like Iron Maiden without Bruce in the lead. The album is fine, nothing really wrong with it...but on the other hand nothing really great about it either"
2,MAIDEN can do better than that .,"There is no excuse. This album is horrible. I didn't give it one star because of ""Sign of the Cross"", basically. Where the hell Steve Harris found this singer Blaze Bayley? (now gone for sure from the band) But is not only him. The music is without any inspiration at all, and Maiden reachs the point of shameless cloning their own songs, in two of the tracks that are identical to each other!!! Of course, you may become acostumed to it after a while, because it's Maiden who is playing. But...hear ""Accident of Birth"", by Bruce Dickinson, and you'll understand why Steve called him back..."
3,"X-FACTOR: GREAT LYRICS,HORRIBLE VOICE","This is not such a horrible album, but Blaze Bailey IS NOT the frontman that Iron Maiden need.In some songs he was not very bad, but when i imagine Bruce singing songs like man on the edge just one question comes to my mind:How did Blaze got enter to the most famous band in the world.How the band chose that guy. In the shows he is a disaster.He destroied all the classics that Bruce immortalized. WELCOME BACK TO YOUR THRONE,BRUCE!!!"
4,"Boo-hoo, no Bruce...","Cry me a river...I've more recently gotten into Maiden, actually starting with Brave New World. Quite honestly the only reason I bought and listened to this (and Virtual XI) was to see WHY it was so bad. I'm weird like that. I seem to give the ""worst"" of the albums a try and somehow wind up liking them. While Blaze isn't Bruce--what did you expect, a clone?--he holds his own here.You have to give Blaze some credit for keeping the band alive for Bruce to come back to and make Brave New World, which is simply amazing!!Good effort here!!"
3,Not as bad as I use to think it was.,"I admit it...I was a Blaze Bayley basher for many many years.I really diddnt even give him a chance at all I like many fans, hated him sight unseen (lol) when I first heard his name in a Metal Mag back in like 93.I just this year (2001) bought this CD and it is not half as bad as I thought it would be.The song ""Sign of the Cross"" is a true Maiden Classic.""Fortunes of war"" and ""Lord of the Flies"" are exelent songs that will remind you of the old days. THis CD sounds alot like ""Brave New World"" to me.I do think this CD would be better with Bruce Dickinson on vocals,but he is not so no use wishing.YOu just need to accept this record for what it is."
1,What was Steve Harris thinking?,"First of all I am and will always be a huge maiden fan. I am also not a purist who thinks that Bruce is irreplaceable as great as he is, but what the hell were they thinking when they picked this guy to repalace one of the greatest metal singers in history. I found myself cringing at the vocals. I listened to the album twice and that is all I and my devout Maiden friends could bear.I felt that maiden started to lose it with no prayer, but this is terrible.Thank goodness for Brave New World. If you have never listened to Iron Maiden avoid this album, start with Piece of Mind, Powerslave, or most of the stuff between 79-88. Sorry Blayze, nothing personal."
3,Maybe my taste has changed,"As a teenager G&L were one of my favourites, so I bought this to compensate for losing their LPs in a house move many years ago. While some of the tracks are still good (Runaway, Heart on my sleeve, Breakaway) I seem to remember a lot of material that was better than the stuff that has made it onto this 'Best of'."
1,"I ordered After Shave Balm, but received a Pre-shave oil (too much trouble to send back)",I did not receive the After Shave Balm....Pre-shave Oil was received (I did not want to go to the trouble to send back).
3,Meh,"Don't get me wrong, the album is good. The problem is it just sounds like everything I've already heard before. Take As I Lay Dying guitars and throw on some early Nodes of Ranvier vocals and you have My Bitter End. It's pretty, but both of the aforementioned bands do the job better. I laugh at people calling this ""technical."" If you want technical, listen to Converge, Dillinger Escape Plan, BTBAM, and The Number 12 Looks Like You. I still recommend this for someone looking for a way to ease into this genre, but beyond that I would say take a pass."
4,"Mista Klean from the group ""Warrior Company""","I have alot of respect for this balla from houston, he's always representin' us hard, much love baby boy. Ya'll check out our new cd, Complications of tha Mind."
5,An absolutely delicious anthology...,"I purchased this book for a class, but was delighted to discover that I will definitely want to hang onto it afterwards. The translations chosen for the 'Ancient World' portion are, for the most part, delightfully vivid and capture the spirit of the original language. I also like the layout - the margin size is just perfect for taking notes."
4,College level,"I bought this to use with Tapestry of Grace curriculum, and used it with a 14 yr old fresh out of public school. It was way beyond her vocabulary level and reading skill set. This is a book I have seen used in college classes, and it figures, because much of the poems and plays are written in old or medieval English. We ended up scrapping this book most of the time and reading the same works in modern English online.Having said that, for a child who is used to a classical education, this collection of works would be a pleasure to read."
5,Wonderful Textbook or Addition to Personal Library,"I purchased this book for my Literature class. Unfortunately we did not get to read all of the works. I have fallen in love with this book and I hope to keep it for many many years. Some of the works can be boring but if you keep an open mind and concentrate on the ideas, language, and meaning you will understand even the most boring of works."
2,Required reading for college.,"Another heavy Norton Anthology. The Illiad, the Odyssey and a few other books are found in this anthology. Since I had never read them, i found them interesting, yet i'm not a fan of lugging anthologies around... terrible on the back."
4,Good,The book is in good condition little ruff edges on the outside cover. Some of the pages have dog ears but for the most part the book was kept in excellent shape.
3,For Class,"I bought this textbook for a Humanities class I am taking, and it kinda sucked to read, a lot of words on a page and lots of pages to read."
3,A Sewing Genie Review,"I got the Sewing Genie for Christmas last year. When I got it, it worked perfectly fine. But after a while whenever I would try to sew, the thread would break. Also, I found that it was only big enough to make small things. In all I think that this product is good for making knick-knacks, but not for a full time hemming job."
4,Hysterical,"If you are looking for that one of a kind movie that makes your stomach hurt from laughing while you are crying, this is the movie to see. I don't think there was one person in the theater with a dry eye. Hysterical!! It's definitely worth seeing!!"
5,"Hysterical, ridiculous movie. Highly recommended!","This movie is smartly foul, hilariously disgusting and hugely laugh-out-loud funny. I WOULD show my mother this. Maybe not my grandmother, but definitely my mother."
1,really?,"I rented this movie because i was in the mood for a funny guy movie. Well, i expected it to be pretty bad based on the title, but holy cow it blew my mind on how bad it actually was! It went way to far in some aspects (watch if you really want to see) and was just much worse than i expected. I was just speechless that i wasted 2 hours of my life watching that bad of a movie. Only rent if you want to see how bad this movie really is."
2,Don't be mislead !,"Terrible movie, those tat reviewed it high must not leave thir homes often and have apparently run out of things to watch! Terrible!"
2,Misleading picture,"I agree with the reviews that say sizing is way off. It is tiny! Also, very different from the advertised picture. Probably about one tenth of the toole. Looks more like a purple skirt with a few small pieces of toole aroung the waist that isnt even as long as the lining! Looks straggly and cheap. I'm going to have to purchase tool and do some sewing before Halloween!"
3,Dissapointed,"I had purchased a book previously by this author and was very pleased with it, so I ordered this one expecting it to be the same. This book doesn't have the detailed illistrations that the other one does and therefore was a big disapointment. I suppose my disapointment is mostly my fault, if I had ""looked inside"" before ordering I would have realized it wasn't what I wanted."
5,"So tough, you can practically feel the grit on your tongue","This violent little gem ranks right up there with ""The French Connection"" in the pantheon of early 70s urban crime thrillers. Smartly edited, paced like an out of control freight train, and with fabulous location work that bellows authenticity, ""Across 110th Street"" deserves a far bigger cult. Stir in Anthony Quinn's inimitable basset hound charm, Yaphet Kotto's steely cool, Anthony Franciosa's reptilian sneer and the raspy voiced dude from Brubaker and you have a combustble confection that belongs in the collection of every discerning action movie fan. Oh, I almost forgot to mention Antonio Fargas' so-cool-it-hurts supernova wardrobe and the bleak poetry of the final shootout, including a freeze frame ending that will stay with you for days. Aces all around."
3,Could Have Been Really Good.,"I honestly think that Across 110th Street could have been a really good film as opposed to one that now has the reputation of being a B Movie. Yaphet Kotto was great as Lieutenant Pope but he was one of the few individuals in this production who gave his role the appropriate subtlety. I love Anthony Quinn but found his Captain Mattelli to be way over the top. Honestly, the amount of racism on display in the relations between blacks and whites is truly frightening and clashes mightily with reality. Indeed, such levels of racial animosity were likely not ever present in a northern city after the end of The Civil War. It just did not sit right with me and prevented my truly enjoying the film. The topic, the conflict between the mob and the Harlem syndicate, could not be any more interesting, however. The same can be said of the intense amount of corruption that plagued the NYPD during the 1970s."
1,HIGH EXPECTATIONS,"With all the hype i have heard about this movie, i was expecting a lot more out of it. Though the soundtrack was a good one, the plot of this movie really was corny. I've watched it several times after my initial viewing and it still didn't appeal to me. I am a big fan of the soul cinema, blackexploitation era but this particular movie was not worth it. If your a collector, i suggest you purchase it, otherwise don't waste your money like i did."
5,A Pleasant Memory,"I remember this being the first ""R"" rated movie I ever saw. I viewed it during a matinee performance in Wallingford, Connecticut at the downtown theatre that no longer exist. It was gritty, poignant and beautiful; a special movie that will always hold a special part in my heart. It still holds up and I encourage everyone to see it. It was an example of the kind of movies we enjoyed before political correctness dumbed and watered all film expression down."
3,"Decent, Gritty 70s Police Movie","I liked the fact that this movie was filmed on location. It was the beautiful 70s New York from the movies I remember as a kid.The story was fine, the action was good. The plot moved along a bit slowly and Anthony Quinn's character was a bit over the top.I love Yaphet Koto and it was great seeing him however I wish he said more in the movie. He was pretty quiet.This film should appear on any list of good 70s crime movies, but its not in the same league as 7Ups, Bullit, French Connection, The Hot Rock, etc."
3,ever comming to dvd ?,this and others like 3 the hard way the black samuri and others .should come to the dvd world with of course extra footage and behind the scene making off the films.im still waiting /across 110th st.should be first thanks carlos
3,Great Soundtrack,"The best thing about Across 110th Street is the music with Bobby Womack and J.J. Johnson teaming up on the excellent soundtrack. The movie has a decent feel to it as far as cop dramas went during that time, but there were much better movies such as Gordon Parks' Shaft and Norman Jewison's In the Heat of the Night. Still, it is fun to watch if for nothing more than Yaphet Kotto, who would later play the precinct captain in Homicide, a long way from the blaxploitation films of the 70's."
3,lacking movie,"this movie has a nice story but lacks action. It starts out with it, then the action declines."
2,My opinion,I bought this item to try the quality of it in my line of work thats why i don't like them. They tear easily and not chemically resistant
1,not very good,I never received them and the seller asked me recind my comment and he would return my $$ but never did. Find another merchant!
4,When is Hasburgh's next book coming out?,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. As someone who lives outside of the unbelievably rich areas of Colorado, it's always fun to see what these places are really like (and yes to have some prejudices confirmed). I hope this won't be Hasburgh's only foray into fiction - finding out what happens next to Jake and the love of his life Annie would be great fun to read."
4,A double black diamond mogul run,"As ""Aspen Estreme"" is a movie for skiers, so is this book. It's a wild ride.A great book to take on a Ski vacation."
1,"How about ""0"" stars?","What can I say. This is the only software I ever intalled that generated the ""blue screen of death"" on my Windows XP computer. This software is NOT compatible with Windows XP as far as I can tell. I tried everything I could think of to try to install the first disk including a variety of settings under XP's Compatibility Mode (Win95, '98, 256 colors, etc.). Error messages each time. I linked to the company's web site and the product is no longer listed as far as I can see. The one page documentation indicated that I needed to visit other web site for support and there is little information on those sites that help.Basically - this software is not recommended!"
4,Solid,"These guys definitely wear their influences on their sleeves. I can hear Meshuggah and Dillinger all over this record. The cool thing is that they take that inspiration and spin it their own way. There's not a dull moment on this record, and (unlike most ""Math"" metal) the songs are so convoluted and schizophrenic that multiple listens don't dilute how technical this stuff is.The vocals are truly used like an instrument in this band, and I've never really heard it done in this manner. They also do some REALLY cool stuff with tempo changes and soft/loud dynamics. I'm definitely impressed. I'm looking forward to more from these guys.Every song has at least one or two parts that will leave you going ""WTF?"""
4,pretty good,"rarely ever does relapse sign a band without that band having been signed to a record label already. that being said, should prove this band has some talent. And that they do.this album has some really sick parts to it, really nice riffs, vocals, and mathy feel to it. it does however lack in a few songs that has some pretty unexciting parts but usually the song will redeem itself. recommended if you're into tech metal."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"Another week, another redundant tech-metalcore album from Replapse. How many bands have these guys signed now that sound exactly the same? The same aimlessly busy structures, the same playing techniques they all learnt in grind academy and keep regurgitating in the same rudimentary ways, the same unironic badassery fueling it. Keep churning them off the assembly line, I'll just sit here twiddling my thumbs waiting for the new Will Haven album to knock this whole trend-genre back into the stone age. I recommend picking up Ashley Tisdale's new album Headstrong instead of this."
2,Eh..,I was so excited about getting a coin purse. Especially one that was handmade. I'm upset because I received a plain old black and white one which wasn't even in the picture. It also felt a little weird because I'm black. Also I can't ever seem to get this thing open. I try extremely hard and it takes me about 12 tried to open it. It would really help if they let you atleast describe what you want like say you want it colorful or not plain or something like that.
1,"Not the ""real thing"".","I was very disappointed when I received one of these new SuperBalls: the original had a recovery of 90-92% (it would bounce back 9/10ths of the way!). It used an extremely strong compression process during manufacturing and it felt very heavy and dense for its size. In addition, the surface was peculiar, in that it would not slip at all, even when sliding it over a very slick surface, but would adhere to it in a very uncanny way. The new ""SuperBall"" is a very poor imitation: its bounce recovery is more like 60% and it is inferior even to a cheap transparent high bounce ball that I got as a freebie... It feels light and bears no relationship to the original...Sorry, but this ball does not qualify as ""the real thing""."
2,Very disappointing,"I had high expectations for this ball after researching it online/reading reviews, but it was a sore disappointment. Maybe it's just my opinion, but I think standard $.50 bouncy balls can bounce higher than this one...and they cost 1/10th as much if you include shipping. Sad."
3,Bit of a let down,"One of the more disappointing Booker prize winners. Ploughs through the slave trade with its the attendant moral dilemas, but this is a vein that has been mined in minute detail in numerous works of fiction for more than a century, thus nothing new here. The shifting-scene decvice is a bit played and try as he might, the author's characters rarely break stereotype. A slog in the true literary sense for no apparent reward - other than giving the author an invitation to write a sequel. Give this one a miss and try Julian Barnes' ""A Sense of an Ending"" or Banville's ""The Sea,"" both worthy standard bearers for the prize."
3,Fflawed but worth reading,"I read this because it won, with The English Patient, the Booker prize for 1992. Some parts were boring. All the detail about practicing a play seemed pointless to me, and at the end the pidgin English really turned me off because there was so much of it. I was curious about the end, and decided that the end was neither unsatisfactory nor totally satisfactory. I feel my time could have been better spent."
3,Moderate Novel,"Barry Unsworth's Sacred Hunger, is a moderately written novel about a ship during the slave trade. Unswort's novel has too much description which makes it hard to read. He switches scenes almost every other chapter,and the chapters are hard to connect together. The novel does not start to get really interesting until well in the to 400's. When it does get interesting though, the reader will not want to put the book down. This book is definately for someone interested in history, as it takes place in the 1700's during the slave trade. Overall, I'd rate this book a 3 as the ending was really good, but the beginning was just not good."
1,sacred hunger,"One of the most difficult, slow and overly detailed booksi have ever read. Not at all worth the time."
5,Must read.,Started a little slowly but built to a wonderful novel. I would recommend this book as both historically instructive and a moving and very well written novel. It is abook that once finished requires a decompression time to sit and contemplate.
5,Hunger Satisfied,"""Sacred Hunger"" transports readers to Eighteenth Century England, Africa and south Florida as Barry Unsworth examines and traces the English slave trade and the ""sacred hunger"" for power, money and satisfaction of the men who practised that trade. With careful detail, Unsworth bares the superstitions, dreams, determination and callousness of a time of unbridled capitalism, and also of the fate of one experiment in a utopia."
3,Romance and Mystery,"Chad Foster is a tv personality, who has been targeted with some ""fan mail"" that points to a possible stalker situation. Jenna Wakefield works for the police department, and it's her job to protect him. From here, the story develops. The mystery develops as the reader (and the two main characters) tries to figure out WHO is stalking Chad Foster? I always find it fun to figure out these ""whodunnits""... always makes a romance novel a bit more spicy."
2,Lost my European vacation,"Out of 6 Memorex discs used on my European vacation, only 3 were abled to playback. All 6 were stored and carried the same way, together. I've not had one Sony disc fail. Suggest that only Sony discs be used in Sony products."
3,Late-60's Pop Romp,"Enoch Light has a well-deserved reputation as both an accomplished musician AND a pioneering technical recording engineer. That said, SPACED OUT is a pleasant-if-not-outstanding album from around 1970 (judging by the songs). The material is great: ""Bond Street"", ""Lovers' Concerto"", ""Walk On By"", ""A Little Fugue For You And Me"" and no less than 4 Beatles tunes: ""Eleanor Rigby"", ""Norwegian Wood"", ""Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da"" and ""Get Back"". No complaints, but of all the Enoch Light albums I've heard this was the one that impressed me the LEAST. Sound quality on the CD is excellent. I noticed 2 of the Beatles' songs had also appeared on Light's BEATLES CLASSICS album, but-- SURPRISE! These aren't the same recordings. (Actually I liked the other versions better.) Faint praise, but there you go. I DO highly recommend Light's BIG BAND material, as well as PERSUASIVE PERCUSSION (stunning! ) and BEATLES CLASSICS (if you can find it)."
5,Grandma & Me at the Beach,Someone purchased this cd by Mercer Mayer for me. My grandson who is 3 years old today just loves this story. He also enjoys the stickers and playing in the sand. I have looked all over the place for other cds by Mercer Mayer along the same line. Everyone seems to have heard of them but do not know where to purchase them. Could you help me with this. How many cds does Mercer Mayer have besides Grandma & Me at the beach and Just me and my Dad.
2,bug-ridden but otherwise OK,"I'm amazed to see so many positive reviews. We've tried this on at least two computers, under Windows 98 and 98 SE, and it crashed a lot on both of them. On our current Win 98 SE computer, it crashes once per page at least, making the program effectively unusable. Sadly no patch is available.As another reviewer points out, it doesn't autoplay when you insert the disk."
1,Just Me and My Dad,This item is rated for 3-7 years old. However with this age group it does not automatically run when placed in the CD Drive. This make it impossible for the younger this age group is to use on their own. It seems an auto run command should be used on software used for children to provide them with hassle free use of the product.If it does't run what use is it no matter who the writer is. I have Windows 2000.
4,A Duo of Trios,"""The Red Norvo Trios"" is another OOP Prestige CD that I picked up recently at Newbury Comics. It features music the vibist recorded with two different trios between 1953 and 1955, both with bassist Red Mitchell. The disc's first fifteen tracks feature guitarist Jimmy Raney, but unfortunately seven of those songs also appear onRed Norvo Trio, omitting ""Puby La Keg"" from the original album due to time constraints. Only the remaining four tracks are with guitarist Tal Farlow, which along with tracks 1-8 (with Raney) originally comprised the Fantasy LP ""The Red Norvo Trios."" The sound isn't great, but it is clearer than it would have been with a drummer in the mono mix. Overall, there is more music here so get this instead of the OJC CD."
5,"For people who might resist, listen to this classic","This is a classic and wonderful recording. Some of the songs, for my taste, might come close to ""schlock"" value, but the absolutely stunning singing and creative, subtle, soulful musical arrangements soar each number, starting, of course, with the great title number. For all musical tastes, and for the ages."
5,An angel anytime of the day,"Merrilee Rush truly had an angelic voice; her brief 15 minutes of fame culminating with the hit 'Angel of the Morning', yet this song has stood the test of time: classic radio stations today still play this tune daily. The CD of the same name lists a who's-who of writing talent helping her: Chip Taylor, John Phillips, Joe South, Mark Lindsey among others. Although many of the CD tracks are covers, it is still a fun-loving CD which will catapult the listener back to a simpler time when talent mattered and hope prevailed."
3,"Not bad, but Berne has better albums.","With the line up I really had high expectations. If you're new to Tim Berne I highly recommend starting out with ""Fractured Fairy Tales,"" or ""The Shell Game."" If you can find ""Science Friction"" - that's a great release too ...Also be on the look out for the winter & winter release called Big Satan featuring Berne, Marc Ducret, and Tom Rainey. Now go out there and buy some CD's!!!"
1,disappointed !,"a very disappointed old book ! a book from the seventies! very few pictures, many boards for american countries. Solar means, for me, interest for nature and for health. technical solutions suggested are not for health ! technik will kill us. let's us go to more simplicity !"
4,"It works, but not for smaller pipes","While the instructions imply that it might work for smaller pipes, I found it tough to get a grip as I got close to the 1.5 inch range. For larger stuff, it should get the job done great.If you think you can get by with the 6"", go with that one. You'd be surprised how long a 12"" handle can seem."
2,Doesn't hold up,"Gotta say, For this kind of money, and when I buy a klein, I expect a lot better. Just broke today. Now this is maybe 20 years old but heh, I'm a reluctant diy'er, homeowner and I can easily go thru a year not using it at all. Other years, maybe 4-5 times at most. So there is a metal plate on each side of strap head that holds it on. On one side the plate is simply secured with minimally peened heads on a round rod, so of course, as any idiot can see if looking at it, the peening will wear away. When you do need a strap wrench, you really need one, so i'm very unhappy with Klein. Made back when stuff was supposed to be better also. USA made. God knows what they are like now. Perhaps can do a funky jury rig on it somehow."
3,"Not as good as expected, also check out Rigid.","Tool is tough, built like any other klein - but the strap is less grippy than expected, and the cam buckle that attaches it to can mar surfaces if you're not careful. Granted, the application that I really needed this tool was narrow and had protruding surfaces nearby."
4,Action packed...,"The movie has passion, it has action, it has suspense, it has comedy, and it has unity. Although, I felt in the beginning the ""four brothers"" over did the notion they were brothers, the outcome of the movie was great.There are a lot of twists to this movie. The brothers use their street smarts to invoke their brand of street justice to avenge the murder of their mother.John Singleton was able to take the audience through their pain individually for how it was for them to lose someone they loved dearly, who had taken these unruly children into her home and made them her own. As a viewer, I was able to feel their emotional strides of wanting to get the bad guy Victor Sweet at all costs"
3,Some moral conflict,"Four Brothers is definitely not a movie that kids under thirteen should see. It is pretty intense and has a high body count. It also has some moral conflict because the moral is this: If someone you love is killed, it is okay to kill tons of people in revenge. Now, this moral is not true, this movie is just for entertainment.The story: Four adopted brothers, 2 white guys and 2 african american guys, are reunited after the death of their mom, Evelyn Mercer. Together they hunt down the killer.When their mom was first killed, I had expected them to handle it professionally but instead, they just go around threatening people and killing them. That is not the right way to handle it. Anyway, this movie is action-packed and suspensful."
1,The Worst Film that I have seen in about 5 Years!,"This movie was about as painful to watch as the revenge exacted by the brothers in this movie on the killers of their ""mother.""An old woman is gunned down during a robbery and it turns out she was a type of social worker that had taken in four troubled youths and raised them as her sons. The sons vow to find and kill the ones who did this. They later find out that it was not a simple robbery but that that their mother was followed and executed.The movie is full of senseless violence and makes Detroit look like a state of anarchy. Sofia Vergara has a stereotypical role as a dumb Latin lover of one of the four brother which looks like a role that will be a career killer for her.The ending is fairly predictable and the movie's plot and stupid dialogue often is an insult to anyone's intelligence. Maybe Mark Wohlers should abandon his acting career and go back to rapping!"
1,Don't bother on this one.,"Wow, what a terrible movie. I even suffered through the entire thing hoping it would get better. Bad story, bad acting, bad movie.Probably the most unrealistic movie that I've ever seen. There are about half a dozen shooting scenes in which no cops ever show up. Marky Mark turns out to be a super-tough guy who seems to make his own rules in gangster-ridden Detroit. Him and his brothers wouldn't last ten seconds toting guns throughout D-town.Seriously don't waste your time."
1,Pure trash.,"This was a terrible movie. The acting in this movie was some of the worst I have seen in an extremely long time. The dialogue is hackneyed, trite, and predictable. The characters were shallow, uninteresting, and dull. I did not have any emotional interest in any of the characters. I fast-forwarded through most of the movie and I was still able to get the gist of it. None of the dialogue is meaningful. When you are watching it, you can tell that you are watching a poorly made docu-drama--intended to be violent -- pop pop pop -- with no intelligible principle behind the theme of the story. Don't buy this junk."
3,Four Brothers minus which one ?,"Bound by love for their slain adoptive mother, the brothers in Four Brothers form a unique quartet that gives John Singleton's film a razor's edge of redemption.When a saintly foster mother (Fionnula Flanagan) is gunned down in a convenience store, her only adopted sons (two white, two black, played respectively by Mark Wahlberg, Garrett Hedlund, Tyrese Gibson and Andre Benjamin) go after the killers, only to discover that their mother's death was not a random event. As they uncover a sticky web of criminal activity involving a local kingpin (Chiwitel Ejiofor), the character-driven plot races toward an inevitable showdown, with ex-con Wahlberg leading the way. Making excellent use of blue collar locations in Detroit, Singleton keeps the action moving fast.I rate it 3 out of 5."
1,OK....NO,"This movie is a rough draft. It's as if John Singleton saw the rough draft of a movie with potential not knowing it wasn't finished and shot the movie. Given time to develop the story and add some depth to the characters it could have been a really good movie. Does it make the directors and actors money to be in such bad movies cause so many are made and released? Are these movies not being previewed before they are actually released? Are these movies shot with more details and durning editing they are so chopped up that they make no sense? What is going on I mean really reading this as a script had to have not made sense so why was it even made? If you just want a night of eye candy with no substance rent this movie. If you are looking for a well made, well crafted movie don't waste your time on this one. This is strictly an eye candy movie."
5,this movie deserves more than 5 stars!,"anyone who gave this movie less than 5 stars is freakin psycho. this movie practically had me bursting with tears. it was SOOOO sad. this is totally my new favorite movie. this move is way better than sky high, fantastic four, war of the worlds, the incredibles, and every other movie i reviewed on multiplied by ten. if you want a movie that will have you crying and will have you talking about it for ages, go see this one. i not only promise, but i SWEAR that you will love it. i found out about this movie from my friend brittany, so i decided to go see it because she said it rocked. seriousley, this movie wasn't what i expected. it was WAY WAY better. get your but off your computer right now, and run to the nearest theater. if you don't have enough money, sneak your way in(just kidding)."
2,Yikes,"The acting in this movie is terrible. The only mentionable performance is by Terrence Howard and he's not in much of the movie anyway. Andre 3000 does okay, but the rest of the characters are just awful and hard to identify with. The first half of the movie drags but there is some decent action later on if you can stay awake long enough. I just can't think of anything that I really enjoyed about this one."
3,falls short on credibility,"The premise of this film is good: four adoptive bothers meet to unravel and then seek revenge for a seemingly meaningless killing in a rough urban scene. The actors are also very good, starting with Wahlberg, who carries an entire environment in the roles he chooses. Unfortunately, as the story unfolds, I felt that it became almost comicbook-like in the way that it cut corners: there is rampaging violence with little consequence, like even taking suspects into the police station for questioning (except when it advances the plot); the characters slowly lose credibility as they take smarter and smarter actions; and the ending has not one but two deus ex machina devices that ruin the remaining realism.What the film becomes is a kind of shoot'em up cowboy movie, with an icing of realism implied. At that, it isn't too bad, but it is entertainment when it could have been a much much finer film. Not recommended."
3,"An Urban ""Who-Done-It?"" Tale!","When four brothers go home to Detroit to bury their deceased foster mother, they find out her death was no accident. They then search for the truth and bring the perpetrators to justice. Director John Singleton brings together some high class talent to make this film work. Mark Wahlberg, Garrett Hedlund, Tyrese Gibson and Andre Benjamin playing the brothers gives the movie substance. They work together nicely as a unit. Oscar nominee Terrance Howard gives a strong preformance in a supporting role as the police detective searching for clues. The action sequences are stellar. However, it does fall flat at times with the dialogue and plot. Overall, its a good action film that I would recommend."
5,loved it,It was very good had a lot of action in it.Some of the shots were done in Detroit. Most of them were in Canada. The lake scene was done on lake Ontario.
2,"Not a good movie, but Amazon streaming quality worse","It was necessary for us to finish watching this movie on Netflix from the Roku because the quality of Amazon streaming is terrible - the movie was interrupted continuously to buffer. This is not my internet speed - I test the speed often, and this does not happen on other applications I use on my Roku.As for the movie, there really isn't much good to say. The acting was poor -- characters are developed poorly, so it is difficult to care about them."
3,"Good Movie, somewhat cliched","It's not a bad movie, the acting was good, but just felt the plot line was rather cliche and not very unique. There were some twists in the movie that kept it interesting though, so overall I'd say it's worth a watch!"
1,Twist on a buddy movie,"Violent convenience store hold up - the mother of four adopted black and white ""brothers"" killed , snow, Detroit, shotguns, macho and formulaic."
3,Four Brother,"The Four Brothers crime Drama was the typical shoot and car chase movie that we've all become so accustomed to watching. It doesn't have much of a plot that you can't guess and the characters are unbelievable. I felt like I saw this same movie a hundred times before and the only difference is that this one was supposed to be set in Detroit (although it seems that the director had no idea what detroit is like). The shooting and car chase scenes were great but I'm from Detroit and the whole vibe of the movie just wasn't Detroit. The crime here is alot grimier, the streets look different, we talk different, and most importantly we don't play any type of hockey (come on now,it's a million black people). I think it's worth watching if you can ignore the inaccuracies of the writers and directors."
1,Reallly Really Really BAD!!!,"My gosh this movie was bad!! I knew from the first 10 minutes this movie was horible I should have walked out when I could have gotten a refund, the acting was horible the plot was so unrealistic and rediculous it was like a 10 year old wrote this script without any concept of reality.About 30 min into this movie it seemed as if this movie turned into a comedy because nothing could be taken seriously.I was especially astonished when 4 loser brothers walk into a high school wave a gun around in the middle of a crowded gym, knock a guy in the face but some how walk out of the gym untouched, not arested or even questioned. How's that fow a great plot.TERRIBLE MOVIE!!! Don't evenm watch it if it's free, it's not even worth the bootleg!"
2,Average at best,"While the movie was entertaining it lacked any depth. They must have said ""this is my brother"" 20 times. the story was unrealistic and weak. That being said, considering what else there was to choose from this summer this movie was watchable."
1,Never recieved my item!!!,"My review is very negative considering I purchased my movie, and never received it. Not only that but wrote two sincere emails to the seller and no response, and no movie. I will never buy from this seller again!"
1,The calapse of Hollywood is near.,"I guess in the age of NO talent movie stars, writters that love violence and Hollywood being a distructive force for morality this movie doesn't surprise me. Nor will it surprise you. It's Hollywood telling the same old story over and over again but each time with a little more violence. As most educated people know this kind of thing just shows the rest of the world what kind of people we really are. They see everything from the eyes of the media and Hollywood. I wait for the fall of Hollywood. The talent just doesn't exist anymore. The time of good Hollywood stars, music scores, writers, directors, costume designers and now a thing of the past. Save yourself money and not go which would be the political correct thing to do as far as i'm concerned."
1,sucks,I remember seeing this in theatre and the credits came u the audience left angry and called the worst movie ever. Do not waste your time on this.
3,Shoot 'Em Up Movie,"This movie wasn't deep but it was alright to an extent. I'm sure it has put a lot of foolish notions inside of people's heads since the movie itself was a bit foolish. Walk around with some guns, beat up people, and think you can get away with it. Sofia Vergara's character as the girlfriend annoyed the he11 out of me so much that I almost turned the movie off. But whatever. I didn't have to pay for anything and it was something to watch on a boring Saturday afternoon."
1,Oh brother...,"Had a lot of potential, but played like a random collection of incoherent contrived scenes. Seems like the director went through his old idea journal and made a movie out of it. Great to see André 3000 in a movie, just wish it was done better."
2,didnt like it,"For one, the relationships between the four brothers does not come across real enough. Then on top of that there is way to much crimes being done by the foursome...in real life they would not get that far, especially in Detroit! This movie fails in my eyes because it does not explore the characters and the relationships they had with the adoptive mother on a real solid level. We see so much of the city of Detroit it makes us hope we never live there, and in the end it again, just has to much hollywood and not enough realism to make it worthwhile. I want my 2 hours back!"
2,Waste of time,"I got this film because I'm from Detroit where this takes place. It's a pretty typical revenge flick. Four brothers want to find their adoptive mother's killer. Usual smartass remarks, guys talking BS, fights, shootouts, blah, blah, blah. I guess these kind of movies will always be made and when made well they can be fun to watch. This script was mediocre at best. Give me a Clint Eastwood or Bruce Willis film any day over this tripe."
4,Modern Western well done.,"Four Brothers is dubbed an ""Urban Western"" in one of the special features on the DVD. The filmmakers hit the 'Western' imagery right on the head. With vigilante justice and unlikely bonds, the stuff of old-time Westerns, the film comes alive as brothers seek revenge after the slaying of their mother. Plot twists and action will hold your attention. Some portions of the film are a bit unreal, but that's so in every Western I've ever seen. In the beginning, it's hard, as a viewer, to apply the 'Western' style to a hard urban community. For me, the relationships seemed a little awkward in this style. But the angle is a brave and successful move for the writers, director and producer. The acting is also superb. All four 'brothers' bring something special to the cinematic table."
5,Detroit city,well this movie is a smash hit in my house! i have two brother (by blood) we grew up in Detroit! it is a very hard place to grow up and even now compared to the 80's and 90's from when we were there it has gotten worse.i bought this on amazon to instant stream because i had to watch a movie that dealt with criminal behavior and deviant acts for a criminology class. this movie was perfect for that assignment.
2,Four Brothers [Blu-ray],This is one of my favorite movies. I was very excited to find it on Blu-ray for such a great price. It came in the mail just a few days after ordering. The only negative thing I can say is that the sound quality is poor. I guess you get what you pay for...$9.99
5,Wake Up!,"I don't know what's wrong with some of you people, but this movie was GREAT! I am not going to go into the summary and all because most people already did that with their reviews, but the problem solving abilities of these characters was outstanding. To the person that said rent it first, you must be kidding. This is DEFINITELY one to add to your collection. Usually John Singleton's movies have a slow beginning then a climax towards the end, but he really out did himself on this one."
3,An Okay Movie,"Like others have mentioned before, this movie is unrealistic and defintely unoriginal. There are much better movies about loved ones seeking revenge. What really held this movie back was the acting. At no point in time did I feel any emotional attachment to any of the characters. Despite all of its flaws, the movie was entertaining. I don't view it as a serious movie with any type of deeper meaning or message. It is just one of those movies to watch and see what off-the-wall antics the emotionally scarred brothers are going to come up with next. I gave this movie three stars because it is watchable, and I can see how some may find it really enjoyable. I thought it was just an okay movie with no real substance."
3,FOUR BROTHERS-shine,"while this is an imperfect movie and BAD things do happen to nice people. FOUR BROTHERS is a family worth getting to know. you may not actually get REAL history with them but you do come to care about them. woman takes in the young orphans teaching them social, family and moral values. you would think their upbringing would make them want to do the correct thing, but remember its their adopted mother. mother dies and the 4 brothers look into it. FANTASTIC MUSIC and brothers passion for finding the truth help make this standard revenge flick worth seeing. director JOHN SINGLETON is a master of this style of film. FOUR BROTHERS may not be great but you definitly want to see the brothers work together to salvage a mother's reputation of good."
4,Great movie and quality.,I have no complaints. The quality of the dvd was great and the timing was excellent. I actually received much sooner than expected. Thanks!
2,Terrible acting!,"Weird plot, bad acting. I could not keep watching it in its whole, but I felt that I saw enough to just turn it off."
3,3 Lads,"I thought it was a good story line but, lacked the visual. A disappointing ending made the video another cheep one night stand with no emotion displayed by the foreigners."
2,Okay,wasn't bad for a short. The acting was ok. I'm giving it two stars because it could have been a little longer.
4,"Nice, interesting",Wish it was long and developed the story more. The girlfriend was a bad actor and only had one note.
2,Cute but hardly worth it,"cute and clever, but really? this is not a movie. should be a freebie on youtube and not something one buys from amazon."
1,This is the stereotype of independent film.,"This short's been done dozens of times before as a movie, a play, o short story, a novel, fan fiction, and porn. The biggest problems with this are not that it's all trope and no originality, though. The biggest problems are the acting, storytelling, and cinematography. This should not be sold. This is the kind of thing you put on DVD extras with a disclaimer when you've released a good movie. The camera is jerky. The lighting is terrible. The mic must have been hidden in someone's pants. The 'plot' gets moved along via phone call at the start (as in the trailer) not once but twice. There's maybe one good shot of the characters. The best you can say is that Billy Ray Gallion is pretty. If you're a 'Lost' completist, you might want to watch. Otherwise, skip it."
5,Great gay independent film,"Recent reviews:""wow, very touching, to bad not all men are that sensitive to their feelings and open minded & secure with themselves to even go there""""A really nice little flick. Props to y'all!""""I liked this it was sweet and awesome.""AMAZING!!!!""""Brilliant bit of artwork that.""Please support independent cinema. Thank you!"
1,"3 Lads, An American Fool and One Night","A really senseless piece of work. The story lacked any meaning or focus. Of course, being a ""director's cut"" I didn't expect there would be much time for character development. But even at that it was a disappointment. The acting was mundane."
1,Don't bother.,"I isn't bother with this one. It's very short and at the I said ""huh, what was that about"". I wouldn't waste your money r time,"
5,Sony BPT23 Phone battery,"We received the battery within a very reasonable time frame, it charged well and has been trouble free since. Thanks for making this available. The Phone manufacturer said it was discontinued but we love the phone and are happy to be able to continue it's use."
1,Wrong Product,"I sent a letter on Aug 15,2005 to Batteries Guy at 264 Hewes St, Brooklyn New York (the return address on the shipping envelope) asking them to please ship the correct item and some information on returning the battery that did not fit my phone. I have not yet received a reply. There was no phone number or e-mail address in the package."
5,WC95760,"Although the picture does not match, the item is EXACTLY what I wanted. The Ford dealer wanted $150.00 for this cable, plus had to order it. This is the OEM positive and negative battery cable assembly/harness and has the Ford tape on it. I tried buying the same item online elsewhere and after being told the item was in stock, I received an e-mail stating the item ""Just went out of stock"" soon after receiving my payment. I am now escalating the issue with PayPal to receive a refund. Live and learn. Next time I'll go to Amazon.com first. Thanks for providing what you promised."
5,Exactly what I needed!,Quickly delivered and exactly what I needed. Wrong picture on the product description but that's understandable considering the thousands of car parts available. Great buy!
5,STOP THE WHINING...,"This box set is exactly what it says it is: the classic albums remastered with the latest technology. The sound is incredible and the packaging is beautifully done. If you want to hear the Doors in their most pristine form, buy this box. If you don't care about sound quality that much, don't buy it. But stop the whining about the price, the fact that the albums were once remastered, that the Doors sans Morrison had 2 other albums (like anybody ever cared about them), etc. etc. I for one love remastered music and am willing to pay for it. And the Doors effort is tremendous."
3,What were they thinking?,"Am I the only one who is a bit confused by the title of this collection? If this is supposed to be the Complete STUDIO recordings, why is there a bonus disc entitled ""Best of the '97 Box Set"" which contains LIVE recordings? And why are some STUDIO recordings from that collection, (e.g., ""Rock is Dead"") not included? Not to mention all the other compliants already posted (where are the outtakes, alternate versions, post-Morrison albums, and especially ""An American Prayer"")? And another thing, the faithful reproduction of the record albums with the paper sleeves only serves to remind me how annoying and fragile those paper sleeves were."
3,Not Complete Recordings!,"Without the remaining two Doors albums on this collection I would hardly call this COMPLETE! Granted, Morrison was a legend and one of the greatest writers and lead singers in the history of Rock music, but without the fine backing and input from the other members, I doubt he would be anywhere at all. Simply put, Other Voices and Full Circle, the final two Doors albums should have been included. I think most Doors fans would agree. I know I've waited a long time to see this happen."
5,Doors complete studio recordings( box set),"A living legacy of the greatest American rock'n roll band,thru these recordings their legacy will endure the test of time."
1,disappointed,"It is disappointing to see the fifth release of material on CD that has already been released on CD. It could have been made very much better. I am very disappointed, it seems the New Doors (as everybody should call them) are only in in for the myth and for the money."
5,"A winner, 11 on a scale of 1 to 10","The new box set is a real winner. The 24 bit remastered sound is great. However, for old timers like me, one of the best things about it is the packaging. The CDs are packaged like mini-LPs with the original labels and dust liners. Highly recommend."
5,Stop nit-picking. This is The Doors!,"A purchaser of this box gets the six classic Doors studio albums with an incredible remastered sound plus a seventh disc with some excellent live tracks and some interesting studio outtakes. It also contains a worthwhile booklet with some interesting commentary on the albums. All the discs are in facsimile cardboard sleeves, which is a nice touch. The cost is less than $13 per disc. People can buy whatever they like -- the individual albums, the Bright Midnight live releases (recommended), the earlier box set of unreleased material (which the seventh disk on this box summarizes), greatest hits packages, etc. -- but there's really no justification for saying that this particular box rates less than five stars if you're a Doors fan. I've been waiting for this box for a long time, and I'm really pleased to have it."
4,From a Curious Listener,"The problem with this box set is obviously the price. That is, if you're not a true Doors fan, you're probably going to feel you've been ripped off. As all the other reviews point out, the clarity and sound is unbelievably crisp. Example: Horse Lattidudes. I really disliked the additional vocals that they put in on Break on Through--""she gets high"". It sounds really goofy. They should have left it alone, as history had intended it to be, ""she get. . ."" If you just like lisenting to the hits, like me, then save your money. I like the Doors, but I'm not a true fan. I think their music has a sense of madness that's unresistable, especially lyrically. For all that money, anyway, it's still pretty damn awesome."
2,Doors Box Set A Big Disappointment,"I consider the seven disk Doors box set a big disappointment. Upon examining the contents, I realized it was merely a rehash of the previous Doors box set and other stuff they released. I'm not impressed with their ""remastering"" of the six Doors albums. I expected,as most Doors fans did, the release of material in their archives that formerly appeared only on bootlegs. What became of Paris Blues? for instance. Additionally, there is an abundance of other Doors songs that rightfully should have appeared on this box set.I tend to agree with the commentator who angrily suspected that greed is the prime factor in the release of this ghastly, overpriced box set. I maintain that this box set is a repetition and a waste of money for anyone but a recent convert to the Doors magic. After visiting Jim's grave in Paris this year and devouring all the literature available on the Doors, I feel terribly disappointed by this box set."
3,Some songs are slightly different.....,"Does anybody know why there are differences between the original studio versions than these? I noticed right off the bat that ""The End"" during the big jam toward the end has banter from Morrison that was not on the original release. If you go back to first pressing on vinyl it's not there either. Off ""Waiting for the Sun"" ""Wintertime Love"" is a different version too. That is the only negative for me with this box set, otherwise the sound quality and artwork are great."
4,Skunked again,"I liked the remastering but I was really disappointed they remixed ""Break on Through"" so that the bridge reverts to it's original state. The original recording has Jim saying ""she get....HIGH!!!!"" but we were used to hearing ""she get!!!"" because of censorship concerns when this song was originally released. I think it helped the recording and I would have preferred the original mix remastered and that is what I thought I was buying."""""
3,Not Complete...But Otherwise Good,"What I mean by not complete: the collection is missing 3 songs -""Five to One"" (4:22), ""(You Need Meat) Don't Go No Further"" (3:37), and ""Horse Latitudes"" (1:30). Sure, you might have never heard of these songs, but they exist, on the album ""Weird Scenes Inside the Gold Mine"" (1972), which was never released on CD. The fact that these songs are not in the box set makes it seem like the box set should be called ""The ALLMOST Complete Box Set""-- if the collection is entiled ...""Complete""... than it should be, and not be missing 3 songs. Terrible. Otherwise, the sound is great and these songs have never sounded better, and probally never will."
4,An unusual presentation of facts about our history vis a vis native Americans and newcomers.,"I bought this book because it was written by a writer new to me. Recently I read "" The Girl I Left Behind"". I was so impressed by that book; I Googled the writer.Then, ordered her other books. ""Native American History"" is set up in a very unusual format, which may prove difficult for readers of novels or historical fiction, or even history.My family members are lined up behind me, waiting their turns to study this publication.This Spring I had read ""Caleb's Crossing"" and was fascinated by the historical references in a work of fiction, especially because only recently some local Native American language from Massachusetts has been translated by a young woman. I live in south central Mass. Within the ""Bay Path"", a route traversed by several native American groups.This adds another perspective to my interest."
5,A Real Wake-Up Call,"A friend of mine had recommended this book... I found I couldn't put the book down. The awakening exercises in the book grabbed me... this book gave me a way to take that thought and turn it into a positive force in my daily life. The different chapters and exercises on loving ourselves, others, and life and finding meaning gave me ways todo things differently so my days seem richer. I find I'm not taking each day for granted like before. For that reason alone, the book has been a valuable read and I've heartily recommended to my friends and family."
2,Simply couldn't finish it...,"I am one of GGM's big fans. However, for some reason I found this book extemely difficult to read. Too much magical realism, if you ask me. I gave it quite a few shots and failed miserably.I recommend that before you bite into this one, you read some other books of his."
3,The Neverending Poem,"This is a good book, don't get me wrong. And I will only speak for the English/translated version. It's a classic in fact, not just going by the author who is a brilliant man. A classic in terms of experimental writing. A first: something so original you will always remember forcing yourself through this difficult to read material. There are times where I read the same page three times, just to get the story line right. From that perspective it's timeless just as the book itself. But after a while you get the feeling as if Gabriel is toying with you. Torn between loving the old man, hating his guts, cursing his second wife, saluting his victory over himself. Anyone with any ambitions for power should read this. It's Machiavellian theme, its hidden storyline, its wonderful depictions of real and everyday life... so real, too real perhaps. But not for your everyday, easy reading pleasures. You really need to take time off to enjoy this. Sorry,"
4,A very important work,"I can't say that ""Autumn of the Patriarch"" fits into the mould of novel writing. It is, however, an examination of a despot and the wreck of his poisoned kingdom. Filled with black humour and grotesque images, it pulls the reader forward in spite of the endless sentences. One can almost see the squalor and smell the rubbish in the city. I would hesitate to compare it to anything else that Marquez has written because it is so different but what it does have is Marquez profound insight into the ways and failings of mortals."
2,Boring and predictable,"I like García Márquez's literature. Three of his books are among my favorites. But this one I didn't like. I must say that I usually prefer demanding readings over ""light"" literature, so it's not the ""stream-of-consciousness"" what bored me (I love ""Ulysses"", for example). But I did not find it interesting. 50 pages-long sentences must be really excellently crafted. I think in this work they are not. Perhaps for non-Latin Americans it is a wonderful tale about a bizarre Latin American dictator and the savage world over which he reins. But I knew right from the start that this would be a long mock and attack on dictatorships (which is perfectly fine), and I didn't want to read more. No problem, even the best artists are entitled to some bad results."
2,Made a long trip longer,"This was the wrong book to select for a road trip even thoughI loved two of his other books, and felt up to the challenge, even so was not able to handle the tediousness of the story of a failing dictator, nevertheless, its cruel images haunt my thoughts even weeks later, and if you think this sentence is run on, you won't appreciate Marquez's style which dominates and therefore diminishes the underlying brilliance of the story."
1,"Maybe if I restructure it, I will like it?","Once in a while, in my masochistic phases, I will read a book like Autumn of the Patriach. This is like much of Faulkner's writing: Chapters made up of single paragraphs, made up of single sentences. As I read, I annotated to show some natural breaks.I know others who can dive into this kind of book and really get something out of it. I guess I should give it another chance and exercise my brain a little more. But if I do get into it again, I have a strong temptation to rewrite it in the style of Ernest Hemingway.I have all of Garcia Marquez fiction and some nonfiction available in English. This is by far my least favorite."
3,Soporific,"The title of my review sufficiently sums up the novel but brevity does not constitute a review in the eyes of Amazon. As far as the novels of Marquez are concerned, I have heard it said (more than a few times) that there are three masterpieces: One Hundred Years of Solitude, Love in the Time of Cholera and Chronicle of a Death Foretold - I ignored the warning and paid the price as I laboured through 'Autumn', fighting off sleep at every page."
4,How to surf the tidal wave of this book's confusion,"Gabriel Garcia Marquez's novel, The Autumn of the Patriarch, threw me into the sea to which he constantly referred to. The frustration in the beginning gradually swept over me, just enough so that I was able to enjoy the content of the book. Placing me in the twisted world of a disillusioned government official did more than shock me. It intrigued me, forced me to consider the world outside of my own, and tossed me into the tidal wave of symbolism, metaphor, and stream-of-conscious sentence structure. I recommend this book so that you, the reader, are able to touch upon this story that shocked the literary world beyond its wildest imagination."
2,The Conduct of Life (Classic Reprint),"The book was on time and was a brand new book. The problem was the pages looked like someone was in a hurry to copy the original book and looked a little blurry, making it difficult to read. We were not happy with this purchase."
2,Not good at all.,"I read this book several years ago and am still horrified. Lizzie Simon seems to be elitist, as others have pronounced. The book is certainly self-congratulatory, and her view of Lithium as savior is certainly narrow minded. My approach is lifestyle/faith based, does that make me a ""crackpot?"" It was also embarrassing to read about her relationship with a love interest (TMI), and how she thought she was the only one who understood him. I'm just thankful my copy was from the library, not bought with my own money."
5,Detour gave us direction,"As parents of a bipolar daughter, this book has completely changed the way we view our (our daughter's and our) challenge. It is no longer a struggle with a ""difficult child,"" but a search for a medical regimen that will work for her.If you are dealing with bipolarism in a relative, friend, or yourself, you need to read this book."
2,"Interesting, yet overrated.","When searching through bookstores, on-line and physically, all I read was praise for Simon's book. What I was searching for was a book that displayed a group of young bipolar persons that I could not relate to but just maybe slightly through the pages connect with. In turn, I found slight biographies of people that all had warm, loving, wealthy, highly educated families. Although, some did not understand the illness, they were responsive to it's diagnosis. Not everyone has this response and maybe if Simon did a bit more research than a couple month road trip and considered a wider variety of people the book would have been allowed the reader to make more a connection. ..."
5,Great read....needed read,Thank you Lizzie Simon......bravery and honesty is what makes this book a must read. I simply could not put your story down and I would recommend this book to anyone. It is a touching tale and is written in such a special way.
1,Delusions of granduer,"Lizzie confuses candidness with insight. Her prose is stilted, her perspective is entirely self-congragulatory and thus narow to an extreme. I am astounded at the positive reviews this book has recieved. The only real insight it seems to offer is the extreme mania and and detatched from reality quality that Lizzie, despite her claims to be managing her very real illness, evidences on every page. My sense is that people are intruiged with this book due to the voyeuristic opportunity to access a hip young new york ivy leaguer's life. Baring all isn't really that hard, but crafting an insightful and well-written book should still be on lizzie's to-do list."
4,Good while it lasted.,"Good for its price.Reminded me of the classic iPod earphones, in which it copied its design.However, the sound of the right earphone decreased after three months of usage and cord started to tear, revealing the copper wires underneath.This started to become an annoyance after five months of use.Anyhow, it's very good to showcase, because of its vibrant color. Though, like all earphones, these were not built to last a very long time as I could tell from its constant set of problems as the days progressed.-Peter T. (Loser!?)"
5,"Fun for all, car collectors and children alike.","I can't say enough about these cars! They are so nicely made and feel great in your hands. Small enough to carry around and big enough for little hands. Great quality, sturdy and superior look. Collectors are buying these up like hot cakes and ebay is living proof that people are willing to shell out the cash for these. Especially for the ones that are harder to find.Someone wrote a review on the Mack Truck Playset that no stores have them. They have been sold out because there has been a rush on these toys even before the movie release. Hopefully as time goes on and if they keep producing them they will be easier to come by. That's what I am hoping for. I don't have all the characters yet and would like at least one of each for my son, maybe even more for collecting."
4,Sturdy Running Shoe,I'm a biased fan of the Asics line. I believe they offer some of the more reliable and comfortable running shoes.The shoes I ordered had a nice wide toe box and are very breathable. I've run quite a bit in the 2 pairs I've purchased and have no complaints at all.
4,"Nice shoes, Nice price","I have used the shoes for a few weeks now. They are comfortable with modest support and fairly light weight. I believe the advertised weight of 10.4 oz is an understatement but the shoes are still a good value. I am training for a marathon and plan to use these for the event (in October). Right now I am primarily using a pair of Ascics 1120 Gels but plan to fully transition to these in a few weeks. The Asics 1120 offer more support and cushion, but at the price of being heavier. I don't need the additional support so the Cumulus is a better shoe for me. Hope this helps."
3,Bag's Description Incorrect,"The description of the bag (on amazon and kata-bags.com) state that the elasto-guard sleeves for the camera are in the top compartment, but mine are in the bottom compartment. I'm a little concerned that the weight of things in the top comparment could damage my dslr in the bottom compartment, especially since the LCD screen hugs the bottom of the top compartment. If you want to get an idea of what the camera compartment really looks like check out the Kata Sensitivity V backpack, as it has the camera compartment in the lower portion of the bag. Besides the surprise of the camera compartment not being where I thought it would be the bag is great. It's slightly bigger than I thought it would be. My Dell Latitude D420 fits great as does my Sony Alpha 350 with 18-70 lens attached and the extra 55-200 lens fits perfectly in the elasto-guard sleeve. There's room for a third lense as well. I'm just disappointed that the bag is not as setup as described."
4,Camera travelling backpack,"I bought this backpack to carry my camera when I travel. The area designated for the camera is secure and well padded. My complaint about the bag is it must be sized for a man with broad shoulders, it is always falling off my shoulders (unless I secure the additional buckle across my chest). The top compartment is handy but not very big. I use the secret back compartment to keep my wallet and important papers in, I can't feel them there and no one can steal them. The shoulder pads rub on your bare skin but are fine if you are wearing a long sleeved shirt. The water pouches are nice as are the cell phone & i-pod pocket. I wanted a small bag to carry my camera in and I guess this is it, it just isn't ""perfect""."
5,Best backpack I've had...ever,"This is, without a doubt, the best camera bag I've ever had...and the fact that I can also carry a small laptop is an added bonus. OK, it's not perfect if carry really long lenses, but for carrying one or (even two smallish - Nikon D40/60 are what I carry) digital SLRs with standard lenses for everyday use (mine are Nikkor 18-200 zoom and 60 mm micro) it's perfect. Lightweight, great padding, convenient, small accessory and bottle pockets."
3,Ok product,"An adequate product while it lasted. It did break on me after several months. But then again, it was cheap."
3,This has a 50% success rate,I ordered two of these because the price was good. The first one was kind of loopy. The mouse icon on the screen would shiver and randomly move on its own. The second one (so far) is much better - works like a regular mouse should.
4,mouse with roller wheel,"Just what I wanted. Roller wheel and designed for left or right hand, depending on which wrist is hurting today. Functioned plug-and-play right out-of-the-box on my toshiba laptop running XP."
2,Can not depend on this mouse,"Within one year of buying this mouse, it stopped working well. I regularly have to disconnect and reconnect it to get it working. I suspect the problem is related to the cord or USB plug.Also, within two months of buying the mouse, the buttons started sticking or jamming. I got the impression something was stuck underneath, so I contacted the company asking how to open it up or clean it out. They never replied. The problem eventually went away.It's possible the damage to the mouse was due to travelling with it--I packed it along with other electronics into suitcases (but well-cushioned) a handful of times throughout the year. But my previous mouse (ball, not optical, so it ought to be more prone to travel damage) lasted me 6 or 7 years and was packed up and moved between locations a handful of times every year as well."
1,Stopped working after 3 months,"That's what I get for going off brand. After using this mouse for about three months, it would occasionally ""lose power"" and stop working. I would be able to unplug it and plug it in and use it for a few seconds and then it would die again.If you're shopping for a mouse, don't try to save a few bucks by going off brand like I did. Spend the extra $5 and get a Microsoft or Logitech mouse. I'm still using the same $10 Logitech USB mouse that I got from Wal-Mart 7 years ago. If you want to save money in the long run, get a real mouse."
3,Good for the price,"Unit is good for the price. However, it doesn't work well unless you use a mouse pad. Even with the mouse stationary, you will see slight movement of the cursor on the screen. Useable though...."
1,Disposable mouse,"I started not to order this after reading the ""lasted 3 months"" review, but figured I would give it a shot for 5 bucks. After a month and a half of weekly laptop use Windows fails to recognize the device (on two different PCs). That adds up to about 6 uses.If you decide to give it a shot, you should be aware that this is not a full-size mouse. It's just about right for traveling with a laptop, but not so small it is difficult to use--at least until it stops working!"
1,not satisfied,"this mouse was good at first, but after about a month it stopped working. would not recommend anyone to buy this."
2,not great for fast paced use,"It works as well as any other mouse for simple daily use but when it comes to fast paced game play the mouse gets overexcited and lost. At first I thought it just took some getting used to but after using it for awhile now I can see the problem. It starts out alright but the longer you use it fast paced the more it gets ""lost"" and it's hard to aim or have it strike where your aiming."
1,DOESN'T EXIST,"I ordered this a month before Christmas for my sword-fight loving 85 year old father. It still hasn't arrived. Delay, delay and now I see it again - I REALLY DON'T THINK IT EXISTS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The ONE STAR was for keeping my hope alive"
4,"Great Charlotte, NC Band","These guys a great noirish lo-fi vibe thang going on here. Just saw them play at the Evening Muse here in Charlotte and the two guys (they are brothers: Faircloth, not Houston) play a slew of instruments simultaneously without looking or sounding like a circus act. Very groovy, bluesy slo-mo stuff with guitars, keyboards and drums an dsome electronic undercurrents. I was thinking a more serious and chilled Beck at times. Great for cruising around southern cities at night. Or any other city, town or dell for that matter."
2,Too simplistic,"This books was very, very step-by-step. If you can effectively use windows, then you do not really need a book this simple. There were a few little hints that the book gave that were nice, but really it was mostly a waste of paper. This book could have been condensed into a much smaller(and cheaper) book. I recommend this book to anyone who really wants a book that holds your hand through the entire process."
4,"Good gameplay, old engine.","Might and Magic VIII is a solid addition to this series. Yes, the engine is very dated, but fans of this series will not be too put off by this. The new playable races in this installment are a nice touch, although I would say that with a dragon in your party you have a big advantage. This is because it's basic flame attack uses no spell points and does a lot of damage. The dungeons in this game are not as huge as MM6, which in my opinion is just fine. While MM6 was a superior game, the dungeons did grow tiresome. Overall, this was an enjoyable game, worth the money it costs and I would recommend it to any fan of this series, as long as they can look past the dated graphics."
2,Disapointing - especially compared to the rest of the series,"I have long been a fan of this series and I jumped at thechance to get the next game. I knew before hand that the graphicswould not be the best around, but that wasn't important. The problem was the game felt hollow. There was much less of a plot then any of the others in the series, and was overall disappointing. The gameplay isn't that bad, but I wouldn't recommend this game for any but the most stalwart fans of the series.Might and Magic 6 and 7 were great games in my opinion."
2,Not so good,"Might and Magic VIII was really a dissapointment when I first played it. It has the same game engine as its most recent prequil, but with some downsides. First you only get to create one character, your main character, and the rest of your party is filled up with characters you meet. Second, and lastly, the characters are ugly expecially the male knights. If your a diehard Might and Magic fan (like me) you should definitely buy it (to add to your collection) if not stay away from it. I don't like to dis Might and Magic, but when a product stinks, it stinks."
3,"for the ""science"" inclined","I'll admit it right from the start, I prefer the science in my science fiction to be lighter. Yet, there have been writers who can combine great characters, intriguing situations and hard science. Michael Crichton isn't one of these. A classic worth reading but unless you are very into medical mystery, perhaps not worth buying."
2,Boring,"This is the fifth Michael Crichton book I've read and it is far his worst. I mean, if you don't know a thing about viruses, or any scientific mumbo-jumbo, then your left out to dry in this book. There's maybe 150 interesting pages in the book. It was a good plot and wisely written. But it lacks the explanations on terms and is written as if you should know this material and if you don't you are stupid."
2,Technical Terms Run Wild,"I have read four of Crichton's books before and I have to say this was a disappointment. It was all about the technical terms and the science and doctoral words. Andromeda seemed weighed down by those. The ending cut off too abruptly. The epilogue didn't flow with the story and there were no references to the future. What happened to the disease? Did it kill more people in the world? Did they get samples to study it furter? All these questions left unanswered. Overall, it was not very thrilling. I recommend this to doctors, techno-happy people, and ""sciency"" people. It is an easy read and they could obviously understand it better than me."
3,"Crichton, The Andromeda Strain","The Andromeda Strain was a brief, fun, and anti-climactic novel by Crichton. I gave it four stars though and that does mean I really liked it. I loved the scramble to figure out why an entire town's population, except for two beings, was killed by a contaminated satellite. I love novels where preventing a world-stopping epidemic from spreading, or at least finding a cure for it before it can kill the entire human race, is the main plot. This one does it better than most with its realistic feel as if this actually happened or could happen. Like I said, I found it to be a bit anticlimactic but that is my only complaint. Some of the information in this book, just like all Crichton novels, was a bit much for me and I had to reread some parts, but it is fun to read intelligent fiction too."
3,This book is o.k.,"The Andromeda Strain is overall a pretty good book. However, it lacks action in some parts. Gets boring often."
3,A Great Book,"I thank this book would be alot better if Michael Crichton would have put a lot more exsitment into it. Some of the stronge pints was the sciens lingo and the detale. Michael might have been better off if he would tone down the lingo. The detale was great and inforitive. The weak pint where the ending. It was weak because you are whating for something big at the end, but it did not come."
5,The Andromeda Strain rocks!,"This book is one of the best books that i've ever read. it's intersting, creative, and intelligent. Michael Chrichton is blessed with talented writing. If you read some of his books, be sure to include this one."
3,Good Book- Weak Ending,"The book the Andromeda Strain is one of Michael Crichton's best novels... up until the end. OHHH... the strange virus that turns blood into powder suddenly eats through rubber! OH MY what are the chances of that happening. And guy escaping the ""Inpenitrable Fortress"" with 50 traquilizers stuck in him... WOW! Overall... Great book, But the ending SUCKS"
3,"Great Book, Good Audio Book","The Andromeda Strain, is a classic novel of biological terror. I remember reading it and being on the edge of my seat throughout, so I thought it would be fun to listen to the audio on a recent trip.The first tape is actually kind of boring. Actor, Chris Noth makes all the characters sound very much the same during the first tape, which makes it difficult to follow. (Especially during the many passages of description) However, during the second tape, he seems to find his stride and begins to create vocal characterizations.It was also amazing to me how much the technology of the story is outdated, and/or even common place. The story is still a classic, and the second half of the tape is very good, you just need patience for the first one."
2,It wasn't all that good,"First of all, I thought it was very interesting at the begining. But as I reached the middle I found myself skipping paragraphs, just so I could get it over with. I can understand why they had to go through all those procedures but Crichton could have made it a little more thrilling. And to all the people who keep commenting about the bacteria itself, relax. Just try to imagine that such a bacteria exsists, it's only a book. Use your imagination !!!!"
5,A good book for all to enjoy!,"I just recently finished one of the best books I've ever read. Andromeda Strain was exciting and very action packed through out. One of the main reasons I really liked it was because it started out with a very fast paced and excitng plot. It didn't get caught up in describing the sunset and scenery etc., it just cut to the chase. This book is about five scientists who are trying to get to bottom of a possible biological plague. The strain entered the atmosphere on an unmanned satallite, and that's all they know about it! This book is written very well, and in a style I really enjoy. Michael Crichton writes from the perspective that the whole story is true, and it really happened. He uncovers the top secret dealings of the government and reveals them to the public. All in all this is a great book for any one remotely interested in science fiction, or even if you're not!"
2,Left Me Hungry....For More Details!,"All in all, the book left me hungry for more details and deeper relations to the characters, a climax that was suspended or lengthened would have been nice, and an ending that didn't leave you feeling empty would have been much appreciated. Compared to Crichton's other works, this was a failed attempt to win millions of fans, but surely one that left you thinking. Instead of mesmerizing you chapter by chapter, he waits until you have completely finished the book, laid it down, and then he lingers in your head while you contemplate what just happened. If he wants you to remember this book, he should get five stars. If he wants you to like this book, two stars is the result!"
3,The Andromeda Strain,"I don't know. This book was okay, but I have read better. This book was overflowing with technical insights so if your into a more scientific book, get this. But when I read for pleasure I'd prefer not to read something which reminds me of school. It just didn't hold my attention like Timeline and Jurrasic Park did. It still had a good idea behind it, and it seemed like it could've happened. You should read it on a rainy day."
3,Good Book,"It is a good, quick read - much like all other Crichton books. If you like them, you'll like this one."
1,Undoubtedly the WORST book I have ever read!!,"The first and ONLY book I have read by Mr. Crichton, I expected a book of great suspence and action from an author so widely known. BIG LET DOWN!!! For one thing, the storyline seemed to constantly leave things unexplained (maybe it was just me). In numerous parts of the novel, I found myself reading back two and three pages, thinking I just somehow missed something, but it never did explain what I wanted to know. Also, many terms used could've been, to me, some newly invented language. Maybe it's just because I'm not a science freak. In any case, I thought the book was boring, draggy, and, take away the very first and last few pages, extremely uneventful. What amazed me was the number of acclaims that were listed at the beginning of the book. Were those critics reading the same version of the novel I read?"
2,Get a science degree before reading,"For some reason, even though this book is highly rated, I didn't enjoy it at all. I'm not huge on science, so the technical mumbo jumbo throughout the book was a little to much to handle. I know that I'm not the only one either.I guess I was expecting ""The Stand"" when I picked up this book, so you can imagine how utterly disappointed I was. I felt like Crichton was giving me his resume and showing off his med school mind instead of focusing on making the book enjoyable to read. I kept waiting for the climax....and waiting...and nothing every happened!I give a two star only because I try and reserve 1 stars for terribly atrocious books. This pushed the envelope though."
2,Too Scientific!,"Crichton is a master of detail and tells a very complete story, but this one was just too scientific for my liking."
5,This book was excellent!!!,The book kept me interested. The best part of the book was that it was not far-fetched and that Michael wrote this book about 25 years before diseases like the ebola virus where in the news. Michael Crichton is an excellent writer! He know how to make an ordinary story amazing!
4,The Andromeda Strain explored new avenues of thought,"Michael Crichton's The Andromeda Strain was a brilliant page-turner from start to thrill-packed finish. It offered an enlightening, and refreshingly cerebral, perspective on the possibilities of extraterrestrial life and man's biologic defenses to that life with the complications of socio-political beaurocracy and the challenge of saving the world in a very limited amount of time. I thoroughly enjoyed this book for many reasons, mainly because it challenged a scientifically untrained mind such as mine not only to hang on for the ride but to explore and learn a myriad of new concepts. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wishes to expand their mind and explore new avenues of thought or for anyone who just loves a good suspensful novel and is not afraid of big words."
3,Not that interesting.,"It was one of his ok books, but still very dull in some parts. I didn't like the ending much and the thinking of some people puzzles me. However, it influenced my thinking in someways about aliens and other stuff like that. However, it is an intelligent book."
5,Truely one of Crichton's Best!,This is my favorite of all his books. It requires an interest in the field of medicine/microbiology though. It was great how he inter-twined the fact and fiction of what we know today and leaves the mind open to think of what kind of diseases we will come to face in the future. A real classic for all science fiction lovers!
3,Disappointing,"The Andromeda Strain had great potential, but does not exploit it. The book's action is thinnly widespread, and the technical and scientific terms are a nightmare to read if you don't know them. On the good side, the virus was great, and so were the descriptions."
5,"great, always need to read again!","I remember when i first read this book, i was young, probably too young seeing that i was around 8 years old then. but i could still see how good it was.Now, as a 14 year old that is taking biology, i can understand it all the more clearly. I read it over again every two years becuase i learn more and more things about science. I admire the critchon's guts in using all these techinical terms."
3,so what now?,the book is really great! but what about the end? did crichton run out of paper? it's a pitty he did not finish his great story properly.
3,Pretty Good,I thought this book was way ahead of it's time and fairly interesting. The idea that a disease as deadly as the 'andromeda strain' is very unsettling. 'The Andromeda Strain' is also very realistic and it doesn't seem that unlikely to me. But it seems like I hardly knew anything about the main characters. They were sort of mysterious in regards to their background. They told what they did and where they were from but he didn't really help me to know them real well like in his other books. It was also a little boring at times. But besides those problems it was a greaet book.
2,A strain? It's more of a stretch.,"I'm getting to the point where I'm starting to think I should just quit reading Crichton's books. ""Prey"" was OK; ""State of Fear"" was pretty dreadful. Thankfully, those and this book are the only ones I've read so far. I'm not even going to touch ""Next,"" from what I've heard. I picked up this early book of his, hoping maybe it'd be different. But no -- it's the same old cardboard characters whose quirks are told to us rather than shown (did he never attend even one writing workshop?). The same old making science into an image that fits the plot, bending facts at will and just making some up (eg, having the guys swim open-eyed through some mysterious disinfectant, like that's going to get all the bacteria...). The same old blunt-force foreshadowing. The same old lecturing and moralizing. Ugh. The one saving grace was that it was a fast read."
2,Andromeda Strain,"I'm not sure why this clumsy book has been re3-introduced to the public. Perhaps because thoise who saw the movie so many years ago have either died off (from causes other than deep-space viruses) and the publisher hopes to dupe a few additional readers. The basic concept, of an unexpected deadly virus being brought down to earth, isn't bad. It's just a bit too unbelievable here in the 2000's."
2,The Andromeda Strian Reviewed,"The Andromeda Strain comes across as a book that should be an on the edge of your seat, nail biter type of read. This was my misconception. The book is actually very information and a little bit interesting for scientifically gifted people. Most of the book uses many techinical and scientific terms I was not familiar with, but I could catch on. The last part of the story really carries the weight of the entire book. There is not much progress in about the first fifteen chapters of the book, but near the end it picks up and the plot thickens, making a person nibble, not bite their nails. Overall I found the book to be satisfactory, but not a best-seller in my humble opinion."
1,Not one of his better books!,I have read many books by Mr.Crichton. This book is not one of his best. I have read over 21 books for my reports this year and I wrote this opne was one of the worst. The book Postman was the only worst one. The character development is very impaired. I am unable to assosciate with any of them. Association to a character is something I need to get into a book. I belive other books such as Sphere and Jurasic Park were much better. The content in both books were closer to sci-fi than other books. Empidemics are something we are used to reading and seeing nowadays. I teachers at school taught u to write with adjectives which this book is lacking. Do not read this book if you have something better to do.
1,A mess of a novel,"This book is thought of by many to be a sort of modern classic, but I really didn't like it. It's full of plot twists that lead absolutely NOWHERE. There are certain revelations that make the preceding part of the novel seem a total waste of time. The character's efforts have no effect and eventually, the book is resolved when the virus mutates into a harmless form. The whole book is a waste of time. The characters are useless. The book is just a way for Crichton to show off medicla knowledge. All in all, it's a mess"
1,A doctor that doesn't know biology?,"As a biologist and a med. student I am appalled that Crichton made a basic and blatant error that his entire book rests on. If you have a population of organisms, and there is a mutation, THE WHOLE POPULATION DOES NOT MUTATE TOGETHER. The majority of the population stays in the old form. In this book Crichton has a population of organisms that all mutate together into a few scary things and then finally into something harmless and that saves the day. If this were REAL biology we would have a separate population surviving after each mutation. At the end of the book there would still be a population of rubber-eaters as well as a toxic population, etc. Needless to say this ""Deus ad-lib"" was a huge let down. Crichton needs to go back and read some of his biology texts. No wonder he doesn't practice medicine any more."
3,Andromeda Strain,"The Andromeda Strain is the depiction of how a rare disease attacks the body and alters its blood. It goes through the process of how four scientists discover the effects of this disease and how it attacks peoples circulatory systems. It is not a story to read if you do not feel like thinking. This novel is filled with deep scientific facts and is not to be considered and easy read. I do not recommend this novel to those who are not fans of science fiction, your attention will be lost very quickly otherwise."
3,Good but ended too abruptly,"This was a good book I believe. However the thing that bothered me the most was the ending. It almost seemed as though Crichton got bored with writing it and cooked up some ending to get it out the door. Otherwise, it was entertaing and I would recommend it to anyone."
4,Good Book!,"It's amazing that this book is 30 years old. The book is loaded with physics and boilogy, but still reads pretty easy. I definately plan on reading more from Chrichton."
3,"Reading should be entertaining, not homework","If you're familiar with Mr. Crichton's more recent string of hits, you should instantly divine that this was an effort of long ago. One of his first novels, in fact, if I'm not mistaken, Mr. Crichton's premise for a biological Apocalypse shuffles along at a snail's pace. What could've been a truly zip-along read is plagued and ultimately bogged down with interminable sequences of 'faction.' Understanding why the long passages of facts are present does not counteract their tedious and painstakingly detailed drone. The flip-side of this, however, is that The Andromeda Strain is a powerful science document. Unfortunately, it exhibits little else. Bottom line: A nice effort from a fledgling writer; Mr. Crichton has matured remarkably throughout the advancement of his career."
5,"Very good, but not his best.","I am a very big fan of Crichton, and I think that his books are great, but on his scale this is not his best. It's just a bit too technical. I mean, unless you're a bioligy fan, it's not very intreresting to read pages over pages of tables. But, it's crichton, so read it!Dassi."
2,Cynosure Scallions on the Mountain Look Downwards (Upon?) the Zebus & Sevens,Really tried to like this book. Premise was grand; story bobbed and weaved; conclusion was flimsy. Discursive scientific literalizations distract & disorient. Crichton breaks the rule to never stanch the flow. I dislike the quartet of scientists who investigate the outbreak; they don't come across to the reader as likeable.
3,"Too Much Toxicology, Too Little Story","Crighton's books are always well researched and the Andromeda Strain is no exception. Unfortunately, the story is overwhelmed by the science. In fact, it's 90% science, including expansive explanations of toxicology, biology, and diseases, and only 10% story. I happen to like science, but most people will likely find it unbearably tedious. The beginning of the book sizzles and hooks you. The ending is a dud."
1,Good build up but disappointing ending,"I loved the way the book starts off and right away you are in the thick of the plot. I espically like the way Mr. Crichton sticks to the main story but as I start see how few pages are left to read, I begin to wonder how he wraps up the story in so short a time. Now I am on the last chapter and it seems that when Mr. Crichton was writing the novel, he just decided he had had enough and just banged out a few pages to abruptly end it.The abrupt and shallow ending spoilt what could otherwise have been a classic. Maybe someday Mr. Crichton could go back, delete the existing last chapter and actually finish the book."
3,UHHH this is what evryone says is awsome,"alright I guess. Although it moves at a speed I like the book is only second rate compared to his other books. Worth the time spent reading it, but definatly disappointing compared to his other works. Give it a try maybe you'll like it better than me"
3,Stereotypical Crichton Book,This is now the sixth Crichton book I've read and I always seem to come away with the same feeling...slightly disappointed. I always enjoy the immense amount of detail he provides in his books about the subject matter at hand but am always disappointed in character development. His characters are typically very thin and I am left at the end of the book not really caring about how the story ends. If rating this book based on the interesting background on biochemical studies I rate this book a five. If rating the book on character development I rate it a one. Overall a three.
5,"Well written, suspenseful, shows Crichton's knowledge","Michael Crichton is my favorite author, and this book shows his ability to write a very good book without a lot of action and blood. This Book misleads you and many places, (E.g., you think the man in the white robe, Peter Jackson, killed the men retrieving the space probe)and eventually leads up to a good yet unsatisfying ending. Crichton also does a good job explaining some of the terms he uses. He also lets the reader know about things the characters don't, like that Leavitt is epileptic, and that Burton made a big mistake when he forgot to autopsy the anticoagulated black norway rats. Overall, this is a great book, although a little more action would be nice."
5,Important lessons,"For me it's the best book I ever read (even from Michael Crichton). At first I thought there would be some kind of magic involved, but in the end everything turned out to have a logical explanation. The book may be a little old by now, but it still contains important lessons. Perhaps they will help us to be prepared in similar cases, when we are getting into such extraordinary situations.If you are interested in the government's handling procedures in such critical cases, you just have to read this book or Sphere, which I like very much too, and you'll at least have a very good insight.Thanks to M.C."
5,One of my favorite books,"I read this book for school, during the summer. I wasn't expecting much, since I had never read a Michael Crichton book before, I just knew him as ""The dude who wrote Jurassic Park"". The amazing thing about this book and most of Chrichton's other novels is that he makes an exciting mix of action with, well, events that don't put you to sleep, and a lot of realism to back the plot up. I'd suggest this to everyone, because the story is just so amazing. That's all I have to say."
3,NicK's Super Review,"The Andromeda Strain is a sci-fi thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat.....sometimes. This book was sometimes really boring because half the time they are in a labratory trying to figure out what the virus is. However, there are some very interesting and action-packed parts that made it an ok book. I have not read any other Michael Crichton books but I hear that they are very good. The Andromeda Strain may be one of his worst, I disliked most parts because they were very boring to me, they just test things in a lab and I don't understand it. I liked the very end and when they go to the town, those are the best parts. This was an ok book that would be good if they had spent less time in the lab testing stuff."
3,A very captivating book for its tiem.,"'The Andromeda Strain' involves a new deadly disease that has been brought back to earth, by a military/science sattelite. A space rpogram has been designed to enter space and bring back samples in the hopes of finding a new bacterial weapon. The book describes a secret government base where such diseases can be contained and researched.Well, the program is a success. A deadly germ is brought back to Earth, and proceeds to wipe out a remote town. The germ is isolated in the governmetn facility, and the race is on to find how this entity reactes with the human body and how it can be cured or neutralized.The book is a little dated, but none the less a great plot. I remember seeing the movie when I was young and loving it. I finally found the time to read the book. It is one of Critchon's early works, but stil very good.If you are a Critchon fan (or not) I would recommend this book. It is quick paced and good for those days beside the pool or at the beach."
2,Good- Until the disappointing ending,"I have enjoyed the Michael Crichton books until I read this one. The Andromeda Strain proves itself a smart, fast moving book until the last 5 or so pages I read. The end makes you wonder why you read 281 pages just to get to this."
3,recommended for armchair xenobiologists,Re-read after a (10-15?) year hiatus from my original reading. Crichton makes for a quick read and he throws out some compelling ideas in his prose. This one is a real page-turner. I enjoy the novel-as-historical-document style that he adopts here (and (if I recall correctly) in some of his other work) but it also colors the text a bit and makes for some awkward passages in places.
4,What?!?,Has a nice story. A thriller through and through. Poor ending from a great climax though. All in all not a bad experience. (^0^)
3,An entertaining read - Until the end.,"In his book The Andromeda Strain, Michael Crichton has crafted a fairly excellent story, explaining very complex technology in simple terms while building a dynamic plot and filling the world with believable characters. However, The Andromeda Strain did have a disappointing end (As in, the challenge being overcome too easily) and should those last few chapters of the book be different, I'd have given it four or five stars."
3,Almost great.,"I am a big Crichton fan and expect a certain level of writing when I read his stuff. This book was not up to that level. I enjoyed it very much and found it difficult to put down, but it seemed that he lacked some experience when writing this. It was well researched and all, but there were some things (like Leavitt having epilepsy) that left me thinking ""what possible reason does this have?"" He got off to a great start, but it should have been about three times as long. The ending was too abrupt and ""blah"" for me."
4,Great suspensful novel!,One Crichtons Good books. For being his first book it was really good but I think that it could use a little more action.
3,Great build-up that runs off the rails,"I read ""The Andromeda Strain"" about five years ago. The first 80-90% of the work was near perfect: absolutely brilliant writing, full of suspense, that I found almost literally hair-raising.Unfortunately, it appears that somewhere along the way, Crichton boxed himself into a corner, and couldn't find a plausible way out. The net result is one of the most illogical endings I have ever read; the final 20 or 30 pages feel like they have nothing to do with what has gone before. [The problems begin when they find out exactly what the Andromeda Strain is--or, perhaps, more properly, what it *isn't*.]While it is by no means a bad book, I was still much disappointed by the ending."
2,Started out promising but then turned very disapointing,"For thr first 30 - 40 pages I was really into this book. But then it just got worse as every page went on. It took me 2 weeks to read this book, which is way too long for a book this short. It was just too dry. It seemed more like a scientific manual than a novel. I like reading Sci-fi but it almost seemed like you had to be a Dr. to understand what was going on. Michael Crichton is a very good author but this is defenitly not a good example of that."
4,Andromeda strain,It was a really good book up until the last chapter. Michael Crichton is a good author but can't finish.
3,Andromeda Strain,"The Andromeda Strain, by Michael Crichton, is a book about four scientists struggling to understand an extraterrestrial virus that literally kills in seconds. This book is extremely interesting and scientifically in depth. If you are a science enthusiast, you will love this book. I liked the book, but there were some things that I would have changed. There was a lot of background information during the book explaining why certain events happened. This information seemed too much and the novel could have been much more interesting if some of it was removed. Like I said, people who are interested in the science background would definitely like this book. Anybody who didn't take biology in high school wouldn't understand the basics of the virus in the story. If I were to change anything about this book, I would remove some of the background information and unnecessary events in the story. Overall, it has a good storyline and makes complete sense at the end of the book."
3,His best?,"Although this is by no means a bad book, I have to say that I was disappointed with it. Considering that it is heralded as Crichton's best, I really expected more. I've read Jurassic Park, Rising Sun, Lost World, Congo, Binary, Sphere Airframe and Timeline. I enjoyed them all, especially Jurassic Park which is perhaps the greatest book ever written by anyone (I've read that about 8 times now). Andromeda Strain isn't, as I say, a bad book. I have a great deal of respect for Micheal Crichton and I love much of his work, but this one seemed to misfire a bit. It just didn't grip me like any of the above titles did. I didn't even finish it the first time I tried to read it."
3,"Good book, not his best","I must admit that when I read this I was already spoiled by Crichton's later books, which were great (Jurassic Park, Sphere, Congo). Its a good book, but definately not his best."
4,"Not Crichtons best, but good","Andromeda Strain was good, but I think it doesn't rival Sphere or Jurassic Park. It had a great theme, but the ending was a little depressing, I mean, you just expect a little more from a killer organism then simply transforming to eat rubber, don't you"
2,Ending was a major let down.,"This book seemed to be a display of the authors scientific knowledge. I liked the idea behind the book, but it just did not deliver... the ending was very lame."
3,The Andromeda Strain,"Interesting flashback to an earlier version of medical science fiction. I read it after viewing the recent remake for TV of the film version, and in anticipation of viewing the original film version on DVD.The recent TV remake is better than the book, which today seems a little hackneyed. This long-ago first novel by Crichton included enough errors in the author's writing craft that, today, I must wonder how it ever got published."
3,This is Not Crichton's Best Book by a Long Shot,"THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN was Michael Crichton's first big novel, written in 1968. It's a remarkably inventive novel about a killer virus that has come to earth.This book, which many critics claim is Crichton's best novel, is actually not even close to that. THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN is enjoyable, but is nowhere near as good as some of Crichton's later works, such as THE GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY, SPHERE and JURASSIC PARK.My problem with this book is the almost non-existent characterization. Most of the scientist characters are bland and almost interchangeable. Crichton invests little time in developing their personalities. Instead, he spends page after page on explaining a lot of technical details, which gives this novel a definite non-fiction kind of a feel. The ending of this novel is also remarkably limp, given the massive buildup.THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN is interesting, but I felt it fell short on the storytelling, which made for a rather flat reading experience."
4,Interesting Concept,"This book is about a space capsule from space that fell down into a small town in Arizona. And the capsule carried an organism from space, that killed the whole population in a small town, except two survivers. Four scientists then meet at an underground site called ""Wildlife"" and goes on to investigate the microorganism and how the two people managed to survive.At least that is what people in the 60s believed: that bacteria brought down to space by a satellite or organisms from space entering the Earth would cause some kind of crisis like death. But not right now, no, astronauts can come back and go home immediately instead of going through a 3 week decontamination process, since no life form have been found anywhere in space... Yet.This book was written in 1969, and remember that time has changed, and beliefs have changed, so don't read this book and laugh at the idea because 2000's and 1960's are totally different eras.Anyway, it was an intersting book. I liked it!"
3,Not the best from this author,"I love how easily Michael Crichton brings esoteric subjects to laymen in understandable terms. This book is no exception. That being said, there is little else I liked about this book. There is a lot of superfluous information about the characters. There is a lot of foreshadoiwing that left me waiting for something really extraordinary to happen, and nothing really ever did. The plot kept building as if at any moment the characters will realize how dangerous the situation is in which they have found themselves. However, the suspense is unfulfilled, and the ending very anticlimactic. I will continue to read books by this author, but I can not recommend this book."
3,this was a pretty good book,The Andromeda Strain is kind of wierd. Sometimes it seemed like it just dragged on and on. The old guy was funny when he was telling Mark Hall that he could do what he wanted because he's old. The ending was very dissapointing. Overall it was worth reading but not the best book you can get.
4,If the level is a rockin'-don't bother knockin'!,"Aliens attacking your circulatory system? Oh it can happen! You just check out the Andromeda Strain and eat your heart out! Literally! I don't want to spoil it for you, but man, you better hope it doesn't happen. A mysterious outbreak of unexplainable deaths has occured in this small town in New Mexico in 1971. Wearing the tackiest bubbles, these Top Secret government officials go in to check out the scene. If I tell you what they saw, I'd prolly have to kill you. These scientists go through all of these decontaminization levels to rid themselves of this ""alien"" bacteria then they get to level five, WHOOOHOOO! I have to watch my words, but they all go scenile in the end, that'll catch your attention! The red lights go off! AAAHHH!It's an excellent story, but carry along a bag of chex mix--It's gonna be a loooonnnngggg riiiddeee.Have fun! And rock on sci-fi channel!"
3,"Contrived and forced, not the best of Crichton","First and foremost, a book has to be entertaining. At times, Andromeda Strain entertains, but most the time I found myself just wishing it was over so I could move to something not so slow and tedious - like watching golf. Like most of Crichton's books, learning about the abstract or obscure permeates the story, however it lacks the enthusiasm and creativity that ""Jurassic Park"" or ""Rising Sun"" exemplify. I felt as if I was reading a bad attempt to make medical history and bio-epidemiology fun"
3,Book or Science Class,The Andromeda StrainBy: Michael Crichton3 out of 5 StarsThe Andromeda Strain starts out by having a called Piedmont dieing. Everyone in the town died. An organization monitoring Piedmont wants to find out what happened so they go to a secret government base called Wildfire. They start doing tests to see if they can find out what happened in Piedmont. They return to Piedmont and they find a man and a baby who is still alive. They use the baby and the man to find out why the Andromeda Strain didn't affect them.In this book I liked the beginning. It was fast paced and a lot of things happening.I didn't like how the book was full of science terms. It made the book a bit hard to understand. The more you read the book the less action occurs. It was hard to determine whether this was a Sci-Fi or a mystery.I think someone who took science in as there major in college would like this book. It would probably make a lot more sense to them.
3,"Ok, but...","a problem is the absence of common sense. There is a happy ending because the virus or whatever it was, mutated into something benign. But as my father pointed out a long time ago, so what if one of many many individuals of a certain species of virus mutates into something nicer? It does nothing to lessen the virulence of the vast majority of that species. If the original virulent strain burned itself out by killing all its hosts and then was successfully quarantined, that would make a sensible almost happy ending.If you want good ""hard"" science fiction with a human element, try early Heinlein instead.(pre 1963)"
4,"Great Book, Bad Ending!","It's a really great book, never seen such a nice sci-fi novel. But the ending was a bit disappointing. Otherwise, fabulous novel!! Don't mis it!"
3,Hmmm....,"Well, the first 150 pages ruled, then it got dull. Mr. Chrichton seemed to forget what he was doing, and tried to ""fill space"". I actually wet myself in the first 100 pages it was so intense. But something was missing from the second half. I recomend it. But don't expect the most emmaculate of endings."
3,A Far Cry From His Best,"This has all the usual elements of an average Crichton thriller. It is similar in characters, construction and execution to its kin ""Rising Sun"" and ""The Terminal Man"". And yet while this novel tackles a more credible and realistic subject than either, the conclusion is so obviously half-baked it's laughable. I find it very hard to swallow that an entire team of microbiologists and other scientists would have overlooked such an obvious solution for so long.""The Andromeda Strain"" contains all the expected Crichton ingredients for a bestseller, but, for me, it seems this time things didn't turn out just as well as they usually do."
3,Could have been better...,"Don't get me wrong.. The book was great, I didn't want to put it down, and it made me think. But, some of the parts were boring and were lagging on a bit (kind of like he was trying to take up space maybe). The ending was also pretty dissapointing, partially because it was somewhat predictable. But hey, buy the book, it will make you think twice about some things . . ."
1,Can ya give this a 0???,Item had been previously opened and returned...parts do not fit together...front ring nut is cross-threaded. Thank goodness for Amazon's return policy!!!!! No replacement here...we're getting a refund!
1,Safety Concern,"I purchased this grinder locally yesterday(not through amazon) for $39.99 .First I washed it thoroughly ,looking for any stains or metal shavings. I began to grind some chicken ,I noticed that the ground chicken had a gray tint to it with small metal shavings! and it got worse as I kept ""grinding"",I noticed a lentil size hard metal chip with sharp edges in the ground meat!what if I was grinding something of a dark color that made noticing the metal piece impossible?? what if it had been consumed? broken teeth would have been the best case scenario !Since I had carefully washed the ""grinder"" and looked everywhere in it ,the chip wasn't just sitting in there ,it must have shaved off then.I threw away the ground chicken ,washed the grinder to return it . This morning I noticed rust all over the blade and front pieces ,what a masterpiece."
1,I received a defective product. Still waiting for a replacement,I called the number in the package for replacement at the grinder could by any means be opened. I am still waiting for a replacement.
3,gave as a gift,"I bought this item as a gift: the recipient liked it, but I am not sure if she has used it yet.Item arrived fully packaged and undamaged in the time specified.Thank you."
1,Poor Quality,I had hoped this would be a replacement for my very ancient grinder. Something to use to help my daughter with processing the meat from her pig. Also to use to grind fresh beef cubes. No such luck. The grinder is poorly made and the front piece keeps falling off. And it is a screw on piece. Should have paid more attention to the reviews. Never did get to try the sausage stuffing parts.
1,not happy with grinder,"Upon receiving this grinder I discovered a part missing; should have two sized grinding hole attachments and only received one. Took me 5 days to receive a call back from the company to take care of my complaint. Was told the missing ""wheel"" would be sent to me. After several weeks I still have not received the part. Also the actual grining parts do not fit well. Would not recommend this to anyone. Am still waiting for the part."
1,Not happy with product,"This meat grinder was not inspected very well if at all. There was extra material that hit the auger when you tried to use it, the handle had to be pounded on with a hammer because it was so tight. It ended up in the trash!!!"
1,Broke immediately,"The meat grinder is plated and the plating began flaking off when we tried to use it the first time. It wasn't worth the trouble to return, so I pitched it."
1,NOT a Czech Porkert grinder,"This is NOT a Czech Porkert grinder, but a Chinese imitation. It is poorly made, with poor plating and rough machining. On the positive side, it actually does grind meat - but I had to sharpen the blades first."
1,buyer beware,"I wanted the grinder as pictured. However, I was mailed the Clamp down. Upon advising the vendor, I was e-mailed back stating that I should have been specific that I wanted the bolt down as shown on photo....okay, whatever. To add to insult the grinder sent appeared to be a return or restock. I'll have to try to get rid of it in a garage sale..Weston 36-1001-W Deluxe H/D Manual Tinned Meat Grinder w/ Deluxe Accs Kit (#10)"
1,meat,this product does not fit securely on the counter and certainly does not hold tight enough to grind meat. It was almost impossible to grind ( maybe if I were a 300 football player I could have done it). It also weighs a TON!!!

1,attaching handle difficult,I was lucky to be able to force the screw tight enough to get it to workPoor manufacturing and quality control
1,i wouldn't recomend it,"i wouldn't recomend it, because it has poor quality workmanship, and it broke the first and only time i used it..."
1,Product was manufactured poorly,The wooden handle was broke and the cookie attachment didn't fit with it because the notch in the grider did not line up with it. We returned the item.
5,Trusted product,I bought this cranberry extract for my dog as she needs to take these every day for the rest of her life. My dog is a golden retriever mix and she has done well taking this brand.
2,Hard to swallow,"I got this brand, trying new one's, to see which one I like best. This one is very, VERY, hard to swallow with a glass of anything. Unlike most of Nature's Way's products which I would recommend to others, this one I would not."
4,This album is for Bone Players !,Ignore the previous reviewer. If you look at all that guy's reviews they are all one star and completely negative. At least he is consistant and I hope he cheers up soon.Here is a nice album recorded live at a session with Mingus bringing together 4 of the great modern trombonists. If ya don't like bebop don't buy it. Such a dichotomy of approaches to playing the instrument. A feast for jazz trombonists and a chance to hear these guys stretch out !
1,murder by bones,"This CD should be titled ""The Art of Murdering NiceSongs."" Listen to ""Stardust""(is it really Stardust?)and you'll see what I mean. Beboppers should see ashrink instead of bothering us with their nervousticks(or licks?)."
1,Not Recommended,I bought these on the hope that I'd find a relatively unknown but excellent canalphone. I was wrong. The sound is tinny and the build quality was sub-par. They broke within a month. Not Recommended!
2,Read Carefully before you buy it!,"I have listen to almost all AR books and definetly he is a very good writer and motivator. he helped me a lot. My comment is not on his work but on this book particulairly.Before you really go and purchase please do know that this book is no different than other AR books. His theory is based on one 6 steps formulawhich is repeated over and over again. I think he is good in marketing because he covers same formula with different packages. There is nothing new in this book than his first book.However if you never listened or read his books this is the most comprehensive one. I advise you to purchase an audio version because u get more motivated with his voice. But if you had already other Anthony books, dont waste ur money. Try Power of Now!"

3,False Advertising... These are audio CD's not video DVD's,"I haven't opened the box yet, but was surprised that Amazon would allow this seller to apparently continue selling audio CD's while claiming they are DVD's (video).They are indeed audio CD's as it clearly says on the sides and back of the box (not shown on the front of the box which is pictured in the listing).I suppose for 6 hours worth of Tony Robbins it's still a good value (MSRP on the back lists $39.95 in USA), but that's not the point.DO NOT CALL THEM DVD's when they are NOT... Amazon needs to clamp down on this and it should not be tolerated!"
1,Infomercial on audio cd,This Audio CD wasn't much more then a long infomercial. I didn't get much of value out of it. Don't waste your money.
2,Lessons in Mumbo Jumbo,"Being a critic for years, I picked this one up a week ago and listened to it. I think its a follow up to his other longer programs. Being as there is only one other review and its a positive one, I felt it was my duty to step in and let the public how crappy this set really is. I mean, how many programs does he need to come out with? Its like everyone is the one to change your life. Its all the same repeitive stuff. Not only is the sound quality poor, but the cds lack content as well. Just a lot of personal stories, seminar plugs, etc. I still can't beleive morons fall for this stuff. Get it through your head the guy's a phony."
2,God help us all,"I actually went through this one again. Maybe I did miss something. Nope. It's still garbage. Tony markets people common sense. His 'ideas' are ones you probably knew when you were 12 years old. Im not saying the advice is bad, but it's common sense. You don't need to listen to Tony to produce results. Most of these 'success/motivation' programs are for the weak. I don't need someone else telling me what to do or how to live my life."
2,Please go to the next one...,"This was my first Linda Howard book and unfortunately, it may be my last. Open Season was very shallow in its story line. Characters jump into situations without much thought and the book seems to have been written on a whim."
2,Average,"This is not one of my favorites. It was a ok read with not alot of action and the ending I wish could have had a little more excitment.The interaction between Jack and Daisy seemed alittle forced with her telling him he's not her type and there was no chemistry between them, something was missing there for me. The way Howard described Jack - graying hair, thick neck, body builder, is that supposed to be attractive? I felt Howard wrote more about the puppys antics than she cared to write about the romance or action. The book was worth reading if you have nothing else to read or important to do. It just could have been so much better. Not up to Howards usual books."
3,Not Great! Good romance but nothing else was interesting!,"Story was a drag, in fact i skipped pages that didn't contain Diasy and Jack together which i rarely do.Jack was really great. Daisy was sometimes too uptight but at least she did realise she was wrong in behaving like everyone's School teacher.Jack did manage to loosen her a bit which she really needed. Jack was so sweet with her worthless dog.Except for jack i don't think this romance has got anything good to offer.Some readers wrote that this book was almost as good as 'Mr. Perfect' but i disagree because i have read that one and loved it. this was was no where near it. But still you could read this one just for the sake of the romance which is funny and sweet."
2,Is only one Linda Howard in this world?,"I just don't believe that I read a two star book from Linda. After I read Mr. Perfect, After the Night and Dream Man, and I saw this book in the book store I almost had a fight with another costumer for the last one (just kidding), and when I started to read it I just couldn't believe what I was reading, if this book were written by other person I just would't finish it, but I said: give it a try and then I was in the middle of the book so I finished it.The main story of the book is hard enough to remember, this book goes out of story so many times, for example: it has a full chapter when Daisy went to make her hair and make up, so what with that, who cares! Another is when her new pet destroyed her new house so what! And many more.When I saw this book I thought that I would laugh a lot and have a nice time, so please Linda, make another book to take me this bad flavor of my mouth."
2,Pay the ransom! Please!!,"After reading the last several Linda Howard novels, I can only assume is that she was kidnapped about five years ago, and her publisher decided it was cheaper to hire a ghost writer than to pay the ransom the kidnappers demanded. All I can say is: Pay the ransom! The real Linda Howard wrote such wonderful romances for Silhouette and several early on for Pocket, but this ""ghost"" can't begin to match her emotional depth, plotting or characterization. Get her back before her reputation is ruined past redemption!"
2,Whatever happened to the Linda Howard romance?,"If you're looking for one of those heart-throbbing romances, typical of the old Linda Howard, you're going to be disappointed with this. Unfortunately, Ms. Howard has been slowly but surely drifting away from her gripping love stories and venturing more toward--well, simply telling a story. Yes, there's a romance here, but it's just a small part of the whole, instead of BEING the whole. I was left in awe when I read Mackenzie's Mountain, truly half in love with Zane when I finished Mackenzie's Pleasure, wistful by the power and strength of Kell Sabin from Diamond Bay . . . . Open Season, however, insomuch as the story was enjoyable, left me with little more than a closed book when I was finished reading. Sorry, Ms. Howard. In fact, I'm one of your biggest fans. But I miss the love in your love stories."
3,"So, So....","I am a huge fan of Linda Howard and have avidly enjoyed all her books. I have to say, while I enjoyed OPEN SEASON, it does not get the rating that ALL THE QUEEN'S MEN and MR. PERFECT got from me. It seemed to go so fast and simple. I totally enjoyed the mystery element, I find romances more intriguing if there is a lot of mystery. And, unlike other reviewers, I thought there was a good balance between in the book. However, both sides felt choppy and rushed. I actually finished the book feeling cheated. Where was the rest of it?I think I might feel a little differently if I had waited for softcover, but Howard's last few books have been so great that I rushed to buy this one. I might think twice next time and just wait for soft cover. Ah well, we win some, we lose some. This one is a draw. I will still look forward to Ms. Howard's next book!"
1,Surprise,"If you are looking for one of those heart-throbbing romances, that Linda Howard typical writes, you are going to be disappointed with this. To my very disappointment, Ms. Howard has been slowly but moving away from her wonderful love stories (my favorites: After the Night, Shades of Twilight, Duncan's Bride, Loving Evangeline, to mentioned a few), into stories without any heart felt, heart moving stories that just that ""stories"". I would like for Ms. Howard to read some of her old love stories to capture the feeling again.Whatever happened to characters such as Zane and Joe, as well as Duncan (and the characters from Shades of Twilight, Roanna and). With the power and strength of their characters that made their stories so compelling and pleasurable to read. . . . Open Season, however, made me wondering if I was reading a book written by Linda Howard. I am one of your biggest fans and I miss your love stories. Both Mr. Perfect and this last one Open Season were a big disappointment to me,"
3,Should've Been A Paperback...,"As a HUGE Linda Howard Fan, I have to say I was mildly disappointed in the somewhat lackluster story. The humor was OK, but it just didn't grab you. Daisy was UNreal; let's face it - no one THAT prim & proper turns into a party girl after 34 years of being a prude. Jack Russo is believable, but I'm just not convinced they're a matched set. The underlying story of the illicit sex trade is tantalizing, but not much comes of that. The character Glenn Sikes is an enigma, however, and it is hinted that LH has some plans for him...."
2,What a disappointment!!,"I have read every one of Linda Howard's books and rarely have been disappointed in anything but there's always a first time. These characters were not developed, there was very little insight into why they acted as they did, no real plot development and an ending that was just plain flat. This one is going back to the store. I do not recommend a purchase."
2,Not her best,"I would recommend any book Linda Howard has written over this one. She's long been one of my favorite authors, but this was just -- dull."
2,A touch better than fluffy teenage romance,"The story was simple and very predictable. It was easy reading and fairly entertaining but Linda Howard is capable for more. This seems like a half-hearted, half-baked and tired story that churned out just for the sake of launching a new book. The author could do more to develop the character and add more plot twists. I will feel sad that if there is no difference between Linda Howard's books and those fluffy teenage romance."
2,Linda Howard wrote this?????????????????,"If this had been my first LH novel, it probably would have been my last!! She must have had half a brain when she wrote this. NO dialogue, NO plot and NO suspense. Buy this book used if possible, because you will be upset if you paid full price."
4,Nice Linda Howard-- Problems Solved too Easily,"This book is ""classic Linda Howard"" to a point, but I scored it only 4 stars, because I feel the book wrapped up too neatly and quickly.Also, the lead male character was too cookie-cutter beefcake. The female lead was very nicely developed and original, but you felt (if you are a Howard fan and have read all her books) that you could interchange her male lead with any of her other males like Mr. Perfect's Sam or Mackenzie's Wolf or Joe or Chance or....If you are a Linda Howard fan you will want this book; it is a keeper. I just wish the problems hadn't been so conveniently and too-neatly wrapped up and the male lead so cookie-cutter."
4,Ms. Howard Does It Again,"When I read what the book was about, I didn't think it would be up to Ms. Howard's usual writing. Was I ever wrong -- this just proves not to judge a book by its cover, in this case its dust cover. Once again Ms. Howard writes a good, steamy, romatic thriller."
3,Not as good as the others.,"I am an avid reader of Linda Howard's books. Each time a new book comes out, I'm online ordering or off to the nearest bookstore to purchase it. Ms. Howard has enormous writing talent, as shown with her previous books. Open Season, however, was not ""her usual style"". I anticipated reading the book into the early hours of a weekend night. Instead, I put it down after reading 1/3 through and have yet to pick it up to finish it. There were humorous moments in the book and Daisy is quite a character. However, the book did not have a smooth flow to it and the story was not as gripping as for example, Son of the Morning, which I think is one of her very best books."
3,Not Howard's Best--But Still Enjoyable,"This book started out great, the transformation of the lead character from mousy and boring to sleek and glamorous was as interesting premise as always, but towards the middle the story kind of tapered off. The romance and dialogue between the two main characters seemed both rushed and a little trite. As for the main man, he never seems to really be developed and the length of time spent on describing the dog is just too much for. The ending however, both intrigued and confused me. It was definitely two loose ends that I think could have been explained much better, but just imagine the explanation!Normally, Linda Howard is my absolute favorite author, and although I enjoyed this book, it just didn't seem up to par for her."
3,Not Her Best,This book was one tired little puppy (pun intended). Usually her books are very gripping. I especially like when she adds paranormal elements. Nothing like that going on here. Reminds me of Jayne Ann Krentz or Sandra Brown when they start cranking out books instead of writing stories where you care about the characters.
2,Good story - but lacking,"I liked the story, but found the characters at times lacking, the story predictable, the names bazaar and well, weird. There were holes in the story where I could see a plot twist, yet there wasn't one. It felt like a really good first draft of a novel, that maybe her editor didn't have time to do a thorough read through of. This is my first Linda Howard novel - so forgive me if this is an exception to the rule about her work."
5,"A fun, rainy-day read!","This was a quick, enjoyable read. A friend passed it on to me and frankly, I thought it would be a bore. I was so wrong! There's romance, humor and suspense, and I couldn't put it down."
1,What happened here?,"This is not the type of writing I am used to from Linda Howard. The storyline was uninteresting as were the characters. A desperate attempt to keep us interested is made when a puppy is introduced into the story & we have to read about his antics. Please! I agree with the reviewer from Dallas that it's hard to believe someone who wrote a book like Son of the Morning could come up with this boring waste. I'd rather Ms. Howard wait until her writer's block is gone before handing her loyal readers this kind of garbage. Sorry, but I'm really upset that I bought this book & I expect much, much better."
1,Open Season,"This book is a total disappointment. The synopsis on the book jacket was more interesting than the actual book. I have read a large number of Ms. Howard's books, and for the most part enjoyed them, but this book was a total snooze. This is one book that I wanted to return to the store after I had read only 10 pages, but I kept going hoping it would get better--it didn't. The book jacket implies that there is going be a great mystery and romance, you get neither one. If you still want to read this book, wait for the paperback, save yourself some money!"
3,A Mediocre Read,This was an OK book - the writing is excellent but the storyline is a little weak and ends too neatly and predictably. The character development of Daisy the librarian is great but her romantic (and sexual)relationship with the police chief is not well developed. I liked the book mainly because it was well written despite problems with the story so I'll give Linda Howard another chance with another of her novels.
3,Good romance with a horrible ending,"While I enjoyed the romance, the sinister atmosphere and suspense was built up for nothing because the heroine was never in any real danger at all. The ending was just horrible. Why was it even necessary? Overall, the story was good but not extraordinary and you really could wait for it in paperback. I recommend reading her other novels if your new and want to read her: After the Night, Son of the Morning and her series books like MacKenzie's Mountain and MacKenzies Mission.My grade for this book would be a C+"
3,Wait for the paperback,"Linda Howard is one of my favorite authors and I eagerly look forward to her books. I was very disappointed in this book. When I finished I was left with a feeling of ""that's it?"".The development of the characters was very quick and sketchy. The phrases were so similar to other recent books that I wondered what which Howard book was I reading.Don't waste your money on the hardback - wait for the paperback to come out if you're looking for a quick, no involvement read."
2,Failed Attempt,Open Season appears to be a failed attempt at a lighter romantic tone. The herione is such a ditz she set my teeth on edge. This book is far from the quality of suspense/mystery/romance of her last two 5-star efforts.
2,What Happen to Linda Howard?????,"Linda Howard's last two books have really been bad, bad, bad!! And, that's a compliment. What happened, Linda?"
4,WORTH READING,"Well, a lot of people seem to be a bit disappointed in LH's Open Season. Since it is LH, I can't give her anything less than a four because I LOVE her books. It's not as bad as some of the reviews lead you to believe - and it's not as good as a lot of her other books. My only problem with the book was the hero. His initial description/introduction didn't exactly grab me. Usually LH's heros are to die for from the beginning until the end. However, he grew on me and the story had a lot of humor and action. A big plus - no psycho killer. Let's face it. Just about every book you pick up has a psycho killer in it. No it's not as good as Mr. Perfect, but it's worth your time. Once agin LH . . .a western, PLEASE."
3,Enjoyed It - But Lacked Suspense,"I liked Daisy and Jack. The storyline had potential but there was no suspense. I kept waiting for it, but there was none. It was a pretty straightforward book. No sudden twists or turns. The book was cute and the dialogue was funny. I was expecting a little more suspense. All in all, I did enjoy the book."
2,A real disappointment,"I like Linda Howard and have read all her books but Open Season is bad. The book cover reads `Seamlessly blending heart-pounding romance and breathless intrigue'. Seamlessly blending it was not. It took Ms. Howard twelve chapters to remember there was suppose to be some intrigue in this book. And calling it intrigue is really stretching it. The ending was also a disappointment. It's as though Linda Howard knew how bad the book was and just wanted to get is over with. There is no comparison between Mr. Perfect and Open Season. Mr. Perfect I recommend, Open Season - forget it."
3,an overpriced harlequin romance.....,"Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy this, but just couldn't help thinking it belonged as a [price] paperback instead of the hardcover treatment. Incredibly simple book, written on about a fourth grade level, no depth or realism to it. Also, it was incredibly short....large print, and just not worth the $."
2,Love Linda Howard but this isn't her best,"Linda Howard's writing strength is strong, take charge women who take action when faced with adversity. Mr. Perfect was great, it made me laugh out loud and I even read parts of the novel to my husband (who definitely doesn't read romance) but he laughed too. She has written characters who move us quickly through the story and we really care about.In this character, I just couldn't care. She looked to others to solve her problems , someone to do her makeup, someone to answer her questions, and even her mother and Aunt told her it was about ""time"" she did something with herself. I felt the same way. She seemed out of her depth with clothes and just the simple ""girl"" things. It didn't seem like she even had close girlfriends even though she grew up in the town and had never left. I kept wondering if no one else cares why should I."
2,Disapointed...,"Firstly, Linda Howard is my favorite romance writer. Secondly, I was very disapointed with this last book. There was no meat on the bones of the story, everything seemed rushed, almost like an outline was written then words were filled in to connect the dots. I noticed the same trend with Mr. Perfect. Although I liked that one better than Open Season. The characters were okay but not interesting enough or developed enough for me to care about the story. I only hope any future releases are more worth my money."
2,Disappointing,"While I'm a huge Linda Howard fan and have all of her books, I was disappointed with Open Season. The story is unfocused and Howard has all of these tiny subplots that are never developed. For example, the ending has nothing to do with the two main characters; instead, it's another tiny subplot that's just sort of thrown in there. After finishing the book you're left with a feeling of confusion. If you are a Linda Howard fan I would say go ahead and buy the paperback, but it's not worth the money to buy it hardback."
4,daisy meets her match,"Linda Howard does a great job showing both the innocence of Daisy, as well as the strength of her character. Jack makes a good contrast with his background as a SWAT team member. Looking at the relationship between the two, readers will laugh out loud at the way these characters interact. Howard's plot that Daisy unwittingly see's a murder without realizing it fits right in with her character. There are some extrememly funny moments when Daisy and Jack come together. However, while Howard does a good job with the characters and their interaction with each other, the development of the plot isn't as well done as her other novels and the climax was a little disappointing. Despite this, it was still a good novel, intertaining, and for Linda Howard lovers, I definately recommend the novel."
2,All Froth & Bubbles,"This book should have been published by Mills & Boon. Just a romantic supposed ""thriller"" that just doesn't quite make it. It did have some good parts but not enough to save it. Boring, boring and how anyone could give this five stars is beyond me."
2,"Mildly entertaining; over all, disappointing","When I first picked up this book, I thought it would pack the same kick as some of Howard's others; boy was I disappointed. Although it was entertaining to see the machinations of small-town America, the two main characters were so clueless as to be from completely different books. I never got the sense they had much chemistry, and the way the main character went from not liking anything about the man to loving him seemed a little too far-fetched. The plot was also cliche, dating back past all of the thousands of reincarnations of the plot of Pygmalion. All in all, I'd suggest skipping this one and wait for the next Howard book."
1,Dissapointed with Open Season,I was thoroughly dissapointed. This book failed to keep me engaged. The last book I read was Prey and was equally dissapointing but was slightly better than OP. I hope soon Ms Howard will dish out a mind blowing thriller romance as she had done in the past...this one really didn't possess her usual signature.
3,Not the best,"I picked up this book a couple of times before actually buying it. From the blurb on the back, I just wasn't all that interested. But as I had ran out of Howard books to read (recently begun buying them), I decided to buy it. Umm...I was a little disappointed. There is absolutely no suspense. The ""suspense"" factor is weak and kind of lame. If Howard's main focus was on Daisy and Jack, then she could have left the whole women smuggling factor out. But I guess she did need a reason for Jack and Daisy to be forced together. I guess the whole women smuggling plot is just sooo incredibly far-fetched and ill conceived in this book that it comes across as dumb. I'm sorry, but the whole book comes across as dumb. It's a nice quick read, but definitely not Howard's best."
3,Too Cute!,"I expected a little more suspense and was surprised that this was a hardcover. ""A Game of Chance"" had more suspense and a better romance. But this was an amusing read. It definitely moved right along. It seems Linda added a golden retriever since it worked so well for Janet Evanovich but what the heck, it was a nice weekend read. These kinds of books belong in paperback."
2,Good news: Fast read Bad News: Boring,"After this story, I will take Linda Howard off my ""read"" list. This was truly a ridiculous story. Ugly ducking at age 34 turns into swan and falls in love. And along the way, there is a supposedly a mystery going on. Mr Perfect was quite good. Too bad this wasn't also."
5,"Go, Daisy!","I have been a fan of Linda Howard for a long time, even way back during her Silhouette novel years. Open Season is one of the funniest. I highly recommend all her novels. Suspenseful and very romantic."
4,Great Read!!!!!!!!,I laughed and grinned all the way through. These two will stay with me for a long while.
1,Blecccchhh!,"Had the time period for this book taken place in the early 1900's, Daisy's naivete and goody two shoes demeanor could possibly be forgiven but since it was current all I could do was roll my eyes. I could not force myself to go beyond 80 pages before I threw it against the wall...pure drivel. At times the dialog was so corny and silly I squirmed. This was my first Linda Howard book and my last. I am truly amazed that someone actually published this."
5,Terrific!,"Definitely worth the hardback cover price. Jack was a delight, teasing his lady love with a quip or jibe meant to bring a blush or flustered reply. Despite the danger, this is a humorous book. Doesn't every woman want to find a man who loved her for herself before her makeover? And the key questions to test a man's sexual preference was hilarious!"
1,dissapointing,"i really enjoy linda howard i find her books to be witty and entertaining. so when i ordered this book i thought it would be no different, boy was i wrong. there just was not that same passion,and danger. in linda howard books you usually find a mix of love and escalating danger. but in this book a lot of the story was left out. i wont give anything awayso if you decide to read it you can make up your mind, but you can find better books by Mrs. Howard."
1,Disappointing,"I can't believe this is the same author who wrote ""Son of the Morning"", Kill and Tell"" and ""Heart of Fire"". I wish she had spent less time with the make-up tips and gone more deeply into some of the other charcters (especially Todd, Sykes and Jennifer). Do not waste your money on this."
2,Nearly a waste of time!,"This story is a very typical ""makeover and get the guy"" romance. The characters I could have really cared less about and the author spends more time talking about shopping sprees and interior decorating than she does on who these people really are. I was expecting more from Howard, but didn't get it. I recommend this book if you have nothing else left on your bookshelf."
2,no thanks..,"Despite a few moments that were honest-to-god funny or entertaining, overall the suspense aspect of the plot was horribly lame. Not to mention I hate the plot line of makeover makes an otherwise spinster into a beautiful, confident woman.. please spare, me! Like i've said with other books by Linda Howard, this seems to be nowhere in the league of her better books. I will give her that the book has some good parts, but overall I wouldn't recommend it."
3,Goodness!,"I nearly threw the book in frustration if I read the word ""Goodness!"" one more time. I dont know whats going on with Ms Howard, what happened to the standard she set in books like ""After the Night"", ""Shade of Twilight"" and ""Heart of Fire""? It seems as if her books lately are being written so fast that she glosses over the great character development that is usual to her style of writing. However it was an o.k. book so thats why I gave it 3 stars, but if Ms Howard doesnt produce better soon then Im afraid I wont bother buying her again."
3,Mildly Disappointing,"I'm a fairly avid reader and really enjoy books by Jennifer Crusie and Susan Andersen. I thought this book was going to be along the same lines. While it had some occasional humor and mildly steamy scenes, overall it lacked suspense, had several underdeveloped characters and a completely boring ending. I kept waiting for a big climax, but it never happened. This is my first Susan Howard - I may try Mr. Perfect since the reviews seem better, but if that doesn't live up to my other favorites, then good-bye Linda Howard."
4,A pleasant break from her usual scenario,"While Open Season may not have been as suspensful as some of her other books, I found it a pleasant change. The conversant between Jack and Daisy about the colors mauve and puce was hillarious. Also the bits about Daisy learning to apply makeup and dress sexy were funny, any woman should be able to see the humor. I agree that the ending was anti-climactic,however I saw nothing wrong with Sykes taking up with the Jennifer. I read alot of mystery and suspense and perfer strong women in the stories, Howards women are always strong and her men always men you'd want to meet."
3,not a keeper,"Linda Howard can write five star books, but this is not one of them. Did you ever get the feeling that an author was killing time? Howard does in Open Season. I agree with the reviewers who said that this should have been a paperback. I want to like Linda Howard's books, but I will never again buy one of her hardbound books without looking it over very carefully first."
3,it's ok,The songs weren't as up beat as I expected them to be and no one really got into the singing along part. There wasn't that song that played and you knew you just HAD to sing along. I was disappointed because I was looking forward to enjoying this time together as we traveled on vacation.
4,Fun for Adults too.,"I recently went on a road trip with my Mother, two Aunts and an Uncle. At 36 years old I was the baby of the bunch but thought that this book might be humorous to bring for the ride. They were all skeptical when I brought it out of my bag but we ended up having more fun with this than any of the car games we know. Although they joked at first...they have requested that I keep it handy for our next trip. Thanks Car-i-oke!"
3,Slim volume provides a good overview...,"... but does not contain enough detail to be truly useful to someone getting ready to travel to India. About half the book is taken up with geography and history information that is readily available in other sources. Cultural awareness tips are scattered throughout, but I wouldn't feel comfortable heading to the subcontinent armed only with the hints contained here. This book is probably best suited for armchair travelers."
1,Terrible Book,This book left me more confused than when I started. It makes very broad statements about things that may or may not be offensive without taking region or class into account. The book was good for one thing though- I ended up giving it to a friend from Delhi who thought it was good for a laugh.
3,shelled vs shells,I should have gotten the shelled seeds for sprouting - Didn't know better - other wise service etc was great
4,Filled with useful information,This book contains a lot of information that would be helpful to someone serious about the sport. Herding is a great activity for our hyper-active dog and this book helped us get started.
1,violence against dogs,"I have a real problem with the suggestion to training dogs using threats, violence, etc. It seems one could take the time to train a herding dog rather than use the boogie bag."
5,Required for all DOG owners..,"Excellent !! Not only easy reading, and contains great ideas to training your dog. Any dog.. Not for those who want a dog as an object. You want a buddy, friend who is loyal, then this book is required."
4,""" a new vista presents itself ""","This book is a collection of zen essays written by Zenkei Shibayama, abbot of the Nanzenji monastery in Kyoto, Japan. First, there is an introduction by scholar D.T. Suzuki, author of several introductions to zen. From page 141 to page 151 there is a wonderful gallery of paintings which represent patriarchs and masters in the Zen lineage. You can also find the six oxherding pictures and the adjacent explanatory notes. Finally there is the essay A flower does not talk which reminds of a line by Angelus Silesius. Interspersed through these famous stories are wonderful pictures of flower arrangements by Jowa Hirohata. This is a nice book, printed on good paper in comfortable characters.""Everything taking place here is no other than the Buddha-life itself""."
4,Skating competition,"Rival Roommates, by Mellsia Lowell, was very good. I liked how Mellisia wrote about skating, because I love to skate myself.I never have been in a lot of compition with some one else, though."
1,PEEEEE YEEEEW,"The description misleads and represents this ""film"" as a documentary. it's not. at BEST it's a mockumentary...and a BORING one, at that. i love dan butler for living his life openly as a gay actor in hollywood....but i'm sorry to say that this ""film"" shows why he's never a leading man. and his ""life partner"" (as his BF is described in the film...c'mon. it's the 21st century, ""life partner""?) is no better at pretending it's all real, either. big disappointment. :( :( :( i give this ""film"" 3 frowny faces."
5,The Giver: Awesome book!,"The Giver is an awesome book. It took me two days to read it, and when I read a book it usually takes me weeks. Its a great book that always makes you question certain things. It makes you think as your reading. I also think this book is great because it is not made for one certain age group. Anyone from junior high to adults could read this book and still enjoy it.Lastly, the book teaches a good lesson. When you think about it, it shows how much you take advantage of the little ""differences"" in life. If we all of a sudden had to change into the world where the Giver lived, our whole mind set would have to change. Therefore, once I read this book and I thought about what it would be like to be a part of that community, it made me realize how important different things are, even colors."
4,Bristol trip-hop meets Tokyo techno,"I was introduced to the music of Coppe by Guy Guden and his radio program Space Pirate Radio. His show spotlighted her early work, beginning with her CD ""Peppermint."" Coppe's sounds reminded me of a cross between Bjork and Yellow Magic Orchestra. Bristol trip-hop meets Tokyo techno. At least that was my first impression. Coppe mixes many electronic styles from the most fragmented Mouse On Mars blips and squeaks, to dreamy Sakamoto-like ballads. Sort of like Yoko Ono after two martinis. The adventurous will find many musical variations on her latest, ""Papa My Buddha."" The outstanding track of the album being the sensuous yet playful ""Blue."" This one sounded great on the radio and continues to sound tasty on my cd machine. Coppe has cool sounds and cool friends too (like Kris Weston from The Orb). Any of her three discs, ""Peppermint,"" ""Mercury,"" or ""Papa My Buddha,"" is a good place to discover the unique musical world of Coppe."
4,A good book...but I don't know how it got the title 'gothic',"The book itself is absolutely wonderful, and I'd reccomend it to anyone. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the readability (if that's actually a word) is somewhat damaged by the fact that it's a translation from French. I also would warn anybody who is attracted to 'gothic' novels (i.e. The Monk, The Castle of Otranto). It's set in the Middle East and, although there are certain moments of gothic quality horror, over all, the setting somewhat ruined the classification under which it was reccomended to me, and, as any true gothic fan will know, setting is crucial to such novels."
5,comfortable,This is comfortable to hold the weight is fine and it is easy to use on the steel guitar.It looks just like the picture.
3,Steel Guitar slide,"A little heavier that I expected, had to buy a lighter one to learn the steel guitar. Built for for the professional player, I guess."
3,"Too easy, not related to the enclosed DVD","I got this book to learn how to use an exercise ball. It was good for such basic knowledge, but I have to buy another book for more advanced exercises on the ball. This book does have a few exercises that are a bit challenging, but not enough.The best part was the exercise on the the book's cover: draping yourself over the ball. It really helps to expand my spine so that it cures a backache in minutes! Amazing but true!There's a DVD in the back of the book. Those exercises are even more easy than the ones in the book. If you want really easy exercises (why do them?), this is the book and DVD for you."
5,Always amazing sounds,"Maybe the best arpist in the world, playing outstanding performances either jazz standards, african grooves, or any other style. She is the one to look for. Always amazing, a diferent aproach If you love music you must give her an oportunity."
2,they need pac back,"This cd is trash, im not tryin 2 be a hata, but they got like 2 good tracks on the whole joint. The beats an production is pretty good, but the rhymes are jus horrible. I mean they were ok with pac, cuz they kinda complimented his style, but now there jus a pain 2 listen 2"
3,2 PAC MADE THE OUTLAWZ REMEMBER THAT !,"THE OUTLAWZ WERE ON 2 PACS ALBUM ""STILL I RISE"" BUT NO THE OUTLAWZ CAN'T SHOW LOVE AND PUT 2 PAC ON THEY'RE ALBUM.THE OULAWZ ARE SHADY FOR THAT.MAYBE THEY WANTED TO PUT A ALBUM OUT WITHOUT 2 PAC CAUSE THEY WANTED TO PROVE SOMETHING,BUT STILL THAT ISN'T NO LOVE TOWARD MAKAVELI.2 PAC MADE THE OUTLAWZ AND NOW BY COMING OUT WITH THIS ALBUM THEY THROW IT RIGHT BACK IN 2 PACS FACE.THEY WAR WASN'T NEVER ABOUT EAST AND WEST IT WAS ABOUT WEST VS WEST AND THE OUTLAWZ ARE A BIT SHADY.DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM NO PAC NO HIT."
4,"Even Without Makaveli, Tha Outlawz Light it Up","My favorite gangsta-rap album is ""The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory"" by Tupac ""Makaveli"" Shakur.Naturally, I would enjoy ""Ride Wit' Us or Collide Wit' Us"" by Tha Outlawz. I only paid 1 cent (and shipping and handling charges), but I would be willing to pay 12 dollars for this album. The price for this album is right. You'll pay more for shipping and handling.The beats blast hard, the music is funky, and the lyrics are phat. We all miss Tupac...but Tha Outlawz pick up the Game right where Pac left it. And like Tupac's music, this album is thought-provoking, hard-hitting, and pure gangsta. Pac lives on in the post-mortal existence and Tha Outlawz keep it real here in our world.Give this album a spin; you will not regret your purchase.Peace out."
4,One of The Great Ones,"Have the Outlawz fallen off?? Hell No!! And this album proves that it doesnt take a big bank roll and mainstream producers to make a great album. Stepping on to the rap scene with their first album the outlawz have showed us that Tupac does not make rappers that fall off.This album is one of the great ones there are very few rappers who can capture the true feelings of growing up hard and the outlawz are those kind of rappers from songs like ""Life is What U Make It"" to ""Black Rain"" to ""Nobody Cares"" the outlawz have taken tupacs story telling and made it their own. Out of all 16 songs on the album there are 14 songs that are a must to have for any one looking for the ""Glory Days"" when tupac was still a rapper.For some one who is just buying into rap or is not an outlawz fan than this album is only half as good giving a 3 of 5 stars but to some one who knows about rap and has followed it for a while this album is a must have OUTLAW FAN OR NOT!!"
3,Lacking without 2pac,"Without 2pac in the outlaw lineup, the Outlaw Immortal cd 'Ride wit us, or Collide wit us"" isnt what it could of been... Anybody who isnt a diehard Pac fan, or Outlaw fan, prolly wouldnt enjoy this CD... There are a few tracks on here that are cool, prolly most of all Outlaw 2000, but it is still an Outlaw Immortalz CD, and anyone who is a fan, should get it..."
1,What Is This?,"Their only asset is that the were affiliated with the fallen legend Pac. If you are willing to buy an album based on that, do so, If you are looking for a dope album, look elsewhere. If with Pac, these guys... How many albums can you make about killing people? I know that this is entertainment, but even Stallone and makes a different type of move every once and a while. ""Smash"" is the only song that I like because BadAzz and Fetty Chico(if you are a fan, you know who this is)are in it."
5,ride with us,"Since pac died 4 years ago, the Outlawz have been putting it down on the low doing their own thing seperatly. AlthOugh there were originally 9 Outlawz(Makaveli,Kadafi,Fatal,Napoleon,Young Noble,E.D.I Min, Castro,Storm,Mussalini). There are only 4(Napolean,Young Noble,Castro,E.D.I. Min) on this album. THey put it down as if there were 30 of dem. Being trained by the greatest rapper of all time(2pac) has put these ... on anther level.Outlaw Immortalz is STILL BALLIN.This album is the begining of big things."
3,"Outlawz, what happened","I have been waiting for this album since the release of still i rise, and honestly i am very disappointed. The tracks seem rushed and the lawz have lost their originality. I think it's worth listening to but not worth paying for"
1,Don't buy Tasco 4x30 binoculars,"These are actually Opera Glasses not binoculars, do not have a roof prizm and have a narrow field rather wide as described. The field of view is narrow and optical quality of image is very poor.Probably the older model of this binocular was as described and the Chinese manufacturer cheapened it, keeping the same external look and description. These should be considered a child's toy, not a useful binocular.This same item is sold under both Tasco and Bushnell, and in either case is not worth buying."
2,HO-HUM REPEAT REPEAT REPEAT,"I read this book hoping it would be interesting, and for the first chapter it was, but it was the following chapters that bored me to death, the reason I say this is due to the fact that every chapter is a repeat of the previous chapter, you learn how Tim did things his way over and over and over again. Fortunately, this book did leave out for the most part, the I love Faith, I love Faith syndrome that Tim has been going through over the past. The book is a nice have if you want it just to have it, if you're looking for a good read on country music, try one of the older books on Waylon, Willie, Merle, or anyone that has actually had something to say."
5,Tim McGraw is Incredible!,"Tim McGraw is such a classy guy. He only pics the best song for his albums and for his fans to listen to. He doesn't just pic 10 or 12 songs to fill up a CD. He makes sure they are quality songs, that what I love about him so much. There is not one bad song on any of his cd's, all of them are quality. This book isn't bad either! I'll see you in Vegas in may TIM!!!Brandon"
3,Nice book.,I bought this book as a gift for my Mom and she has really enjoyed it. I glanced through it and thought that it was a fairly nice book. Lots of pictures and interesting information about Tim and his band.
3,Michael Perry gets it right.,"I enjoyed reading Poulation: 485 by Michael Perry. I have been a paramedic for 25 years and thought it would be interesting to read aout rural EMS in Wisconsin. Michael Perry showed me that many EMS experiences are universal. This book is for the thinking EMT or paramedic who wants a good read.I personally liked the chapter where Michael described treating a trauma patient and waiting for the helicopter as ""kneeling in the dirt and lookiing to the heaven's."" Very deep. A book worth reading if you are a student of life and EMS."
4,Great stories and fun writing,"Michael Perry has a great way of explaining and writing the simple things. When I read his books it feels like we are sitting around the kitchen table listening to the day's events. It just happens that Perry is better at getting those stories across than most of us. There were times in this book that I felt he had expanded his story a little far to places I didn't need to go to understand his meaning, but I knew right around the corner there would be something that would have my full attention. I was surprised by the sad ending and loved it."
4,"For the most part, this is a pleasure to read.","I wish that I could share all of the enthusiasm of the other commentators on this page. While I found 2/3rds of the book to be simply wonderful, I did feel that the final third dragged just a bit--and tended to repeat themes already covered. But even that part is saved by the stunning essay entitled ""Sarah."" Like many of the other commentators, I, too, grew up in a community very much like New Auburn--although in Massachusetts. We, too, have a volunteer fire department and a chief of police who had a day job. Many of the people in this book are known to you if you ever have lived in such a place. By all means take the time to read this book. I just wanted to add my caution in the midst of all of this rampant enthusiam."
3,Fun anecdotes and instructional about EMS/Fire Rescue,Good anecdotes sometimes funny sometimes thoughtful sometimes shockingWonderful writing I enjoyed looking up so many words!Light enough reading to enjoy in small chunks as well...
5,Beautiful!,"This is a beautiful book. When you consider the subject matter, the tragedies of everyday life in a small town, this book risked being dark and depressing. I found it to be quite the opposite. Mike Perry finds the grace that can come from senseless accidents. Buy multiple copies and start handing them out to your friends.(I already wrote a review of this book but it never got posted, so if it ever turns up, I apologize for repeating myself.)"
3,A bit pretentious,"OK, I know, no one will find this review 'helpful' because it is not glowing :) But it is honest. I suppose I expected a little more emergency medicine and a little less prose and deep thoughts, although I know it is the juxtaposition of the two elements that is a unique and sometimes attractive feature about Perry's writing. I just found the work a wee bit too ""rhapsodic"" to quote the author. Perry can turn a phrase but his homilies about life wear you out after a while. If a major dilemma in his life is that he cannot justify his simple roots (replete with ""aw shucks"" phrases) with his more heady literary aspirations, neither could I. Sorry, I really, really wanted to like this book!"
2,BORING!,"Personally this book is not for my liking! It jumps all over the place, is not even a story just bits and pieces of this an that, and has no character to it!"
2,Just Read The Last Chapter,I was hoping to find some real insight into small town living. What i got was a long winded version of a story that could have been better expressed as a short story.I recommend reading the last chapter and skipping the rest.
2,Truck much better,"He's got talent as a writer BUT dead people, puke, and sappy back-where-I-belong speeches didn't do it for me."
3,No new ideas here,"Nice and glossy book, but I didn't get any new ideas out of it. I'm not going to give it a poor rating just for that reason. It's a very 'pretty' book, and others might find it inspirational."
1,.NOT MY TYPE OF COTTAGE DESIGN,"This book was very disappointing. I am donating it to the library. It is very rustic, not romantic cottage. Good for people in Maine. I guess this type cottage design is one I am not familiar with nor do I like it."
1,Do not order this product - out about $12.51 out of pocket return shipping for inferior product,The picture appears to show leather at the area where the boot meets with the wood. This product does not have any leather to protect the boot when removing boots. When I contacted Amazon the representative issued a refund and a return shipping label. Major problem was that the shipping label was not postage paid so it cost me $12.51 out of pocket in shipping costs for the wrong product to have been sent to me upon returning the product. I am not a happy customer after having to pay for a product return that was not a described or appeared in the photo of the product.
4,Works well,I would recommend this product! It has worked well for me. I would recommend this product! It has worked well for me.
5,Muddy boot problem solved,"It is not a very glamourous product but it does the job. Simple and well built, this product has been better than the plastic ones I have owned before. It was money well spent on a product that most people do not give much thought to, except when the boots are muddy or covered with snow."
1,Ripoff,This baby shoe thing will never fit an aldult. TAKE IT OFF THE MARKET. i WOULD HAVE SENT IT BACK BUT IT'S NOT WORTH THE POSTAGE!!!!!!
4,great for boots,great little product but i suggest you glue some leather to the area that grabs the boots to prevent any possible scuffing
2,CHEAP,For the price I was expecting more than just staple construction. This looks cheap and certainly wont last very long.
1,May scratch your boots,"Received the item as described. The problems began when we started using this. Unbeknownst to me, the stapling that holds the leather material around the insides sides apparently had not been stapled properly or been done at an incorrect angle. The sharp staple end came out through the other side. The end had not pierced completely through the leather material, it was only once we began using the jack did it completely show itself. I now have boots that have numerous cuts in them because I did not notice this issue soon enough.Beware. I would recommend running your finger across any surface your boots will be in contact with before using."
2,Disappointed in this item,"When I first tried this boot jack, I thought I must have been sent one for youth or small women's boots. The opening is too small for my ""B"" width boot heal to fit into for a good grip. I have tried to use it a few times and have decided to write it off as a bad purchase. The leather in the opening seems to be attached well but the rubber grip on the top is attached with staples, giving it a cheap look."
1,Not for adult boots,This jack must be made for children because it does not fit an adult boot. Would have returned it but it was not worth the return postage. Very disappointed !
1,Beware!!!!!!! Damage to your boots may result!,I've had this boot jack less than three months. I use it maybe three days a week. In that time a staple has managed to work it's way through the leather padding and has scrathed a (relatively) new pair of boots BEYOND REPAIR!!!!! Be sure to inspect this item before use EVERY TIME! I am so disappointed with this product and with Amazon! I'd give it less than one star if I could.
2,Poor value for money,"This is a paper thin book that is supposed to cover 25 years of Seattle baseball. This practically means it devotes a whole (small) page to each year. There is very little detailed content and not many photos. For the price you pay, it certainly isn't worth it."
2,had to rework it to get it to work,had to do allot of rework on it to get it to work but after some time I got it to work
5,It fits.,I have a 2000 Celica and it fits well. I had no problems installing it. I just need 5 more words.
3,Worked with some heavy modification,Not sure what everyone was saying with perfect fitting. Yeah it closes the gap between the head unit and the dash (waterfall) deal but there's definitely some modding required.
3,"Gets the job done, but not a perfect fit","2006 Toyota Tundra AccessCab SR5The instructions are clear and helpful. You have to cut off some tabs--you can do it with a pair of side-cutters or a dremmel tool. Once installed, it closed the gaps on the side pretty well, but still left a little bit open. If you look from certain angles, you can see past it into the dash at all of the wires/plactic console structure that's behind the radio. Worth the money, but could have closed the gap better. I don't know if it's the size of the double-DIN JVC radio, the opening in the dash, or this kit that's the real issue. Regardless, it was CLOSE, but not exactly what I was hoping for."
2,Where is my hardware?,You'd think since the pieces are small and have to hold a big radio they wouldn't be so flimsy. I'd also like to know where my hardware is.
5,It works! 2011 Scion tC,"I have a 2011 Scion tC. You need to remove the stock metal bracket from the stock radio, and screw that onto both this plastic trim, and the new aftermarket radio. You will need to also modify the plastic brackets by breaking off a piece of the bracket that is hidden inside the dash anyway. It describes this in the instructions.Again, this works find in the 2011 Scion tC."
5,Exactly what it looks like,"It's exactly what it looks like. Standard plastic, holes line up right, no problems. Used on a '09 Scion xB."
4,Good book but no aerial combat,"I did enjoy the book but was disapointed to find not a single bit of aerial combat. I was of the impression that the F16 was an air superiority fighter, a roll it was not used for at all in the Gulf War. The technical details are good but the story becomes repetative half way through."
2,big letdown for big event,"There was 8 matches total with a decent card. Steve Austin vs. Undertaker vs. Triple H, Shane McMahon vs. X-Pac, Nicole Bass vs. tori, Mankind vs. Billy Gunn, The Brood vs. The Acolytes & Viscera, Kane vs. Mideon, Gillberg vs. Tiger Ali singh and Droz vs. Steve Blackman. No titles changed hands and the outcomes to all the matches were dumb. England was very disapointed with the WWF. Do not buy this video it's not worth the money."
2,not very good,the only matches that were good were the followingAustin vs.undertaker vs. hhhbilly gunn vs. mankindthe rest were all snores and bores
2,2 words....THIS SUCKS,"No Mercy was a pretty crap event, although all the UK one's are. There are only a few decent matches on the card. If you buy this, you may as well skip the first hour and a half because it is crap."
4,Another great addition to any ppv collection,"Some great moments on this tape. Stone Cold and X-Pac beating up HHH and Chyna, Mankind vs. Billy Gunn and Sable's last WWF PPV appearence"
5,Another World,This richly and handsomly photographed film cast light (some) on the mysterious business of Burgess and McLean and their entirely improbable defection from Britain.Ward Stewart
5,Underseen and very good,"The Bottom Line:This stellar film adaptation of Julian Mitchell's play theorizes that the overwhelming snobbery, hypocrisy, and cold-blooded elitism that fueled British public schools directly led to ""the Cambridge Five"" betraying British secrets to the Soviet Union; totally involving and displaying a rare grasp of character, Another Country is a film to make 90 minutes for.3.5/4"
4,I wish it had subtitles,"What with my bad hearing and the way the English speak, I was hoping the DVD would have subtitles in English. The only subtitles are in French. Lovely movie nonetheless."
4,This Ain't Hogwarts,"Alas, poor Rupert Everett: he's so hopelessly good-looking that he makes people forget he's actually a fine actor. In this British boarding school drama, he gets to ponder the meaning of his privileged life. In the secret world of school prefects and gods, everyone dallies in same-sex relationships, yet assumes they'll go on to respectable marriages. Not Guy Bennett (Everett), though - he's hopelessly in love with a recently-graduated former classmate. He risks his future for his ideals of sexual equality, but finds some measure of acceptance from his ardently Communist best friend, Tommy Judd (played by a young Colin Firth). (It raises an interesting question: are Communists born that way?) The acting is good, and I applaud the movie's message."
5,I like this film,"I've appreciated this film for years, in part because it finally let me see into the British public school system a little bit more clearly than before. I think it's well done and not too offensive except for people easily offended who really deserve a lot more offense than this will give them."
5,Depressing in a pleasant way,"My favourite scene is when Guy Bennet tried to talk Tommy Judd into being one of those high-rank lads. Colin's Tommy was immersed in soft moonlight, leaning against the wall, looking sadly out of the window, telling Guy his disappointment and anger. The cinematography is fantastic, very touching.Now I can understand why there were so many youngsters in early 20th century going for communism. Communism fits their ideal for a better, fairer society and the enthusiasm born with youth fires up the desire.I simply love it."
3,OK but dated and slow,"If your just wanting to enlarge your gay dramas, then by all means purchase this DVD. If you fall asleep easly - you will never get thru this movie."
2,"Another Country, Another Movie","I was bored to tears!!! This is a real lackluster movie. Dialogue poor, cinematography ordinary and the acting boring. Believe me, you can't wait to see this sleeper....yawn!F.PoeNYC"
4,Perfect Casting!,"Often when a detective story is translated to a TV series, it's fans are left scratching their heads because the main character doesn't fill the vision one has of his demeanor and looks. Not true of the Montalbano character: Central Casting did their job, in my opinion. An ever so subtle strut, bemused shrug, patient stare: our Camillieri character fits it to a T!!Not so of the characters in the Rebus series, nor the chap who plays Inspector Banks ..in fact, there is even an overweight and sullen Wallander who has no redeeming features.So thanks to the Italians for getting it right (ZEN is perfect, too!)"
5,Authentic DVD Versions of the Books,"Having read all of the translated versions of the Montalbano series, and knowing that there were movies of the stories shown on RAI, it was great to finally have the DVDs available in western format. After viewing the first three stories, it was well worth the wait--the cast is perfect and the scripts do complete justice to Mr. Camilleri's writing. Now we're looking forward to seeing the full set of the DVDs. Highly recommend them to Inspector Montalbano's many fans."
5,What? Only Five Stars allowed? Short changes the Series.,"Acting, story, direction, production values, location, casting, EVERYTHING.Freaking EVERYTHING about this entire series is wonderful. Entertaining andfun. One of the best purchases I have made this year.I have ALL of the entire collection of this series and there has not been one moment thathas disapointed. The most satisfying TV series that I have seen in a very long time. Wwhich does not mean that others are poor, justthat Montalbano is superior in every manner.Five Star? Make it Ten."
4,"No Pain installation, works perfectly","This is a perfect unit as part of your home wireless system. This was the easiest install I had in a long time. I purchased this card together with 3Com wireless OfficeConnect Gateway. The installation process took less than 10 minutes.Positives;- Very easy install- Low packet loss- Works well in brick house with many interfering signals (Microwave, cabling...)Not so good:- Thirsty. Using the PC Card with my laptop made my battery life decrease by 50% (worse than even a normal modem)- Short product support (30 days...)- Range not so good."
4,Proud to display this on my porch!,I love having this on my porch to display my pride of serving my country. Anyone that comes to my home sees it and knows we are a military family. The only issue I have with this product is that the white area chips/peels off. It didn't last but a couple of months before it started coming off from average weather conditions.
3,"OK, but...","I am a Parrothead, I like this album, it is fun, but I have to be honest. The lesser known songs make this record. But I have to agree with reviewers who say that his vocal style is becoming a bit tepid. His version of 'Southern Cross' musically is excellant, but his overly lazy vocals just bring the song down. This, by a man who sings for a living every summer. I was listening to JB's ""Son of a Son of a Sailor"" the other day and man what a difference in the singing. These are supposed to be entertaining songs for the fans, but the ho-hum, la-te-da vocal treatment makes me think he is tiring of the job. It's not like Bob Dylan whose singing is terrible but delivers a powerful message through his songwriting. Here, we get music as a source of escapism and blase', almost karaoke like, singing.All in all, the album is entertaining. But I am finding more and more that knockoff bands he inspired are doing a much better job with his songs (i.e. - Texas band named Key west)."
3,Disappointed,"Although some ""classics"" are revisited (Tin Cup Chalice, Tryin' to Reason), this cd is compiled of the same worn out tunes that we hear at every concert. When is he going to put ""Makin' Music for Money"" or ""Brahma Fear"" or ""Manana"" in a set list, much less on a live album? These songs are great, and they take us all to that special place in our minds, but he has so many other songs that deserve recognition and are better than hearing ""Fins"" and ""Cheeseburger in Paradise"" for the millionth time."
4,"GOOD MUSIC ON THIS ONE, BUT THE ENHANCED VIDEO IS...","This CD contains good Buffett music. I especially thought that ""Southern Cross"" was a great addition to the album. I have no problem with the music. It was classic Buffett, with some new songs(Southern Cross and Brown Eyed Girl) thrown in as a bonus. HOWEVER, I did have a problem watching the enhanced video that is on this CD. It was hard to pull up, and then was not of good quality. It is hosted by Savannah Jane Buffett, which is interesting, but the picture quality was not great. Maybe this was just a problem with my copy of the tape. The music on this one was good. I just wish I could have seen Savannah Jane a little better. :)"
5,Amazing!,"Jimmy Buffet makes music that no ear should not be familiar with. Especially this cd has such a variety of music and is filled with Jimmy's best hits. I highly recommend this cd for any kime of listener. You will laugh, you will cry, you will want to party. Trust me, this cd, is the one that goes on in the middle of the party, which makes the party awesome! A must get for any college student and even adult."
4,JIMMY JIMMY JIMMY!,"How can you ignore the genius in Buffett's lyrics? If you are a fan of the ""old"" Buffett, the man who brought beaches and oceans and the simple joy of living to life in every single line he wrote, you will enjoy this CD. It is true that alot of Buffett's new CDs have strayed from that theme. However, in ""Tuesdays Thursdays and Saturdays"" you can once again catch a glimpse of the old Buffett. His exceptional live version of Tin Cup Chalice brought tears to my eyes. So my advice to you is ""to get that Packard runnin'"" and buy the CD."
5,TUESDAYS-THURSDAYS-SATURDAYS,"What can I say? Jimmy Buffett had done it again. Tuesdays- Thursdays- Saturdays is Jimmy's first release from his new home at Mailboat Records. This new live album has many of his popular parrothead party hits, such as Margaritaville, Come Monday, Cheeseburger in Paradise, and Son of a Son of a Sailor. It also has many hits that only true fans would know like Tin Cup Chalice, Tryin to Reason with Hurrican Season, and Love and Luck. This album covers all of the basis with a never released Jimmy Buffett track called Southern Cross, originally recorded and written by Crosby, Stills, and Nash. This album is definitely for anyone who needs an escape and for any Jimmy Buffett fan around."
2,Don't Buy This One....Buy Feeding Frenzy....It's the Same,"As a devoted Jimmy Buffett fan, I must purchase every one of his CDs. It's a craving I can't control, even If I tried. However, I'm very disappointed in this record for the fact that it is like all of his other live recordings. He used the same songs again and again. His live recordings of Come Monday, Pencil Thin Mustashe, and the like are vertually identical to the other recordings. How many versions of the live songs do you want me to own? Jimmy, please, I beg of you, produce an ""unpluged"" CD of your old music. This would truly make all things right with the world."
4,For all the Parrotheads,Nothing new here except Great Jimmy Buffet! The enhanced CD gives the feeling of being there.
5,Thanks Jimmy,"As a Parrothead who had to miss my yearly concert, I'd like to say that this album almost makes up for it. There were a couple of older hard to find numbers on there as well as the Buffet standards which I could hear live on on every single album and never tire of. I also like the mulitimedia backstage look provided to fans. Once again Buffet comes through."
3,"this is a fun cd, but.................","if you are a parrot head, buy this cd, it is Jimmy Buffett. But don't expect to find the album to be as good as the classic ""You Had To Be There"" or as good as ""Feeding Frenzy"" which I still think is one of the best live albums ever."
5,Jimmy's The best.,"Jimmy's Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday cd is just as great as the concert tour by the same name. He is the best performer I have seen in a long time. I can't wait until his next cd comes out."
1,"Jimmy ""McBuffett""","Do we really need this? As an Australian, where the ""new"" album retails for $29.95 and where Buffett has not deemed worth touring since 1987 it is hard to see any value in this release at all. If you own any of his previous live albums, save your money. Sub standard vocals, re-re-hashed content and all would be forgiven except that he murders one of the great sailing songs, ""Southern Cross"". It sure is disappointing condsidering the quality of ""Beach House On The Moon"". ""Feeding Frenzy"" would be a much better album for those who need to have a live Buffett album or better still, any of his studio efforts."
5,Parrothead,"This is a must-have CD for those Buffett fans who have been along since the begining. Also a great CD for someone looking for a nice (live) compilation. Overall, Buffett at his best...LIVE!"
3,Too much like Feeding Frenzy,"I have been a Buffet fan since he sang free on the lawn outside the Reitz Union at Univ of Fla -- more than once, I might add. I have seen him several times in concerts over the years and he is the ultimate entertainer. My kids are now avid listeners to all my old (gasp) albums. I had to update to CD's for them. This CD has much of the same songs as Feeding Frenzy or You Had to Be There. With the exception of Tin Cup Chalice (one of my all time faves), Hurricane Season, and a couple more, the selections were the same old same old. I would like to see him record a Live CD by himself -- just Jimmy and his guitar. Add a few of his newer songs, i.e. Happily Ever After, a few oldies but goodies, i.e. Cowboy in the Jungle, and a few more popular selections and you've got a nice mix of Jimmy. He puts on a great show alone and it would be a nice addition to his collection."
4,Good For Jimmy,"Wow. I have avoided writing a review of Jimmy's music for a long time, although I have really wanted to write one. Yes, I am a Parrothead. To be honest, this CD is a very fair representation of a Jimmy Buffett concert. The band is tight, and Jimmy is in great form, as usual. Some of the highlights are Southern Cross, which is unbelievable, Pencil Thin Mustache, and Tin Cup Chalice. He dedicated this CD to the Parrotheads, and he did not dissapoint. I felt as if Jimmy was going to burst through my front door while listening to this CD. Jimmy writes his liner notes from Nantucket, as he is no doubt there for the ""Fall Run"" of striped bass and bluefish. I hope he caught some. Just a note- If Changes In Lattitudes, Changes In Attitudes was on this CD, I would have given it five stars."
5,Awesome,"Extremely satisfied!!! Absolutely the very last bag you will ever need!!!! Which unfortunately for me means I have to have more of these awesome KATA bags. I an a civil engineer, constantly on the move. I travel from office to field, to gym to grad school, everyday! Sometimes on foot, sometimes on a bike, sometimes on public transport. I have to carry my laptop, mp3 player, cellphone, extra clothes, food... and some other stuff... I have been looking for this bag all my life. If you have several ""worlds"" to juggle. This is the bag for you."
4,Laptop/Mp3 Player/Phone Compartments,"I'm very happy with this product, and think anyone interested in a multi use camera bag will be quite happy with it. Based on the other reviews, I wanted to share that I am able to fit my 15"" macbook pro in the laptop slot. It's quite snug, and it takes some pushing and what not to zip around the top corners, but it fits. Also the phone and mp3 player compartments locatd on the front of hte straps are too small for any phone I've ever had. The neoprene is too snug, and and unless you one of those bean shaped mp3 players its going to be a tough fit...and by tought i mean nearly impossible. Having said that, buy this bag. It's great. It also fits very snugly, almost like a Gregory backpacking bag - without the size. The neoprene is not ideal for venting back heat though."
3,"Excellent bag, but shoulder straps could be better","I recently purchased this bag to become my day-to-day backpack, so that I could carry laptop and DSLR confortably and securely.It fits amazingly on the bag, very secure and confortable. I walk a lot with it and I don't even feel it's there! There's tons of space and the divisions are wonderful, you can put anything you want in there, because everything is pretty much customizable.The only thing I wish they'd rethink are the shoulder straps. They're too wide to allow me to cross my arms, for example (something I do a lot while waiting on traffic lights). They're also very rigid, so it's very difficult to put any kind of mobile or mp3 player on these pockets and retrieve it quickly -- I broke a fingernail trying to remove my mobile from it.All in all, a great bag, but the shoulder pockets have been inutilized."
4,Nice Bag!,"This bag has all the room I need for packing light. It will hold my xTI body and a couple of extra lenses. The ""top"" portion of the bag has space for memory cards/sticks, which is nice. I really enjoy the bright yellow interior, it helps you acquire items quickly. The camera stays snug with the velcro / elastic strapping system.I would have given the bag 5 stars, but unless you have a macbook (13""), its probably going to be a tight fit getting your laptop in there. I also would have liked for the material against the back to not been neoprene, or at least have some moisture wicking properties. The bag gets a little hot on your back, especially if your hiking."
5,It fits,"When I was considering buying this bag I could not find out anywhere if my laptop would fit. Now I am happy to report that both my T61 14.1 widescreen with the 4 cell battery and my wife's Dell D620 with the standard battery fit. The fit is a little snug, but since Kata's material is stretchy, it feels almost custom-made and very secure. Proved to be a PERFECT airplane carry-on for a short trip with a laptop, DSLR and a digicam."
5,Kata sensitivity V Backpack,"This back pack is awesome. Looks great, funtions very well, much more room than in there than I imagined. Very happy with my purchase!"
2,Attravtive but poor construction and flawed.,"On the face of it this bag is well designed and appealing. Very light-weight, comfortable (despite no waist-band) and ergonomic. However, it is not built to last. Within a year, of frequent (but not unduly heavy) use, the fabric ripped all around the upper zips, rendering it useless. I've used Lowepro for years before this and nearly all the bags are still going strong - entirely different quality construction (though even one of the zips has gone on the cheaper one of these).On another note, having pictures of recommended contents (laptop, camera, phone, ipad etc.) on the outside may look funky and fun, but it also acts as a red-light to muggers and thieves (I live in Nairobi, Kenya - I know).Don't buy if longevity is a requirement."
5,Great Little Bag,"This is a cool little bag. It fits my 13"" Mac Book Pro perfectly. It has plenty of space to store my Sony HDR-SR500V Camcorder and my Canon Rebel with an extra lens, filters and batteries. The best part is that it's really compact. Even with all that space it's not bulky to carry around."
5,"Best camera, computer bag I have ever seen","My wife loves this bag, it holds her MacBook and our Nikon D70 with lens and accessories."
5,love it,"It took a little time to get use to how small it was inside. I took out the divider in the middle, and it made a lot of space. Every one comments on how cool it looks."
5,Small and spacious,"This backpack is small. The only time this is a bad thing is when you try to stuff too much in.If you can understand its size limits (no encyclopedias) you will love it.The laptop section is well protected. A spiral notebook can fit in there, too. The camera holder is great.The weight distribution is nice, although I have not worn it for longer than half an hour, yet. The clip in the front helps bring the weight across the shoulders and chest. No bouncing or loose straps here.You will definitely impress people with this. Yeah I know trying to impress people is morally reprehensible, but get a grip. This backpack will make people jealous.The top handle is very nicely padded. You could carry it across an airport just by the top handle. I got it wet tonight and there were no problems. I did not go to a water park, but the rain just beaded up and either rolled off or evaporated."
3,"""If you remember the 70's...""","""...you probably weren't there!""Seriously, this book is an interesting window into a time, post-Watergate, post-Vietnam, when many people were looking into all kinds of alternative ways of thinking, of feeling, of living.Don't be swayed one way or another by the ""reviews"" posted by members of a Hate Group. The message Maharaji brought when he was 13 is the same message he brings now: ""What you are looking for is within you."""
3,Interesting patterns but...............................,"Nice hardcover book, with colorful illustrations however be sure that you understand that they are Paper Foundation Quilting patterns not regular pieced blocks."
4,Nice Curtains.,The description is acurate. It clearly states 42x84. I think these are good curtains for the price and will work nicely for me. They are getting a bum rap!
1,Signature Satin Curtains,"Stain marks on new cutains, water stains! Plus a large white spot with no color. I washed them according to directions, and the stains still remained as did the large white spot. To me they look like a ""return"" and they ""resold them as is"" to me. It's sad. Won't purchase again."
3,SIGNATURE SATIN CURTAINS,"I bought this item for my wife,I agree with costmer Judy Paker.The discription is miss leading.I to now need to buy 2 more for my wife,but now they are out of stock.Now what? Denver Young."
1,Poor reproduction.,"This disk needs higher technology clean-up to be enjoyable. Too many scratches, hisses and static."
2,not too thrilled,"While it's nice to protect the LCD, the lack of the ability to add a eyepiece extension makes it more annoying than useful. Your face is pressed against it more when you try to use the eyepiece and the LCD screen has to be closed to use it. I only use this to protect the LCD during transport now and switch to my eye extender for actual use."
4,Great accessory,"I purchased this product and am certainly not sorry. It is wonderful protection for the LCD screen if you camera is in a bag where it can be scratched. In bright sunlight, the ""shade"", when flipped up reduces glare significantly. The installation is a snap and ease of operation is another plus!"
2,Enough?,Enough? Bill McKibbon's had ENOUGH of the biotechnology revolution? He hasn't seen anything yet. The best is yet to be imagined...
3,Entertaining look from old Brooklyn Dodger emplyee,I got the book for a glimpse at the Dodger organization froman insider's look.Irving comes through with many amusing stories.
2,CZ stone fell out after 1 week,"Cute and cheap - you get what you pay for but only for a week. Because that's how long it takes before the stone falls out of the stud. You probably won't notice at first that you're walking around wearing 1 earring that looks like you found it in a dumpster. Not impressed, but I've accepted it and moved on. Clearly."
2,Hear My Brain a Cr -u - umblin',"Jean Paul is a very fine guitarist but he should never have released this. From some place too close to the Planet Jazzrock, JP has bravely, (i.e avoiding Experience material in the main), set off towards Jimi's blues planet and quite simply overshot. He has missed the point, (not lost the plot, just never found it), and failed badly and sadly to sense what he should have been seeking and would not have needed to seek had he, perhaps innately, understood the blues origins of Jimi's music. What a bitter disappointment this recording is. Only Will Newman's Little Sister, Indigenous, Stevie Ray and a very few others can do the right thing with Jimi's music."
4,"Kiss, Bow, or Shake Hands",As a Realtor dealing with International Customers I found this book very helpful. It is well worth its price.
4,International Businesses,An interesting book for those in the international business field. Specially if you are going to a new country to develop a business...
4,A great resource for business travelers,This was a recommendation and I have found it to be very helpful. Use it as a general reference only but it is nice to have a little insight to the different cultures.
4,"Recommended, but take it with a pinch of salt!","Having to work with various cultures this book offered something I could put to use right away. But this is not a book you read cover-2cover. Rather its a on-the-table reference to be consulted from time to time. I read of couple of chapters on peoples that I interact with. Very useful for someone traveling to a new country for the first time. Or so I thought, until I read the portion on India. While most observations seem OK, the naming convention of Indian Muslims caught my attention. While most Muslim names used in India are derived from Arabic, I haven't seen anyone named or using 'bin' or 'binti' as in the Arab world. So my 2 cents - read it, but do check the facts before you tout about your cultural knowledge in a client meeting. But I like the analysis of cultural orientation with cognitive styles and negotiation strategies. That makes it a useful read than the average tips you can find on internet"
2,"OK, so I should have looked closer.","The ratings for this book are extremely high, but to get all 60 or so countries in, there seems to be little info about each country. I expected much more depth and the countries, Afghanistan and Iran, where not in there. Of course I see that they are now in another version of this book. Too bad I did not figure that out before ordering. Oh well!"
2,Country-surfing can hurt,"Not a bad idea, but this kind of superficial info can hurt you as much as it can help you - maybe a regional focus would be good?"
3,"Kiss, bow or handshakes",the book serves as a source of information for leadership and managers in global perspective
5,A Quick Reference on Cross Cultural Sensitivities,"I run leadership programs for high potential Fortune 500 women in NYC, Boston and NJ and I meet so many talented men and women from Eastern Europe, Europe, South America, Asia, South America and even Iceland. This book gives me a quick reference on business culture, mores, traditions and social culture. I know these get out of date quickly but it's sure better than not knowing and allows you to be more responsive."
5,Essential book if you work with people from other Countries,"Fantastic book, I've been referring to this for nearly 10 years now since it first came out. Working as I do with many different cultures, and given the track record of my American Colleagues who don't know where Canada is (joke!) I've always found it ironic that it was an American team who wrote this book!Anyone who is ever sceptical about the value of its content, I show them the pages for their Country, and within minutes they're sold on its value, even if there's something minor in there they can quibble about.I especially rely on this book for the Business Practices (Appointments, Negotiating & Entertaining) and the Protocol (Greetings) sections.I've worked in over 30 Countries, and this book has never let me down. The only times I've needed a Country that wasn't in the book was for Austria & Croatia, but you can't have everything!"
4,"great book, not so great service,","I think this a great and intersting book. It is a great help for international buisness. Although it took three weeks to get a book from someone located in the same state as me. It shouldn't have taken so long, i needed it for a class."
2,could not finish it,"The first two books in the series were good. What I noticed about this, one is that Phillip's character has changed dramatically. To the point where I don't recognize him anymore. The scenes of intimate nature in the previous books in the series were not very detailed which I prefer. In this one, however, he not only goes into detail but most of the encounters he spends pages on are horrible! I have never read so many rape scenes in my life!! (one is too many) one of these victims is only 10, the poor girl. It seems to ramble through the early 1800s with no real point in mind. There are places he will stop at and jump forward in time then flashback to where we just left off. I like to read to end my stressful day and go to sleep. This book near the end has done neither."
2,"weakest of the Kent family chronicles, thus far.","this book does not seem to contain the excitement of it's predecessors, the Bastard and the Rebels. War descriptions are lengthy at times and quite confusing and boring. The quality of the writing of this whole series seems devoid of quality and I feel this book was written more poorly than the previous novels mentioned above. I am torn as to whether to dump this seies or continue to the fourth book. THe family represented is interesting but such hard work to get through it. I read this series when it was first published and thought it was great literature. Therefore I was looking forward to rereading it. What a disappointment to learm that what I thought was great litderature 40 years ago is really soap operish trash. Don't waste your time with this book."
2,disturbing,"I find his writing disturbing. As a woman who works with victims of sexual abuse, I could not completely finish this book. The descriptions were too intense and graffic. It worries me that child molesters can access this type of material which is not porn and still get their high of seeing children raped. I would never recommend the book and would suggest the author needs sensitivity training. I know the book is supposed to be historical, but I also sincerely hope this nation was not founded by so very many low life scoundrels as appear in these books."
3,"Good book, terrible shipping cost","Book is good, HOWEVER in order to have it shipped free I had to join Amazon Prime for $79/year. First month was free so after I received the book I canceled the subscription.This was highway robbery!"
2,"52 anecdotes, not exactly life-changing...","This book takes Benjamin Franklin's ""13 Virtues improvement plan"" and expands it into 52 ""qualities"". Each quality (honesty, sense of humor, grateful, etc) has its own chapter in which the quality is (pedantically) defined, a short anecdote about the author's life that relates to the quality, and then the ""lesson"". The lesson consists of 1. ""Ask to be.. (insert quality here), 2. Affirm your desire to be..., 3. Act as if you're..., 4. List or celebrate... so on and so forth, ad nauseum (52 times).A few of the anecdotes are amusing, but this book is a failure as a self-help volume, more of a disjointed autobiography than anything else. I gave it 2 stars because it is conceivable that there is someone out there that could receive guidance from this book... just not me.."
1,Little to no strengh,I just started using this tool and found both ends bending. I will never endorse or purchase this line of tools again.
2,Challenging - Missing Web Address,"cout<< ""This book requires the use of files located on the Publishers WebSite, ALL of the laboratory assignments require them, unfortunately they never give you the website. This text is somewhat disjointed and explanations do not flow well."" <<endl;"
2,Beatles Jazz disappoiinted,I was disappointed with Beatles Jazz. The album is just so-so in terms of Beatlesmusic. I expected more closely match music.
3,"Are We Done With the Vampire, Radu?","The fourth installment of the Subspecies series is a wrap up of the series, or at least this particular story line in the series. We once again see the vampire Radu trying to control his ""fledgling"" Michelle and Michelle trying to find her way to freedom from her ""master"". The series still views like a comic-book come to life but like a comic-book you keep buying the next in the series. In this episode new vampires are introduced . . . who live a life that bears a striking resemblance to Anne Rice's ""Theater of the Vampires"" that was depicted in her first novel Interview With the Vampire. In the finale of ""Bloodstorm"" we learn what both Michelle and Radu's fate will be. I'd recommend this or any of the Subspecies films for diehard fans only."
4,"Why aren't Subspecies 1,2 & 3 on DVD!!","The Subspecies series is one of the best vampire saga's out there. Though they are low budget, they use their budget well and they have wonderful gothic atmospheres. What makes me mad is that only Subspecies 4 is on DVD! You cannot have one Subspecies movie without the others; they are all connected like one big long movie. The VHS versions of Subspecies 1-3 are even out-of-print, so there is no way to get the entire series anymore! This is terrible for fans just getting into the series and as a result they are forced to purchase bootlegged copies. What makes me wonder is if they will ever release the others again because Full Moon pictures has just folded and has gone out of business. This is a scary thought indeed. Lets just hope that someday, the first three gems will be re-released."
4,Bloodstorm:The end of Radu?,Awesome movie!The subspecies series is the best vampire series I have ever seen.Not alot of scenes of gore in there movies but the story totally hooks you.As in Bloodstorm it leaves of the day that they left the castle in subspecies 3 which i have yet to see.The woman Michelle who has been fighting Radu helps him this time around?Watch the movie and find out why.Is Radu finally dead?Who knows.I hope that they keep making the subspecies series.I reccomend if you have not seen the series go from the beginning you do not want to get lost in the story.
3,CARTOON GOTH CHEESE AT IT'S CHEESIEST,"THIS IS A GREAT FILM. I ONLY GAVE IT THREE STARS BECAUSE IT'S A GREAT ""BONEHEAD"" FILM. AS FAR AS B-GRADE CHEESY CARTOON GOTH GOES, THIS IS THE BEST, AND THE BEST IN THE SUBSPECIES SERIES. [SUBSPECIES 5 IS IN PRE-PRODUCTION NOW] [BY THE WAY, THE SUBSPECIES DVD BOX SET WILL BE OUT AROUND HALLOWEEN 2001] WHAT MORE COULD A LATE NIGHT HORROR FILM CRETIN WANT? GOOEY BLOOD, GOTHED UP VAMIRES, SEXY WOMEN WITH FANGS, LOADS OF FOG, CASTLES, AN ENDING THAT WILL DRIVE YOU CRAZY WAITING FOR # 5, AND A GREAT EERIE SCORE. IT ALMOST SEEMS LIKE THE GREAT HAMMER STUDIOS ARE ALIVE AND WELL IN FULL MOON. FEATURE PACKED DVD IS WELL WORTH THE PRICE."
2,The weakest of a truly wonderful series,"I have really liked the Heavenly Daze series. This installment,however, was so hard to get through! The challenge was not to put the book down (as in ""A Warmth in Winter"") but rather to keep picking it up!! So much whining and insecurity from all sides of the story lines. Pages and pages of the same stuff. Heavenly Daze books usually focus on a few islanders in each book and that has worked in the past, but not this time. Bobby and his pet were just obnoxious, Dana's and Mike's kiss and make-up was shallow, Annie's tomato project was lightly written off and the Cleta-Barbara thing was totally overdone although it was given the most acceptable resolution. The authors tried to touch too many bases this time. A miss with this one but the series overall is fine."
3,Keyboard needs improving,"The keyboard is really non-responsive. It's a flat membrane type keyboard where you end up smashing the key like crazy before it registers.My other lesser cripes include: the single page of instructions are really poorly written, the chip that needs to be replaced (when postage prices change) costs $50, and my very first use of the scale reported my package at 8 oz and when I took it to the Post Office it weighed 8.1 oz which was enough to cost me an additional $0.50. Therefore, add a 0.1 oz to whatever the scale says to be safe.It is very compact and it is nice to see the cost and weight of the item being shipped."
3,Questionable product,"I could never get this product to give me the same weight twice. Do to unreliability I returned the product. Also, this scale does not interface with USPS to provide a label. You must enter the weight that it says and then go to the website etc etc. Just as time consuming as going to the post office itself. At least there I am getting an accurate weight."
4,Outdated Postal Rates,The scale is every thing I wamted. The problem is it came with outdated postal rates. Exchanged twice and the same outdated postal rates. I have a third order on the way and hope it has today's postal rates.
2,Collection of old columns from Attitudes and Latitudes,"I was very excited to get this book. I love Tania's column in Attitude's. Then to find out, she just took her old columns, kind of sorted them by topic, and stuck them in book form....Boo.I hope she sits down and writes a book from scratch, looking back at her circumnavigation, her life since then. That could be a great book."
2,Ship wrecked.,"After reading the first book by Tania Aebi, Maiden Voyage, I couldn't wait to read her second book to see what happened in her life. However, I was disappointed with this book. I felt that her writing style had changed and the stories lacked the same charm and witt. I was also disappointed to find that the book was actually a group of short stories, not a continuation of Maiden Voyage. I felt there was no flow and devoid of much emeotion. All in all, I still think Tania Aebi is amazing and has lived an amazing life and Maiden Voyage will be one of my favorite books."
2,A little disappointing....,"When I read Maiden Voyage by Tania Aebi, I thought it was one of the best, well written accounts on the market...a truly amazing story. I was disappointed in this one however in that it lacked Tania's excellent and detailed story telling, and much of it was just a summary of accounts in her previous book."
1,missing pages !!,"I'm one starring(?) sheridan house not Tania, I'd like to read it if I can find a complete copy :-)))I bought two copies (presents) some time ago and only recently was told both copies were missing nearly fifty page"" right in the best part"" P 125 thru 176."
1,dyslexia by Priscilla Vail,Actually the book was informative for people who want a perspective on dyslexia not focusing on reading alone BUT I think I got cheated by Amazon because I paid $60 + for it and is was a short book and not new and worth only $10 in my opinion and I tried unsucessfully to negotiate its worth
3,lower prices but shipping was double the order price,"I really wanted to order 10-12 of these books. they are great for teachers and parents, but even with the lower price from elephant books, the shipping cost was double the book total. Offer better shipping fees and get better business. Otherwise,I won't buy from you because the ship fees were outrageous."
5,Excellent Resource Guide,As usuall these manuals are great for a resource guide. A valuable addition to my library.
1,March 2004 Playboy Magazine: Sable & Torrie,"I have yet to receive this magazine. Therefore, I cannot give any more information about it's quality and or condition."
1,Do you have a lot of time to spare?,"I have had this product for about 2 years. When you start to make a custom bag by sealing one end, it often does not seal the first time. When you add your items and begin to seal, you may find yourself standing over the machine for what feels like eternity trying to push hard enough for the seal to form. I have found that after using my machine, my wrists hurt from pushing down so hard to try to get a seal, and often, the seal is not complete and all of the air rushes back in. In addition, if there is any kind of liquid in the bag when the air is being sucked out, the liquid comes out with the air and pools inside the machine. This automatically shuts the sealer off and not only do you have to start all over again, but you also have a huge mess on your hands. When it works, it keeps meats fresh for months in the freezer. It isn't really worth the frustration though if you are looking to use it more than once in a blue moon."
2,ridiculous.,"I am a Black Belt in Kyokushin, and was a student of Mas Oyama in Japan. I wish one day Japanese movie production would make a TRUE BIOGRAPHY Film about Mas Oyama. Not Fiction movie like this one, may be 10% based on true Mas Oyama's life. He deserve to have a better, REAL biography film. The korean film ""Fighter in the Wind"" is another one that I did not like since it is not an accurate biography. It has too much of a prejudice view by the Koreans. Mas Oyama only konws the true story.....It is BEST to read a book written by Mas Oyama himself, rather than watching fiction entertaiment movies. OSU~!"
5,Marking His Own Path,"This is a highly readable and very fascinating look at one of America's most least understood, and least remembered, Supreme Court justices. The book's descriptions of White's judicial career are just as interesting as the author's portrait of Oxford in the 1930s and Denver during the middle of the 20th Century.Having read biographies of William Brennan and Harry Blackmun, Nathan Lewin's assessment of White -- written in 1984 -- really stands out for me during this work. Lewin wrote that White's career on the bench fulfilled the role ... that ... Brennan had served on the Warren Court -- as the guiding intellectual influence of the institution. With a steady hand and a belief that the other branches of government set social policy, White forged his own path and played a key role in American history."
3,See it for Beyonce if nothing else...,"While the movie it self isn't the best of the best, the scences with Beyonce are electrifying and worth seeing. I gave it 3 stars because the movie isn't worth buying, by it's definitely worth a 4 dollar rental to enjoy the magic of Beyonce on the screen. The suduction scene and the cards scene are worth your 4 bucks alone. Don't put money on this film making you sit on the edge of your seat, it's not that type of film. To put it in perspective try and rent the original carmen (if you can find it!) and the hip-hopera and watch both. So go out one tuesday nite when you have nothing better to do and engage yourself in this enjoyable when not so memorable experience."
4,liked it,"I think the movie was great, even if beyonce doesn't seem that type of girl, she still did a great job. Even more then the movie itself, i just loved the ""making of carmen"" that u can find in the special features. I think it's worth buying!Have fun!"
3,Different,I don't think Beyonce can act as good as she sing or dance but she keeps trying and eventulally she will get it right.
4,Who's the bad-boy cop??,"i thought beyonce was brilliant in this movie, with a great voice...also i think the guys in the cast were very sexy!!!by the way does anyone know the name of the bad-boy cop in the film??? hollor back!! xxx"
4,"Sexy, musical & dramatic","Carmen is the story of Beyonce - the troublemaker and hottie of the town, and Mekhi Phifer who plays Officer Hill. Hill is engaged to the perfect woman (not Beyonce, another girl)... until one night when he has to drive Carmen to the police station and thats when the drama begins. Carmen will do anything to get out of going to jail. Even seducing him. And thats where everything starts to go wrong..Its not anything spectacular, but its good to watch once or twice. The songs in it are pretty good.. especially ""If looks could kill"" which Beyonce & Mos Def sang really well... and the twist definately suprised me. There are some boring bits, but overall i enjoyed it and i think its worth watching.Oh and the quality of the dvd was good too!"
1,The worst movie I have seen in 10 years...,"What exactly is this supposed to be? A muscial soap opera? If you are going to do an adaptation of Carmen that takes place in the 21st century, it might be a good idea to have a few things like: 1) a script that makes sense. 2) Actors who can act. 3) Actors who can at least understand the lines they have to read. 4) and maybe a couple songs that actually move the story along. This movie, if you can call it that, is so bad you want to stop if half way through and break the DVD in half. I am sorry I didn't do just that. But at least I can sell it back to some sucker on Amazon or on Ebay and get some of my money back."
2,Bleah,"If you read the actual Zathura book, you quickly realize that it's probably Allsburg's weakest. Although the movie enhanced and expanded the story quite a bit, I was left disappointed. I turned to my wife a handful of times in the theater just wishing that the kids would stop shouting at each other and get on with the story. For crying out loud, I can come home from work at the wrong moment if I want to listen to kids yelling at each other. Yeah, they used some awful words too; but they were unlikeable characters for the most part because of their endless banter.The movie had an endless potential for good adventure: an entire universe. Yet, the story revolves around their little house the entire time, and the perils repeat themselves rather than introducing something unique.Don't see it thinking that it in some way relates to Jumanji, like it did in the book either. They don't resemble each other at all. Miss this movie."
2,Nothing like Jumanji.........,"One of those movies with action and great special effects, but nothing going on. Not much story and no acting. ""Jumanji"" was a great film the whole family could enjoy because there was interaction and depth between the charcaters and a story that kept drawning you back in. I would not recomend ""Zathura"" to anyone over 12 years old."
1,Very bad,"Very annoying to see two brothers screaming one at the other for two hours, even with a happy ending, in a nutshell that's the story... Also, who needs a second Jumanji."
2,Decent Kid's Movie,"It's a decent movie for kids, but not for adults. I found it to be too geared towards children unlike Jumanji which was geared towards all ages. Also, was I the only one who noticed that in the beginning when the sister was frozen the dice said they must go five times before she could be ""unfrozen""? They must have went about 8-10 times before she was unfrozen. There were too many mistakes like that one in it."
4,Surprisingly good kids movie!,"We picked this dvd up for my son (8) and my daughter (2)a couple weeks back.When we all set down to watch it I had my doubts, but must say I was most pleasantly surprised! The special effects were very good, acting really solid and the story was pretty neat to. All yeah the scare factor for a kid's movie is up there to. My 2 year old would watch it white knuckled then turn around and laugh and cheer when it was over demanding it be put on again. And no nightmares!Well if you have a child who likes SiFi don't hesitate to get them this movie."
4,great,"if you have children,this is the dvd you want to watch with them. it will take you to the universe and back, in a fun way!"
4,Zathura Movie Review,If you like Jumanjii you will like Zathura. This is a great family movie about kids who start a game that takes place in space. It isn't cheesy and is exciting the whole way through. I gave it 4 stars because there is some inappropriate language in a few scenes.
4,Good script; Blu-Ray edition Review,"Good script, good story line, but one minor actor problem.Shirley Temple...if she could do it at age 7 (very well by the way), than one actor with charisma could do movies like this one. It's not entirely believable script but it's creative and I like the sarcasm.The older brother was not a very good actor compared to his younger brother. That was until the Astronaut (Dax Shepard) came in......the older brother still weren't All that great but his younger brother and the Astronaut should have won an Emmy, a Golden globes, and a VIP ticket to the MTV movie awards were everyone claps and cheers on Que.The above sentence may have been a little sarcasm but J. Favreau and C. Allsburg have Creative talent. Four starts; nothing more because IMO they should have hired Macaulay Culkin from Home Alone. The actors-over-artist were good but the artist (the script writers and Allsburg) obviously have creative minds.This is for the Blu-Ray edition; same movie just high-def."
4,Surprising presentation,"Awesome sound and video presentation, cool movie, greatly impressed. Major upgrade from DVD, good test for a mod to high end home theater setup."
5,Great Film; Superb Extras,"The film speaks for itself; It's a Rocket ride right from the start of the discovery of the board game. The Extras explain the link to JUMANJI, and no its not made to be a sequel.It is clearly done on a lower budget, but the director shows that the marriage of practical FX and CGI works superbly. For a film that revolves very much around an essentially single set, with additions, this is fun. You can get to see how Stan Winston Studios did such a great job. And the extras, including the commentary all exude enthusiasm for the film craft.Do not expect a JUMANJI clone, but DO expect all of the craft that the Van Allsburg imagination has created. There is an interview with Allsburg that just shows beautifully how he has created so many different worlds.The Audio is carefully crafted; the visuals are great, and the fun is immense.ENJOY"
4,this is a neat kids movie,"When you see the couch burning in outer space you know this movie isa kid's fantasy version of sci fi, but that doesn'tmake the excitement and adventure any less!Some really funny stuff goes on in this movie like the teenage sister freezing solidand the robot that wants to kill the alien life-form Walter...I enjoyed the movie actually more than Jumanji,but that same kind of lesions are taught.Stepped in what and didn't wipe your feet after..."
5,Zathura is OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!,"I purchased two copies of Zathura, one for myself and one for my brother's kids, after seeing it on TV. It is hands down one of the BEST action family films I've ever seen! I love the movie Jumanji but the Zathura has it beat in the quality of the special effects alone! Also, I don't think I could ever tire of watching Zathura, the chemistry of the kids is exemplary and comes across as real and genuine. Zathura is just a GREAT action, adventure, sci-fi, family film!!! It will have you spellbound from the meteors to the very end!!!"
3,Zathura Dvd,"Great movie if you like kids with bad attitudes and lots of border line offensive language. I mean, come on Hutcherson, you have a great acting career doing cool movies, why ruin a good ride. The movie's plot is ok, and the effects are pretty cool, but I would not recommend this movie."
2,Ruined by two foul words,"I never write reviews, but how could I resist when this request appeared on my e-mail? My three-year-old son called me a ""bi-atch"" the other day. I was shocked -- we don't even have TV! After questioning his teachers at school, I gave up on finding the source until I heard this movie play in our van. The first thing Walter says to his robot is, ""Get me a juice box, bi-atch."" I also have to point out that Sammy screams, ""You're such a dick"" to his brother in the first 20 minutes of the movie. Now why on earth would they have to ruin such a good movie with two words?"
2,Jumanji 2 - Just When You Thought It was Safe to Play a Board Game Again,"I'm sure the 13-and-unders might find this exciting and riveting, but from an adult perspective... this is nothing more than the atrocious Jumanji Revisited. It's not as BAD as Jumanji, the special effects are much better in this one (not saying much), and it's not as ANNOYING either, thanks to the absence of Robin Williams hogging all the screen time and stepping on everyone else's lines... but if you've sat and suffered thru THAT mess, there's no need to sit and suffer through this, it's the same setup, the same plot (now set in outer space instead of a jungle), and the same ending. Why was this even made?"
4,Game was cool!,"I would have drooled over the mechanical Zathura game when I was a kid. The game brought me into the movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The constant bickering between the brothers was annoying, but that was the point. The special effects were fun. The plot was original. The monsters were somewhat scary. The dialogue between the brothers rang true. The older sister's part was small, but that she was not that involved. There was no lack of air in space, but it was an universe within the confines of the game. The logic within the movie was somewhat consistent and that is all I ask of a movie. My wife even liked the movie and she hates SciFi. I liked Zumanji and this movie was better done almost on every level.There is no message to the movie, except that older brothers should act like older brothers and take responsibility for their siblings. Actually, in this day and age that is a good message."
1,FAIR FOR YOUNG TEENS! BORING+ NOT FOR ADULTS! RENT DO NOT BUY!,"SCREAMING YOUNG KID, DRIVES YOU CRAZY, EXTREMELY LACKING IN DIALOGUE!!!"
1,Sooooo disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I bought this movie for my children and they WILL NOT be watching it! It is sad that a movie that should be fun for kids uses foul languauge. In the first 5 minutes of the movie the younger child calls his brother a d*ck. I am so glad I previewed this before letting my 4 & 6 year olds watch it. Then the older boy uses b*itch when talking about the robot. I know it has a PG rating but is the language really neccessary!!!
3,"Marvelous production, weak story line","This movie really deservres about 2.5 stars, but I'll round up because I enjoyed it despite its many flaws. The production is first-rate, and the retro look of the board game and the things it generates (robot, monsters, space ships) is wonderful. Unfortunately, the story line is thin, verging on nonsensical. The kids are exposed to various perils AND GIVEN NO WAY TO COMBAT THEM. Occasionally, they are given a ""way out"" but fail to take it.The kids' acting is adequate, but no more. The teenage sister seems to be in the movie only to look cute. And the ""message"" -- brothers should stick together -- is pretty simpleminded. Still, ""Zathura"" is reasonably entertaining. After a slow start it moves right along, and it offers kid-friendly adventure without being mind-numbingly dull for parents."
5,Great!,"I rented this movie with my 4 grandkids--ages 4-11. They loved it.Lots of action that was able to keep even the youngest engaged to the very end.The words of the kids when it was over--sums it up well. ""Bubbi, this is good enough to buy and add to our DVD collection""I agree and we now own it."
4,Good for Kids and adults,This is a nice movie to view on a lazy Sunday afternoon. The children in the movie gave a good performance. A bonus was to see Kristen Stewart--in a small role. I order many used DVD's from Amazon. But I no longer order new DVD's. I save about $5 getting them at Target-new.
4,Non-stop action,"Great action movie. Once it got going, it never slowed down. Lots of fun. The only complaint I have is that I found the depiction of the teenage girl extremely sexist - and I am not a feminist! She was shown in visually sexual manner and as extremely self-centered. If the objective of the character's portrayal was to depict how a teenage sister might be seen by their younger brothers, the part was very well played by the young actress. If the part was scripted to sex up the movie or include some off-beat humor, I suspect many would find the portrayal offensive.The script did a good job of showing friction between two brothers of differing ages and their reconciliation."
4,ZATHURA ROCKS,"My kids LOVE!!!!! this movie. Except for a slightly scary part in the middle, my 6 year old twins have watched this movie over and over and over again for the past 2 weeks. My son is AOK with the ZORGON creatures, but my daughter has to leave the room for a short time when they appear. Otherwise, I would recommend watching this movie for yourself in order to better judge the reaction your own child will have to the ZORGON's. ENJOY"
2,Not very good,"I hate the characters in this. Everything is fake to them. They think they can pretend their way through life. Why would I emotionally invest in a play if none of the characters are worth my time? There are some deep, important issues touched on, depression and suicide, but I prefer these issues be approached in an entertaining way. People don't go to plays to feel bad about life."
2,Pippi Longstocking,Very disappointed. This book has no illustrations whatsoever. Who ever heard of a childrens book with no pictures!
1,Amazon now part of the rip-off market!,"I ordered the item pictured at the price offered, BUT I was sent only one book at triple the price! Amazon now says I have the choice to return the book at their expense for a full credit, or keep the book at a discount! What a bunch of BS! What about my choice to NOT waste my time and effort dealing with something I never ordered in the first place! By law, you do NOT have to pay for or return anything you did not order - why can Amazon get around the law with this kind of crappy marketing? This is NOT the way to keep satisfied customers!"
3,It will rise...It will bore!,"Too much crummy acting in this one, and not enough quality make-up effects makes this hard to recommend. Most of the gore is a person lying stock-still with blood and meat poured on them while (Egyptian!?) zombies sit around chewing. This way-low-budget flick doesn't really have set-piece effects where you see the ripping and tearing (think Savini's work in Day of The Dead), so it flops as a gore shocker. Even the machette in the head scene is very poorly done, with a quick edit to a laughable 'dummy' head for the hit. Still, for the price, it's a cheap ride, so you can add it to the collection without much buyer's remorse."
1,off the mark,"At Amazon's recommendation, I purchased this and was completely disappointed. It sounded like a christian church choir attempting a beautiful Hindi chant - OM track was ok but Om Namah Shivaya was way off the mark. Sorry I bought it."
5,A powerful chant yet so soothing....,"I have heard several different chants of Om Namah Shivaya, but have taken a special liking to the one in this CD. It is soothing yet powerful. It moves me inside and awakens my sense of spirituality. I hear it every morning without fail. One need not specifically be of Hindu religion to experience this joy....... A must must must buy and keep.......I possess two copies...."
3,"Those wanting an ""eastern"" sound experience, look elsewhere","[...]I bought this CD a few years back, after hearing the second track, ""Om,"" at a new age bookstore. When I got home and listened to the first track, a very western-sounding rendition of Om Namaha Shivaya, I was very disappointed in the disc, but I kept it for the ""Om"" track, which I sometimes use for relaxing music; and occasionally for meditation, when I'm feeling particularly agitated, and having trouble settling my mind down (although I usually meditate w/o music).[...]If you want something a lot more idiomatic, I highly recommend a CD called, Sacred Chants of Shiva: From the Banks of the Ganges, on the Heaven on Earth Music Label. In addition to five other tracks of chants about Shiva, this excellent disc concludes with a 31-minute rendition of Om Namaha Shivaya. Both the vocals and instrumentation are a lot more idiomatic than the Robert Gass version. [...]"
2,I returned this item.,"I decided to give this poly hose hanger a shot. It looked nice, but I returned it right away. It was flimsy and bent easily."
4,Louis Sings!,"Louis Armstrong's last recording features his vocals on a surprising collection of songs, including 'What a Wonderful World,' 'The Creator has a Master Plan (Peace)' [+ Leon Thomas, vocals], 'Mood Indigo', 'This Cat has 9 Lives,' 'Give Peace a Chance' [John Lennon], etc. Great orchestra and vocal backing. A joyful and inspirational time!"
2,Not what it appears to be,"The mask is lined with plastic which becomes hard when it gets cold, making it very difficult to breathe. It also doesn't stay on very well, so if you turn your head, it doesn't stay on your face. I've gone back to just using a good scarf and am getting better results."
1,1 3 pack = 3 coasters,"I wasted a three pack trying to burn to the Memorex disks to a USB ND-2510A. I was using both Nero and Roxio DVD Copy, and had the same results. I went out and bought the Verbatim DL disks and did not have any problems whatsoever."
1,stinkin riteks,"There are only a few DVD+R DL media makers out there. MKM, Ritek, Ricoh, & philips, i believe. Most labels use the ritek media because they're cheap, and that's exactly what they are ""CHEAP"", crap, anyway you want to describe it. I've never had problems burning and playing back MKM Verbatims but these I bought, burned as DVDROM bookytpe, & verified. Played them on 3 different players and they exhibit alot of freezes, skips, etc. Why o why do memorex use riteks. So I won't be buying anymore DL media from memorex."
1,"Is it crap, or is it Memorex?","3 discs sold in jewel cases so they can charge a zillion dollars for $.10 of extra plastic and paper.First disc worked fine until about 15 minutes into the movie. Which would've been fine had the movie been, say, ""Baby Geniuses.""So, in reality, this is like a 400 mb DVD. Not 8.7 gb.The Memorex brand deserves to be driven into the ground. It's a trusted brand from...the 80s? So it gets placement in Best Buy and all the big franchise stores based on identity alone and the outlived perception that Memorex = quality.But you'll have better luck recording a full-length movie onto one of your audio tapes from '87 than you will with these 3 DVDs."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I read the other reviews before I decided to take a chance on theses DVDs. I have a new NEC Dual Layer drive with the latest firmware and thought I would be fine. I was wrong. I tried burning two dvds and both failed. I tried the same content on a Verbatim DVD and it worked fine. Amazon let me return the order, but only refunded 75% of my money after they deducted shipping costs."
2,It worked after the firmwares update,"I'm writing this because I had most people's problem. It just wouldn't work. I followed the advise and updated the firmware and it did the trick, I just went to my computer's online support website and downloaded it. I'm putting 2 stars because of all the trouble I went through. I think this, being apparently such a common problem, should be at the very least mentioned somewhere in the product, so people don't have to do a whole research trying to figure out what's wrong."
1,"dual dvds, takes two to make one.","I read the reviews about how bad these were but, because they were cheap I thought I would try them. I bought nine of which four actually worked and five are coasters... I strongly suggest buying another brand. My dvd drive was up to date with latest firmware, using dvd shrink with Nero burn engine. Success was hit or miss."
4,Make sure you have the latest firmware,"I own a Dell Inspiron Labtop with NEC-ND6500A Dual Layer Drive.When I first put these discs in, the drive would not recognize them. After some research, I learned that Dual layer media is extremely picky about the drive's firmware. I went to the Dell Website and found the right firmware. After installing the latest firmware, the discs were now recognized by my drive.As far as the burning goes, I was able to get 3 perfect backups.If the prices were the same, I would go with Verbatim as well, but given that they are much cheaper, I am going to stick with these Memorex discs."
2,Lots Of Coasters,"The quality of these discs is dubious as I have made at least 1 ""coaster"" out of each box of 3 (I have bought 6 boxes). The error from the drive is a media error. I have used the Verbatim discs (dual layer & others) before & out of 6 discs got 1 bad burn which could have been operator error as it was one of the first discs I burned with the new drive. Unfortunately ""Memorex"" isnt a manufacturer anyomore (my dad worked there ages ago when they actually made products branded ""Memorex"" - reel to reel tape, etc.) but it is simply a name that has been purchased by another entity, such as the great names Marantz, Bell & Howell, etc. etc. These discs arent on the ""recomended"" list from my drive maker so I am partially to blame for the failed discs - always check the drive makers list before buying especially if your using them for data backup as I was trying to do."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"I bought 2 packs (6 discs), 3 discs burned with lots of skips and freezes and 3 failed. And what's worst the final disc broke my dvd drive! The discs made my burner somehow burnout with all the errors. Never had a problem with my drive before these discs. Luckily my pc was under full warranty with DELL (love them) and they sent me a new drive.I tried one of the ""succesful"" burned disc on the new drive and it still skipped, so i threw them all away.Bought different brand dvd+r DL and they work great, no errors and no skips... yeah!!!!"
1,Dual Layer Coasters,I got a 25 pack of these dual layer media on sale and over half of them have read errors.DVDS freeze and skip making them useless.Never again
1,DO NOT BUY,Puchased these and not one worked. They burned correctly just would not play or be recognized. STAY AWAY
5,Double The Storage,If you need to store more data than what a standard blank DVD media can handle then this is the one for you. They're reliable. No read and write errors. No problems so far.
1,TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!!,"Chances are none of these will work. Don't waste your money on memorex like I did! Try Verbatim instead, they work every time. Nothing more frustrating than watching discs fail one after another after another! I will never buy memorex discs again!!"
1,Absolutely Worthless,I never have had a problem with Memorex blank media before but this incident changed my mind. I have burnt cd's and dvd's with their products since they usually come at a good price. The reason I bought these were they are the cheapest dual layer dvd's I could find. I could not get any of them to work but any other brand would work in my burner. Now whenever I think of buying something from memorex it kind of leaves me with reservations before purchasing their products. If you are lucky they will work for you but me absolutely not. Next time I will spend extra with a brand like TDK or Sony when it comes to dual layer.
1,dual layer dvd disk for what?,"I STILL AM NOT SURE WHY I PURCHASED THESE (6) DUAL LAYER DVD'S AFTER ONE YEAR ON MY SHELF, I TRIED TO BURN A DVD MOVIE ON ONE, AS IT WAS TOO LARGE FOR A STANDARD DVD AND IT COPIED HALF AND THEN QUIT, RUINING THE DUAL LAYER DISK AND LEAVING ME UNABLE TO MAKE A COPY OF THE MOVIE I WAS WANTING TO BACK UP. SO UNLESS YOU HAVE A REAL NEED FOR A DUAL LAYER DISK I WOULD NOT ADVISE YOU TO MAKE THE PURCHASE."
2,wrong one,"the watch is cheaply made, but i knew it would be for the price. unfortunately, i was not sent the watch i ordered. i was sent the 10$ blue faced watch when i ordered the 20$ black faced watch.the watch is still working, however."
1,Poorly written and overpriced,"A polemical diatribe that simply tries too hard. Considered purely as a novel, possibly in the thriller genre, it is poorly done. The characterisation is pathetic. Just cardboard. The dialog is utterly repetitive. The two secondary heroes are just sounding boards to the main character. Sherlock Holmes' Watson was hollow, but still light years ahead of these secondary characters.Then there is the plot itself. All too reminiscent of the Y2K scare. Remember that? Planes falling out of the sky. Pacemakers freezing up. Utility companies' generators stopping. Just like Ed Yourdon and others peddled Y2K in the late 90s, this book has the same feel. Hysteria combined with an opportunistic grab at the topical problem of terrorism.Purely as a $8 paperback novel, it is lacking. But as a $35 book?? Strewth."
1,Fifty-dollar list price for a novel??? Gimme a break!,"The first problem I have with this book is the absolutely laughable price tag. Even at Amazon's discount, thirty-five bucks is still a joke for a novel!The second problem I have with this novel is that it simply isn't very good. The author is second rate, at best. So, since it's a second rate work of fiction, shouldn't it be priced at about half the price of a popular novel, such as those by Stephen King, Tom Clancy, etc...?Where does a nobody clown that no one ever heard of get off trying to gouge people for fifty bucks, and for a cheesy work of fiction to boot!?!?!?The 2 guys who gave it 5 stars are paid reviewers, I'm not (and one of them even states that the book isn't very good). I just like to read, and I work for a living. Take my advice: Before you even think about tossing your money away on this book, go to a bookstore and read the first couple of pages. Once you've done that, I suspect you'll put your money to better use."
2,Not well written,"This book is a slog to get through. It's an exploration of the world of whitehat and blackhat hackers, the FBI, and well, I really couldn't get through it because the writing wasn't very good. The dialogue in particular was painful to get through. The characters weren't very well developed. I would like to have been able to recommend this book. I think there are some interesting ideas in there, but they are just too far past all of the tough dialogue."
3,They get the job done but be gentle.,"I have 3 sets (pairs) of these stands from buying them through packaged deals. They get the job done. Be careful of the two tightening rings, if you overtighten them, they will break. One thing that does help them live longer is to make sure when you put em away leave em loose.They are ok for the money, i'm not sure what else out there at this price point is going to be any better but I do know i've had a couple of sets of stands that were cheaper and they broke even faster.I believe Ultimate has a lifetime warranty on the stands, not sure what that involves but I really hate packing things up and shipping them anywhere, not to mention the cost of shipping being a factor on whether or not to just pitch em in the trash and buy a new set. Though I suppose I could drill some new holes and put some bolts through em and use it as a semi-permanent mount."
5,Wow!,This is an incredible compilation of the most popular and influential science fiction writers in history.Each story is thoroughly enjoyable and has a poignancy all its own. From Asimov to Heinlein you won't be dissapointed.
5,BUY THIS BOOK NOW!!,"I grew up on my big sister's copy of this; I don't think she has it anymore, so I'm buying a copy NOW and passing her the link.Some of the best short SF ever! I SAID ""NOW""!!"
3,"The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume One","After reviewing this book, I gave it as a gift. The receiver tells me he is currently enjoying it."
4,A good collection of short stories from before 1965,"I didn't know exactly what this was before I took a chance on it, but I'm glad I did: the stories are almost all good and I haven't read most of them in other science fiction short story collections. If you're looking into this, be aware this is a collection of 26 short stories that should be the best short stories written before 1965, as selected by the members of the Science Fiction Writers of America (SciFi authors themselves). The book also tries to span a wide variety of authors so none have more than one story selected.Unless you're extremely well-read in the science fiction short story department and already have most of these stories, you'll probably find good stuff here worth having."
5,A trip down memory lane,"I've checked it out of the library more than once, but this is such a good book to own. If you want to see how science fiction is done, or learn how to write it yourself, this is the collection for you. It's a who's who of the grandmasters at the top of their game. There isn't a single story here that won't provoke or haunt you in some way shape or form."
2,A collection that mostly left me cold,"I've read a lot of SF over the years, including stories by many of the authors featured in this anthology. Obviously I'm in the minority here but I found of the selected works to be dated, overly long, and dull. The ending of at least one story (That Only A Mother) made no sense at all. There are of course some exceptions, like Bradbury's Mars Is Heaven. A no-brainer for any collection. And a little tale called It's A Good Life will give you the chills. Star Trek fans will of course recognize the premise of the story Arena, which was adapted into a Trek episode of the same name. But all in all, the selections were mostly a letdown."
5,Great SCi-Fi,"This is a great collection of stories, even if you're not a sci-fi fan. They are mind expanding and have alot to tell us about ourselves."
4,Definitely worth buying,"This is a great anthology. I'd read some of the stories before, but only those that everyone's read: Flowers for Algernon, Nightfall, The Cold Equations and so on. I think that of all of them, Helen O'Loy was likely my least favorite, and my favorite was a tie between That Only a Mother and Mimsy Were the Borogoves.There was no overall theme. This isn't an anthology of SciFi horror or Space Opera. The stories run the gamut but all have a sense of their era. Inventiveness, inquisitiveness, and a fear of nuclear war abound, immediately dating the stories. Despite being obviously tied to the movement of the genre at the time, they don't really feel campy or silly the way that some of the stories from Asimov's Before the Golden Age does.I really recommend this for anyone who loves science fiction."
4,A gripping space adventure,"Samuel R. Delany won the Nebula award for this novel and it is easy to see why. He manages to write an engaging adventure while incorporating many fascinating science fiction ideas and creating engaging characters. His most interesting idea is his exploration of the use of language and it makes you think and view language in a new way. Along with this are exciting weapons, characters and drama which combine to provide exciting action scenes. A novel that has a bit for everyone, adventure, thought provoking ideas and absorbing characters."
5,A true classic,"This book is simply amazing. All science fiction fans should read this! This is Delany's finest work (in my opinion), and should absolutely not be missed. The story is about language, identity, meaning. Ahead of its time, I don't know why this book isn't lauded by all, instead of being hard to find. I'm not going to spoil the story. If you like science fiction in general, you're going to like this."
3,Original but minimalistic,"Who better to write a sci-fi novel about alien linguistics but Samuel R. Delany. Everytime I read one of his books I am both irritated and awed at the same time. Irritated in that his prose is so minimalistic that it robs you of the story; in awe because he does manage to describe a lot with very few words. Babel-17 has many new and original idea (cyberpunk modifying of your bodie, discorporate souls for ship navigation, etc), but it a lot of it gets lost in the eloquent prose. I wish he would have taken a little more time and wrote a little more to flesh out the small world he created in Babel-17. This is definately not Delany's best work. If you want a great space romp that's very similar in style and setting as Babel-17, read Nova."
3,A Very Interesting Concept - Diluted,"The first disappointment I had with this novel was receiving it from Amazon and discovering that the cover was different from the one shown above (which, I am unashamed to admit, constituted about 30% of my interest in purchasing this book).From there, things improved as I began to read, and then slumped towards the end. Without giving any plot elements away, the ideas behind Babel-17 and the very apparent research Mr. Delany exhibits throughout are formidable and truly engaging. However, they are somewhat compromised by the campier trappings of the time period during which the book was written - Babel-17's vision of the future is complete with groovy furniture that inflates from the floor tiles - so its potential seems squandered. However, it also reflects a form of sci-fi that rarely rears its head nowadays; thought-provoking without having to be ironic, dramatic without having to be dystopian, Babel-17 is an undeniably unique and entertaining read."
4,Excellent thought-provoking sketches,"These are incredibly entertaining and thought-provoking stories, but they're not pure entertainment. While they are not quite as abstruse as something like Philip Dick, they do require some work on the part of the reader in order to be appreciated fully. Readers who want a pure fun sci-fi adventure will likely find these somewhat disappointing, as will those who prefer a thoroughly fleshed out and minutely detailed universe. That isn't the purpose of these stories. These are short sketches, intended to investigate ideas about perception and existence. Taken for what they are, they are wonderful gems, both of them."
2,Psychodelic sci-fi.,Can a poetess save the universe? This 1966 Nebula award winning novel tells us the story.The Nebulas are awarded to the best NEW novels. Not necessarily the ones that survive the test of time.
5,Not Free SF Reader,"Linguistic heroine saves the day.One of those books where the author comes up with something a bit strange and different, especially as far as the crewing of Rydra's ship goes.A brilliant young woman's help is needed to deal with communicate with aliens, otherwise much bloodshed.Along with this she has to deal with military politics into the bargain.A very cool book.4.5 out of 5"
5,great toy,"Excellent toy. My doggie loves it. This is her second one, the first one she miss placed. When this one is gone, will order another one,."
4,My Dog Loves Her Squirrel,It really is the size of a squirrel. The only drawback is that my dog chews on the exposed feet and she's already removed the squeeker. I needed to repair the squirrel after only one week.But my dog loves it.
5,Adorable and durable,"This teddy bear is adorable and has been the center of attention for both of my dogs. We bought it for our puppy since she is teething, but both dogs play tug of war with this stuffed toy and so far, it has not shredded one bit. We have a pomeranian puppy (about 6 pounds) and a pekingnese beagle (about 20 pounds). The older dog is an aggressive chewer and he did not break this yet (which was very surprising!). I even washed this in the machine and it still is in perfect shape. Next time, I will get this in a darker color because it looks dingy already and its brand new. I definitely recommend this for puppies and dogs alike."
4,Very popular toy!,"I bought this toy for my minature dachshund pup to indulge his hunting instincts - a big hit! From day one it has had pride of place in his basket, and if he loses it under the sofa for a day he greets it the next day like a long-lost friend. Great, sturdy toy that he loves to fetch and chew. Even with his sharp little teeth and love of tearing things to shreds, this bunny has lasted for months already. Would recommend!"
2,Squeaker quited in minutes,"My dog loves the squirrel but the squeaker broke in probably 10 minutes of play. She still likes to bite and carry it around, so I still gave it 2 stars."
2,quickly destroyed!,"My 2 year old beagle mix destroyed this toy within about an hour. It's easy to throw, but you'd be better off buying a cheap frisbee that isn't such an expensive sacrifice :)"
2,torn to shreds by my 30 lb Jindo,"After all the reviews about how durable and tugging-friendly this toy was, I was very excited to get it for my 2 pups. Within 30 minutes, most of the squirrel had been torn off the ring, and the squeaker in the tail had been pulverized by my 30 lb Jindo (with minimal help from our GSD). Within a few days, the rope ring had been completely unbraided and lies lifeless on the floor now. It provided plenty of entertainment for the dogs for about an hour, and now it's done."
5,My dogs favorite toy!!,"My golden retriever tries so hard to catch the real squirrels, but that has yet to happen. She loves this toy cause it looks real from a distance!"
3,Entertaining while it lasted!,"My 15 pound Cavalier Spaniel loved this toy, it took him longer to destroy than most of his other toys. He went straight for the paws and slowly chewed them off until he could get to the stuffing. I was quite impressed at how much stuffing this squirrel held, very big mess but oh well, my dog had a blast destroying this toy."
5,Cutest Little Fox,"I bought the Fox for my 9 lb mini schnauzer puppy. It is so cute. It's like a miniature baby fox and my puppy loves it. It's made so well and so nice, it looks better in person than the picture. I would like one for myself. I think a big dog would eat it."
4,Great Toy - Dog Loves It,"My boxer-pointer mix loves this squirrel. Somehow we have kept him from destroying it though the tail is easily and quickly ""de-furred"". I kept finding tufts of squirrel tail all over the house. Once we got that under control, toy has held up nicely."
2,morte the squirrel,"First, his little nose went, then his paws. Now his head is hanging off. My keeshond puppy insists she did not do this, but no one else in the family tends to attack squirrels, so I doubt her story. Rest in pieces, little squirrel-you had a full life in your three days at our house."
3,Nice product if your dog is not a strong chewer,"This seems like a quality product if your dog is not a strong chewer. My 80 pound puppy loved it....carried it around, slept with it. But within about 2 weeks, he had several breaks in the stitching from chewing on it and pretty soon the stuffing was all over my house. I don't think this would happen with a mild to medium chewer... it initally seemed pretty well put together."
4,Looks great. Dog loves it. Not tough enough.,"My dogs are 1 year old; one is a 40 lb Border Collie mix and the other is a 60 lb Staffordshire Terrier/Lab mix. They are about equal in their chewing skills.I bought the squirrel and the hedgehog and I really wanted to like these toys, especially after all the good reviews about how tough they were. Alas, they didn't last an hour.I think these toys really are tougher than most other stuffed toys, but my dogs went nuts for them more than they do for most stuffed toys as well. The squirrel lasted longer than the hedgehog, but the squirrel had a hole within an hour and the squeaker was out the next day.I'll give this toy 4 stars although it didn't last just because my dogs loved them and played with the inside out exoskeletons for a few weeks afterwards. I may purchase again if they go on sale, just without high expectations."
3,Not for averyone,"I have 3 little guys. Two cocker spaniels anda jack russell terrier. So, you can imaging my surprise when none of them liked the squirrel. I got it for the jack russell terrier first because has killed live ones before when he lived in a ruraL area with my dad, but he can't live like that with me. Aparently a sueeky squirrel just didn't do it for him. They all love squeek toys , but I think that they were put off by the thick plush fur. It is very cute and soft though."
3,not as durable as other AKC products,"i was surprised by how quickly this hedgehog was torn apart. my dog plays hard, but never destroys this - this was a first. he did love it for the 2 months or so that it stayed whole. akc products are usually very good - this didn't last. unless they change the quality of the toy, i can't recommend it."
4,"Duck, duck, Goose, goose","We discovered that our eight year old Lab, a rescue dog, loves squeaky toys and doesn't destroy them. He likes the AKC Duck best but this CANADA (not Canadian, please!) Goose is also a winner. For some reason the rabbit, which has been panned by other reviewers, did not squeak after the first day. Instead it feels like there is a plastic bag in its belly that crinkles.If your dog likes to tear toys apart, these are too easily destroyed. Try the Kyjen Hard Boiled Softies Dog Toys instead. The Hedgehog we have is loud and tough. The rubber shell makes it fun to throw as it is heavy and bouncy."
1,Very Poor Quality,"Purchased this toy for our small 6 pound Yorkie. Within 15 minutes of play, the stuffing was coming out of the beak and the seam had completely opened on the underside. Very poor quality for a dog's toy."
4,Fav toy,My 1 year old Golden Retriever loves this toy. He has removed the arms from the ring but has not been able to destroy it. I actually bought two of these.
1,"AKC Squirrel Dog Toy, Small","This squirrel dog toy looks exactly like the AKC squirrel dog toy I had purchased from Camping World. It lasted about one year with two Italian Greyhounds playing tug of war with it everyday. However, this one purchased from Jakks Pacific through Amazon lasted only one week before the tail came off and the stuffing was all over the house. The description online stated that it is an AKC squirrel dog toy but is actually an American Classic squirrel dog toy which can be purchased at Publix for $3.59. I paid $12.00 for this one. Totally disappointed."
1,poor quality,"I bought one of the AKC squirrels before and my dog loved it, it took him weeks to destroy it. I recently bought this one and he had it ripped open in 10 minutes! I checked it out and its not the same quality as previous, the quality is why I was a repeat customer now its the reason I WONT buy AKC products again"
4,My Aussie loved the way this toy grunted.,The first hedgehog I bought for Quigley outlived all his other plush toys. No other toy has shown the durability of this hedgehog. I'm so glad to have found a place to get a new one.
2,Not very durable,"My 1 yr old Husky/Lab mix had this toy for about 1 1\2 days before it started to fall apart. First, she took of each ear individually then worked her way through the threading from there it seems. After the second day the squirrel was in shreds. I wouldn't recommend this if your dog is any kind of chewer or has anything resembling teeth."
1,AKC Classic Canadian Goose,"This is such a beautiful toy that I hesitated to give it to my dog.After I gave it to her, the squeaker only lasted for about15 minutes. Needless to say, this brand of toy is not built very tough.I have bought several toys in this brand. All of the squeakers go out very fast. If you are buying a toy because your dog loves to squeak them, I would not recommend buying these for your dog. My dog did not want to play with these toys after the squeaker quit working. We havesome toys that are a few years old and the squeakers are still working.Bob"
4,Sqweaky good fun,My beagle loves this squirrel. There is a sqweaker in the tail and body. She frequently cuddles it to sleep. It's holding up pretty well for a stuffed animal.
4,Not a squeaker,"A great toy for my dog, precisely because it DOESN'T squeak. It makes a honking noise (presumeably because it's a goose) which still gets my dog excited, but doesn't annoy me. Moderately durable. A dog that destroys other toys will do the same to this one."
1,Worst toy in the dog's toybox,"The squirrel lasted less than 48 hours. Generally the least expensive stuffed toys from pet stores last 3 to 4 months before the fabric rips. My dog likes to ""kill"" the toy, have someone throw it, retrieve it, play tug-of-war and start the process again. In a matter of minutes the fur was coming off. After the third or forth ""kill,"" stuffing was flying all over the living room. Never have I bought a toy that fell apart as quickly as did this squirrel. I will sew the rips and see if we can get another few hours of play as my dog really liked the toy."
2,Not Boston Terrier Proof,"We gave this to Lola, our 1 and a half year old active Boston Terrier. She loved it immediately. She chases squirrels in the yard, so we thought this would be a good substitute. It does look like a squirrel, have a nice crinkly tail and a nice squeaker.But, within 15 minutes, she had surgically removed the crinkler from the tail. Another 5 minutes, and she removed the squeaker. She managed to do both without removing any stuffing (she's talented), but that was next.The weak point of this toy is that the big, bushy tail is stitched all the way from the squirrel's rearend to halfway up his back. So, a dog that's apt with his or her forepaws can easily hold it down and rend with her teeth (which is exactly what our dog did).Lola loves stuffed toys, but they don't last long. I would pay good money to get her a toy she could love on that would last more than two months."
3,Not very realistic,My dog goes balistic every time she sees a squirrel so I got her this for Christmas. She just looked at it like it was stupid and went on. It was not enough squirrel like for her I guess. The sound that it makes though entertained my 3 year old cousin though for hours.
2,Doggie hedgehog,"Our Greyhound Andy has a big hedgehog like this one. It is his favorite toy. Another dog got a hold of it and now its squeaker doesn't work any more. We bought this one, not realizing that it was smaller. He prefers to play with the big one, although he misses the squeaker. This one is too small for him. The quality of the toy is excellent, it is just too small for our Greyhound."
2,chipmunk dog toy,"Really cute animal, but surely there is a way to keep these toys together! My dog (25#) tore into it almost the first day in order to get to the squeaker. I was really hoping to find a toy or brand that was more sturdy, but this isn't it for our dog."
1,pittsburgh steelers ball cap,"Inside edging of seems opened already, materal rubs head and is uncomfortable."
4,"Good hat, good price, excellent shipping!","The hat is an authentic Reebok product. It is exactly what they said it would be. The price is good, but you may be able to find it cheaper if you are willing to shop around town. The shipping was fast and reasonable."
2,zzzzzz,This play was overcooked with bad actors and costumes. It was too long. I gave it a three time try and fell asleep each time.
3,rating David E. Talbert's Mr. Right Now.,"It was okThe singing was good. The meaning behind the play is much needed for today. Women need to pay more attending to a man's actions , his heart and not just his looks and wallet."
1,Mr. Right Now,"This movie had a lot of bad acting, which was a big distraction. It was not worth purchasing. It was a very slow movie, and took forever to get to the end of the movie."
2,I found it to be boring,I couldn't get into this play. I'm not expecting every Black play to be like Tyler Perry or anything but I did expect it to be at least catchy during the first half. The jokes were corny and I didn't like the acting.
2,dissapointed,"I bought this program thinking I could make nice slideshows with transitions and effects to play on my dvd player (vcd). Unfortunately transitions and effects don't work when you make a video cd, when you go to broderbund help page they tell you that's how it's supposed to be. If I had known that I would not have gotten this program. I gave it two stars because I suppose if you're just using it to make e-mails or cd-roms it would work all right."
4,Review,academic book which provides a serious overview of where our nation started. Discusses significant issues as well as bringing up issues not normally mentioned in regards to the Federalist Papers
1,The content belies the title,The author is indifferent regarding the development of masculine characteristics. The positive reviews seem to be from readers who sought the book because it reinforces their own predisposition to raising children androgenously. That does not make this a good book.
5,An excellent case for allowing feminity in males.,"Silverstein presents facts and figures illustrating the damage done to, not only males but humanity in general, by the tendancy in our society and others to push boys toward activities designed to foster a sense of ""male-ness"" in them.She recommends, instead, allowing males and females to find their own gender path. This, she contends, can have a humanizing effect on our society. She also gives case examples where reuniting men with their mothers, in other words, giving them permission to love and accept love from each other, freely, has had a curative effect, not only on those involved, but on the family as a whole.I was so impressed with Silverstein's theories, I plan to design a college study around her work. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in gender issues. It also serves as a strong counterpoint to the so called ""men's movement."
4,Raising Boys,"My two children are boys, but they are 24 and 26! So why did I buy this book, you ask? A friend and I were recently discussing how our culture has different expectations for men in terms of showing emotions. She mentioned this book ... so I bought it. I also feel that I am still in the process of parenting my sons, so I figured more information would not be a bad thing.This book has a lot of examples that show how subtly we treat boys differently from girls that give them (the boys) the message they have to be STRONG. The author also talks about how our culture empasizes the need for a ""strong, male authority figure"" in a young boy's life. This is fine until the culture also diminishes the value and importance of a strong mother.The only reason I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 is that the examples the author uses are somewhat dated -- Karate Kid for instance -- that current young mothers may not relate to."
5,"The naked truth about love,sex,and relationships","This book is the truth and nothing but the truth!Everyone should have this book.It is a true reference to life as we live it.Before starting any relationship,one should read it.It touches so close to home,you wont be able to put it down.My Advice to you 'GET YOUR OWN COPY"""
5,SOMETIMES THE TRUTH HURTS!!,"Why Do People Choose The Wrong Mate? How Do You Avoid the 9 Deadly Booby Traps? Just read this wonderful, engaging and compelling book by Gillis Triplett! I loved this book and I applaud him. I wish I could have written it myself. What makes this a great book rather than just a good one that says things that I happen to agree with was the passion in which Gillis delivered his message. Also, Gillis' investigatory efforts seem impeccable; nothing within this page turner reads as implausible conspiracy theory about why we choose the wrong mate. People everywhere who desire to have lifelong partnerships owe it to themselves to read this book ASAP! Thank You Gillis Triplett! I just hate it when BIBLICAL PRINCIPALS get in the way of perfectly good rhetoric [smile]"
4,Cute!,"Our little boy LOVES this book! He carries around the bear and bottle, feeding the bear and offering the bottle to me and the dog. We read through the book at bedtime as he is winding down. The book and all the little pieces seem quite durable, as they have held up to many weeks of being carried around and chewed on. Good value, full of imagination potential!"
3,A little bit of everything,Good overview of most aspects of the breed. Not to specific or detailed. There must be better books out there Update those 1970's photos...ugh!
3,Good book but too much info on agility.,We want to get a German Shepard so I thought this would be a good book to get info on the breed. It did give a good history but I found it too much info on agility corses. We just want a family dog and are not going to be doing extra sporting training.
4,Science Fiction Dentist Comedy,A Sci-Fi about a dentist who is kidnapped and forced to perform his services on alien beings that are not from this world. Book was fun to read and funny.
5,The book that turned me on to Piers Anthony,"I originally read this book when it was new. Browsing an airport book stand for a sci-fi to read, the jacket design caught my eye. I followed this with reading the blurbs: ""Can a mild-mannered dentist from Earth make it in the high-powered world of galactic dentistry?"" Sounded like fun. I was completely unfamiliar with Piers Anthony's works before this. He subsequently became one of my favorite authors."
2,Not one of his better books,The story is drawn out which causes it to become boring in places. Think it could have also done better with less dental details.
3,3.5,"I liked this book for the first 100 pages--though they were all about wedding preparations, with some cultural and family history. But then my attention started to wane. The next 200 pages were so ""subtle"" (enigmatic? esoteric?) that perhaps I missed the point in my struggle to keep reading. The story seemed to slow to nearly a stop, and I got bored. I didn't particularly care about Layla, Sameer or her family. Perhaps if I knew more about Indian culture, this book would have held my interest.It's worth a read anyway, because parts of it are interesting.I enjoyed ""The Village Bride of Beverly Hills"" by Kavita Daswani much more."
2,Tedious and unfocused!,"This book is just tedious. As soon as one storyline started to get interesting, everything would screech to a halt & it would shift directions. The lack of a glossary of terms was very confusing for anyone not familiar with Indian culture. I wish I had given up by Page 50, but I just kept plugging away in the hopes that it would get better. Basically it's the story of a girl who lives in America & India who agrees to an arranged marriage & then doesn't want to deal with the outcome."
4,A must read,I personally would recommed this book to anyone who is interested in cross cultural battles faced by this generation. Layla on one hand wants to live life with freedom and on the other hand is bound by customs and traditions. This book not only gives us an insight into the inner turmoils a girl could go through but also makes us aware that as girls we are ready to go to any extent to live up to the traditions and cultural standards set by our ancestors & elders.
5,Good book club choice,"Good first novel; I would have liked a little more detail on the wedding (when were they actually considered to be married? what was the significance of some of the customs?) and explaination of some of the terms used, and a little less repetition of some of the other details of Layla's past. I enjoyed learning about the culture and the Hindu/Muslim conflict. This would be an excellent choice for a book club as it supplies much to discuss."
1,No meat,"Gies and Gies provide a superficial treatment of medieval life, with the work lacking scholarship to provide it with any substance. The only benefit to this book is that it did lead to others trying to provide a true perspective."
3,"Well sourced, but doesn't read well.","Renowned scholars of medieval history, the Gies credentials are impeccable. However, in this book, they seem to relish in providing piece after piece of redundant references, notes, and other bits of trivia to tirelessly pound the reader into submission as they seem determined to impress with their knowledge and research capabilities. If nothing else, the work provides the reader with a comprehensive bilbliography and reference list of places to go if they are that interested in life in a medieval village. The result of this style is a dry work that ofter reads like paragraph after paragraph of a census roll or register. It's dry, it's well researched, but it's dry. Oh, did I say that already?"
2,Lifeless,"On the positive side, this book contains an enormous quantity of well-documented detail and scholarship. On the negative side, the writing is colorless and, to my eye, devoid of any unifying theme. Even someone seriously interested in the history of the period will find it soporific. Having struggled to the end, I still cannot decide if the juice was worth the squeeze."
3,A bit dry but very informative,"Gies&Gies discuss the nature of an ""open field"" village, which was a distinctive feature of the ""manorial"" or feudalism (more or less). It was not just a small town; the nature of the agricultural and legal systems made it unique.Lots of material, and well worth reading, but occassionally dry and pedantic."
4,History being made.,"A fascinating book of all sorts of interesting information of this period from work routines and marketing to medicine with it's bizarre remedies and treatments. Did they work or is it just survival of the fittest?Religious life, superstitions and education are also covered from the perspective of being written in the 1200's."
2,Thick and strong-scented,"Maybe this would make a better hand cream than night cream. The scent is eye-wateringly strong, and the stuff really gloops on thickly. I used it for about 3 weeks, and then it started to irritate my skin (to be fair, my skin seems to be very sensitive). Avalon makes good products, but I'm not a fan of this one."
3,Might cause allergic reaction,"It is thick and moisturizes well. However, something was causing an allergic reaction. Every time I used it, my face was burning, so I had to stop. My friend tried it too and had the same problem."
2,Product has changed,"I used to use this cream for years and it was the only one that worked well on my skin. I loved it! However, since the company went under recent changes to ""update"" their products, this cream has not been the same. It has a different texture, and it burns my skin and makes it completely red. I do not have sensitive skin. I have never in my life had a reaction to a product, and I've used many types. I am saddened that the chemistry of this cream changed. Poor move Avalon Organics."
5,Great Moisturizer!,"This is a great moisterizer. It's very light and not greesy on your face at all. It works instantly on dry skin. I love the smell, and the fact that it's Organic!"
5,In love with this product!,"It's fragrance is very nice and light, it's organic, and it WORKS on even the driest skin! Need to order a larger jar!"
3,"good ingredients, but sticky","for some reason my skin doesn't love this product as much as I thought it would. This cream smells heavenly, the ingredients are good, but it did nothing for my dry patches, and I couldn't use it in the morning (too sticky). I love the brand, especially the cleanser in the same line, but this is a little bit of a let-down. I'll finish it but will not repurchase."
