3,"Some fun grooves, but inconsistent","Fever In and Fever Out is the best place to start for folks unaquainted with Luscious Jackson. This album has some high points, but is nowhere near the quality of Fever"
5,GOODASS,"I LIKE ALL OF LUSCIOUS JACKSON'S MUSIC. PARTICULARLY THE NATURAL INGREDIENTS CD BUT AGAIN PARTICULARLY ALL OF THEIR CDS. IT HAS A NYC JUMP ROPIN AND SPASTIC FIRE HYDRANT KINDA FEEL. THE MUSIC IS FUN AND LYRICS ARE SERIOUS AT TIMES. SUCH AS ""FIND YOUR MIND"" AND ""STRONG MAN"". SONGS ARE NOT HATEFUL BUT OBSERVATIONS OR PERHAPS FIRST HAND EXPERIENCES. IN ANY CASE THEY ARE TRUE. NOT AT ALL BITCHY. LJ HAS ISSUES PROBABLY LIKE ANY GROUP THAT HAS SOMETHIN TO SAY BUT IT DOESNT GET IN THE WAY OF THEIR HAVING FUN AT WHAT THEY DO. WHICH IS MAKING GOOD MUSIC."
2,Split after 3 months,"I was delighted with this board -- so beautiful to look at and great to work with. However, the board split on me after three months. I purchased the Totally Bamboo oil from the beginning and carefully kept the board oiled as instructed. I only handwashed it immediately after using. I'm not sure I'm willing to take another chance on this product -- will look for a more reliable board."
5,Couldn't be happier after owning it for 15 months,I bought this block 15 months ago. Since then it has sat on my counter and has been used frequently but not daily. I give it the occasional mineral oil treatment when it's looking dry but I haven't babied it. I am very impressed with how well it has held up. Except for a wine stain it is practically in the same condition as when I first got it. It does have a great solid feel to it when you are chopping away on it and it stays put on the counter due to its weight and the rubber pads on the feet. I really can't even come up with a minor nitpick about it.
1,LOOKS FAKE!?!?,"I ordered this cutting board because of the beautiful customer photo and the excellent reviews. But to me, this board looks like a wood cutting board with a printed ink parquet pattern on it. The board came well wrapped, and in decent but not perfect condition and seems sturdy and I would have loved to use it.... but ... it looks completely fake?!!! Is the even real bamboo? I am not convinced, so I am returning this. I have decided to try a teak cutting board which is a completely renewable resource as well and which naturally repels water. Teak is used in boat making. Check out a review for the proteak 20x 14 board with the bowl cut out. It will arrive tomorrow, I will try to review right away.ALSO, Amazon returns - - when done through amazon approved companies, are a piece of cake! It has been easy and no questions asked. Thanks Amazon~!!!"
1,Hmmm,"I beleive htat the person above was paid to write that review. This is a horrible, contrived piece of target market media that will do nothing to better your life."
2,Defective,"Didnt read any cds.I decided to use it only with usb drives. Didnt work either. I emailed customer service, they said the usb is only for drives of 512 mb or less!! I only have 1, 2, and 4 gb drives.So it only worked for fm radio, and i have to plug my mp3 player through the audio input to listen to my own music. Thats the only way i could use it. I cant return it or anything since i live outside the US."
2,Not a good product,"If you don't care about sound quality or features and just need a simple receiver to play your music from CDs or USB flash drives this is good for the price. However, you cannot expect this to have the quality of other more expensive brands."
5,The Breast Ultrasound 'Bible',"The main reason I purchased this book was use it as a review before taking the Breast Ultrasound registry. The authors (Stavros/Rapp) are respected in their field, and I have attended their conference lectures. The overall size of the book was a bit intimidating at first (nearly 1000 pages). On the plus side, the images are outstanding. The image descriptions duplicate the text word-for-word, which really helps to cement the facts in your head. The chapters are formatted very logically, even if some of them are nearly 100 pages long. In my journey through the book I found only a couple of minor typographic/editing errors. If you are reading carefully, these won't be a problem. This book is now firmly planted in my office as a reference. Oh, and by the way, I did pass the registry! Kara Chickering, R.T., RDMS, RDCS, RVT"
1,I didn't find this book helpful at all,"Having ploughed through this book, I would not recommmend it at all. There are far more superior books on this topic available."
2,Screws wrong size,Couldn't find handels anywhere local. Handels fit perfectly in exhisting drill holes BUT the screws that came with the handel did not fit.No hardware store around had screws that fit. I'm in the process of calling the company. really Frustating !!!!!
5,Ms. Ghilardi,"Excellent service! The item was exactly the same as pictured, came in the mail promptly, and fit perfectly. Thanks!"
3,shower door handle set,The handles were 1/16 inch larger than stated so i had to drill larger holes in my door. Other than that they work well.
3,It was ok,It is ok...not challenging at all...very basic. Have done it once. I just go to my normal classes and modify
3,not for experienced yogi's,"I thought this would be nice to do in between my weekly prenatal sessions. But it is so terribly dumbed down. and it is not challenging in the least bit. I dont get any extra stretch, or any extra exercise out of it. I get more of a workout taking a flight of stairs. This may be good for someone who is very out of shape."
4,Groovin',"This album is what pop music is all about. While it may not sit on your personal ""greatest albums of all time"" shelf when you're 60, its melodies will stay in your head and intoxicate you despite your best efforts to ignore them! The Kostars are really two members of Luscious Jackson, Vivian and Jill, with backing support from other LJ members and, strangely enough, the Ween brothers. The music is dominated happily by acoustic guitars and keyboards that create a mellow, summery feel. In keeping with the LJ style, the duo features more songs about strong women--always potent without being preachy. (Hint: the Kostars/Luscious Jackson know a lot more about ""girl power"" than the Spice Girls do!). While many LJ fans will turn to this album out of curiosity, some will realize that ""Klassics with a K"" is the best project to come from any LJ member(s) to date."
4,Beautiful Harmonization,"If you're looking for a good album to mellow out with or do some work to, this is it. The harmonization on it is beautiful and the accompanying lyrics are catchy enough that you'll probably find yourself singing along to it. It's also great for setting the perfect mood ;-)"
3,PUP TENT,"IT WAS OK , BUT NOT SO FRINDLY TO TAKE OFF OR PUT ON , BUT YOU CAN GET OUT OF THE COLD AND RAIN. MIGHT WANT TO PUT ON RUBBER BOOTS. GOD BLESS JD"
5,ATV Cab.,These ATV covers are well manufactured and help tokeep you warm while plowing snow.It was also a very good transaction.
5,atv cab,it was nice it came fast i like it must have if you live in wv love it.it came in camo it better then the pic thank you match my atv good :}
3,"Ok,but could have been a little better.","It is a awesome figure it has it's goods,and bads.Pro's:He comes with the NWA world beltHe has a good head scanHe is almost in scaleCon's:His Guitar peices might get lost easilyHe has a action.That's it and thier isn't anymore!"
1,Lackluster product,"I was hoping for much more. The unit I received had a problem with the CD player door. It had to be pulled to open fully and popped every time. The radio has an analog tuning dial that is very hard to adjust to the desired channel. The ipod dock navigated well, but there was a clicking in the audio. The overall audio quality was very tinny. I returned this product."
3,iPod player with remote,"We bought this as a birthday present for our daughter. She has loved it. It came with a remote, which she uses all the time. I rated it as a 3 as the CD player doesn't work (disc spins, but no sound comes out even though input selection is set on CD), however I haven't bothered to replace it as she doesn't ever use the CD and doesn't want to be without it if I were to ship it back. The sound is good and she uses it daily-teenagers and their music... Price was better than others I found too."
3,"Great tank, utter garbage light fixture.","This tank is great, price is reasonable and build quality is great. The light fixture it comes with however... Just toss it, don't try to fix it, just toss it. Be prepare to shell out another 100-200 for a good light fixture. Seriously, don't even try to use the light fixture, just toss it and thank me later."
1,Never received item,"I purchased this item for my 8 year old sister. Supposed to be a Christmas gift but it kept saying ""not yet shipped"" then the next thing i knew it wont even on my ""bought items list."" So I have never received this item. I know I purchased this because it took it off my debit card...BAD ITEM, BAD SELLER, DO NOT BUY. unless you want to lose your money!"
3,Needed tape to keep closed.,"Purchased this for a baby dwarf hamster. The size is perfect, but the two halves didn't connect securely. It split apart within 10 seconds of use while it was attached to the stand it came with. The problem was easily fixed by applying scotch tape to the seam where the two halves connect. We didn't need to use tape on the end cap, as that connects & stays closed just fine."
4,It's a great tote for a cheap price.,"The tote looks professional and classy. It has a thin compartment for your files, and pockets for your cellphone, cards and pens. After putting your laptop inside, there will still be enough space to put your personal belongings, such as your wallet, makeup-kit, a paper notebook, etc.I only have two wishes:1. That the top was zippered2. That the bag had an additional padded divider to put my laptop in on one side and my personal stuff on the other.Not having a neoprene case for your laptop would mean that it might get scratched if you put other things on your tote.All in all it's a good tote for the ~$30 price."
4,Targus Tote,"I enjoy my bag, but it's hard to fasten because my laptop doesn't allow me to close the flap."
3,"Good on Price, OK on quality",Its an OK case. Its neither good quality nor is it good looking.But it serves the purpose.Buy it if you dont wanna spend more on a better case.
5,my personals ad,"I want a man that appriciates the sentimintal and creative values of Ween's Chocolate and Cheese album. There is nothing better than Morcheeba & Pot, except for this album and any narcotic of choice. Sobriety is even blissful in its essence.How could you possibly pass up such classics as ""Mister, would you please help my pony"" which sounds amazingly similar to ""Mister, Would you please hump my pony"", and old time favorites reminicing about the cajun land such as ""Voodoo Lady"".This is a must for any serious offbeat collector."
4,not for the faint of heart,"This band is a laugh and a half. I can always count on the brothers Ween to lighten up a dull day or get me through a long road trip. They are my guiltiest guilty pleasure and I can't help but feel I really *shouldn't* like them as much as I do. In fact, most people roll their eyes when I admit that I like 'em. But how one does not crack up at tracks like ""Voodoo Lady"" and ""I Can't Put My Finger On It"" is far beyond me. Ah, well. In closing, don't buy this if you can't take a joke, the rest of you feel free to ""boogie, boogie, boogie."""
5,brown saves lives,"it was summer of 1999 or 1998, me, p and the kids all gathered at the corner and it was a special day because p brought with him sacks loaded with homegrown shrooms. ""here,"" says he, handing me about 3/4 of an ounce of dried psillocybin, ""these are for you."" i eat a couple and he says, ""no, eat the whole thing."" this is probably the second or third time ever i'd dosed shrooms, so i take the whole bag. needless to say, within an hour the walls were bleeding and every cop on the beat knew i was high and were out to get me--so in desperation i went over to debbie's apartment, cg's girl, and she, cg and i listened to this album over and over for the next few hours while i hid in a fetal ball under a comforter on her ratty couch and smoked hash. later on i went to see ace and the rager's at the old grog. thanks, gene and dean, for pulling me out of my hellish bad trip.also, this is the best cover ever. screw any humorless birkenstock wearer who says otherwise!"
4,Wonderfully Eclectic,"Don't know what you are in the mood for, put this album on and leave it up to Dean and Gene. This album is truly all over the map, with many enjoyable twists and turns. While some of the lyrics may set you back at first, you'll soon find yourself embracing even the most disturbing songs for the gems they are."
4,The roses are free,"Ween is the only performer that can make me laugh and groove at the same time. And the best thing about them is they probably have an album that more or less fits your favorite musical syle. Of all the records Ive heard, this is the most diverse, and by all accounts their best work todate. I highly recommend this one, and Painting the Town Brown for anyone looking to check out Ween."
5,Funny at first...,"I use to laugh hysterically at this album. ""Freedom of '76"" and ""The HIV Song"" were, to me, hilarious; I was practically rolling on the floor. When I listened to the song, ""Buenos Tardes Amigo"" I didn't laugh. I did, however, really enjoy it. I happened to be walking to a store, and the seriousness of the song made buying stamps that much more of a purpose; mailing will never be the same. Also, ""Spinal Meningitus (got me down)"" is starting to grow on me as a cool song.My point in all this is that I used to listen to this band as a novelty, but I have found that they are somewhat respectable musicians, and I have to give them props."
5,Musical roller-coaster,"When I first heard Ween I was a bit iffy about their wackyness, but after a couples of listens you can't help but realize their musical genius. This album I think captures their creative peak, combining excellent musical composition along with great lyrical expression of their fun and wacky personalities. There is not one song that slightly resembles another. The musical themes cover such a wide range that leaves you amazed at their creativity. A bit of Ween goes a long way to making your day a better one and this is the album that garantees that."
1,Why I'm not buying this CD,"I love the song Liberty Bell, so I was getting the details before requesting that my local library buy it.However I'm so sick of album covers that exploit women. The cover design is totally demeaning.So it's not getting requested or bought. There's plenty of great music to listen to that doesn't use offensive artwork as a cheap (and totally uncreative) tactic to push sales.(Yes, artwork is part of the album content!)"
4,"To Be The Best, Learn From The Best !","John Graden offers the ONLY alternative to learning the martial arts industry the hard way. Mr. Graden has done most of the mulework for you in this text. He shares common faults of martial arts schools and prescribes solutions that will not only stabilize your business, but help it thrive. Instead of struggling for years making the same mistakes as our predecessors now we have a motivational reference."
3,Purple is not even close to being purple,"I'm not sure what Fran Wilson thinks purple is, but purple (which is maroon in the tube) comes out bright pink. It's not even close to being a purple hue. I have purple hair and wanted lips to match, but this is clearly pink. The lipstick is great. It doesn't rub off and lasts a while. I like the lipstick, but not the colour. I'm going to try getting black cos I see that that one comes out purple. We'll see how it works.Update: I've tried nearly all the colours. They all come out in different shades of pink. Some are lighter, some brighter some with a darker hue, some more purple, some more red, but all are pink."
1,Mood lipstick,I thought this was a green lipstick but its a mood lipstick it doesn't change colors either just a bright redesh pink color
1,This is NOT green lipstick,"This product came up when I searched for ""green lipstick"". It is green-colored chapstick that does not color your lips green."
1,sucks don't buy,color sucks. it stains everywhere. hard to come off. i bought the dark blue and ugh so disappointing. does not show blue at all. very cheap just got it and lipstick snapped in half already.
2,Not what I thought.,"I bought this thinking that it would GO ON light blue--the color of the lipstick. However, when I got this and tried it on, it went on as a red-violet color.As a warning to those looking for lipstick that goes on blue THIS IS NOT what you are looking for."
2,Not as I had hoped,"This lipstick did not turn out as I had hoped. The color does change as it goes on but on me, it just became an ugly color. It was also not as moisturizing as I had hoped. It might work on another person with different chemistry, but for me it was not a good purchase. I just threw it away after a couple of tries."
5,Great deal on long lasting lipsticks!,The mood matcher lipsticks last a long time without being dry like many of the more standard long lasting lip colors. They are very inexpensive and a great deal! I have a selection of colors and would recommend trying them all to see which you like best or just to have different colors. Fast shipping by seller too!
2,Did not work for me.,"I purchased this product thinking it contained aloe vera, I was wrong and returned it. I found a beauty supply that sales the aloe vera lipstick I was searching for."
2,Moodmatcher from Fran Wilson,"The purple is more fuschia colored. I had to wipe off and then it was still on the rims of my lips, so when I put my brown lipstick on, i had fushia rimmed lips :-("
5,Best Lipstick!,"I love this lipstick. Long lasting, anti -smudge. I have been using it for years and was very happy to find it here on amazon after it was no longer being sold in stores. Green and brown are my favorites as they turn into sublte shades of pink and red. Sometimes I mix the 2 or mix with a lipgloss if I want to affect the colour a bit."
2,Hardly anything on the Tu-4!,"I was very disappointed with the lack of info on the Tu-4. While the book is comprehensive, it lacks detail on the plane that the Soviets used to literally springboard their aviation industry forward in design and manufacturing. Considering that many of the aircraft covered in the book didn't even appear in the form of a flying prototype, while the Tu-4 was a production aircraft, I consider this a glaring omission! Merely referring to another book in the series that covers the Bull in greater detail struck me as either lazy, smug, or deceptive. Perhaps all three. I can't and won't recommend this book to my fellow aviation buffs. Sorry, close but no cigar..."
2,A suprisingly accuarate title,"There is one rule of thumb in buying Beasite Boys records, and if your new to the Beastie's camp, then you need to know this: avoid anything that is predominatly hardcore.Sure, there is some hardcore stuff on both ""Check Your Head"" and ""Ill Communication"", but there's also really cool jazz and rap songs on those.""Some Old Bulls**t"" compiles two early seven inchs from the Beasties sub-par Minor Threat days, as well as the ""Cookie Puss E.P."", their first foray into hip-hop, which is little more than the Beastie's making prank phone calls over a mediocre tape loop.Sure, fans may get a laugh out of this, but not even they should want to keep this record."
2,Not worth it,"I bought this cd about 6 years ago mainly to complete my Beastie Boys collection. It's made up of stuff that they recorded before they were signed to Def Jam, meaning that it's mostly punk. If anything, it is kind of interesting to hear where they were back in the day, but the music isn't very good. You can hear the beginnings of hip-hop in their music in ""Cooky Puss"" in the fact that it had a beat and some amateur scratching, but the song is really just a series of prank calls to Baskin Robbins. If you buy it, don't expect to actually be listening to it much."
4,Cookie puss was the best track,Most of the cd is good but they are not good at punk rock. Cookie puss was the best track.
5,This CD rules,"This CD is only 28 minutes long but, it is good. Some of these songs are from the Polly Wog Stew EP. Then the group was Mike D., Adam, Kate and John. Now they are Mike D., Adam Y. and Adam H. These tracks were available before bu went out of print. The songs have also never been available on one CD. Buy It."
4,Old School Beastie,"If you like old school punk, then you will love this CD. This is from before the Beasties were about hip-hop, and from this CD you can see where there rock roots come from."
2,To complete your collection only,"Buy this CD to complete your collection, but be aware the sound is very poor.The title says it all. If your a B-Boys fan you should have almost if not all released albums."
5,Great,"This is a great CD, even if you don't like the Beastie Boys. It's short, but great. Holy Snappers, and Transit Cop are the best tracs on it, if there is a best."
4,Fine hardcore punk from... the BEASTIE BOYS?,"Yes, the Beastie Boys' first musical venture was hardcore punk. Three chords, teenage angst, and potential. Adam hadn't joined yet and the band was comprised of Adam Y., Mike D., John, and Kate Sellenbach as a PUNK band. And despite the fact that they can't sing and that they're only about 16-17, this is a cool album. Egg Raid On Mojo's without a doubt the best song on the album (with a little three-note solo even!), with Beastie Boys as second. Worth a listen to go back to the BB's roots."
3,Old school,"The hardcore tracks on this disc from the Polly Wog Stew EP are freakin' great. The songs are completely rambunctious, immature, high-speed hardcore punk. Before the Beasties were MTV darlings with their suburban-friendly hip hop, they were playing house parties and small clubs with GREAT bands like The Bad Brains, Minor Threat, etc, etc (they even go for a Minor Threat look on the back cover of the EP). Like I said, these songs certainly don't show any maturity or songwriting skills to speak of, but they're fun, and you have to respect the Beastie Boys roots (they were still covering Minor Threat songs and recording new hardcore tracks a few years ago...). The reason that I only gave this 3 stars is because the Cooky Puss is generally pretty boring. Sorry, but I just don't like these last 4 tracks. To each his (or her) own."
2,This is James S speakin' here and this is what i say,"if you like the beasties because of their hip-hop and cool lyrics, dont buy this album. it only 30 minutes long and most of the songs really blows. the name of the album explains the CD. i didnt waste the $$$ on this becaue it was a gift. if they didnt have the skit cooky puss, i would of gave it a zero!!!!If you want a good CD by the Beasties, Get Ill Communication----it rules!!!!! if you are a great beastie boys fan, lets talk about them and other stuff."
2,you are not the beastie boys,you are not the beastie boys you kidnapped them and made a cd i love the beastie boys you guys stink and sing weird
2,Not so good,Tim Lahaye is supposed to be a bible scolar. Well He thinks Jesus was born in Palastine. My Bible says Jesus was born in ISRAEL and Grew up in ISRAEL and taught in ISRAEL and JUDEA. I think LaHaye has been listening to too much Arab TV This story has not held my attention at all. I will not be buying any more of this series.
1,Fundamentalist nonsense,"I trapped myself into this thoroughly silly book by checking it out from my public library, having forgotten who Lahaye was. I won't reprise here what other reviewers have said about the preposterous Noah's Arc premise. Suffice it to say that Lahaye's tiresome advocacy of creationism, which I infer stems from his belief that Every Word in the Bible is Literally True, has no place in a work of modern fiction, it seems to me.Unless you are a deeply committed fundamentalist Christian, I suggest you stay far, far away from this one."
3,just ok,It's too preachy for me. I would enjoy the story line and then come to a screaching halt at the preaching sessions. I would read some and then put it down and then read a different book then pick up this book again and continue on.
3,Disappointed.,"Where ""Babylon Rising"" actually inspired me to pick a Bible and read the to Book of Daniel this book didn't inspire me to read my Bible at all. The story was okay but tended to get bogged down with the side stories about the relationship issues among supporting characters. I look forward to the next book but hope that it will inspire me more."
1,Bible Thumping Nonsense,"In this latest piece of tripe, Lahaye uses a thin plot as a pulpit for his evangelical crusade. If you don't have time to go to church, this will certainly fill the gap. However, if you are looking for a read that doesn't insult your intelligence with its contrived plot, stiff dialogue and ubiquitous attempts to bring the reader around to the ""right"" way of thinking, you should buy something else; anything will do. An absolute waste of money."
3,Like it much better than the first book until the end.,"I hate sloppy endings and that what this one has. It is much better written than the first, and I would have given it 4 stars if not for the ending (which I won't reveal). I was turning page after page and then I got to the end and well, I was disappointed. Again, as with the first book I learned some things, I would read and verify theories. I formed my own opinions about the Ark and while I don't agree with all of Mr. LaHaye's conclusions, I do agree with others. This series is a good idea I just wish the characters, especially the ""bad guys"" were a little more believable and the ending hadn't been so sloppy."
4,Good book,"As I said in the previous reviews of all the Tim LaHaye books that I have bought, which is well over 15.They were all for my granddaughter, who is in her ""twenties"", and she's read them all.I am not an avid reader, so I don't know about them personally.I take her word for it, that they are GOOD !!"
5,The Secret of Ararat,"This is a great book!If you are a fan of Tim Lahaye, or a new fan, this is a must read!"
1,I had to stop,"What utter tripe! I'm afraid I just can't read this. I've tried but I can't get past the inanity of the first few pages. Firstly Murphy's fighting for his life in an underground river and he stops to help 2 little puppies Awwwww. Whay a guy. Next he's using his enormous lung capacity (over 2 minutes we're told he can hold his breath) to enter the freezing water to save the drowning puppies. Awwww. What a guy. Of course he saves them. Just. He's nearly out of breath and he's in the first stages of hypothermia. But what are we told the puppies are doing at this stage? Happily playing! Not drowned or hypothermic themselves. They are happily playing. Finally in total darkness his hand brushes a piece of wood. Most of us would think 'it's piece of wood' Not Murphy... he just knows it's an historical treasure! Back to the lab where test show it's 5,000 years old. Murphy says with infectious enthusiasm ""it must be a piece of Noah's Ark"" everybody agrees and I throw the book in the bin."
4,Synopsis,"(taken from back rear artwork of case)If you need convincing that motorsports are dangerous - Watch This!The production team at Videovision Broadcast, renowned for their wide coverage of international motor sport, present a thrilling one-hour compilation of the most spectacular, unusual, and indeed frightening, accidents from the world of motorsport.

3,Nerds will love this movie,"if you were a dweeby nerd in the 80s and got beaten up by the jocks all the time, like Booger was, you will enjoy this movie. It will bring back memories of how lame you really were in the 80s."
2,Crossword/Soduku on line,"Not quite as good as I had expected. Works, but I won't use it. Too clunky."
5,Good towels,"Towels are very large, soft and well-made. they look like they will last a long time. I would buy them again."
2,They Feel Cold,"I bought 2 sets of these last year given the reviews and the fact my family only uses oversized bath sheets. They're very thick and soft, but everytime I use them, even a year later, they feel cold when you wrap yourself in them. They don't feel absorbent. It's very disappointing on a cold day to step out of your shower and feel chillier when you wrap the towel around you. My wife can't stand them despite their thickness and size. I should add that the bathroom is the warmest room in my house and we don't get that chilly feeling from our other towels. It seems to be just these."
5,Real Movies,"Not your current fare of hyped up, computer generated, special effects gone wild type of film. This movie has screen legends of days gone by in a compelling true story.I have seen most, if not all, of Jimmy Stewart's films and don't recall anything he had ever done that he wasn't believeable in. June Allyison, with that foggy voice, was only one of my boyhood sceen goddesses. What can you say about Agnes Moorehead - only one of the great character actresses of the ""greatest generation!"" And, you have four of 1949's professional baseball players apearing as themselves, including Bill Dickey.A true love story that will lift all boats!"
5,"Versatile, very strong yet lightweight, removeable wheels are a big +","Notebook Laptop Carrying Case. Accepts 17"" laptopsLots of pockets including pen, business cards, etc.Hold down strap for laptop.Great salesman or pilot case or for traveling.Heavy duty lock.Horizontal and vertical handles.Reinforced corners."
5,Exactly what I needed for my FBA class.,Only up to chapter 5. So far it seems to have a lot of information required for my course work.
5,Good Information,I found the information in this book to be applicable in my course and workplace. I would recommend this book for anyone who work with children who have behavior issues
3,"Great Textbook, Poor Binding!","The textbook is well written and is an excellent resource for behavior management. However, the spine quickly broke and the pages are falling out (I ordered the book in Jan. and it is early March)."
2,Behavior Management,I got the book on time it did not take alot of time for me to get the book. I knew that I got a use book but I did not think that the book was going to be in the conditions the book was in really bad conditions.
5,Nappy Does It Again,This album is top notch. Every song is very good and there is not one that I skip.This album is betta then the first!
4,Great CD,"I thought this CD was really really good. And for the person that said they mentioned Kentucky too many times, you're wrong. I'm from Kentucky and I think it's great that we're finally being recognized for something besides country music. But this really is a great CD."
4,"good, but not as good...","The new Nappy, long anticipated and somewhat over rated. No disrespect whatsoever to the boys from Kentucky, but nothing can top ""Watermelon, Chicken, and Gritz"". There are some good tracks on this cd, but not nearly as many as on their ""debut"". They didn't use hardly as many distinguished and catchy beats on this album, and really that was the first thing i was looking for. A few songs show their old style, but not many at all. ""Nappy Roots Day"", ""Lac Dogs & Hogs"", ""Roun' The Globe"", ""What Cha Gon Do"", and ""Roun The Globe (Collipark RMX)"" are the best songs on the cd. ""Twang"", an amazing track, will catch your attention if you are looking for the kind of stuff from their first album. Personally, i was disappointed when ""Peanuts was not on this cd. Still a good buy, but if you are looking to choose, ""Watermelon Chicken, and Gritz"" is the one your gonna wanna take."
5,they did it again!,this cd is non-stop from beginning to end i didn't even skip one song...that's rare better than the last album
2,IS this Nappy,This CD sounds like they just wanted to get mo monney.W.C.G. was tight W leather is not.I wish I never bought itMOB
2,Waste of money,"Apart from 'Round the Globe', this album is very dissapointing, wish I had spent my money on something else."
3,Not as Nappy,"Nappy Roots are lyrically solid. This album is no exception. Unfortunately, it does not live up to the standards of WCG. The Country Boyz put out an album that lacks decent beats. Songs like ""Start It Over"" and ""Headz Up"" are missing. There are some hot songs like ""Twang,"" ""What Cha Gonna Do,"" featuring the Ying Yang twins, and my favorite ""No Good."" Some songs have stupid hooks like ""Lac Dogs & Hogs."" This song would be better if it were instrumental. Overall, they have stuck to their roots, but it is not as nappy."
3,Not a good follow up to WCG,"This cd is not even close to as good as the first one..It seems as if they are tryin to get soft on me...It sounds more like an R&B cd if anything. Watermelon, Chicken & Grits was definately the better of their cds. I think they shouldve put more faster paced songs on this cd. Overall its not too bad just not what i expected after WCG!!"
5,Keeping it Dirty and Southern,These boys are back again still representin the dirty south and putting Kentucky on the map. This cd is well worth the buy becuase every song will keep your head knockin. Make sure you check out the Collipark Remix with tha Ying Yang Twins it will be the next bump in the rump at da club
2,Not their best effort,"I was a huge fan of watermelon chicken and gritz and was really looking forward for this new album. But i was disapointed with this one. There's really no catchy tunes or beats, and lacks the orginality of their last album. It has too much soul in it for me, i was hoping for more of a raw c.d."
5,Wonderful,"Could watch it over and over. Just wish it were longer with more of this amazing mans life story. If you want to know more of this beautiful soul...just read his biography; 'Story of Edgar Cayce: There Is a River, by Thomas Sugrue'. You'll be thankful you did."
5,Sheets 300 t/c,"I AM ""VERY"" PLEASED WITH THE SHEETS. THEY ARE VERY SOFT AND COZY.I AM REALLY HAPPY I FOUND THEM AT THIS PRICE..VERY VERY CHEAP AND EXTREMELY GOOD QUALITY."
3,scratchy,"These sheets are very well made and look great if you iron them. They are very wrinkled coming out of the dryer and are very scratch to sleep on. My husband has complained every time he has to sleep on them. They have deep pockets and heavy elastic, but too stiff. I don't think they are perma-press. The design is very pretty when ironed, but who has time to iron sheets. Very thick fabric and will never wear out (too bad)."
1,It's not worth the time and money...poor quality,"Hi,The color does not look the same and the quality is not good...Its not worth the time and money on this product at all.The sheets get wrinkled and don't look anyway close to the picture.Very disappointed.Atmost they are not worth 80 dollars.Probably i could get better quality sheets from a local stores with the same price here."
3,They soften the more you wash them,"The first time I washed these I was horrified bc they were very crisp & wrinkled. After a few more uses they became much more enjoyable. The quality isnt first rate but for the money, they are worth it."
4,Great Punk,"This album is punk at its best. Any true Beastie Boys fan should have this in their collection. All the tracks are awesome. The CD is sadly lacking ""Soba Violence"" which appears on the import."
4,"If you like their ""punk"" rock tracks, you'll love this!!","This EP includes 8 new punk rock-style songs from one of the most innovative groups of the 90's. Although the songs are relatively short (the entire EP runs at just over 11 minutes), they are all full of the energy and creativity that only the Beastie Boys can create. I give this EP four stars"
5,Beasties Rule!,"Just read the latest Rolling Stone, the front cover reads Beasties Rule! Rolling Stone rated the Beastie Boys 'Artist of the year' and last year, MTV gave them the Vanguard award for lifetime achievment! This cd is excellent! Buy it!"
2,Beasties Don't Hit Par,"The Beastie Boys are definitely one of the most innovative groups in the business. However, Aglio E Olio doesn't express their true talents. Sure, they have come out with some nice little hard rocker songs such as ""Time for Livin',"" where they turn the bass and everything up to full blast. It has become a side trade mark for them, but it is not their cliche. To any Beastie Boys fan, they might as well pick this album up, just to say they have the album in their collection. However, it is not a true demonstration of their talents. If there was less rock and more hip hop, 40 additional minutes, record scratching, and slower tempo rapping, Aglio E Olio would be a success."
1,Terrible,"This is just a horrible beastie boys cd. If you like hardcore/punk music, this is the cd for you. If not, don't get this."
2,"Nice Novelty, but...","...this isn't something that compels you to listen to over and over again. The Beasties were third-rate punk rockers anyway, and time didn't improve them in the punk area. Stick to the stuff they do best!"
2,dvd was scratched to the point where I could not watch all of it!,The DVD was scratched I had to skip chapters. Movie was not as discribed! Very fustrating when we where trying to watch it.
5,Highly reccomended children's book; bound to be a classic!,"The illustrations are very unique; page layouts are fascinating to children without being overwhelmingly cluttered.The storyline moves along quite smoothly and easily keeps a grasp on the under-developed attention span. Also, every parent will be enthusiastic about the value lesson that Muffy the Dragon instills - very little is more important to a child's development than a feeling of self worth and a capacity for friendship."
3,Not that soft....,"When you first pull them out of the package, they feel very, very nice and soft, but after you wash them, then feel stiff.No matter what I used, different laundry soap, fabric softner, etc.. nothing worked to make them soft again.I would not recommend these if you want soft sheets. I will continue to use them, they are not horrible or anything, just not what I expected."
3,Not spectacular-but worth the price,"These are just fine for the price, however the striped bottom sheet along with the flowered top seems a little odd and gives the set a slightly cheap look. Soft, but not super soft. Definitely worth the bargain price though."
4,Good sheet set!,I gifted this one to my friend and she's always in praise of this one :)It felt very soft.
4,Classical and Comprehensive of traditional ALM,"This book can serve you as the authoritive summary of the traditional ALM issues and techniques. It doesn't only describe the concept we should consider, but also educate the details of the ALM tools. Though this book doesn't deal with hot issues such as VaR and stochastic term structure model, it contains the essential ALM theory and practical technique you must know before diving into the frontier of ALM."
3,Handbook on bank asset liability management,"This is a good primer but out of date in 2005. Since it's last printing, banks have been burdened with SFAS 133 which substantially changes the rules of the road for hedging assets and liabilities. An updated version certainly needs to tackle this challenge. Also, banks have expanded the types of assets they will buy, such as CMBS, whole loans, and raw loans. On the liability side, structured financing has become a critical tool in a bank's ALCO toolkit."
5,bad cat - great fun,this book is adorable.. my 2yr old loves bad cat! we want some more adventures please
3,See Jane Date,I bought this DVD because I am a fan of Charisma Carpenter. However the picture quality was not good and I wasn't sufficiently involved in the drama. This DVD is no more than an inoffensive distraction for a quiet sunday afternoon.......
2,Charisma is capable of far better acting,"Drivel. I'm a 40 year old woman and I like ""chick flicks"" when they are good. I loved ""You've got mail"". But this? This was just drivel. Badly written, formulaic boring plot, and obvious ending with the very stereotypical idiot boyfriend prospects and supportive friends.You want to watch funny interactions between the sexes, watch Friends or BBC's coupling.You want to watch Charisma ACT? Go rent Buffy and Angel. Watch Veronica Mars.Charisma did her best to be Mary TYler Moore, but in the end, she was an unbelievable character who I'm supposed to believe as a wallflower. Yeah. Right."
5,"I ""Promise"" this cd is going to be a hit!!!!","When i heard this single ""Promise"" i couldn't believe it was Ciara. It got stuck in my head since the first time i heard it. She coming back strong, grown, and more sexy with her 2nd CD. Can't wait until it comes out, it will be on my collection with the other R&B artist. She is doing her thang!!!!!"
1,Broke in a few weeks,You would be better off buying a higher quality charger. This one broke very quickly. I would not recommend this product.
3,Doesn't quite fit,"The case is nice. But of the 10 or more Motorola RAZR cases I have bought this is the only one where the openings for the front LCD monitor didn't line up with the one on the phone. You can see most of the screen, but not all."
5,Grandson Happy,This was given to my Grandson as one of his Christmas presents. He opened it and started jumping around. He loved it and although his wrist is small in size it fit him. Made one young Bruin fan very happy.
1,Drivel,"The Paris Agreement was doomed because no agreement of this kind can survive without enforcement. Congress wanted Vietnam to go away, and when they cut off all aid, South Vietnam did go away, as well as Cambodia as we knew it.The DRVN had no reason to honor the agreement once we legislated that we would do nothing about violations."
1,Do not purchse if you really plan on jogging with the stroller!,"Bad purchase! I jogged for a 1/4 mile with it and turned around and went home to look into returning it. Mine does not stay completely locked into position while it's open. It is off balance and wobbles terribly. My husband adjusted the front wheel several times and it finally alligned straight, but you cannot ajust the back wheels. Both the front wheel and back right wheel started to buldge durning my short run. There is about 10 inches worth of storage space behind the seat. It was big enough for me to only put my dog's leash in it. I would definitely invest in a better brand if you are really planning on jogging with a stroller. Walking and park trips with this stroller would probably be fine, but I do not reccomend it to actually jog with. On the plus side, I do like the colors! They are not as bright as I was expecting."
1,beware non repairable parts,We were given an instep jogging stroller as a gift and loved it until one day it refused to fold. The latch on one side would not release. My wife runs mostly from the house and this stroller had been folded less than 10 times.The side latch that broke is inside the frame and cannot be repaired even by the bike store (this was confirmed by customer service). Unfortunately the stroller was six months out of warranty and instep will do nothing to help. I called and the bike store called and the company says no warranty no luck.This part is innacessible to replace and as I said the stroller had been folded so few times I am very very disapointed with the product and this company and will never buy from them again. For such an integral part to fail is a real shame.
1,Not for me or my child,"This stroller is not for little toddlers and definitely not for babies in arms. It swam around my daughter when we got it at 6 months and it was only after she turned one we could use it at all. The shoulder harnesses don't hold her in now that she's grown more, and they're adjusted so she's pinned against the back of the stroller. She just slips her arms out the sides. The lap harness is hard to fasten. You HAVE to raise the front tire if you want to turn, and the front wheel has always seemed a little off balance, no matter what I try. I would not recommend this stroller at all."
4,nice running.,I have enjoied this running stroller. I ues it 4 times a week. great price great product.
2,not a weight limit of 75lbs,i ret this item as soon as it arrived bc the box itself said only up to 50 lbs...i have a 3yr old who already is tall and 40lbs...we go for 3-5mi walks and i wouldnt spend that kind of money on sumthing we will not get much use out of...so be careful when reading the product descriptions they are not always accurate
5,The best transaction I ever done,"I already had this stroller and knew how great it was, so decided to get one for my brother in-law. It arrived the very next day even though I had the slowest shipping. the quickest all round transaction I have done on Amazon."
3,It's just ok....,"...and would be better if the front wheel wasn't fixed. It's ok when you need to go straight but turns are a pain! I'm not using it for jogging, but walking on different terrains, works great in sand/grass, not so great on pavement curves! Will never purchase fixed wheel stroller again."
1,Just a Dictionary,"I was really disappointed to pick this book up and find that it is a dictionary of media terms. Although it includes just about every possible media term out there, I expected more from Mr. Surmanek in terms of an updated version of his first book. Sorely disappointed. Returned the book and will continue the hunt for a great teaching book for beginners in the field like myself."
5,Great dictionary- no need to invent terms!,"This dictionary is complete with contemporary business terms in Spanish with their English equivalent. This dictionary is a handy reference for those who need to know and understand business terms in Spanish as well as keep pace with neologisms that come into the language especially from the technology sector. The vocabulary is very contemporary and includes abbreviations as well that are included in business documents and letters. The middle of dictionary includes a business correspondence section with sample business letters, resumes, email vocabulary and other handy business correspondence references. This dictionary would be most beneficial to those who use Spanish in a professional capacity, advanced learners of Spanish and those who simply want to speak correctly using proper business terms at all times in Spanish. This is a worthwhile investment."
4,"A fine dictionary, but a bit dated.","As a business translator I have been using this dictionary and Wiley's English-Spanish, Spanish-English Business Dictionary for several years now, and together they would get the job done for me. As each year went by however, there would be more and more terms that I could not find in either dictionary.Happily, a few months ago Webster's New World English-Spanish/Spanish-English Business Dictionary was published, and now I have access to over 80,000 entries and over 100,000 translations! Its 2006 publication date insures that it is completely current.Now I only use Webster's New World English-Spanish/Spanish-English Business Dictionary. And I use it every day. All the time. So, my recommendation is to buy Webster's New World English-Spanish/Spanish-English Business Dictionary, and perhaps in a few years, also buy the new edition of The Oxford Spanish Business Dictionary whenever it is published."
4,Great product,"I don't know why people are so upset about this product. It's great. I teach guitar and this is awesome when I'm working with students. I can just put a chord or two on an index card with some information and it's really great as a teaching tool. Also, when I'm working on writing out songs that I've written (singer/songwriter stuff) for a band I can just use regular music paper and then stamp the chords above the rest of the notation and I've got a chart with guitar chords. Voila! I for one really like this product. And if you don't stamp perfectly straight...so what? If you want perfection then line up the rubber part with a little ruler or something. Otherwise relax and enjoy a really neat little product."
3,Cheap and not so cheerful,"As per other reviews, why didn't they use better glue? The stamp was not straight on the wooden mount but a bit of superglue fixed that.Lines are a bit too ""fat"" for such a small stamp and they could have used better cuts to get a better/more defined grid.It was cheap and serves the purpose but could have been better"
1,Sloppy Workmanship,How do you screw up such a simple product? Simple ... glue the stamp onto the the wood block crooked.
3,"doesn't cost much, image quality not great","well, I've used it a couple of times, it doesn't look like it was printed , the impression that is on the paper is somewhat fuzzy.Maybe I'll get better at it along the way. Doesn't cost much anyhow, and should do the job OK"
4,Need an inkpad!,"To be frank, I haven't used the product yet. In my rush to order I neglected to note that the purchase was sans inkpad :(Based on the product's construction, it appears as though it will work as advertised."
4,Offensive? NOT!,"Exactly what did Mr. Maltin find offensive in this film? A homophobic learning not to fear people different than himself and actually coming to care deeply for another human being? Or that it portrayed a homosexual loving a straight man in a non-sexual context and not changing the orientation of either character? Perhaps he thinks O'Neal's character should have been ""outed"" or Hurt's should have been ""converted""? God forbid that two people with such divergent sexual orientations should ever be portrayed as being able to co-exist as just friends. I happen to think this was a very good illustration of two people coming to care for and respect one another for who and what they were."
4,Funny and worth watching.,"Steriotypical, yet funny and respectful depiction of two police officer who are partners trying to solve a murder case in a gay community. One officer is gay, the other straight and they go undercover as a gay couple to solve the murder.I really enjoyed this movie."
4,light hearted fun movie,"If you want drama, don't get this movie. If you are in the mood for a laugh and don't want to work hard at watching something, this is it. Enjoyed it, kept me entertained, didn't have any slow parts, all this and I didn't have to think hard about it. Have fun with this movie...and don't take yourselves too seriously."
2,Very dated for this day and age...,"The movie handled this touchy topic well enough for it's time period, but now it feels very dated. There are some nice moments, such as when the straight cop finds out what it's like to be on the other end of the prejudice spectrum, from the inside. However, it really annoyed me that all the gay charactes were portrayed as complete stereotypes: drama queen or leather daddy. There seems to be nothing in between."
1,Not reccommended,"Poor design, poor user experience, had to return. Vendor was really helpful in handing returns and refund, will give them credit for this. I ended up buying a 100$ Apple piece - five times the cost of this item - and what you pay is what you get."
2,No video!,If you are planning to buy a cradle with video functionality dont buy this item. It's only for music
3,Okay,"I was misled (on another website) into thinking that this product has speakers. It does not - it's just a docking station. Be forewarned!That being said, anyone know any compatible speakers I can hook up to the USB port or any other way I can make it play through the docking station without a computer?"
3,Find a product that meets your standards,"Hi, the Robomaid isn't that bad. Really its only good for floors that have dirt and dust, but not really for anything bigger or else it will just get pushed around. And if you have a dog thats playful he might tear it up lol.[...]Thank You and Good Luck"
3,Russel's Review,I like the Robomaid so far. My complete satisfaction will depend on how long the rechargeable batteries are going to last. I have used it every day since I received it. It has 750 square feet of tile floor to cover and I now have a relatively dust free floor. How long is it expected to run??
4,Compelling Human Drama,"After her highly acclaimed Emmy nominated performance in The Burning Bed, Fawcett made this compelling telemovie about the relationship between a wife and her mother in-law, and how they eventually reach common ground and love after the elder woman suffers a devasting stroke.The superb late lamented Colleen Dewhurst drives the movie with a commanding performance as the mother-in-law from hell. She is at once hateful, tragic and sympathetic in a role that won her an EMMY for best supporting actress.Its a travesty that Fawcett was once again overlooked as she matches Dewhurst scene for scene in a deeply nuanced study. The movie is played out in flashback...and is absolutely essential viewing for lovers of 'human stories'."
3,"Review of ""Flying the Oceans""","""Flying the Oceans"" is a superbly written story of one pilots' experiences in Pam Am's early days. The author flew the intial Pan AM flights to Hong Kong and South America, starting in the 30's. As a graduate of Yale and Harvard Law School, who gave up a partnership at a major law firm to achieve his desire to fly, his adventure is inspiring, well written, and full of trenchent observations about a vanished, exciting, way of lfe."
4,Great Diesel Engine primer,"This is a well illustrated overview of several brands of diesel engines. The book explains required maintenance, problem diagnosis, and ways of prolonging marine engine life in a clear and unambiguous manner. This is a book I will keep on board."
5,One of America's best educators,"On November 25 2001 Margaret Rawson died at the age of 102. I'm privalged to have known her. At 101 her mind was as sharp as ever! She will be well remembered for her work dealing with dyslexia. She will be missed. God bless you, Mrs. Rawson!"
2,IN TJHE MIDDLE OF IT,OKAY I HAVENT FISINED THIS YET. BUT I AGREE WITH THE OTHER PEOPLE. THE BOOKS PULBLISHED AFTER VC DEATH ARE ALL THE SAME BUT FOR SOME RESAON I LIKED THEM ANYWAY. DOES ANYONE WONDER WHY VC WROTE SO MUCH ABOUT INCEST I MEAN DID SEE EXPERINCE AND GOT OUT HER PAIN BY WRITTING.
5,A really interesting book.,"I love this book! Some reasons are because it's realistic, and the characters are interesting. I also liked it because of the really great ending. I would also like to add that I would definitely recomend this book to anyone who likes to read."
2,too unrealistic and un- V.C. Andrews,"This book was alright, but this miniseries thing is just too not V.C. Andrews, and what these girls go through just would not happen. Had V.C. Andrews herself been alive, she would not write any miniseries at all. They are too short and not worth the effort of writing. The best books were the Flowers in the Attic series, the Heaven series, and My Sweet Audrina. This ghostwriter should either go by his/her own name or write in a more V.C. Andrews style."
1,FINGERNAILS ON A CHALKBOARD!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have to agree with Paintball. I used to like V.C. Andrews' novels, but since Andrews' death and the assumption of her role by ghost-writers, there has been a steady decline in the quality of her novels, they have become more and more soap-opera-like, more trashy and whining. It makes me want to scream, it really does. Perhaps these novels should be geared towards a Junior-High age group; maybe I'M reading the wrong material, but I think the best thing to do is let poor V C Andrews rest in peace. PLEASE!"
2,Unlikely events and a stupid plot,"I'm a huge fan of V.C. Andrews' early works, but lately these ghostwriters have really unrealistic plots. The first four Orphan books were good not great, but this one was the worst.You steal a car, run away, and do what with your lives?The girls get into all kinds of odd situations and the ending is just worse. They go through all this hardship and, like all her ghostwriter works, happy ending for everyone. The second worst V.C. book I ever read."
3,Good but not Great!,"My overall impression of the book was: Good but not Fantastic. It was well-written and easy to read. The story was very predictable, but at the same time enjoyable. The four girls share a bond between them that makes the reader become very interested in their lives and all the things that happen to them. Some of their adventures are a little far-fetched and corny. The girls have been through some hard times together, yet everything always seems to turn out O.K."
2,way too unrealistic,"I must admit that many parts of this book were quit entertaining, while others were just corny and just plainly stupid. Like one part, Crystal, an orphan suffering often from some kind of nervous breakdown, the friends get together in a circle and recite some chant to get her out of her trance saying stuff like ""we are sisters, we can do this, your problem is all our problems"" and so forth. I also found that the orphans were to different to realistically be that good of friends with eachother, each one had nothing in common. I also thought that they just did not reflect enough on the average foster child. The writer obviously does not have much experience with being abandoned and should not be writing books of this nature."
2,Unworthy of VC Andrews,"What was the deal with that Butterfly girl? Am I the only one who hated each and every character? If you want to read real VC Andrews books- go get My Sweet Audrina, The Flower in the Attic series and Heaven- or re-read those. Otherwise don't bother. And why do all the the characters in all the books have this wacked ideal of california?"
1,"Good, addictive..but not V.C. Andrews!","Okay, so I loved the book. I totally devoured it. It was good. But, somehow quite dissapointing...it just wasn't V.C. Andrews. I mean, I don't think 4 17 year old girls would be foolish enough to run away when they didn't have any severe problems. THen doing really stupid stuff that I seriously don't think they'd do. I liked the book, but I want the old V.C. back, not this poorly-written, teenybopper type mess."
5,V.C. Andrews does it again,"I read the first 4 books when they came out. From the time I finished Raven, I searched everywhere for Runaways. I was thrilled with the way the series concluded. As another reviewer said, I hope there will be more books about the girls as adults."
3,Very diasappointed,"I have been reading V.C.Andrews since I saw the movie version of ""Flowers In The Attic"" and ever since I was hooked. I have read all her books since and I remain a big fan. I have to agree with other reviews that the books have just not been the same since she passed away. I don't think that the ghostwriter should stop writing books, I think he/she should just think of more original plots instead of recycling the old ones. ""Runaways' was very dissapointing. It just ended so abrubtly. I would have liked more books written how how they lives would have progressed, such as Raven's actress career, Brooke's marriage, and Butterfly's love life. I feel that the mini-books were much better than ""Runaways"". I have just started reading the newest book from the Logan Series ""Olivia"". So far so good."
5,It was abosolutly awsome and I have read that whole series .,When this series came out I read all of them as soon as they came out. I had to have them and find out what happened to each girl. It was a powerful series that let me discover a whole new type of writting. It wasn't your typical teenage romance or you have problems and by the end of the book she has her perfect life back. It was awsome and I'm glad she is writting The Wildflowers now. It is just as good as her first series and not as descriptive and mature as her other books. They are absolutly perfect reading material for me.
2,Disappointing in plot and presentation,"I had hoped this book would be done in alternating points of view from all four girls (like If There Be Thorns). Instead, Brooke is our narrator, and the reader is limited to her perceptions. The other three girls become typecast by their personalities (the wimp, the brain, the troublemaker) and we lose the intimacy we had with them in their books. Also, I hope the plot was meant to show that runaways are on a one-way street to nowhere, because that's how I felt while reading it. Not the thrilling finale I was hoping for."
5,This book is Great!!!!!!!!!,I loved this book. If you liked the rest of the series you will love this one too. (Maybe as much as me.)
2,Ignore the first four!,"Okay, this one isn't too bad, still doesn't read anything like a V. C. Andrews novel but wasn't a total waste of time. The first four mini-books were absolutely pointless, if you must read this series at all, just jump to Runaways."
2,Certainly not one of her better books!,"As a collector of V.C. Andrews novels I will say that since the passing of Ms. Andrews, her books are not as compelling as they once were. I used to find it hard to put them down once I started to read, but now I read them just to give myself something to read. I will continue to buy the books as they are released, though, just to keep my collection up-to-date."
4,Runaways,"When my grandmother loaned me this book, I expected something very different than what I got. For the better. As a teenager, I can relate to the girls in the story. However, I found one minor flaw; it was a little unrealistic. But I enjoyed reading it, and I intend to read the rest of the books in the series."
2,"Not The Best, But Good","This book is not the best. If you really want something good, go to the Flowers in the Attic, Heaven, Melody, or Ruby series. Those were the best, along with My Sweet Audrina. I mean, the new stuff from this ghost writer is dropping quality wise. The older stuff from the ghost writer was okay, but oh well. Ya can't have everything. Email me, because I really like getting email that's not junk... We can chat about V.C. Andrews or something..."
5,A perfect development of each character,The Runaways did what I hoped. It took the characers from the mini books and put them into a plot that developed them further and brought them into three dimensional reality. I hope they consider a series about each girl as an adult. Wow!
2,Had been hoping...,"that Neiderman would have gone back to his usual good work after this. The Cutler and Landry series had been good books, and I have no idea why he decided to write this miniseries. If something is classic - and VCA was - then stick with it! This story of the Orphans was a mildly interesting read, more for teens, and not a good representation of the VCA name. The ending also felt rather rushed together, and the novel overall was very, very cheesy, especially with the hippie character. The Orphans series certainly didn't represent Mr. Neiderman's best work and we had hoped it was temporary, but sadly, the VCA name would NEVER be the same again... and it's even more evident 10 years later. :/"
1,Very not happy with Amazon's system,I wish I could see the closed captions or subtitle for profound deaf/hard of hearing audience. Amazon has failed to meet the ADA requirements.
2,thought it would be great...,"Thought it would be great for splitting aome knotty wood, however after a few swings the weld that connects the handle to the head broke. Maybe it wasnt designed to be swung like an axe. I may return it or just reweld it. A friend of mine has the same maul and loves it."
4,Jumpin for joy,"Fantastic footage of Fats. All the classic old tunes. Can't help but put a smile on your dial or a bounce in your step. Bought it for my dad, but the whole family bopped along to it."
5,Excellent movie and highly recommended,The movie arrived in just two days and was wonderful. You will absolutely love James Stewart and Henry Fonda in Cheyenne Social Club!!!Very pleased with service and shipping speed!!! Love Amazon!!
3,not some of james stewart's best movies,some of these movies (the naked spur and spirit of st louis) are a complete waste of time. The FBI Story is enjoyable but full of fbi propoganda and not centered toward what actually happened.
3,"The excellent, the good - and the not so good!","James (Jimmy) Stewart was one of the truly great actors of the the screen. His reign was long and honourable - as was his life, generally, especially during WW2. Stewart deserves every superlative, for his acting and this 'collection' does nothing to tarnish his reputation as a superb and accomplished actor. That said............The problem with 'collections' is that, invariably, not each of the components please everyone. Everyone has a different opinion, about any form of art and, especially, story writing.This 'collection' contains stories that do not greatly impress the writer - along with firm and much loved favourites.If one admires Stewart - and who doesn't - this collection is worth a 5 star, plus, rating. However the fact, that in all liklihood not all the films will be to your particular pleasure, forces me to afford an average rating of only 3 stars.'Collections' have their drawbacks - for the consumer!"
2,Not a B2B book at all,"It is very hard to find valuable B2B literature around. Because of media hype and market valuations it seems (until last year) everything written in eCommerce was about B2C models. However, times have changed and now we are looking more into B2B as the saviour model of eCommerce.I bought this book convinced it was a B2B book but it isn't. At least 50% of the chapters and 50% of the ""examples"" shown correspond clearly to a B2C text. Maybe the worst part is that they are so mixed you start to loose focus on what you wanted to read the book in the first place !It is a nice ""general eCommerce book"" but will never be a classic on B2B. If you want insights on B2B look elsewhere...."
1,Not Up to Par,"Sorry, neither Terry nor Ellen portray very believable charachters in this debaucle and try to overcome it by gross overacting. An interesting plot premise that really wasn't done justice."
5,Pack of Lies,This is a very good movie. Ellen Burstyn and Teri Garr give excellent and believable performances. I first saw this movie on tv years ago and never forgot it. I was absolutely thrilled to find it on dvd.
4,Classic from the early days of quantum mechanics,"Although published by Dover in 1984, this book dates back to about 1930, when Weyl was the big proponent of group theory in quantum mechanics. Because of this date, much of what modern books on group theory would include, is absent from the book. It mainly discusses the permutation group. The book is, however, of historic interest, as Weyl (mathematician) tried to convince the physicists to exploit group theory - which even gave rise to some irritation (""group pest"")."
5,Please create an audio adaptation ...,To the publisher I would appreciate it if the publisher could produce an audio adaptation of this book. I would love to listen to this while I drive to work and to let my 16 month old son listen to it as a bedtime story. Arnold D Veness
4,THE COMPLETE BOOK OF NECROMANCERS,"THIS IS A BOOK THAT CAN VERY QUICKLY BRING BACK SOME BALANCE TO A CAMPAIGN THAT MAYBE THE CHARACTERS ARE A LITTLE TO STRONG. THE DARK ARTS ARE POWERFUL INDEED, AND WITH THE HELP OF AN EVIL POWER (GODS, DEMONS, POWERFUL UNDEAD ECT...) NPC'S CAN GIVE YOUR PARTY REAL FITS, THIS IS ALL DRAWN OUT AND VERY EASY TO ACCESS IN THIS HANDY LITTLE BOOK. UNDEAD ARE COMMON TO AN ADVENTURING PARTY AND HAVING SOMEONE OR SOMETHING IN CONTROL OF THEM ADDS A LITTLE FLAVOR IN THE GAME. AS PC'S THIS BOOK THIS ALSO COMES IN HANDY IF YOU WANT TO PLAY A CHARACTER THAT HATES UNDEAD. ON A FINAL NOTE, THERE ARE SOME HANDY SPELLS AND POWERS (NEAT EXTA BONUSES AND PENALTIES) THAT AD A REAL TWIST TO A CAMPAIGN."
3,Bugs Vs. Sam,"Yosemite Sam still is the most known Western irate in the history of cartoons. Still not being honored respectfully, he only has two video collections to his full credit.The 1993 video, Yeller Fever, was the final video collection reflecting Yosemite Sam. Created by Friz Freleng, the video contains five of his cartoons, only being known as a arch villain to Bugs Bunny. The cartoons remain whole and zany in full respect. Four of the five cartoons, only coming to video just one time : Hare Trimmed, Southern Fried Rabbit, This Is A Life?, and Hare Lift, a remake of Falling Hare, a Bob Clampett cartoon. The other cartoon, Bunker Hill Bunny, was previously off the 1985 Warner Bros. video, A Salute To Friz Freleng.While many of us still jeer Yosemite Sam, his style and humor helps keep our Western style of comedy, a full moon ahead of newer varmints."
4,Fast and speedy,"The drive is wonderful to use! There is no CD with the package as the software autoruns from the external hard drive - a nice feature that saves time and is more convenient. No need to drag around CD's to all the PC's that you use this on.I have used this as a depository for ever-changing files by dragging and dropping and have used it as a backup tool.As what another user said, speeds can very depending on USB connections. My Belkin USB hub slows it down considerably and will essentially use up _all_ resources on my computer - making it inoperable (unplugging it from the USB will fix that), but plugging the drive directly into a USB 2 port on my computer doesn't have the same effect.More than likely, it is the hubs that cause the slowdowns."
2,As a back up device........,"The mini unit works well with my Compaq desktop and uses the USB 2.0 at a fast transfer rate. However, for the first time owner of a bkup unit, Maxtor offers no manual, no ""how to use the software, step by step"" text or graphics. Left in dark I found NO help as my emails went to India, with poor returns. A flashing light( LED ) that never stops, could not be answered, so I'm stuck with that defect. So, lets say POOR SUPPORT from Maxtor & Company."
3,Minimal Mac support,"This drive does work with a Mac but the pre-installed backup software doesn't.Also it's billed as a USB drive but it doesn't seem to work reliably with USB 1.1, hanging a couple of hours into a large file copy. Granted it's painfully slow to make full use of a drive this large with USB 1.1 anyway, and it seems fine with USB 2.0 but given that one of the laptops I wanted to use it with only has USB 1.1 I probably would have bought something else if I'd known.Other than that, after a few days of use it actually seems like a pretty good drive for the price. It's not too big and draws power from the USB port so there's no separate power cable to worry about."
1,Poor quality and design flaw,"Pros:Cheap - I bought it for $34 at staplesCons:Quality or Design flaw - it uses TWO USB ports, I have never seen any other manufacturer require two USB ports, you could try to use one port, it may or may not work. For me it never worked, it seems it couldn't get enough power and just hang the computer."
4,plug and ready to use,"The drive is working great so far, I bought it in december. The outside of the drive can get dirty fast I would recommend a pouch otherwise the drive is very easy to use."
2,Unreliable and of limited usefulness...,"The drive is not reliable, whether plugged into one USB port or two. It will sometimes beep suggesting that it needs more power, but on other occasions, it works just fine. I can't seem to figure out a pattern. I did send the drive in for replacement, but the new unit that Maxtor sent back is as bad if not worse than the original. Yes, I've tried the drive on multiple computers, but the problems are the same. I'm not sure what to do with it; I'm seriously considering taking the drive out of the enclosure and putting it in an old FireWire enclosure (I'm guessing that the disk is just fine...)."
2,Locked Up,It may just be me but I have had a lot of trouble with this devise being user friendly it locked my computer up and had to be disconnected to get anything done.
2,It took 41 hours!,I have 1 GB of RAM and a Pentium processor and Broadband service. Normally my computer is pretty darn fast in all things. It took 41 hours to back up my C: drive. That amounted to 12 GB of data. After the back up my computer practically ceased to run. I unplugged the unit; no help. I finally had to uninstall all the software for my computer to return to normal. It has been a nightmare. All the info is securely stored but I can't imagine what it would do if I ever actually needed to use it to restore this to my computer. I really wanted to use the sync function but since I can't keep it installed that is not possible.
3,Opening the vault,"This is the first in a series of archival releases from the NRPS vault of live shows. It features the classic line-up in its prime, with special guests Keith and Donna Godchaux from the Grateful Dead. Donna's best moment is her lead on ""You Ain't Woman Enough,"" but, as in the GD, her harmony on ""Long Black Veil"" is violently off key. Apart from the Godchauxs, the biggest selling point for this release is the song selection, live versions of which have not previously appeared on official releases. However, some folks may be a bit disappointed with the sound quality, which is no better and maybe worse than the few live releases on the Relix label several years back. Nevertheless, it's great to finally see some movement on the NRPS front. Here's hoping for more!"
1,Not what you think it is,This book does not follow standard theology and was so bad that I threw it away.
5,Excellent vampire story,"Albeit you could think that this story will scare you I really don't think so. That doesn't mean that this book isn't eerie. But in case you don't like vampire stories it'd be better if you don't read this one, but you'll regret that.Since the start of the book till the end of it you won't be able to put the book down. That's a fact and even if you don't like chupacabras' stories read this one. You'll enjoy it."
4,Boats for Boys and Girls,"When my son was little, this was one of his favorite books. He never got tired of looking at the pictures of all the different boats. The bright colors and easy-to-look at illustrations were perfect for his attention span. The words are printed in bold black letters, making letter identification easy. Now that my son is a teenager, I still give this book for a baby gift-it's terrific!"
3,"Good, not great","This is a commendable effort to introduce children to general science (not just physics, as the title might imply), but there are minor flaws.In SI units, the degree sign should not be used with celsius. In Light, a prism is described as a 3-sided piece of glass (5 sides or more). If you go up 8 white keys from C you come to D, not C. An object is said to be red because it reflects only red light (pigment makers wish that were true, but it isn't). The air column in a woodwind vibrates only under closed holes. (What happens in cross fingering? Don't the vibrations extend into the room?) And I wish text weren't printed over dark illustrations!"
4,1g stick kicks ass!,"I bought this for my psp, and it's been great for that. I can fit tons of music and video on it and watch untill my eyes bleed. The only disappointment is that while using the adaptor to make it larger like the old memory stick pro, is that it doesn't work with my sony digital camcorder.. the stupid thing can't seem to handle to capacity. Sony, why are you trying to make me neurotic? But this stick is good and does what it does."
1,Not Compatible,"I bought this item specifically for my PSP. But it was not compatible even though on the front of the package it said ""PSP COMPATIBLE"" I was pretty pissed because after I inserted it into the memory stick slot, some errors started to occur when I tried to copy information from my old 32mb memory stick onto my new 1 gig. It started to freeze and then I couldn't add or delete files from my psp. So I called in Sandisk and THEY SAID ""Please check with Sony because some of the 1 gigs are not working with the PSP"" So I thought to myself.. hrmm maybe false advertisement? YES. I am not some lamer that goes on giving bad reviews on products I do not have. I can assure you I have a working 1.5 US PSP and I too am trying to run homebrew files. But how can you run homebrew when you can't even copy files ONTO the PSP? Definite waste. I would NOT recommend this to anyone purchasing this only for their PSP."
3,Uncompatible,"Yes it is a great bargain for the MB versus dollars, but it is not 100% compatible with all Pro-devices. Unable to download or move files via the MemoryStick Pro slot on the Vaio Sony computer. The only way I can download is to have the memory-stick in a device such as PSP or camera and then move the files via USB. Not an efficient way nor convenient way since it would be easier to use the memory-stick slot. What is the slot for anyway then? It works with all my other memory sticks, but not his one. Manufacturer (SanDisk) not any help at this time and too costly to send back."
3,I'm about to buy it but still unsure....,"Sorry , this is not a review but rather a question and not even about the product itself....Most reviewer talk about how good the Sandisk 1Giga Pro Duo works in their PSP.....Not being an American and not knowing all the techno lingo , please , can anyone tell me what a PSP is ...? ( something to do with the Play Station..?? )I just bought the Sony DSC T 33 today and as I'm going on a wild trip very soon I need to buy enough memory so I can shoot all the pics I want. This 1 Giga Memory Stick Pro Duo has the bestprice-MB relation , the 1 Giga Sony Red Memo Stick Pro Duo I want is not available and heaven knows when it will be .... So....Lexar has no 1 Giga , so there's no big choice....Either Sandisk for U$ 119.88 or the Sony for US 367.00 or so.....Well... anyone can still tell me what a PSP is...? I'm going to buy this Sandisk Memo Stick right now....."
4,Sandisk 1 gb memory stick,"I had the memory stick sent to a friend and have not had the opportunity to use it. The friend was unable to get the camera to work with it. Shipment was prompt. I'm not sure that the camera can use the 1 gb stick, but wanted to try it anyway."
4,Works for me,"You can probably find a similar product at a cheaper price, but I trust the quality of SanDisk. The Pro Duo is a great upgrade and works wonderfully with my Sony Digital Camera! In general, I've found that the memory sticks record faster than memory cards."
4,Good Memory Stick,Item seems like any other memory card to me. To my knowledge this was a good purchase and I'm happy with the product.
4,Good stuff for the PSP,"It transfers data faster than a regular sony 1gb stick, the difference is not noticeable at first but when you start to download anime or movies into the stick, the data transfer is quicker. Plus its a bit cheaper than the sony product."
5,its a good one,The product is awesom and I am more happy with the way they packed.Overall its a good product thru amazon.
1,Not Compatible,"Even though the front of the cover says PSP Compatible, I've called Sandisk and they've said ""check with sony for firmware updates because the 1.0 gigs have a problem with the psp"" so I've though.. false advertisement? what? don't get this for your PSP. doesn't work and freezes up after I tried putting my files from my 32mb card over to my new 1.0gig. My psp version is 1.50 and none of the files can damage my psp. They've all worked with my 32mb and it should have worked since many reviews online states Sandisk is better than Sony. Maybe Sony got jealous? Who knows. Do NOT buy this if you are buying it for a psp."
4,Sandisk Pro Duo Memory Stick,Standard product - seems to always work. Beats paying Sony an undeserved premium for their branded stick - works just as well.
5,Good money saver,Generally I am against any products imported from china but this is exactly half the price of the Sony 1GB Memory Stick Pro Duo (Made in Japan) I own multiple cards of both the Sony and this product. This card seems to operate at the same speed as the Sony version. It reads fast and holds your data with out fail for half the price. You can't beat SanDisk when it comes to these cards. I am very pleased.
3,doesn't fit my camera,"I didn't know what I needed for my older Kodak Easyshare camera. I thought this would fit by the site leading to this product, but it is too small for the slot in the camera."
3,incompatible with sony cybershot dsc-p20,"I've been unable to find regular original sony memory sticks for this camera, so I got an adapter and this 1G ms pro duo card, I get nothing but flash card errors with this camera. I connected the flash card and adapter to my computer and formatted it, and got the same result. Buyer beware."
5,Worked well for my PSP,"It's working very well for my PSP, good price, good product. I only wish the 8Gig version was cheaper."
3,"good, cheap memory",unfortunately this memory only writes at about half the speed of regular stock sony memsticks...which causes lag in my t30
1,This card has problems when used in PSP,"Originally, this card work fine and held numerous MP3 and video files for my PSP, playback was also fine. However, one day it simply failed when I turned on my PSP and all data was lost and the card cannot be read by my or any other PSP's, not an uncommon problem with this card I've since found out. As I'd had the card for over 30 days, Amazon cannot replace it as it's against their returns policy. Just a warning."
5,Memory card is just as good as Sony's Pro Duo,"I bought this memory card when I originally ordered my Sony Cybershot. Honestly, you couldn't ask for better performance. I've had zero problems (fast and reliable), and can't possibly see why anyone would want to throw away their money on the Sony's Pro Duo when you can buy the SanDisk generic version for $20 cheaper."
4,functions as intended,functions as intended. i use this in my old digital camera so that i can use the larger memory cards. i hope that there is no compatibility issues!
1,Don't waste your money!,"This author and his book on Saturn was cited in Arroyo so I figured that it/he was good. Not so! Do not waste your time and money on this book! It is just plain bad. Poorly laid out, says very little new about Saturn and its transits and well, enough. I left it at a lunch counter on purpose."
4,Have bag will travel,"This duffel is exactly what I needed and described exactly how it is; there were no surprises (pleasant or otherwise) when it arrived. It is roomy and has an exterior zippered pocket for instant access. There are plenty of straps and heavy-duty handles.There are no dividers inside this bag, so expect to find all your belongings in a large lump at the bottom. Not much different than most cases.The only downside to my bag is the tow handle slides out okay, but does not want to go back in, even with much wiggling and applying weight. Then, of course, it is in the way."
3,Overrated,"We ordered this because it seemed to be good quality and we have bought high sierra products in the past, so we just assumed this was as good as the others. Unfortunately, we were surprised when it arrived and had to ship it back a day or two later. It was just not the quality it seemed and not definitely the quality you can rely for several trips.I don't think i would recommend it to others unless they just wanted it for camping trips or something."
4,good for traveling,"The duffel bag is very spacious, you can fit tons of items in it, clothing, whatever you want. But it has a hard time standing up for some reason lol..I kept having to lean it against a wall. It has no inside pockets, if you're looking for many pockets, this isn't the bag for you. The wheels are very smooth, although the handle is a bit short. Fine for me because I am only 5'3""."
3,Not travel hardy,The bag is big and comfortable but I noticed signs of ware after the first trip and even a puncture. I have other duffel bags and they survived trips better than this one.
4,works as described,The cable and software work as they should.The software has an update feature which did not work.I contacted the mfg of the Motorola Phone Tools(Avanquest Software)for the update and you have to prove your purchase via sales receipt or scan of disk to receive an update link.Overall I'm satisfied.
1,It is what it is.,"They're batteries. What else is there to say? Buy 'em if you need 'em. If you don't need 'em, don't buy 'em. Your kids won't have much fun opening their gifts on Christmas morning and finding a pack of four AAA batteries to play with.Besides, don't you hate AAA batteries? Everything in the world uses AA batteries, except for those rare items you stumble upon that use AAA. Then you buy a pack, and are left with a whole bunch of extras that you can't use in anything else because NOTHING ELSE USES THEM.**This review is purely of a sarcastic nature. AAA batteries have their purpose and justification in life alongside every other type of battery.***snicker*"
5,Backstage Pass!,"Brian Shul does an excellent job of putting you in the cockpit of the Thunderbirds, both literally with the many great photos, but also from many of the pilot's own words while taking you through training season all the way to the elegant air show! Brian also has a book about the Blue Angels and one about the bird he flew himself, the SR-71 called ""Sled Driver"". Great writer, photographer and fighter pilot. This is a great book about the best aerial demo team in North America (runner-up: The Blue Angels)!"
3,I Couldn't Smoke The Grass On My Father's Lawn,"I Couldn't Smoke The Grass On My Father's LawnI was born in the same year as Michael Chaplin and I was living in the town of his birth, Santa Monica, California when I read his book when it was released in paperback. I don't think there had ever been a hardcover release.1966 was a tumultuous time when baby boomers were breaking away. I related completely with the alienation between a famous parent and an emerging adult in their shadow. I admit that it wasn't a great piece of writing but broke as he was in London this book was a personal catharsis that had to be written. If money had anything to do with it, it was to buy pot. All that being said this small volume depicts through the voice of his son and important side of Charley Chaplin. Paradoxically, it will add depth to his father who as I would learn later was one of the great geniuses of the 20th century. I have no doubt that he was hard on Michael but Michael survived."
5,If you need to be humbled....read this book,"I am reminded by people like George Carver and Booker Washington that I have done so little, while they accomplished so very much. Besides the awe inspiring historical accounts of these two saints, the book is written with a kind of zeal that is obvious to the reader. It is obvious that the author loved writing it as much as we enjoy reading it (either that or he fakes it really well).I have only a few books that I will make my children read (when they come of age)....this is one of them."
5,Excellent Book,"Elsie at Ion: book 19 of the original Elsie Dinsmore series is very good. This is one of my favorite Elsie books because it breaks up the long history lessons Capt. Raymond gives in books 16, parts of 17, and 18. Finally, we get caught up on all the family news: Elsie and Cousin Ronald discover another relation to them, Arthur and Cal find brides, and Arthur saves a family friend from drowning. These are just some of the many things that happen to the extended Dinsmore family.Acts of ventriloquism on several unsuspecting characters adds to the fun. Intertwined with it all are the truths of God's Word, played out in several different scenes.This book tops many in the series and rightly so! Its content is superb. I highly recommend it. You won't be disappointed. :-)"
1,Too Boring.,"Elsie and Cousin Ronald discover a long-lost cousin, Marian McAlpine, and Harold and Herbert Travilla graduate from Princeton and begin their mefical apprenticeships with Cousin Arthur. Edward, Zoe, and their twins narrowly escape being crushed by a falling tree and learn more about trusting in God's protective care. Lone-time bachelors Calhoun and Arthur Conly both find brides.After Max Raymond's visit home from the Naval Academy, the family enjoys another get together at the shore. And Cousin Arthur sames a family friend from drowning.That justs about sums up the whole book. I can read these books in 30 mn. flat because they are sooooo boring.Books 1-14 is ok, but after that it is entierly boring. They even have Cp. Raymond reading out of a history book!"
3,"Ours broke, but Mr. Coffee customer service excellent","We purchased this model from Target for home (once per day) use, and one day it broke (when you poured water into the back, it came right through the bottom of the machine and was leaking everywhere). We were outside of the 90 day warranty and Mr. Coffee still took care of us and sent a new coffee maker. We have not had any problems with the new one and find that it makes a good cup of coffee."
4,Best coffee maker I have ever had,"I was not sure about this because all the reviews stated it leaked terribly. I have not had that problem at all. I got mine very discounted because of a very minor scratch on the front. I have never tasted coffee this great in my home. I never had the water filtered before. The only problem I have had is the delay brew stopped working for some reason. Not a big problem for me, however. I have always been a big spiller when pouring my coffee. This is the only coffee maker I have had where I have not had this problem at all. I have been very happy with this purchase."
1,Stopped brewing correctly in 3 weeks,"Will NEVER buy another. This machine stopped brewing correctly after 3 weeks, it t0ok longer and longer to brew even after repeated cleaning."
4,Great coffee maker,"I have had the older version of this coffee maker for years, maybe 5 years and have had no problems with it until I dropped the filter holder and it broke. My fault, not the coffee makers fault. For the previous negative reviews: What coffee maker do you not have to place the decanter just right to get the coffee in it? Also, there is a temperature knob that will keep your coffee as hot or cool as you want it, just turn the knob to the highest setting. Also, how long does it take someone to pour a cup of coffee? The pause feature is for 30 seconds. I can pour three cups in that amount of time. Great machine at a great price. Going to buy another one since they don't sell the filter holder separately."
1,Lasted about a week past the warranty,Worked well for about three months and then started leaking out the bottom. Just after the 90 day warranty expired. Will never waste money on Mr. Coffe products again.
2,Dont buy this unit,"I love Mr Coffee machines, but this one does not meet my expectations and it won’t meet yours! If you own a dog, Fido won’t like the audible alarm when your coffee is ready or when your 2hrs is up. Its high pitch and unable to silence. Also I like to remove my coffee grounds right after it’s done brewing….on this unit the condensation and last few drops in the reservoir don’t drain into the carafe, rather onto the hot plate. Just a poor design over all!!!!"
1,Don't buy this unless you want to replace it!,"I purchased this model about two years ago. It worked fine for about 4 months and then one day I heard a ""popping"" noise on the kitchen counter. I didn't really pay it much attention and the next morning made coffee. Apparently the ""popping"" noise was the water reservoir bursting as when I poured in the water, it ran all over the counter.Mr. Coffee replaced it by sending me a new one at no charge. This morning, about a year later, I heard the same ""popping"" noise again. This time, I poured water in it after I put it in the sink. Once again, water ran everywhere out the bottom.I sent Mr. Coffee an e-mail complaining about this but have not yet heard back from them. Even if they offer to replace it, I won't accept it as it will apparently just do it again."
1,3 years going,"We purchased this particular pot because of the red color and I had 5 minutes to pick it out at Target. I do NOT recommend this coffee pot because it leaks, doesn't keep coffee warm, automatic start would not start and now it just stopped working. By far the worst one yet. The cheap $12 pot I had before this one last almost 10 years with daily use. I only kept this one because it worked when you push the on off button, it now is going to the garbage!"
1,Very disappointed,"Bought this in December 2009... today.. February 23, 2010 it finally died! Has not brewed properly since we bought it. Should have taken it back but didnt have the box.. who would have thought a coffee pot woudlnt last a week?? Most days it takes forever to brew... like an hour for 8 cups of coffee! Thank god most nites we could set it the nite before for an hour before we get up! This morning I poured the water in to make coffee.. and it came right back out of the bottom of the unit. I have unplugged it as I am afraid it will burn down my house! Mr Coffee is sending me a replacment...better unit he says...very expensive..that doesnt impress me... FTXSS43GTF.. but.. the reviews for it are not much better. Will try it as opposed to just being out the money because getting it back was not an option. Kudos to them for replacing the product.. but.. I would much rather see a good quality product produced!"
1,FTX43 Coffee Maker,"We bought this unit about two years ago. The coffee pot leaks around the upper rim, dripping both water when filling the coffee maker, and coffee when filling the cup. The coffee maker leaks a small amount of coffee from the base of the unit. This coffee maker is TOTALLY unsatisfactory."
4,gooood product,"I bought a mount ago. The same good as my old the same one.Arrived in few days. That I choose the same Mr.Coffee.Mr. Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker, Chrome"
2,Not very happy!,"The coffee pot looks great, but after a couple of months didn't make or keep the coffee temperature very hot. I've tried cleaning it, and turning the warming plate up to high, but it still puts out lukewarm coffee. I ignored the problem and now the coffee maker is past its warranty date. I will have to get a new coffee maker (not a Mr. Coffee!) because I finally decided that to get through a Colorado winter, I need piping hot coffee. I can't speak to the programmable features, because I never use them. I just like the red color!"
1,Mr Coffee is the worst. Cannot stand the test of a few months,"This is my first review. Ive had many problems and felt i should review this ripoff machine. I've had 2 machines, both broken in less than 6 months. I only use it once in the mornings, im not brewing coffee all day. If you dont want to deal with a broken machine every few months, especially when you want your coffee, look elsewhere!!! Made in China, should have expected. They want it to break so you will buy another."
2,Mr. Coffee,"The only reason I am giving this a 2 star rating rather than a 1 star rating is because it's a nice looking coffee maker. But what good is it when you can't use it? We bought this 6 months ago. The primary problem is that the water compartment is in the same area as the coffee cone. Therefore, the coffee splatters into the water compartment clogging it constantly then leaking onto the counter. I've spent lots of time cleaning it out with vinegar to unclog it. I hope Mr. Coffee engineers read this, so maybe they can correct the problem. The coffee tastes great when we have been able to make it work."
1,Buy something else!,"This is without a doubt the worst coffee maker I've ever owned! The water lines inside the unit pop off randomly and leaks water all over my kitchen. We've gotten to the point that we don't even put all the screws back in the bottom plate because we know we're going to have to get back in there and hook the lines back up every other week. The the cleaning cycle holds us hostage for days at a time, demanding that we clean it over and over and over which can take hours when all we want is a cup of coffee! This has gone on for more than 2 days in a row now. Do yourself a favor and buy something else!"
2,Broken in less than 2 months,We purchased this coffeemaker in February and April 1 it broke. I have written Mr. Coffee to find out how to get a replacement part. It's a small but essential component that shuts off the flow of water when the carafe is moved from the warming plate and reopens the flow when it is replaced. In addition the warmer stays on for a mere 60 minutes with no adjustment as to how long it should stay on. I suggest you avoid this product.
1,DO NOT BUY!,"I purchased this coffee maker for capacity and because it looks really nice. Has great features.It has some sort of Achilles heel in its design. I had one and then after 6 months the reservoir would no longer hold water. Called, complained, got a new unit. Due to a shipping error they sent me two new units. All three have done the same thing. We have kept our units on Max Temp for the carafe warmer. I believe this has to do with the resevoir malfunction but I didn't take it completely apart to determine for sure. Buying another brand/model altogether."
1,They don't make 'em like they used to.,"I purchased this product only 13 months ago, this morning it stopped brewing coffee. I am going back to the old coffee maker that has a simple on/off switch, like the kind I had for 15 years before purchasing this landfill decoration. On a positive note, the incredibly bright beacon is still shining on!"
4,MR Coffee FTX43-2 12 CUP COFFEE MAKER,"LOVE THE MACHINE, THE ONLY DRAWBACKS ARE THE 2HR SHUTOFF (A LITTLE SHORT, BUT TOLERABLE) AND THE BLACK UNIT WITH A STAINLESS FACE IS IMPOSSIBLE TO READ. THE BLACK BLENDS IN WITH THE STAINLESS, AND MAKES SO YOU HAVE TO TILT YOUR HEAD JUST RIGHT, OR MOVE THE MACHINE TO A DIFFERENT LIGHT THAT WILL HIGHLIGHT THE WRITING. BUT THE MACHINE IS A DREAM. MAKES GOOD COFFEE, HAS A DIFFUSER FILTER THAT LETS THE WATER SEEP THROUGH RATHER THAN ""SHOWER"" THROUGH AND MAKES A GOOD CUP OF COFFEE. I RECOMMEND PURCHASING ONE THAT IS READABLE."
1,Please do not buy,"I'm on my third coffee pot in one year of this model. The First two were exchanged. This one will be going into the trash. Received as a wedding gift. Returned the first on because it didn't keep coffee hot, the second one over heated and damaged the base of the pot. NOW THIS ONE, shuts off after making one cup and does not continue to make any more coffee. I have to shut it off and restart it 8 times before it will make 10 cups of coffee."
1,Poor Customer Service,"I ordered the FTX45 brewer but was sent the FTX45-1. This coffee pot lacks the warmer plate temperatue control. I contacted Mr Coffee customer service about the error in their manual stating the feature was present, Their standard answer is we will pass this information along, there is never an offer to replace or give something for the inconvience. I will never buy a Mr Coffee product again, it is worth the extra money to buy products from a company that understands customer service.One other point, their filtration system is very poor, I can't tell the difference with or without the little disk.Disapointed"
1,The FTX45-1 Coffeemaker lasted 5 months,"Bought this coffee maker in May of this year and as of yesterday it is toast. You pour water into the coffee maker and it comes out the bottom. I cannot believe this coffee maker only lasted this length of time. I used it once a day for approximately 5 months. I can say that I called the web site for Mr Coffee at 1-800-672-6333 and they are sending me a new coffee maker in 6-8 days. After reading the reviews, I wonder how long my second coffee maker will last. Good luck to anyone that buys this model."
1,Don't buy it,"We have had nothing but trouble with this pot since it entered our house 6 months ago. The water reservoir is located in the rear and there is a very small area to actually pour the water into, very bad design!The brew pot is constantly over flowing with grounds spilling down into the pot, and now the plastic piece that stops the coffee from flowing down while it's dripping has broken. I would not recommend this pot!"
1,A disappointment,"I bought one of these for my mom, and she liked it. I got one, too. But I have to say that I'm disappointed. It worked fine for a couple of months, then it started slowing down and it wouldn't complete the cycle. I have cleaned it with vinegar AND coffee maker cleaner. Still slow as molasses. I cannot recommend this coffee maker."
1,Goodbye Mr. Coffee,I was always loyal to Mr. Coffee but after three of these coffee makers it's time to move on. The first one I owned the warmer stopped working. So I bought another one without the adjustable warmer setting(I like the features). This unit leaked all over and about a year later just stopped working. The third unit lasted about 8 months steams a lot and now the lights flash. We have to slap it around a dozen times to get it to brew. I'm not the kind of person that follows through on warranties so I will be switching to another brand.I hear Bunn is pretty good.
1,Engineering design disaster,"This coffeemaker is terrible...extremely poorly engineered. I'm posting this review to warn others so they don't waste their money on it.The water hose inside my machine spontaneously disconnected; water ran all over the counter, of course. Took off the bottom, put the hose back together. It fell off again. Bought a small screw-down tubing clamp at the hardware store, fixed that for good. A month later, it just stops in the middle of the brewing cycle, and you have to take the pot out and put it back and jiggle it to start the brew cycle again. The little rubber ""feet"" on the bottom of the coffee maker fall out whenever it's moved.If you're tall like me, the LCD clock display is unreadable unless you crouch down and get on eye level with it.I tossed it in the trash. Save yourself that step, and just don't buy it."
1,FTX45-1 A PIECE OF JUNK,"MR COFFEE FTX45-1 IS A PIECE OF JUNK. I ACTUALLY DECIDED TO SPEND MORE MONEY FOR A MR COFFEE THINKING I WOULD GET A BETTER PRODUCT. THIS IS THE WORST COFFEEMAKER I HAVE EVER HAD! IF I DON'T HAVE THE POT SET ON THE BURNER EXACTLY RIGHT (I MEAN EXACTLY!!), THEN THE COFFEE DOESN'T FLOW DOWN, FILLS UP THE BASKET, AND LEAKS OUT THE BOTTOM ALL OVER THE COUNTER. THEN IF I FIX THE POT ALIGNMENT, THE COFFEE IS FULL OF GROUNDS. THE PAUSE FEATURE WORKS, EXCEPT THAT IT DOESN'T PAUSE LONG ENOUGH TO FILL UP YOUR CUP!! DO NOT BUY THIS COFFEEMAKER. Mr. Coffee 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker, FTX45-1"
1,Didn't Last Long,"I bought this cassette recorder for my mother who liked the big buttons. However, it only lasted about 3 months before the rewind button got stuck, and we were unable to get it to stop. It was great while it lasted, which wasn't long"
5,"A fun, informative read...","This is not a book teaching how to write a film score. Instead, it shows how film scores are conceived, created, and recorded, and is written for any enthusiast to enjoy. There are chapters covering who does what, how they do it, the machines involved, and case studies of several films with notable scores. In addition to explaining current practice, the book includes historical material about the legendary film music of the old-time studios and their staff composers and orchestras. The appendix section has guides to various composers listing their works, and a list of movies listing their composers. You can even look up Academy Award winners from each year! This is a fun book to sit and browse through."
5,Again and again...,"I wrote the above review over 3 years ago, and I think I've re-read this book as many times since then. I *still* can't get enough of it."
5,Funny and exciting,"I loved this book. The title alone got me quite intrigued. The cover both front and back is HOT! I love it. Being that I grew up in the Wash. Metropolitan area during that time period, I was truly able to relate. I was cracking up laughing the entire time I read it. It's surely a page turner and definitely erotic. I could not put it down. Its a quick read and funny. I'm looking forward to the sequel. I can't wait. Keep an open mind."
2,Nice,It is always nice to read about places in your home town. To hear positive stories about good times being had. They say when you find the one it will turn out to bite you. To be erotic I would like more detail the explanations were not always clear but I feel with time this writer will be one of our hottest.
5,"Great acoustic guitar music, it must be in the name","It is hard to find any information about this band because of its very common name. Based on the infomation I could find it appears to orginate from one of the Scandinavian countries (Norway?). Well doesn't matter where they come from, they sound great! This is probably one of those bands only known by a selective group of people, which is totally unfair. If this would receive the right marketing, it could be a million seller. What kind of music to expect? Well, the album consists of pure acoustic guitar, nylon and steel string, playing with great percussion. It has a bit of an eastern/Arabic atmosphere, but not too much, it reminds me a bit of Steve Stevens ""Flamenco a-go-go"". The sound quality is perfect, the compositions are very complex but surprisingly easy listening. Great work, band no-one has ever heard of ...! I'll be checking out your other albums ...."
5,My favorate CD at this time,"This is the best blend of acoustic guitar, Spanish guitar, and bongos like I never heard before. It should blow you away."
2,A small measure of a great comedian.,"Overall better than the first in the series, but falls far short of what I hoped to see. The video is in two sections. The first is from the old lunch series, and the second is from the evening series. The first is run of the mill. But hold on, the second is in color,with full editing. Although no where near his best, it will have to do. It is a shame his classic clips were not used. The younger people could have seen his great talent."
1,BAD!,The DVD was from the wrong region! So I couldn't watch the movie. I think the vendor should know where the product is going and if the product its going to be able to satisfy the necessities that the client is asking for.
2,At least Silverchair can play their instruments,"I bought this CD back in '95 after reading the Spin Magazine article about them, and boy, was I ever disappointed. This ""album"" (actually just a demo tape) was apparently recorded in Ben Lee's bedroom, and it shows -- I've heard karaoke tapes with far better sound qualities! As for the songs: they are somewhat amusing at first (especially ""I Wish I Was Him"", a tribute to Evan Dando of the Lemonheads), but they are nothing out of the ordinary, and Ben Lee and his friends can't sing or play their instruments. Oh yeah, I would stay away from Ben Lee's ""critically-acclaimed"" follow-up (""Grandpaw Would"") as well. I've only seen the video for ""Away With The Pixies"" once, but it didn't seem like Ben's guitar-playing/singing/song-writing had improved at all. I remember when there were heated discussions about Silverchair vs. Noise Addict/Ben Lee. My 2 cents: stay away from them both."
5,The Sound Remains The Same,Unbelievable note for note copy and production of the real deal. This guys are into the details which makes it sound like the original. Or is it maybe another take done in the studio by Led Zep?Is that a good thing? Well I'm not sure. But I'm giving this the highest rating because they pull it off so well. You will bet you are listening to the original!!!
4,"Garlic, Onion & Other Alliums",Interesting. I never knew there were so many varities of garlic and onions. I'll be growing some next year.
5,Ben Lee's Magical Gem,"This album is pure pop in it's most perfect form. If you liked the Beach Boy's ""Pet Sounds"", you'll appreciate the lo-fi experimentations of Mr. Lee. The sound is immediate and intimate, vulnerable and wounded like a scorned lover. This breezy casual record is perfect for a day in the sun. One of my all time favorites."
1,Short and sweet,I was first introduced to Ben Lee from a Doc. Martin promo cd. I was really excited about acquiring more music by this artist. I chose this cd by Ben Lee first because of all the great reviews it got on this web site. Bad choice!!! I can't even get through the cd. It sounds like it was recorded in a garage and his voice is about as pleasing as finger nails on a chalkboard. What a waste of money. I plan on keeping this cd around in case I have some guests over that I want to leave but won't. I will just put this cd in the player and crank it up. Guests will leave from the irrating sound coming out of my speakers.
2,Could've saved money buying all cardboard,It would have been more cost effective to purchase the all cardboard one sold at Staples.
3,Functional,"The mail organizer is functional but not the most sturdy. For the price though, it serves the purpose."
4,"Was disappointed about cardboard shelving, but ...","I've had this product since 2005. Like other reviewers have mentioned, I was disappointed when I received this and realized that the shelving and back cover are made of cardboard. I was afraid that the thin fastener nails wouldn't keep things together. That said, I've had the unit for over six years and I've moved over five times (college student) and it hasn't received any functional defects. Cosmetic, yes; a little scuffing. The melamine holds up. Pricey, though. Thinking of getting thisFellowes Bankers Box 21-Compartment Literature Sorter, Letter (04210)in the near future. I have so much [expletive omitted] paper!"
4,NOT all wood,"I got theFellowes 25400 12-Section Compartment Sorter, Melamine Laminated, Medium Oak(LOL, Medium Oak not full oak.) I was thinking it was all wood. its not the shelves are cardboard. however it is a Vary nice cardboard and was vary strong with the plastic supports on front of the horizontal card board shelves. the Assembly was some what ez for me, but i am good at that. all in all its strong after assembly and looks good once you get past the Vary nice looking cardboard. the price is also the lowest you can get and not get something that is made of all cardboard."
1,would not buy this item again,"I would not buy this item again, there is no screws to hold the shelf together only pegs that you have to glue in and it was the worse thing ever that I had to put together..not happy with it at all.."
3,Meets our Needs,"When this item arrived at our offices via USPS, the box was damaged. It appeared to have been shipped more than once. The damage inside the box was even worse. The vendor was accommodating and advised that we would be refunded upon return of the item and advised that the organizer was no longer available.We ended up buying this item from Staples. It was received in good condition and works fine as a mail sorter for our administrative staff. In the future, if another one is needed, I'll order one from Staples."
2,DMSO not for everyone,"When I received the item the lid was cracked so it leaked all over and I was actually disappointed in the product. I purchased this because of the reviews I read that stated DMSO was very good for arthritis and I have been using it now for over a month and the product has not subsited the pain. I am using it on other things which it does very well, but everyone is different and what works for one person may not work for another.I just was very disappointed that the bottle lid was cracked and a lot of the solution leaked out!"
4,OK,Received the DMSO promptly. I do feel some pain relief when I use it. I must admit that I live with chronic pain.Nothing helps very much.
3,Had to return the seat covers,I bought this because it's a reasonable price for neoprene seat covers. When they came in I really liked their feel and they were easy to install. But I discovered I only got the 2 seat covers and the console cover was missing. I contacted Amazon who promptly shipped me out a new set. I opened the box and again the console cover is missing.I've sent back both sets to Amazon for a refund and I'll be buying them from Coverking directly.
2,I was hopeful...,"I saw this on a video of a girl with curly hair (like myself) and she was raving about it. I decided to give it a try, despite the price tag. Well, the one plus is that it smells great, which makes me wish I loved it. But honestly it made my hair so greasy it looked like I hadn't washed it in days. (I have normal hair, was looking for a little extra moisture and shine) Maybe this product would work better on someone with MUCH drier hair? I tried it several times, on wet, damp, and dry hair. Each way I used it, I got the same result. I really wanted to love this product, but sadly, it is just sitting in my bathroom unused. I am still searching for the perfect product..."
4,"Easier to comb, too",Along with the conditioning benefits I like that my hair is easier to comb. I am unhappy that the price has risen regularly over the past year. I think they're pushing it a bit.
1,Not so great,I bought this because my haircutter at the salon recommended it to me. Sad to say I was disappointed; it did nothing at all.
4,Wonderful & Informative video,This was a wonderful program. The video follows a lemur family/pack thoughout its travels. It shows real antics of ring tails and was very informative. Although there are a few pats I wish it had not included-it was very real to actual life. I would recommend anyone watch/buy this video. (especially if your interest is in lemurs!)
3,Just OK,"Usually you can figure total satisfaction with Hanes sizing. Their one size fit all socks just don't really work that well. If it just pulled these ""Extra Low Cut"" ""No Show"" socks on, they'd be around my ankles. If I play with them enough I can get them to pass for low cut. I wear a 9.5 shoe and as nearly as I can figure, that's right in the middle of ""normal"". I'd figure that these extra low cut socks would fit nearly perfect but they're no even close. They are well made and really comfortable, but greatly oversized. They would be about the perfect size if I wore an 11.5, or wore them over my 9.5 shoes."
3,good book but needs more maps and less words,"I am pasting this in all 4 volumes of the series. I read all when I had a broken leg this winter.A little academic. Worth reading for the knowledge of our country. But, part of the interest in Geography is in seeing the physical ramifications of what is being talked about... more maps, please.But I didn't rank it high because I felt sometimes as if I was rereading a passage I had just read a couple of pages back. I guess it was written in that old fashioned style of ""tell-tell-tell"" approach. [""Tell them what you're going to say. Say it. Then remind them what you said. ] BORING.. who has time to read things 3 times these days !?!?!? Maybe a little editing could get the page count from 600 down to 300 and add more maps?!?I would have given it a higher rank if it gave a summary overview and then wrote the account and ended with a summary - BUT THEY NEED TO BE DIFFERENT WORDS, SENTENCES, and IDEAS..... NOT THE EXACT SAME SENTENCES."
5,MUSIC FROM THE SOUL,"RHONDA LARSON gives us a glimpse of her soul in the deeply evocative streams from her flutes, and from the sounds of her worldly and exceedingly talented ensemble.Her newest release, DISTANT MIRRORS is a profound reflection on moments, both past and future."
5,Very effective...too effective?,"We have a LOT of particulates in our water and this flter does a fantastic job. Unfortunately performance drops quickly, reducing flow to an annoyingly slow drizzle. If you have a lot of particles and are not concerned with cysts etc, you may want to downgrade to the 8171413 which is also effective with chlorine and lead reduction but seems to last far longer before flow is restricted."
4,Good CD,Arrived quickly.Well written on a topic that everyone should learn more about.We showed it to 2 groups of friends already.
3,Colorado from the top to the bottom...as low as you can go,"The disastrous results of big oil and gas invading Colorado in the 90's are documented here. The industry had every right to do what they did, and now everyone is surprised that public safety and cleaner ways of doing things got in the way of profits. Lets all vote to build a pipeline from Canada to the Gulf Coast next; it creates jobs and only later will probably screw up a few lives and environments. Surely we can count on these large corporations to be fair, honest and careful the next time."
1,The Cover was the only thing of any worth,"I recently purchased this GL graphic novel to add to my collection and was deeply disappointed with the stories. I found the writing style to be somewhat childish (aimed towards a teenage/pre-teen demographic).The concept of continuity through the intro. of a new villian in GL's rogue's gallery was good. Unfortunately, I wasted my money on this drivel. The only thing of note besides the artwork was the attractive book cover."
5,Excellent read,"After reading Justin Spring's biography of Samuel Steward (aka Phil Andros), viz., ""The Secret Historian"", I was intrigued enough to want to know how good a writer of erotic fiction Samuel Steward was. I found ""Greek Ways"" to be enjoyable, though not very titillating after the first few chapters because the fascination with eroticism can only last so long. However, Steward has an interesting prose style which keeps the reader engaged."
5,Awesome book,"This book is a great. It covers information that you might not find in other books, copyright info., characters and scripts, duo tone. The drawings are beautiful, especially the animal and human drawings. The perspective section was helpful as I have dreaded and feared learning perspective. He shows you concisely how to do it. I followed along and was able to do it! The overlapping concept on pg. 37 is just great, it truly helped my drawing. The sequential art section is good for storytelling, and the inking page shows you the direction or how to move your brush or get the brush stroke you want.This book is great for beginners and professionals. It is easy to read and the drawings are just great.The book is a limited edition, and my copy came signed. Hey, this book has quotes in the back cover from Dr. Seuss and Frank Frazetta."
1,low budget mess,"THIS MOVIE WAS DEFINATELY A WASTE OF MONEY,IT IS A LOW BUDGET SENCELESS MESS SEEMS LIKE SOMEONE HAD A FEW DOLLARS TO BLOW AND DECIDED TO MAKE THIS MESS TWO DEAD KIDS RUNNING AROUND IN THE FOREST TRYING TO KEEP THEIR DAD FROM KILLING PEOPLE IT SOUNDED GOOD WHEN I READ THE SYPNOSIS BUT THAT,S JUST WHAT I DID SOUNDED GOOD ,DON,T WASTE A PENNY ON THIS ONE TRUST ME!"
1,"A boring slasher, stay out of the Forest!","Just another boring slasher film about a crazy man who looks eerily like George Lucas stalking people in a Cali forest. Music is beyond bad and the script paired with the acting is just awful, boring and been done better in countless other films. Veer away unless you are a VERY hard core slasher junkie."
4,Breakthrough music,Another great record from the Beastie Boys. They keep honing their skills and building to their strengths in this album.
2,What an awful pick for #1,"Any true Beasties fan will tell you that Paul's Boutique is their best album. Check Your Head is better if you want to hear the Beasties' musicianship. This album is a weak watered-down version of the former Beasties. Don't believe the hype. How anyone could pick this as the best album of the nineties is beyond me. I wouldn't even put it in my top 25, and I love the B-Boys!"
5,Best Beastie CD ever! Not a single bad song.,"Most CD's have a few good songs in addition to a bunch of garbage. This is the only exeption I have ever found. Just pop in the CD and listen; every track is excellent! You'd think it was a best hits album (which the Beasties should make, by the way). Five stars."
4,maybe you should check another one,"If you're being introduced to the BBoys, maybe you should try another one: Check Your Head. Although this one(Ill Comunication) is a hell of an album, I really think ""Check Your Head"" is lot more funkier. In case you don't know, buy both of them."
3,"Feeling ""Ill"".","This is easily one of their more popular albums, but probably the one I listen to the least. It doesn't flow well to my ears, and just never hooked me. Front to back ""Check Your Head"" is way better, and even ""Hello Nasty"" I like more. This does of course have the huge hit ""Sabotage"", but some of the rest is filler, and even ""Sure Shot"" and ""Root Down"" I never like that much. Even the cover is kind of lame. Still, there's a few gems. I'd get any other Beastie Boys album first, and if you're just looking for ""Sabotage"", ""Root Down"", and ""Sure Shot"", those are on the upcoming ""Solid Gold Hits"" collection."
5,best album in the history of music,"I have everything ever put out by the beastie boys, and this album is their best. It is also pure genius, no other album in the history of music brings so many styles together. This album would have still been the best ever even if it only has half the tracks it does. If the beastie boys had quit after this album and not made hello nasty they would have never put out a bad track."
4,Hootin' Hollerin' and Spittin' Rhythms,"The Beastie Boys blend the aural incongruencies of Moms Mabley, Richard Pryor, drum 'n' bass, police siren atmospherics and jazz records too obscure to mention into a riotus world-music urban rap."
4,THIS CD IS GOOD REAL GOOD!!!!,This cd is one of the best they have put out I prefer PAUL'S BOUTIQUE they are my number one band over any band thats been around they have come a long way since paully wogstew.thats B-BOYS
3,Moving in several directions at once,"This one can't really seem to decide if it wants to be 70s pimp movie music (most of the instrumentals), hardcore (""Tough Guy"",""Heart Attack Man""), old school party rap (""B-boys makin' with the Freak Freak"") or some sort of groundbreaking conscious rap (""Bodhisattva Vow"",""""The Update"").Best tracks here are mostly the singles: ""Sure Shot"", ""Root Down"". and ""Sabotage"". Of the instrumentals, ""Eugene's Lament"", a highly dissonant trainwreck with atonal violin screeching, is the most interesting although not necessarily one I'd like to hear often. ""Transitions"" is the most listenable sounding like some lost score track to a blaxploitation flick.Worst here are usually the instrumentals..most simply aren't that interesting, as well as the preachy tree hugger/one world rant ""The Update""."
3,"It's okay, but i wouldn't buy it","It has some good points, but other than that i wouldn't buy it, nor recomened it to anyone."
5,"Lyrics From The Song ""Root Down""",How Are You Gonna Kick It? Gonna Kick My Root Down. That Is How The Song Goes From Track #5
4,Hmmm...The B-Boys 2 Best Songs on One Album????,"Any album with ""Sure Shot"" and ""Sabotage"" is worth buying; however, reinforce it with such tracks as ""Root Down"" ""Flute Loop"" ""Let's Do It"" and ""Get it Together"" it's more than you could ask for. I wouldn't hesitate to buy this album, but what were the Boys thinking when they wrote ""Sabrosa"" and ""Tough Guy?"""
4,Cute little story!,"This was a cute story. It was kinda childish to me. I would have liked a more adult version of the story. I felt that it was written more for the teenage crowd than the adult. With that said, it was an ok read for me. Alicia got on my nerves!....Always eavesdropping and jumping to conclusions. She was a stubborn brat! I liked Flex and Sweet Dee's story in Sweet Sensation better. I did like the way the story ended. This was my second book by Gwyneth Bolton. I have ordered about 4 more and I hope they are geared towards an adult audience."
3,Too Juvenile,"The book was well written, however, I would have prefered to have more a mature (30 years and older) couple. Reading about 20-25 years old having relationship issues is not my preference."
1,Buy it individually!!,"First off, I have to say that I love this show. So why the 1 star rating? Because this set is not worth it!! I just bought these items individually at about $12 each!!. These 4 seasons come out to about $17 each. I'm trying to save some people money!"
4,Thoughtful balance of theory and suggestion,"This book is not a guide on how to implement multi-media learning in the classroom, but instead an investigation of different cognitive theories. Mayer does not see multi-media models as infallible and provides ideas on how and why they need to be improved. The more theoretical aspects are clearly explained and the book is very engaging. Highly recommended for anyone who is designing or implementing multi-media tools."
4,works as described,"Good product, very good price. A little difficult to set up initially, but looks great and works well. Holds the TV very securely"
3,"very sturdy, functional, limited adjustment","This was the cheapest monitor mount I could find, but it works just great for me. I use it for a 22 inch wide-screen computer monitor. It is very, very sturdy. The house would fall before the monitor does. It is easy to install and use, if you do not plan on making changes very often. I had to take the monitor off to adjust it. It has only 2 positions, flat and very near flat. Probably only about 3-5% from flat is the only other position.There's probably less than $1 worth of material in these, and it would be very simple to make, so when they become popular, expect a third world version for under $5. Till then, this is about as good a buy as I could find."
5,Great mount for the price.,You cant go wrong with this for $25. It is well made and very easy to hang.
5,Small & Sturdy LCD TV Mount,"This mount is just what I was looking for when mounting a 15"" LCD TV in our RV. The TV can easily be taken down when traveling if need, but is sturdy enough to leave the TV in place during transit. The Tilting range worked out well for a very small room, but can also be adjusted for a larger space."
1,overwritten mess,"starts out as though it's gonna tell a story, then the plot is just abandoned -- forget it, it's never resolved -- and part two is supposedly the author musing about ""what would i write if i was gonna write about this stuff?"" -- and then part three has nothing to do with anything. well, as my mama used to say, ""there's a whole lotta writing goin' on... and not much reading."" in other words mr wideman just performed this for himself, for his own private pleasure and none of ours."
5,Fast AND Good!!!,"What a totally great item!!! Now I can get brewed cold iced tea in just a few short minutes. Sure, you can get iced tea using instant tea mixes, but they just don't taste as good as brewed iced tea. But when you brew tea to make iced tea it takes a ton of ice to cool it down quickly, which totally waters down the tea.Not any more!!! Now with these cold brew tea bags it is a snap to make iced tea. The Lemon flavored tea is the best tasting to us since we prefer regular tea over fruit flavored teas, and we always add lemon. So this lemon flavor is just like the taste of the standard iced tea we used to make.The way I make this tea is use cold tap water, brew the tea for 10 minutes, then pour over ice. I use the recommended 4 bags per quart."
3,An Effortless Pitcher of Tea,"Cold brew tea bags will never be as flavorful as fresh brewed tea, but this one will suffice. It isn't very strong, and you may have to add extra lemon slices, lemon juice, or teabags to get a more potent, tasty flavor. Fresh, strong iced tea flavor is what's sacrificed for convenience and speed. For busy, or just plain tired people, it is a worthwhile trade-off.Compared to Lipton Cool Brew, these are a bit more crisp & flavorful. The downside, however, is you need at least 4-5 of teabags to get any flavor at all.I'd recommend splitting the cost of these teabags with a friend or family member the first time you purchase. Six boxes is a lot to have if you end up disliking them and you'll only be out half as much money!At the current price of $17.29 for six 48-ct boxes, I won't purchase this tea again. While I hate waiting for my tea to cool, or watering it down with ice & cool water, I prefer the potency and depth of flavor that it gives."
4,"Product Great, Shipping is EXPENSIVE!","I buy this because I can't find the bags anywhere else except here. The bag price is fine, only about 5 bucks. But they kill you on the shipping. I know for a fact that an envelope and cost of shipping for this item should be about 3 bucks at most. This company charged over 9 bucks. What a rip off."
5,I'm in serious love,"This bracelet is absolutely stunnig in it's simplicity. I love the scrollwork designs on the toggle clasp and i say I am in love with this bracelet because since i recieved it, 4 days after ordering it, I have not taken it off and I am searching for more blue topaz and silver jewelry."
1,Office 2000 Premium edition,"This is what I ordered, but this is not what I got. I got the upgrade only. It does not have these programson it at all. I paid $74.00 for something I all ready have. I was very very dissapointed when I finally got my tower back, I tried to install what I thought was the Office 2000 premium just to be let down. What a waste of money, which I can not afford to loose. So I will just have to consider this a very expensive lesson and not buy an more computer software. Just stick to buying movies. I have had very few bad experiences there. They are not costly either.Sandra Wardslwsundance1@qwestoffice"
1,Poor Choice,"This item is cheap, but still not worth the price. The set screws are so small that they stripped out the first time I used one of the extensions. I was able to install the drill bit but after I finished the job, I tried to remove the bit and stripped the set screws. Now, in order to save the bit I have to drill out the set screws. If you need a drill bit extension, buy one with larger set screws. If Amazon had labeled this as made in China, I might not have bought it in the first place."
4,"""AN INTERESTING READ""","An interesting book which transports you to the ancient indian culture and history. Full of intrigue,sex,voilence this book delivers a punch and more.....An epic story which really gives the reader an idea of what India was really like.A book which i got from a vendor, and which i read on pure instinct. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to all book lovers who dont mind knowing a bit of indian history,culture and rich heritage.A page turner no doubt!!!"
4,Works fine,"Calculator works fine. One has to think about the order of clicking, otherwise it does a nice job. Reliable, too."
2,metric converter calculator,This calculator is a really nice size but that is about all. The calculator came with minimal directions that no one could figure out how to use it. Might be really good if it had a lot more directions. Would not recommend this to anyone.
1,NOT WORTH IT,OK FIRST OFF THESE DONT COME COMPLETED SO YES YOU HAVE TO CRAMP EVERYTHING WITH IT PLUS MEASURE THE LENGTH OF THE OLD WIRES TO GET THE RIGHT SIZE. I JUST DIDNT WANT TO SCREW ANYTHING UP SO I JUST THEM BACK. NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE. WISH MSD WOULD ACTUALLY FINISH WHAT THEY STARTED.
4,A hilarious standout comedy.,"For some reason the comedy from the 80's stands out as it own genre, an this film cerainly fits there. Right along with shows like Big, and Soggy Bottom Usa. If you get you'll pop some stiches."
5,Rated R...for riot lol,I was unable to watch it because my tape player decided it didn't want to work. lol Condition of tape...case....tape is acceptable. This movie I recommend will make yore belly ache from laughing so hard.
4,Playboy Playmate Karen Witter is saving grace...,"This is a throwaway comedy, but it does feature arguably the hottest Playboy Playmate of the 80's, Karen Witter. In this film, she enjoys hiking up her skirt to show off her legs to any passing paramedic van. Yup, this girl's got it bad for paramedic guys and she loves standing out on the side of the road waiting to get picked up. And she does. She's a nymphomaniac with a strange fixation for the guys - or maybe even girls too? - in uniform.Apparently, she's got it so bad she doesn't discriminate and will take on white, black, old and young and plays the part with a lot of gusto. She even gives an elderly fella a heart attack after apparently riding him on his bed (we don't get to see this, sadly).Anyway, there is actually a story - not involving a Playmate - but you will soon forget it. The film is mostly hi-jinx and a couple of young upstarts sticking it to 'the man.' but trust me, you'll only remember Karen's gorgeous face and those stunning legs!"
5,Paramedics Movie,"This is about two Paramedics who are not your usual First Aid responders, This comedy shows the lighter side of paramedics and the way they feeel a ambulance should be equipped, Also what happens when thier peers don not agree with their way of doing things. There is a situation in which they are assigned to area where there are street battles and a funny way the respond to it."
4,Comfortable,"The shoe is very comfortable along the insole with lots of cushioning - you can walk for hours without your feet feeling the stress. However, there seems to be some inflexibility across the top of the shoe that can make pushing off when climbing inclines a slightly uncomfortable process. I haven't owned the shoes very long so this may be a result of having to break them in. I do appreciate the covered toe which I feel is a very big bonus for this shoe - it's not obtrusive and doesn't ruin the look of the shoe at all, but definitely helps during the aforementioned pushing off during inclines in that the front of the shoe stays relatively undamaged. The ankle support is good and hits right at the ankle bone so flexibility isn't impeded. I live in a wet climate and have never had any issues with leaking, so the waterproof claim is reliable. Overall, for the price I'm very happy with the shoe and consider it a solid purchase."

5,A cute little Bear,"It is a birthday present for my great grand daughter and I have no ideahow much she will learn from it,she will be only two years old.It is very cute and the DVD that comes with it is the educational toolthat she can play,while playing with the little Bear."
2,No Longer Interested in Carebears,"I think the older version is much better, and it will be worth money in the future than this version. Once again an older toy changed when it doesn't need to be. Not trying to get people going on here but in my opinion this version is ugly. My daughter enjoys the older version toys, and once the new ones came out she was no longer interested. We kept the playsets that came out in 2003 because she liked them so much, and she still plays with them at ten years old. So I decided to give this version a general rating of what I think about it, but I'm sure that in the end a durable toy is better than one that breaks easily."
5,black book,"I actually bought this as a gift for my husband who is a marvelous cook. We both sat down and looked it over and decided that it is a wonderful little tool that gives many different types of recipes that he'll be trying. We especially like the sprial bound and elastic strap, as those are 2 things that attracted me to buying the book. Most of the recipes are simple and easy, which is what we like when we BBQ."
1,The whole book,This is a small book. It will make a nice gift for someone with a casual interest in barbecue. It covers the basics with a few recipes to impress ones guests. However it will surely be a disappointment to a serious chef.
2,Just another overpriced text book,"Another class, another $150 book. What I don't like: The price is too high, the font is kind of small, and the hard back makes the book super heavy. The CD that is included has flash cards and practice tests, but not much else. I wish text book publishers would publish ebooks!What I did like: The book is very well written. I find it easy to read and understand."
4,great buy,the book arrived in a very timely fashion actually before i had expected it and it was in great condition no tears and no highlighting already in it for a used book.
5,Thank You Ms Stokes!!,"I have been playing around with my computer for a while, not really not knowing too much. Just playing games!! Now I can surf with the best of them! I now can keep up with my Grandchildren, who always knew more than me! I have bought many computer books that couldn't understand. I was even more comfused after trying to read them. They just sat on a shelf. NOW THIS IS A BOOK I UNDERSTAND!! Again thank you Ms Stokes !"
1,Not Worth The Postage,"There's a reason this item is so frequently marked down from it's $50-plus ""list"" price to less than $20 -- it is a useless piece of junk. I ordered this to dock my iPod with my beautiful new home stereo system so I could enjoy features like charge-while-in-use and remote control. Well, forget it. Just get an earphone-to-twin RCA cable, plug your iPod in, and charge as necessary. Charging via this device induces a mind-numbing buzz in the sound system, the earphone-jack connector is flimsy and requires constant jiggling . . . it was so bad I never even got around to trying the remote control. INSTEN = Instant Aggravation.Insten - Cradle v3.0 w/ Remote and Dock Plates for Apple iPod - Black"
3,Is NOT working,"I had written a review when I got this item. Very annoyingly when I actually tried using it to charge, etc. it did NOT WORK!! I don't know if this whole product is faulty but I DO NOT recommend this product. Disregard the 3 stars I rate this one or zero!**DO NOT BUY!"
2,Too big for not having a Menu button,"Has no function to go back to a previous menu. It does deliver video output, but Insten forgot more important and obvious details on this product."
1,Absolute Junk!,Worked for about an hour then died. Very low quality product. Save yourself the money and frustration and pass on this piece of junk.
1,Stopped working after one use!,"I bought this dock only because Apple still refuses to sell an official ipod dock in black. It was a terrible mistake, as it stopped working after one use. It not only stopped charging my ipod when it was plugged in, but actually drained the battery. And it no longer synchs. This dock could not be worse in every respect except for the color."
3,"Nice dock, remote died quickly","I've had this for about a month. It works just fine as a docking station, and is a lot cheaper than other options out there. However, in less than a month, my remote has stopped working. I will try getting new batteries for it and see if that fixes the problem, but a month seems pretty short for battery life. Because I purchased this with the remote as a ""bonus"" feature, I still consider the purchase not a total loss, and will continue to use it."
1,DO NOT BUY,"buyer bewarei bought a similar looking dock from a grocery store for 20 bucks.this price is so inflated and i can't imagine whydont be stupid, buy a different dock."
1,"Great idea, horrible execution","If you are interested in seeing Wordsworth's Gardens for ideas and inspiration, you had better look elsewhere. The photography in this book is outlandishly horrible. Over half of the full-page photographs are out of focus. Some photos are sickly blue, making the legendary daffodils look sad. The idea of this book is wonderful and the plans the author includes are very worthwhile, but it begs for a photographer."
2,breakable,"I got these magnets for my white board. They have good pull force, but that's about the only outstanding thing they have to offer. About four days after they arrived, they were accidentally dropped on the tile. They only fell about three and a half feet, and they broke! I started with six magnets, now I'm down to two. I know they are ceramic, but I figured they would live through a 4 ft. fall!"
4,Very pretty,"I am very happy with this toaster. It looks like real copper, unlike others that look like a thin sheet of copper colored plastic has been taped onto it. It works really well with toasting everything, but a simple piece of toast. I have not figured out how to select toasting darkness for a piece of bread. It can overtoast a slice. It does work really well with bagels, waffles, etc, as there is a setting specifically for these."
3,TOO SMALL,"5 STARS FOR STYLE, BEING VERY WELL MADE, AND SHEER BEAUTY. 0 STARS FOR SIZE. IF THE SLOTS HAD BEEN 1 TINY INCH LONGER AND 1/4 INCH DEEPER I WOULD HAVE KEPT IT. RYE BREAD IS TO LONG AS ARE THE NEWER WIDER AND ANY OTHER ROUND LOAF BREADS. THIS LOOKS LIKE IT WILL DO BAGELS AND ENGLISH MUFFINS NICELY BUT UNLESS YOU TOAST ONLY THE STANDARD SQUARE BREADS THIS WILL NOT WORK. WHY AREN'T SLOT LENGTH, DEPTH, AND WIDTH REQUIRED ON THE ""CUSTOMER INFO"" FOR TOASTERS?? WOULD HAVE BEEN HELPFUL, AND SAVED ME RETURN POSTAGE."
4,"Looks Great, Works Fine","I was hesitant to buy this; a cheaper model does basically the same thing. However, this looks great. It's sturdy and has multiple settings (most of which I have not used). I recommend it. It's snazzy looking, easy to use, and works great."
2,"Great book, poor translation.","While I agree with all the positive reviews concerning the Tirant, I also have to say that Rosenthal took liberties with this book that render this book an adaptation. Having read the Valencian and a Castilian version, I am convinced that the book lost so much in Rosenthal's translation. And, contrary to what Rosenthal claims, the first translation of this book was Ray La Fontaine, whose dissertation was indeed the first translation of this text. La Fontaine's text reads like the real text; and, in doing so, provides every morsel of detail that renders the work more authentically. And, if you read La Fontaine's version, you will find an abundance of interesting details that Rosenthal omitted."
5,"my perfect color! Unable to find in stores, very glad have found this lipstick.","I love this color and have been unable to find it in stores for quite some time. I recommend it to everyone. I will continue to buy it, and save it for a winter day, as long as i can."
5,One of our favorite science books,"My almost-5 year old has really developed a taste for science, and I credit this book. This is one of the first non-fiction book that I've read to him, and he loves it. (Also a huge fan of ""Are you a Ladybug?"") He's since expanded into Magic School Bus, and pretty much anything else he can get his hands on to learn about the world around him. There are lots of colorful pictures, and I've learned a lot myself reading this. Very worthwhile."
5,Fitted Mattress Pad Holds Up,The mattress pad fits the Pack N' Play Playard we ordered and has held up to many washings. I like the thickness of the plastic liner.
2,That smell!,"Okay. I should have read the description more closely and examined the materials listed. That's on me. But when I took this out of the package, I couldn't believe the vinyl smell. I threw it in the wash with some other laundry and everything in there came out smelling like vinyl. I took the pad out and washed that laundry again, twice, and there was still a faint smell on the clothes but they aired out okay. I washed the pad by itself once more but it still reeked, so I ended up ripping off the vinyl, which came off pretty easily. I washed it again, twice, and aired it out for a day or two. I have since washed it three more times and the smell is pretty much gone. It's an okay pad that you can get to fit the Graco P&P; if you really try, but it doesn't exactly fit like a glove. I would skip this one and just get a good-quality thick pad rather than waterproof.I really like the ABC/TL Care line of products and am pretty surprised that they came out with something like this."
2,Very poor fit; too small,I ordered this pad to use with my Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Reversible Napper and Changer. However the pad really too small for use with this playard. I can't recommend it.
1,Mattress pad,"This mattress pad, while indicating it fit the pack n play, does not. It is too small. I'm not sure what it does fit, but it doesn't fit the pack n play."
3,Heat sensitive,"Just got this item washed last night and the vinyl backing has puckered up and ripped open in a few small spots. As the package says it was washed in cold and was hung up to dry before fluffing in the dryer on low with a load of other blankets. Luckily the vinyl is thin and the puckering can't be felt through the quilting once it is on the mattress, but the small tears make it so it will not be waterproof."
3,"Good enough, not quite what I had hoped","I purchased this for my pack and play to try to make it a little more comfortable for my daughter. It fit nicely, but wasn't as ""cushy"" as I had hoped based on the other reviews. It was better than nothing, but I really wanted something with some padding."
4,Pretty Good,"I bought this because I read several reviews that it fits the DaVinci 5"" Mini Crib mattress. It does fit, although I wish it would wrap underneath a bit further. But it's difficult to find bedding for the mini cribs, and this does the job. I bought the Gerber knit crib sheet from Babies R' Us and it fits over the mattress and mattress pad nicely. It wraps further under the mattress than the pad, helping to ensure that it stays on. It's more plush than I expected or desired. I washed it and hung it to dry before using it, so I'm not sure how it holds up in the dryer. But it seems that it would hold up well over time with proper care. I'd recommend this product."
1,No Good!,After the second wash the plastic has melted and torn. I followed the directions and my dryer has a sensor on it so that it does not heat things. Still it is a mess. Going to return amd look for a new one.
5,Waterproof Fitted Quilted Port-crib Mattress Pad Cover,Works and fits perfect on the protable mattress I purchased. Washes and dries well. No noticeable shrinkage. Highly recommend.
1,mattress pad,"Did not fit the pack n play for which it came up with, to purchase to go with the pack n play. There was no dimensions to go by in the info for the pad."
4,fits our LA Baby mattress well,"We put an LA Baby mattress in our pack n play since that is where our son slept while in our room. This mattress pad fits that mattress well. It does make him a little warm with the vinyl backing, but the waterproof aspect works well!"
3,Too small for Graco Pack n' Play,"I liked the idea of putting on a waterproof cover for our Pack n' Play bassinet, but this cover is a tad too small. We tried stretching it a bit and then putting it back on, but it would create these large air bubbles that I didn't feel comfortable putting our newborn on top."
2,Not great for Chicco pack n play,"The liner is decent, however the fit for a chicco pack n play is not great. It bunches and I found it too thick to use."
3,"Nice product, but doesn't fit","I was happy with the item when I first received it, and I thought it fit the pack'n play. But when I washed it and tried to put it on the pack'n play it didn't fit. We have a Graco pack'n play. I ended up not using it at all, due to it bunching up too much to use, and then bought one that fit at Babies R Us."
4,Crib protector,I was very happy to find this crib protector as I was unable to find it in stores or other websites.
2,Too small for pack n' play,Bought this for a Pack n' play based on positive reviews -- should have trusted the reviewer who said it wouldn't fit the pack n' play because it doesn't! Seems like a good quality item if it fits your mattress.-- be sure to measure!
1,Bad Quality,This mattress is not worth the amount I paid for it. Made using cheap materials. I advise potential buyers to look elsewhere.
1,Terrible,"This completely fell apart the first time I washed it, hasn't even been used yet and it is destined for the trash!"
4,Does the job!,So far so good - our daughter hasn't arrived yet so I can't speak to it's absorbancy or anything like that. I will say it washed well and fit our porta-crib perfectly.
2,Shrunk,"I finally got the mattress cover, washed it per the instructions....and it shrunk! Could barely get it on the mattress. Very disappointing."
4,Nice for price,this product was brought for a play yard didnt fit the one we purchased but seemed to be a good product but i had to return.
1,Not comfortable at all,"This pad doesn't add any comfort. What a waste of money when we bought it for our first child. Our son didn't like sleeping in the playard at all. Now we are using the mattress topper by MamaDoo Kids with our daughter, which we received as a gift, and what difference! Not only it has the perfect dimensions and but it makes the playard super comfy."
2,Not for pack n play,"I ordered this for a pack n play just to see. It is too loose. So in case you are wanting to try this for your own pack n play! Also, I don't know why but I kind of assumed American Baby meant made in the USA. But it was made in China, FYI."
3,Calificación del producto y el envío,"El producto no cumplió totalmente mis espectativas, pensé que era un poco mas grueso, el envío si fue rápido y seguro"
5,Porta-Crib Mattress Pad is 5-Star,"The American Baby Company Waterproof porta-crib mattress pad is excellent! Soft, durable, installs easily, and washes well. Our grandbabies slept well!"
1,Bad measures,"I bought this item because the measures seemd good for the babybjorn travel crib. Actually the measures are wrong, the true meassures are a couple of inches shorter and it is unusuable with the babybjorn crib."
2,Disappointed,I've never left a review before but felt I should on this one. Our now has a big hole in the back after only the 2nd time washed. I've never had this happen with any mattress pad cover before so I was really disappointed.
1,Not for Graco Pack n Play!,"Despite the fact that this item appears when using search terms for pack n play mattress pad, it is too small for the specific product and crunches the mattress up. It should not be associated with this product, although it might fit other portable cribs. Stay with the product made by Graco with the appropriate size."
4,Very comfy and soft,"I purchased this to use on a portacrib 3"" mattress for my grandson when visiting. It is super soft and appears very comfortable. He actually slept very well."
1,Very small,"I found the American Baby Sheets and Mattress pads very small for the mattress that actually comes with the pack n play, and extremely thin. When I put them on, they bent the corners of the pack n play mattress, and even did the same to the after-market mattress I bought (but they fit the after-market mattress better). So I'm off to buy the actual Graco version in the hope s that it will be a better fit."
1,worthless,Attempted to wash the product prior to first use according to to directions and it melted. Worthless.
1,SHRINKS LIKE CRAZY - DO NOT BUY,"I bought two of the pads for a Graco Pack and Play. I made sure to try them to ensure a good fit before washing them and pre-wash they fit perfectly. One cold wash and a tumble dry and they shrunk to the point where they no longer fit and are unusable. They are so small that they make the PNP mattress fold up on itself. A waste of money and I cannot return them now that they have been washed. Not sure what would happen with a cold wash and a line dry, but be warned."
4,Do Not Dry in the Dryer,"The mattress has excellent quilting and padding; however, it cannot be dried in the dryer on a LOW setting. Would recommend washing; then hang to air dry. If you have a dryer with an air dry setting use that. Washed and hung the mattress cover then air dried; when almost completely dried; placed it in my dryer on the air setting which dried it perfectly. For my own personal information,once dried, I set my dryer setting to low heat and immediately you could smell the vinyl backing. When I removed the mattress cover after a few SECONDS there was a tiny scorched area on the end of the mattress cover."
5,Meets all expectations,I wouldn't let my new grand daughter lay on just anything...this wasn't just anything!! Super great experience!! Would order again.
2,This item DOES NOT FIT Baby Bjorn Crib Light 2,Unfortunately I believed a previous review that this item fits the Baby Bjorn Crib Light 2 and upon checking out when Amazon said the Baby Bjorn is often purchased with the American Baby Waterproof Quilted Crib cover and the fitted sheet - I purchased both. NEITHER FITS so listen to Baby Bjorn when they say ONLY Baby Bjorn sheets fit our Baby Bjorn crib light 2!
2,Way too thin,"We purchased this to use with our DaVinci mini crib and it is way too thin to use as a main mattress. If it was for travel with a pack and play it would be fine, but not to use as a baby's main crib mattress. The Crescent 5"" mattress is the one we ended up with and is perfect."
3,Porta-Crib Mattress Pad,Had to send back because I didn't see the word Porta Crib. Too short for baby mattress.
4,"Great, flexible helmet - accessories not as listed","This is a great, multipurpose bicycle helmet for city life. Please note that this ""helmet with accessories"" includes just three accessories, not four as listed in the Product Description. It comes with the rain cover, the light and the mirror, but not the winter kit (retail $25)."
3,One of the very best tells some stories,"This book unlike his other work, SuperSystem a Course in Power Poker, is not going to do much or your poker game. It is a group of articles he wrote for an out of print gambling magazine. They are recollections of playing on the underground trail of big-poker games in the 50's through the 70's and then playing for vast sums of money in Vegas. Some of the stories are quite good but not all are exactly gripping. If you didn't already know many of the points these stories make, e.g. pay attention to your opponents, know yourself, no limit is a different kettle of fish than limit poker, etc. then you might want to reconsider playing for anything more than nickels. This book is pretty much for hardcore poker fans only."
1,This book is a joke!,"What a terrible book! It reads like the author just cribbed from other film books, having no insights of his own. In addition, the author only seems to have an interest in films made in the past ten years - anything before 1960 is given only the most cursory mention - and many filmmakers and films not mentioned at all! To leave out most of the silent era and German expressionism in particular is stupidity of the highest order. (not a mention of Pabst, for example, or his Pandora's Box or Threepenny Opera). Instead he blathers on about the most obscure independent films by bad American filmmakers that were done in the past five years - this book is little more than a laundry list of directors that can be garnered from any history of film book. Skip it."
4,"Bravo, Anne!","Anne Lamott has brought a shining example of writing to the forefront. Her characterization of Mattie is real, genuine, and it's life at the end of the day. It's the little things that we try to overcome in our own lives that she has written about. Being rejected by a mate, being applauded by children, being disappointed by our parents...all of those equal the grand scope of our lives. Thank you, Anne, for a job well done."
2,not very good,"I found that the book was easy reading and it didn't really have any point to it at all. I wouldn't recommend it. It just kind of dragged on and told the story of this woman's life and the events in it. The ending was really bad, too."
1,Near Torture....,"I finished this painful read last evening and can only say that I have yet to read a book that is more tedious than Blue Shoe.Several reviewers, smarter than I, quit (while they were ahead) before finishing it and, oh, how I wish that I had!The main characters grates like chalk across the board, in their lack of substance, vacuous self-centeredness, and purposeless lives. In the lead, is Mattie. A milk toast of a woman living a gray life as a victim. Her divorce is boring, her affairs are dull, her parenting weak bordering on bad. There are no lessons learned or insights found in the draining excuse of an existence Ms. Lamott created for her. Peel me a grape...and please do yourself a favor and pass this one up."
2,What a disappointing read,"I love Anne Lamott's non-fiction so I was hoping to enjoy her fiction as well but this book wasn't for me. The main character, Mattie, is a super whiner who needs Nanny 911 for her kids as well as for herself. Skip this book and go for Lamott's non-fiction!"
1,Really awful,"How many times can you say it's raining? For several paragraphs?How many pages do you need to say that Winter is Back again and again and again and it's foggy, and now the son is 2 and now he's 3 and now he's....you get the idea.In a book of total boredom of trivial detail, we have a page here and there of a story of Our Heroes' father impregnating the daughter of a friend and other unpleasantness as THE explanation of why their mother and their families are a falling apart.I rarely throw books out, but this one went to recycling. I hope the new paper gets a better story printed on it."
1,Not her best work,"I am a big Anne fan, have read and bought all her books. However, this one won't make it to my personal library- I tried to like it, I really did, but it just doesn't come up to par with her other work. I was confused about what was happening for most of the book and more importantly, why any of it was happening. I never did understand why that one character (can't recall her name) lived in a run-down house on the beach with no electricity and acted crazy. There was not much of a plot, which is okay as long as character development is strong but we don't get that in here either. There was so much potential because all the characters appeared in-depth and complicated and interesting but we never get told why any of them act the way they do! I'm sorry to say I was disappointed in this book and can't recommend it."
2,"amusing, barely","I didn't find the characters so hateful, but I did think the plot meandered to the point where I was surprised when the book ended. nothing gets resolved, it just ends. mattie's final decision regarding daniel is really baffling. and the final foot-washing thing was really over the top.also as is common in anne lamott books, there is a lot of praying and good-hearted people smiling warmly/shyly at each other. Which is nice in a way but also getting a little old."
2,Disappointing,"I'm a fan of Lamott's work, and even this novel her use of the language is at times beautiful and brilliant. However, I can't recall reading a book whose protagonist was less compelling. Mattie struck me as whiny, tedious, and meandering. I wasn't sure what, outside of herself and the ho-hum mystery about her father, she cared about. I would give it one star, but because I read it after The Lovely Bones, I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt and assuming the comparison did not help."
3,A bit of reality in the insanity,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. At times, I found it a bit dark and depressing, but in it I saw a bit of everyone I know embedded in its characters. As always, Ms Lamott's writing is hypnotic and poetic in a funny and sometimes melancholy way."
1,"Same old, same old","If you've read Bird by Bird, Operating Instructions or Traveling Mercies, don't bother with this one. Anne has simply recycled her same old material, giving the characters new names. She can be so funny and droll, I'd just love to see her branch out and try something new, stretch herself, maybe even pick a different setting for a change. Would not recommend."
2,Where's the story?,"I listened to about half of the audiotape, waiting for something, anything to happen, aside from a bunch of whining and meandering dialog. While ""slice of life"" novels can be great, this one just had nothing to give it forward momentum. Sometimes, things were too ordinary, and other times, too hard to believe, such as that a 7-year-old would become practically suicidal because his dad's girlfriend was expecting. Halfway through this long slog, I was just so bored, I gave up. Overall, a mess of a novel. I expected more from Anne Lamott."
1,What's with the blue shoe?,"I have read all of Lamott's books, fiction and nonfiction, and was a fan. I have to admit, though, this will be the last one unless she makes a leap in her writing. I have officially tired of her characters who screw up their own lives and then ask for God's help to unscrew them. The plot rambles with no resolution, mistakes are repeated obsessively, and the characters are stuck in low gear. If this resembles real life for readers then a word of advice ... you only get one shot at life, go out and live it! Yes, yes, yes, we all loved Mattie's honesty with herself but that serves no purpose if you go back and do it again. The mother daughter relationship was the only redeeming quality for this book. And what is up with that blue shoe? There really are so many books and so little time ... skip this one."
2,Disappointing,"I'm a huge fan of Anne, but this one lost me. Four years of self-centered whining? Missed the insight. Guess the one mind-thread of the protaganist discussed the fact that she couldn't care for an aging mother's advanced care needs unless she sold the mother's house. Catch? The self-centered, minimally employed daughter now called mom's house ""hers"". Sign of the times? Had trouble identifying..."
2,Not the Anne I love,"I bought this book eagerly hoping to be as uplifted and mesmerized as I have been by all her previous books. I was disappointed from the beginning, but stuck with it because I couldn't imagine it wouldn't get better. But it didn't! The story was predictable, the characters uneven and uninteresting, and the preachy comments annoying. She communicated her christian faith in ""Traveling Mercies"" with wit, finese, and grace, but none of this transpired in the pages of her current novel. I felt the characters were shallow and much of the content of the book read like a dime store romance novel rather that what her readers have come to expect from such a talented writer.I am still an Anne fan, but this one I won't recommend."
1,Blue Shoe,"This is the first book of hers I have read - I was not impressed; read halfway through and took it back to the library. Dull, boring and depressing."
1,Almighty Anne,"I lenjoyed Ms. Lamott's books more when she didn't preach to me. ""All New People"" and ""Rosie"" were great novels and, although they may have served as religious channels for the author, they never felt pushy. ""Blue Shoes"" does not seem to be about a particular character but instead serves as a personal preaching card for the author. What a disappointment to loose such a gifted writer to the zombie treading world of the born-again Christians."
1,Mattie is a Christian??,"Actually, I can't even give this novel one star.This is the first ""Christian"" novel I've read, so I have never read Anne Lamott prior to Blue Shoe, and probably never will again. In my opinion, all the characters are lacking substance and completely unbelievable except as parody. Mattie is shallow and self serving; her children's well being is secondary to needing a man to keep her warm in bed. This is probably all right because Jesus understands her. .If any of the the characters had an ounce of warmth and if Lamott's ""Christianity"" not inserted at inappropriate places, the novel might be more enjoyable and the family and situation somewhat believable."
1,worlds worst similes,"Tedious overall; notable are the funny, puzzlingly surreal, world's worst similes. ""The animals sprinted to the kitchen at her heels like hungry Secret Service agents...."" Hunh?"
2,"blue shoe, so what?","We read this book in my book club, and nobody liked it. The style was more a vignette than a novel, and it didn't seem to have much of a point. It's not the worst book I've ever read, but it comes close."
2,Not too bad to quit reading,"At least this book held my attention. I finished it all. There has only been one book that I have put down: Pride and Prejudice. Blue Shoe is a bit more interesting, yet still boring. I randomly picked it up at a bookstore, since the ""New York Times Bestseller"" at the top caught my eye. Bestseller? This book barely kept me awake. There is no point to it. It's predictable, and even the family secret is ho-hum. There are a few funny instances in the novel, but the rest is pitiful. Poor kids, their mother is a bad parent. Seems to be more interested in men than in her children. Don't read it."
2,"Agree, not her best","I am a big fan of Anne Lamott, but this book was not very good. It seemed to be much the same as the Rosie books, but with different characters with different problems and none of the magic. There are lots and lots of seemingly extra characters who aren't developed. The plot is pretty sketchy and it didn't seem to pick up until the last 85 pages. My favorite works of hers are Rosie, Crooked Little Heart and Traveling Mercies."
1,Who is she kidding?,"Who is she--by this I mean both Anne Lamott and her central character Mattie--kidding? Mattie is a mess, no matter how ""endearingly,"" who at the end has little to redeem her--her selfishness and blindness are overwhelming. She's sleeping with her ex-husband, who has re-married and whose new wife is expecting. And she is coveting another woman's husband. No matter how disagreeable the ""other women"" may be, there is no excuse for Mattie's behavior, nor her lack of honesty and candor. And she seems incapable of doing anything short of praying--and I'm a great believer in prayer. I usually enjoy Anne Lamott tremendously, and her characters equally--especially because of their flaws and their faith. But I found Blue Shoe to ask too much, even of Lamott's faithful."
1,disappointing journey,"Blue Shoe was a miserable ride from begining to end. I loved Bird By Bird, also by Anne Lamott, but Blue Shoe was completely horrible. I kept waiting for some lessons to be learned, maybe some hope to be found for the obviously fragile children. Nothing. I can appreciate struggle and grief and mental instability as much as anyone, but frankly I just didn't care about any of the characters in this book. I had to force myself to pick it up every night all the while hoping that the ending would make the read worthwhile, but I had no such luck. Sorry Anne, but Blue Shoe was just too blue for me."
3,An OK book,"As an Anne-Fan it pains me to give this book three stars, but in all honesty it wasn't her best work. I liked the story, however it lacked the snap that usually grabs my attention. If you're looking for a story that dives into the complexities of real, everyday relationships pick up Joe Jones (a five star book by any means).If you're a fan, don't pass this book up because it's getting a three star average. It's a really nice story and contains enough Anne humor to make you snicker in public."
3,Not every at bat can be a home run,"I have loved Anne Lamott's writing, humor and life perspective for some time and was anxious to read ""Blue Shoe."" I must reluctantly admit that I am a bit disappointed with this latest effort. In some ways I enjoyed the slow, meandering pace of the book and appreciated the poingency of her descriptions of ordinary life and her ability to find perfection in parting with a beloved dog, mothering a dying mother and stuggling with moody, insecure children. The biggest problem with the book is a lack of substantive plot. I kept waiting for something climatic to happen and it never did. Maybe, that's Ms. Lamott's point on some level--life is just a meandering journey without an identifiable plot."
2,2 and 1/2 Stars,"I've heard a lot of good things about Anne Lamott. This is the first book I've read by her and it was okay but not great. She has a rather rambling style of writing and as she meanders about, seems to have some keen insights. I did grow weary of the main character's complaining but she did bring out observations about the human dilemma of caring for our children and our aging parents. I had problems with her rationalization of the main character's moral behavior as well."
5,A sweet fun book,"I loved this book. The heroine was strong and likeable. Instead of letting herself be bullied by the people in her life -- her daughter, her ex-husband, and the policeman -- she lives life on her own terms. I also loved the supporting characters, especially Harmonica Jack who is the sweetest character. I hope this turns into a series."
3,Over the top but highly readable,"Seeing the highly positive and negative reviews here I have to offer a mixed opinion. This is definitely on the very dark side, and at times it seems so disconnected from reality that you have to ask what the point is. But it's beautifully written, and if you're the type who doesn't ask that fiction be hunky-dory it's quite readable. I took it on vacation, which may seem perverse, but it's a page-turner in its way. It features what may be the kinkiest marriage in the history of literature. The book is a period piece from the late 1980s with effective use of icons of that time such as Robert Mapplethorpe's photography."
3,Another double life story from Theroux,"Chicago Loop, another Theroux story about a man's double life, was good enough to carry me to the last page but if you are new to Theroux you can do better (Try Kowloon Tong or My Secret History). Theroux's depiction of loneliness and desperation is convincing. He paints both the lead and his victims (male and female) with a bold yet sympathetic brush. He also treads, successfully, a fine line by presenting the perpetrator as part victim and ultimately a willing and complete victim. Ultimately he raised in my mind the difficult question - what is a victim other than a victim of oneself? but was astute enough to not answer his own dangerous question."
5,Time Civil War Set,"The Time Civil War Series is a great comprehesive overview of the the Civil War from the causes up through reconstruction. Rebels Resurgent: Fredericksburg to Chancellorsville is a ensential part of this series as this is the period when Lee's Army of Northern Virginia was at its best, not only defeating the Army of the Potomac, but literally fighting circles around them despite being at an extrme numerical disadvantage. Mr. Lincoln on the other hand, possessed his biggest challenge of the war: finding a commanding general in the east, who not only would take the fight to the enemy, but do it in a competent manner. Casualties were high, and results and morale were low. Again, a great book, illustrated in a correlating manner."
3,Good Family Movie,"Bought this item for my former boss, who is a pastor. He loves horses and enjoyed the movie. It has good scenery and he stated it was a good family movie."
2,disappointed,"Overall, I was pretty disappointed with this album. Doesn't measure up to ""Steel Wheels"" which is probably their best or their work from the 60's."
2,Not enough color.,This book contained mostly black and white photos. There are a couple other much better baby scrapbooking books.
1,Overrated,"Very weak scent and a little odd - not bad per se, but just strange. Almost like the scent you get from a computer or TV that is hot from being on all day - that mixed with a soft touch of leather. Sadly, another trial that didn't pan out for me."
5,wonderful,This book explores the Past and Present of Afghanistan. It is wonderful historical book and I highly recommend it to professors and students. It was written with great detail and love. The author is a mastermind who is full of knowledge and wisdom.
5,14 year old girl,I LOVE THESE BOOKS! I've read all of them so far. I am like the biggest star wars freak in the whole entire world! I would DEFINITLY recommend the J.A series for any huge Star Wars fan! I also recommend the Jedi Knight series. And anything with OBI-WAN KENOBI IN IT! May the force be with you!
5,One of the best one's!,I go this book a couple of weeks ago and just love it. I alsogot #8 and I found that in a catalog. #8 is the best out of all theother Jedi Apprentice and I hope Waston keeps the Jedi Apprentice books coming they are great! I would give it 20 Stars if I chould along with #8. ( ). END
4,Return to the Fantastic,"I keep thinking to myself that Jude Watson is no J.K. Rowling, but now I'm beginning to think that I'm deluding myself. The Captive Temple is, as we've come to expect from Watson, a fantastic read. Most remarkable of all is the way Watson is able to depict Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon, twelve years before The Phantom Menace. What is masterful is that these both are and are not the characters we saw in the movie; they appear exactly as they must have been in their younger days. Remarkable.The Captive Temple is also an improvement over the previous book. Obi-Wan is less mopey (""Mopey-Wan"" . . . hmmm), and Qui-Gon less brooding. There are no quick fixes to their relationship, broken by Obi-Wan's betrayal of Qui-Gon in book 5, which is satisfyingly frustrating. Watson seems to have masterly paced the evolution of our Jedi heroes' relationship, giving us just enough development to keep us coming back for more."
4,Intro to Atheology 101,"I came across this one at a local book store in my neighborhood, and it was a very good find. I had never heard of this book, nor do I recall any other Atheist sites that list it, yet I rate it with Martin's Atheism: A Philosophical Justification as one of the better books on the subject. The author does not cover the basics anywhere near as thorough as Smith does, but the book is a nice introduction to Atheological arguments. Attempts are made to discredit the existence of God, and the very concept of some of His attributes (such as omnipotence, omniscience, et cetera). Most entertaining of all, Gale touches on the question of things God can and cannot create (such as four-sided triangles, et cetera). While these are questions that many theists have tried to wave off as absurd or even sophomoric, Gale does a great job of giving them a more sound quality"
2,An insult to Faulkner,"Why oh why did she have to come out with her own box set with her name on it....some of the best pieces of literature sold in a ""box set"" to get even more promotion for herself. Doesn't anyone else see that she is putting her name on one of the best authors of all time? doesn't this bother anyone else? this woman who's show is so fake and stupid. Faulkner is turning in his grave. I love Faulkner, he is a genius, and i'm sorry but i dont think that this is right."
3,Faulkner review,These are very difficult books to read. Faulkner is a great author and the books do have a great story to tell.
2,As I lay dying,"This book is extremely difficult to follow the language used and the constant change of character. I still have not finished this one to start the others but Sparknotes is a good resource to get through difficult texts & has proven beneficial in getting me through some of this one. I am not quitting reading this, I have accepted the challenge :)"
2,As I Lay Dying,It is so depressing. Do people live like this? I am not sure of the message here. I will read the other two; maybe they are better.
4,Just for the titles you should purchase this set,"Unlike other reviewers, I think Oprah's compilation of the three novels into a boxed set does not bastardize the work. Faulkner will always be a literary icon and this delivery vehicle can only increase his popularity. That being said, I wish Oprah did not put her name on the set: when a guest notes the books the discussion becomes more about her book club than the work.AS I LAY DYING: An excellent account told by each member of the Bundren family as they travels across Mississippi to bury Addie, the family matriarch. THE SOUND AND THE FURY: Caddy Compson's story is told through a moron, a maniac and a monster. What a great concept with fantastic writing ... ingenious. LIGHT IN AUGUST: Joe Christmas: is he black, is he white, is he Christ? A fantastic commentary on the elusiveness of racial equality.At the very least, borrow these from you public library."
1,As I lay Dying,I was hoping for a summer of fun reading. This book may be fascinating for some but it did not interest me enough to read the other two books that went with it. For an English class it would be great reading and you could really study it. But for summer reading it required just too much work. It really didn't seem the book to me that you could take to the pool and just enjoy.
1,As I Lay Dying,"I really disliked this story. People don't speak the way this is written. I read books for entertainment and it is not entertaining when you have to wonder all through the book what in the world the author's talking about. How did Faulkner ever get so famous? I felt like a kid asking ""what did he mean by"" and ""what does this mean""? I will never take an Oprah review seriously again. She really missed the boat on this one!"
1,An exhausting exercise in perplexity.,"Oprah, dear one, WHY? Give me Chekhov, Wharton, Plath, Dickens, Poe, but Faulkner? I appreciate the online assistance at Oprah.com and the Monday night lecture series to aid in understanding the atrocious grammer and quasi-English, but...the revelations to which it all leads isn't worth the pain and suffering of reading Faulkner.Did this author have an LSD addicition, because let's face it...he ""ain't right!"""
2,O Oprah,"AS I LAY DYING by William FaulknerI respect what he did, but I read about 15% of this one before I got bored. I don't agree with Oprah that he's difficult. I knew exactly where he was coming from and where he wanted to go. Many relevant themes and he was a damn fine wordsmith. But it's old news to this jaded old redneck. I don't know why. I realize I just dismissed an author who deserved his Pulitzers and his Nobel Prize, in a single short paragraph, but please hold back on the hate mail.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE SOUND AND THE FURY by William FaulknerDitto. You hate me, don't you?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------LIGHT IN AUTUMN by William FaulknerDitto. Hoo boy, now you want me dead."
1,Boring,"I thought it was boring and even though I am an avid reader, I didn't get far at all in any of the books. My tastes are just different."
4,Great collection,I got this product fast!Great set if you dont mind it saying something about Oprah on the front of it. Perfect gift for your hipster english major friends.
4,Boxed set has advantages,"I did consider buying all three books seperately, but this set is a beautiful addition to the bookshelf. The covers are lovely, the text/font is very readable and the softcovers are convenient. Reading the books in sequence made the experience even more meaningful."
2,Errr... not for me !,"I had a hard time to finish reading this package but... finally finished reading them after reading other books in between. I am quite surprised Oprah chose these books. In my opinion, she could have chosen a better books. Unless you really like challenge, I doubt you will real find time to finish reading these."
1,Not Worth the Cost,"This book is not worth the cost of buying it. I don't think I've ever seen such poor writing; there were times when sentences didn't even make sense. Add to that the poor punctuation, grammar and syntax, and the piece became almost impossible to read. I eventually managed to skim through the story to at least find out what happens to the two main characters, but since that outcome was predictable (I felt like I was back in high school, reading about the innane relationship issues from my teen years!), I'm not sure it was even worth the time I spent reading it."
2,what happened,"recover, you make me upset. i dont understand. i want to cry. this release is nothing like the goodness of the last cd. this album reeks of poppiness and happy radio tunes unlike anything i have ever heard before. i have never really understood what selling out was until this album met my ears. this cd is a definite step down from their last stellar release, lets hope that recover finds out how to make good music again someday."
5,Best Service,"I bought a 6 year old SPORTS Tutor machine via Craigslist. Turned out the battery had its life, lasted less than fourty minutes of play. Called Sports Tutor, brought it in and was planning on replacing the battery. Not only they replaced the battery for free, but they also tuned up my machine, including replacing the stickers. The staff was even concerned about my traffic condition - Friday afternoon Los Angeles traffic.Now the machine has been working as a champ. Battery lasts more than 4 hours of continuous playing. Plenty for my training. Also, my three kids - tennis beginers, love it too.Excellent service from a great company. Totally recommend this to someone who is shopping for a machine.Thank you, Ron!"
3,Review of the book BEFORE the trip,"The book doesn't have pictures to help us make decisions on where to go. We will still use the book while on the trip, and than I will be able to giva a better review..."
4,Best Places titles are a great source for your trip!,This is the second Best Places book I purchased (I also have Seattle). I have had incredibly good luck with all of the recommendations in these books. I just returned from a week in Cabo San Lucas and stayed at a hotel in this book that was wonderful and ate all of our meals at very reasonably priced restaurants recommended in this book...everything was great! My only complaint is that these books have very few maps in them. A good map of the area is a great companion to these books...but so is a good concierge who can make reservations and give you directions.
5,"Best Places Baja: The Best Restaurants, Lodgings, and Outdoor Adventure (Best Places Baja)",Book arrived in a timely manner and in excellent condition.
3,Pretty good,"The book was pretty good but it lacked thrill and excitement. After a while the book got really monotnous and I lost intrest quickly, although I read the whole book in 1 day. But it was a great story in a remarkable era in history."
3,arrsteph - My Review for Academy Extra Credit,"Bound for Oregon is the story of Mary Ellen Todd and her journey with her family along the Oregon Trail. Although this book was interesting in the first chapter, I think the author got a little carried away with the monotonus context of the book. All in all, it is a good book if you want to know more about this era in history and the Oregon Trail."
4,Allison's Bound for Oregon review,I thought this book was a pretty good book. It was very exciting. The first 2 chapters were boring but then it got interesting.
5,We thinks it's awesome.,"We give Bound for Oregon five stars and two thumbs way up! We thought the book was very interesting. There was always something amazing happening. We recommend it to students, friends, and family all around the world. By Bianca and Ashley"
4,Another nice WW II film,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.Overlord is a film about a group of British soldiers who are training for D-Day. The film contains a lot of actual stock footage from the war and is intercut with staged scenes made for the film.The DVD contains some excellent special features also.There are audio journals of two British soldiers recited by an actor, a theatrical trailer, a short film about Spanish artist Juan Genoves, a photo essay featuring director Stuart Cooper on photographer Robert Capa, a British anti-nazi propaganda film titled ""Germany Calling"" which appears in Overlord. It contaisn doctored footage of Nazi marches and souds effects which present the Nazis as fools. Also included is a ducumentary of the Britush Imperial War Museum's video archives and a 1943 film trubute to newsreel cameramen who filmed scenes of World War II."
3,Tweezers are easier,"Well, it seemed like a good idea. I'd tried a sugar depiliator, which was useless. My legs and underarms are satisfied with a good razor. But the bikini area needs more care. I'm not keen on strangers waxing my delicate areas, so I thought I'd give this a go.The end result is great, compared to shaving: no stubble! the hair grows back much slower; and the result is beautiful and sexy. But keeping the wax at the optimal temp is too much work without a warmer, and so much hair is left behind that must be cleaned up with tweezers, that I've found a bottle of champagne, a strong light, a good audiobook and a pair of reliable tweezers takes the same amount of time, is less messy, and gives a cleaner result!"
3,NOT A GAME,I suggest this product to everybody that gets a PS3 get 2 cords. works great holds controllers fine low cost quick ship.
2,A little disappointing,"A well intentioned book filled with statements of the obvious. I placed this item in our library at work, hoping by the title that it would somehow stimulate and inspire. Sadly, I don't think it engaged anyone."
1,pretentious book,"I bought the book based on other reviews however save your money, the books title and table of contents give the impression its a serious study when in fact it reads like a collection of motivational speaches strung together for book. It has sports analogies ad nauseum. Half way through I donated it to the local library"
5,It Works,I bought this a few weeks ago and it works great. I don't have to worry about banging up the front of my toons going in to docks. Its to early to tell how long it will last but for $25 i would purchase them again if they go bad just for the piece of mind.
1,Is this a sick joke?,"This ""book"" is not what anyone would expect for $50...it is simply a bunch of papers sloppily stapled together with less than wonderful advice for med school admissions -- I can't believe that I fell for this scam. Potential buyers beware!!"
4,Good book But why the AMA bashing!,"The book takes a very negative tone while almost accusing American Medical association for regulations etc. Although the reference to Yale Law Review, as per the Politics of organized medicine, is very useful to understanding the present system but AMA is not all bad; its system has produced good doctors like my dad who do care about the patients. Overall, this is a very useful and practical guide to medical school admissions. Many of the procedures revealed are so secretive that it makes one really wonder about the legitimacy of the system. A less harsh tone for AMA would be much appreciated."
4,Delicious mushroom soup!,"I bought this soup out of curiosity based on it's title. It's a cream of mushroom soup, with lots of chucks of mushrooms, in a very rich cream broth. I loved it!"
2,Not a book for a neophyte,Assumes a great deal of previous knowledge and is really not a primer on Indian history. Difficult to follow and make sense of.
2,Torture,Read this book if you want dry fact after dry fact with zero entertainment value. Pure torture. I feel sorry for any student who is assigned this one.
2,Two lovers and a naughty-bore of a child,"The Metcalf's have produced a book rich in factoids, post-colonial sentimentalism, and wretched prose. Clearly, the authors had good intentions in terms of contriving a history that implored us to mock the sunny empire. However, instead of focusing on their keen ehtical duty to educate against empire, they should have considered the horror that comes with mirthless prose and inevitable colonization of any passionate interest the reader ever had."
3,Banality of Evil on Video,"This recreation of the Wannsee Conference focuses more on the banality than the evil. For example, there are jokes about the ""Protokol"" (the minutes of the meeting). This is not the same video as ""Conspiracy"" (2001, HBO), which offers more of a look at the substantive issue behind the conference, and the sociopathic personalities involved."
3,Refreshing,"Not all the tracks on this album are great but there are enough good tracks on it to make it an average buy (worth it for some of the tracks) if you like guitar virtuosity.the track EEE is ingenious and mindbending. great technical playing, melody and inventiveness. very enjoyable track.the other tracks feature a lot of fun... there is the 1 or 2 mediocre song in the album but they are compensated by the other songs that contain robust guitar rythmns and blazing beautiful licks.if you're a die hard fan, this is not a waste of money. sure there are songs in the album that are nu metal... but his playful solos make a difference."
5,Simply Amazing,Im a huge fan of Paul and i am happy to see him put out a CD of this instrumental type. There are many people doing instrumental music but Pauls is exciting and fun to listen to. He gives you exactly what a shred lover wants. PLAY MORE!!! :) I am also in awe of his bass lines and sound!! Paul has mastered the Sheehan tone perfectly. I think Paul does Billy's recorded sound better than Billy! At that is no small feat! Anyway do yourself a favor and pick it up. You wont be disapointed.
2,It's not all about notes,Lacks the breadth and depth of an album worth repeated listening. I'd recommend spending dollars on a well known bald Bay area guitarist whose compositions astound and have emotional tension.
4,Good to see an Instrumental CD from Mr. Gilbert,"This CD doesn't seem to be as slickly produced as I would have expected, but the tracks are really good. Some may think instrumental guitar records can lean a little bit into self indulgence, but heck when you are as good as the ""G3"" guys..."
5,Smell Me,That's right I am irresistible now that I am wearing my Burberry.The ladies flock to me where ever I go.Timely shipping smooth transaction.
5,Burberry's Weekend,My husband has used this cologne for years. The price on Amazon is MUCH cheaper than in the stores. It is also getting harder to find on a retail level.
3,... Only O.K....,"I bought this without sampling it based on my taste for Burberry, Burberry Brit, and Burberry Summer. This cologne is in a whole different league then those. It'd definitely clean and fresh smelling, but it definitely has a floral scent overall. I was surprised since the other burberry's would be hard to be mistaken for anything but a male fragrance. I think this could almost be a unisex fragrance.I still enjoy it though. Definitely save it for the summer time though. I can't pull it off in the winter as I'm too burly of a man at 6'4 to be wearing this with my carthart coat in the winter."
4,Authentic-sounding sea chanties,"If you want to know how sea chanties originally sounded on the decks and under them back in the 18th and 19th centuries, this is an album for you. It can be a time-consuming process to sort through the load of sea chanty albums out there that when you're trying to find the traditional sound. Therefore, if you like the sound of this album I also recommend the following albums, composed by various performers including some on this album: Blow the Man Down; Round Cape Horn; Shanties & Songs of the Sea. These albums have a great mix of emotion in them, from rip-roarin' drinking songs to inspirational working songs to melancholy tunes about ships that were swallowed up by the sea."
2,it did have potential,"This album failed to meet my expectations. The titles are why I bought it.Unfortunately, the arrangements are horrible; the voices are REALLY bad.It left a sour taste in my soul."
3,Hey...Sub-Par...,"1. Children's books represent some of the best literature in the world.2. If you are above children's books, you had better go back to school to learn how to spell. Get a personal editor."
4,The Devil and his Boy,"My 1st Anthony Horowitz and it was pretty cool. It was kinda creepy, but it still had an interesting storyline."
1,Sub-Par,"I found this book kind of ridiculous. It is silly when it isn't supposed to be.Horowitz exaggerates some of the nastier aspects of Elizabethan society to the point of caricature, but it doesn't work -- he presents nothing truly horrifying. Despite the best efforts of the author, ""The Devil and His Boy"" seems very modern. I was suprised to find out how much of the story Horowitz claims he ""based on fact.""The characters aren't well-developed, and the book treats the themes of morality and honesty very lightly. The choices that the main character makes seem too easy. He refuses to turn to crime, but this comes off as unrealistic and sanctimonious, not heroic. The ending of the book is not a surprise at all.If you're looking for a good YA book on plays and Elizabethan England, try Susan Cooper'sKing of Shadowsinstead."
3,a careful guide on investing in emerging equity markets,"This book is a must for those seeking to diversify their portfolios. Mitchell Postner has shown the pros and cons of investing in emerging markets, such as the high currency and political risk and the high rewards that come in investing in companies that are poised to grow at a rate faster than what one would expect in North American markets."
3,"Nice prose, but too self-indulgent","This was a well-written and well-paced book, but I felt Martin could have better served his readers by adding a touch of humor. This book was just too melodramatic for me to connect with or have any sympathy for the ""protagonist."" That's another thing: I don't understand why this is disguised as fiction. There aren't any characters and it's so obviously autobiographical. It's all about Martin, his family and the rock star (Michael Stipe). Relationships are hard, and break-ups can be sad and very painful, but reading this account of one without any real self-reflection, humor or analysis just got tiresome after awhile. But, it's definitely not a terrible book, and I would still recommend it solely because Soft Skull Press rocks and, as an independent press, needs your support."
3,Waiting to stop waiting,"A young narrator attends college in a small Georgia town, and becomes the lover of a famous rock star. Their relationship is destroyed by the narrator's passivity and the lover's celebrity (the tours, etc.). Martin's sparse and near poetic style is rather intriguing, but overall it left me wanting."
1,Beware - don't buy,"Do not buy a Samsung Player. We bought one, had to upgrade it to see 'Rise of the silver surfer' and it broke. So right now we have a player that has a Blu-Ray disc stuck in it and the only thing it ever does is greeting us with 'Hello' on its display when powering on and saying 'goodbye' when powering off. We tried to got support but unfortunately all they said is, that it is all our fault. Actually we have been accused very badly for doing something illegal. We got the feeling that they would have loved to put us in prison for trying an upgrade...."
1,Samsung BD-P1200,"The Samsung BD-P1200 looks great for a paper weight, as delivered and is incapable of playing Blue Ray Disk unless you go on line and download version 1.4 (Image), you must download in ""Image"", otherwise it will damage the unit. The next generation Blue Ray disk will not work because existing Samsung's will not have the necessary hardware. Most of these good reports must have been written by Samsung, there are a number of class action lawsuits going on."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PLAYER,"This Samsung BD-P1200 Blu-ray player is worthless if you want to watch current Blu-ray DVD's.The list of movie titles that it has problems playing is increasing every month.Samsung's website say's they are working on a fix, so I guess until then, I just wont try to watch any new released movies."
1,Horrible,"This player is almost as much of a piece of crap as the first gen Samsung player. It has disc compatibility issues, won't play certain discs. It is slow, shoddy HDMI connection, overpriced and just sucks."
1,Firmware update bricks player,"Player worked fine until we needed to upgrade the firmware using the built in tools. Unfortunately the firmware killed the player and now it's useless. Even worse, Samsung says the firmware was at fault but they will not fix it unless we pay for the repairs and shipping. Needless to say, we're not buying anything Samsung ever again."
1,Complete Junk,Just a huge expensive piece of junk. I'll never buy a Samsung again as long as I live.
1,I've had enough.,"Today, February 26, 2009, is the day I cut my losses and buy a new player. After fighting with the Samsung for almost two years, I've had enough. During that time, there was never a moment where all the discs in my collection played properly...or, in some cases, at all. The first firmware update helped, but subsequent attempts seemed to do nothing. AND even if they had, about 50% of the audio CD's that I try to play on it skip. They always have. And I suspect that no firmware update is going to address that. The most maddening thing about this is that, being an ""early adopter"" of the format, I paid a fortune for this thing. It's going to be a lonnnnggg time before I consider buying another Samsung product."
1,A piece of junk.,I purchased this player last May. It is useless. It will not play many Blue-ray discs. It requirers a firmware update that the company is in no hurry to manufacture. My player will no long play any CDs. Support is a joke. The right hand does not know what the left hand is doing. They will not honor their warranty. I will never buy any other product that Samsung manufactures.
1,Buyer beware,"I have a Samsung Blu-Ray player (BD-P1000) which I bough 3 months ago from Amazon. I also purchased the Blu-Ray Pirates of the Caribbean Blu-Ray disk. Guess what? The Samsung player won't play the disk - won't even load it.Before buying the BD-P1200, make sure it will play the disks you want. How will you know? I guess call Samsung."
2,"Incompetent service, horrible firmware upgrade process","Incompatible with some newer blu-ray discs: firmware 'upgrade' lost sound and visual quality for all dvds, with no way to revert to the earlier firmware. Samsung support is very, very poor on this: they said we'd have to phone every few weeks until their engineers released a new patch, and we could not watch anything until then.This player is also very slow to load, and hangs from time to time."
3,Great picture and sound,"I really like the product when it works. I had a problem upgrading the firmware. I followed the directions and burned a cd. The update hung at a screen for over a half hour. Support told me to kill the power. I was apprehensive since I know it can screw things up. Sure enough, killing the power made it so it didn't work at all. Couldn't even open the tray. Sent in over a month ago for repair and still haven't gotten it back. Samsung now said they will send a replacement since it has taken well beyond a reasonable repair time. Hopefully I get a replacement unit soon. That is what we get for embracing a new technology."
3,review,"i like the cd but on the display page on amazon, it says 2 discs, one with other artists on it, but just got the one main disc, so do not understand that."
3,Lost thouch with their roots...,"An excellent disc, but this South Dakota quartet lost a little bit of what made ""Sunsets and Carcrashes"" so special. The lack of acoustic numbers on the disc was appalling. ""Sunsets and Carcrashes"" was mostly lyrically driven acoustic numbers where as I think some of ""One Fell Swoop"" gets lost in all that big band feel. Nonetheless give it a shot...still lyrically amazing."
4,comparative study of the Asian tigers,"Ramesh performs a comparative study of Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan, in the areas of income, health, housing and education. These countries had successfully newly industrialised. Hence the book can be treated as an effort to find commonalities for these successes. It is a strong statistical study, with numerous citings of data to reinforce arguments.In education, the countries consistently spent heavily on creating universal literacy and on the majority of students being able to finish high school. Very commendable achievements, that were crucial in leading to skilled workforces. Basic health care was also provided to citizens. Though private health plans were often used, especially by the middle class. Housing was another area where governments strove mightily to ensure that at least a minimum was available. Homelessness was seen as highly undesirable."
1,Not at all what I expected!,"When I saw this Jack Johnson ""En Concert"" Blu-Ray I expected a high quality live concert! It is called ""En Concert"", however, you get a ton of black and white film footage of a camera man filming country side images from the car window as they drive past and images of the band surfing with some clips of live shows. I am a fan of Jack Johnson but this is not worth the money...buy the cd for the live music only."
1,Should not have been released as Blu-ray,"The five star raters are correct in one sense. It is a raw look at Jack and his tour. That concept is great, but the way it was filmed is basically a blu-ray oxymoron. If you would like to see grain well-defined on your screen, then pick this up. I am wondering if the classic style DVD may actually play better. Long story short, if you have to decide between the blu-ray and the CD, get the CD. ***Most important point is the style. If you are looking for the beautiful crisp Dave and Tim style Blu-Ray then pass on this one***"
1,En Concert,I was really looking forward to this blu ray dvd. After viewing I wish I had saved my money. The film looks like it was shot by a 12 year old on an old vhs camera.The music is great as they are all repeats but the format is not at all blu ray.
1,Mobile quality,"I got this DVD from a friend. First, I sent an email to him asking if he bought a black/white DVD. Then, I started to search on the DVD how to change it to blue-ray quality. After that, I went to Amazon to read the reviews and all users realized the same. Very sad.NOT RECOMMENDED. You can record any show from the TV and will get a better quality. :)"
1,Black and White video is unwatchable.... great music though!,"First off, I'm a Jack Johnson fan, but the people who filmed this was ""trying too hard"" with the special effects...Like many have already said... this concert is filmed in low resolution black and white and is not very entertaining to watch.The music is great though!"
1,jack johnson en concert,"don't get me wrong. i.m a big fan of jack johnson, have several of his cd's. the reason for the low rating is because i was unable to play either of the two cd's. one i ordered and the other a replacement. they would not play on my blu-ray or my computer."
1,EMARTBUY = INCOMPETENCE,"It's been over 19 days since my SanDisk 512MB Transflash card was ""shipped"" from EMARTBUY and I still have not received my order. When I contacted EMARTCRAP, all they could tell me was that it had been shipped. I am sure that flash card works great. I just hope that I will receive it before it becomes obsolete. AVOID EMARTBUY AT ALL COST. Don't settle for incompetency. Your are better off paying a higher price for better service...correction any service."
4,Such a tiny little thing...,"I bought thisSanDisk 512MB TransFlash microSD Card (SDSDQ-512-A10M, Retail Package)for my cell phone so that I could have music on me at all times, it is a handy little thing to have and it holds my pictures and music. The only thing I wish was that I bought one with more space."
5,TransFlash Card,"This item is GREAT!!! This particular size of microSD cards are impossible to find. Found on-line and couldn't be happier with it. Prices are unbeatable, service is fantastic, communication is fantastic. Will use this company again."
4,SanDisk 512MB TransFlash microSD Card,Works fine after figuring out how to get it in the Cellphone. Shipping costs way out of line.
5,As expected,It comes in the retail packaging and a little clear plastic case which holds both the card and the regular SD adapter. I got it for my LG CU500 phone and so far no problems at all!
2,SD Adaptor not useful,The microSD card is really small and delicate. The included SD adaptor is of no use and is poorly designed. It is not easy to remove the microSD card from sd adaptor once you insert it. You need a seperate microSD reader to use this card.
1,Be careful where you buy!,"The product (SanDisk microSD) is the same everywhere, so your choice is all on price and service. I tried to buy 1 card at the Amazon affiliate named Global Expo at the advertised $30.75 ... and a $30 shipping charge was added to my account, despite this being listed as ""free shipping"". Global Expo now claims they will charge me a $10 cancellation fee for immediately trying to cancel the order. Shame on Amazon for letting these thieves in!"
2,Careful what you buy,Purchased supposedly new and price was cheaper than anywhere else. Card contained existing files and could not delete them. Basically was of no use. Returned to Amazon and recieved full purchase price.
5,Excellent storage,"Bought this so I could expand the number of maps in my Garmin i3 GPS unit: offered as a bundle by Amazon. Works great, no complaints at all!"
5,Top notch microSD card,"I use this microSD card in my Samsung ZX-20. It has never had any problems with reading or writing data. It also transfers files very quickly, both to and from my PC with the included adapter. This is a top-notch, quality package that is well worth the money."
4,...,"Hmmm... now, could someone tell me where I've heard this before...death guitar samples, machine gun beats, and loud screaming. OH! WAIT! Atari teenage riot! Now don't get me wrong, the album is OK, but ATR does it 100 times better. Believe me, Im a HUGE Digital Hardcore fan, i own at least one album of every DHR artist. Im also willing to forgive the fact that Ec8or aren't very original, im somewhat lenient on that, but the truth is the only good songs on the album are; ""i dont wanna be a part of this"", ""think about"", and ""spex is a fat B!tch"". But you wanna know the funny thing? These 3 songs TOTALLY make the album worth buying."
1,RIP OFF - BUYER BEWARE,"1) Pic shows dog tag on chain. Didn't come with chain. Just dog tag part. 2) Ordered with expedited shipping, took 10 days to get here, missing Halloween (this was part of a costume) 3) Paid $8.95 for shipping - it came in a plain white envelope with the $1.31 postage on it.I wanted to give no stars b/c I'm not even 20% happy with it, but the system doesn't allow that."
3,VI,"We are now on the 6th film of the Saw series. I like Saw in general, the idea of it and all the neat traps. The first three films too me are the best and after that they start going down. Saw 4-6 are fine and i can watch them again but still. So maybe this movie would be the last one, with the last trap being the same as the first ever used trap which would have been a good complete ending. But it looks like they could make Saw VII if they wanted too. Guess we will know when Halloween comes by. Anyway, I like how it takes off right from the previous film and like i said, the traps are always cool and fun too watch. All in all, if you seen the first 5,you might as well see this one."
4,Very interesting Movie!,"This definitely completes the series of the SAW story. It does what it says, it comes full circle. If you own the other SAW movies, this is one to complete the set. I normally don't like sequels, yet, they sure did a good job in keeping this sequel interesting."
5,Surprisingly Good!,"It had the plot process of Saw I and the horror of Saw II, which made it an equal to the very first time I watched Saw I. I bought the Saw VI with the bonus dvd and accidently watched Saw I again before I wasted 6. So, it gave me a better comparison for this reveiw. I am not going into any details about 6 so with that stated my suggestion is to buy it or rent it. Enjoy!"
3,Saw is going downhill,"I've heard some people say that this is the best Saw since the first. I have to say, I don't agree at all. The traps are so violent and disregard all sense of innocence or independance that the whole ""point"" of Jigsawsgames seem to have been lost. Granted, this has been going on for the past few movies, and it might be a way to make Jigsaw's descent into lunacy a little more obvious, but I don't feel it works well. That being said, the traps themselves are rather unusual, some interesting and others just boring. I'd say, if you're a fan of the series give it a watch, just be prepared for a few unexpected changes to the characters and storylines."
5,Great movie!,Saw VI was one of the best movies I have ever seen! Can't wait to see how long they are gonna milk these movies!
4,Not too bad for a sequel,"This was one of the better sequels in the Saw family. It helped explain a lot of things and the challenges were also pretty good. But as usual, the ending left the calling card for another sequel."
3,A little disapointed,The movie was great don't get me wrong. What I was disappointed with was the fact that the movie was in 2-D but boasted 3-D with the title screen. I figured the company could have taken a few seconds to remove the 3-D from the title screens. Otherwise was a great movie and tied things in the Saw world together. This movie would have worked in anaglyph but I guess it is geared towred people spending 3-4 grand on tv's. Sad.
3,Good,"Saw 6 to me is a pretty good movie although, it seems the directors are starting to run out of story line and beginning to make up for it by adding in random stuff. maybe if a few things went down differently in a few of the past movies this wouldn't be an issue. But hey, they seem to be having no problem making money and alot of people really only watch it just to see what kind of new traps they've come up with anyways."
5,Saw movie collector,"I am a fan of all the Saw movies, what more can i say. The good thing it comes with Saw I, the first movie."
3,what another saw movie,I know its kind of bad of me reviewing this movie without even seeing it i just dont understand the concept of having so many saw movies. Up until the third saw movie i was a fan but jigsaws dead so how can they keep going this is like the sixth one. Come on are they gonna do this every halloween come up with something elese don't all good horror movie end in trilogys. im giving it three stars because the saw movies have been good up until the point when they released a fourth one..
1,Bad editing????,"I just ""saw"" this movie at the dollar theater and no one else has mentioned this but i saw the mic above all the actors heads following them around and hovering above them in the first half of the movie. Anybody else see this????? I also notice you could see the top of the sets lighting etc.... What the hell??? The movie was ok."
1,Saw Sucks,Saw if for little kids or people that think they know horror films this movie sucks along with the rest of the series if you like this your not a real horror fan its just to make money of each film for you to keep watching and yet thats how ppl are stupid just to go and keep watching this garbage
3,FOR THE SIXTH FILM IN THE SERIES THIS IS VERY GOOD!,"I enjoyed the original Saw film, but the second film was a little disappointing. The third, fourth and fifth installments were all entertaining and a step in the right direction. I didn't expect much when I heard about this sixth installment because how many times can you keep drawing from the same well?......Well,...... I guess as many times as you can find imaginative people who want to make an interesting film.Saw VI starts off where the part five left off. What is amazing about these films is that they never seem stale even though we are getting more of the same. It's more like a continuing crime drama on TV with excessive gore! The films are to the point, have decent actors and always give a story that is at least fun to follow.For a film that is a fifth sequel, this is very very good!"
5,SAW 666,"This is definitely an awesome movie. Unlike alot of people, I've actually enjoyed all the saw's that have been released. But I didn't expect this one too be as good as I initially thought. The first scene is bloodier than any other opening saw scene. It even made me feel a little wierd, which for me is hard.The flashbacks, to me, make sense, and shouldn't throw people off, some people have said that they're confusing. Also glad they finally revealed what Amanda's note said on Saw 3. Overall, A really well thought out movie.And If you haven't seen this movie yet, watch it."
4,"MAYBE IT'S TIRED, BUT...","...this deserved to do better. Lost in all the PARANORMAL ACTIVITY hype, SAW VI is still a pretty effective entry in the franchise. Focusing on corporate baddies e.g. mortgage lendors and insurance companies, Jigsaw uses his acolyte to bring cruel justice in outrageously gruesome ways. And is the game over? Of course not...SAW VII is on its way!"
3,"If you've made it this far, don't miss Saw VI","Let's be honest. By now, you know what you're getting when you see a Saw film. The mainstream audience was weeded out two or three movies ago, so as much as critics complain about plot or acting, it doesn't matter.The bottom line is if you're in the niche that still likes Saw, and there's any chance you want to see/own Saw VI, go for it! It's the best Saw film since at least Saw III. We can all agree Saw V was terrible, but should be no indicator of quality for this installment. Saw VI proves that the franchise can still deliver good, low-brow entertainment for those who still appreciate the ridiculous plot twists and convoluted mythology.Jigsaw practically breaking the third wall midway through the film to give a blunt comment on current politics is worth the price in itself."
2,C'mon Now,"I love the Saw movies, but enough with the flashbacks. Did anyone notice that Jigsaw's wife looks younger now...even though she should be older??? And why does the FBI always have these offices that are so darkly lit?Plus wouldn't Jigsaw have gone after that ""evil"" insurance guy first? Not a lot later....."
4,SAW...Soap opera for horror fans!!!!!,Ima huge fan of the Franchise..but in Saw 6...every thing comes full circle NOT!!..... not Really at all ...i wont ruin it..but you will see that at the end of the film...the person that was ultimately tested escapes the jigsaw trap..OOPS!! SO now what we have here is room for ultimatley SAW 7....SWEEEEEEEEET!
3,Enough with this franchise already!,Ok the only reason why i gave this 3 stars is because its a saw movie if that makes any sense lol The only reason why i will be buying this dvd is to keep the collection going but i think saw should have ended after the 2nd or 3rd installment
5,Wonderful story and illustrations,"This is a wonderful story about a family dairy farm at the turn of the 20th century and how they struggled to adapt to changing technology and the growth of the population around them. The illustrations are also beautiful and give the story a warm, historic feel."
3,Pink Floyd - 'Live At Pompeii - Director's Cut' (Universal),"Review no.238.'Live At Pompeii' was filmed in October,1971 during the band's gig with no audience.Running time:91 minutes.Plenty of extra features,which I think I may like as much if not more than the actual performance.Sound could be better,plus there are too many extreme close-ups.An okay DVD to own.Tunes I dug the most were the strangely played ""Careful With That Axe,Eugene"",""A Saucerful Of Secrets"" and ""Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun"".Pretty much for Floyd die-hards."
1,Disappointing at BEST 2.0 Stereo??,"Ok, I am biased but since this is a DVD of an audio artist shouldn't the sound be REMASTERED and in 5.1 at the very least?? Yes, I will take what I can get but I, or some of my audio engineering friends would have done this FREE of charge just to get better audio on this thing. I've waited so long for this. Why do they release DVDs like this? Please REMASTER to 5.1 or BETTER and RE-RELEASE! Thanks!"
3,classic pink floyd,All in all it is a good dvd. Its a little jumpy and if you're in your 20's this is probably not for you.
1,"Booh, Hiss",This is not a music DVD. It is a movie about stoned out rock stars. I was very disappointed.
5,Adding to my earlier review,"I was reading through the reviews and saw that this guy didn't like the director's cut. Don't let that mislead you. If you watch the movie and don't like the director's cut, just go under the features and watch the original concert.i like that feature, you can watch the updated and/or the original thing. Also, you get to hear the story of this concert told by Adrian Maben himself.With a great variety of songs, and the environment to go with it, this is a perfect dvd. Shoot, I'm a child, and I watch this dvd over and over. I hope that you can enjoy this as much as I do."
5,VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.,dont heed any of the one star reviews on this page.this dvd features a great live performance from this classic band.five stars.
3,Adrian Maben is mad!,"Firstly I'd like to say that the original Pompeii is on here and that is the only reason to buy this DVD. The new directors cut is garbage. It has computerized fly throughs of Pompeii that wouldn't make it on the History channel, as well as new shots of Pompeii and other stock footage that really has no place in this classic Floyd concert film. The only thing of interest in the new version is the black and white interveiws from France. But these should have been added as extras on the DVD. Adrian Maben has totally ruined the flow of this film.The extras are weak at best and the interveiw with Maben is of little interest to anyone but perhaps this never-was's mother."
5,FINALLY on DVD....but....,"Pros:FAR superior picture quality over past issuesVERY good sound remix, including surround sound.Includes original version of filmCons:Director's cut shows LESS of the band playing and MORE statuary, street scenes, NASA footage, subway footage (including noise over the music!), CGI, other Floyd footage etc. What a mistake!Lackluster 'bonus' material (lyrics and press clippings that are too small to read, a few album covers, other material with NO description/explanation)Awkward menu.-----------So why five stars? The sound and picture are so improved, just watch the original version and ignore the rest."
5,How To Watch This Film,"This DVD Contains 2 versions of the same concert, The Original and The Director's Cut. When you first watch this DVD, Do NOT Select ""Play Movie"" from the title menu. Instead, select 'Bonus Materials' and Then ""Original Film.""The Original Is Certainly the the way to watch this concert. The Director's cut omits many visual effects from the original film, and shows different, but less interesting camera angles. The flow of the concert is also sabotaged by the forceful addition of 'behind the scenes' footage of the band creating The Dark Side Of The Moon in between songs in the Director's Cut. The Footage is valuable and interesting, but it ruins the 'feel' Of the concert."
1,DVD DOES NOT PLAY!!!!!,This DVD will not play on my American DVD player. I am very disappointed as it was very expensive and I really was looking forward to enjoying the performance.
3,Problems,I gave this as a gift. It wouldn't play in the standard DVD player or in a computer. It would only play in a Blu-Ray player even though this wasn't the Blu-Ray version.
3,"Great for the time, but by todays standards, not good.","You have to appreciate that it was 1970. No surround sound 5.1 no big light show. The concert is actually filmed live in an empty old roman empire stadium. The highlight was echos. THe rest is just OK. The dog, singing the blues is cool. Most of the interviews are very difficult to hear. I have an old tape copy, maybe the new DVD release has address this.In conclusion, its just OK, and probably only for serious floyd collectors. Pulse is the best. They need to release Delicate sound of thunder on DVD."
3,Director cut too much,"The music is great - I love the set list and their renditions. However, this director's cut is not your typical ""director's cut."" Typically a director's cut implies that there is more film footage, and that is true here with the extended interviews. However, a lot of the original footage is deleted and replaced by cheesy (to me) computer animation. And although the film as originally released is available on the DVD as an option, you can't watch it with the added interviews. So that's why I've given it 3 stars - the movie's fluidity is lost with all these abrasive cuts to modern computer animation. The coolest part of this movie, the slow pan toward the band in the amphitheater at the beginning, is completely lost by these edits."
5,Great era of a great band,"This is my favorite period in Pink Floyd history- and there really isn't one I don't like. So much of FLoyd's early material is bootlegged and/or expensive, it's such a blessing to have a high quality performance with some of my favorite songs recorded here. It is haunting and beautiful and they couldn't have chosen a better location for this concert and footage. I think they did a wonderful job editting it too for this Director's Cut."
1,Does not play in any DVD Player.,I received this video wife out of town going to watch concert. I could not get this DVD to work in any of my DVD playors. I think it might be a pirated DVD. Do not buy.
2,Boring and uneasy,"This DVD was not shot with the best interest of the band in mind. Most of the interviews did not really get to the meaning behind the group. The whole DVD was sloppy. Added to that, the DVD skipped many times during play."
2,"inspired parts of ""Spinal Tap""","When Johnny Rotten wore a T-shirt saying ""I hate Pink Floyd,"" this is probably the sort of fare he had in mind, not ""Arnold Lane"" or even ""Green is the Color."" This project boils all of the humor and verbal elegance out of a band that at its best unites cool melodies and compelling lyrics. But in this desolate if beautiful locale, the Floyd plays ponderous, predictable instrumentals that can't compete with contemporary efforts by Crimson or Yes, and two of these stodgy, interminable pieces make useless and unfunny references to murder in their titles. This is a slog fest musically with banal if well-shot visual poetry about volcanoes and ruins larded in. This obviously gave the makers of ""Spinal Tap"" grist for making fun of prog rock's prententious attempts to cathect to archetypal histories and energies while ironically making dull music."
1,Ladies and Gentlemen - The NICK MASON BAND!!!,"Apparently, Pink Floyd should have renamed themselves the Nick Mason Band because the director was certainly infatuated with the drummer!!! Occasionally we get a passing glance (and I mean ""passing"", because the camera moves right past them) at Gilmour, Waters, and Wright(about all we see of Wright is an extreme close up of his hands in the closing part of ""Echoes""). This was frustating, because the Meddle album was one of my favorites. Except for a brief Dark Side of the Moon session, this baby is for friends of the director only."
1,Awful,"I am a Pink Floyd fan. There are at least three phases to PF's evolution. This DVD focuses mostly on the earliest phase and my least favorite. I enjoy the latter two phases and the tail-end of the first phase. This DVD is not ""live"" in the sense of live music -- some of it is recorded outdoors and ""live"", but a real stretch of the term. If you are used to productions like PULSE, you will be sorely disappointed. However, if you are used to watching some poor VHS transfers of concerts, this is an improvement. To make it look better, though, many ""modern day"" items are mixed in. Having listened to PF albums hundreds of times, I was really disappointed with this."
1,Disgrace,"Being a large Pink Floyd fan, I went out and bought this dvd before renting it, that is the biggest mistake I ever made.I own all their other dvds, but this has hit in all time low in my whole dvd collection.First of all it is not even a concert (lame), it is a all day live recording in the ampitheater. The cut away images are realy stupid. There is no good guitar playing, just alot of noisey slide work. Mostly drums. Way to much high pitched noise. Most of the time it seemed as though were just trying to make as much noise as possible. In one song they even have a dog singing. This dvd does not sound anything like the Pink Floyd I love (including Syd). It is just a disgrace, echoes is the only half way decent thing."
1,PINK FLOYD LIVE at POMPEII,pink floyd live at Pompeii The DVD is not any good when I try to load it in player I get a message Error so I wasted my money on it.
2,"""Director's Cut"" raped the original","I used to own a copy of this before they made the ""Director's Cut"" and I loved it. Very artistic and well made. However, in this new version they have added video and photographs in places that interfere with the whole feel of the show. The slow zooms in and out at the beginning and end of the film are interrupted with added clips of space scenes. There is even some computer animation thrown in somewhere of what appears to be a model of what Pompeii may have looked like before its destruction. While all this is fine and dandy, I think they ruined the whole feel of the film by trying to modernize it. Masterpieces should be left alone! Buy the original, not the ""Director's Cut""."
2,Big Disappointment,"Firstly, given the scope and breadth of the Floyd's highly touted aural experience, why even bother to rerelease this without doing in 5.1. It's the industry standard, particularly among the classic-rock behemoth bands that are still actively making tons of money. Take the time and care and get it done. There's only one audio option and it sounds flat and bassy..The director's interview only scratches the surface of the process of filmmaking and how this shoot came to be. A commentary track would have been nice. And the subtitles only cover the interview banter and not the song lyrics, And I wasn't blown away by Maben's added footage. They are visually inconsistent, out of context and wholly detractory from the original atmosphere set by the original version."
5,floyd fans light up!,"The first time I saw this I was excited and found when viewing this film that not only do you get to see pink floyd displaying how extremely talented and creative they are, but get to see them as individuals struggling with the world around them, their relationships with each other and themselves. very cool rare footage of pink floyd during the recording of dark side the moon! They play live and oh man is it swweet!"
2,I DONT UNDERSTAND THE HIGH PRAISE OF OTHERS,"Nobody loves Pink Floyd more than I do. But to me this is one of those I might like to see on MTV or HBO once a year or so. Wish I would have saved my money. I was prepared to sit back and watch a live concert of sorts I guess. I used to watch my old Distant Thunder (VHS) over and over again, but since I dont have VHS anymore and cant seem to find it on DVD, I guess Im out of luck. I really miss that one. Anyway, this DVD Live at Pompeii, was just OK for me. It was interesting to see the band members in their younger years behind the scenes. But I dont care to really add this one to my DVD collection because it will only collect dust."
1,"does not play in u.s. blu ray/dvd players ,thus worthless junk","IF this product would play in a blu ray/dvd player in the u.s. , this would be a great deal, or maybe if I purchase a u.s. version then I could watch it anywhere...this is the second item like this and I don't think there will be a third..."
3,Director's Cut isn't always the best!,"This DVD is a five-star DVD because it includes the original ""Live at Pompeii"" video.Why I gave it 3 stars is because of the new release.Director's Cut doesn't always mean a better movie. And this is only one example of it.This includes all the songs that were in the original film.Still I don't know why the space-theme were included in the beginning (and the end) of the film.Since the ""Astronomy Domine"", the Floyd never had the space-theme in their songs.As a matter of fact, why re-do this once again?The original is far better than this one and I still believe that it will hold!"
1,In this day and age...,"There was no reason that this wasnt released in 5.1 channel sound. The picture quality is very crisp compared to the VHS tape Ive watched a million times...However directors cut or no I would strong recommend that you save your money boys and girls as I am sure that this will be Re-released in 5.1 as a "" super special"" platinum edition..yada yada yada version. Now keep in mind I have nothing but respect for the Floyd but Ive been waiting a Long time since I first heard that Pompeii was coming out and after the teasers of 5.1 classic Floyd on the Wall DVD I was really dissappointed to see the Plain and dull dolby stereo on the case, which was covered by the price sticker so I didnt know until I got it home. At least Pulse is coming soon :)"
5,A must for Floyd fans,"Great material. The singular important point is that Floyd was not quite yet Floyd...until Meddle was released. Insights and historical notes are tremendously interesting to we fans. Meddle was my first exposure to The Floyd, prior to the fantastic ""theme"" album, Dark Side. Meddle shows their range, and what Floyd really is. Gilmour and Roger Waters, though estranged, are still out there doing fantastic shows all over the planet. And both are healthy men, well into middle age, dispelling the myth that most rock stars are druggies, still or ever. This video is a must, trust me. You'll never walk alone."
5,What an experience!,"I saw this video before but not in total. Last weekend I watched it and I was impressed, again....What a great recordings! Great images, fantastic music :) and also the interviews between the songs are great. An absolute recommended dvd for the fans of psychedelica..."
2,Pink Floyd-Live in Pompeii,"The origanal was great I couldn't wait to get it on DVD and than it came out I gave my original away I bought the Dvd the directors cut.Well this brilliant director took the monolisa and cut her up through a bunch of modern crap threw it on top of it and made a real mess.I loved the original where you could watch Pink Floyd play and it was in order,before the Idiot director decided to cover all of the live playing with moon shots,sun spots and volcanoes erupting.The Directors cut is crap the Origanal was brilliant and I wish that I had my original VHS back."
2,"Great film, lousy release","I think by far the best version of this film was the 1974 theatrical release, which included scenes from the making of Dark Side of the Moon at Abbey Road Studios. The 2003 director's cut (the only version available on DVD) is a terribly jarring and distracting cut, with goof-ball space cartoons randomly tossed in continually throughout the original performance.The only saving grace is that it includes the original 1972 film under the ""features"" section. The director's cut is NOT worth watching.I can only hope and pray that they will eventually release this on blu-ray, and when they do, include a remastered version of both the 1972 and 1974 films."
2,For the Pink Floyd Purists Only,"The title is misleading since this is not a live concert with an audience. The band playing in an empty outdoor stadium in the Pompei ampitheater. There are weird video snipits of lava bubbling and band members running thru wierd landscapes.(one intresting interview with the band)In terms of the music on this DVD, you'll hear the band's experimentation with trance-like sound scapes but very little structured songs or dicernible meolodies. I suppose this DVD would be a must have for the Pink Floyd purist, but it' not my thing."
5,this is pure post sid floyd at it's best,"i saw this video in 1985 or six for the first time and it was good. i saw it in 1987, compliments of purple capped mushrooms and i would give it 5 stars plus. i saw it again on a big screen in 1990 with white blotter and it freaked me out. now that i am older amd somewhat wiser i still give it a super thumbs up not just for the memories of old, but the the floyd of old is brilliant and mystical; quite frankly , intersteller."
5,Finally re-released on DVD!! A must have!!,"If you are a pink floyd fan, then this a must have especially for the behind the scenes during the making of darkside of the moon. I have watched my VHS copy hundreds of times and kept waiting for a DVD version to come out. This DVD is definitely a must buy for anyone who appreciates pink floyd, you won't be dissapointed!!"
2,"FINALLY ! , i guess......","20 bucks, there had to be a catch....... 4% PAL to NTSC speed up .... ridiculous (not neccessarily chipmunk floyd but extremely annoying to any one sensitive to pitch and tempo......better than the vhs only in the sense, that it won't wear out thru multiple viewings, and the mix is certainly better..........i guess remixing the music from the original multitracks and transfering at the CORRECT speed (for NTSC ) was too much....... trouble ? bottom line. Floyd deserve to be remembered better than this.......buyer beware !"
5,awesome,It is the best Pink Floyd experience I have ever had. Just sit back and be thoroughly entertained.
3,"not vintage rich, but good arrangements and great band ...","This is not classic Buddy Rich. It is a rock/soul big band album with little smokin' jazz as B.R. is known for. However the arrangements are good and the band is great as Buddy's bands always were. Great solos and ensemble playing make the album really pretty good as long as you're not expecting ""West Side Story"" or ""Channel One Suite"" This is another of Buddy's live recordings on the World Pacific Jazz label, which in my opinion was his greatest recorded body of work. This isn't one of his classics, but necessary for the true Buddy Rich Big Band fan."
5,Access to important ideas,"There are two kinds of books that make you feel smart. The first kind is so laughably awful that you put it down thinking ""I'm WAY smarter than that guy."" The second, and better, kind is a book that leaves you with a couple dozen exciting new ideas whizzing around your head, firing your imagination and inspiring thoughts you would never otherwise have had. This book is the second kind. With solidly-documented ideas and examples drawn from a hundred sources, Brand demonstrates that our relationship to time, and the models we use to think about it, are no longer useful and need to be changed. The new models for thinking about it are included at no charge."
5,Take Some Time With This One!,"A great book -- thought-provoking, frightening, inspiring. The need for a longer term view on life is widely accepted, but never implemented. This forces such a broadening of the view that we're forced to consider a seven generation view easily implementable. Take some time and cogitate on this one!"
2,hard to read 'clock after reading loren eiseley,"after quickly looking over a copy of the clock of the long view this evening i quickly realized that i had read haunting literary versions of 'similar conceptual landscapes' in Loren Eiseley's books: The Immense Journey; Night Country ... . it would be hard for me to sit and read 'clock after reading and rereading many of Eiseley's books and especially, to me, his most haunting essay of all: 'instruments of darkness' in night country."
3,Adorable but sheds like crazy,I bought this for my son who played with a skunk puppet at an information center when we went up to Hurricane Ridge in WA to go hiking. He had so much fun with it that I had to get him one to play with at home. This one is smaller than the one we saw at the information center but my son still loves it. The only issue we've had with it so far is that is sheds quite a bit. My son likes to keep it by his bed and even he commented on all the fur coming out the first time he played with it. I may try to run a vacuum hose over it to see it that will help.
5,Great book on the beginning of the first world war,An excellent book on how the first world war began in Europe and the events and battles of the first years of the war.
4,The Secret Diary of Anne Boleyn,"good book, has the feel of an actual historical, non-fiction book. Recommend it for anyone interested in Henry the 8th history, just for a fun diversion."
1,Interesting premise that fails to deliver,"Even though the author claims to be a student of Tudor England's history, the book's many inaccuracies and her portrayal of Anne lead me to believe that her knowledge of this era is, at best, superficial.The novel is only romance pulp disquised as historical fiction. Mildly entertaining and not much more."
2,Less than impressed,"This was a selection for my book club, and it was a struggle to read it. It was a bodice-ripper cleverly disguised as historical fiction, and tended to bog down in places with too much information about the activities of too many characters, without any background information regarding their motivations. There are other fictional books on the same subject that do a much better job."
2,A Suffering Bodice-ripper,"Historical fiction this is not. Historical fiction comes from folks like Mary Renault, in my opinion. But if your definition of historical fiction includes romance novel authors such as diana gabaldon, then perhaps, this, too is historical fiction. These days the label ""historical fiction"" seems to be tossed about to enhance the dignity of low-brow sex-thrillers. This is a syrupy fantasy novel that falls flat even in the romantic sequences that are the focus of the book. Wooden characters and equally stiff interactions. Yes, this is a harsh criticism and it's my true appraisal of the book. Without negative or luke-warm reviews such as this and others here, we'd have a collection of 5-star reviews where apparently every book on Amazon was ""the best I've ever read!"" Not too informative, eh? I read these reviews before I purchase books or check-out from library. Hence, it's nice to see honest critiques of books as opposed to hyberbole. My recommendation is to skip this book."
1,Sorely Disappointed,"I love fiction and nonfiction books about Queen Elizabeth, Mary Queen of Scots, and their century. But this was a real disappointment. It didn't offer any new understanding of the time period or of Elizabeth or Anne's characters. The love scenes were awkward and embarrasing. They seemed gratuitous and out of place. Thank goodness there are other good books about this period out there. Check out Alison Weir, Reay Tannahill or Patricia Finney for good books set in 16th century England."
2,Disappointing bodice-ripper lacks Fabio on the cover,"This poor book has a wonderful premise but it turns out to be standard romance pulp. The author seems unable to discard a single notecard so the research ends up sounding like a termpaper for ""Intro to Tudor England."" The characters are flat, save for perky alabaster bosoms everywhere you turn. Anne Boleyn's diary is totally unconvincing with its polished 2000 word entries, pages of perfectly remembered dialog, and a prescience that would put Nostradamus into a jealous funk. Elizabeth rides around saving England and the Reformation and setting her older and wiser advisors straight like Batgirl bailing out Gotham and bawling out Commissioner Gordon. Barbara Cartland has done this kind of stuff hundreds of times without the phony erudition."
3,"It's ok. Not bad, not great.","I thought this book as very slow in parts. The approach of a ""diary"" I thought was not all that great. Time jumped sometimes 6 months to a year between ""entries"". I understand that it would be even less interesting if the author had put more in there but sometimes I felt that if I didn't already know the story of Henry VIII/Anne Boleyn/Queen Elizabeth I would be lost. What was interesting to me was the idea that Anne Boleyn was not a manipulating person, that instead she was just strolling along and all of a sudden the King wanted her, without her doing anything. I think it's unlikely true but it was an intersting take on the situation.If you love the era, it's something to fill time, but I would not rush out to read it. It's ok. Not bad, not great."
3,"A good, light, weekend read","The book kept my interest and I liked the different plot - the ""communication"" between Anne and Elizabeth. However, I didn't think it rang true, because from all I've read of the Great Harry he was nothing like the wimpy guy in this story."
3,A Good Romp!,"Robin Maxwell's book, The Secret Diary of Anne Boleyn: A Novel, was well written. Maxwell's interesting read was a blend of female introspection, historical ""facts"" and a modern look into a 16th century world. This book is not to be taken as the difinitive historical account of its characters but as a creative approach at understanding and relishing a time long gone. No, it is not the most accurate book written about the Tudor tristes and scandals; but nor does the author present the book as such. To enjoy this book suspend your disbelief and take a leap into one of the most ""romantic"" romps in history."
1,Trite and unhistorical account of Tudor England,"The only thing(s) sillier than this novel are the reviews praising it. It is no more faithful to the historical record than the novels of Jean Plaidy. As an academic who specializes in the field, I urge serious students of Tudor England to read a book that is faithful to the language and spirit of the age: Maria Perry, _Word of a Prince: A life of Elizabeth I from contemporary documents_. If you must read historical fiction, then try Patricai Finney, _Firedrake's Eye_. It is a superior effort, and much to be preferred over this bodice-ripper."
1,Absolutely horrible and disappointing,"As stated in my title, this book was absolutely horrible and disappointing. I can't say much for the factual accuracy of events, however, the style of writing of this book was an injustice to the subject matteres of Queen Elizabeth and Anne Boyeln. Myself and other avid readers agreed that the book was confusing on referencing the past or the present. This book also had the same stylistics of trashy romance novels, quickly put together for a fast sale. Some of the passionate references were irrelevant to establishing the mood or characters. Don't waste your time or money on this book."
2,Wish I'd read the reviews first.,"Painful said it all. I got to page four and quit - sorely disappointed. I am becoming an addict for the royals, actually biographies in general. And I enjoy a story-telling as much as anyone else. But it was unnecessary to promote gratuitous sex, and more especially to do so at such an early turn. I was looking forward to reading the book after I had read that the writer had spent twelve years researching, etc. Those years and that effort cannot be recovered: the product sadly doesn't reflect the real cost of the author's work."
1,Abominal,This book is outrageous and not in a good way. I put it down only just a way into the second chapter. I found [certain] scenes offensive and totally unescessary. I don't recommend this to anyone at all. ... Stay away from this.
4,Great book from Anne's point of view,"unfortunately, I never could get into the portions regarding Elizabeth and her love life so I ended up skipping those and reading only the diary portions. The diary brings to life the humiliation, anger, fear and lack of love Anne must have felt for Henry. To reach the very heights of happiness and sink quite low as if on a roller coaster must be very scary indeed."
1,"""History"" in a Harlequin Romance format","If Barbara Cartland is your idea of a great novelist, please, buy this book. All other individuals with any vague knowledge of the Tudor family will find this book painful. It reeks of bad dime-store romance prose. Search for a history book instead. ANY history book on the Tudors will suffice. It will be far more interesting and much less irritating."
2,Disappointing,"I am a great fan of this period of history and a great admirer of Anne, but this book does not live up to it's promise. It is a fair enough read, but towards the end I found the endless angst a little grinding. I also found the ending and the way it attempts to relate to Elizabeth's reign quite unconvincing."
2,Surprisingly flat for a book focused on sex and religion,"This book is a very traditional treatment of Tudor history. No social context, no real understanding of the politics or restraints women like Anne lived within. The author makes Anne the central figure -- the reformation in England occurs at her instigation. While trying to correct the traditional oversight of female figures in Tudor history, the author overcompensates by making Anne the absolute center. While this is a diary, and such a focus is therefore understandable, the book does not read as such, but as a flat recounting of events."
3,From the back cover,"They had shared a beautiful affair.Then Briony had learned the shattering truth. Although she had been deeply in love with Kieron, a reporter then, he had wanted her only for a newspaper scoop. It was painfully ironic to Briony that his calculated lovemaking should have resulted in such a beautiful baby boy...It was no less ironic that Kieron Blake should now be Briony's new boss at the Daily Globe.One look at little Nicky told him the truth - and set them on a collision course. Either Briony married him or took his son away!"
3,The Illustrated Rumi -Poet of the Soul,It was a good quality previously owned book. Details on website for book were not that detailed... it did not say that book had a hand written gift message on the front 2nd page - I bought it to gift a freiend and so have to figure out how best to remove this hand written message..
1,complete guide to sporting collectibles,"First of all the word complete does not belong on the cover of this book. I think that this book is a perfect example of someone trying to do everything but ends up not doing anything well. There are books dedicated to subjects such as guns, knives and decoys, which could have been left out of this book. I think chapter 14 is a good example this chapter tries to cover cartridges, shotshells,and powder cans and kegs. There no descriptions, or pictures and it barely touches on each subject. If i had to describe this book in one word it would be disappointing, I would not recommend this book to anyone."
2,Good flow wack beats...,"This CD sounds like it was made on my little sisters keyboard. Kaze can flow, I'll give him that, but what about the beats man?!?!?! THE BEATS!!!! Save your cash for some Little Brother or somethin', if your into the NC scene."
5,My favorite Soundtrack,"This movie is very australian, which I find funny, but can see why others wouldn't. What i like to tout about this movie best is the soundtrack. Every song has a great groove, and uniqueness that still stands up, I believe to todays standards. Just about every song on the CD I still listen to on a repeated basis at least once every two months or so after all these years. If you didn't care for the movie, i get it, but give the soundtrack a listen, it is one of the best, there has been. I looked in to the bands that do the songs and did't really care for whatever else they had going, seems the best they all had were put here. ""Dumb Things"" and ""I hear a motion"" and ""Great Southern Land"" were the toppers, but it's still too close to call. I loved 'em every one( to quote Ronnie Milsap, who was not an influence on this CD)."
1,PC Card Hardware Review,"If you are trying to design a PC card to run under windows, this handbook provides a reasonable hardware overview, but is of little or no use as far as software development. The book refers the reader to the Microsoft DDK for software help. A major portion of the book also lists commercially available PC cards and the drivers for them, but this is of little use to someone trying to design PC Card software. It is also likely to be quickly outdated. This book would be better titled ""PC Card Hardware Review""."
3,"Good, but not as good as original.","While I enjoyed the original Like Mike, I figured Like Mike 2 would be just as good, but surprisingly was let down. Although it is still cute, with many similarities to the original, it clearly wasn't as good. If you're thinking of buying this movie because the original Like Mike was so good, save your money, because you'll be disappointed."
3,Good fun for the young basketball lovers,"My boys, ages 4 and 6, really enjoyed the movie. They're really into basketball right now and liked all of the ""moves"" the main character was able to achieve wearing his ""special shoes""."
2,Don't pay for this sequel!!!,If you must see this wait until it is a freebie. The first Like Mike was an enjoyable movie. My 11 year old nephew rents movies when visiting and he lost interest in the movie halfway through it.
4,Secrets Behind A Small Town,"King's Row starts off with a view of a sign that announces that the town of King's Row is a great place to live and have a family. The rest of the movie shows you just how untrue that sign was. The film turns the romantic view of life in a small town upside down, exposing a lot of vices and prejudices. The performances are a mixed bag. Ann Sheridan gives one of her best performances as the girl from the wrong side of the tracks (literally), and Ronald Reagan surprises with an effective job as the victim of a sadistic doctor. But Robert Cummings is sometimes laughable as the very idealistic young doctor and Betty Field is over the top as his troubled girlfriend. The supporting cast is generally fine, with an especially fine performance by Nancy Coleman, who should have become a star but didn't. The movie is both dramatic and entertaining, and if you like stories about small towns like I do, then don't miss this one. It's an eye-opener!"
3,Satisfied,"The movie kept stopping and would not start again. Instead of returning ,I was told to keep andit would be credited to my charge card. I am satisfied, but I don't have a movie that playsJohnel casey"
2,creaky soap opera,"Maybe Vincent Minnelli could have helped this movie. At least he would have given the movie some style, and energy. The first half of the movie is similar to GREAT EXPECTATIONS, though David Lean's movie is a lot better. The first half drags; the second half is a bit better.The cast, especially Ronald Reagan, seems even more out of place than James Cagney in THE OKLAHOMA KID. The acting brings to mind the deliberately bad acting for the silent movie scenes in SINGING IN THE RAIN.And then there's the same bit of music played through out the movie. And the characters give high minded speeches or talk in flowery nonsense, or say ""get a hold of yourself, kid"" for victorian times.william cameron menzies worked on this and GONE WITH THE WIND---a couple minutes of exteriors in the first half seem like GONE WITH THE WIND shots.It's nice that small town, olde time, america is shown as a sham, but it's not enough to make this movie work."
5,You'll want to watch it over and over...,"After watching this movie, I had to go find my husband.He asked, ""was the movie good?"" and then glanced at my face and said, ""the movie was very good!"" I don't know if it was the smile or the tears that gave him the clue, but what a super way to spend the evening! Ronald Reagan was one sexy guy, and the story really hit home that even in 1900, even in small town America, suicide, murder, sadistic doctors, scandalous women, overbearing fathers, and financial woes existed. Definitely not a light love story as the cover would make you believe.By the way, don't blink... Natalie Wood is there for a quiet moment near the beginning."
1,Not even a warm pink.,"There just didn't seem to be any substance to this story. Neither character had any idea of what romance is and after skimming through the first few ""erotic"" scenes with a yawn. I didn't feel any emotion or depth to Chloe and Rocco's love scenes. The whole story revolved around sex and that definitely wasn't enough to save the nonexistent plot. The climax just never seemed to happen."
3,I am a huge fan of Susan's...,"but this book really did not keep me interested as last years Blonde Heat did. Chloe is a ""pink"" headed graphic artist and Rocco works in the marketing field. Both meet in an elevator and it is instant lust, which I felt mostly on Chloe's part. Both are parked in the same garage and when Chloe's car doesn't start, Rocco offers to drive her home and Chloe offers him a ""night cap"" which Rocco unquestiongly takes her up on. From there on it is mindless sex without much romance at all. Rocco is trying to get rid of the scheming Amy who wants to marry him and Chloe is bitter that she cannot have Rocco again after one weekend of sex. I just did not feel the love ""vibes"" or chemistry between Chloe and Rocco as a couple. I hope Susan's next novel will be better because I really look forward to her books. Lately it seems she is becoming hit and miss, with this book falling under the miss category."
3,Good book!,"I bought this book years ago, and still enjoy reading it! I'm looking forward to reading more from this author. Although the pink hair is kind of silly :)"
2,Not that great,"Ok, it has great sex scenes and all that. But the plot and story line are so stupid, its pretty much non existant. Odd, being that SJ is normally awesome. Skip this one."
2,1/2* Cool off,"Susan Johnson's sophomore take on chick literature turns out disappointingly cliche with a lack of emotional core in both of her protagonists, web-designer Chloe Chisolm and aspiring entrepreneur Rocco Vinelli. Johnson's trademark sensual scenes burn and smolder but do not quite attain the erotic virtuosity as in her historical novels like Sinful and Brazen. Chloe, along with her friends, ponder whether their happy ending exists when relationships go turbulent. The most devastating of all is when Chloe had a one-night stand with Rocco and discovers later that he is ""engaged"" to a malicious, wilful brat Amy whose father is the determining factor to his success in his nascent business operations. Clearly unfocused, Johnson adds in dramatic antics and a new lover boy to spice things up. Unfortunately, Hot Pink doesn't live up to its hype."
5,Steamy Sex Scenes...yes please!,Sure its a very weak plot line involving instant attraction and first date sex (if you can call it a date) this book was super hot a perfect read before a hot date or home alone in bed. Note:Do'nt read this book in a public setting....I guarantee you'll blush.
2,Blah.. thats all I can say....,"Okay, so I read reviews of the book and how it wasn't her usual flair of erotic and plot book. But I just couldn't listen... I got the book and THEY WERE RIGHT!!!!!!!!! There was like two sex scenes that were okay and thats putting it mildly. The plot completely stunk. If you like the author, then by all means, get the book and add it to your collection. However, if you want a good book with a good plot mixed with eroticism look at her earlier books. For example, Outlaw, Tempting, Sinful, Siezed by love, Pure Sin, Brazen, Wicked or Taboo. You won't be disappointed."
1,Missions? I think not.,"This was a tedious and frustrating read. Bradshaw's arguments were poorly developed and poorly supported (if at all).Aside from a plethora of statements that made the reader wonder what version of the Bible he was using, Bradshaw presented a concept of missions that left God in the background. If his ideas were the standard, missions would be nothing more than a cross cultural relief effort carried out by an elite few with a highly specific education in conducting foreign relations and interpreting cultural narratives. This is not missions. Missions is about God working his power through ordinary, broken people to show his love and his truth to people of all nations regardless of cultural barriers. God is the change agent and people are one medium through which change occurs, not the other way around."
3,"This cd is going to put a ""song in your heart""",What a pleasant surprise this cd has been. It is almost too good to be true. The orchestra performs these songs in a very romantic and relaxing manner. Most of these songs are among my favorites.There were a few unpleasant arrangements among these selections. For the most part this is a cd that most will want to own. This cd will put a huge smile on your face and a lot of love iln your heart. It will make you want to dance.I Would Like To Recommend This Cd
2,Disappointed,Disappointed that my order was cancelled with no reason given. Won't order from them again
4,Warner Signature Collections -- well worth the $$$,"Warner does another stand-up job with the Ronald Reagan Signature Collection. Some of these films are well known and a couple of them are not, making it a great collection worthy of a spot in any serious DVD collection.And -- no Bedtime for Bonzo in sight! (Mainly because it's a Universal title, but this set does a great job in highlighting the former Commander in Chief's Hollywood career)."
4,Great Movies,"I am an old movie buff, will not watch anything rated above a PG rating,I love collecting the oldies, have favorite leading stars, Doris Day, Cary Grant, Debbie Reynolds, James Garner, Gary Cooper (the collection now offered does not have of my favorite movies.) Clarke Gable, Audrey Hepburn, Lucille Ball to name a few. Thanks Amazon for being so prompt on your deliveries, and the prices are great.I would love to purchase ""Magnificient Obsession"" w/Jane Wyman and ""Bundle of Joy"" staring Debbie Reynolds please notify me if these become available. I had been waiting for ""The Winning Team to be released so when the package was offered I jumped on it. Thanks again for being so prompt and great prices. Television has gotten to where it is not fit to watch, so I collect old movies for the decency and enjoy watching them. this may not be the kind of review you were looking for but, I just wanted to thank you.Barbara Simanovich"
5,AWESOME COLLECTION!,I own this set and I am very satisfied with it. I had never seen any ofthese wonderful movies and I am very glad that I was able to get this set.I am a Ronald Reagan fan (as an actor and politician) and I am pleased to be able to recommend this collection. I consider it a collector's item.
1,Out of balance,"I was really happy to find this item as I needed it for a tool I was building. Unfortuntely, the unit was out of balance and would not spin true. Was very frustrating. I tried to find a way to correct it, but it was not use. The product failed totally."
2,"This book didn't work for me, but it may for you.","This book didn't work for me, but it may for you. I'm the type for whom dense prose works very well, so the scatter-shot layout was really hard for me to follow. If you're a classic J. Random Hacker type, this book probably won't work for you either."
5,Should be a standard book for Computer Science majors,This is a great book and very easy to read/understand.
5,Excellant Book even if you are not a Java developer,"This book was recommended by a friend. When I got the book and started to look at it I was afraid I had just wasted my money. The style of the book is so different from other technical books I have read, I thought I would not be able to read this one. This was not true. The book is really easy to read and I found the style perfect for this topic. I can't say enough good things about this book. I can say that I am a C# developer and I was totally able to relate to 99% of all the examples in this book. If anything this book will help you understand how similar the to languages and their frameworks are similar."
3,A little bit too talkative,"An interesting and deep analysis of different patterns but a little bit too verbose / talkative. But I guess it is for educational reasons. But I must admit that I got tired of it later in the book and skipped the 'interviews', 'chats' and I found the 'master' and 'grasshopper' chat a little silly.But I did learn some new stuff about patterns and corrected some things that I had misunderstood."
4,Great presentation,"This book gives the same concepts as many other books. But, what makes this book stand out in the crowd is the presentation style. The concepts I learn from Head First series books stick in my mind forever. Must read for learning design patterns, without slipping into sleep :-)"
1,Too many words about nothing; too repetative,"If you like reading 20 pages that could be explained in 2, you may like it.(And if you value books by the # of pages and not the amount of actual info..)I just lose focus if I have to read more than think. And childish examples with pictures don't do it for me... If you are looking for a solid, compact and straight-to-the point book on design patterns, where each page matters, that's definitely not the one."
5,Good Book and Easy Reading,"This book takes a novel approach to the topic of design patterns and presents it in a manner which is anything but boring. The bottom line: it's a well written book and makes digesting this topic interesting.I recommend it for anyone who wants to learn more about design patterns.Although it is written with Java in mind, if you have an understanding of basic OOP programming then this book should make sense to you. There are also resources available online that have translated the examples into [...]."
5,"Engaging, plenty of pictures, retained knowledge.","I purchased this book after reading some chapters of the Head First: Object Oriented Analysis and Design book. I've always wanted to learn more about patterns. I have one of the definitive books on patterns but it is had to grasp. Although that books provides examples of the patterns with certain problems/solutions, it does a poor job of diagramming the thought process. Head First does a great job of adding to the knowledge foundation to start thinking about why a pattern is necessary, and why it works. I've already used two of the patterns as I was learning them.The downside to this book is that it does not have as much coverage in the patterns. Other books are needed to supplement it. However, the knowledge retained is invaluable."
5,Excellent book on design patterns,"This is an excellent book on design patterns. The book really helps to understand various design patterns, oo principles. I would definitely recommend this book. A must read."
4,Good introduction but poor in examples,This is a good book for you if you don't have much experience in Design Patterns. It approaches the theme by introducting the basic concepts and how to apply them in Java language. The only critic I have is that this book like many others should come with practical examples. That's why I didn't give it 5 stars.
2,Don't buy this,"This book is neither an introductory book nor an advanced one. Authors of this book have given thier own interpretations of the design patterns originally defined by GOF book. I bought GOF book several years ago and never got interested to read it because of the way they presented their material so dry. So I bought this book thinking that this would atleast give me some clue. Instead it made things worse. So I opened GOF again started reading and realized that it should have been studied rather than read. So I started a study group with my co workers. Well, it worked really well. I won't say I mastered all the patterns but now I know what those GOF folks are talking about. After understanding those patterns, I started hating this book more. So my recommendation is not to buy this one."
5,Good book to start with,Head first design pattersn is a very good books to learn design patterns. I liked the way of presentation and explanation.I liked the exercises at the end of each chapter.
5,the rigth way to learn,"This book has and will transfor the way publishing and learning should be. A brilliant way to explain complicated topics.A must read for all designers, architects and developers..."
5,Great book especially for beginners!!!!,"I have skimmed through a lot of books related to design patterns, and this is the best beginner book I have found so far. It is fun to read, and easy to understand, More importantly, unlike many other design pattern books which use the same examples over and over again ('mimic' Gang of Four classic Design Pattern book's examples), this book uses different examples that give you a better understanding about how each design pattern can be used. Of course, as described in the book, this is not a reference book or book for guru, because it focuses on more popular patterns, but it does touch on the rest of patterns that are less used, which gives you a good head start. Another good thing about this book is, it also describes the ""relationship"" between one pattern and another, and how they can be used together (although more would be nice). Anyhow, if you want to learn Design Pattern, this will be a good start!!!!"
3,Only for C# and maybe Java developers,"I picked-up this book understanding that it used C# and Java for examples, yet under the impression that the concepts would easily generalize to the world of C++ (which C# and Java are descended from). I find that this is not the case, as not only does class inheritance work dramatically differently in these languages as compared to C++, the explanations of the design patterns are written in such a manner as to be incompatible with any other language. This is not useful as a general guide to design patterns, and due to the style of writing it strikes me as not very useful as a reference once aware of the fundamentals of the design patterns. This is a sort of read-once and throw away sort of book. Not my cup of tea."
1,Ouch!,"I really can't think of anything good to say about this book. It is, hands-down, the most disappointing technical book I have ever bought (and I buy an obscene amount of them).To be fair, I don't think it purports to be a reference. But I'm not sure what it *is* good for. I've picked it up a number of times since I bought it, but so far, I have always simply put it back on the shelf in exasperation. It's vaguely reminiscent of some kind of 3rd grade workbook you might have used. I don't necessarily hold that against its producers, but if you haven't actually seen the content, be advised.I don't know how typical it is of the series, but I don't see me buying another Head First book unless I have the chance to examine it beforehand (which, I suppose, I should have done prior to buying this one)."
1,Ergh,"Unfortunately I can't give this zero stars.I bought the book on the strength of the Amazon reviews. I'd expected a ""lighter"" style. However, I didn't expect it to be like a history book for 13 year-old school kids, desperately trying to try to make the subject ""interesting"". Hardly any paragraphs over 100 words lest the audience's attention span be exceeded. If I'd wanted a comedy book, I'd have bought one. The only way that it could have been worse would have been to make it a ""pop-up"" book. For me this is a book for people that have not acquired the skill of reading by regularly reading journals, magazines and books.This book was such a disappointment that it's the only one that I've ever returned to Amazon (out of over 300 - that puts it below the bottom 0.3% of my rating)."
5,Head First Design Patterns,"The best humor book I read ever! I'm not kidding, you will smile in every page! And easy learn hard topics."
5,clear but not elementary,Very good for current software developers and goes well alongside design patterns 2nd edition. It is good to read cover to cover once since each pattern builds on the previous but you can read specific chapters as well.
4,Essential for understanding the GoF patterns practically,I have often found that the GoF book is dry even though the content is vital for all software engineers to be aware of. The head first book really makes the patterns more understandable. I recommend this book to start to fully understand the most important patterns and have the GoF book around as a quick reference.
4,Nice presentation of design patterns,"I have this book and the ""Gang of Four"" (Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software) and this one is definitely more enjoyable to read. The examples are presented with real-life scenarios that are easy to understand. The GoF book is more of a dry textbook, and probably makes a better reference to go back to after studying. The Head First series has a much better flow without being too fluffy. The examples build on each other and make sense for the most part, but sometimes they try to model more familiar non-programming scenarios (e.g. remote control, waitress) rather than programs that you would normally see these patterns being used in. That makes it easier to understand, but harder to put to good use. Still, a good book."
5,Very easy to read and understand,Design Patterns is a rather dry subject. This book however presents the concepts with very good real world examples in easy to understand terms.
5,Kindle Edition is not functional,"The Kindle edition for this book is incompatible with a regular Kindle. You can read it on iPad, but it's just page images so it's really hard to read. Amazon refunded my money with a push of a button, so no problem there. Also, the book is excellent. I have already read the paper based version of this. If you want to learn GOF patterns, I highly recommend this book."
5,Super Series,The entire Head First series is the best thing to come along in a long time. This book is no exception. Thank you Head First authors!
4,Get past the cover art and its a great book,"The cover art is a turn off, and the style of the book is a litle childish, but get past this and it explains design patterns in with simple clarity. The GangOfFour book may have collected these patterns originally, but this book sets the gold standard so far on explaining them."
2,Strictly for a Java Man-Child,"If you're a java man-child with ADD, looking to read a pretty cartoon book with plenty of personified design patterns, this book is for you!Seriously, this book gives me a headache. At the end of one of the first chapters, there is a stupid crossword puzzle with buzz words from the chapter. If you really hate the usual programming book, and need this sort of thing to stay interested, this book is definitely for you, but if you are that sort of person, I also wouldn't recommend programming.To it's credit, it does have a lot of detailed design patterns, but there was no way I could sit through reading this. If you just did ""Hello World"" in java, then you might use this to kick-start your programming, but I could not see anyone else reading this."
2,Bad choice for professional developers,"At first I was digging this book, towards the middle I ripped it up into shreads (just like the OOA/D book by head first) and threw it away. As a matter of fact, it's sitting in my trash can as I'm writing this. If you're looking for a book explaining design patterns, like many of the cartoons within it, this book's a joke. They could have reduced this book to a fifth of it's size. Instead, you get a load of childish and repetitive fluff. You'll feel like you're getting introduced to design patterns by the dumb jocks who used to beat you up in high school. For goodness sake, we're software engineers not cheerleaders. People, get a real book."
1,Too much fluff,"I bought the book on the strength of the Amazon reviews.Unfortunately, the book is written to the level of a child ... or perhaps to someone who has ADHD. I found the style very tedious, pompous, and excessively expressive.This is quite possible the worst book I've ever purchased."
2,"Patronising, but readable","This book is a bit of a mixed bag; there are some good examples in it and it is easy to understand, but you do have to wade through a huge amount of rubbish to find the useful information. I'd say that about 80% of this book is filler and you can skip it, the problem with that of course is that you get into the habit of skipping so much that you might end up missing the few things of value. The exercises are very very basic, so if you have been programming for any length of time you will find them quite insulting. Actually I found most of the book quite insulting.It is very java centric, so they make quite a lot of reference to the java api, but if you know another OO language well this isn't really a problem. For all my griping I would say that it is worth a look if you don't know anything about design patterns because pretty quickly you will get the idea that most of ""design patterns"" is about stating the obvious."
1,"As another reviewer put it: ""tedious""","If you enjoy being treated like a 5 year old, you'll love this book. They take 50 pages of goofy cartoons and scenarios to demonstrate patterns that could be explained in 10 pages. I kept thinking to myself, ""Get to the point!"" It's like that windbag professor you had in college who taught to the lowest common denominator of the class.It also would have been nice if they had code examples in languages other than Java. I'd love to see how functional programming could use the patterns."
3,Experienced programmers need not apply.,"Received this book as a part of a mandated OO design patterns class for a fortune top 15 company. It is great if you never payed attention in school, you never programmed before, or you are a ""mathematically challenged"" person who is in this field just for a paycheck. Personally I found it completely worthless as it just reiterates SDLC basics mixed with common sense. Could be summed up in less than 50 pages not 600. Not good for, nor meant to be used as a reference book. More akin to a pop-up book for developers."
1,Kindle Edition Doesn't Work on the Kindle,"You'd think something dubbed ""Kindle Edition"" would work on a Kindle? Guess again. This should be re-branded ""Electronic Edition"" as I have a Kindle Touch running the latest software and if you try to open this book on it you get ""This item is not compatible with this device.""It does work on Kindle for Mac and PC.It does not work with Kindle for iPhone."
5,Easy to read,Great starter book on Design Patterns. I read this as a beginning Java developer and I think it was a much better place to start than the Gang of Four.I'd recommend for beginners.
5,Simple and Fun,"This book makes learning design patterns fun. I have read code that mentions Factory, Repository, and Proxy, but I didn't understand what these concepts meant. Starting out with the official Gang of Four book sounded intimidating. This book offered a perfect way to learn the basics of these patterns. The examples were easy to understand. I really enjoyed reading this book."
4,Head First Design Patterns,Very good book with a very good concept. It takes your hand and follow you in understanding some important programming patterns which will make your life easier.
5,a must for writers of the period or people wanting a source,"This book is just what it says, a listing of Scottish Historical Documents starting with Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the early 8th Century and moving up to 1707 with the Articles of Union. All Major Documents are included, such as the Letter of Barons of Scotland to Pope John XXII in 1320 - known more commonly as the Declaration of Arbroath, to even the lesser known Statues of Iona in 1609.Over 240 documents are dealt with, from all aspects of Scots' History, covering education, settles of succession, the poor acts, Kirk matters, land tenure, crown rentals, and constitutional changes. Note are kept brief.So people wanting to know more of Scotland's history and without access to ancient documents, or writers of Scottish fiction, this book is a MUST."
4,Victorian age at its best,"I read this book, here in Brazil.I found it on an internet site, some years ago.Samuel Baker, one of the biggest explores of Africa, married with a former slave, went to Africa, during XIX Century.His exploration of Africa is the subject of this book.He was complete sincere.Mosquitoes, deseases, slavery, animals,etc. are described in this book."
3,Good (but disturbing to me) look into Africa in times past.,I tried VERY hard to take this book in it's context----- a truthful account of what was considered 'normal' at that time in Africa------the wanton slaughter of big game plus the attitude shown towards the native population.For people who can read the book as history then it's a fair account. I just couldn't and had to stop part way through.
3,"Excellent construction, baggy, fussy.","I use 38W30L pants and, according to the size chart, got the XL short. Length is ok, thanks to the repositionable kee protectors, albeit a wee bit long. The pants are quite baggy. I can use them with the warmers in over jeans and still feel quite baggy. The waist is OK tho. Once on, they are quite comfortable but the miriad zippers and velcro closures, while convenient, can be overwhelming. Going to the bathroom is a patient maneuver. Pockets are convenient and well sized. Complñetely waterproof; you can stand in a carwash and come out dry inside."
4,I'm Going to Remake this...,"Well, being a HUGE Kinks fan I bought this as a X'mas present for myself. I owned the soundtrack first and loved all of the music on it, so I was a bit surprised to find out that most of the music was written for porn scenes in the movie! Still, the music is EXCELLENT and the movie is a funny cult classic also. They don't make movies like this anymore.....I can see why. Rent it before you buy it. If you're a Kinks fan, just go ahead and buy it. Ray Davies has said that it's his favorite film of all time!"
2,Snap-on tool?,"Here's a royal turkey (that is, a bad movie made in Britain) that defies the Lenny Maltin-esque idea that EVERYTHING from 'cross the pond is pure gold.The best thing one can say about PERCY (1971), besides its having Denholm Elliott in the cast, is that the soundtrack album contains THIRTEEN (count 'em) Kinks songs, including that massive hit, ""Lola."" Unfortunately, these tunes play during moments of soft pórn, which is frequent.What a cringe-inducing story!This guy loses his johnson in an accident and becomes the first ever recipient of a pole transplant. He names the new attachment ""Percy."" Thus begins a dreadful exploration of where Percy's gone before and its new owner wants to be. Gar!"
5,Percy Review,A great light-hearted entertaining movie. Enough comedy to keep the viewer interested without being over the top. A movie for anybody.
3,Title misleading,"This pamphlet has little or nothing to do with preparing any research paper. It has everything to do with note cards and bibliographies, which is fine for the $1.00 I paid for a used copy."
4,the spy,I am interested in getting the lyrics to the spy who loved me and I cannot locate it. can you help?
5,Annual Register of Grant Support by Bowker,"This register lists organizations, programs and sources offinancial support for individuals and organizations. The bookis comprehensive in that it contains approximately 1400+ pagesof grant support listings. This book would be an excellentreference for fund raising purposes. For instance, there areextensive research activities funded by the Arthritis Foundationat 1330 Peachtree St. NW Atlanta, GA. 30309 at 404-872-8694located at dporter @ arthritis.org"
1,It works great - after I got my Treo 650 fixed,"This headset works great. The customer service at Etymotic Research is also excellent. When I originally got the headset, I thought there was a problem because I could barely hear on my Treo. I called Etymotic Research customer support and they cross-shipped a new headset. The new one didn't work either. Then I used my warranty on the Treo 650 to get this replaced. The new one works great with the headset - and the support from Etymotic Research is incredibly better than Sprint :). I can't change the star rating on Amazon, or I would change it to a 5."
2,Disappointed,After the wire broke on my Plantronics M170 (six years of constant use later) I decided to buy something different. Well I bought this Etymotic ER22 based on the reviews here on Amazon. It was a disappointment. I tried the different earpieces and never could find one that worked well. The microphone portion of the unit kept rotating down and away from my face. It is also difficult to see where the microphone is in relationship to your mouth without looking in a mirror. Mic placement is critical with this unit. A longer boom for the microphone and a headband or ear hook might be good additions to this unit. The sound was just ok. The included assortment of earpieces was a nice touch but alas I can only give this unit two stars. I bought a Plantronics M175C to replace the ER22 which has much better sound both sending and receiving. Anybody interested in a slightly use ER22? ;)
3,"Good mic, bad speaker","Arrived in mail, connected it to my treo and called my mom. She heard me just fine, which was a nice change from all the wireless earphones I have used in the past (two Nokias, plantronics, jabra). But even with a good seal in my ear, I couldn't hear very well. Maybe I have bad hearing or maybe it was the Treo. They are known for having low volume. Anyways, I returned it. I am so tired of shopping for something that will work. After hundreds of dollars worth of wireless and now this, I am running out of options."
5,Track List,Track Title1. Intro2. Break It Down3. In The Name Of Love4. Headline5. My World6. Whirlwind7. Interlude8. Hurricane9. Call For You10. Love Bites11. Wishbone12. Daughter13. I Wanna Dance With Somebody14. Dont Give Me Away
4,Captures A Truly Disturbing Ailment,"Most all of the so-called horror movies made today are just simple, formulatic nonsense that offer only jolts but nothing withstanding. Whatever happened to the genuinely scary like Psycho or The Exorcist? What we're most afraid of is not monsters or faceless madmen, but elements of our own psyche. This film is one not perfect, but it does succeed in striking a chord with those who desire a REAL reason to stay up at night.David Hewlitt is fantastic as Leon, a schizophrenic boy with an unnatural obsession with medical dummy Pin. The movie doesn't go soft or stereotypical and deserves more attention than the likes of pointless trash like Urban Legends or Valentine. If you wish to be truly mind-...... by a good psychological thriller, you owe it to yourself to see this flick."
3,not all that,"I love psychologically scary movies, and had read so many great things about this movie. It's definately not something I plan on watching again any time soon. It starts off very well, showing a family ruled by anti-germ freaks mom and pap, as well as their smart and well-mannered son and daughter. The son starts to believe that his dad's teaching aid dummy is alive, and spirals into an obsession with this doll after his mom and dad are killed in a car wreck. The storyline sounds great, and the acting is very good, but something just doesn't seem to work. I've never seen this movie to rent, so you might have to buy it in order to watch it. If you're looking for a good Psycho - rip off, rent/buy Santa Sangre or Dressed to Kill instead of this unenjoyable flick."
3,Becoming a cult classic,"If you like cult films, you'll have fun. The audio commentary was interesting... especially since the journalist quoted my imdb review. That was a little jarring. It is interesting to see how the film deviated from the novel due to pressure from the producers, which is too bad. But the actors do a good job of throwing themselves into it, and Terry O'Quinn (as the father) does a great job (as usual)."
4,CREEPY CREEPY CREEPY!,Terry O'Quinn is super creepy as Doctor/DAD. PIN is a super creepy alter-ego for [someone! I don't want to give it away]...Really fantastic.Not the BEST Horror Flick...but VERY VERY Entertaining.
2,The Copper did what Copper Does,"The copper started degenerating almost immediately after purchase, resulting in a surface on the lid of the kettle that was bubbly. I replaced this after a year of use."
1,Remixed? or trashed,"The sample tracks do not do justice to how bad this ""remix"" really is. Take great singing and compositions then add techno crap and you get this album. A one star only because no star is offered. It is hard to believe that her label allowed this thing to see the light of day. My favorite Sara song is Angel but it will now take some time to purge this horrible version out of my head."
4,Great Gift,bought this for my friend who is a big McLachlan fan. They loved it! Only problem was the price was a bit high for a remix album.
3,"remixed, AGAIN!",A good album of Sarah favourites but none of which are very new. There are other albums available which also feature some of these versions. I always wonder about remixes of Sarah's music as I am often left feeling that they detract from the beauty of the original track. It is however a must for all true Sarah fans. Enjoy!!!
2,No justice,"I must admit, this CD was a tiring. I found myself constantly skipping through the tracks to get to the few good areas. I am not one fond of remixes because they always mutilate the songs and do them no justice. This CD was no exception, I am sorry to say. The only way you could tell they were actually Sarah McLachlan's songs was by recognition of the lyrics and her voice. Almost all of the original melodies are gone.To those fond of heavy, pounding, repetitive club beats, this will be a good album for you."
1,Absolutely does Sarah Mclachlan music injustice,"I like Sarah and I like techno & dance, but the mixes on this are really BAD!"
2,I Can't Live My Life to 168 bpm Anymore,"Oy - I'm getting too old for remixed dance music. This disk seemed like a good idea (I purchased the import version about 2+ yrs ago)at the time.Some of the stuff is good - but nothing is outstanding. But any subtlety or nuance that McLachlan uses in her standard releases is gone w/these mixes (and isn't that true of most all dance/remix/electronic music?).My biggest complaint is that McLachlan (or more likely her record company) reissues her music in multi-formats (remixed or acoustic singles, 100s of compliations or soundtracks)almost ad nauseum.I guess the company has to make a buck when it's 6-7 yrs between original material."
4,US Release slightly differs from Foreign Import version,"Hi Jason from Seattle and ""Play"" from Singapore:(And all other Sarah McLachlan fans out there.)I too, was wondering why all the promotion for REMIXED at Vigin Megastore Burbank ? After 2 1/2 years. But hey, when I printed out this info you posted and the playlist posted on Amazon and compared it to the back of the CD, I noticed the tracks differ slightly. The Nettwerk version has a different version of Fear (Hybrid's Super Collider Mix), Angel (Dusted Remix), Silence (DJ Tiesto's in Search of Sunrise Remix), Hold On (BT Mix), and #6 and #7 are in reverse order. I don't know how these compare, or what the differences might be, but since they are titled differently on the international release I suspect that they are in fact different in sound as well as in name. Hope that clears everything up. Michael and Misti."
4,Good Stuff,"With the exception of BT's Hold On Remix, this is a great CD. The mood of the tracks keep true to the originals, while still adding quality trance. Sweet Surrender, Black, and Silence stand out. If you like trance, this CD will please. The only thing keeping me from giving a 5 is that I would like to see more experimentation with the mixes."
2,Yet ANOTHER filler album,"Since Sarah McLachlan hasn't released any new material since 1997's ""Surfacing"", I suppose her record company felt the need to once again release a filler album in an attempt to satisfy McLachlan fans who are craving new material. Now that Sarah has recently had a baby, I don't expect any new material from her until about 2003. Anyway, ""Remixed"" just doesn't cut it for this longtime Sarah fan. We've heard these songs one million times before and these remixes don't breathe any new life into them. The only ones I like are ""Angel"" and ""Hold On"" but the rest are silly and far too long. Unless you love dance music (which isn't music to begin with) try Sarah's ""Remixed"" album. I think I'll stick with ""Solace"" and ""Surfacing"" until she releases something new."
4,Just buy the thing,"Great album. Buy it. If you like Sarah's music, this is a fantastic album to compliment the others in your collection."
3,Couldn't get into it,As much as I like Sarah's music I couldn't get into Remixed. After Glow and many of the others are amazing though.
5,AMAZING!!!!!!,Wow.....Sarah has a beatifulllllllll voice!! And the remixes are amazing..I am hooked on them ....I love this CD...and I know you will too!
5,Confusion-great CD,"Okay, there has been some confusion about the fact that this CD has been in stores (and on Amazon) for a few years now and is being called 'New'. This is the US release. The other one is a Canadian import (which is why it was more expensive than this one). The Amazon track listing says it has the Rollo mix of 'Angel', instead of Dusted. It's the same mix, just names got changed somewhere. Also, the mix of 'Silence' is by DJ Tiesto, not Michael Woods. You can find the Michael Woods remix on Chillout 2002: The Ultimate Chillout.As for the CD itself, it rocks. It covers virtually every style techno out there, except for breakbeats. Check it out, even if you aren't a Sarah McLachlan fan. If you are a Sarah fan, you probably already have the Canadian release."
3,Remix is mixed,"I'm a fairly avid Sarah McLachlan fan, and I also like trance music, so I was looking forward to this album. I was disappointed, though, with what seemed to be a lack of imagination and innovation. It was a bit run-of-the mill, and a number of tracks lacked cohesion, i.e. the trance parts could have been laid down without listening to Sarah's original song, and merged together later! Chord changes in one don't match the other at times. What I had hoped to find compelling instead is only so-so."
4,!!!!!,"the song Barricades on this cd is AWESOME! i love that song, musically and lyrically its grand also World Dominator is really good too its more ska. ok well anyway this cd is good in what you'd expect from AAA, but its also a good cd i think for Common Rider, this cd makes me really want to get more Common Rider but i'm just too lazy right now to make the decision of which cd i want to get first. but yea this is a good cd"
5,works as described,"This is a good product. It works as described. Fits my audi tt perfectly. Although the installation was a bit of a pain in the ass, it wasn't due to the filter. Audi doesn't understand the concept of simple. Don't expect massive differences in engine response or huge improvements in mpg..."
1,Terrible product - don't buy!,"They didn't last three days, walking less than an hour each time. The bottom ""Sturdy, protective polyvinyl nonskid soles"" are plastic and breakdown when the temps are freezing or below. Without walking on any pavement/concrete, our Lab tore through the first boot on day one, another on day two, and shredded a third boot within five minutes of playing fetch on snow."
4,great for the winter!,"Of course wearing boots as a dog is not going to come naturally. And more than likely the first time they are put on them they will not only refuse to walk but once they do it will look pretty hilarious. However, once your dog DOES get used to them they are a wonderful protection to all the salts,dirt, etc that your dog would bring home otherwise. And they look adorable.Yes every so often a bootie will fall off... but for the most part they've been great for our shih tzu (who wears the extra small size)"
3,would be nice for dog with bigger feet,"Just wish this came in smaller size as it looked great on my dog, just would not stay on his feet two seconds. Had to return. Fortunately return was very easy and full refund was given."
2,Bouncy Bouncy,"The main theme to this show is ""how much can we make a show ....?"". Here's an idea, let's make a series with an okay cast, except let's make the main character as annoying as possible. And if the ship ever sinks into water, she needs to hold it up somehow........ Wow.... I never thought of that before.... flotation devices..... what a great idea.... Mmmmm orbs..... Okay, seriously, I did not enjoy Angel Links. The animation of this series is sub-par. In comparison to Outlaw Star this series is worthless. If you enjoyed Outlaw Star, you won't like Angel Links. Look at the one freaking dude that gave this show 4 stars.... He apparently loves the novels.... Which has what to do with the animation? I loved the book Starship Troopers... Ever see the movie? I think you get my point."
3,"Ok. not great, not terrible","If you were like me you loved Outlaw star and needed more. You saw that this was ""from the Outlaw Star universe"" and thought it had to be good. It ended up being just ok though. It follows Meifon Li a sixteen year old girl whose grandfather left her a private security organization named Angel Links (the same one from outlaw star) and adventures ensue. I didn't finish the whole series but only got to volume 3.The Good: It was cool to be back in the Outlaw star universe. The animation was pretty good.The Bad: I would have trouble taking orders from a 16 year old girl. I though her pet/sword was a little cheesy. I kept hoping the outlaw star would show up but it never did.Like I said it was ok but not great. If possible to rent I recommend instead of buying."
3,Give it a Chance!,"While angel links is no outlaw star it is an enjoyable Anime. Now for those of you who are expecting to see a lot of what made outlaw star what it is today, you should know angel links is totally different. Angel links centers around security group who fights pirate for free. The first DVD does not do much to advance the storyline. But once you get to the second dvd it advances a bit better. I would ask EVERY outlaw star fan to at least give it a rent. Because it is more than it seems if you stick with it. I am giving it a 3/5 stars (at this time) Once I have watched the third dvd I will update my review. Until then. Bye! oh by the way OUTLAW STAR FOREVER!"
4,junie b. cheater pants,this book is about a funny skeming trouble making girl named junie b. your never to young or to old to see her messing with her baby brother or classmates at school.In this book junie b. thinks taking answers from a homwork paper or firends giving answers to a test isnt cheating its sharing. i cant wait to see what juine b. jones is geting into this time.
1,Junie b. is not listening!,"She cheated on homework!She could have written her weekend on her paper.Instead,she took May's homework.What an Idiot!!!!!!!!She took Herb's spelling test and.....got in trouble.Then,Mr. Scary is on the next word and says,""Peek.I saw you peek.Peek.""Junie b. sits in her seat very still and gulps.She is not a good listener.She even got yelled at and got a spanking.I hate this."
1,HORRIBLE books for beginner readers!!!!!,"One day my 6 year old Son brought home a Junie B. book His 1st grade teacher reccommended He read. At first I thought the book was pretty cute, but as we got more and more into the book I noticed the HORRIBLE grammar being used in the book. Its not just this book either, the whole series has horrible grammar!!!!! I don't think its appropriate AT ALL for children who are beginning to read and spell to see that kind of grammar. I mean if it was once or twice throughout the book, okay fine that is kind of cute. But the whole book and SERIES is the same. Horrible grammar on every page (i.e. runned around my room, I helded my head up...ect.)Not only the grammar but Junie B. is a total brat!!! She whines and cries until she gets what she wants. What a handful!All the children in my Son's first grade class love these books! Its awesome they love books and reading but Its a shame they love such horrible books!"
5,Junie B. Cheater Pants is a Really Funny Book,Junie B Jones is a very funny kid in all of the books that is why I am going to read all of new and old series of the Junie B Jones books . I think that Junie B Jones is a real kid that is really really really funny.
4,Involved parent,"""Involved in my children's education"". The Junie B. Jones book series is an excellent tool to use to not only engage you children, but to educate as well. I can't order them fast enough. My seven year old reads them to her little sister and they are engaged for hours at a time reading and playing teacher, (YEA!!). They improving their reading comprehensions and build their vocabulary."
2,So Condescending I'm Nearly Speechless,"I normally don't mind a little political incorrectness - especially knowing I'm reading fiction. But wow, this one is just so over the top it leaves me nearly speechless. All that bashing left a sore spot, but what really did me in (besides the numerous one-sided phone conversations) was the condescension. Who treats people like that anyway?"
4,Sisters finding their own way,"London and Madrid La Mira are the twin daughters of an ultra rich man. They have never had to work for a living, get what ever they want and are generally spoiled rotten. Then there grandmother does something to change them. She cuts them off. She used to give them five or six figure checks for Christmas for them to blow, but instead she desides to hand over their clubs to the managers and make them actually work to know what real life is like.After some funny setbacks London and Maddy decide to do something different. Will it work out? Will they be better people? Read The Perils of Sisterhood"
3,needs improvements,"i bought this to put on my existing pole. I like the whole concept idea of this bird feeder but they need to do some major improvements on installing it on a pole. First of all, it is for a 1"" pole adapter but the hole on the bottom is not a screw type of installment. Just a plain smooth round 1"" hole that you slip on top of a pole. Therefore, it is not a tight fit and the bird feeder bottom tray is wobbling side to side with any weight applied to it. I returned it as I felt this was not suitable for pole installation but if you want to hang it with the loop, then you may want to give it a try."
2,Seemed like a good design at the time,"The squirrels not only beat this one by using their paws to reach the seeds, one of them chewed up the side, leaving shreds of plastic on the ground below."
1,Squirrels love it,"The squirrels in my yard must be really smart, because they enjoy feasting in this. It is also difficult to fill, empty shells, and clean. Get an ""Eliminator"" from Wild Birds Unlimited instead."
3,A Strong 3.5,"If his label had released Love Is Hell as an album made up of the two EPs it could have really gelled. That said, if you like (the ever-changing) Ryan you'll appreciate the mood he sets. Kind of 80s mope rock. Buy both and burn yourself a mix of the two for a more cohesive listen."
5,Excellent,"Why Ryan doesn't sell platinum, blows my mind. Try to get this as it was intended on vinyl as one release."
1,Ryan Adams Catalog Takes a Positive Turn...,"Ryan Adams has once again hit his stride. ""Love Is Hell, Part 2"" is his best work since ""Heartbreaker"". His voice is again powerful, and the songwriting is brilliant. Although not as consistent as ""Love Is Hell, Part 1"", part two gives us two of his best songs ""English Girls Approximently"" and ""Hotel Chelsea Nights"". The first being a poke at his relationship with singer Leona Naess, chronicles a break-up with a clever chorus that stays tongue in cheek. ""Hotel Chelsea Nights"" is a heavy look a living in a nyc hotel, the lyrics are overshadowed by the gutiar and keyboard that drone along accordingly, and the classic voice of marianne faithfull backing ryan creating the perfect harmonies. This is a keeper, although there is some filler, this a wonderful e.p, and a worthwhile addition to a young songwriters career."
5,ADAMS AMAZES,Ryan Adams never stops amazing me . . . this is no exception. . . . This album is nothing short or great . . . and as always his lyrics are piercingly emotional. . . I love this album and love Ryan Adams
1,Lyrical Vomit,"I grudgingly admit to being a Ryan Adams fan, but damn the man for sucking so bad. Heartbreaker was a work of genius but the fact is that his whole output since then has been on a downward trajectory. Rock N' Roll is garbage (not garage) but, hey, he just wrote it in five minutes right? Love is Hell was denied as an album for a reason. It stinks. The man needs to install some quality control. He has attached some half hearted lyrics to excrutiatingly boring tunes. To be fair, he has it in him to drop another gem like Heartbreaker, but his lack of discipline is killing him. (Apparently not, since every reviewer here seems to love him.)"
5,This is the Best Praise and Worship cd ever,I really enjoyed this cd it's awesome. Every song was good. I purchased another one by Grace and Mercy haven't listen to it yet but I'm sure it's good.
5,The temple,"Great addition to my book library, it will add to my study in the ministry to help not only my self but other."
3,Not for the casual reader,"I haven't time to read all of it yet. This is for the scholar and not for someone who ""just wants to know"". Also, this is not for someone who doesn't know anything about the Jewish ""temple"", its furniture, the priesthood, etc. There are excellent magazines available for those who don't want so much information."
2,The Temple-Its Ministry and Services,I didn't like it simply because it seemed choppey. It lacked cohesiveness and seemed to jump from one thing to the next. As if the information was being onveyed from the middle without a beginning or an ending for that matter.
5,The Sanctuary,"If you would like to really understand the Temple/Sanctuary and all that it meant, this book is for you. If you would like to see how important God's timing is.this book is for you. There are still appointed times such as the Sabbath that is a set day and appointed time to meet with God. There is so much, very deep and important things to learn and this book would be a great way to start learning how Deep God really is and how everything meant or represented something important to Our God."
4,The Temple,I echo the one thought of the first reviewer. Don't make the mistake I did of getting the cheaper used book. I truly thought I was getting the latest edition. Nope. This was the early edition with NO pictures. On top of that the writing style is antiquated. All of this has been improved in the 1997 edition with its numerous illustrations and updates on the archeology as well as modern english useage.
5,Men's G Shock,Great watch Great buy. Not to big with many features such as stop watch with constent seconds display plus many alarm settings. Duo time display plus date.
4,Member of the G Shock club!,"Great to finally be a member of the club! This is a solid watch at a very reasonable price and good if you want to keep track of a different time zone. However, if you travel I'd recommend the atomic version that will automatically update the time based on the time zone you are in. Changing the time this this model is a bit of a challenge."
2,Lacks current info and contains mistakes,"This map is basically accurate as of several years ago. It is not really current and also contains mistakes. For instance, running north from Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas it shows an portion of planned autopista as being complete. It simply does not exist. Want autopistas which do not exist on this map? Try Uruapan to Ixtapa, all but perhaps 10K completed and in use. How about Mazatlan to Tepic, for the most part complete. There are many errors in this."
3,Soothe Yourself,"The indie girl band Luscious Jackson scores in its second album and deliver an appealing set of songs which, although easy to listen and appreciate, are more complex than what they seem at first. This is clever lo-fi pop, stylish compositions with little nuances that cover diverse styles, from funk to rock, smooth spoken-word and even a bit of country. The record flows well and gets better with several listens, showing new elements and details. The opener and addictive ""Naked Eye"" is one of the best moments here and starts the record with a bang. The groovy ""Under Your Skin"" is another shining song, and both ""Faith"" and ""Stardust"" end the disc in a relaxed and captivating way. ""Fever In Fever Out"" is a fun little album and one of the good examples of the musical genres-mix that increased in the 90`s."
4,A Really Great Band!,"""Fever In Fever Out"" by Luscious Jackson is a great album. As a some what new fan, I have become obsessed with their very unique and fresh talent. They certainly give a mature effort to this CD and really hit the mark with great tracks such as, radio friendly ""Naked Eye"" and ""Under your Skin"" but, it's songs like ""Soothe Yourself"" and ""Stardust"" that really make this album."
2,I miss Manny!,"Judging by the glowing comments already here, I suspect my review will get panned...... Here goes:This is the album where Luscious Jackson lost their hip-hop edge. The songs before were a little more funkdafied, a little more bass-heavy, a little more soulful. Fever In Fever out is a lot more radio friendly and palatable, and kind of bland in comparison to LJ's previous efforts.I am sure this is a fine album, but it is so much more poppy and over-produced than the last 2 albums that I hardly recognize the band.I miss ""Natural Ingredients"" and ""In Search of Manny"". Be sure you check out these other albums."
2,"Eventually, Prechter will be right","While Prechter is admittedly the guru of Elliott Wave Theory, he has been predicting a major Bear market in U.S. Stocks since 1985. Two years ago he went on record as predicting DJIA 800 in the next five years, and DJIA 1500 within two years. The books to read by Prechter are his expositions on EWT, which are THE presentations of EWT. Rather like Granville for so many years, Prechter seems bent on crying ""bear"" until one shows up. Unless you are fond of hearing yet another theory on ""Why the economy will collapse and trash the world's wealth,"" skip this presentation by Mr. Prechter."
2,Prechter's second chance at playing Cassandra,"Prechter wrote a brilliant book about 1980 on Elliot Waves and then proceded to bask in the light of gurudom... That is until 1987, when his theories totally missed the October crash and a lot of his followers got their collective wallets smeared. As if to compensate for the missed crash, for the last decade Prechter has become obsessed with predicting the immanent crash of all civilization. Yes, The Bubble of the current market is going to burst. But Prechter keeps missing his prediction dates, and I believe he's also missing the extent. (At least I hope!) But still an enjoyable book if you don't take it *TOO* seriously."
4,There Aren't Many Books Like This One,"This book is really, really interesting. It was written by a man that had, to say the least, a very interesting life. Matt Warner's book is far from a ""tell-all"" but it is filled with the kind of detail that breathes life into the Old West as it really was. How do you REALLY get away from a posse? What is it like when the guns start firing? What were the hideouts like? We don't have many autobiographies of this kind and they should be read by all Old West enthusiasts for the real nuggets that they contain. Remember: this man really rode with Butch and Sundance and knew them well."
2,Throwaways for completists,"If you already have Sensous, then there are only two new tracks for you here.Clap Whistle Walk is a quirky rhythmic piece well described by its title and pretty much your average throwaway.The lengthy end track is a minute of acoustic guitar revolving around the US anthem (which made a very brief appearance in the main album) followed by the now familiar Cornelius-meets-SgtPepper procedure of stretching the harmonics of a final chord, only now he does it for 32 minutes, augmenting the volume towards the end. Those are nice concepts, perhaps, but not songs worthy of the price of this EP, IMHO."
3,Has potential,"I bought this album for the first title ""Sweat"" and didn't expect a whole lot from the other tracks--and my suspicions were mostly confirmed, Shizuo still has a way to go with his exploration of beats and music structure. He gets too repetitive and droning in a lot of his tracks. The repetition of themes in his songs makes me feel like a lot of them should be shorter in length.Nevertheless, Shizuo DOES assault the speakers with a hardcore noise sound. ""Sweat"", for example makes me think of someone machine gunning your subwoofer. Very frenetic, interesting album."
1,SMAL and VIOSTA,"I use whit other Screen and I wait the changhe to Other system , VISTA are BAD ,and MICROSOFT change thje explorer 7, for MY MICROSOFT send a CD a COSTUMER , whiTH VISTA for change to XP , and paid for the time in use this system very bad and LOW"
1,Cliched 80's film,"this film is very flat,Predictable,&Forgettable.Travolta&Curtis have no real CHemistry.this film was a Pre-Curser to the Magazine.Rolling Stone now is Just like this film."
1,"Grainy, pan and scan","Columbia is notorious for choosing full frame (pan and scan) over letterbox or anamorphic widescreen formats. Not only is Perfect NOT perfect because it's pan and scan, but the picture quality is awful--lots of grain, despite the claims about a digitally restored pic on the jacket.Why spend your $$$ on this sloppy reissue when Amazon has thousands more to choose from...."
4,The Aerobics Pied-Piper,"Major popcorn movie. No, not Oscar-caliber by any means, but a fun way to kill a couple of hours. Very much a product of its era (the 1980's), which is part of its appeal these days, a major flashback. If you're looking to relive the days of the Jane Fonda workout backed by the music of the Pointer Sisters, Dan Hartman, Berlin and a young (then yet unknown) Whitney Houston duetting with Jermaine Jackson, this is what you've been looking for. The plot is somewhat laughable (John Travolta as an ethically questionable Rolling Stone reporter in lust/love with aerobics instructor Jamie Lee Curtis, who is trying to hide a bit of a dicey past), but it's still a good time, what with the workout scenes and all the talk of promiscuous sex. Ignore the story for the most part and concentrate on the silliness that was the 1980's and you're in for a treat. Jamie Lee Curtis shines as always (and was in the best physical shape of her life). Good flick, goofy and mostly light fare."
3,Excellent soundtrack if you can find it,"I picked up the soundtrack on cassette tape after seeing this movie's first release. It was awesome and I listened to it all-the-time. Now of course, I can't find it anywhere. Every time our family stops at one of those ole-time truck-stops to get a burger or coffee, I always check out the old cassette bins. Last time, I found Shawn Philips Second Contribution ... not bad, but still not Perfect."
3,Ditto the last guy,"I found and bought a tape of Shawn Phillips' Second Contribution as well. The movie Perfect was so-so, but the music was to die for. So, why would the studio execs re-release Perfect without the soundtrack? It's been so many years and I still crave it!!!!!"
3,Only because Jamie Lee looks so gorgeous....,"The movie is really pretty silly -- but frankly I like to watch the aerobics parts of this whenever I need inspiration to work out! I know I could never look like Jamie Lee, but still, she looks incredible (not just her bod but everything). And I like it that her character is fairly independent and gutsy and doesn't take a lot of crap from Travolta. And I think the movie DOES capture the aerobics culture of the '70s. It's funny, also, that Travolta's laptop is a novelty to Jamie Lee (""Is that a computer?"") - when they're so commonplace now."
1,Anything but...,"Wow! Here it is. Very likely the worst movie I have ever seen. I had read about this film ages ago but never seen it. What was going on (if anything) in the minds of the people involved? This must be the movie which inspired ""Showgirls"". I thought that was the worst piece of doodoo until I watched this. No wonder so many actors' careers seemed to end with this one. I finally understand he meaning of ""bad taste"". Phew - quel stinko"
2,2 Stars for Carly,"Carly Simon's the only one worth watching on this DVD,but she's only in the film for 69 seconds,and her only line is ""I read that Sh-t you wrote about me.""and thats what this movie is"
4,Actually a pretty good film about journalistic integrity.,"Yeah, it's got some completely over the top Olivia Newton John ""let's get physical"" moments, but then again, this WAS the 80s and I lived through this era. ""Perfect"" is a pretty accurate and literate look at America's obsession with physical beauty, and along the way addresses the major ethical and creative issues that separate hack journalists and great writers. It's a pretty good story!I am kind of amazed at how quickly a film like this will be dismissed out of hand as plain goofy or some guilty pleasure. I know a lot of journalists, and many of them drive me nuts with their shallow take on the things they are supposed to be elucidating. That's exactly why Perfect works so well with the apparent superficiality of sexual culture and what painful truths it masks. It's got believable characters, a good plot, and is pretty entertaining to boot! How this film can have a 3-star rating and ""POC: At World's End"" have a 4-star rating is beyond me."
2,"Definitely not Oscar material, but a true 80's flick","This may be one of the worst movies ever made :) But honestly, just to watch it for Jamie's performance. She made a bad movie palatable. If you love the 80's, you're going to like this movie. It's not terribly bad, but it has its moments. Yet it's not terribly good either. If you like the stars, it will be fun and interesting to watch. We've come a long way in film making."
3,State of the art,"Compiled by top practioners in the field, this is the reference to have for those engaged in sequencing DNA in the modern plant taxonomy lab.For those not engaged in sequencing DNA this is a good book not to have."
5,Cute Silver Earrings,These simple silver earrings go with everything. They are lightweight and comfortable to wear.
5,Excellent in all respects,"An entertaining and informative book, worth purchasing just for the bibliography. The author weaves together Conan Doyle, obscure discoveries, famous murders and hugely entertaining forensic trivia into an excellent overview of the origins of forensic science and scientific homicide investigation."
4,Interesting stuff.,"It's less applicable, and more historical but it's very interesting. Went along perfectly with my introductory forensics course and the sherlock Holmes cannon. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes SH, or forensics. If you're expecting to read it and become an expert in forensics or the methods of Sherlock Holmes you'll be disappointed. The only thing that'll make you an expert in those areas is rigorous study via textbooks or very careful analysis of SH reasoning abilities, but it does a great job of conveying what the author intended. It's a pretty short, scientific, and informative read. I liked it."
4,Good,"The material is very resistant and easy to clean, this I like a lot.Big enough for notebooks with up to 15"" screens. It has enough pockets to distribute accesories, cell phones, etc.The removable notebook computer folio has been a good adcquisition too because some times you can just carry the notebook and nothing else.For me a little bit heavy but not too much."
4,Skinhead Reggae Scorcher,Liquidator was a complete skinhead hit. 30 Skinhead reggae classics on this 2 disc set. The first disc is good but with the exception of a couple of tracks the organ music sometimes reminds me of elevator travel. Dsic 2 is a complete scorcher. Great skinhead reggae all around.
1,Smaller than advertised,I've bought this style and size of shoe many times before. These were at least a full size smaller than before and I had to return them. Though I asked for a replacement in a larger size I was given a refund and told to re-order. When I did that the price had increased by $11.34. Bait & switch?
3,Look nice but they run extremely tight.,I bought these pair a half size too big to make sure that they were comfortable work sneakers that didn't look too much like sneakers. Unfortunately I will be either regifting these to someone with smaller feet or returning em. Look and feel are ok for the price but I was not expecting them to feel like I was trying to fit into a womens size sneaker.
4,Good kit of parts for mounting portable electronics,"I needed to mount my mobile phone reliably, in this case at home at my desk, even though the kit is made for use in a car. I'll be adding some of my own parts to do it. It isn't an exact fit for my Casio G'zone Ravine 2 phone, but it's close enough, and better than I could fashion myself out of wood or other Home Depot hardware. Four stars because it does what I need, not five stars because I have to hack it up and improvise a bit to make it work with my phone and mount to my desk. For example, without some hacking, it tends to press down on the volume control, causing annoying beeps all the time. So consider this some assembly required. The price could be a bit less for what it is, but it has some flexibility to work with a variety of telephones.It is NOT wide enough to work for smart phones, GPS's, etc; there are other models from the same company that look like they might be."
5,Drum Circle Spirit,"This book and CD set has wonderful examples of drum circle games and exercises. He and his facilitators also share their drum stories and let us know how fun it can be to be an ""Arthurian"" facilitator! Get a bunch of friends together and PRACTICE these games!(It REALLY comes to life after attending one of Arthur's facilitator playshops!!!)"
5,This Book has inspired me.,"The book is a inspiration,well written a joy to read.A video would be the next best thing."
5,I Like Mine,"I ordered this radio before I read the reviews. Then, after reading them I was worried that the one station I wanted to listen to on it might not come in clearly if reception was a problem. I am happy to say that the reception is great. It actually pulls in the AM stations better than my car radio. I'm pleased in every way with this radio."
3,"Practical advice, especially on File Sharing","This is high quality power user tips book for Panther. In particular the coverage of File Sharing between Macs, from Mac to PC, and over file sharing networks, is in-depth and excellent. Problem is that it's too short. If this is volume one I think they should have written volume two and put it in this book as well. The book just doesn't stand up to one of O'Reilly's in-depth Mac OSX books like Mac OS X in a Nutshell. That book doesn't cover specific topics, like File Sharing, in as much depth, but it does cover all of OS X and not just a small section like this book."
5,Fantastic fun,"I caught my first Boosh experience on the cartoon network's Adult Swim at 3am one night when I couldn't sleep. I've been hooked ever since. Creative, witty, silly and fun - this series takes you away from hum-drum to a world of comforting nonsense playtime happy zoo zoo wonder. It includes all three seasons of the television series and loads of really cool bonus material. Thank you Boosh for the Joy! It's like a fabulous vacation in a box, a fun-filled crazy holiday you can take anytime from your own living room. A world to explore again and again and discover something new each time you visit. This DVD set is of course a must-have for any Boosh fan, but also a perfect introduction to the World of the Mighty Boosh for anyone who's never experienced it before."
5,Amazing product!,"The Mighty Boosh is an incredible series and this dvd special edition is great to purchase the only negative feedback I could give on this product is that it does not contain the animated pilot episode of Tundra that only aired in the UK, Anyone who is a fan of british comedy will LOVE this series and spend many hours laughing away it is definitly memorable from the first time you watch it, it will have you wanting to watch it over and over again."
5,A Treat for Boosh Fans,"If you are a Boosh Fan, you will love this. It is the quintessential collection of every episode uncut plus a whole bunch of special features including shorts, outtakes, interviews and deleted scenes. I've had it for two weeks & I am still finding easter eggs left and right. I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves British Comedy, especially for those who love the Mighty Boosh."
3,Ummm....,"I love British comedies, and for me, the jury is still out on this one. I thought this would be a sideways move from the IT Crowd, but it's not.I will say that this is one of the strangest comedies I ever seen and can see why so many people like it. For me, though, not so much..."
5,Loved this!!!,"I really liked this film. I read the book and the movie came very close to what occured in the book. If I hadn't read it first, I would have been very frightened ."
2,not the Martin Scorsese that I remember,"It is truly sad to see a great director like Scorsese stop being creative, try to imitate, and fail so miserably. I guess it started when Departed garnered him an academy award. There is nothing original about that movie, and the Hong Kong version which it was based upon is superior. That is just the way things are in Hollywood. What is Scorsese trying to do here? Make another 6th Sense? At the end of 6th Sense, there was this revelation, ""ah, everything all make sense now"". At the end of this one, after following the plot the whole time and it just spent five minutes trying to convince you that this indeed was the truth, there is just no way it could work. You can still rent it, the cinematograhy is nice, and Scorsese assembled a very respectable cast, but don't expect a big payoff after all the suspense."
3,"Nice Twists and Turns, but...","I saw this film in the theatre and Leonardo's character is pretty creepy to say the least. But I found the story a bit predictable-I had a feeling towards the film's end who the real bad guy was-and I was right. Nice try Scorsese, but no cigar."
5,Brilliant,"Loved it. I found it entertaining and intriguing till the end, which delivers an unsuspected twist. Top notch acting delivering a juicy tale. This is a movie I would watch again. A jewel definately worthy of owning. Perhaps even holds an Oscar nomination."
3,Not great,This movie kept on skipping and freezing. I didn't end up watching the whole thing due to technical problems. Waste of money.
1,Empty box; no movie inside.,The box had no movie in it. The rest of the movies were great. Would like a new one. Thank you.
2,shiver me timbers leo,"decided willingly to jump down the rabbit hole and be manipulated with incongruent story lines, images, and characters... kept waiting for Alice to wake up but no can do... I swear I was all in till the end and figured there has to be some type of redemption for all this mindless plot meanderings, given the Marty seal of approval, oh well, guess I will live, and not recommend this film for any purpose..."
2,"Should be called ""Bad Movie Island""","I don't understand why this movie has received so many positive reviews. ""Shutter Island"" has the makings of a good thriller but never gets off the ground. The plot is good, the cast is great, and the cinematography is super cool. But everything else is just downright stupid: not scary, not creepy, and super obvious. I felt like Scorsese was dumbing down to his audience the whole time. The trailers for this film were much better than the actual movie. Skip this one."
4,Complex and captivating! 3.5 rating.,The film begins just as another thriller - 2 men on a mission.Actual puzzle opens up much later - when the 'cat' himself discovers that he has become a mouse - or in trap much bigger and sinister in nature.It is rather a complex film - better followed on repeat viewing.Reminded me Hitchcock (Vertigo in particular) as well as little bit David Lynch.A tight and gripping film but I will mention two points:The film ends rather abruptly.Also all through the color and camera were too inclined to typecast this as a mystery or a scary movie - as if something to happen; all persons in the island behaved strangely to strengthen the impression - that could have been avoided.
2,Surprise?,"Yeah, my wife and I pretty much figured this movie out 20 minutes into it which made it seem rather silly. After a while we were just wondering if there was supposed to be another twist as it was so obvious.It had some entertainment value, I suppose."
5,Great Movie,"The movie still gives me chills every time I watch it. I find new clues every time I re-watch it. Wonderfully directed, extremely well-shot with a creepy and ominous score. Easily one of my Top 5 movies of the year."
5,A suspenseful murder mystery,I generally don't like Scorsese films but I liked this one. Sustained suspense throughout. Suggest watching with the lights off and candles lit throughout the house!
3,relaxing film noir,Relaxingll and held interest in its film noir genre until up to half way. I could be biased since modern film noir's never seem to match up to the 1940's and I miss Bogart or even Dirk Bogart etc... But it seemed to run out of steam and become cliched.Dicaprio no longer looks puerile now he's aged and Ruffalo mysteriously lost his gorgeous sex-appeal in this film. However for Dicapro fans its a good performance. I could be biased.
1,Waste of time and money,This movie was nothing like the preview and was completley misleading. It was one of the worst moves I have this year if not all time. Don't waste your money or your time.
1,Idiotic,"I cringed throughout most of the movie, not because it was a thriller, but because of the rampant stupidity throughout. To be sure, there are a lot of visual scenes which are rivetting, but the plot itself is laughable. It amazes me that after a century of making films, Hollywood still cannot portray mental illness in an accurate manner. The ""hallucinations,"" the ""radical therapy,"" the sanitarium for ""the criminally insane"" are all laughable and as far from reality as can possibly be. The trailers/previews of the films were actually better and more promising than the actual film. Oh, well."
1,No surprises here!!!,"Forget feeling surprised by the supposed ""twist"" ending. Unless you're easily amused, there are no surprises here. The previews/film clips made this movie look way more interesting than it actually was. You can pass this one up. You won't be missing anything! One good thing -- the photography was great!"
1,Bad movie,"Plain, bad movie. The plot is very bad.Ending does not make sense at all.I don't even recommend renting this movie."
1,Shutter Island,"The movie is good then you get one hour and some minutes into it and it goes downhill and becomes obvious with all the circles it goes in,flashbacks TO WWII to some self Righteous Talk about how bad commies were treated(No they were not, They had due process in the 50s) to realizing half way what a bad idea this story has become and then Thanking God when it is over and that I didn't pay to see it,A good movie Wasted down the tubes when it unravels."
1,The turd sandwich is being served.,"What a let down. A horrible waste of talent all around. Don't waste your time. Lastly, I am very disappointed that the very amiable Max Von Sydow had to be sullied in this. So sad."
4,The spaces in between,"This movie taught me to NOT read reviews before I watched it. One reviewer revealed that as the whole movie was nothing more than a bad dream it was ruined. Au contraire. There is plenty in this movie to force the watcher to watch again and again to answer the many nagging questions/mysteries put forth. That's what I love about this movie. Even in the end, you really are not sure what is real and what is not. The director, Martin Scorcese, is not known for this type of film. I hope he'll take another shot with this fine thriller/mystery."
4,good suspense film,"I saw this film at the theater and liked it so much I purchased it. It's good the second time around as you know the ending and catch things you might have missed the first time around. Definitely worth seeing. Nice twist, suspenseful, good story."
2,Yawn,"Ugh. I didn't know this was Scorcese, when I saw his name at the end, my jaw dropped and an old King Missile song started playing in my head. This could have been so much better. Has some interesting moments, but overall, quite boring and predictable. I predicted in one scene what would happen, just by the music and camera angle. If you've never seen Alfred Hitchcock movies, then you might like this. It's definitely not scary, but decent suspense."
2,I Shuddered....,"IMHO, when a movie resorts to the cheap scare - people jumping out, accompanied by loud blasts of discordant music - it's time to move on to something more productive. This amateurish annoyance must have been employed half a dozen times in Shutter Island. Frankly, one would hope for better from Scorsese. The good acting and gothic sensibilities of the movie were badly weighted down by plot holes and a ""surprise"" ending you could see coming long before it arrived."
3,Different for a Scorcese film,"I found the movie compelling, but some of it seemed a bit convaluted as far as plot. Some moments reminded me of ""One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest"" influence. The music was very good and creates quite a bit of the mood to the film. The cast was very good as a whole, but I found it to be a bit strange."
2,sinister,"Great visuals, somewhat predictable outcome, haphazard evolution of plot. Not a movie that is very satisfying to watch, it's all over the place.The dialogue is very choppy, sort of like video game style.The movie ends, and you have to wonder about the objective of it all."
2,Don't Waste Your Time,First the good: Excellent production values. Very artistic.Now the bad: Pretentious and stilted. Music is almost comical - it's so over the top awful.Conclusion: Don't waste your time.
2,Don't Worry About Spoilers...,"...this movie spoils itself from nearly the first of its CAD scenes (Scene 1). That's not the only slapped-together aspect this waste of time offers: how about dull improbable dialogue, wooden acting, and a nonexistent pulse of suspense-building or terror. Totally flops, it was putting me to sleep so I finally bailed. It gets two stars for a few imaginative sets and shots, that's about it.Another example of how it takes a good director and story. Hitchcock could do something shorter, in black and white or color, without the graphic stuff,no computers, and have you on the edge of your seat."
1,The movie falls off a cliff half way through,"This movie SUCKS. No script, no plot, bad writing, BORING. Half way thru it gets extremely stupid. BAD BAD BAD"
2,A ripoff of the movie A Beautiful Mind,What can I say. I was very disappointed. A Beautiful Mind was much better and original.
1,Would have rated it less if I could have,"This was a very bland movie, bland acting and had a bland plot. The ""twist"" ending was very predictable. The reason I had to suffer watching this movie was because I was on an international flight and was stuck watching this atrocity."
5,Greaet movie!,This movie really makes you think and can leave you wondering. The plot for this movie is great. If you liked Inception you'll definitely love Shutter Island
5,Island Of The Damned...,"I've loved Martin Scorsese ever since watching BOXCAR BERTHA in the theatre as a kid. I've especially enjoyed his gangster films (GOODFELLAS, CASINO, DEPARTED), also TAXI DRIVER, RAGING BULL, and CAPE FEAR. However, deep down, I'm a horror / thriller fanatic, so SHUTTER ISLAND came as a wonderful surprise! From the outset, the entire atmosphere is gloomy and full of dread. The characters are interesting, and the story is dark. Leonardo DiCaprio is perfectly suited for the twists, turns, and shocks involved. If you love suspense, mystery, and thrills, then SHUTTER ISLAND should flip your lid!..."
5,Amazon fails miserably on lightning deal,"Great movie, great price, but not given the price that it was ordered at. I ordered it as a CyberMonday lightning deal, but was charged the higher price. They refuse to honor the price as they claim to not know what price the lightning deal was for."
3,It's a conspiracy!,"It was good for passing time, much more entertaining than watching paint dry or something similar. So can't complain.The so-called twist was telegraphed at the very beginning of the movie, which is OK, cos at least it made some sense. Much rather have a little predictability than some totally outlandish ending that is not supported by anything you have been shown.The general premise of this film is not too interesting unfortunately. Mental illness, illusions, effects of past trauma. Not very engaging. You do keep watching though cos you wanna pat your own back that your hunch in the beginning was correct, even though you hope it wasn't.The ending is not satisfying at all. Overall not an uplifting experience.5 out of 10"
2,Potential Flushed Down the Toilet,"Two U.S marshals (Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo) are sent to investigate how a woman disappeared from her room at a remote insane asylum. While Dicaprio's character, Teddy is at Shutter Island because he thinks the man that killed his wife in a fire is there as well.If the movie actually stayed on course with that plot, it would have been really good. I was thinking in the beginning of the silliest and stupidest way the movie could end and what the twist could be and....I was right!It's a shame because the movie had a lot of potential due to Martin Scorsese as the director and due to the cast and the plot. The end isn't ingenious, it's just a cop out. It goes around all the questions we have about what's going on and just gives us a simple answer that doesn't even make sense."
3,Shutter Island,It was an enjoyable movie to watch until the end changed the whole story line. Didn't like the ending. It's hard to accept the ending.
3,;0),"I actually liked the movie, through out the movie it was good half way through I kind of knew how it would end. Won't spoil it for those who haven't seenit yet but if you watch the movie The Others it's basically similar. Decent acting not the best work. I it's still a very watchable movie."
5,Loved the movie! Hated the quality of Amazon's Play on Demand,"I recently payed 9.99 to own a digital play it now copy of Shutter Island. Though the movie was amazing in itself the quality of video I got from the On Demand feature was far from perfect. And of course Amazon doesn't allow returns or refunds for digital downloads. When trying to find out what I could do I was relayed to the trouble shooting area of the website telling me to check my internet connection and so forth. I know my internet was just fine in fact the Play it Now player stated I had a ""high"" quality connection while viewing the film. But to my dismay the video would freeze and the sound was more than a sentence off from where it should have been creating confusion as to who was saying what. I feel cheated and may never use this option again. I advise using caution when contemplating a download. Spend the extra couple of dollars buying a hard copy!"
5,"Great, intense thriller","Loved this moody thriller that keeps you guessing. I read the book beforehand, but the mystery was still amazing to watch unfold."
4,Good movie,Suspenseful with a twist at the end. Not suitable for young children due to intense imagery. Historical inaccuracies in the depiction of the liberation of Dachau.
3,"Decent casting, sticks closely to book narrative","Like virtually every movie based on a novel, I'm glad I read the book first because I was then able to pay attention to nuances in the movie. However, I'm not sure whether I would've like the movie more if I hadn't read it first. The book was a fairly quick read but the movie's pace felt relatively slower. I do appreciate how closely it followed the book, though. It omitted a few scenes but didn't take liberties with the story. DiCaprio did a fine acting job as usual, but he wasn't what I pictured for the Teddy character. He has too much of a pretty boy look that doesn't reflect the stress endured by the character."
4,Delusional movie leads you on ...,"I thought Shutter Island was going to be an action horror movie. Wrong!Was it about an opening like a door? No!Was it about an opportunity opening like a window? No!Did it make me shudder?Uh huh ...Great casting, but I think the movie was wasted on a psychological journey of the human mind ..."
2,Misleading trailer,"Spoiler alert!!The trailer for this movie is one of the most misleading I've ever seen. My wife thought is was going to be a horror movie, as did I to a degree, or at least a suspenseful movie.25 minutes into it felt like an hour. At that point I guessed Leo was the crazy one. As my wife said at the end......that's 3 hours of our life we will never get back."
2,Disappointing,"A long time ago Martin Scorcese made vibrant films. ""Raging Bull"" could be considered the most brilliant American film of all time, and ""Casino"" and ""Goodfellas"" were engaging and captivating. Then for whatever reason he began collaborating with Leonardo DiCaprio, who while still a strong actor is nevertheless a poor substitute for Robert DeNiro: DiCaprio's intensity and angst seems forced, while DeNiro is just so flawless and natural under Scorcese's direction.""Shutter Island"" is a psychological thriller, and a very poor one at that: the plot is just too incredible and too slow to capture viewers' interest. ""Memento"" may be a bit incredible, but it was smart and striking. The plot of the ""The Machinist"" was not really that captivating, but Christian Bale's performance was just so memorable. There is nothing to recommend ""Shutter Island.""I read the book first, and I liked it. That's why I found the movie so unbearable to watch."
1,Really 0 Stars,This movie starts out well enough - nice creepy vibe. Then it becomes very convoluted and just seems to drag on and on. I won't reveal the ending but I thought it was a cop out. To me a total waste of 2 hours.
1,where's the beef??,"I am a huge fan of Leonardo Dicaprio. He has such a great talent for so many characters. Unfortunately, for him, this is not one of his best parts. Oh, he was, as usual, interesting, however the story line was far less clever. Was anyone really not sure, after several of his flash backs, just how the story was going to play out?? It started out promising, but soon fell to mediocre after the first 35 min or so. I kept watching because I already bought the movie, and because the shinning reviews promised there would be something redeeming in the story line. It was not to be. If you just like to look at Leonardo and don't care about the story, then by all means get the movie. But if your looking for a thriller, or some real substance or thought, forget it, you aren't going to find it here. Hopefully, he will be able to find a worthy script sometime soon. He has made some great films."
5,A Masterpiece!,"This film is certainly a masterpiece, a dark, expressionistic examination of the human soul. I believe it to be Martin Scorsese's finest film since ""The Age of Innocence."" Particularly fine are the performances of Mark Ruffalo, Patricia Clarkson (surely one of our finest actresses), and Max von Sydow.The soundtrack, compiled from several contemporary (classical) composers, is astonishing!Highly recommended."
1,THE CABINET OF DR. SCORCESE,"I will be happy when Martin Scorcese realizes that Leonardo DiCaprio is not the second coming of Robert DiNiro.I suppose that my dislike for this movie came from the fact that about 15 minutes into the movie, I ""Got"" it. I'm sure that many others did also. I knew what the big secret about SHUTTER ISLAND was, rendering the movie tedious and boring. I stayed with it until the bitter end anyway because I am a big Scorcese fan.The central theme and the movies' big surprise reminded me of Roger Kay's THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI from 1962 with its screenplay by ROBERT BLOCH.I'll give this movie two stars; one for the gorgeous visuals and another for the gallery of fine supporting performances.This movie is way too long for its plot.This project would have been better if it had been directed by Brian DePalma."
2,Predictable,"This is a beautiful looking movie but the plot is subpar. We skipped it in the theaters because we thought we had it figured out just from the commercials. We did and that's no mean feat for my significantly larger. Mark Ruffalo is fantastic but as a whole, this story was weak. Will DiCaprio ever play a normal, untortured soul?"
3,"Great cast, so-so plot.","Shutter Island directed by Martin Scorsese is a very ambitious film but kind of boring as well. Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Ruffalo, Michelle Williams, and Ben Kingsley round out the talented cast but even their acting chops can't save this psychological film from barely staying above float. The film doesn't really get interesting until the last 45 minutes - very disturbing and hard to watch but that's the only section of this film that grabbed my attention. So-so thriller, a mixed bag for me."
2,"Not very entertaining, strange ending","I did find Shutter Island to be a little entertaining but just really could not get into it. The ending was really strange I thought and could have been better. It is set like in old times 1950's, 60's etc and has that type of feel to it. The movie almost reminded me of titanic a little, maybe because of it's that same older times feel or because L. DiCaprio was in it as well. There is a lot of suspense, mystery and really never got board watching it yet for some reason just did not find it very interesting. A better ending could have changed my opinion for sure.Peter J. Miller"
2,Lacks a good ending,"I read the book, and I watched the movie, hoping it was better.. I Guess Shutter Island just falls short in my mind.. The story is good until about the middle, where it starts to fall apart. and the ending just makes the entire story not make any sense.. With a better ending, the movie could be great, but it simply falls short"
3,i wanted it to be something else...,"i'm actually not sure what happened, and i know that is the idea... but it was creepy and a bit slow for me.but it was well done."
2,Really??,"Slow pace, confusing dialog and just so-so acting made this movie a complete bore for me. I found myself wandering around the kitchen getting snacks, playing with the dogs and almost falling asleep on the couch. None of those are good signs of a great movie. I loved the preview, but most of the best stuff I had already seen from that. Even the surprise ending didn't help. I just sat there saying to myself ""Really?""."
4,scorsese brilliance again !!!.,"martin scorsese has done it again,with another brilliantly directed film. two feds(leonardo dicaprio and mark ruffalo)are sent to investigate the dissapearance of a psychiatric patient from a mental asylum,located on an isolated island. what ensues is both mystery and suspense as we are dragged along each corners of this sinester asylum. cant say more without spoiling the plot,but suffice it to say you are in for a mind blowing ride."
4,Cape Fear ....But on (CGI enhanced) Hallucinogens instead of Steroids.....,"Scorsese is fond of old Hollywood and genre pictures. Although hard core Scorsese fans prefer his more original work, his remakes like Cape Fear tend to appeal to filmgoers who might not usualy go to see a ""Scorsese"" picture.Those who like the film are speaking of the way the film messes with your sense of reality but then so do films like Kubrick's The Shining and just about everything else in the psychological suspense/horror genre.This is psychological suspense amped up with a good dose of gothic horror. Scorsese is certainly bending genres here, but the content is pretty typical of those genres that he borrows from--good v. evil, trauma induced identity crisis, alternate realities as coping mechanisms for the horrors of the real one.I'll admit that the film does some masterful (CGI enhanced) things to create mood & atmosphere but I think most film fans want something more than a thrill ride from this filmmaker."
3,alright,"the quality of the movie was really good and i liked the overall story, but it's all been done before. the ending is very predictable and also this type of ending has been done in other movies which are better."
2,"BIG NAMES, BIG HYPE, BIG PROFITS","SHUTTER is a star vehicle. DiCapro and Scorsese. One on the way up but perhaps peaking, the other running on a great reputation. I know, that sounds cynical. But doesn't it make sense? If the names were absent this complicated/predictable jumbled/simplistic piece wouldn't have made a box office ripple. I collected the movies that made them famous, not the take-the-money-and-run movies just made for money or keeping bankable names in front of audiences.A great performance, not-enough seen, five-star movie for DiCaprio is THE BEACHThe Beach.(Very curious... This unique, very-well produced movie is available at Amazon only in VHS (used) or paired witha Tom Cruise film or used for as low as $.63!/DVD.)Director Scorsese greats? Too many to list, go browse. From Taxi, Raging Bull,Goodfellas, to Last temptation of Christ, Kundun ...all great films."
3,big disappointment,"I couldn`t wait for this movie to come out on DVD, but was disappointed when it did. Too long and too dark. Why are the movies today so dark? It should be viewed a second time to fully appreciate, but who wants to spend over two hours watching it again? And while I`m on the subject of length, who wants to spend a whole day going over the bonus features of one Blue Ray movie?"
3,Good,"Some people guessed the ending early on, others didn't. Many films have come out with twist endings so a lot of people can see them coming now a days, but Scorsese's direction does make a difference.This movie is not likely to inspire or become a classic like Taxi Driver or Raging Bull, but to just enjoy sitting down and watching a new movie, this works."
3,Pretty Good!!!,"I thought was movie was alright. I didn't love it, yet I didn't hate it. One thing I loved was that it took place during the 1950's, because that's my favorite era. I also loved all the gothic dream sequences, and the look of the film. It gets a little confusing toward the end. DiCaprio plays a U.S. Marshal named Teddy Daniels, and Ruffalo plays his partner named Chuck Aule. They are investigating the disappearance of a woman named Rachel Solando at an asylum for the criminally insane. Due to bad weather, Teddy and Chuck are stuck on the island, and must deal with the crazy inmates. and Teddy is forced to face his demons. I'd probably recommend SHUTTER ISLAND!!!"
5,As good as American Horror Story!,"Very moody, thought-provoking movie.As close to American Horror Story (season 2) as anything I've seen.Loved the tension, the intelligence underlying the whole thing.Highly recommended."
4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...],"""Is it better to live as a monster or to die as a good man?"" That is the last line in this mind bending thriller from Martin Scorsese. It perfectly describes this film, which I can honestly say is one of the smartest and most savvy films I have ever seen. Leonardo DiCaprio gives his best performance to date. I've seen a lot of DiCaprio, since Titanic, we all have, and this is by far the best he's ever been. How he didn't win an Academy Award for this role is beyond me! The story is very strong and very smart. It's evident that they took their time with this one, in order to get every detail right. The ending is of course the best part. It leaves you scratching your head, going over everything you've just seen and keeps you thinking for hours. No matter how many times you see this movie, you'll always pick up on something new, each and every time. It was an amazing movie and I can't recommend it enough!"
5,"Great acting, great directing, great movie.","Not to give anything away, but my husband and I talked about the final twist all the way home. The movie was claustophobic, unnerving, and completely effective. The acting--especially Leonardo diCaprio's--was excellent. I recommend it highly."
4,interesting film,"All I can really say (without giving any real spoilers) is that I liked this movie, and it had a cool surprise ending. Well, maybe for people who like this kind of movie, the ending isn't that much of a surprise, there are a few hints here and there that things are not quite what they seem, but they're not so blatantly obvious as to make it east to guess how the movie might end, so it was fairly satisfying.The storyline and acting are rather solid, and the camerawork is well done. I don't really have any major complaints about this film. If you're a fan of the actors that star in this film, you shouldn't be disappointed."
5,Great,"I love this movie. This arrived in good time and was in good shape. I accidentally bought the wrong version though, that was my own fault"
5,DVE,"WRONG PRODUCT - KEPT IT.Great price, fast shipping, just what I wanted.Not much more to say great item, and works great.would buy again"
3,Leo is the man!,"You know, I'm not sure that I really liked the story of this movie all that much, but it is worth watching just for Leo's performance alone!"
4,"Can you say ""Conrad Veidt""? Sure you can.","I'm sorely tempted to spoil this film, but I won't. I'll limit myself to three brief remarks.>> If I said ""Shutter Island"" was a suspense story with a twist ending, it would be completely true -- and completely false.>> Those familiar with classic films will have no trouble figuring out what's happening 15 minutes on.>> Note Scorese's references to ""Vertigo"" and ""Psycho"" (and possibly other films I missed).If you want to be surprised, don't read too many reviews. Including this one."
2,Obvious and basically boring,"Despite the clever casting, the ""trick"" to this movie is obvious almost from the very beginning. Once you see the illusion being created, the characters are stereotypical and really uninteresting. If the writing has been a lot more clever and intelligent, the plot of the movie wouldn't have been so obvious and perhaps held my attention a bit longer, but at a fundamental level the characters have nothing new to tell us nor do they shed any new light on the kind of evil that exists in the world."
2,Not a whodoneit not a horror film,"Well, first there is no island like that within fifty miles of Boston, let alone within the harbor islands plus other factual errors. It well may be that this type of movie just doesn't appeal to me, but neither I or my wife liked it at all."
2,stupid movie,don't waste your time. confusing plot about people you don't care about and possibly will never understand what really happened.
2,TO LOOONG & BORING!,"Awful, long and boring! While the acting was very good I felt the story line was something I had seen before. Not really scary just confusing at times. Glad I didn't spend the money to see it at the movies. Very disappointing."
1,Ends with a whimper. Not worth the time,"Spoilers!Shutter Island has a pretty engaging beginning, but after about an hour of the 2 hours+ show, you will begin to notice things become so convoluted - not in a good way - and the tension building less and less believable, that there is just no possibility left for a satisfying ending. And by satisfying I mean one that would make the time spent and the attention given worthwhile. At least somewhat worthwhile.And so, the great, extra-long, big-budget, big-names movie ends with a sorry little whimper.That's it? Yep! It's just another 2 hours of your life gone by, dear valued viewer."
1,Um this movie like sucked,"Wow, was this movie terrible, from the opening scene of them on the boat (which looked like it was shot in like 1933 or something, with actors filmed in front of a huge projection of a sea) till the last ""twist"" ending. Not scary, not believable, crummy acting. Blah."
1,spellschocked.,"let's not waste one drop! Must have been hell for the actors - wet most of the movie - and even more of a nightmare for the costume department ...... somewhat a total wast eof time - nicely atmospheric, but the performances are blah - very blah.Mr. Scorsese - stick to what you know best - Hitchcock is sorely missed."
1,Worst movie ever,"After you find out that 3/4 of the movie you watch, never happens and is all an illusion. This was probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen"
1,WEIRD!,"This movie was interesting and had a good plot or whatever, but there are a few just plain WEIRD scenes that I didn't enjoy at all!!! Also, there is a terribly sad part of the movie that involves children and drowning that I just couldn't bare to watch."
5,Touch and Feel Farm,"This is a cute first book for infants.My 4 month old and my toddler enjoy it. It is your basic classic touch and feel,very nice photographs,a few words on each page.Even though it is not a ""story"" each page has a blurb about the animals; the only thing that would be nice is if it had some kind of ending.We gave this to my daughter for Easter since she's too little for candy. It was perfect."
5,Love at first touch,My 13 month old grandson loves to touch and feel each page. It's one of the books he goes back to over and over again.
3,like it!,"I bought this book when my daughter was 8 months. Content wise, I love it. It is cute, introduces farm animals and different textures and held my daughter's attention at that age and when she got a little older. Quality wise, I was disappointed. Not very sturdy, a rather thin board book and it got very shabby very fast. I'd buy it again although NOT for $7."
3,Touch and feel book,"The book is sturdy,cute and of good quality, but my toddler was not impressed. I thought she would like the book better then she did."
5,A Page Turner!,"What a great book with such vivid detail and dramatic intrigue! The characters are very believable, despite Jennie's almost spiritual gift. Duke Southard also adeptly uses historical detail that parallels the characters through their lives. A very moving and intriguing novel. I can't wait for his next one!"
4,the pleasure was all mine!,"I found A Favor Returned to be a page-turner from the very first page. It was a rivoting portrayal of a very descript family in a very descript time period in American history, which Duke Southard beautifully paints with his words. The premise of the supernatural presence intertwined within a very real young girl with no idea of the lack of boundaries of her gift made this novel one I couldn't put down. I just wanted to see what Jennie could do next! Like life, Jennies gift, and Duke Southards book have unforseen twists and turns that keep the reader intrigued, and at times worried, but always entertained!"
5,One of the best line of books I've read.,This is the third time I have read through this book and I still love it. the story has a great speed and devolops each character very well and is an over all easy read. I highly recomend this book to anyone who truly loves Star Wars!
4,Great series,"I've been reading this series to my son. This is the 2nd volume out of four - there was also a short story at the end. These are pretty good reads - a bit long for sure. And the climax of the stories aren't as big as one would expect, given the size and scope of the plot up the to endings. But this doesn't take too much away from the fact that these are enjoyable entries in the Star Wars universe. I look forward to reading the last two installments."
5,Excellent science fiction series,The Star Wars Clone Wars Republic Commando series greatly expands the Star Wars extended universe. This series has good character development and interesting plot developments.It is true science fiction in that it explores the morality and mechanics of creating clone soldiers. What would they think? How would they act? How would they respond to knowledge of the wider civilian world?This series explores the role of some Jedi far from the center of the fight - not everyone can be a swashbuckling hero. This series also subtly expands main subplot of the Clone Wars - the emperor's manipulations of the war to achieve his final goal.Nice attention to detail of commando military kit and procedure without distracting from the story. The commandos are who you'd want to be it you were a clone trooper.
4,Another good book,"I like all of the Republic comando books I have read, and this one is no exception. Traviss always has good Mando stories for us."
4,More Action,"I didn't like this one as well as I did Hard Contact. Let me tell you why. I'm a more of relationships reader not an action reader. Yes I want there to be action but I don't want it to be the main story of the book and it is in this one. I'm not going to write a plot summary because so many already have written about it. I loved how Ms. Traviss brought the other characters that were mentioned in Hard Contact into this book especially Kal and Orbo. I loved how you found out more about how the clones came into existance and what their training was like. Yes, I enjoyed the action but at times it was overwhelming to me to figure out what and who they were talking about. I really enjoyed the progression of Etain and Darmin. I can't wait for more of the books about the commandos and the Nulls. I would highly recommend this book to any Star Wars fan but read Hard Contact first. I just couldn't give it 5 stars but it's still a great book."
2,Gundark in the Ointment,"I read `Hard Contact' with some trepidation. I loved the idea of the Republic Commandos and enjoyed it for what it was. Karen Traviss' first book was exceptional; entertaining, clever, and a perfect complement to the Star Wars mythology. `Triple Zero', however, is nicely written, but suffers from ""too much"" syndrome. The whole Mandalorian language and cultural aspects of the Commandos seemed pulled whole-cloth from the Klingons in Star Trek. After a while, the similarities became overwhelming and I started to have doubts. Coupled with the romance between Etain and Darman (are there any stable Jedi out there?), and the idea that dedicated killing teams are reduced to John LeCarre-style spying on the homefront, I had to step away. Long ago, I had stopped buying all Star Wars (and other licensed) books, I was really hoping that this series would be the one Star Wars series I'd pick up. That isn't going to happen."
4,Pretty good book,"This book was not as good as the second one, but was a pretty good book overall anyways."
5,Great read!,"It's books like this one that adds validity and meaning to the Star Wars EU. With so many books pretending to be the movies, or books that add nothing or add something awkward, its nice to be refreshed by a book that delves into the depths of the Star Wars world. Triple Zero has nothing to do with any main Star Wars characters, but that is its biggest strength. The clones are not mindless drones willing to do whatever, but rather like children experiencing the world for the first time. Yes, they are battle hardened, but they no nothing of the intricacies of the real world. Much like any child would do, they rely on a father figure to help guide and protect them. Karen Traviss weaves a tale that is so deep and rich that the reader doesn't care that no main characters show up, we just care for the characters and the relationships between them.Great read!"
3,Doesn't feel like Star Wars... because it isn't,"Triple Zero is the second book in the Star Wars: Republic Commando series. It won't remind you of Star Wars. It is about the individuals and units that are clones... the Republic Commandos. Where are their loyalties? What are their dreams and aspirations? How are they different from non-clones? You learn these facts, and more, in Triple Zero. In Star Wars, the tin can clones are generic, cannon fodder, and, of course, ""the same."" In Triple Zero, they become unique individuals, with courage, determination, and passions. They begin thinking about their legacy, and their future.Triple Zero isn't the most exciting story (undercover work), but the story idea is neat... the life and times of the clone army. I look forward to reading the first, and future books in this series."
2,Too much detail,"Triple Zero I found to be too detailed in its development of Mandalorian culture, from customs and traditions to language. When the book needs a glossary to explain a whole extra lanuage, I find it annoying. I had a very had time staying interested in the book due to entire chapters that seemed to promote the author's agenda of Clone/Mandalorian culture. I can reference a Star Wars Technical guide for a that."
1,emerson jug kettle EM83691,"This product is a bigdisappointment...both my sister and myself purchased the Emerson Jug Kettle, hers lasted two weeks, mind two uses...l would like to have the address of Emerson so l might return it to them...but, l cannot find one !!!!"
4,Fast walk w/ belt,"I purchased this a couple of years ago at Target for half the price, I don't know how much it is at other places, but I've seen it cheaper. The 2 separate miles are awesome workouts. The classic walk is fast, but not nearly as fast as the other 2 mile fast walk. The weight belt is a great addition and when you take it off at the end you really do feel the difference. My only complaint is that after several months of use, one of the buckles snapped. I can still wear the belt, I just have to be careful and not have it real tight. Otherwise this is a really great workout, thanks Leslie!!"
3,little pricey,I bought an identical product from Walmart for $19.99. Leslie Sansone's exercise program is excellent by itself. It's just sold here at a double price.
2,Walk off more weight review,Fast mile workout works fine. The regular 2 mile workout skips and I cannot use it. Boosted walk is okay. I do like weighted belt.
4,A Good Workout without the Belt,"I like this workout; I use it as a 4-miler without the belt, as the belt really made my back hurt. I can take the belt apart to use it for ankle weights, so it is not wasted. This DVD doesn't have the option of doing both workouts together, so you have to keep walking at the end of either until you can bring up the main menu again, which really is no big deal.Leslie is by herself in this workout and you have a choice of a 2-mile classic workout or a 2-mile fast workout. They are both good workouts.Leslie Sansone Walk Off Even More Weight DVD Set with Belt"
3,eclectic collection,"What we have here is an eclectic collection,a grab-bag,something for just about anyone...And,given the various performances,there is as much drek as there is gold...Jay Ungar(of Ashokan Farewell fame)contributes several cuts,all of which are gems...John Sebastian(of the Lovin'Spoonful)on the other hand drops a few bombs ,his contributions weighing down the whole,and serving as an unwelcome contrast to the other,better performances...Ungar stays within his genre,which is one reason why he consistently delivers big,while Sebastian,adrift since his last big splash,the theme song from the 1970s teevee sitcom""Welcome Back Kotter"",attempts REAL folk(as opposed to the pop folk-rock which he did better when he was lead writer and singer of the spoonful,back in the swinging sixties),and is not quite up to the task...Eric Weissberg's contributions are stellar,while the Blakes(Norman & Nancy)are probably an aquired taste..."
5,Awesome rose essence :) will buy again,Really good smell. Authentic rose water. Use with sandalwood powder on face for baby soft skin :)will buy again
5,"True ""Rose Water""!",I use this product to moisturize my skin. I also like to spray my linens with this before ironing. The fragrence is long lasting. Some of the products on the market that you can find are artificial and the fragrance does not last.
1,.....,"The item arrived and my husband and I could not understand what the awful smell was in our house. Needless to say, when I opened the box, the water had leaked out of the bottle. This rose water smells awful and does not do anything but make your face smell bad. I will not be purchasing again. Disappointed!"
1,STINKY AWFUL,I do not know how this product is made or whether or not it has anything to do with roses. It certainly smells NOTHING like roses. Who knows what it is? I feel badly cheated and will never order it again.
2,Not for me,"It was not at all helpful to my skin. I am a person that used to look for answers to skin problems and this was not it. I found my answer but, it is not Rosewater. This sits under my sink and maybe i'll mix it with my Indian clay or something. May work for some but, not me."
4,"Meh, its water...","I was so excited to receive my rose water. I'd never used it before. I was planning on putting it on my hair (mixing it with my hair products).It really does smell good. I would say soooort of like roses lol. And it made my hair smell really good.But all in all, its just water. I just bought some nice smelling water lol. And I knew that from the beginning, but its all so special until you get it. Nice product."
1,Company has been sold -- no good anymore,"This is no longer manufactured by Heritage House -- it's now manufactured by something called ""Seychelles Organics, Inc."" and it's no good anymore. There's no rose scent whatsoever -- it's just plain water. Do yourself a favor and don't spend money on this now. It's just like plain spring water in a spray bottle. Very disappointing."
1,Beware this is not real rose water!,"I bought this rose water because of the good reviews but I was shocked when I saw the ingredients and actually smelled the product. There is nothing natural about it. It doesn't smell like rose water and it doesn't feel like rose water.It was big disappointment and waste of money.I use real steam distilled rose water on a daily bases, so I know how it smells. The real rose water I buy has only one ingredient and that is steam distilled flower water. The Heritage Rose Water is not supposed to be called rose water at all. I have very sensitive skin and would not use this questionable product on my face."
4,Great Product,"Great product I use it in my hair. Its healthy and it smells wonderful too. Between you and I, I've used it as a quickie perfume too. In that capacity it's not an all day thing but the first couple of hours got me complements."
5,Looooooove it,"I always wanted to add rose water to my skin care routine and am so glad I found this on amazon, is a great toner and for a great price."
5,Smells great!,"This rosewater smells exactly like what it's supposed to, but it's not powdery at all. I use it as a toner after oil cleansing my face. I want to put it in my spritzer bottle next."
5,This is the only toner I will put on my face,"I have the most sensitive skin in the world...I break out in rashes if I use something new to the point it looks like I have some sort of disease. It's really terrible. But this stuff is great. I love the smell of it, I completely trust the ingredients, it doesn't dry out my skin...it's one of my beauty products I can't live without. If you have sensitive skin, or acne, or anything like that, try this stuff as a toner. I put it on when I get out of the shower and then apply moisturizer. You will love it!"
5,Bliss in a Bottle,"I have tried a couple of other rose waters over the years, and never quite thought much of the fragrance. Recently someone suggested rose water to me again, so I went to Whole Foods and found this stuff. The fragrance and the simplicity of the formulation has grabbed me. There is a depth to the fragrance that I did not notice in the other 2 brands. I keep coming back to this for my face, as a base for moisturizing, and as a finisher after I have ""made up."" I spray this in my son's hair. I use it on my body, and on the linens. The fragrance reminds me of my dear Nonnie's heritage roses, and has been a hopeful uplift during these last lingering days of winter. I can only hope that the mag vortexed water that carries the scent is subtly working wonders on my skin. My DH raises an eyebrow at this, but I don't care. I am glad that someone out there is forward thinking, and I like thinking about the possibilities for goodness that this water brings to my daily life."
3,Personal Video Recorder,"Not as expected, display window not very clear and program not user friendly. Had difficulty programming TV channels and recording is very cumbersome."
1,Dissapointed,"I'm a tech kind of guy and was very dissapointed with the output quality of this card. In doing a lot of research, I've come to the conclusion that this is to be expected from the technology at this point. I'm going to wait a few months and see what the new trend and possibilities are. Anyway, I returned it."
1,Unsatisified,Could not get the item to work in any of our computers. They are all running WIn XP Pro with media center. The item was returned for a full refund.
5,Great Capture Board!,"This card is hardware encoding capture board, so it works great even with my old computer. Picture Quality is good! I record a lot of children's program and enjoing them with my daughter now.Highly recommended."
4,Simple to use - great tuner,"I bought this tuner after having installed an ATI based tuner in my home built MCE 2005 system. I am trying to move from DirecTV back to good old antenna reception and found the ATI could not tune one of the basic networks in my area, yet my $100 TV could.After reading that this unit had a good tuner I decided to give it a try and am pleased to see that it does a much better job on that one channel. Obviously a higher quality tuner.On the encoding side I might have to agree with others that it does show a little more artifiacting than the ATI but not enough to bother me.Just buy the thing already."
1,The worst piece of hardware I've had. Stay away don't waste your money,My Asus M2NPV-VM motherboard sees it but it doesn't work at all. I've read a lot of bad reviews and they say the same.
2,Watch out if you have Windows XP,"This is a good price, put watch out if you don't have Windows MCE, despite what the description says. I had to down load drivers and software to get it working. I'm still debuggin it. Performance is poorer than the previouw version of this card that I had and I still don't have the radio working well. The response of the interface is very slow, especially channel changes. Not recommended for Windows XP users."
2,No good for Windows XP PRO,"Purchase this to convert my VHS tapes to DVD. My decision to purchase was based on reviews and that it can be used on Windows XP Pro. I had a hard time loading it. Spent a lot time looking for downloads on the internet. Tried to contact customer service and that was a joke. Finally got it to work and then I was very disappointed with the software that came with it. In my opinon, the enclosed software is useless when it comes to capturing VHS videos. I gave it a 2 star rating because someone with Windows Media edition may find this product useful. Returned the product and purchased AverMedia DVD EZmaker Gold. It works great and it is cheaper."
1,Don't buy this!,"This only work if you have Windows Media Center or Vista Home Premium installed. I bought the white box unit because of the FM tuner but I couldn't use it and is taking space on my PC. The software is not available on the Internet, so I don't know how I could use this.Before you buy it, make sure you have the software or buy it."
2,Get wintv-pvr-1800 mce instead,"I have Vista Home Premium. Tried this unit but Vista drivers weren't that easy to install. Got WinTV-PVR-1800 MCE model 1128 with remote instead (which I will give 5 stars). Plugged in card to PCIx1 slot. IR blaster into USB. Turned PC on and VISTA automatically downloaded from web all drivers. I went to Windows Media Setup with Directv options and Svideo in. Awesome! Better than TIVO and does game and player tracking if into Fantasy leagues, etc. Using with ROXIO 10 very successfully, but ROXIO will sometimes say ""no signal"" if you just used Windows Media Center. To resolve Log off/ Log on and it will be OK."
2,I don't get it,"This was really one of the worst romance novels I have read in a long, long, long, time. I can usually pick um but something was really wrong this time. It seems as if the author was following a romance novel outline and didn't take the time to make sure she had a good story. She jumped around from idea to idea, it was like she said ""okay there has to be danger, I'll put that here. Oh, I need the couple to have conflict, I'll put that here. Wait! the story is almost over, they need to make up real quick."" Honestly, I could not wait till the end of the book. I only finished it because I was at work for 12 hours and there was nothing else to do. If you love a great romance story that FLOWS, I could not recommend this to you."
3,TEMPTATION?,"I thought the book was good, even though it lacked one major ingredient, ROMANCE. Once Danita and Stuart realized they had real feelings for one another there was nothing there. Ms Carlysle could have made the story so much better if she had included the love scenes between the two, instead she leads the reader to the bedroom door and shuts it, until the next morning.There was a great plot going on but the reader is mainly left hanging, wanting more. I gave it 3 stars for potential. It is a quick read but not all that exciting. At least it has a happy ending."
4,Main shoe,"Found these at Sears several years ago and have not looked back. I've gone from a 9-1/2 to a ten for better comfort and I've tried to find a different brand but these keep working for me. They last about four months - the laces and the bottoms wear out at about the same time.Usually buy two pair at a time if available and will be very bummed if they are ever discontinued. I wear them at work, for play and hiking.I wish they would last longer and it was easier to clean the dog poo from the lugs (we have dogs)."
3,"Good shoe for walking, bad for running","I bought this shoe bacause I have a wide foot and this was one of the few shoes I could get online at 12EEE. The sneaker is very comfortable for walking. It is terrible for running though, my feet would really hurt after running in these shoes. If you are going to do any running DON'T BUY THIS SHOE! Otherwise, I think its a very good sneaker."
1,Poor Service,"If you have any trouble with these shoes Sketchers will not stand behind their product. You will not be easily supported nor will you get a replacement/coupon/reimbursement for or towards another pair of shoes. I had a pair of sketchers that started falling apart after a week. The store would not take the worn shoes back and told me to contact Sketchers. So I did, and sent along pictures for their inspection. I was told that I would have to ship them in at my cost, with delivery confirmation because they are not responsible for packages and they would deem them to either be intentionally damaged or a manufacturing defect. Their Customer service reps are rude, and short and offered me no other options."
3,Comfortable shoes,"I bought these for my husband after a lot of searching for hikers. He found them comfortable for shorter periods of time. They're weren't an ""all day"" wear shoe."
4,great walking shoe,"I find this shoe to be perfect for walking. I clock an average 7 miles a day on uneven ground. The sole is very comfortable, and the heel support is perfect to alleviate side to side movement. This is my 3rd pair of this shoe. I hope they keep making them......"
4,Book Two in the Cooper and Fry Series,"Format: Audio Cassette BookNarrated by Terry Wale.2002 Barry Award winner for Best British Crime Novel, set in the Peak District, where neolithic stones called the Nine Virgins stand on Ringham Moor. A circle of stones where a woman is found dead by a young park ranger one late fall afternoon. This is the second attack in this area. The first had resulted in the disfigurement and loss of memory of the victim.Meanwhile Ben Cooper, who has family problems of his own to deal with and recent incomer Diane Fry are both set to work on different aspects of the case. Ben is tested by asking himself what is justice and the role of the policeman, Diane has a more pragmatic view.As usual Booth's characters are at the center of the mystery. Very good police procedural. Recommended.Terry Wale does an ok job as narrator. He's not great but competent.Prior book in the series isBlack DogFollowing book isBlood on the Tongue"
5,Fantastic Book!,"This book is awesome! It explains so well that people do not *need* blood transfusions that so much can be done without them and in fact if a person makes the choice not to have a blood transfusion they may get better care, more skilled care. Too many times physicians have resorted to giving unnecessary blood transfusions instead of using their skills and this has led to numerous diseases, not just AIDS but many other often fatal diseases. Buy this book."
2,It doesn't say anthing that isn't already obvious ...,"I felt that I knew very little about customer service, which is why I bought this book. However, I was disappointed because it does not really say anything I couldn't have figured out myself. It seems to outline customer service in a very lengthy manner, without specifically addressing/fixing any problems.I have found other customer service books that are much more useful."
3,don't read this without your prayerbook next to you,"This book was certainly useful for what it is - a rather dry laundry list of High Holy day prayers and explanations of same. If you have the prayerbook next to you while reading Hammer's book, you can get a brief explanation of each prayer and its context from the latter- certainly a worthwhile task. But I don't think you would get much out of this learned but less-than-lively book otherwise, and I also think Max Arzt's Justice and Mercy (which Hammer, to his credit, cites) covered the same material in much more detail some decades ago."
3,Nice shoes.,"These shoes were a gift and I have been told that they seemed a bit small at first, they actually fit well after a breaking-in time. They have the colors and look that allows them to be worn anytime as well as game time."
1,poorly written,"While I agree that Lynn Hill may be an inspiration to many women climbers, I felt that the book was very poorly written. I also concur and can not understand how this book achieved a rating of 5 and 6 stars. It highlights some events of Lynn's climbing in her lifetime but it doesn't capture the soul of climbing. I also felt some arrogance with her writing where most of the writing were concentrated on the negatives of others' climbs while in some instances she had the same. Overall I wouldn't recommend this book to a beginner or a inspirational women's climb."
1,Not Received yet,I did not receive my product yet.Please have a look where was stopped my order.Regards// Laurent Garnier
2,"disappointing, at best","As a woman and a rock climber, I looked forward to reading this book. Unfortunately, it is so poorly written, much is left to be desired. The majority of the book skims over events that deserved more attention (i.e. Hill's involvement in European climbing competition) while using her love life as filler. I still respect Hill greatly and was awed by the color photos of her climbing, but a good editor and more introspective on Hill the climber and not Hill the dating machine would have done this book wonders."
2,Did I read the same book?,"I'm a little baffled by the previous reviews because I don't see how this book rates 5 stars. As a climber, I think Lynn Hill is a role model to look up to but as a reader, I could barely get through the pages. Also, this may seem like nit-picking but for the record, dinosaurs were never caught in the La Brea tar pits since the fossils recovered here are only roughly 30,000 years old."
2,Documentation Ripoff,"This book has way too much information that is already available from the documentation help files or online.I would preferred to see real world examples of when caching was implemented and how they tackled real problems. The sample code snippets they provide are basic knowledge and are available in the documentation.This book should be called ""Asp.Net and Ado tutorial with a shallow chapter on asp.net caching."""
3,ASP.NET tuning,Quite an old book but a lot of the content still has relevance to systems and practices using tools around today. Have picked up quite a few tips for tuning ASP.NET both from a coding and infrastructure perspective.
5,How can you NOT love Bis?,"Sure, it's short, but it's only 5 bucks, go for it! Bis is the freshest, most amazing stuff I've heard in a long time, cathy and energetic. It's certainly more than worthwhile, so go for it!"
5,Looking for a new sound...?,"Than Bis will definitely satisfy your craving. Upbeat & catchy music presented in a new way. Every song by this clever trio is refreshing & wonderful - once you let their sound infect you. Warning: Bis may take some getting used to but since this album is 5+1/2 bucks, i recommend giving them a shot. Its a great, tasty tid-bit of their energized sound."
4,This is powerful music alright,"This should be just about everyone's introduction to the group Bis. The first major-release compiling singles of theirs. The songs are excellent. The lyrics are intelligent and thought-provoking, the sound is pop and punk mixing quite intimately, and the songs themselves are incredibly infectious. And you know after hearing this that there's more to come. But, you never how how amazing this band really is until you've seen all that they can do."
2,Somewhat disapointed,This book was photocopied from an original book. Some of the print was hard to read. I would look elsewhere

5,"beautiful collage of sounds for body, soul and brain","rarley do you find music that you can went insane on the dance floor or contemplate on your bus ride to home/work or just stare at the wall wondering how this talented artists made such great and groundbraking music that layed the foundation of music to come. I only came in contact with their music recently and what i heard is familiar sounds from bands whose music i love, like ESG, Gang of Four, PiL, and bands that came years after them but were probably influenced by them like !!!, LCD and many more..."
4,Loved it!,"I got this elmo for a baby shower gift and just loved it!! It was the first gift I had received with the babies name on it, It was a hit with me for sure!!"
4,Valentines day gift,"Ordered this to Australia for my boyfriend for Valentines Day (hes 20!!) and its is the most gorgeous thing, I can't wait to give it to him!"
1,Elmo!,"My little brother, TOMMY got this for his second birthday, but the dumb company that made Elmo messed his name up and made him say ""Tammy!"" We got another Elmo, but he keeps thinking my brother's a darn girl!!! SOMEONE GIVE THAT MONSTER A BRAIN!!!!!!!!!!"
3,A little disappointing....,"After reading Dopefiend (5 stars), I expected Never Die Alone to be just as good. Unforetunately, it wasn't. And it was also too short. Nevertheless, it was still a good read."
4,REDRUM!! REDRUM!!,"Murder in reverse, thankfully this is a thin book because I really NEEDED to get to the end and find out what happens in this story of murder told in flashbacks based on the diary of King David. King David was no nobleman. The only time he attempted to right his severe wrongs, it resulted in the shanking that ended his life. dont be mad I didnt give it away, there is a picture of a corpse on the cover for goodness sakes!ok, I'll give you a hint, there is no point in hoping the events will change- the main character does not make it :)"
3,"Informative and thorough, but dull and British","If this is the book I think it is, it's sub-titled ""August 1985"". The authors are General Sir John Hackett ""and other top-ranking NATO generals and advisors"". Anyone who's familiar with British scholars or military officers knows how they love to belabor one with details. These authors are no exception. Half the book is spent on the build up before a shot is even fired, and the entire book is written in the format of a college history text 2 years after the war. While one can appreciate the incredible depth and development the authors have given to the events in their future history (the novel was written in 1979) it is undeniably slow by American standards. If you are the type of person who likes war documentaries, likes the technical believability of Clancy, and reads the entire information plaque at a museum display, you will like this book. For anyone else, it will be a painful drag."
2,Poorly Communicated in Complex Long Sentences,"This book is written in what I would call complex, long, wordy sentences that communicate poorly. It almost seems to be so intellectual that few could understand it. It certainly is not my style. I prefer Ernest Hemingway who communicates so simply, so well and in as few words as possible. This book is the opposite."
4,A gritty view of Ireland,"Private investigators, that staple of American literature and criminal justice, do not exist in Ireland. The Irish will not tolerate informers. That leaves only fools--and drunks--to look into cases the Guard have closed or ignored. To the Irish, truth is not as important as silence.The Guards is at first glance a little tale with an anti-hero, but proves to be much more."
3,Book is great - Kindle formatting is awful,"I really liked this book - and began to LOVE the series when I started reading the second and third books. I feel like I really know the characters. Real dialogue and characters and moves at a great pace. HOWEVER - I am lazily purchasing these on Kindle even though (A) They are over priced and (B) The books were obviously scanned and not in any way proof read. The number of mistakes. mis-scanned words, badly formatted sentances is a disgrace. In places the main characters name is incorrectly printed. A real pity as it does take some of the enjoyment of reading the books away. If I could find hardcopy versions of these books I would purchase those instead."
4,"Great book, but the Kindle edition is riddled with typos.","I bought this book to read on a Kindle and hungrily devoured it and the next two books in the series. Dark, funny stuff.However, the number of typos in the Kindle editions of all three books has been ridiculous. They're not even mistakes a human would make... it seems as if they scanned a paperback with text recognition software and not one person ever bothered to read it. Some paragraphs are practically illegible. This is shockingly unprofessional for a publisher charging $9.99 per book."
4,Loved it!,"I've finally started the Jack Taylor series, after having come to Bruen through London Boulevard and Once Were Cops, and I'm hungry for anything I can get my hands on. If you're a fan of his spare yet powerful style of prose, The Guards will not disappoint."
2,Not My Cup of Guinness,"I didn't like this book very much. I found its minimalist style contrived, showy and offputting. The plot didn't amount to much and most of the book seemed to dwell on the protagonist's battle with the bottle. There was some good Irish local color and I enjoyed reading for once about an Irish city other than Dublin, namely Galway. But the book didn't hold my interest and I was glad when it was over."
4,tortured excellence,"As with all of Ken Bruen's mysteries, this is a dark tale with complicated characters who keep one turing the pages."
4,Best debut mystery of the year,"There's certainly no shortage of ""drunk P.I."" novels, yet somehow Bruen has created a completely compelling work.As a former member of an elite Irish police force, Jack Galway now whiles away his time nursing drinks in a pub. Despite his fall from grace, Jack is still known as a man with a skill for finding things. Enter the beautiful older woman (one of many cliches this book gets away with) with the missing daughter, and Jack's back in action. Inevitably, he has encounters with all sorts of seedy types, leading to a resolution that may not satisfy some readers.The story may not be original, but Bruen's writing more than makes up for it. A great read for fans of the P.I. novel, especially those who appreciate strong writing. Unfortunately, this book will likely be overlooked in favor of others, but for anyone interested it's definitely worth the time."
4,A Mystery by a Stand-out Writer,"Ken Bruen sure has a way with words. This book reminded me of Martin Amis's 'Night Train'. On the surface the writing seems minimalist but it is rich with characterization.What stands out is the nuance and sense of inner reflection juxtaposed with the Irish environment and sensibilities of Galway. The protagonist is a heavy drinker as so many private eyes in hard-boiled mysteries seem to be. This book examines the hunter and the hunted, the lost and the found. It is a good addition to the Jack Taylor series.I highly recommend this book. It is head and tails above the usual books in this genre."
4,From a professor's prespective,"I'm a professor at Yale, CT. Eng Lit and Journalism. I have just finished reading this book, and I can tell you I usually don't read sci-fi, but when one of my students told me about this book, I had to get it. I was amazed at the intrique, the storyline is solid. (few minor typos-oversights), however it in no way hurts the story.At first I thought all the details contained in this bountiful book was too much. However, when I finally got to the end, I was astonished beyond discription at the final disclosure, and why Garcia fomated her book this way. A great work of the masters when it comes to plots-like Rod Sterling, Hitchcock.I'm definitely recommending this book to everyone I know, not just my student. My 15year daughter is reading it now."
1,In desparate need of an editor,"Although there is promise of a good tale in the notes, this self-indulgent piece of tripe spirals ever downward until internal logic, grammar and spelling are all lost. Like a slow motion car wreck, this lame attempt is hideously facinating, but honestly, I've never read anything worse in my life."
4,A SCI-FI &#65533;Picket Fences&#65533;,"An excellent sci_fi thriller. I wanted to keep reading to find out what was going to happen next. The author made feel like you were living in the town and were experiencing what the townspeople going though. It was like a sci-fi ""Picket Fences"". Can't wait to read the sequel"
1,Verbose and pretentious,"The purpose of all truly good poetry is to reduce stress in readers or listeners, calming them both physically and emotionally. This has been proven in many scientific studies, but these poems only create more stress due to their subject matter, which is source of anxiety and tension for all but the luckiest of mortals. The filmmakers would have done better by their fellow man had they refrained from reprinting these misguided poems from an earlier, more insensitive era in our species' history."
4,excellent film,I would recommend this film to anyone who interested in the topic of street children. This film bodly represents the struggles of a young boy trying to find a place in a society that does not want him. There is much graphic nudity but I feel it is needed to capture the viewers attention and suck them into the world of the street child.
5,it was a differant movie but great price and came fast,"i saw this movie on another site and i had thought they were crazy for asking what they did, so i did like i always do i checked amazon, and sure enough i got a Great deal. thanks amazon you guys rock and it came pretty fast too."
2,Pixote,I thought that this movie was a real eye-opener! I didn't know that you could film child nudity/pornography. I thought that the basic plot of the street kids and reformitories was good. When it began to stray from the basic plot that is when I thought the movie went downhill. I would not recommend this movie to any of my friends. I would only recommend watching this if you are are very bored and want to expand your horizons about child sexuality.
3,"It's just ok, not worth the money","I am so surprised by all of the rave reviews! This bag is just simply, ok. The ""pleather"" has a cheap look and feel to it, and does not look even close to a $100++ bag. The bag however is a great size, and is comfortable to carry. I think I will end up keeping it for now, and continue looking for something nicer."
5,Great bag,I wanted a bag that would carry my really thin laptop like it belonged in it and not have the round straps that 90% of the laptop bags do. I was not disappointed. I have owned Targus bags in the past that ten years later still look new and this one looks to be up to that challenge as well. Months later and I am still thrilled with my purchase.
5,Elegant and functional.,Edit: 12/11 - I am still using this bag six years later! It has held up very well.The Targus Deluxe Tote was well worth the investment. It has ample storage pockets and a nice central slot to keep my laptop secure.
3,"Basic advice, not enlightening, recipes are fussy...","The aim is good, but this book doesn't hit it; there's a little simple science but then it jumps into advice that doesn't have supporting detail. The bullet points are either obvious, things most cooks already know, or somewhat dubious generalizations (many apples do not brown when cut). I haven't found a recipe I'd use, almost all call for ingredients I don't normally have (and I already make a nice brined roast turkey).The answer to why you should never cook a Vidalla onion; actually, it's just that they cost more and cooked aren't any better than regular onions. But often my sweet onions are ready in the garden earlier in spring, so I don't see why I can't cook with them."
5,love this book!,"Purchased this for my daughter. She loves it. She is a budding chemist and loves to cook, right up her alley. I also started reading it (when I can get it away from my girl) and find it VERY interesting. I am not a budding chemist, hated science in school-probably should of had books like this!Came in a timely manner in better than advertised condition! Yay!"
5,The Physics of Food made easy,"I heard an interview with the author on an NPR station and knew I had to have this book. If you have ever wondered why one ingredient just clumps up in your sauce & another works to thicken it and a bunch of other cooking questions, get this book. The writing is fun to read, and the information is invaluable to anyone who'd like to know why culinary ingredients combine and cook the way they do.He discusses everyday normal cooking, this isn't about esoteric or unusual foods, he de-mystifies alot of very ordinary cooking methods. Has lots of recipies also, illustrating the information in each section. Must have for interested cooks."
2,Good start but it runs out of steam,I now know more about cooking fries than I suspected there was to learn. If he covered other cooking topics in such detail this would be a fine book. As it is there are several better beginning kitchen science books.
2,If you are a home-cookin' kind of person...,"...don't buy this book. The recipes are too gourmet for someone who is looking for simpler recipes. There are some interesting scientific tidbits in the book, but I was not impressed at all with the recipes. Glad I only spent a buck on it through one of the used book sellers on Amazon."
5,"I'll Read It, But I Won't Eat It","It's telling that Russ Parsons titles his book with the one food that's on virtually no one's diet: The French Fry. Now that the forbidden fruit has got my attention, I am deep frying myself in this compendium. I read all the food science books and get something from each one, but I like Parsons' way of putting things. For example, he entitles a chapter ""fat, flour, and fear,"" the fear relating to failure or perhaps a piecrust. This is smart, because this kind of thing happens. Food science helps, with a good dose of hands-on experience. As Parsons tells us: ""The only way to learn how to make a good piecrust is to make enough bad ones..."" Of course, we knew that already, but it helps seeing it repeated in a science context. Applying the science is the key.Food writer Elliot Essman's other reviews and food articles are available at www.stylegourmet.com"
4,great jumping off point,This book has helped me be more imaginative in inventing my own recipes. It has also helped me understand why I failed in other recipes. THe recipes included in the book are not very interesting however.
1,How to read a subtitle.,"If you buy this item based on its subtitle, don't bother. I bought this for the library and the faculty hoping that it would help them prepare interesting labs (and perhaps tasty ones). There isn't much in the way of science. I recall having tripped over books in the past which actually do discuss the science of food and cooking. This one falls short. The fact there is no bibliography doesn't help me recall those titles which really did set out to discuss the science of food."
1,Clever but not accurate,"If you are looking for a cutesy book with no actual food science merit, then buy this arrogant book!"
4,different perspective,"I am a female who enjoys watching boxing fights. This book was an interesting read because it's a different perspective on the so-called heavyweight champions of boxing. It's a sole person's take on outstanding, memorable fights based on his personal statistical system. This to me was an interesting way to look at the sport and it's outcome.Read the book, you'll be presently surprised at the author's take on each boxer and some of the greatest fights."
5,For home bakers with big dreams,"I was going to take a Pastry 101 class at the local culinary institute...And then I found this book.Impeccably organized into chapters featuring master recipes that build up to many of the big classic desserts, I think this book is as educational for the home baker as any class would be.All the directions are clear, all the steps are explained well, and the recipes are structured so that it is easy to improviseyour own creations---if you learn to make a firm ganache, then learn to make raspberry puree, and learn to make pate sucree---suddenly you can design and create your own chocolate raspberry tart.If you are interested in the science and techniques of baking and you are ready for the tools to become a creative pastry chef (at least in your own home), this is the book for you!"
4,Wonderful collection,"Some suggest that for the ""expert"" baker this book does not deliver. Well, if you are an ""expert"" baker, I eagerly await YOUR book, so get to work.I am no expert, far from that. Despite my lack of experience I have been able to produce some darn fine quality work using the recipes and techniques in this book. I have made things I never would have imagined, my understanding has improved greatly.I have no quibbles with the ""volume vs weight"" measurements. I understand the arguments. I use both. Sherry uses both.There seem to be a few gaps here and there in the basic technique areas, but when I ask my in-house advisor I'm told ""well, EVERYONE knows THAT"" Oh. Now I know too.No other book has motivated me to want to create such wonderful desserts for my family, and I now do so with regularity."
5,I cannot tell you how much I loved this book!!!!!,"I made silky smooth Creme' Brulee from this book before I even set foot in Culinary School. I also made the cream puffs, and the pastry cream (which in general is tricky to make) like a pro.I even used this book to study from when I took my finals."
2,"Not straightforward, and not all recipes come out","I found this book to be a great letdown. Flipping back and forth between ""master"" recipes and the actual thing you want to make is annoying and might lead to errors. I made the Lemon Pound Cake (so-so) and the Baumkuchen (which bore no resemblance to cake when finished.) I wrote twice to the publisher asking for help with the Baumkuchen. On the second request, the publisher wrote back, apologized for the non-response, and said Ms. Yard might or might not get back to me. Better alternatives for people who want to make great desserts that do not disappoint are the Nancy Silverton books, the new Gourmet collection, or the Collette books. Or even Martha Stewart--but not this."
1,So disappointed,"I ordered this book over one year ago because of the rave reviews. I tried two recipes in it. The lemon pound cake was dense, too lemony and just all around not to my or my boyfriend's liking. The vanilla cupcakes were so, so. I make exceptional desserts from recipes in other books and articles and people have raved about them. I also follow instructions precisely. However, in this case I know that the recipes are not good (at least to me) and the baker is not the problem. I guess I just don't have a taste for the recipes in this book. I am almost afraid to try another recipe because the two others have been so disappointing.Perhaps this book is for someone who has different tastes from the norm. However, I like decadent desserts. So far I'm thoroughly disappointed and wished I hadn't purchased the book."
2,Highly overrated,"I ordered this book because the ratings were so good - and I love baking. This book did not match my expectations: Recipes are too complicated and way too european. Usually after getting a new book I don't know what should be the first recipe I bake. This problem does not occur, there is nothing I would like to try.Nevertheless, it is interesting to read..."
1,worst physics book ever,"this book is not physics, it is a literature book. nothing is explained well. the author says that introductory physics background is enough to understand this book . it is not true !!!!! it is very hard to understand the book if you dont have a background in quantum and modern physics. it doesn't have deep math, but it is not explained well either!!!get away from this book , even if your instructor recommend it!!"
2,Good sports magazine for skim reading,"ESPN magazine is good for skim reading. If you are looking for in-depth articles that present new ideas then look towards Sports Illustrated. ESPN magazine features many short articles about current, and upcoming events in sports. Most of the content in each issues can be written by a couple of interns, but within each issue are one or two lengthy article that maybe worth reading. Otherwise, this magazine is great to read in the bathroom, or during breakfast. I subscribed ESPN magazine because I wanted a cheap magazine that provided an overview into sports. For those more serious about sports, upgrade and spend the extra money on Sports Illustrated.Pros- Cheap- ESPN InsiderCons- Articles lack quality- Many Ads"
3,Nothing Special,"It has a lot of Pictures. I guess that's good. There are a usually a few good articles but overall it's no Sports Illustrated. It just seems like there are too many articles that are very unintesting to me. The only reason I got it was because it was a lightning deal 2 year subscription for $15. So if you can get it for a little more than a quarter an issue, go for it. I would be hard pressed to pay much more."
1,Don't get this magazine!,"I signed my husband up for a free year of ESPN magazine. I thought the sports fanatic would love it. Wrong! He hated the magazine. In fact, he told me to not get him this magazine again, even if it was free!!"
2,Great if your attention span is less than 30 seconds,"I purchased this magazine solely to get cheaper access to ESPN Insider Online. The magazine is so all over the place otherwise that its hardly worth reading. Its chock full of tidbits that barely gloss over sports topics. I keep it in my bathroom and I guess its good there when I only have a few minutes to read while brushing my teeth or whatnot. Don't expect SI-type depth though, its full of ads and slick factoid type departments. Reading this magazine is like watching Sportscenter, a lot of many little things with no depth on anything. I guess its worth it for less than 60 cents an issue, but if I sat down to read this magazine cover to cover I would be done with it totally in under 15 minutes....enjoy."
2,Lacking substance,"I switched to ESPN The Magazine from Sports Illustrated because I wanted an Insider membership on their website, and I figured I'd try something new. Now I am regretting it. The majority of the content is lame random facts and top ten lists. The few articles longer than a paragraph are hard to find between all the ads, and they lack substance and anything to entice the reader to keep reading. This magazine feels more like teen magazine with all the gaudy headlines and lack of any real reporting or journalism. If you want a magazine with interesting and insightful sports articles, beautiful photos, and 1/100th of the advertisements, get a subscription to sports illustrated. This magazine is lame."
3,Hard for this mag to compete with its TV Big Brother!,"It is a fairly BIG magazine, not your normal size by any means, so it will take a lot of space. It is entertaining to some degree and has some articles that I found interesting. The thing that kept from giving it 5 stars is that in today's world and with ESPN, ESPN 2, ESPN NEWS, ESPN CLASSIC and more available in my TV, why should I keep this subscription? Almost everything in it, you will have seen already in the TV. If you like reading magazines, go ahead, as for me, I canceled the subscription because I didn't see a point in getting old news on the mail."
1,Sucks,"This has got to be the worst sports magazine out there. The articles aren't worth reading. Avoid this magazine, even if it was free!"
1,ESPN the mag is hard to read,"Only reason to buy this is the insider access on ESPN.com. This goes straight in the trash. If you have to read it, take some aspirin!"
1,Horrible refund process,"This was bought as a present. However, within three days, I found out that the intended recipient had just purchased the subscription as well. I canceled the subscription before the first magazine had even been sent out and I only got a refund of $0.96."
3,Still waiting,Haven't received the first issue yet. But I'm sure my husband will love it when ever it comes in. :-)
1,My subscription was cancelled by ESPN after one issue and I was not reimbursed.,"I ordered this magazine for a year at $5 during a special at Xmas time here at Amazon. I then went ahead and added an additional year for another $5. I received one issue, and then noticed that my subscription had been cancelled! I wrote them and was reimbursed only 96 cents of that total $10. So it cost $9 for that one issue and I'm still waiting on them to get back to me. I want the subscription reinstated, but I don't know what they (ESPN) will do now. To me, this is a blatent ripoff and not the way customers should be treated. Be very careful with this magazine..."
3,Friend purchased subscription prior,Already receiving a subscription for this magazine as a holiday gift. Therefore giving a score if difficult though I do like your product.
5,Bought it for Insider,"Like most subscribers, I bought it for Insider (cheaper than subscribing online). That said, how can I not love it?"
5,ESPN a hit!,"I gave this to my son as a stocking stuffer and he loved it! He's a huge sports fan, and said the magazine was awesome. He even received his first copy two days before Christmas, when I didn't expect him to get it until the week between Christmas and New Years. With a year's subscription for only $5.00, everybody was happy!"
2,11 month Insider,"When I immediately signed up for Insider which was the only reason I subscribed, it indicated only 11 months left for Insider."
5,Sent as a gift,"We bought this for a gift for our 16 year old ""little brother"" and he was estactic! It was a great gift because it keeps him reading but he doesn't realize it! He just thinks that he's finding out ""cool"" things in the sports world."
3,ESPN as a gift,Recipient really likes the sports articles but doesn't like that the advertising and advertising photos overpower the magazine.
4,ESPN magazine,This was a Christmas gift for my 14 year old stepson who's a sports enthusiast. I would say this is age appropriate as well as entertaining for a teenage boy that already loves everything about ESPN. Great price and great gift idea for teens that are hard to buy for - they will look forward to the mail every month!
1,Horrible experience,"The magazine is awful, but really, it's ESPN and I dont expect much from them to start with. The main reason I purchased a subscription was for ESPN Insider which seemed to have a decent group of writers like Eric Karabell and Christopher Harris. However when I attempted to go through the process of activating my Insider account, ESPN said I did not have an active subscription. When I read off my 10 digit number to the phone rep, they said that number was not active and I would have to contact the magazine company to see what is going on.Needless to say I dont have the patience to spend an hour or so on the phone with a sales rep getting yanked around being told I need to contact Amazon and then ESPN and then the magazine company. I canceled after one issue, good riddance. I will never subscribe again."
2,Good and Bad,"This magazine is edgy, and it does stuff that most sports magazines don't do. It has unusual angles to it's sports stories: it's really quite different from S.I., or Sports Illustrated. That's good and bad. Also, this thing is absolutely JAM PACKED with ads. Four and five full pages in a row of full page ads. It's just crazy. More ads than a cosmo magazine.I got it on sale for five dollars for five months, so like fifty cents per issue. And that's about all it's worth."
4,ESPN Insider,"Like others have said, I only got this for the espn insider. It is way cheaper getting it on here instead of paying 40 a year on the espn website. I am not a fan of the magazine itself. It is basically like going to the website and clicking links randomly and reading whatever comes up. The articles are made for people with no attention span. They have changed recently to make the magazine have an overall theme. I am still not a fan personally of it but I am glad they are trying to change from the originally feeling that it is just random articles slammed together in a magazine. The espn insider is the real value. They have exclusive articles everyday and I enjoy the rumor part of the website that is updated a few times a day. It is worth getting if you follow sports on the internet and like having up to date information daily. You need your customer magazine number to log in on the website."
4,"ESPN Insider is great, the mag....",So I got this on special for $5 for a 1 year subscription. I got the mags delivered tomy house but practically never read them. For starters the size of the magazine is too big. I feel like it's all about pictures and much less about substantial content. But the ability to have access to insider on espn.com made it all worth while! The articles on insider and the information is practically all great! Now that my subscription has ended and I don't have access to insider it really stinks. I will most likely renew this just for insider. But next time I will either forgo the actual magazine (they have this option but it's the exact same price as getting it delivered (shows you how much they care about the acutal magazine) or get it delivered to my work so people there can read during lunch.
1,Not Magazine-sized!,"Wouldn't have ordered if I'd known this wasn't really a magazine. Pages are very thin, and the publication itself is a big, floppy, messy-looking leaflet. You cannot stack this with regular magazines. It's a ""magazine"" like Parade in the Sunday paper is a magazine."
1,Get ready to wait,"I would look at getting your magazines from another website. The description says 4-6 weeks, but I placed my order on March 8 with an estimated first magazine of May 2--more like 7-9 weeks. Or is that 4-6 weeks to send my subscription to ESPN? This is what happens when you try to save a couple of dollars by not going straight to the source. If my first ESPN magazine actually arrives by May 2, I will give them back a star."
3,You do know why I get this mag?,"I only order this to get espn insider for the website. It's nice to have it show up in my mailbox once a month, but really the value is in getting espn insider. Without it I'm not sure I would order."
4,Got the first issue fast!,It didn't take long to get the first issue. The mag is not too bad and it looks like a easy read.
2,Two much ads.,This book contains tooooo much ads. even the ads. is more than the articles. I really do not like this. I think is must why it is that cheap.
3,Came later than promised.,"Content in the actual magazine sucks. Worth the $5 I paid for insider access online, although ESPN could make it harder to consume or RSS, but I'm not sure how."
1,No insider,ESPN will make you put in a credit card number to get access to the insider service even after you get your first magazine.
3,Decent magazine,I got this subscription for my husband since he's such a sports buff but its pretty much the same as the channel.
2,Magazine is awful but free insider makes it worthwhile,The magazine itself isn't very interesting. There are relatively few articles and the authors are definitely second notch. But it does come with free insider and if you get it on sale then it's worth the price.
1,Poor quality magazine,"ESPN magazine pales in comparison to Sports Illustrated. I read SI cover to cover in one setting as soon as I get it. The ESPN writing is poor, articles are uninteresting and the overall experience of the magazine is lacking. They should stick with what they know--gouging the cable subscribers and monopolizing US major sports via TV."
2,Why the price hike?!,"When I purchased this subscription last year it was ****5***** (with no auto-renewal requirement). Now, I go back to purchase it for my father in law and it's 26 bucks? I mean, I get a small price increase... but 5 times the price? Though, I did buy it again because he loved the magazine. So 5 stars for the magazine, but 1 star for the price jump."
3,Great Mag. Poor service.,"I purchased this for my hubby for a present. There was no way to contact them when I realized it would arrive in my name to change it. I have 2 teenage sons who love this magazine look forward to its arrival. Its a large magazine and they enjoy the large pics to use for their rooms. However with it being a large magazine and going through the mail with absolutely no protection, it does not always arrive in grand condition."
4,Good sports magazine,I enjoy reading ESPN The Magazine because it has different articles for different people. Informative and good layouts. Interesting facts as well and stories. The Magazine is a bit bigger than your regular magazine off the rack but its a must for any sports fan. Specially any sports fan who watches ESPN.
4,ESPN,Great Magazine! Bought subscription for a Christmas present and received our first issue before Christmas. You gotta love that. Thanks Amazon.
2,uninspired,"Let me qualify this review by saying that I bought ESPN Magazine because I wanted access to their INsider website, which was similarly priced on its own.That said, I received my first issue this week....and it had already been on newsstands for a couple of weeks already. Maybe that will change and I'll receive my next issue very soon, but I'm not keeping my hopes up.The magazine itself lives up to its reputation of being entirely uninspired. A couple of the stories were moderately interesting, but not in-depth enough to provide any real journalistic value. The magazine attempts to cover the entire sports scene in the US (and abroad too), which is a rather lofty goal that ends up watering down some of their coverage. My interest is really only in a handful of sports, so I don't like that, but I can see why others would."
3,Informative but BORING!,"I purchased this book because it was a required text for a Contract Law class. Although Contract Law isn't an intriguing subject, this textbook was written in a manner that would put you to sleep...which I did several times. The information in the text was useful. The manner in which it reads could have been a little more straightforward."
3,Contracts in a Nutshell,"When I bought this book, I thought I was buying the title ""Government Contracts in a Nutshell. However what I rec'd was ""Contracts in a Nutshell"" and this is not at all the book I needed. I am very disappointed and don't know what my options are for returns. Any help?"
4,A good entry to a 1Ls Kindle Collection,"The price is right, the book is formatted correctly and includes hyperlinks to chapters and topics within chapters. The material is on par with the other commercial outline/study aids I've used or seen. For a law student in the market for a kindle-friendly study aid, this book is a safe bet.Please don't misunderstand the somewhat restrained praise I have for this book: I only just got it today and haven't identified any areas where the text is weak or short on detail. They could be out there, but my initial impression is that this is a great product in a very convenient format that definitely deserves 4 stars. I only wish I could speak more firmly on the book's content without misleading anyone."
4,Quality of SHARP,"First off from my experience with SHARP calculator has always been positive.My father has a small pocket calculator that has been working for 30years, before I was even born.With this one it seems they still are constructing them with the same standard.This calculator is perfect for simple use and comes at a reasonable price."
4,Pretty good B.B.,"I hate to give a B.B. King CD any less than five stars, but not every song on this CD is great. I did not like track number 3, The B.B. Jones, at all. It's some cheesy dance tune, from a movie soundtrack. It seems like a song that B.B. was required to perform. His heart is not in it at all. Having said that, the rest of the CD is really good. Several King classics are here like Don't Answer The Door, Paying The Cost To Be The Boss and Sweet Sixteen. There's even a nice instrumental which showcases B.B.'s guitar nicely. Overall, I think there are much better B.B. King collections out there than this one, but it still has some really good stuff (Don't Answer The Door is awesome!) Get Live At The Regal or Live In Cook County Jail before this."
5,THE BEST EASIEST BOOK for learning Gr/Lt,"I was disconcerted by the ""dressing"" of this simple book, but if you do these elementary school exercizes yourself (or if you're a teacher of any age group and adapt these for your use) you will find that this book has easily and systematiclly assembled everything you need to know to learn Greek and Latin roots. It's pricy, but there's a wealth of information in there--VERY useful for parents and teachers."
5,Great book!,My neighbor recommended this book as a tool for summer reading and learning.My daughter loves the book and I like showing her the application it has in words we use every day. She does not mind doing a page or two every day. I find that bit to be an amazing feat. Why they do not teach this in schools is beyond me. Its very practical and what my kids learn they can build on.I would recommend this for everyone in grades 1-12.All-in-all a great book to learn from.
2,Not what I was expecting,"When I ordered this book, I didn't realize that it was a) home made b) for teachers. Considering the price I was expecting a real book, not something that appears to have been assembled at Kinko's with a photocopier. The print is giant, so there is very little information on each page.I was expecting a workbook of some kind for older students, but the format seems to be geared toward very little kids with notes at the bottom with advice for teachers on how to present the material. I found this book disappointing and overpriced."
4,"Plenty of good material, just not as good as 'Two Towers'","The Howard Shore score to the last part of the LOTR trilogy contains plenty of magical moments that bring back instants of the brilliant movie to mind, and definitely accentuate the moments they accompany throughout it. But it felt the same way as the score to ""The Fellowship of the Ring""... there wasn't the same level of flow or coherence in it that I felt in ""The Two Towers"". More simply put, the total didn't feel as great as the sum of the parts or as coherent a piece of work as the score to the second movie. Some of the songs, though (in particular, toward the end, and most of all Annie Lennox's ""Into The West""), were truly brilliant and inspiring. As a result I give it four stars: very good, but not the best it could have been."
1,Love the music. Hate the CD,"--Reviewer guidelines say to focus on the album content. I'd love to. I agree with most every reviewers love of Howard shore's score for the movie. It's wonderful, rich music that expanded the texture of the movie for me. I also was blown away by 'Into The West' and Annie Lennox' performance.Unfortunately I can't focus on the content since the copy I pre-ordered would not play on my CD player and locked up my PC. I have since returned it as defective. What a disappointment."
4,Howard has done it again,"This was an amazing sound track. Billy Boyd what a suprise, he has a great voice. This is not the best Howard has ever done but it was very good never the less. I never liked music like this before but i heard it was good so i bought it, i loved it so much i had to buy the other 2. after listing to it Howard rehashed almost all of my favorite themes, the Rohan theme is lovely but he changed it (but he had to for the new movie). However it was done very artisticly therefore i accepeted it with good grace. this is a must have for all music fans. Once again Howard shows the music world what a great composer he is with this masterpeice. Howard I salute you on a job well done."
5,Great soundtrack and bonus DVD,"I love the music on this soundtrack. It is the perfect mix of brass, strings, percussion, chorus, and solo voice. I think it is the best of the three soundtracks. One part I really love is when Ben Del Maestro sings in track four--it is awesome. To top off this, the bonus DVD rocks! The 25 minute documentary on Howard Shore is quite insightful, funny at times, and very interesting. I also enjoyed the 5-minute ""Super Trailer"" on that DVD--it basically summarizes the whole trilogy in 5 minutes.Overall, I would recommend you went ahead and paid the extra for this copy--not only is it significantly better, but it is a limited edition. If you don't get it now, you may not have another chance.As a huge LOTR fan (I read the books 10X), I think this is a great investment."
5,When Fantasy Meets Reality,"If your a fan of the movie, you'll like this soundtrack.If your a fan of Howard Shore... you'll like this soundtrack.If you like to listen to music AT ALL... you'll like this soundtrack.This is a very haunting, beautiful, sad, yet at the same time, excited and happy, soundtrack. It has something for everyone... from the creepy ""A Storm is Coming,"" to the accomplished ""The Return of the King,"" to the heart-pumping ""The End of All Things,"" to the comforting ""Into the West."" Basically, everything.If you've seen the film, you'll recognize Billy Boyd in ""The Steward of Gondor."" Or, as my friend calls it: ""Pippin's Song.""Overall, a completely wicked soundtrack that I recommend ESPECIALLY to the fans of the film- but anyone can like it."
5,Beautiful....and bittersweet.,The Return of the King soundtrack is probably just as good as Fellowship in my opinion. Haunting melodies and a bittersweet yet beautiful song by Annie Lennox at the end to finish it off make this CD a worthwhile addition to any collection. Howard Shore has outdone himself. Listening to it makes one want to see the movie immediately! : )
2,Purchase below expectations,I like the cd but it came with the case all cracked and broken so the disc slices around inside the case.
3,pippin's song,i haven't gotten the soundtrack but im looking for PIPPIN'S SONG the one he sings to the king..and i can't find it ;_; so if you find it please email me at moonieme@hotmail.com thanks soo much...i love that song sooo much...just saw the movie today....me and my friend both cried. lmls. huggles snuggles and cuddles! thanks
2,Nothing new,All this does is repeat the one theme from the 1st movie. It went well with the movie but just sitting and listening to it by itself it does not hold up well. It is not something I would listen to again.
2,Howard Shore was a poor choice for such a beloved series,"The score functions in its role adequately enough, but the notes lack the spirit of works by more refined composers such as Harry Gregson-Williams or Patrick Doyle. The main LOTR theme sounds good enough, but the rest of the score is sheer boredom.There is a dynamic, emotional quality that is completely missing from Shore's effort, and the score comes accross as something akin to 'elevator music' as a result"
1,EDITING STRIKES AGAIN,"Once again, the adoring public gets screwed. Howard Shore has worked to get the most amazing cinematic soundtrack in history put on disc, and like in TTT, the good tracks have been removed. In TTT, we saw eowyn's theme cut for stupid monotonous boring tracks like the black gate is close and treebeard. wtf? now we see the music from theoden's rousing speech scrapped like garbage for again, weak tracks like end of all things. howard shore i salute you, u have bee screwed, like all of us, but the editing process."
5,If you like classical movie soundtracks...you NEED this!,"My brother and his wife to be walked down the aisle to selections from this soundtrack. With my being a lover of classical music especially that from movie scores...I was instantly hooked. Movie scores have always mystified me even in my own life...made me kind of look back differenly at the world moving around me. I cried at my brother's wedding when his bride to be came out to this music and cried even harder when I sat in the comfort of my office, and then my bedroom while listening to Annie Lennox pour passion and soul into the song ""into the west"". So beautifully written, anyone can find some meaning that touches their life in some personal way...through this beautiful song."
4,Not as good as the other two,"After hearing the soundtracks for the first two movies I was really looking forward to this release. Sadly, I am a little disapointed. Don't get me wrong, it's still good, but the first two were better. It is a definite must-have for any fan of Lord of the Rings. The music has a slower pace to it compared to the first two CD's. Not what you would expect after hearing the music for the Two Towers. Basically, this soundtrack is a rather anti-climatic ending to the best trilogy ever to hit the big screen."
3,Good but not great,"The soundtrack is very good, and there are some really memorable tracks. Minas Tirith/The White Tree is very good, as is the thunderous and ominous Minas Morgul. The Ride of the Rohirrim is good too. I was very disappointed though that the track from the trailer is not on there, and extremely disappointed that the spectacular music from just prior to the Rohirrim's charge was left out. That music combined with that scene was just awesome, and while in the ""Pelennor Fields"" track you can begin to hear them building to it, it gets cut off and never put back. Very disappointing. And the end track could be better too...a pretty song but a bit grating."
4,No theme of its own?,"Though this a beautiful piece, there seems to be many hints of the previous two musical themes from(FOTR + TT) without really striking out on it's own direction. Granted the point of the third installment is to weave the various threads together and provide a final climax. None the less, the subtlety of many of the themes are quite poignant and use a ""less is more"" mentality...wish there had been more and then realize, hey....I'm dead an not even in the third movie. No wonder I don't like it as much!"
5,A Triumph Worthy For A King,Why do you cry Smeagol?Because Howard Shore makes us.He moves us so and we loves him for it.
