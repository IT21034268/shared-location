4,Good Product,"This is a very good product. It tastes good (for a protein shake), and even though it's a lil' more prone to clumping than the Optimum Platinum HydroWhey, it's still an excellent value."
4,Good taste,Some people do not like the taste of this one but I do and think it goes well with the soy milk that I mix it with.
4,Excellent protein supplement,"I have tried other products, but I have to say that this product really shows results. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for that extra protein supplement."
5,It is a tasty protein,"It is easy absorption and flavor, and it last couple of months, easy to digest, Price is very reasonable compare to other proteins"
1,ON-no more!,I used to buy ON's Gold Standard for some time but for $50......will not buy it any more. No subscribe & save option- greed!Sam's club sells 5lbs of Muscletech for $32.
1,ON Opts Out of Subscribe and Save = ZERO,"ON opted out of the subscribe and save program.Now I go to COSTCO and buy Muscle Milk's 6lb bag.I prefer ON, but for $6 less and a pound more of product, MM gets my money.I'll go back to ON if they come back to Subscribe and Save."
3,Urgente,"Good afternoon, I request a review for this product. I paid on December 14. Was released and compensated on my card. I await my product urgently."
1,"Not sure on how good it works, but it tastes HORRIBLE!!!",I took it the first couple of times with water and it tasted VERY bad... So i then tried with milk and at first thought i would be able to drink it.. But after about the 2nd or 3rd time with milk I couldn't even stand the taste it actually made me start to feel sick to my stomach...I now have a practically unused HUGE bottle of protein and I'll never use it again..
1,TERRIBLE,"Container was open, seal had been tampered with and 1/3 of powder dumped out. I bought a NEW package of this whey protein, needless to say I was given a refund. Use caution!"
5,Favorite Protein,"I drink this after my workouts and it tastes great. Mix this up with soy milk or milk, ice, banana and whatever else you like and its good to go. Would recommend 10/10."
3,"Good value, OK taste",I love ON products but I am not a big fan of this flavor. I thought it would taste better especially since I am a Chocolate fanatic.
2,Not as good as the dbl chocolate,"I've been getting the dbl chocolate until this batch of cookies and cream, which I decided to try. The chocolate is great, but I wanted to try something different. The cookies and cream is just too strong and overwhelming. I don't really care for it straight, so I've been trying to dilute it with chocolate syrup. Not really working all that well. My 14yr old son likes it, and I've tried several times now to choke it down in hopes that it'll grow on me, but it's not working. My next batch I try out will be the vanilla."
4,pretty good,"I've never had any other protein powder, but from what it tastes, it's not bad. It will last me forever because it's such a big container. I can't compare to any other brand, but I will def try other flavors. It has the right amount of protein and not many calories. That's a thumbs up from me."
5,ON Whey Protein,This product was great tasting and helped my muscles repair much quicker after a rigorous workout!
5,best whey protein ive ever had,"Let me start by saying that I bought a 5 lb tub of this suff(chocolate) for college without ever trying it. The reviews and ratings seemed good enough for me to try it, and it is amazing. It mixes very well and it tastes great(like chocolate milk, without the protein aftertaste). Another thing that drew me to this product was the low fat levels. I had bought four different brands of protein powder before this, and ALL of them had more fat, and tasted worse. I am extremely pleased with this purchase, and i would recommend this to ANYONE."
5,"No way to quantify results, but it mixes well","I was using some cheaper crap prior to this, and found that this product mixes much more easily. Not sure how nutrition and quality of ingredients compare to cheaper brands, but it tastes fine and you don't have to shake it for 5 minutes just to get it to blend."
3,decent protein,"this protein has a funky nasty taste when mixed in water.In milk, it'd decent tasting. Not sure how effective it is in terms of building muscle, but it is definitely not the worst protein I have had, or is it the best."
2,Could have been better,"I've been using ON products for a little over a year now. For the most part, I've been very pleased. I bought the 10 lb bag back in November because at the time, it was cheaper than the 5 lb tub. Tastes the same but as far as usign it in my shaker cup, this has been very clumpy. Tried some Syntha-6 a month ago and not once did it clump and it tastes much better. Maybe it was a fluke thing with the clumping, but this will be the last ON product I purchase for a long time."
1,Strawberry Flavor Contains Splenda,"Someone else already put down a good review discussing the use of sucralose (Splenda). I'm wishing I had seen that before I placed my order. My body has a bad reaction to artificial sweeteners and had I known it had sucralose in it, I would not have purchased it."
1,Warning: Double Rich Chocolate Should Be Recalled,"I received a 5lb. container of the Double Rich Chocolate on March 28, 2012. About an hour after drinking the first shake, I got sick (won't go into the details). I wasn't sure if it was the powder or one of the other ingredients in the shake, so I tried it again the next day. I got sick again. I paid $52.99 for this giant container, though, and really hoped I hadn't received a bad batch. I tried it two more times and got the same results. I've since stopped drinking it but wanted to post a warning after seeing some other recent reviews of people getting sick.I got such a big size because I'd bought a 1lb. container in February from Amazon and really liked it. No issues with the product that time. I don't know what's in the 5lb. container this time, but it's not good. I won't buy this product again."
4,"A bit hard to dissolve, tastes good","I used the Vanilla flavor the last two times but...Amazon didn't have it in the big tub this time, so I tried this - Chocolate Mint. Tastes good and no after taste. Minor complaint is that it doesn't dissolve as totally as the vanilla did - no matter how much I shake."
3,"horrible taste, good product","While I am happy with this purchase as far as the shipping and quality of the product. The taste is absolutely horrid. Yes, it is that bad. I will be trying a new flavor from the same company next time."
3,What is with the price increase?,"I had this product on Subscribe & Save with 15% discount for $72, now the price has gone up to $79 for S&S, and from $84 to $93 without S&S... Ridiculous price increase on Amazon. Still available on Bodybuilding.com for $84 - 10% off coupon for $74... its sad to see I will no longer be purchasing this from Amazon from now on."
3,Not great.,"Its better than most of the average crud on the market but no where near the premium level it claims to be. I tried to replace the Joe Dillon stuff with this and this stuff just tastes like crap compared to it and has more calories and fat.Its not terrible, but isn't as good as it claims."
2,Tastes terrible,"When I think of cookies and cream, I think of cookies and cream ice cream -- which tastes like Oreos. This tastes like fake cookie dough with too much artificial sweetener. It's awful.Go with the chocolate flavor, it's much better."
4,Great Teast,The Double Rich Chocolate has a great test and it is less sweet than some of the others we have tried. It takes a little bit of effort to get it mixed thoroughly but that is similar to all products of this type. Tastes like a milkshake with low fat milk added.
4,gold standard for a reason,"delicious (i'm very picky about flavor) and easily dissolving with a decent amino acid profile. however, a bit pricey even at the bulk sizes."
5,good protein supplement,great taste (preferred this over EAS chocolate) with 24 grams of protein. very satisfied with this product
3,its so-so,i can drink it but will not buy again. the taste is typically strong and does not give a feel of cookies-n-cream flavor. someone might like it or may not.
4,Great Protein,This is the second protein shake I've tried since I started working out. My first was GNC Pro Performance 100% Whey Protein. ON Gold Standard is a lot better in my opinion because of the taste and it is absorbed faster. I used this for about 2 months and noticed more lean muscle. I recommend double rich chocolate. The next protein I'm trying is Isopure Low Carb.
4,Great,The taste is great. The low sodium content is a huge plus even though I don't currently have high blood pressure. Low on carbs so add a banana after you work out but great if you just want to have straight up protein. The only reason it doesn't receive 5 stars from me is because it has 10% of the cholesterol you need dialy. This is not huge but I wouldn't have more than 1-2 shakes of it a day. If this product had 5% or less I would pretty much have 3 shakes a day. But compared to other protein shakes 10% isn't that much.. WORTH A TRY
3,"Good Whey Protein, but VERY BLAND!","This is a great whey protein product, but it doesn't have much flavor. If you want something that doesn't taste like much, then this is the product for you, but if you want something that can be an enjoyable drink everyday, then definitely get the chocolate flavor. I ordered the chocolate first and really liked it, but then I ordered the vanilla ice cream to try something different, and I don't really care for it. Chocolate was ""whey"" better!!!!"
4,Way good - Whey,"The product mixes well and tastes really good. I'm very satisfied with the purchase and plan to try other flavors (I started with vanilla) For those who are lactose intolerant, it does contain the lactase enzyme, but it could probably use a little bit more. I think the product mixes better than the Designer Whey product."
2,Double chocolate whey,"Was advertised as being double rich chocolate. Taste is bland with light chocolate flavor, nothing Rich about it or double either tastes alright blended with 1/2 banana or with strawberries yummy in that case, probably would not buy if I tasted it first. I had a different product that I mixed in my morning coffee and it was great. This one clumps up if mixed in a warm beverage."
5,Tastes great,It tasts great and it works good. It tasts beter than anything i have ever tried! And it works. I am using it to gain muscle and i have seen big improvements.
4,A very economical good protein,"I tried this during weight loss, I was on minimal diet, working out three times a day. This is a tasty flavor, but as always it is not exactly cake batter so keep that in mind. Blends well, tastes great!"
3,This stuff EXCELS in banana shakes,"I'm reducing my carb intake (doing a half-arsed version of the paleo diet), and I hoped to use this -- in french vanilla flavor -- in my coffee as a sort of quick breakfast routine. It wasn't unpleasant, but I no longer looked forward to cuppa joe.This stuff EXCELS in banana shakes, tho. (Banana, milk, ice, and this....Mmmmm!) Makes it taste all professional and thickens it up too!"
5,good product,Good product and it also has a good taste. I can see the change in first two weeks by taking only on the days I workout.
4,Good quality protein.,"ON Gold Whey is known for high quality protein and was part of the protein absorption testing and was shown to be high quality, but there are lots of high quality protein powders. I think the main factors for picking a protein powder are: does it mix well and does it taste good.ON does mix very well. I mix with 2% milk and I can use a shaker and no clumps are in the bottle. I've even mixed this in a pinch by stacking two cups together ala Cocktail and it came out blended.The taste is decent and better than most I've had. The only thing that put me off initially was the consistency. Using one scoop with 8 oz. milk the mix is still very liquid. I've been used to having a thicker texture with this type of ratio, so it was a bit off putting. But, I've grown used to it and it's actually nice since you can finish off the shake and not have much left clinging to the sides."
3,AYE!,"most of these reviews are about the flavor of this product. if im body building i would be more concerned about the content which clearly says each scoop is only about 72-73% protein. 100 percent? pfft! the bulk WPI i have been using is 91% and tastes like the fruit i flavor it with, Im my case frozen blueberries and fresh bananas. my family tries to get in on the smoothies if im not quick because they are delicious! $150 for 10 kg of WPI, i would never waste money on a gimmick such as this when i can buy bulk direct from the source. Mmmm i hope you enjoy the flavors!my recipe1/2 cup frozen blueberries1 whole banana2-3 scoops of WPI1 handful of walnuts or other raw nuts1 cup of skim milkice cubes and a touch of honey if desiredblend until smooth, enjoy and hide from the family"
5,Great product!,24 grams of protein per serving! Taste good. Does not quite mix as well with a spoon as they claim but is still everything i wanted in a protein powder.
5,LOVE IT LIKE ALWAYS,"EVERYTHING IS JUST 100% PERFECT BUT IT WAS JUST A LITTLE HARD TO FIGURE A WAY OUT TO OPEN THE ""BAG""ANY WAYS THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM LOL AND YEA LOVE THE FLAVOR"
4,protein drinks,"powder mixes well, especially with a shaker. I like it as a smoothie base for lunch or breakfast. Good value for your money. No diet excuses when it's delivered right to your door!Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard, Double Rich Chocolate, 5 Pound"
4,Great product. Tastes pretty good too.,"Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard Cake Batter is a pretty good product. I prefer Optimum Nutrition's Hydro Whey. But I thought I'd give this version a try. I mix my proteins with water and this product dissolves very well, even in cold water. I haven't had any gassy after-effects or bad aftertastes either. As for the flavor, I don't quite think it tastes like a cake batter (maybe it does with milk???). I think it actually tastes like watered-down condensed milk...or kinda like those chewy Japanese Milky candies, if you've ever had one of those. I'd recommend it if asked."
5,Satisfied with the product,"It might be little expensive on Amazon as most things are. However, I am completely satisfied with the product as it was pretty consistent and better than the previous whey product I had bought from GNC or one of the stores."
4,over average,this product arrived in good time at it is the same as the product i ususally bought it arrived sooner than i expected.
5,Muscle builder,It is big enought for one month and two kids (one junior and the other senior). Excellent investment and excellent size.
2,stinks!,Smells bad after a couple if weeks and taste isn't good. The chocolate is way better. I want buy this one again.i think they should discontinue this flavor for sure.
4,Solid,"Dissolves well in water. Seems to be giving me the mass I need (using it to get a total of 1.5 grams protein/per gram of body weight). I got 5 lbs for about $50, great value."
3,Tastes better,I liked the taste better. Not as good as Syntha-6 though. Just used it for month haven't seen any significant results.
3,I Can't Believe it's Not Sugar,This product is too sweet for my liking and it does not disolve as well as the vanilla flavored mixed. This product is best mixed with milk vs. water to tame some of the sweetness.
5,"Awesome Taste, Take hunger away","In bodybuilding you need to keep nutrition in your system constantly. I put three tablespoons into a mini 20oz Blender Bottle and fill with non-fat milk to go with breakfast, lunch, dinner, and sometimes when I just feel hungry. The stuff actually taste great, too!"
3,"Good product, bad shipping","I ordered it during $20 off $99 purchase promotion. It's a nice buy. Good product and thumb up taste. My only problem was Amazon's shipping.I ordered this product twice with 2 packs each. Every time, there was a bag leaking. When I opened the box, it had powder everywhere. It did smell good, fresh strawberry, but I didn't want to know before I opened the bag...Moreover, I discovered the two shipping contained different packages, I'm still not sure whether they are the same products so far...Besides, the two orders have different prices as well. The first one marked as $64.xx and the second one jumped to $79.xx in just 3 days. Luckily, I called Amazon and got refunded.I would say, the whey protein is good, but the shipping was a bad experience. Next time, I probably will go to a local shop and pick a good & right bag myself."
3,Fair,"An adequately priced, run of the mill whey. I prefer Biotest's unflavored whey because it's essentially this product but cheaper and just a bit tastier (a very relative term in this case).This whey has a weird taste thing going on that I can't describe. It is a good whey though if you're not into Biotest, and I had been using it for about a year with no problems."
4,O.N. Gold Standard Whey Protein,"I bought the Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey, Double Rich Chocolate, 5.15-Pound Tub and found the value of this product very good compared to many other retailers. I used this product for about a month (3x daily), using it to supplement my regular diet and workouts throughout the week. I have gained 3-4 Ibs. in that time period. I was expecting better results with this product. Here is my disclaimer however, I weight trained (6x/week) during the entire course of taking this product but did not incorporate any cardio workouts to supplement my weight training. This may have had an impact on weight gained (cardio work is an important aspect of weight training due to the loss of fat that occurs from it). I was hoping to add more healthy weight than just 3-4 Ibs. But please take into consideration your body type, everyone is unique and each person must evaluate his/her make-up when it comes to weight training, cardio work, and weight gain/loss."
3,artificial flavor is so obvious,"Pricing is not bad for this protein powder but the taste is so obviously artificial. If you can't endure bad taste, beware. I trust that the whey protein I'm getting is enough for my daily needs. Aside from the taste, I could not complain anymore."
4,"good quality, good taste","This is no Burger King chocolate shake, but it tastes good, probably better than most proteins out there. It has worked for me so far. There are some cheaper ones out there but not by much. I'd rather pay the extra couple of bucks and stick to this one. It goes down easy on my stomach and I have seen the difference in my body."
4,Good product,"It was a little expensive at the time of purchase and needs to be mixed well in milk to prevent clumps. Otherwise, its a good product."
5,Best whey protein,"Best whey protein in the market in this price segment. Tastes great, easily digestible, I can see the results in just 2 weeks. Don't forget to exercise properly when you take this product."
3,A title for my review,"Well, what can I say. It's a well-priced whey protein powder. It's not going to work any miracles, but it provides some nourishment.It's been my experience that whey protein isn't as good as protein blends, but hey that's just what works for me.Oh, and this sometimes gives me cramps and gas if I drink it on a completely empty stomach."
5,Fantastic Product,"Many other protein products wreak all sorts of havoc on my digestive system, but this product is largely ""invisible"" to me in those terms. However, it is very effective in enabling lean muscle health and increasing mass, assuming you put in the work. I hightly recommend this product."
4,Whey,I am a first time user of Whey and I have nothing to compare it against. I compared contents and price online and Amazon's was comparable. The delivery was less time than scheduled.
5,money well-spent,i wont see the effect till i get really ripped. but i would say french vanilla taste better than chocolate. it's soooooooooo creamy
2,not so great,"I like the taste of this protein. but to be honest, after reading the ingredient list of this product, i am quite reluctant to drink it because there are so much artificial flavor in it and other chemicals. I also experienced gastric discomfort after use. I guess natural/organic ones would be better options."
2,Good for you but taste horrible,"Ive had the vanilla, chocolate mint, and double chocolate. this one taste the worst of the three. Protein is probably good for you but this taste really bad. Ive had the costco brand chocolate protien shake and that taste better than this."
2,Its OK,"I generally get Muscle Milk Chocolate, and thought I'd try something different. Its a much bigger box, lots more servings in the box, but I can't stand the taste..also the drink mix is very liquidy and leaves an almost aweful smell in the shaker sometime even after its washed.I used maybe 1/4th of it to make shakes, and now its just lying in storage and I'm back on muscle milk.Compared to 2-3 scoops in a serving when using muscle milk, this one is 1 scoop a serving. That makes the drink less thick.Just wanted to share what I thought about this product."
3,Blah!,"Chocolate Mint is much better. This stuff does not taste very good, but I'll still finish it off because I payed for the protein not the taste."
4,good for the price,It tastes pretty good for a protein powder. It's as promised and I'm quite satisfied with it. would recommend it.
2,Chocolate Coconut tastes good only for so long,"I enjoy Optimum Nutrition products, but I think I'll need to pass on Chocolate Coconut. I enjoyed this flavor the first 10 or so times I drank it. After a while though, it gets pretty gross and you get over the novelty. Extreme Milk Chocolate is definitely the best whey protein flavor, and it's also the most simple tasting -- which is the best way to go in my opinion! I still have about a 1/2 tub of this stuff, so I'll chug it down for now! Will be opting for Milk Chocolate the next go-around."
3,Nice taste,just shake it in water or milk or any other drink you like and it taste also great.Nice to have in your gym kit
3,Decent flavor,I normally buy chocolate based protein but decided I would try something that would mix better with fruit shakes. This flavor works better but the the chalky taste was still there. It actually tastes better with just water. Mixes well in 8oz and the flavor is OK.
5,Helped me lose weight,I drink a shake with milk for breakfast every morning. I have been losing weight and eat 30% protein in order to lose faster and keep lean body mass. I have lost 51lbs since July and I know it's because I'm eating more protein. This flavor is delicious. Feels like I'm drinking chocolate milk.
4,No Flavor but good Protein,I think this is very good. There is no flavor at all but it doesn't have the sugar and other additives like Muscle Milk and some of the other main brands. I'd buy this again for sure.
5,Optimum nutrition,4th time I bought this product..taste very good and mixes very easily..24gr per serving..The best is the taste..you have to like the taste..some taste like cardboard(not this product)
5,Double chocolate tastes great!,"I am on a restricted calorie diet and recently added power 90 workout videos. I started drinking one of these after my workout and it really lessens my soreness and recovery time. Also I am building a considerable amount of muscle despite my very low calorie intake. At 230 calories per 8 oz glass (if taken with 1%) it had to replace my mini ice cream treat I ate each night, but the double chocolate tastes almost as good! I also have tried vanilla ice cream and I can get it down after a workout if I use an immersion blender, but it doesn't taste very good. The double chocolate tastes very similar to a malted milk shake."
5,Yummy :),The container was in one piece and not leaking when it arrived....That's all that really matters. The product works well and tastes great.
2,The Platinum Whey is a LOT Better,"I started off with the ON Platinum Whey and downgraded to Gold because I figured I wouldn't notice the quality and save some money. I was wrong, because it really does differ by a lot. I know most people get the Gold Standard because the Platinum is a lot more expensive. If you can make a few sacrifices in other expense areas, and instead spend more for the Platinum Whey, it's like night and day in my opinion. The Platinum Whey tastes 10x better, it's thicker, feels like great quality and goes down easy. I've had family members make a Platinum shake just to drink it because they like the taste! The Gold by comparison felt watery (even when I doubled the scoops) and tasted horrible compared to the Platinum."
5,works great and fast,"best whey protein out in the market, gives you fast results, great for recovery and it also digests pretty good"
4,Cookies and Cream,"My review is based solely on the taste of the ON Cookies and Cream Whey.Mixing: I use a big glass and a large spoon and stir. No clumps!With milk - It tastes great, like a vanilla milk shake. I find myself looking forward to my pre/post workout shake.With water - It tastes bad! I find myself using a chug technique just to get it down. I dread my protein shakes when I am cutting calories and remove milk from my diet."
3,Bitter Mint,"The quality of this product, like ON Whey, is really good.. I just can't say that the flavor of this Chocolate Mint as good at all.. The chocolate is overpowering of the mint at most times but when you do taste the mint, it's kind of bitter. Smells better than it tastes, really. I'll probably be going back to cake batter or vanilla."
4,Awesome product but..,Check your local GNC - they usually have great prices on this stuff! The product itself is very efficient - I use it after weight-training workouts.
3,I love the product but the price goes up faster than gold.,I have bought this product for several years and really like it. The only problem that I have is that the price goes up faster than gold prices and gasoline. It's just Whey for crying out loud.
5,Very good,"Tropical Punch is a great flavor, a must needed change from the usual chocolate and vanilla. Mixes very well and tastes very good as well."
4,Very good flavor (for a protein shake),"This actually is a very good product. I'm just a simple guy who goes to the gym 3 times a week to be healthy and of course to try to build a good looking body (without steroids and stuff like that) so honestly i can not say this really help you build body mass fast. But is has decent ""good"" taste and medically speeking, you do need protein if you are lifting weight, just don't spect magic."
3,EAS tastes better,"I've been using EAS 100% Whey Protein 5 LBS Chocolate - Value Packs - Resealable Packaging for quite some time and was very happy with it -- I love the chocolate taste (even with water) and it mixes well. After reading the reviews here on Amazon though, I thought I'd give ""Gold Standard from Optimum Nutrition"" a try... however it tastes like a cheap artificial hot chocolate mix. I must recommend EAS first, but this brand is doable and mixes well, however my next order will be a bag from EAS!"
5,Can't complain.,"There really isn't anything bad to say about the quality of ON protein. They are ranked one of the best for a reason. As for the 10lber, I must admit, Double Rich Chocolate does get boring after a while. But then again, I'm not into chocolate all that much. It was the only one I could get a good deal on. But if you like chocolate, this is good.As for Amazon, I must commend them for their super fast ridiculous shipping. I ordered this on 9/14 late afternoon PST and it arrived early in the morning on 9/16. This is with the free super saver shipping. I was expecting it to come the very next week but it came so fast! Keep it up Amazon!"
4,Great Value.. Pretty Good Tast,"For the money this is the best protein out their. Taste wise it is above average for its low calorie standard. Do not expect a rich Muscle Milk type protein because this is not that. There is a reason MM is 200 calories more per serving. This does the job though, and has a decent taste."
4,Good taste and excellent energy,"I've only tried the Vanilla, will be getting chocolate next time. Mixes up easy, tastes just fine mixing with water. Take 30 minutes after working out and keeps the boiler running till lunch."
5,Tastes Great,I've had other flavors from Optimum Nutrition but this one by far tastes the best. I still want to try the Mocha one. Also does exactly what it is supposed to do. I use right before and right after a workout. Helps to keep me going.
5,"Yes, Whey","The Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey, Double Rich Chocolate is the best tasting and performing protein shake I have ever used."
3,Misleading Description,"I was looking for the older packaged version - as was advertised here. More specifically, I was looking for the version that had lower cholesterol per serving. It was advertised that the version shown here (in the description) had 10mg per serving. But they sent me the newer version (which has 30mg per serving). If I wanted the newer version, I would just have walked into the nearby GNC store to get it. I searched everywhere online, thought that I finally found what I was looking for, here on Amazon - only to be mislead.Other than the cholesterol content per serving, I am a big fan of this product (not the yucky Strawberry flavor though, but the vanilla versions)."
5,"great taste, great results","I have been overweight (150 lbs. overweight) most time of my life, and as a 24 yrs young woman, was hard to develop long lean muscles, but this product (plus my diet and exercises), is really helping me to make it through my goal.It doesn't taste like Nesquick, but is really great for smoothies, I prepare it with water to minimize the calorie intake, and it taste good."
5,It tastes great!,"I actually served up a serving of the banana cream with a real banana and half a mango, and some crushed ice. It tasted great! The only thing that could have been better was adding in some ice cream... I like the results of the ON Whey because of the Aminos they add in their recipe. I feel recovered faster of good workouts and getting great results."
4,I like it,"I prefer the natural gold std whey, but I was bored with the lack of flavors so I bought this. It's actually really tasty with milk (I use vanilla soy milk). Its not that bad with water either. I think buying the 5lbs was an over kill. I will probably try something different if I can actaully get thru all this. I still use the gold std whey natural vanilla as my go to post work out drink."
3,ON whey is great just dont get the cookies n cream flavor.,Optimum Nutrition makes a great Whet product. I started with the chocolate. Excellent flavor and mixes very well in blender bottle with milk. No bubbles. I then tried cookies n cream flavor and I can honestly say I hold my nose when drinking it. I'm horrified I still have 4lbs of it to go through as I won't waste it. Not only does it taste rancid it doesn't mix well in blender bottle with milk. Leaves a large layer of bubbles. So just get the chocolate.
5,Awesome Product,I have been using this for close to a year now. No other brand can beat this product. Period. Absolutely awesome whey. Mixes instantly. Complete pack of amino.
2,Needs to be mixed with milk and vanilla ice cream,"I bought this whey because it was a bit cheaper than the other ones. Never had it before now.I have mixed this flavor with water a few times and it tastes pretty nasty. (I have always mixed all my whey with water in the past)Though it's a pain, if you mix a little vanilla ice cream, then put a splash of milk, then the whey and blend/mix it up, it tastes pretty decent.I'm assuming its as effective in promoting rebuild of muscle fibers as any of the other gold standard whey flavors.Wouldn't buy it again because of the taste though."
2,Not Cookies and Cream,"5 stars for quality, but 0 stars for flavor. I decided try this flavor instead of my normal Chocolate Malt. This tastes nothing like Cookies and Cream... tastes just like coffee. The drink also gets very foamy when mixed in my BlenderBottle with water. I like Optimum Nutrition protein, just not this flavor. I'm going back to Malt after I get through these 27 servings."
2,Open Container,"The plastic seal was unopened but had powder all over the container when I took it out of the box. When I opened the lid the paper cover was already open. I do not know if it was already open or if it some how opened during the process of the delivery. It makes no sense why they would ship an open container. The time of shippment was good but the powder was all over the container and the second seal was open. The delivery was messy and the open cover seems suspicious, not sure if I should try it. Don't know how much powder was suppose to be in the container because the powder was all over the container therefore, I do not know how full it was initially. In general the delivery and presentation of the product was a dissapointment."
2,Stay away from strawberry,"I've been drinking 2 shakes/day of Optimum Nutrition for about a year now. Here's how I'd rate the flavors on a 10 point scale:Vanilla Ice Cream: 9Extreme Chocolate: 8Cookies and Cream: 8Delicious Strawberry: 3Something just isn't right with the Strawberry flavor. It tastes....almost chalky, like a TUMS. I tried adding sugar, creamer, strawberry syrup, couldn't get a good taste out of it."
1,not so delicious strawberry,"Avoid delicious strawberry.. It has to be one of worst tasting proteins I've had.. The chocolates (extreme milk and double rich), creamy french vanilla, cookies and cream taste pretty good... Going to try rocky road next..Update: Rocky road is great.. 5 stars for gold standard all together.. But now ON has decided to no longer participate in the subscribe and save plan.. Sure going to miss that.. Delivered just in time for the previous one to run out.."
3,They changed the ingredients....,"As many people have said, the OLD label double rich chocolate is fantastic; it tastes just like chocolate milk. However, the double rich chocolate in the NEW label (as pictured above) has a very weird artificial after-taste.... What the heck happened?"
2,Extreme Milk Chocolate = Sucralose City,"I was pretty happy with the Double Rich Chocolate flavor, so I decided to branch out slightly into Extreme Milk Chocolate, unaware that Ashton Kutcher was waiting in the next room to run out and yell ""Sucralose'd!!!"" The sweetener is overwhelming and gross, (Double Rich Chocolate doesn't have it). The website has no indication which flavors have sucralose and which use other sweeteners, so I'm afraid to try any other new variations. If anyone can report other non-sucralose flavors, I'd greatly appreciate it."
5,Works beautifully.,I received the chocolate on time and I have to say that it works beautifully. My recovery of muscles were good to the point to where I felt no soreness the next day and allowed my muscles to get stronger. This did the job that it promised to do for not a bad price either. Good product.
3,Not as good as Muscle Milk light,"I bought the Double rich chocolate as a meal replacement to aid weight/fat loss and promote muscle growth.Pros:-Cheaper than Muscle Milk-Has fewer carbs and costs less than Muscle Milk and Muscle Milk lightCons:-Tastes awful with water-Tastes alright with milk, but that adds about 10 carbs-Works with non-sweet Almond milk (still nothing to look forward to)-Did I mention it tastes bad-Really badSuggestions:If you're looking into a good cheap protein shake and don't care about taste try this. If taste is your thing go with Muscle Milk or MM light. Also the scooper that some reviewers can't find was located at the very bottom of my container. I had given up on it until about 1/4 of the jar was left and I saw the handle poking out. Not a bad product with Almond Milk. Mixes about the same as every other product I've tried"
5,Better than the Twin Labs,"I recently switched from the ON over to the Twin Labs. I consider it a mistake. The ON is definitely the better tasting product, and it mixes much better. I would recommend it over the Twin Labs to anyone.I have only tried the chocolate in both brands though."
2,Rocky Road taste,I've been a customer of Optimum Nutrition for quite some time now and I have always been trying new flavors. I have to say that I've tried at least 7 different flavors now and this one has been the WORST. It tastes absolutely horrible. The only good thing about it was the fact that it was optimum nutrition so I knew it was good protein and it mixed really well...Or was it? When I received my package the plastic wrap was sealed but when I opened the jar the stay fresh seal was slightly open.EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE TASTE. Had to force myself to drink this one when I was MORE that happy to drink all the others.
4,Good bang for buck.,"Great price for a tub of this size. Warning, tastes horrible in water, but tastes JUST like regular chocolate milk when mixed with milk. It says to only mix one scoop, but that's only 25g of protein. Mix two scoops every time you drink it. You can mix the two massive scoops in as little as 8 ounces of milk and it will taste just fine without any undisolved chunks."
4,Only thing better is ON Double Rich Chocolate,"There are three important things to me when it comes to which whey protein to buy: Nutritional Value, Taste, and Cost. And in all three of those areas Optimum Nutrition has hit a home run. They managed to pack 24g of Protein into only 120 Calories with only 3g of Carbohydrates and 1g of Sugar. And at less than $45 on Amazon for 74 servings I couldn't ask for much more. Oh, and by the way, it tastes great. I happen to prefer the double rich chocolate flavor myself, but either way you go, you won't be unhappy."
5,"Quality, great-tasting protein","I've tried plenty of protein shake powders in the last 15 years and this is the first that I've found that truly tastes good. While I can't necessarily attribute my recent weight/muscle gain to this product (since I've recently started lifting regularly after an inconsistent period), I have definitely seen improvement. Recently finished my first 5 lb. container (Double Rich Chocolate) and on to my next (Extreme Milk Chocolate). Both taste good, but the Double is the better of the two."
2,Taste not as good as Platinum Whey,"This stuff tastes really really bad, especially of you tasted the Platinum Whey before. I found it hard to consume, simply from a taste perspective.-r"
1,Scam.....,"The protein that I received did not have a protective seal on it, that is required by law. I am assuming that it was taken off so that I would not be able to return it. Not using my best judgement I tried the protein anyways. I tried a scoop of the protein after my workout. It make me sick to my stomach and light headed like I was gonna vomit. This lasted about 2 hours. This didn't make since because I was having a great day and a great workout. I have tried this ON protein in the past with no complaints. I think the protein was either contaminated with something or spoiled. I think the sender is trying to get rid of this bad product and knows if they send it without the protective seal then whoever receives it can not return it, per the amazon return policy."
1,NOT the best tasting,"I've tried all 17 Optimum flavors and they are NOT the best tasting. I like protein shakes that taste like a dessert with absolutely zero ""protein shake"" taste. The only flavor I could enjoy a little was ""Mocha Cappuccino"", because the bitter coffee after taste masked the ""protein shake"" taste.If you're picky and not liking Optimum either, I suggest trying Wellements Pro-Rate Vanilla Cream. It is the only protein shake I can truly enjoy. Don't get the Wellements chocolate flavor, I only had one scoop of the entire 6lbs bag and had to give it away to my ex-...Yuck.My tongue works very well and yes, I am very picky."
1,Please beware!,"First off, the product itself is amazing, the quality and the taste, I know it, it's not the first time I purchase it. But if only ON knew what Amazon does to their reputation!The item arrived perfectly sealed. Outside. It was much later when I found out that the inside protection was damaged, and the weight was also all wrong. The 5-pound bottle weighed 1 lb less!Beware!"
1,warning,"I have used this product on a consistent basis for years. However, the primary problem is that it can be shipped in an almost spoiled condition. By that I mean it either becomes somewhat malodorous very soon or it can cause stomach cramps. Neither is good. While the product might be very good at a good price when fresh the whole idea does not work when it makes you sick. I am switching to Muscle Milk"
1,Yuck; Fermented Sock Fiber Flakes.,"I ordered the Cake Batter flavor. I figured it was time to try something new after having used both GROW Whey, and BSN Syntha-6 (both of which are awesome).I should not have dared it this time though.This stuff tastes like S#@%. It mixes fairly well in both milk and water... but the mixing is not the problem. It's the gagging and choking which ensue after you start drinking it.Trust me on this and buy BSN Syntha-6 instead of this crap."
5,Just In Case You Still Have Doubts...,... here is yet one more review for this product. It's actually less of a review and more of an endorsement. This item has already been reviewed to death by people more knowledgeable than me. I think it tastes great and it mixes well. That's all I was looking for in a protein supplement.
2,Wrong flavor,"I have gotten the strawberry banana flavor before, and it was awesome. The price is good too. However, they sent me chocolate mint instead. I would of sent it back, but I was lazy and curious about the flavor. It's not terrible, but I wish I had gotten what I ordered. Strawberry banana is much better."
5,great product,i've been using this product for 4 years now and im very satisfied with it. i would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a protein powder that is low in sugar and has a higher protein concentration per scoop than most other products
1,"this Whey Protein is good, but buy it elsewhere","I ordered the 100% whey protein in free shipping (5-9 days), hoping to get it within 10 days.But it took more than ()@#*$@ two weeks to arrive.I would definitely buy this kind of stuff at local store from now on."
2,Artificial FLAVOR.!!!!,"It seems healthy untill you read on the ingredients list... ARTIFICIAL FLAVOR.... What the hell.!!!! Artificial stuff is the cause of most Illnesses and diseases.... Healthy Foods dont come ARTIFICIALLY.!!!! Try hemp protein that contains RAW ORGANIC HEMP. Protein, Amino acids, Zinc, Magnesium.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GO HEMP GO HEMP... NOT ARTIFICIAL STUFF... ATRIFICIAL KILLS."
1,A lot of addresses out of date....,"Around 50% of items I sent out cam back undeliverable... although this is not necessarily the authors fault, due diligence should have been applied in checking addresses.The catagories are very poor. The whole book needs to be rehashed...Don't waste your money...."
4,"Irreverent, humorous, and educational","""The Dumb Architect's Guide to Glazing Selection"" is a 50-page basic overview of how to understand the window rating system. It is narrated by four zany cartoon characters. Lots of white space, bright cartoons, funny one-liners, and good window illustrations makes learning about windows specs enjoyable. Have fun while you learn about U-values, solar heat gain coefficient, visible light transmittance, air leakage, low-e, convection, etc.Irreverently written, yet very informative this is actually a useful book that any subcontractor could read on a 20-minute break and be entertained while being educated. Anyone who plans on buying a window should read this book first.The author, Jason McLennan, is a well-respected green architect active with the USGBC. He is quite brilliant and was especially creative to use the ""Calvin and Hobbs"" style format to teach what is normally a slightly dry subject."
4,Enjoyable read,This type of book is what I read for relaxation and this author (Krentz/Quick) is one of my favorites.
3,Not so good..,I actually was pretty disappointed. This was the first time I've read Amanda Quick and I probably won't pick up another one. The stories were so predictable and while both were promising at the beginning they just became somewhat of a joke.The hero from Surrender was especially disappointing. I just don't understand how anyone could have found him appealing after they were married.
5,the great GOOGLES.,"I THINK THIS TOY IS VERY CUTE IT IS MY TENTH WEBKINZ. AND I ALSO HAVE THE PINK GOOGLES TOO, AND IT HAS SOFT SKIN ON THE BACK , AND THE WHITE ONE HAS SPIKY SKIN ON THE BACK.MY PINK ONES NAME IS patti.MY WHITE ONES NAME IS GIGGLES. IM PLANNING ON GETING THE BLUE GOOGLES AND NAMING IT destiny THAT IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY."
5,I LOVE IT!!!!,"This googles is great!!!! At first I thought it would be like a platypus, but after I saw it I found out that it was much much better! It has velvet flippers and is very cuddly.Even if you are not much for stuffed animals, it is worth it just To go to *Webkinz World*. I very much recommond this toy!!"
5,webkinz googles review,I bought the Googles Webkinz for my daughter and she LOVES it. I was impressed with its condition when we got it--sometimes getting plush animals through the mail doesn't go so well. The Webkinz Googles duck is really cute and cuddly. I have NO regrets at all about this purchase.
5,Most loved toy,"My grandson loves this animal, it goes with him everywhere, the web site is wonderful and educational. So much fun. I wish they had things like this when I was a kid."
5,BUY THE GOOGLES!!,"I have a googles and I love it! I also have a baby one. My friends all love my googles. My googles has been on my bike and is still in good shape. It's snount has faded a bit. I really like to play with my googles online too. I have 14 webkinz and this one is still my favorite so, buy the googles!"
1,Useless in Latin America,"You will not be understood if you use this course to learn for Latin America. It is not only the different vocabulary. The differences go much deeper.To start with, some letters are pronounced differently. This is mainly the case with s, z, x, ll. Then some expressions are quite different. For example for hello and good bye, you don't say 'que tal?' or 'hasta luego'. You say 'que hubo?' and 'chao'. When it comes to directions, people don't say 'recto' but 'derecho' and you must not use 'coger' which has a bad meaning.And there is more to come, like different language structures. You don't use 'vosotros', the past tense is different, etc, etc.All in all, you will be helpless if you rely on this course to learn for Latin America. Better buy a better one!"
2,Disappointment.,"It is very difficult to tell which bears are which (size-wise) with this game. Add to that no way to keep track of which bears have been called. Not what you would expect from Learning Resources.It got some stars because my 2 year old liked the bears and enjoyed putting them on the correct color on all 4 of the boards. Otherwise, this would have not have received any stars from me."
4,HP 3550 DeskJet Printer,"My former printer was HP's 820C DeskJet, now discontinued. So I wasn't prepared for the noise made by the 3550 or the fact that it's a lot slower. But I was very pleased with how easily it was set up! Print quality is superb for a machine this inexpensive and I've experienced no paper jams. I would have liked a longer power cord and a different location for the transformer but, over-all, it's great value for someone like me looking for reliability in a low cost printer having as few features as possible."
1,HP only replace a BLEND NEW printer with REFURBLISHED UNIT,"After installing and setup my blend new HP Deshjet 3550 printer according to instruction, I tried to print some docummnet. The printer jammed right away and the on/off light was blinking constantly.After clearing the paper jam and tried to print, it jammedagain. IT DID NOT EVEN PRINT A SINGLE WORD - BUT KEPT JAMMING.I called HP and the technical person tried different way to corrected the problem for 1 hr. Then she said she will replace the BLEND NEW PRINTER WITH A REFURBLISHED ONE. I ARGUED WITH HERTHAT I SHOULD GET A BLEND NEW ONE SHE TOLD ME THIS IS HP POLICY.Then I talked with her manager, HE TOLD ME THE SAME THING. ""ITIS HP'S POLICY IF YOU BUY A NEW UNIT AND HAPPEN TO BE A DEFECTEDONE, THEY ONLY REPLACE IT WITH A REFURBLISHED UNIT. I ASKEDHIM THAT IF HE BOUGHT A BLEND NEW CAR IT WOULD RUN AND WOULD HETAKE A USED CAR!!!!!!"
1,Pass on this one,"Don't bother - very disappointing for an HP product. This printer fails to print consistently and ""carriage stalls"" frequently. This defect is clearly well known at HP Support. The manual solution, while effective, is not a real answer. Save your time and money on this one.(...)"
1,Not Good,I have always been a big fan of HP printers. I have an HP 920c at work and love it. I was trying to find one for my home but they have discontinued it. Instead I bought this one and have been so disappointed with it. It jams all the time and the color isn't as good as the 920c. It makes a terrible noise when it is trying to pull the paper through and it always manages to pull at least 5 pages at a time. Now it is refusing to print anything. I am not happy with this printer at all.
1,Worst Printer Ever!,"I have had many printers in my time, but i have to say this is the worst printer i have ever seen!I actually paid for it aswell!, i could of got a free printer with my computer, but instead i upgraded and got this!Like many people have said, its:- always jamming! Every time!- It wont print in black?- Extremely hard to get the paper in- Screw's up all my print out's [that actually print]- Wont turn off! The green light just keeps on flashingI dont understand why HP could sell such a rubbish printer? Shame on them!"
1,Avoid this printer,"This printer is not worth your time and frustration. I received it essentially free--for the nominal price of one Slovenian tolar, or about half a US cent--when I bought a new HP computer. Even at that price, it was not a good value. It jams nearly every time it tries to feed paper, and on the rare occasions it manages to print with no malfunction, the quality is poor. If zero stars were an option, I'd give it zero. I quickly replaced it with a 'real' printer. Look elsewhere."
4,a nice enough little printer,"I bought this printer during my freshman year of college, wanting a reasonably cheap printer to avoid having to constantly trek to the library to print papers. While my friends who have bought similar HP models have had problems with them, I've found this printer to be reliable and suitable for my needs. It prints extremely quickly for an inkjet - although it does tend to be rather noisy - and I particularly like the feature which allows me to print on both sides of a page easily. It is also compact, which is always good in a dorm room. While it would not be suitable for someone printing extremely high volumes, I would recommend this printer for students."
1,Never Came,"The product looks like a bargain, but it never arrived. I ordered it on June 6 (its now July 25) for $7.48 (much cheaper than it's current price) and was stoked. I hate giving bad reviews, but I think I'm justifiably disappointed."
4,Good product,I have this on top of our counter and use it all the time. It works well and most of the spices that came with it are common users.
1,Not what I expected,"First, the product description says the unit measures 11.8 X 7.5Then further in the product review, it states the rack measures 10 1/2 by 5 3/4. Well, the unit actually measures 11"" high by 6"" wide. Then, it states TWICE in the description that the rack comes with 16 GLASS containers filled with spices. The containers are a cheap PLASTIC.Based on the product review, I purchased 2 Racks to give as gifts, but after the mis-measurement and flimsy Plastic containers ( that will eventually hold odors), I promptly returned them. Amazon.com should really correct this innacurate & misleading product listing."
3,Average run of the mill spice rack,"I like the design of this spice rack. It doesn't take up much space in the kitchen and is easily accessible due to its' rotating base. Some of the spices are things I've never heard of despite years of cooking items of different tastes. One of the lids wouldn't screw in right, and some of the jars won't fit into some of the holes. It's a quality beech wood item though, and the spices are all fresh and quality."
3,Broken Caps,The main problem was that over half of the jars had broken caps. Some were actuallt in tiny pieces.
1,FREE SPICES -- NOT!,"I've been trying for the past 2 months to get the ""free refills"" promised to be obtainable for 5 years after purchase of the rack. The site is having server problems which prevents the refill order from being placed and customer service will not respond to my requests to fix it. The free refill perk is the main reason I purchased their spice rack, since I do a lot of cooking."
2,Spice rack and jars are poor quality,"This spice rack does not compare to others I have purchased. The spice jars are poor quality plastic, rather than glass. The rack does not rotate smoothly, and the jars are not supported well while in the rack. In addition, my spice rack contained 2 jars containing the same spice. Do not purchase this item unless you expect to throw it out after the spices are used up."
4,Nice Rack,"Come on someonbe had to title it that way. We haven't used it too much but I lke that it doesn't take up too much space. I'm confused on the plastic lids they don't seem to be easy on easy off. I do like the refills of the pices though. We got one to put our current stuff in and then we found it was filled and didn't fit in there, but that was my fault. I like the look and the size of it and my girlfriend and I will be trying to cook new things with the spices in the rack soon."
2,Too small and comes with non organic spices,"I like the design, it's user friendly, space efficient, aesthetically pleasing, etc. But it comes WITH spices that I would not have chosen, plus who knows how they were produced? That part wasn't clear to me. For people who buy their own spices, be aware that many will not fit in the spaces. Too bad, because I love the way this one looks! If you are not attached to buying your own spices, and are happy to use the ones that come with the rack, then it's an excellent deal so go ahead."
3,Got what I paid for,Jars are plastic. The slots do not fit any other spice jars we have. The spin is nice. 16 jars in one small tower is great. The price was very affordable. Nice variety of spices that come in the jars. It was not exactly what I was looking for but I am still finding good use for it.
3,Nice but it come with spices which is not told,I bought this after looking at a lot of other choices on amazon and I bought it because it doesn't say that it contained spiced. The other products stated that it included spices which is what I don't want. I wanted to buy it to put my existing spices in and clear my work area.So it was disappointing to get this full of spices. Now it's just sitting waiting to be used and emptied. How can I throw them away? It would such a waste especially since it must have been included in the price.The bottle itself are nice and light. The cover for the spices (the one with holes to let through the spices) are very flimsy and hard to get off. I had to use a knife to push it out with a lot of strength.The light wood holder is good though.
2,Don't buy it for the spices and don't buy it for the storage,"The spices, needless to say, aren't top notch, or even mediocre notch. The construction of this four-sided spice rack is so tight and unsecured that the containers are just dying to spill out. If you spin it too fast be ready to play 16 spice pick up."
4,Functional,We have had this spice rack for several years. It has held up well and we have used most of the spices. I have yet to figure out what a couple of them are for though... It is a nice sturdy wood and it fits nicely back under the upper cabinets (it isn't too tall). It would look/work great in almost any kitchen.
1,Poor Quality,"We ordered this as gift for my daughter-in law. When we received it I noticed that one corner of the box was banged up a little, so I opened the box to see if it was damaged. Thank God I did, when I pulled it out of the box, it fell apart. There was nothing holding the thing together, the top came off and bottom fell of. There apparently was no glue on it at all. It would have been a total shame if we had given it to her and then this happened. It is going back."
3,freshness of spices,"THERE IS NO RECOGNIZABLE DATING ON THE SPICE BOXES. HOW DO YOU DETERMINE THE FRESHNESS OF THE SPICES IN THE RACK YOU'VE JUST PURCHASED? WHAT IS THE NORMAL SHELF LIFE OF THE VARIOUS SPICES OFFERED?HOW DO YOU OBTAIN FRESH SPICES, YOUR TELEPHONE ORDERING NUMBER IS DISCONNECTED AS OF 5/20/02?"
4,Great Buy!,I was weary of purchasing this particular spice rack due to the reviews I read yet went through with it anyway. Other people said their spices came in plastic jars but mine came in glass. I repeat: GLASS. Very good quality. It's very compact and thus appropriate for many kitchens with little space to spare. I bought this as a gift and it went over very well.
3,Product description is wrong,The product descriotion says they are glass jars what actually arrives are cheap plastic ones. Overall a great value and the pizza seasoning is flame!
1,Broken caps,"I absolutely loved this product until I started to unpack it today and found broken caps. We exchanged it for another one at another store, since it was closer to my husband's job, thinking what was the likehood of it happening twice at two different stores. Sure enough, I open it and find more broken caps. I haven't even gotten to use it yet and it's been nothing but a hassle."
5,compelling,"I read this many years ago when it first came out in paper back and have re_read it several times since then. This is a book that examines hate, love, loyalty, friendship and how they change, develop and can erode overtime. The central characters are strong and draw the reader in. It is not a typical romance. So if you are looking for a light read without detailed descriptions of places, events and sometimes everyday life this book is not for you. I love it and will no doubt read it again."
1,Not what I expected,"I have enjoyed other books by this author (early England)and I love her mysteries in very early England. But, this book was to way far out there for me to get into or enjoy."
1,Not fit for print,"I bought this book for my fiance as a Christmas present based upon the previously positive reviews. I was thoroughly embarassed by its blatantly sexist content and just plain lack of helpful information.According to the author, all women lose their minds when they become brides and grooms are expected to respond by tolerating it. That's the entire scope of the book. Don't bother reading it if you're expecting something more helpful or enlightening.For God's sake, don't spend money on this book. You can find a *FREE* gently-used copy of it in my trash."
1,Is it authentic?,"When I read the customer reviews of this book, I was thinking of buying it -- because it contained so much ""new"" material. However, I looked up the customer reviews of other books by this author, and now have serious doubts about his ""journalistic"" ethics. Maybe he made the whole thing up. In any case, after reading about his other books, I'm not interested in this one."
2,"Put the money towards a National Parks pass, and go see the real thing.","Bought this at Costco before going to tour some of the parks. It plays like a cross between EWTN and that euthanasia video from ""Soylent Green""."
4,Expands true knowledge...,"The naturalist, materialist, and empiricist will cringe at Polanyi's book. True knowledge for Polanyi is derived as the mind becomes an active contributor to knowledge and appropriates knowledge through reason. In this regard he is similar to Kant.Dogmatic and exclusive science is thereby dethroned and caste not lower than other forms of knowledge, but along side them. Knowledge based on authority and experience is shown to be interpersonal and relational. As a result, knowledge truly is personal and is not abstract. Therefore, knowledge derived via philosophy, religion, or authority can be just as valid as that which is derived from the chemistry set. This is a difficult task, but Polanyi works hard and ends with a compelling accomplishment."
4,No More Chuffing,I havent had these for very long but from what i have heard so far I really don't care what other people say about these cables but I replaced my old generic subwoofer cable and had buyers guilt for spending so much on just one cable but THIS CABLE IMPROVED MY SUBWOOFER PERFORMANCE 150%. Im not trying to sell monster here but I fully back that you need high quality cables to get what you paid for out of your equipment (at least your sub) and you cant go wrong with THX.
5,A History of the Sea,"I am a fan of pirates, nautical, and maritime history so this set was the perfect choice for me. I saw that the seller only had 20 of the 22 books, but I was fortunate enough to get the last 2 elsewhere. The books have great illustrations and go into great detail on each subject. They came used so I had to deal with peeling off a sticker or two, but I didn't mind. These books are printed in the 90's, but they still offer a great level of accuracy and detail into ships, subs, and oceanic travel. If you know someone who loves the sea and wants to learn more about the vessels of old, find them this collection."
3,In this bio the pictures strangely tell the life story almost the best--just a bit less than the main text!,"There is, say, everything from a photo of attractive Whitney from the 60's when she was on guest starring Batman (playing opposite also-guest Victor Buono, a man she describes as one of the sweetest men she ever met) to her early 80's shot when she was imitating Bo Derek with a braided hair style. But the main text is fine too. This bio (with more depth) confirms facts we TOS Trekkies already knew about her, like how her life style just sank to the bottom and of the ocean and then much deeper when she was suddenly dropped from the original ST series. We learn that James Doohan (Scotty) was the man she was mutually closest to on ST:TOS and other new facts as well."
3,Great Old Comedians Talk About Old Comedy,"Some classic interviews from the 60's. Comedy has changed a LOT since then. (Looks as if the Jerry Seinfeld interview was added later)Not much to learn here for young aspiring comedians IMO. But if you're into the oldies, a few born in the 1800's...then go for it."
3,I've come to believe that there is no suction bowl that a baby can't move,"That said, this one doesn't totally suck. The bowl is wide and low, which can help a baby learning to use a spoon. The suction actually works better if the high chair tray is kind of dirty (I learned by accident.) But really, it doesn't stay stuck, none of them do. Just put the food on the tray and wait until they're old enough not to find dumping a bowl of mac and cheese on their head hilarious."
3,"Good dish, but doesn't suction well","The bowl shape is great, I just wish it would suction well to my son's plastic high chair tray."
5,Love these books,These books provide a great little overview of a history period. Great for the age they are intended for. My daughter is memorizing these poems and loving it.
5,Loved this set!,I bought and had this set for a couple of years. They were great! When I moved passed them on to My Daughter and then they were passed on to my Ex Husband/her Dad. Wish I had them back! Much better than the set I have now...Please Bring Them Back if You Can. Would Love To Order Again. Thank you!
2,Ancient History Poorly Presented,"I made a valiant effort with this book and made it about half way through. I very rarely quit reading books, but this one wore me out. On the plus side, I did experience what life was like for early explorers. Distances were described in days of travel rather than miles. Hardships ""on the road"" were extreme. But the heart of the book, the descriptions of the places visited and the people of these places, left me truly wondering about the veracity of the experiences. Lush gardens with mellons piled high in the middle of a desert seemed highly improbable. But even more annoying was the feeling of being lost in an unknown world. Although Polo did not have any maps when he traveled, having maps would have helped the modern armchair traveller to know where Polo was so the reader could more easily determoine where in the world was Marco Polo. It all seemed too fanciful and disconnected for this reader."
5,awesome,I bought this book as a requirement for a class. I got it for the kindle app on my ipad. It was only $1 and it was downloaded instantly so there is no way you can beat that. Very pleased!
1,Kindle Nightmare,"NO ACTIVE TABLE OF CONTENTS = NO NAVIGATION = READER'S NIGHTMARE.The first 6% of the book consists of three Prefaces in which the scholars who worked on the volume praise each other. We're even ""treated"" to a lengthy disquisition on one scholar's service in Bitish India. Pages and pages of one Prefaces are in French and Latin (perhaps Italian.)THE ONLY WAY OUT OF THIS SCHOLARS' MUTUAL ADMIRATION SOCIETY IS VIA DOZENS (SEEMS LIKE HUNDREDS) OF CLICKS OF THE NEXT-PAGE BUTTON.Avoid this Kindle book!!!!!"
2,Kindle Edition,This book is not good on the Kindle. First it took about 10 minutes of hitting Next Page in order to get through all the introductions. Second this edition has 2 pages of footnotes for every page of the actual book. The text and notes are the same font so it is hard to distinguish between them. Maybe it is of interest to an academic but to a casual reader it is a bit annoying. It was only 99 cents so I guess it is worth the inconvenience.
1,Travels of March Polo,"I kept wondeering when I was going to read Marco P{olo's accounts, not a summation of what he had written."
2,"wast of money,","G'day a usless read tell's little, even for a child, would not get any thing like this again. Cheers Joseph"
4,Bonus Points for Visual Style,"Marco Polo's memoir of his life and travels in the medieval Asian empire of Kublai Khan is the ultimate adventure tale, a true one-of-a-kind. As a teenager, Marco Polo, scion of a Venetian trading family, embarked on a two-decade adventure into the remotest corners of the known world through his family's connection with the Great Khan and his court. Year later, (after dictating his story in a prison back in civilized Europe), Polo published a dazzling account of sights he witnessed in lands little known to Europeans of the Middle Ages. So extraordinary and exotic were his reports, that Polo's tales both fired imaginations and inspired skepticism. For the modern reader, the book offers a fascinating picture of a lost world and a sense of ultimate adventure. One element that makes this an appealing edition of an opt-published classic is the use of 32 woodcut illustrations by Witold Gordon originally created for a 1930 edition of the book."
1,Acid paper problems?,"I need to know from someone how / whether to trust Penguin / Viking, or any other publisher, regarding the use of acid paper in their editions? If this Viking edition of Marco Polo is printed on acid paper -- as was the 1972 Penguin Classics edition which I need it to replace -- then I recommend strongly that no one buy this. My 1972 edition reeks -- the fumes pouring from it now make my eyes smart and my nose tingle so badly that I can't read the book -- and the pages are so yellow that they are becoming difficult to read, and so brittle that they break just from the pressure of my thumb as I turn them. I don't want to make the same mistake again, with Penguin or with Penguin / Viking -- so before I buy their and Latham's otherwise - excellent edition, I need to know if its paper is acidic. How to find this out? If it is ""acid"" paper, or if I can't find out, there are other ""Marco Polos"" around..."
2,Travels Into My Own Personal Hell,"I was unfortunate enough to be assigned this book as required reading for a college course of mine and boy, did it blow. The text lacks any interesting voice or information. Due to recent advances in technology, this book is no longer relevant as we are already well informed as to the geography of the planet. While the author's intentions are admirable, the translated archaic Italian is difficult at best. I rid myself of outdated texts, let's add this one to the pile."
1,Disappointed in Pennsylvania,"This is a big disappointment for a Kitchen Aid product. The first time I used it my hand got burned and I had a big mess to clean up. When the water in the reservoir heats up and begins to boil, the top of the reservoir pops open and water flies everywhere. It has to be weighted down before starting, and takes a very long time for a small pot to brew. I thought the quality of this product was very poor."
2,"Disgruntled by the ""Dribbler""","My first review of this product was glowing, but that was only after one or two times of use. Now, after owning it for several weeks, I must say I regret the purchase. Even at the low price, the dribble problem of the carafe is a real headache!The quality of the coffee produced is excellent, so I have given two stars. The quality of the carafe however, is very shoddy. The carafe dribbles when it is used to fill the water tank, and it dribbles when pouring coffee. I have tried pouring slow, pouring fast, and it almost always DRIBBLES. I constantly find myself wiping up water or coffee off my countertop.I have yet to try another brand of 4-cup coffeemaker, but I may very well do so. I like the coffee savings with a smaller pot, but surely there is a maker that will produce a good cup o' Joe without the mess.Avoid this one -- save your money and try another brand!"
1,This CANNOT be a Kitchen Aid Product,"Well, the coffee maker says ""Kitchen Aid"" and the box and the user manuals say ""Kitchen Aid"", but this product CANNOT be a Kitchen Aid product because ""Kitchen Aid"" is synonymous with quality and overall kitchen fabulousness. This coffee maker both dribbles and downpours when you pour and the so-called ""pause"" mechanism more abbreviates than pauses leaving you with a pool of coffee sizzling on the burner. It's a good thing I'm crazy about my other Kitchen Aid products, because if this coffee maker had been my first Kitchen Aid experience, I'd wonder what all the hype was about. So I'm convinced this product must be a doppelganger. It's the only explanation."
3,Not the best,"I bought this little coffeemaker less than a year ago .... At first it was great, except for the difficulty in pouring from the carafe. Coffee stayed hot and tasted great. However, in less than a year the warming plate has lost its non-stick feature and the machine started leaking dirty water from the bottom. This morning all it did was leak clean water and never brewed.I've been in touch with Kitchenaid and learned this model is no longer being manufactured. They are replacing it with a 12 cup programmable model KCM400B. I'm just concerned about the size as the 4-cup fit in a small space."
2,It's like a dribble-cup,"Other reviews commenting on the fact that the carafe dribbles whenever you pour coffee are correct. We constantly have coffee puddles now on our counter and floor. This is shame too, as I like the coffee from this maker better than that from my old Mr. Coffee machine."
5,exactly what i was looking for,"It's a weight, it fits on my bar. Really cheap. Couldn't have possibly asked for anything more. Would order again."
2,Olympic Weight Doesnt fit Olympic Bar.,"I have an entire set of CAP Olympic Weights and needed one additional 5 lb plate as I somehow lost the other. Those are great and I have no issue with them whatsoever. This CAP plate appears to have missed Quality Control. The inner ring with the hole was not shaved appropriately and there were tiny ""bumps"" of iron - therefore making it impossible to slide onto the barbell. Rather than return it, I just decided to write it off as a loss. I just wont buy online anymore."
5,Just what I needed!,"This weight plate came as described, fits perfectly onto my 2"" barbell. I ordered 2 more of another weight just like these."
1,What a piece of junk,"I bought the Cruzer3 with the intention of only occasionally using it. I've used it only a handful of times and it's already falling apart, won't hold a charge, and the foil already has huge holes in it.What a waste of money."
4,Decent shaver for the money,"This shaver will produce a close shave if you're willing to spend some time going over the same areas many times. However, a quick pass usually produces a shave that's close enough to suit me. The thing I really like about this shaver is the dual trimmer and the snap-on guard for beard trimming. It's very convenient."
2,Utterly Ruubish,"well to be honest, I took my chances while purchasing this product, after reading all the bad reviewsI took it basically for trimming and it doesnt work.Totally useless product, its all the hype, totally not worth it"
2,Buy the 2838 instead!,"If you really need something better, buy the cruzer 4 2838. It isn't sold in the USA but you can find it online. Twice the price of the 2865, but 10 times better. Check it!"
5,He loves it!!,I gave this to my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves it. He has a gotee and he really likes how well it shaves around his facial hair.
3,electric razor,"This razor works alright as a shaver. Not as close as manual razors. It's trimmer works ok for a while. But it pulls a bit on the hair after a while, which hurts. It's nice to have the electric razor as it's convenient."
3,It's ok...,"Not the best electric shaver I have ever used, but it works ok. Sometimes I have to go back over with an actual razor to get everything."
2,Beard trimmer is horrible!,"I was very dissapointed, i was under the impression that this thing would trim beards effectivelly. I think I have better using a pair of sissors to trim my bear!This product gets 2 rabbles"
1,Worst shaver ever,"As soon as I tried it I wanted to return it. I had a 5-day beard, the shaver would fail to cut most of it, only small spots were shaved. After 10 minutes going over and over it, the result was horrible. I gave up and used my razor.It just does not work."
1,Worst razor I have ever owned. Going back to Remington.,Doesn't give a smooth close shave. Takes twice as long to get shaven as it does with my Remington.The trimmer is virtually useless.Very disappointed because Braun has the reputation of producing quality items. This is not one of them!
2,Would not recommend,"I bought this item for my husband, he had an old Norelco that worked great but was not charging anymore. His main complaint with the Braun is that it will not shave his neck, but it does fine with his face. I did read other reviews that had similar complaints, and I wish I had listened and bought something different. I hope this is helpful."
2,not worth it,"This shaver did not live up to my expectations from reading other reviews.I have used a remington microscreen foil shaver for over 20 years (2 different units) and thought I would try something different. Big mistake! This Braun looks nice, feels nice but that's it. It takes at least 5 minutes to repeatedly go over my face to finally cut all the hair down to a decent close shave. My old razor would do it in under 2 minutes. Hopefully my regret will not be yours also."
3,"Not bad, not great","I've had the shaver for about a month now and used it like 3 or 4 times. I am satisfied with it's operation and capabilities, but do see some shortfalls. Gripe no. 1, the trimmer for full beards leaves something to be desired as the teeth seem a little light and you have to make a number of passes over the beard to get a good trim. Since it does an alright job on with the initial first pass, you have to follow that up with a hunt for individual hairs the trimmer might have missed and touch up the whole beard.Gripe no. 2, the shaver also give me problems shaving under my chin right around where the jaw meets the neck, forcing me to do a once over with my razor to get it truly clean.One of my favorite things is the mini side of the trimmer as it makes certain detail work much easier."
1,Money down the drain,"Bought this as my first electric shaver.After spending a frustrating 20 minutes trying to shave 3-day old stubble, only to find it had only shaved a few patches, returned to the instruction manual, assuming I must be doing something wrong. Re-read, attempted again, same problem. Read these reviews and realised that this shaver is, essentially, a waste of money. For an item that touts itself on its flexibility, this is nothing short of a rip-off."
4,cruzer z-50,"The new Braun Cuzer I just purchased is perfect and amazon got it to me in under a week, great deal and great shaver."
1,bad purchase,"This shaver is a big disappointment! It takes more to shave with it than with foam and blade...Shaving quality is low, even if you patiently try to cut all the beard that is left by the main razor with the trimmer."
1,Waste of Money,I hate this machines they work only for couple of months and then cause a lot of wounds while shaving and not practical at all
5,Perfect shaver,"I used the first Braun Cruzer 2000 which is a four year old product and have loved it every use. The Razor begun to turn blunt so I bought this instead and I am very happy. The trimmer works perfect and the small trimmer head is very versatile, more then I thought it would be.Great purchase, will recommend it for everyone!"
4,"Very good shaver, so-so trimmer","I've owned a few Braun shavers before, and have always thought them very good. The Cruzer is no exception - it's a good shaver. It's so-so as a trimmer. It's rated 100~240V, so it will be good in several countries. I'd give it a 5 as a shaver and a 3 as a trimmer, so it gets a 4 overall."
1,Doesn't last long....,"Great idea. Bad quality. It has some issues cutting long hair but you have the trimmer/whatever. Well, tonight the trimmer chocked and died on me on my beard. Basically the blades got enough ""hair inside"" that something got suck and stopped moving. I have had this product for about 4-6 months.Sorry but if a product is aimed at trimming beards/goatees, etc also, I expect it to work *and last*. Didn't.Went back to my Norelco for a second to finish my shave (it runs low on batteries even at full charge for being old) and I was surprised how much better even in non-trimmer mode it grabbed longer hair.My disappointment is that Norelco doesn't make an ""all in one"" product like this anymore. They charge high, but I have to say, they work better, and I think this is the first and last Braun shaving product I buy.Hint to Braun: you have the right idea. But it needs to last. Even if that means charging $20 USD more for it."
3,Nice shave but takes longer,"This shaver gives a nice clean cut, however it seems to take over twice as long as my last Braun shaver. My previous Braun has two heads while this one only has one. At the time, I didn't give it much thought, but in retrospect, I would have sought after one which had two. All in all, paying an extra $30 for one of the nicer Brauns would have been a better idea."
5,"Basic, but very nice","This is a great product. For the price this is a multi-tasking must for those with beards, goatees, etc."
2,not that good,"design seems great...but does not shave very close, even the trimmers seem a little dull..disappointed"
2,A Clunky Shave,"I purchased this shaver as a Christmas gift for my husband thinking I was getting quite a deal for my money. The washable and worldwide voltage features are definitely a huge plus. Also, the 5 minute quick charge feature - for a man who ALWAYS forgets to plug the darn thing in until 5 minutes before he has to shave - seem a perfect fit. Unfortunately, all the impressive extras in the world don't really amount to much when the main function of the device - giving a close and comfortable shave - doesn't work. According to my husband, it's jumpy, clunky and leaves stubble and clumps of hair where you're meant to have a clean cut.If you're looking for a shaver for yourself or the man in your life, I'd recommend looking elsewhere. You'd probably be better off with a 20 shaver and a separate trimmer that actually work, rather than this fancy machine that can't even perform its basic task."
2,"Takes forever to trim, now after some time it even hurts!","It seems that you always have to avoid all in one solutions, they keep doing everything bad"
5,Does what it is supposed to do,"This is a very well made product. The parts fit well, the trimmer does a good job and it feels nice in the hands. Overall, a Braun."
2,Look Elsewhere,"I was attracted to this razor because of its multi-functionality, but dont buy it unless you want to spend forever in the bathroom trying to trim up... This thing is the most inefficient trimming device I have ever seen."
1,crappy shave... and trimmer/ shaper,"I have been using this razor for 1 month. Takes about 20 minutes to get an unclean shave. Trimmer doesn't trim very well. Plus, foil makes it difficult to see what your shaping"
5,"Finally, a combo razor that works","I have battled with blades, razors and beard trimmer for years. Finally, here's a machine that does it all. This not only will cut through your mangled, knotty beard to a nice stubble, it will also take that stubble down to nothing. The single foil edge makes shaving a breeze. My entire chin gets cleaned up without a problem. I highly recommend it."
3,Doesn't work for me.,"Maybe my facial hair is thick/plentiful but i find this shaver really struggles to get the job done. With some effort it can be done however. After a couple months of usage I wanted to throw it away because it started to pull on my hair instead of cutting it, and this was even on areas where hair wasn't thick. I'll chalk it up to a bad egg because everyone else here seems to love this shaver. Certainly not me, it's the worst I ever had."
2,don't be fooled by the slick exterior,"As nifty as it looks, this razor is surprisingly second-rate. Unlike my previous Braun razor (from 1999), this shaver doesn't even have a 'lock' setting. And since the on-button is very touch-sensitive, it's practically a guarantee that it'll accidentally go off in your luggage. Whose idea was that?Also, I find I have to go over the same area several times for it to be shaved to my satisfaction. Sure, it has a beard trimmer (which I barely use), but lots of other, assuredly better razors have them too. Without the sucking."
1,Avoid this item,"Another reviewer rated the closeness as fair.I would have to agree as it was not anywhere close to good.But, I got this shaver to trim my beard.It does not trim beards at all. Facial hair cannot reach the micro-screen. It may be a good gift if you hate someone.I will be returning mine, as it does a bad job as a shaver, and does not trim beards.I am very dissapointed now since I've been waiting for a while to get one and received this as a gift. It was hard to tell the giftor that it didn't work. Don't waste your time with this shaver."
1,Not worth the plastic it doesn't trim through.,"I picked this up hoping to use it a few times a week and keep a short beard. What I got was a pain in the neck. Unless you want to keep a lumberjack length beard, this is not the trimmer for you. The attachments do not give you a close trim and the razor itself only worked for about 4 months before it started cutting me through the foil. And I'm not even talking through holes in the foil. I come away from using the razor with scrapes all over my face on a daily basis. Save your money and invest in a higher quality product."
3,"Thumbs up for convenience, thumbs down for closeness","Like another reviewer, this razor replaced a decade old Norelco lift-and-cut shaver. Perhaps I've just been spoiled by that, but seeing as my 10+ year old razor with 10+ year old blades gave me a closer shave in half the time as this brand new fancy gizmo (the old Norelco didn't even have the problem with an extra-day's growth that this one does), I'm rather disappointed in that aspect.That said, I do like everything else about it. It's a really convenient size, adequate clippers, and the beard trimmer does the job. If you're looking for precise control of beard length, go get a dedicated trimmer, however, because the 4 settings just don't offer the exact control you might want. I'm also very impressed with the batter life.If you're looking for a real close shave from an electric, don't bother. If you're looking for something that does a better than adequate job, has a lot of useful features, and is reasonably priced, this is a good option."
3,"Great Shave, So So trimmer","I really should know better. You never buy anything that claims it takes care of all your needs. I really was in the market for a new beard trimmer as my old Norelco had finally died. I had also planned to buy on of the more expensive self-cleaning Braun's later on. But I saw this and thought I would kill two birds with one stone. No such luck, the shaver part works great and am very happy with it (but would have rather had the self-cleaning model) The beard trimmer part does not work that well. Took several passes to trim my beard evenly, and if your going for that stubble look it does not trim close enough. Even my 6-year-old Norelco took only one pass. I will use this as my primary razor for a few months till I can afford to buy the more expensive self-cleaning model. Then use this as my travel razor as it is one unit to pack instead of 2.Save the money and buy a sole beard trimmer and a sole shaver. You will be much happier and feel less taken by marketing."
4,I got the Massage!,"What a strange (but fun) little book. Naipaul's intermixing the patois with normal Brit-speak was fascinating. Since education, or lack thereof, is a recurring theme, you never knew who fit where on that spectrum. The characters are a hoot. Though the story takes place in Trinidad, their interactions could be taken from Small Town Anywhere.This is a quick read and there are many laughs in store for you."
3,Less than Nobel,"My review of this book probably reflects more negatively on the reviewer than it detracts from the Nobel prize winning author, but 3 stars is all I could squeeze out. It was a nice low key whimsical tale, with pretty good character development, acquainting us with the simple, humorous, pretentious characters making up Trinidad Indian society. Ganesh's rise from a bumbling boy, to a sought-after mystic, to an important polititian, has some lessons in it I suppose (value of education, power of and hunger for spirituality, and the dulling of the spiritual by world, wealth, and fame). But this book did not leave me crying out ""Nobel Prize!"" (as did Pramoedian Ananta Toer's recently released books). A quick read, view of Trinidad culture, and a few chuckles. So not bad - maybe 3 1/2 stars."
1,tricked by the picture,"I didn't get so lucky enough to have read the customer reviews and I ordered 2 of them thinking I was getting 10 batteries! I am now fighting with Amazon over this, asking them to right the issue by sending me the 10 batteries and fixing the picture. I think I'm talking to someone in India, so we'll see how far I get...."
3,A typical problem,"I'm always surprised how badly organized and presented most chess books are, and this book is no exception.There are 3 main opening objectives, speedy development,central control and king safety. Therefore there should only be 3 main chapters. However, Gary Lane's book has 9, which obviously means that most of these should be sub-sections of 3 main chapters relating to the 3 opening objectives, not chapters in their own right. For instance, Chapter 1, called Greedy Openings. is mainly about pawn grabbing at the expense of development, so it should be a sub-section of a chapter relating to development, not a chapter in its own right.However, most of the games are very instructive, although the sparse commentary frequently misses the most important aspectsof these games."
1,Broke in 2 days,Very poor quality product: it broke in only 2 days. Now I am buying the string ones hoping they will last longer...
5,Still going strong after eight years,"Just don't use it on the stovetop! It should be obvious, but mine got put on the stove at one point. The plastic handle started to smoke a bit and there was no serious damage done.Makes good tea, easy to see the progress of the brewing. Cleans easily as well. Not used daily though."
3,moood lifter,I find this music very uplifting when I need to have my spirits uplifted. A soak in the tub glass of wine and Jazz Around Midnight is a little slice of heaven to take away the days troubles and wash them down the drain. Soo any time I need a lift I just pop in Jazz Around Midnight.
3,Proceed With Caution!,"Ok, first of all, esoteric is one of the dopest mc's in hip hop today. Dangerous Connection was a solid album and The Soul Purpose, in my view, is in my top 5 hip hop cd's of all time, a classic. So when I saw this in the shops I had to pick it up. What I got was a letdown. No doubt there are glimpses of what makes 7l and esso the great duo they are, but on some of the tracks the beats arent too great and the main thing that was a letdown for me was the subject matter...thugs...murder blah blah blah,,,forgettable stuff really,,,so proceed with caution everyone!!! I for one hope they stop playin round with their pee pees and get back on track for their next album,,,everyone, go buy The Soul Purpose!!"
4,this is boston's finest,"This album is dope. Especially the first five or so track are amazing. I didn't expect that level of brilliance could be maintained throughout the album and it isn't. After the first five tracks, there are some good songs interspered between song not so great ones. This ablum has eighteen songs and the intro is just a skit but the rest is all music. Eso's lyircs have grown and the lyrics as well as the beat are very ecclectic from mellow tracks to hype energy filled tracks. This is one of the best undergound albums of 2004 if not the best. I would definately reccomend this one!"
4,Marvellous toy for learning,"Play food is fantastic! My 2.5 year old daugther loves it. She loves this set - she is able to take her favourite teddy or doll for a picnic outside or on the carpet in the lounge room. She likes to put things on plates, help teddy eat them and pretends to eat herself. It helps her to recognise food, learn their names, their colours and shapes. She likes to carry everything in the basket, or set it all up on plates like at dinner. Playfood is a great toy to have around the house for imaginative play and indestructable. This is a toy that will be played with!"
4,Realistically Fun~,"Bought this for my toddler whom loves to go on picnics with older sibling. The food is so realistic, I keep picking up the chips off the floor before realizing they are not real!! Very sturdy and fun."
5,Great! Realistic!,"My two daughter got this set and another similar one about a year ago and they are both fantastic! The food is realistic looking. If there is one laying on the floor, sometimes I have to do a double take! All the neighborhood kids play with them, too and they are still in excellent shape. They still look like the day we got them. Even the 11 and 12 year old neighbors love to play with these toys (with the little ones, of course) :) I think they are worth the price!"
4,Wonderful spice rack,"I bought this as a gift for a friend of mine, not really knowing what to expect from the reviews insofar as the spices are concerned. First of all, he loved it! We did, however, throw out many of the spices that we'll never use and re-labeled the jars to make it easier to read and select what we wanted.It was nice to have the spices along with the rack, but we already had so many in our cupboard, that it would have been better to have it come with empty bottles, since we felt guilty throwing them out. We, too, found that many basic spices were missing from the mix they provided. The reorganization took about three hours, including soaking off the old labels and putting on our own, refilling and washing the bottles, etc. BUT we now have a beautiful spice rack that holds almost every single spice we could ever imagine using. It makes you want to cook more often. A great gift."
3,Spices,"The appearance of the spice holder is great. It goes very well with my kitchen. I would prefer the jars coming empty so I can fill them with the spices that I normally use. I will probably be throwing away about half of the spices. The basic spices such as cinnammon, onion powder, garlic powder, dry mustard, allspice, and black pepper are missing. Also, the shaker holes are very large and should be smaller."
3,Okay HK Action Film is Worth a Rental,"Rented this for $1 and so wasn't expecting too much. I fast forwarded through parts of it. Good (but not great) action sequences. Not in the same league as Jackie Chan, Jet Li, Donnie Yen, etc."
1,WTF?,"The box art and trailer and even the title imply a dark brooding film in which an assassin takes revenge. instead it's a sub par goofball pseudo comedy, that is neither funny nor entertaining. The box art succeeded in being totally fallacious, as it does not reflect the nature of this garbage at all. Hideous, lame and even the pastel color schemes used by the production designer all serve to make this the ultimate headache. Wish i could get a full refund. Hideous."
2,Must use tabbed paper,"I got this as a gift, and while I was impressed with it at first, I later realized after a lot of printing and trying different options and finally calling their support, that I cannot print 4x6 images on 4x6 paper. If I want a 4x6 image, I have to print on 4x6 paper *with* a tab. The printer will always leave 1/2 inch blank on the paper. I'm very surprised about this and still have trouble believing it. This means that I have to resize each print by hand if I want it to print correctly on this paper (by default it just cuts it off). Maybe another reviewer can confirm this? Apparently with the bigger printers you can use non-tabbed paper and have it print on the whole thing, but not with the small printers."
3,Pretty good printer ruined by print stickiness problem,"I have had this for about a year - great looking results, especially if corrected and printed from a good software package. The stickiness problem seems insurmountable. I have tried several different papers and drying times up to 3 weeks, but they will always stick to photo album transparent material (have tried several brands). I wish HP would sought this problem out - also occurs with prints from other HP printer models. Finally bought a Cannon Selphy dye-sub printer which does not have this problem."
3,It's OK,The printer was good but the ink that came with the printer was so old it would not work. Had to buy a new ink cartridge.
2,DISAPPOINTED IN HP!,"BUYER BEWARE!This printer does NOT accept MEMORY FLASH DRIVES.They provide a CD to set up the printer on your computer, but there is no USB cord to connect the printer to the computer!Standard digital camera cords are too small.Printer is not compatible with Windows Vista Home! So that means I cannot install this printer to my computer!I think I will be returning it!"
5,Hp PhotoSmart 245 Compact Printer,"This little printer Rocks!!! It is easy to use, compact and totally portable. The print quality is awsome...it prints a photo in about 60-90 seconds. It accepts all newer digital camera media. You can preview your photos on a 2"" screen. Also, you can print a sheet with 2 photos, 4, 6, 8, 24. Hewlett Packard does it again. The quality, and good price is the best selling point. Many acessories available."
2,HP PhotoSmart 245,"This printer is quick with its printing and easy to use but the quality of prints is mediocre at best. line quality and color produced is a has a hazy quality especially in darker photo's, the prints also take HOURS to dry (even after a day the prints are extremely prone to fingerprints and anything also that could stick to them. I purchased this printer and used it with each of my 3 digital cameras (canon sd100, pentax optio330 and kodak easyshare) and couldn't get good results. I have returned mine and IM currently seeking an alternative."
1,False Paper Jam,"Bad .... this is the second HP PhotoSmart printer I've owned and I had to return it the store for a new one. When they work ... they work great. But like my first PhotoSmart, this one had to be returned for a replacement due to an inherent design flaw (firmware). The printer works fine for a while. In this case, two days. Then it started giving an erroneous 'print jam' error when in fact there was nothing causing the jam. HP said to return to store for new or refund. I keep wondering when HP is going to fix this problem?"
2,"Jams easily, way too expensive per print","Pros: 4x6 near-pro-quality prints, LCD preview, compact form factorCons: slow!!!, prints can fade quickly, paper feed jams frequently, high cost per print (~65 cents not including cost of printer!), questionable manufacture qualityRecommendation: wait for the new 25-cents-per-print Epson PictureMate printer, with better quality (according to PC Magazine) and much lower operating costs."
1,100% GARBAGE,"This printer started giving me the infamous ""invisible paper jam"" error after about one year...I would give this product negative stars if I could. It is absurdly overpriced.I've been subjected to HP's crap products both at work and at home...and in my opinion, ""HP"" is just another word for ""junk"". DO NOT BUY."
3,"Not bad, but a bit overrated","Nobody Gets the Girl is a decent comic book novel. For what it's worth, it's entertaining and has somewhat interesting characters although they sometimes get a bit cliche. I don't think the book deserves all of the 5 star reveiews it has gotten on Amazon. Maxey's prose style while serviceable is hardly enthralling. The storyline is solid but not extraordinary. In the end, I would rather have spent my time reading a few good graphic novels."
3,"Good book, but there's better out there.","As a fan of just about any super-hero book, my review is from a rosy-glasses perspective. I enjoyed it. It was an easy read, the plot was pretty good, but at times it seemed to go off topic. There were parts of the book that had no reason to be there or any tie in to the overall plot at all. I also agree with one of the other reviewers that the romantic part came out of thin air and didn't seem to fit. I just started reading 'Other People's Heroes' and think that's a better book."
4,Good book and Other book recommendations,I liked the book.These are some similar books which you might enjoy:-Confessions of a D-List Supervillan (Jim Bernheimer)A story of an underdog anti-hero.-Ex-Heroes (Peter Clines)Superhumans vs Zombies. Post-apocalyptic. Trilogy.
3,Superhero Realism,An interesting take on the world of superheroes. Limited in scale with an eye to making both hero and villain as flawed and real as possible. While I think it's very well done and accomplished the writers goal it lacks something. All the characters seem comfortable with the idea that the end justifies the means. It makes bonding with the hard as I didn't really like them. In the end it missed the morale center that most comic books have. Again well written but not for me. I do highly recommend Devil's Cape if your looking for a good superhero novel.
4,Get past the title!,"For months I avoided this book. Because if nobody gets the girl, why should I be interested? Happily my fears were unjustified. But no other spoiler here. It is indeed a comic book novel, and I was surprised to find that, for me, it was a much fun as many graphic novels I've read. And a better deal if you measure dollars per fun reading time.I will say that the Kindle version seems to be missing the full size cover art, which would have been fun to have."
3,Not a bad read...,"It is a pretty good story and a quick read. Overall I liked it and thought it was worth the money. The only things I didn't like about the book was that there was not enough character development. The main character kind of zooms through the story without every making the reader really care about him. Usually with characters that feel so flat I don't finish the book, however the storyline was strong enough to keep me reading."
2,SLOW Shipping,Even if they say that they have it in stock - they will take 2 weeks to ship it. You can have Margaritas sometine this winter.
5,The Unsung Season,"The book was a joy to read. Focuses on about thirty gardeners who have distinguished themselves with their winter gardens. Covers different styles and techniques as well as the lifestyles of the gardeners. As much about the people as the gardens themselves. Handy appendix includes selected plant, shrub, and tree lists as well as dye plants and plants for attracting birds. I found the book inspiring and the bright photos motivating."
5,One of most enlightening performances on screen ever made...,"After spending more than half of his life in solitary, when a convict (sentenced for having killed 2 people) says: ""Life is one of the most precious gift and its the duty of life to live"", one wonders if redemption was over or not for him. Though, he never came out of the prison, but redemption in the sense of understanding the meaning of life certainly unfolded to this ornithologist, who became a self-taught authority on curing bird's diseases while serving life-sentence. This movie is an amazing depiction of a true story, about dedication, perseverance and relentless pursuit of ""free thinking"" from a prisoner-turned-author."
5,They don't make movies like this anymore!!,"Being in my fifties, I've watched this movie roughly 10 times over the yrs, but it gets better each time. This is my first DVD of the film, and the quality is very good. Thanks"
5,The Birdman of Alcatraz,"This was an excellent movie!! I have always been curious about prisons. This movie is in black and white whichmakes it all the more real. It touches on topics like prison reform, self identity, relationships , andspiritual awareness, Life is a gift!! The acting was superb by Lancaster. You could see the transformation of hate andanger to a gentler soul!! His connection with birds allowed this transformation. I Highly recommend the movie!!"
3,"Good Movie, Undeserving Fame","Yes, I liked this movie. However, I believe that this is one of those instances where the subject (person) wasn't deserving of having his horn blown by anyone. Yes, he did good by birds. But the man was a savage killer who deprived two families (including a guard's) of a loved one forever. More factual accounts of Stroud's behavior in prison clearly show he was a sociopath, a sexual predator, and an unrepentent killer (notice how there are never any apologies by Stroud for what he did). And then he whines to the warden about how he's told what to do and when to do it.Sorry, but he strikes me as a self-absorbed killer with no regard for anyone else."
1,Poor Murderer!,A pathetic attempt by Hollywood to whip up sympathy for a double murderer who managed to use a chemistry set to save the lives of a few birds. What about the people he killed?
3,Great Film but a fouled premise,"The man deserved to be locked up and have the key melted down.A typical 1960's feel sorry for the criminal film. You never hear about the people and their families who were hurt by this evil man. He was tried and convicted for a reason, even this film can't make the case that he got a raw deal. Considering the time and place. The prison system and Warden were very decent to him.Anywhere else and he would of had a necktie party within the year of his killing his victim."
3,check the region,"I was not able to view the movie on my tv, had to use computer, so I could change region, film was for a region outside of united states. might be kind of important to send cd for correct region in future. Be Careful!"
4,Good so far,"I listened to the streaming audio files and liked what I heard. Rob's other albums are great too, especially some of his earlier work with ""Red Shoes"". Heard for the first taime and saw him live in Denver 17 years ago. Still my favorite Jazz performer."
3,Outdated advice,This book has become quite outdated as dating has changed a lot since it was written. Now the main dating sites are Facebook and other similar social networking sites. This book needs to be revised to include these social networking sites and explain to the reader about how to meet people on these sites.
4,Fantastic Guide,"I couldnt put the book down, there is some fantastic insights into improving your success in online dating. great book"
5,Cool book!,"What a cool book! Online dating is pretty much what everyone is doing....and who knows how to navigate through the mess? The book tells it all!Fun to read - and easy to understand. I have told all my college friends to get this book. And, there's free coupons included which basically make the book free, in the long run.Get this book if you want to know what you are doing in this crazy dating world."
3,For People Uncomfortable with Computers?,"Most of what this book says is either common sense or easy to find out by using an online dating service. They sound uncomfortable enough with computers that they seem to expect readers to prefer reading a generic description on paper to reading the online descriptions that the dating services provide.Their idea of backing up email is to print it out.They say on page 183 that meeting in person gives away your anonymity completely, then on page 237 they describe how to meet in person anonymously. That is fairly typical about how carefully they write.Instead of this, I recommend buying Katz's I Can't Believe I'm Buying This Book."
2,Not really what I wanted,"This was hard to get through. Thought it could have been better organized/user friendly. If you have time and want to put a lot of effort into making a big decision, this can help. They should make a computer program based on their strategies, because it looks complicated, like a lot of work to do it yourself and know which one to use for which kind of decision. But if you want a book on general decision making (I'm indecisive in general and was looking for ways to help that in general), this probably isn't the right book. I don't know what is."
2,NOT FOR THE ORDANIRARY READER,Lots of technical jargon. No humour in writting style.Extreamly dry. Dont explore the emotional aspect of decision making.Good for business people.Not us.
5,"Easy to use, powerful in application","_Smart Choices_ is a rarity: a work of solid, rigorous analysis which is simple to read and easy to put into practice. Raiffa and his colleagues have written a lot of brilliant work - this one is the first I've seen which is accessible to the layman. I loved it."
4,"Great book, good information","The content is great and I recommend it. You might also be interested in ""The Art of the Long View"". If you've already read that one, then ""Smart Choices"" is a good follow up. It provides a format framework for making choices and shows how to generate alternatives and make trade-offs"
3,interesting but complicated,"This book might be helpful for someone people but a waste of time for others. I thought it was interesting but most of things written in it are common sense. It tells you how to make a smart decision by providing steps and tips to little by little make the right choice but i just don't agree with some of the material because sometimes choices are made by just following your gut and not thinking every little consequence through. That's just my opinion. But if you're someone who has a hard time making choices, this book is right for you."
4,Practical Guide Based on Research,"Many have written extensive reviews on this book that I believe are accurate. Using the relevant decision research, the authors have successfully produced this accessible guide. The book is a practical introduction to decisions for anyone interested in approaching problems in business and life in a structured manner. While footnotes do not appear, related research confirms the validity of the authors' methods. For an introduction into the research, I recommend the Harvard Business Review on Decision Making from the HBS Press that includes a paper by the authors detailing the even swap method.My only criticism is the compressed feel of the text particularly in the ""Uncertainty"" and ""Linked Decisions"" chapters. For most of the book, the authors did an outstanding job of condensing a great deal of information into a flowing, informative book."
3,"It's gold alright, but not gloss. Oh well!","Not much to say. I was hoping to find a glossy ""lacquer"" type gold finish in a spray can and I was disappointed. It was gold, but that was as close to what I needed as it came."
3,Good book but get's off the subject a lot,"If you've already read Michelle's autobiography this book is just a repeat. There was some info I didn't know about Michelle but very little. In my opinion, the book talked too much about other skaters. Some info in there was not necessary. Michelle Kwan fans out there, this book is better for people who want a mix of other famous athletes. I'm an MK fan and I was a little disappointed. If any of you haven't read Michelle's autobiography yet, you are better off getting it instead."
1,Written like a bad soap opera,This was written like a bad soap opera. Details are over the top and too dramatic and the writing style goes over the top. The message becomes too obvious and just too much! There's a reason people are willing to sell this book for a penny. Not worth reading.
1,Slightly informing and incredibly brief,"If you want to learn about Michelle Kwan, a girl who worked hard for her dreams, you're not getting it. You will read about Michelle Kwan, ice skating star. The book has one page, that's one measly page, of information BESIDES Michelle. I am writing a report on Michelle, and I am having the HARDEST time extracting information from this book. All it focuses on is her awards and later accomplishments. Where is all the information about her youth life? COULDN'T FIND IT!"
4,inresting facts i found about her that i had never known,the book was intresting and full of things really never told on a television event.
2,This is a merely a quickie celebrity bio,"This is a rather silly and useless book. Epstein is merely trying to cash in on the many dollars figure skating generates. You will learn nothing here about Michelle Kwan that you can't read in a news article or her own autobiography. Epstein constantly goes off into tangets about other celbrities from Tiger Woods to Princess Diana. If you are a fan of Michelle Kwan read her autobiography, skip this book."
4,Amusing and Educational,"Although not a side-splitting, Fawlty Towers type of romp, ""Running A Hotel . . ."" is nonetheless a funny and yet informational book and I'm glad I finally had the chance to read it. M. LeSeuer deftly and often humorously exposes and enlightens the reader to some of the mystery that is Tibet. He also treats the political and cultural climates of that time very ably, with a keen awareness of the delicate balances needed to maintain the working and social environments harmonious during trying times. I learned a great deal about Tibet from this book and recommend it highly. Even though it was published about 10 years ago, the writing and the narrative detail remain fresh and entertaining."
4,Fun games in a nice metal tin...,"This is some nice entry level games that we were able to play with our five year old daughter today. A lot of fun for us!! I also love the fact that they come in this nice tin. The downside.... the durablilty of the cards and boxes. They are super cheap and thin. My daughter has sweaty palms and each one of her cards was wet; even when you were mixing them. She was also bending them very easily.This is a nice set because in each box there is the directions, the cons are the actual cards durability. Give it a try at this price."
3,Card are TINY,"Yes I read the reviews as I always do before buying. And the reviews always sway me, I see one negative and I say ok next option, but I was so excited for my son to play these card games like I did. The tin was a great idea too because cards usually end up all over or a few get lost. I saw that the cards were thin and could bend but I figured that would be ok, my son is gentle and would be able to take good care of them. I just thought they'd be BIGGER! They are way smaller than playing card, which I guess is good for small hands BUT I thought when they said JUMBO that...hello! they would be jumbo (maybe in Munchkinland). I just remember the giant cards when I was younger. Keep looking if you want more durable cards, JUMBO cards."
1,tiny not jumbo,"I purchased this product for my kindergarten class specifically because it was listed as ""4 Jumbo Sized Card Games."" I was quite disappointed in the size of the cards. They are NOT jumbo by any means. In fact, they measure approximately 2-3/4 x 3-1/2. I would NOT have purchased these if I had known how tiny they were."
3,Kidz Dezerve Better,"My daughter is four years old and has taken an interest in card games. There are good skills such as strategic thinking, memory, etc. to be learned from these games.But please! These cards are just a little better than cut up notebook paper. They are so cheaply made. I expected a much more durable product. I later found a better set at Target."
1,Not for younger children,"These cards are not designed for younger children who do not read to use. Ok for 7 yr old, but 5 yr old couldn't figute out how to play because he doesn't read yet"
1,Not jumbo sized!,"I was so excited for these cards & to play Go Fish and Old Maid with my 4 year old. When I got the box, I was SO surprised at how SMALL the decks of cards are. I mean, waaaaay smaller than a regular deck of cards. How is this Jumbo??? It is not easy for little kids, who are just learning to play card games to keep hold of tiny cards (and I do mean tiny). The tin box is ok, but they don't fit in the box nicely at all. you have to pile them on top of each other, so they slide around - why make the box so big when the cards are so small?? Returned for a better item!"
1,Not Jumbo sized!,False advertising! The card decks do not have jumbo sized cards! They are small cards and only good for older children! RIP OFF
3,My3uce3,"I only give this toy a three star overall rating if an adult is willing to play with the children. The cards themselves are of very poor quality. Really thin paper is used. When my 3 year old got a hold of a stack for just 30 seconds, a couple of cards bent up really quick. This would definitely be an item to be used with adult interaction only. The tin that they come in is nice for storage and it really looks good/organized in my toy closet!"
2,DECEIVING,"BEWARE these cards are not JUMBO size they are regular sized cards, if not a little smaller!!!! The tin it came in is Jumbo but the cards are not! Not even the print is large! The quality of card is not even impressive. However, The tin is actually nicer than the set."
4,Replacement Lithium-ion Battery for Sanyo RL 4920,"I received the battery before they said I would, it fit the phone, but I had dropped the phone while riding my motorcycle which trashed the OEM battery. There was nothing wrong with battery the phone was now broken and new battery ended up not being need, but over all this was a positive purchase"
5,New life to older phone....,I purchased 2 of these batteries for our Sanyo RL 4920 phones. They were a perfect fit and have performed as the original batteries did for 3 months to date. I would purchase again.
2,worth putting more money into another notebook,30GB and 256 is not a spec for serious notebook user.Asthetically the notebook is good. HP/Compaq support is good.The notebook suffers from higher weight & heat. So much that it not a laptop. You need to put it down lest you burn your lap.
4,Crucial book on civil liberties during wartime,"Neely gives an excellent and detailed review of how civil liberties suffered during the War Between the States. The right of habeas corpus is Neely's main concern, but trials by military commissons and international law are covered among other topics.If you're not a Civil War buff, this book may seem pretty dry. For example, a lot of space is devoted to evaluating the various claims of how many military prisoners there were. While this is important historical data, it made my eyes glaze over and prompted me to skim several sections of the book.Given the post-9/11 discussions of military tribunals and other curtailments of the Bill of Rights, this book is more relevant than ever."
4,between kobo abe and samuel beckett,"old man living on mountain worries about whether a heavy rainstorm will cause a landslide. meanwhile, he occupies himself with articles from an encyclopedia set that sets into relief how little man knows in the present holocene geological period. ""man remains an amateur."" brief, but hefty, yet kind of like beckett-light. also makes me think of kobo abe."
5,Weirdly comforting,"I read this book first as a teen-ager when it appeared in The New Yorker. I kept intending to put it down, it was so strange (especially for a teen-ager), but it was so compelling that I read every word. It has stuck with me ever since -- not as a conscious memory but more as a spiritual one (ick -- sorry -- I usually hate stuff like that, but there it is). What I mean is that it changed my view of the world, making me realize the individual's small place in it, which can be a very comforting realization anytime things go all topsy turvy in your life. Now I am re-reading it at 46 and enjoying it even more; in fact, I am going to give it to my father who is terminally ill. Frisch's book Homo Faber is much different -- a tragic fable with lots or mythic references -- but also excellent. What a writer he was!"
4,Strange and interesting,"This odd little book is essentially the interior monologue--though written in the third person--of an ailing old man in a rural Swiss village beset by dangerous storm. Man, as we're told somewhere along the way, appeared on Earth during the Holocene (present) era, quite late in the history of our tiny planet; the book is haunted with a sense of the infinite smallness and frality of the human race before the utterly impersonal will of nature. Personally, I could have done without all the scientific talk (much of the text is composed of geology articles that the narrator cuts out of various books), but it's still a fairly compelling read."
3,The book is not my style.,"Blackburn doesn't seem to make very many coherent sentences or chapters. I think that his thought process is very interesting, but the book is hard to read because of his poor writing skills, as I judge anyway. He does have some very interesting examples and one-liners throughout the book and I don't regret finishing it at all, so a decent read; but it's certainly not the be all, end all of ethics introductions."
4,"Same content, different title.","It should be noted that Being Good: A Short Introduction to Ethics contains the same content as Ethics: A Very Short Introduction by the same author. New wrapping, that's all. Other than that, it is an extremely good and concise overview of ethics."
3,An introduction to ethics,Not my favorite introduction to ethics; for that I'd start with Frankena's *Ethics*. But this one is written in a livelier style.
3,OK if it's assigned for a class,Interesting approach to ethics. Blatantly sacrilegious. Spends a little more time shooting holes in the Bible than developing an ethical theory. But not super hard to read.
4,Being Good Is Convincing.,"I bought this book on the recommendation of one of my professors, and this combined with a few introductory books on philosophy really helped me gain a full understanding of what ethics really is and how to gain a good grasp on it without using the classic fall back of religion."
1,poor construction,I just got the steamer today. Noticed poor construction of the layering inside the steamer. Would recommend Norpro brand than this. Will send it back.
5,"Joyce Chen 10"" Bamboo Steamer Set","I ordered this for my sister who lives in Springfield, Mo and she loves it and it came in the time that it was said it would arrive and it was in perfect wrapped condition."
5,seems awesome but i need HELP!!,first off the item looks great but my only problem is that it's too big for my frying pan.....i'm not to sure how to really use it other than what the directions said but do you any of you have any advice on what i should buy in order to properly use this item.....thank you in advance
5,Great Addition to my Kitchen,"This is my second steamer, I ruined my first lid on a hot burner. So I ordered this one to replace the lid and actually, I think the construction is better than my previous one. It is made of bamboo... it won't last forever like my Le Creuset cast iron pot. But, I will get a good year or more out of this $15 set. Plus, it fits the layers from my previous steamer, so now I can stack 4 layers.I use this multiple nights a week. I can prepare an entire dinner for my family in it. Fish on one layer, veggies on another... Steam it and serve the entire basket to the table. I usually make rice on the side. Delicious and EASY! We are a microwave free home, eat a plant based diet and I have a three year old. Finding quick and easy meals are tricky for me because we don't eat foods that have been processed... this bamboo steamer is a life saver!If your considering it, go for it."
4,"Nice set, but the size didn't work for my pan","I was bummed that this was too small for my pan, so double check the size of your pan. It is a nice set though."
4,Perfect steamer!!,This steamer is good for me. The only thing I don't like about it is the smell at first.
5,"Simple, inexpensive, and fast...",Been meaning to get one of these for a while and was not disappointed when I finally got around to it. Worked even better than I remembered from years ago. Even my niece volunteered that the vegetables cooked in it tasted better. And things cook so fast you won't believe it.
4,Wonderful Steamer,"This is my second one. The bamboo steamer's cover will not drop the water, which is condensed from the steam, back to the food being cooked which may ruin the texture and flavor of the delicacies. That is the reason why I prefer the bamboo one to the aluminum one."
3,havent used it yet,"i havent used it yet, but i want to make some potstickers with it. i was surprised that it didnt fit my pan very well."
4,Steamer,Works great. As describe and quick deklivery. Allow water to soak into steamer for about 10 min. before start of boil.
2,Shoddy Craftsmanship,"I bought this item for my mom, so it would be easier for her to steam her food. When I opened the box to make sure all the pieces fit and were there I found some flaws. The major problem I have is inside the steamer where the food is placed. The slats are splintered and have large pieces of bamboo ready to fall off. This is not Amazon or the sellers fault because they can not open every box to check the craftsmanship. I would return this item for another but since the price is not too bad and I the fact probably get another the same way, I will try to fix it and buy another from a different manufacturer when it breaks."
5,Can't wait to use,Husband happy to get for Christmas but has not had a chance to use. Getting recipe ideas from a co-worker who uses her a lot.
5,Steam wins over boiled vegetables,"My son is a college student and loves to cook. I bought him a Bamboo steamer several years ago and he used it so much, it needed replaced. I must say, he has brought home steamed buns that were Mmmmmm good! He has told my wife and I that he uses it almost daily for veggies and that they retain great flavor. After he raved this Christmas that he now has two (and he will use both at the same time to cook even more) I decided that my wife needs one.The difference from boiling and steaming food is very different in taste. Steamed fresh veggies retain so much more of its taste, once you try them, you will never boil or microwave again.I have never liked green beans no matter how they are cooked. Trying them steamed changed my mind. Try your least favorite vegetable and you may be surprised how good it is steamed!!!!"
1,Very Fragile and Doesn't Fit Together Well,"I bought this in June to replace a bamboo steamer I'd had for over 10 years. I dropped one of the baskets onto a vinyl NOT tile floor and it shattered. I'm very disappointed that it would break so easily. My old one was woven, not slats and held up for a very long time. It also does not fit together well at all."
2,Slapdash and unprofessional,"Woodward uses his first rate access to poor effect. The book is disorganized, lacks perspective and is bereft of any level of analysis.Woodward's ability to get senior people to talk is unparalleled. It is a pity that he makes no effort to dig beyond what his contacts tell him. Worse, Woodward doesn't bother to add any historical or geopolitical context to the actions he describes. The author's tendency to describe the thoughts and feelings of the participants as though he was a mind reader is suspect at best - and should be left out of any serious work of non-fiction."
2,Old news footage - in words,"I'm only just begining Chapter 6, but my impression so far of the book is that it is heavy on describing the news footage of what most of us have probably already seen and heard on CNN or the FOX News Channel. This is interspersed with situational dialogue involving, of course, the President, Rumsfeld, Rice, etc. I hope it gets better. What I hope to read in the remaining Chapters is information I and the public have not been commonly privy to. That's what an investigative reporter provides, or so I thought."
2,Outdated junk.,"This book was relevant at the time it came out, if nothing for the fact it helped pump the patriotism and zeal to go to war.However now, after we know the true facts, the lies, and the totally corrupt and inept administration running this country - this book serves no purpose. I recommend Bob Woodwards new book, ""Bush at War Part 2: Denial"", where he illustrates in detail how bad this administration has bungled up everything.Skip this one, it is no longer relevant. The only thing Bush is at war with anymore is his own conscience and moral fabric - which is woefully lacking."
1,Blah,"Pretty sure this was a 'Hey Bob, doesn't your contract say you owe us a book this month?' book. I'm going to put it down to contractual obligation because I'd hate to think someone with Woodward's reputation has started to grind out titles for checks.The Commanders was a better read, if you want to pick up a Woodward book worth reading. If you want to hear about Bush At War, turn on your TV..."
2,interesting Insights but borring overall,"This book gives you some iteresting insights into the administration's decisions, but the book starts getting very boring as you read through the first 100-150 pages. Some of the interesting information is new but most has been widely available in the media. Most of the book details NSC meetings, many of which were just plain boring.Jesus Arango"
2,Maybe a source for silly quotes,A chattering book: he/she told Bob Woodward that he/she/someone else told him/her/nobody at all at this/that meeting/not really but wanted to ... All in all it is just a collection of the public images people who are called major players want to give to a journalist who so addresses them.So if you want any insights into the US government's reactions after 9-11 and the war in Afghanistan this book is a waste of time. The only use for it I can foresee is as a source for silly quotes some future historians might use. Maybe.
3,An Ode to Bush,"A very favorable, indeed almost fawning, portrait of Bush and his war cabinet. Bush comes across as strong post 9/11 leader with the right instincts and a good crises management style. This despite the fact, as Woodward's final chapters, if read carefully make clear, that the ultimate success of the Afghanistan war at the end of 2001 was a complete and unexpected, although welcome, surprise to the Administration rather than the natural result of a well thought out and well executed strategy. This does raise a number of concerns about whether Bush will be as lucky in Iraq. Still, even with the recognition that Woodward's portrayal reflects the Bush Administration's spin rather than an objective appraisal, the book is well worth reading especially by those who still consider Bush an illegitimate president"
1,A chore to read,"Bush at War is, without a doubt, the most boring book I have ever read. Woodward manages to describe one of the most emotional times in our history with no emotion whatsoever.In fact, the only emotion in the book comes from Bush himself, who was interviewed by Woodward. However, everything that comes out of his mouth sounds like a potential campaign slogan and shouldn't be taken too seriously.Whether you are a Bush supporter or detractor, stay away from Bush at War. Unless, of course, you suffer from insomnia, then get it immediately."
3,"useful, but not engrossing","sticking mainly to a chronological reporting of events as opposed to thoughtful analysis this book is useful if you are interested in the details about what trnaspires behind the scenes when a president decides to go to war. it was reassuring to see bush is not a complete imbecile but his brand of texas macho ""get em dead or alive"" was a bit unerving. perhaps this book would have been better off having been written a few years down the line when the consequces of our war on terrorism can be more fully understood and placed in their proper context."
5,A real eye opener,"If you really want to know what is happening behind the scenes at the White House, you will thoroughly enjoy this book. Bob Woodward does an outstanding (and surprisingly unbiased) job. This account of recent history reveals what has been done since September 11 by our Security Council led by President Bush to fight the war on terrorism. The complexity of this type of war becomes clearer. Every citizen should read and share with others."
2,Okay to browse.,"A difficult book to stay with. Political issues and personal preferences aside, investigative reporting requires intimate knowledge and follow through interviews of ""leaks"" and obscure sources.Deep Throat led to the demise of the Nixon white house and the complicated relationship between Woodward and Bernstein. This book made me wonder who was the real investigator.Web news is more up to date and interesting.In my opinion."
5,Even puff-pieces can serve history,"Thank goodness for this book, as it eloquently corroborates Richard Clarke's assertions that prior to 9/11, al-qaeda was not on Bush's radar, let alone his priority list. Despite fervent daily briefings from CIA director Tenet, and a strong warning from the outgoing Clinton administration, Bush himself admits in this book that he ignored the danger signs. Woodward must be a far-sighted genius, cleverly lulling an unsuspecting Bush into admitting it.Okay, actually neither Woodward or Bush had any idea at the time the quotes in this book would come back to haunt the administration, but there you have it. I understand that future printings of this book will have a title modification: ""Bush (was a failure) At War."" Proof that even puff-pieces like this have their purpose to history."
3,Bush at war,"Bush at War is poorly written; however, it is very informative and gives great insights into the Bush administration's decision making. But definitely not wort shelling out the cash, wait for it to come out on mass-market."
4,Great Read,Excellent account of the reaction to the September 11 attacks from a presidential and strategic perspective. The lack of options and actual course of action was enlightening.
3,ANOTHER BOOK ON BUSH,"I suppose everyone else has read all they want about the Bush era, but I saw this on sale and was interested particularly because it was written by Bob W. I must say it wasn't his finest. Evidence of being written fast was ample. However, I did learn some things. The most interesting aspect was that Woodward was always neutral to positive about GB. Therefore, it had creditability. It was an easy read and enjoyable."
3,Good Book,"I wouldn't describe this as the best book I have ever read, however, it did give me a great deal of insight as to what occurred in the White House after 9/11. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the war in Afghanistan."
2,Bob Woodward sells his soul to the neo-cons,Wow. A right wing view of Bush's war efforts with blinders added. Woodward's aim at terrorism is as bad as Bush's. Bush does not deserve to be on any pedestal.
3,Propoganda at it's best,"I can't believe people are reading this as non fiction. This is fiction at its best. There are much better books out there to get a clearer picture of what's going on in Iraq. And if you're interested in the truth then I earnestly recommed anything by Noam Chomsky, as well as these two books, which will no doubt enlighten you about the Bush administration and the war in Iraq: (1) War Plan Iraq: Ten Reasons Against War with Iraq (Milan Rai); and (2) STUPID WHITE MEN (Michale Moore). And if you love a good laugh, here's a satire on Bush and the media: The little samba boy (Jay Singh). The truth is out there."
2,Bestselling rehash,"As a person who scarcely gets much national news, I was able during the aftermath of 9/11 to hear the national news reports on our response to that tragedy. Woodward, who has access to the most private conversations in Washington and even to the principals themselves, might have given us a book more revealing than this. From cover to cover it is little more than a compilation of tidbits reported in the media. Except for a few names, nicknames and details labels for things, and a few details of what so-and-so thought of so-and-so's inputs at meetings, the entire panorama is fairly well-known even to me, who as I said does not get enough national news. The style lacks pith and punch, whichs makes for quick, almost mindless reading."
2,Political reporting 'lite',This book makes clear that Bob Woodward has become the Barbara Walters of political journalism. Facile and lightweight. Frustrating lack of critical analysis. Devoid of penetrating questions. Puff piece for the administration.
3,An Inside But Unsuprising View of 2001/2002 News Events,"The book generally provides a good summary of White House meetings and actions following 9/11/2001. It focuses on the events leading up to the Afghanistan War and the events ending in its successful conclusion. I did learn a little more about the thinking of the principals involved, especially Secretaries Powell and Rumsfield. That said, there is nothing especially surprising in the information, especially for individuals who follow the news. It is worth reading, but not worth keeping. I passed it on to my Dad."
3,"accurate, but scary...","The most unsettling aspect of this book is that, even though it is not 'anti' (or even really 'pro') Bush, reading it certainly lowered my estimation of him. He leads the country like he is reading from a John Wayne script, and refuses to let things like reason or facts or analysis get in the way. His decisions are based on strong principles. Operating this way is good only when it is after a lot of analysis. George Bush simply does not put in the thought necessary for his office. He is an ideologue."
2,Woodwards Latest Effort,"In his latest book, BUSH AT WAR, Woodward displays his classic liberal bias towards Bush. Woodward casts him unfairly as a bit of a bumpkin. Also, there is his laughable characterization of Rumseld and Wolfowitz as reactionary and almost malevolent figures trying to influence Bush. Yet, somehow Woodward is able to treat superficially and without comment Clinton's contributions to the whole 9-11 mess and the aftermath. Finally, Woodward demonstrates remarkable ESP powers by describing what various people are actually thinking, even when their words suggest something different.I can't recommend this book as an objective or insightful anaysis of Bush at War."
4,Very Interesting,"This is 4 star writting by the great Woodward. But I think it was so important, as I read this book, not to forget that his conclusions were drawn from impressions he got from the principles; Mr. Woodward wasn't there. He told their story which I found interesting and an effective balance to those of Clark and Dean. All three should be read."
2,Not a very good book,Other than giving you some insider information about the White House this book does not have anything interesting to say.Woodward tries to make the President look smart.I do not recommend this book because it does not have anything to say and seems like he tries to make the President look more knowledgeable that he really is!
3,Bush at War,"When I first read that the Washington Post had donated [money]... to George H.W. Bush's presidential campaign, I began to wonder if a friend of mine had not been correct in his Watergate conclusions; My friend thought Deep Throat was none other than George Bush, who even away back then (the late 1970s) appeared to have a hunger for catapaulting from the CIA into the White House. Woodward seems to be up to his old tricks -- revealing information without naming the source, just as I have done with ""my friend."""
2,Woodward's books are thin & Open Borders May Kill Us ALL,A very thin book and Woodward is a middling writer. He fails to point out the huge threat we face and how Bush is failing to protect the borders. Clinton was far worse but Bush needs to protect the borders and stop illegal aliens.
1,Bush at War,"I was disappointed. I had hoped for an unbiased look at the workings of the Administration. What I got was an obvious, agenda driven, manipulated story, driven by the Author's own view of the world. I was hoping for much more. I was very saddened by the Epilog. The Author used this section to ""prove"" everything he had put forth in his story. To bad he wrote both.The Author's view of the world is so skewed that at every instant when something profound took place, where something really affected the fabric of national life, the Author not only brushed it aside as strictly happenstance, he turned it into something ugly."
2,Looking back at events ....,"This book is a detailed account of what was said by Bush and his inner circle. There is no real attempt to form an opinion or show happenings in any light other than that of Mr. Bush and his group. I'd give it a 4 or 5 for accuracy, but due to the lack of insight into what Mr. Bush's course of action would cause long-term, this has to go down. I wouldn't advise this book to anyone who actually wants to _understand_ the events of 9/11, Afghanistan, or now Iraq. To Bob: 4 for being a faithful tape recorder and zero for analysis. You get a 2, and I'm going to offload the book on the used market."
4,A Fly on the WaLL! I LOVE IT!!,"Bob Woodward is a great reporter. Though he may not be the world's biggest Bush fan, this book gives you the feeling that you are a fly on the wall in TOP SECRET government meetings. Some of the things reportedly said by Bush sound chilling. It is an interesting read and a must have for anybody interested in the inner workings of politics and the White House!"
4,AWESOME READ -- ESPECIALLY NOW,"I always thought Woodward was a liberal, but not after reading this book. I really enjoyed it. It begins with the events of 911 and carries the reader through the war on terror in Afghanistan. Very interesting and readable. I blew threw it in a couple of days and wished there were much more. This book will give you confidence in the President whether you're a fan or not. One of Woodward's best works. I would have rated this a 5, but it left me wanting more. I really want part 2."
2,Spare me,Spare me.... Woodward is trying the impossible.... To make Bush look smart.... Someone must have hired Woodward to make Bush look credible...Powell is the only one who has some common sense...
4,"Fair, Balanced, Insightful","Whether you fan or detractor of President Bush, this book arguably provides the most balanced perspective on the inner-workings of the Bush Whitehouse after 9/11. It is a compelling read by a well respected author."
4,Inside story at the White House?,"Where are they heading for? What's their goal? If you are looking for a textbook that tells you the decision-making system in the Bush Administration, you should read 'Bush at War.'Written by Bob Woodward, a well-known journalist and also the writer of 'the Commanders,'etc., it clearly describes how foreign policy was made in the White House after the 9/11th attacks, citing, for example,struggles between Donald Rumsfeld and other hawkish guys and dovish Powell over foeign policy and war plans. It's as if he had eavesdropped on the White House. After reading this, you might be able to predict where the Administration will move ahead and what ramifications they will bring about for your own country and also for the world in the future."
1,Does nothing to help.,"The ONLY thing which books like this one accomplish is make those Black and Latino women that are already paranoid even more so--not only does it NOT shed any new light on this whole DL phenomenon but it does nothing to help. The proliferation of books on this extremely controversial subject has not done much for anyone as most of them are as tabloidy and sensationalist as can be. J.L. King's bestseller ""On The Down Low"" is a far better and much more REALISTIC read."
3,"It's ORGASM, not ORGANISM!","This book was riddled with typos and grammatical errors. Was there no publisher? Anyway, I liked that the book was double-spaced so it was pretty easy to read. The majority of the book is really about the AIDS/HIV epidemic in the black community. It had articles and statistics and so forth. I just concentrated on the signs and the interview with the DL brotha.Most of the signs were dead on point, some of the signs I did disagree with though because they could have applied to any brotha, not just a down low brotha.I recommend this book if you have NO CLUE, but if you have some clue--you probably should bypass this book."
1,An epidemic?,"Marrying a gay man is an epidemic? Please. This book was a very poor excuse at trying to make sense of ""Down Low"" brothers.I think my biggest beef with the book was the chapter on HIV, and trying to make it sound as if it's due to the ""brothers on the down low"" who sleep with other men. HIV doesn't discriminate. It affects all sexualitys, all races and all genders. Her blaming HIV infection increases strictly on gay men is unfair. Any one can get HIV+, and I'm sorry, this book bordered on hate speech."
4,Ya gotta check it out!,"Emergency! will knock your head for a loop. The sound is raw and more akin to a distorted punk record than a pristine GRP-like digital recording. And the trio is equally raw. And although the sounds are raw and perhaps unrefined-- the songs can actually get pretty complex (especially McLaughlin's ""Spectrum""-- tricky head!).BOTTOM LINE-- check out Tony Williams Lifetime's Emergency! Yeah, there are some dodgy hippie vocals, but so what-- they meant it, and that was the time! Sonically and musically, Larry Young, Tony, and John are totally going for it and rocking!!"
4,Visionary Trio,"I hesitated to purchase this cd for years based on misleading comments about the sound quality. Finally relenting, I now own a copy and this remaster sounds great. The dirty sound has to do with the level of distortion chosen by John Mclaughlin and Larry Young on their respective instruments, and not with the sound engineering of the recording. Tony's drums sound excellent and are recorded with a good deal of dynamic range for 1969. The other reviews are right on concerning the musical content of this ground breaking release . It's a classic of the period."
2,overrated,"Personally I like the second Tony Williams Lifetime band better no disrespect to John Mclaughlin but Alan Holdsworth is just that more on edge and the songs seemed to have more purpose and direction. This recording as important as it may be in the birth/raising of fusion is very harsh and the grooves are too loose and heavier to the ear than metal (probably a bad comparison)but maybe that's the idear but I'm not as appreciative. Do not expect any Jimmy Smith, or Johnny 'Hammond' Smith comparisons to Larry Young on organ. Overall disappointing."
4,"Horrible sound, great music",Now this is supposed to have been a quite ground-breaking record. The music is really splendid but the sound quality is really horrible and does distract somewhat since a lot of older stuff is available where both production and transfers do the music more justice.
4,T-Bone,"Tony Williams can be described as the ingenius man of superiority that has been kind enough to record such albums of amazement. He is truly a pioneer of drumming becuase he was one on the first to start the jazz-rock evolution. ""Emergnecy"" is one of the jaw-dropping albums that is a necessity for any fan or collector. The recording has a rough touch to it, however, this brings out the raw essence of flavor. Another aspect of considerations is the fact that he is man of a four piece set. His speed, power, and exactness combine to make the drumming phenominal. At first, this album by be unappealing, but listen to it two-three times and really analyze everything about the ablumn and see how you like it."
1,Not at all effective. Completely the opposite.,"I wish there had been a review of this product before I decided to purchase it online. The first, and therefore main ingredient is alcohol, which is very drying to the hair. The product boasts in claiming to stimulate the production of Sebum, however the serum does more drying to the hair than creating any secreation through oils. Please do not invest in this highly expensive, yet very adverse and ineffective product."
1,"Nice smell, pointless product","It just doesn't work. I'd hoped it would, as I have very thinning hair. I'd come to terms with it, but a friend suggested that this treatment has an excellent reputation. Well, it did not work for me at all. It smells potent. Feels like it's doing something as it sometimes would sting a little, but it did nothing whatsoever and was a complete waste of money. Do not buy this product."
2,Not worth the money?,This product possibly helped make my hair a little stronger but I didn't see any new hair growth. I used as directed.
4,"Different band, different sound, good results","Having been a fan of Henry Rollins since the Black Flag days, I look forward to each new Rollins release with anticipation. I'll admit that although GET SOME, GO AGAIN is not my favorite Rollins Band album, (THE END OF SILENCE wins that award) I like what's been done to change the band's sound. The band is more rock orientated than previous line ups. Even though I enjoyed the jazz-like meanderings of Chris Hackett, Sim Cain, and Melvin Gibbs, I also like a band that can flat-out rock. This band can do that. I saw them live on Backstage at 54 about a month and plan on seeing them in NY when they come through. The band was tight, poweful, and seemed to inspire Rollins to really put it all into his own performance. Maybe this album will disappoint some Rollins fans, but I like the new direction."
5,Not half bad: all good,"even though the line-up is new, (except for rollins) it still sounds enough like the original rollins band to satisfy me. a little more punk than the previous recordings. being different is what keeps things interesting. if all rollins band records sounded the same, it would get stale. at least it's better than bone thugs n harmony, which is what the line was for at the store. i thought i would be lucky to buy the last copy of this. turns out, everyone was in line to buy the new bone thugs n harmony cd. the guy behind the counter was astounded that someone still listens to the rollins band. keeps things interesting."
4,Killer Hard Rock Album,"You can always count on some good rock and roll from Rollins. This one is a throwback to the earlier Rollins Band albums. More pure rock and roll instead of the slow-fast-slow-fast formula on the last 2 or 3 albums. If you just want to jam, this is for you. Be sure to check out Rollins when he tours this time. I saw them about six months ago when he was out to break in the new band, and they were incredible."
4,I'm a Monster,"Damn, that's a good song! The most rock-n-roll Rollins to date and that's fine by me. High energy music with a fired up Rollins behind the mike. Get it!"
3,rollins like usual,now this album is decent. but Weight & Come In and Burn kill this album. if you know rollins you would know why this cd is the way it is... but it fell far short of expectation... but i bought it having rollins being my idol....
4,The Next Step In The Evolution Of Rollins,"Hank Rollins has moved on to the next platuea in his music. Definatly more rock and faster paced than most of his previous albums, this one is meant to be played loud and flood you with testosterone and adrenaline. Hotter and hotter and Illumination are two of the tracks that I think stand out amongst the rest, but the whole album is top notch. The only thing I felt it lacked somewhat was that there could have been a couple more introspective, dark edged songs. But hey, that's just me. This is the evoulution of Rollins. He just keeps bruning hotter and hotter."
4,BIG help for weekend DIYers,"For those non-professionals with limited patience and weekend time who want to have their paint job on windows look great, this is a terrific product. I have 6-over-6 windows and fully divided French doors throughout my house. Cutting in to paint them is a horrendous task. But, with Glass Mask, in seconds, each window pane can be masked off and paint ready. No lining up blue tape and trimming each inside corner (that's 24 per window for me). Still want to not glob on paint as each is done...but slips of the wrist and attempts to get into every nook and cranny do not cause repeated frustration. After painting, clean up is simple. Just come back with a razor scraper when the paint is dry and quickly remove the glass mask. Vacuum up the leavings, and voila! Beautiful, professional-looking paint job. My only challenge is I currently cannot find this product locally, so I may have to buy online and pay shipping."
1,useless,"This is one of the myriad of contraptions aimed at making something that require skill and patience simple and easy. You might as well light your money on fire. Applying the masking liquid takes almost the same amount of time and skill that it would to cut in with a brush. Save your money. Buy a roll of bluet tape, there's no way to paint around glass without being patient and careful."
3,"great treadmill, computer needs work","I enjoyed my manual treadmill so much I bought one for my mom. This one worked when I first put it together, but after that the computer stopped working. The treadmill is still great, but it would be nice to know how far you've walked. I tried to find a manual or trouble shooting online but couldn't find one"
1,disappointed,"The treadmill is on an uphill angle. It is very easy to fall off. The screw head to the exercise computer broke off, and the remainder of the screw is stuck inside the screw hole. There is no phone number for the manufacturer on the treadmill or in the owners manual. Apparently it was on the box which we had already discarded before we realized we needed it. I would not recommend this product and would like to get rid of mine."
3,"OK, but difficult for an older beginner.","Hard for an older beginner to use as is. I blocked the back up so the belt was level and it was usable for me an older beginner, still very wobbly. At least I am getting some exercise with it."
5,Great lazy treadmill,This is not bad for the price. And is great for lazy people. It really makes you workout harder and using your own muscle. I can truly feel it on my legs.
5,Great buy!,"I decided recently due to the cold weather that I would try to find an inexpensive manual treadmill. I really didn't want to spend much over $100,so I knew my options were limited. I happen to come across this treadmill, read the reviews and decided to go ahead and order it. I'm glad I did, despite the several negative comments. First off, it arrived in less than a week. And it was surprisingly simple to assemble..plus no household tools needed. Assembled in about 15 minutes. Easily folded up and easily transportable from room to room if needed. NO issues with the belt at all,sturdy, and easy to walk on,OR jog! I think it's the PERFECT little treadmill and I highly recommend it!"
4,Perfect for my use,"The ""computer"" is beyond useless--not even in the ballpark of accuracy and shuts off at random--but I bought this little treadmill to walk off excess energy when the weather's too bad to go outside, so I don't care how long or how far I've walked, or how many calories I've burned. The treadmill arrived a day before schedule, all the pieces present, and I put it together easily in about 20 minutes with only some light supervision from the cat. I'm pleased with it; it's an inexpensive manual treadmill that doesn't take up a lot of space, which is exactly what I expected. For whatever it's worth to potential buyers, I'm 5'10"" with an average stride length and have no problems with walking off the end. I'm still knocking off a star for the ""computer"", though...it's laughable."
1,Unsatisfied,"This is very hard to set up and to store, track keeps slipping from side to side, you can not just walk, the frame is weak, and shaky very unhappy with this item. would not recommend this to anyone."
3,Trreadmill,"I really like the product, except that it doesn't have an option to lower it to normal walking level. That's the only down of this product."
5,GREAT CHOICE,"I bought this treadmill to replace an older one of 7 yrs. I wish we had known of this one back then. It's easy to set up and 100% easier to walk on. My husband loves it, so happy we got it, just enough incline to work the heart."
2,Waste of money,I bought this treadmill and returned it within 3 days. The sensor that controls the computer did not work. The treadmill's track is too short. I am 5 foot 7 and was unable to take a full stride on this thing. I would suggest buying something else or walking around the block instead of using this.
3,Manuel treadmill,"Manuel treadmills not the best - was a good price but the angles to adjust not work well at all, we sold this one and got a new electric one, that is MUCH better ! Keep the POWER coming !"
2,Get What You Pay For :(,This product is not well made. The runner is thin and it doesn't look like it will hold up after use. We returned it the day after we purchased it. I was amazed at how fast we recevied the refund. I gave it two stars for the refund only.
1,doesnt work well,I got this it was easy to set up but almost not able to be3 used ther is no flow my girlfriend calls it a accident waiting to happen.
2,Treadmill,"It did not arrive on time, and I attempted to contact them 3 times regarding a question I had regarding the product with no response. It took them almost a week to get back to me."
3,It's ok for the price.,"This treadmill is good for walking. It's a real work out 20 min. straight and I'm sweating a lot! A little noisy and some lack of consistency with the belt but I think it's ok for the price, you can't expect perfection. I love that it's easy to set it up and very light to move it around your place. It's ok."
4,manual treadmill,"this treadmill is very easy to assemble, 2 person recommended to build, easy to use, no problems with it."
3,Good value if you just plan to use for walking,"My first manual treadmill, and a decent product. Does take some time to get use to. Don't buy this if you expect to use this for running. Given that the treadmill needs to be at a small incline so your motion pushes the belt down and around, runnning is extremely difficult. Works well if you plan to use for fast walking in your home."
1,Unfortunate,I purchased this product after a decent amount of research - and evidently didn't do enough. I've owned manual treadmills before - a lot cheaper - and much better quality. THE BELT STICKS - THERE IS BARELY ANY FRICTION - which makes it very difficult to achieve any consistent exercise routine. DON'T BOTHER WASTING YOUR MONEY !!!
3,Might have been better off going to a second hand store to buy a better treadmill...,"When assembling the computer bracket, the screw broke in two, rendering the computer unusable and leaving a dangling cord. The treadmill itself is as difficult to use as previous reviews have said, but once you get the swing of it, it at least does the trick. However, the instructions recommend maintaining the mat by spraying WD-40 under it for less friction. I'm a little worried about doing that, because the friction at least helps me to not fall off. I do wish I could walk on it without having to keep myself pulled up by the holding onto the handle bars the whole time, though. And jogging or running? Forget about it... Not a safe idea to do on this."
1,phoenix manual treadmill,"Crap!Mat doesn't roll smoothly, its starts... rolls for 2-3 seconds then stops hard. I greased it, adjusted it, greased it again and had minimal improvement. Yes it's quiet and its sturdy but the roller mat doesn't slide over the slick board. I returned mine."
1,Phoenix 98516 Easy UP Review,"The Phoenix 98516 Easy UP Manual treadmill is a menace. It is difficult to use and control the speed. The treadmill is built so cheaply that the belt slides around, causing bursts of speed. It is rickety and you cannot adjust the incline up or down. It's garbage, I am going to donate it to charity."
3,Review on Phoenix 98516,I like the size and the fold up position of the tredmill to save space when not in use. It needs an ajustment on the pressure on the belt that you walk on.
3,"Good manual treadmill, but it's still a manual treadmill...","If you're going to get a manual treadmill for walking, and you've used a manual treadmill before, then this is the one to get. Sturdy, easy to assemble, easy to store. However, it is still a manual treadmill, which means it has limitation. Also I found it too narrow to run on."
5,Phoenix 98515 manuela treadmill,"This was easy to assemble, with all the necessary tools in tact and it's not too heavy and rolls away like a charm....I think I am going to enjoy walking' on this. It is too hot right now to walk outdoors, so this should do the trick..."
3,Manual Treadmill,"Phoenix 98516 Easy-Up Manual TreadmillThis is a good product for the money. You will get a good workout, having to use your own power to make it run. I love how it folds up for easy storage....a real space-saver!!"
2,Doesn't Work Like I Thought,"For anyone thinking a small manual treadmill might be the way to go, you may want to think again. I got this thinking its small size would be an asset, as I could store it anywhere I chose. But I soon found out that manual treadmills are a hell of a lot of work, they are much harder to use than a motor driven treadmill is.As others have stated this thing has no height adjustment on the rear, so in my experience the angle this treadmill sits at means I end up going a lot faster than I would like, and the tension adjustment seems to do next to nothing in terms of changing the speed. I ended up having to build a small wood platform on the back so I could adjust the level of the treadmill as needed.Also after only one use 3 screws holding the bottom part together were already stripped out and I had to re-secure them with wood glue, so its not exactly the best built treadmill you will ever find either."
4,awesome!,"bought this machine and was a little hesitant but once i started using it is great i love it....its sturdy and best of all since it has no motor my legs get a real good workout...its good for walking as well as running, would totally recommend it,great product!"
1,Fragile and didn't last 24 hours,"I hate to be so down on a product, but this treadmill broke the first time we used it.For the price, you'd be better off buying a stationary bike from a used sporting goods store. My husband picked this out, thinking he'd like it more than the electric treadmill (he doesn't like the noise, I wear headphones when I use it). But it was wobbly, he thought the wobbliness would disappear once he was walking, but instead it broke.Major disappointment."
4,Satisfied,"The treadmill arrived within 3 days of order, and was put together in less than an hour. It is very easy to move the belt walk on and is sturdy (I'm 5'2"")- my husband, who is 6'1"" says the tread is too short for him. I wanted this model to keep outside (under cover) for rainy and snowy days, and am satisfied for the price."
3,Easy set up but the incline is too high and can't be adjusted.,"I sit A LOT at my job and decided that I would get this treadmill so that I could move more during the day during my breaks. I have a herniated disk and sitting all day just makes it worse.First, The treadmill came to me at record pace. I ordered it Friday and it arrived that Monday with standard shipping! Very easy to put together. I had the assistance of my 12 year old daughter and we were able to finish it in 15 minutes. However, this is where my 3 star rating comes in...when you put it together you only have one option for the incline and it's pretty steep. I've tightened the belt as much as it will go and it is still very difficult to walk normal on. Now, granted I am completely out of shape and have back issues so a flatter level option would have been better for me. Someone w/o back issues may not have as difficult a time as I do. That said, I will give it a try and maybe it will become easier for me."
4,Reviews from previous buyers sold this to me!,"I think the price, the simplicity, light weight, and the reviews of your previous purchasers sold me! It arrived just fine, and as suggested in the set up, I had my son put it together for me. I am 68 and felt I couldn't hold the bars in place to get the actual treadmill in properly. The belt does tend to travel more than I would like, but the little wrench is easy to use and get it re-aligned. For the price, it is more than satisfactory. I did find two things: as one of your reviewers stated she put two paperback books under the back as it was a little steep for her, and I have found that if the treadmill was about 1 foot longer, it would actually be a better walk. Other than that - very satisfied!"
1,Waste of money,"Even tightening the belt the fullest, it was too lose to use. Don't buy if you're over 6' tall. Arrived with a broken computer circuit board. Piece of junk."
1,Delivered Friday. In trash bin Sunday.,"This thing was so infuriating, I trashed it within 48 hours of receiving it. It had a mind of its own. The belt kept going to the right no matter what I did. I followed the directions diligently. I loosened the belt, centered it, and it immediately went right despite my doing the adjustments given in the manual.I did get about 3 minutes of exercise before the belt folded over and I could do nothing with it. I was so infuriated, I just wanted to get rid of it, and I did. I had a Denise Austin one before and had no trouble with it for over a year. Bit this contraption had a mind of its own.According to the other reviewers, I guess I just got a lemon."
5,Solid and easy to assemble,Although compact enough to fit in the corner of my living room it is very solid and not tippy at all. It assembled easily with no after assembly adjustments for this senior citizen.The exercise computer isn't worth muuch and I just set the timer on my microwave for how long I want to walk.This is great way to get some exercise and avoid going out into the weather.
4,"Good treadmill, good price","The Phoenix treadmill was a great price, a few dollars less that other similar ones I had researched, and this one held a higher weight capacity. It works better than I had anticipated. When you are walking on it, the belt moves very smoothly. Set-up was relatively easy. The only down side is that the wire the connects the treadmill to the monitor was missing the connector piece, so the monitor does not work."
4,good workout for the money,"i received this item 3 days before it was scheduled. i was able to have it assembled and ready to use in about 10 minutes. i believe i am in decent shape, and i began feeling the workout in about 15 minutes. i didn't notice the belt slipping and it folds up very nicely, with a smal footprint when not in use. i should mention that i am kind of a short guy, about 5'7"", so my stride is short, which made jogging fairly easy. anyone with a longer stride would probably have a hard time running on this, as the belt area is fairly short. all in all i am very happy with this purchase."
4,Synthesized and Mesmerized,"Tensongs by the group Hubert Kah is somewhat a cross between German synth-group Yello of the 80's and Alphaville. Kah's music has a cold yet dramatically likeable sound with rich synthesized textures. Lead singer Hubert Kemmler's voice is what adds the warmth and likeability factor to this material; Otherwise, the music would just be another gimmicky soundtrack of the 80's. For import fans of Hubert Kah the two most highly recommended c.d.s by the group would be Sound of My Heart ( a lot more enjoyable and up to date--even though released in 1989) and Hubert Kah's self-titled album ( not a pop/dance album but highly recommended for the excellent vocals and ballads-released in 1996)."
1,"great era for the band, just bad recordings!","In no way does this review apply to the seller, but to the company who put this junk out. It was a great era for Humble Pie but the recordings are choppy and one doesn't even start at the beginning of the song, which is pretty horrid. Don't hurt this legendary band by releasing junk, PLEASE!"
3,"NOT in color, and NOT original music","Good value for the price, but it's advertised as ""in color"" when really it's in black and white. Bit disappointing. Please try again; I loved this old sappy show."
5,memory lane,"I purchased this video here on Amazon and already had these two episodes in my ""classic tv collection"", but having them with the commercials from when I was growing up truly brings back a whole lot of memories. Yes, you can get these two episodes else-where without commercials, but that is part of the word ""CLASSIC"", the commercials add that special something. And the price was great. So ""Ride the little train that is rollin' down the track to the Junction......"" you know the rest."
5,petticoat junction was always on Saturday at my house I didn't miss it ever,I loved to watched petticoat junction every Saturday night I liked all the plots they had and to see them again is a great entertaining feeling you would want to have if you watch it on tape or disc you can see what shows used to be like in those days and comedy used to be clean and simple
1,Petticoat Junction DVD an unfortunate mistake,"The best part of this nostalgic visit to the 1960's is the catchy theme song. Not only is the original theme missing from this DVD, but the awkward replacement music overdubs the beginning dialogue in each episode. I watched two episodes in hopes that the first was an unfortunate pilot, but I now realize that I have been ripped off, and we plan to insist on a refund."
1,The pits,"As a big-time fan of Petticoat Junction, I was tremendously disappointed in this DVD. The picture quality is the absolute worst. This is a major rip-off and the company that released it should refund everyone's money. Who's idea was it to over-dub the theme song? Give me a break! I will certainly make a note of the releasing agent of this disc and NOT PURCHASE anything else with their name on it!! Shame on you! Junk, junk, junk!!I want to see the entire series transferred with SUPERIOR quality and sound, with no rediculous over-dubbing or edits. Whoever owns the rights to the show needs to sell permission to a QUALIFIED DVD entertainment group. I think Mr. Haney had something to do with this fiasco.Since I wrote this review, better DVD's have been released; MPI and Paramount. Both contain the original music and much, much better video. Unfortunately, nothing past the second season got released. Buy the newer versions and leave this one alone."
1,Collectors dream gone bad...,"Everyone should buy this dvd......NOT!!!!!!!! This is one of my all time favorite shows and they really made a mess of it. The quality was bad and the theme song...WAS GONE!!!!!Simply this, don't waste your money. If you never saw ""Petticoat Junction"", you're in for a treat, but don't watch it this way. Wait for a qulified company to put it out. Doesn't even deserve one star."
5,A must for all Petticoat Junction fans!,Episodes shown on this DVD are:Bobby Jo and beatnikLast chancePlease buy violetsKate's recipe
1,Maybe Whiy The Theme Song's Been Excised,"I was not a fan of this show and wasn't looking to buy this disk (and don't own it and haven't seen it), but stumbled on this page and started reading the reviews, because I always like to read bad reviews.The reason the theme song was replaced might be this: the company that put out these DVD's is obviously a hack outfit. The program themselves may be public domain, but the theme song may not be. Hence, they can release the video, which is no longer copywrited (may have lapsed for whatever reason), but they cannot release a recording of the theme song, which is probably still under copywrite.Thus, they dubbed over the theme song and relesed a cheap-o version of the video.You fans of this show will just have to wait for a decent release."
1,Not one original idea or thought,"All these glowing reviews aside, this is a pretty bad CD. After my first listen I thought it was pretty cool. Repeated listenings reveal an artist attempting to make an 'artistic statment' that falls short of anything memorable. 'Back In 1999' is the only keeper here. The less said about the 2 attempts at social commentary the better--'I Might Look White' is an embarrassment and the cliche-ridden 'Bisexual Chick' would have sounded dated in 1980 (what, no reference to Birkenstocks?).About the most original thing here is the title of the CD. And a quick search on Amazon reveals at least two other recent CDs with the same title by other artists. There's nothing here that hasn't been done better by others. This guy is a poser.When I took this CD to my local used CD store to sell it, they wouldn't even take it. It seems Oszajca's label had flooded the market with promo copies. Not a good sign. Pass on this one.It is now 2004. Where is this 'great new artist' these days?"
4,Where is Bob when ya need him??,"I had heard ""bisexual chick"" on a promotional video before watching American Psycho this spring, and I really thought it was funny. So, upon returning home and getting my old job back at the record store, I picked up FROM THERE TO HERE. I was pleasantly suprised. My best friend and scanned through the tracks and loved track #2 (Where's Bob Dylan When You Need Him). He rushed out the next day and purchased it as well. A good sound investment for someone interested in entertaining creative music."
5,FUN STUFF!,As an elementary teacher I'm always on the hunt for exceptional books for our reading times...on a tip from another teacher I found Brewster the Rain Makin' Rooster...my kids loved the writing and the beautiful illustrations...I highly recommend this book!
5,works great,"Bought this after putting a screen door on our deck. The corner of screen was catching our awning, so I remembered,that I had one on our RV, to keep door from rubbing that awning. So got this one and solved problem. Took two minutes to install. handy product."
4,My new Jordana seems to be the way to go.,"Used the Windows Media Manager for PC, to upload MP3 files form my desktop to the Jordana without a problem. However I am already looking for an expansion flash card. You won't be doing much music listening with the 16MB that come with the unit.The color screen is bright and the back light does a fairly good job under normal conditions.On the downside, you do notice the difference in weight when compared to my Palm Pilot Pro, and it feels bulkier. I also wish that the flip up lid would fold all the way back.Overall, I had a difficult time making up my mind on buying the new Palm color or the Jordana, however given my needs Windows OS seemed the better choice."
2,It crashs,"Got it as agift from MS, It crashed 3 times in one hour. Just saw CNET review.(they said it crashed 4 times in 3 hour) Please remember it's from MS. Some improvments, not enough. If you are a MS fan, it's a better buy than CE. I will not buy it myself."
1,The late fine print...,"Before anyone plunks down the $$$ for this unit ...Inshort, despite the fact that the Jornada 540 series is advertised todisplay 16-bit colors, in practice, the actual display quality is 12-bit. A pretty major difference.From what I understand, the Casio E-115 is the only true 16-bit display PocketPC unit.This bit of product revisionism aside, the 545 is a fine piece of gadgetry. Too bad I didn't know about the display quality until too late...."
3,Great product but . . .,"I bought a Jornada 545 last week. The product itself is great. The screen is bright and clear, and the ebook reader is really nice. I've downloaded several games and they work well and look great. Some of the navigation in PocketWindows is clumsy, but I'm used to it now.My only complaint is with HP support . . ."
3,"Not perfect, but so little is--See it anyway","Alexander Mackendrick has one of the oddest film careers imaginable, lurching from brilliant satire (THE MAN IN THE WHITE SUIT), to smashing melodrama (SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS) to off-beat swashbuckler (A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA), and finally to this eccentric romantic comedy about a hustling drifter (Tony Curtis) adrift amidst various California oddballs. It never quite works, but there is so much offbeat charm, particularly in Sharon Tate's deadpan takeoff of a California beach bunny, that you finally don't care if it doesn't work. And Curtis is in there working, by the way, giving yet another of his deft, underrated comic performances. But so few people appreciated comedy--until it's too late . . ."
3,Colorful Send up of California Lifestyles,"Probably one of Tony Curtis's most enjoyable 60s vehicles,he's a wanderer who gets caught up in the sunsoaked lives of an Italian bombshell, a pool exec,a body builder and his sky diving girlfriend. Claudia Cardinale at her most radiant, Sharon Tate in one of her most mysterious performances.Good fun in the CA sun!"
5,Neat stuff!!,"I must admit I won't be building a coffee can antenna, but it sure is cool to know how to build one. I've learned quite a bit about my home WiFi network in an entertaining way. This is fun stuff."
1,Not that good....,"Bought the book with higher expectations; it only does an introductory job into the field of WiFi, containing and gathering info you can readily find over the net, and does it half way. Would only recommend it to someone with no particular knowledge in the field, who knows what Wifi is, but has no clue after that. Could make a nice gift for a 12 yr old tecky"
1,Did not fit.........,"The item was advertised as one size fits all, but they were WAY too small when i received them. I am an average size women (10-12) but there was no way they were going to fit :("
1,No song preview samples,"I am disappointed. There are no samples of the songs for this CD. A few titles are listed but no play time. I enjoy being able to preview CD's before purchasing. This is my first time logging on to this site. However, I was informed I could preview songs prior to purchase. I would like to purchase this CD, but not without a preview."
5,Great all around,"This is a great buy. If you are looking for one bokken, get this. Ebogu got it right when they decided to produce this. It has great balance and sounds great (with proper cuts). I will say that the color isnt white like the white oak. It is a light brown. Nonetheless, the overall quality makes this point negligble at best."
4,Get the original book with this NEW BINDED COVER,"We've bought two of the originally binded red cover editions from the 80s and both books have lost their covers within weeks of use. It must have been a publishing flaw or maybe the original glue is falling apart after 30 years but we can't get the original books to keep their covers, and then the pages start tearing off. I am trying the new edition with the Zoe and Elmo cover and hoping it holds together better."
4,bit dated and poor cover choice,"Wonderful book overall. My son 2y5m loves it, and the book is built quite sturdily as well.Negative points come from what others have already mentioned:1. elmo and zoe appear on the cover, and nowhere else inside the book, making for daily conversations about where elmo is, etc.2. it is a bit dated (i think orig published 1980) , which means that a lot of things (like cars, airplanes, TVs), look a lot different now, and how some everyday things are not included in the book (like computers).all in all, very good."
5,Excellent for a pre-schooler,"I bought this book as a present for my daughter's fourth birthday a month ago. Just about every night since then, we've read 6-8 pages of the dictionary to her at bed time. If it were up to her, we'd read more and more every night. She loves it."
1,The Ship That Sailed into the Living Room,"Never received. After notifying Amazon, was immediately credited for it by International Books. As for I.B., I'd never buy from them again, because, until I notified Amazon they sent 3 emails - all of them lies! Boooo. Yea, Amazon!I hate to review service with a star rating, but having never received the book, and not being able to post this post without a star rating, I had to give it something - so bare in mind that the 1 star is for International Books, not the title, I am ostensibly rating!"
4,Beautiful descriptions!,This is a true story about a young bride and her one-year round-the-world tour with her professor husband. Her beautiful descriptions of the places they visit make you feel like you get a glimpse back in time. Very well-written.
1,Awful,"Complete waste! -- I have a problem with crickets (huge crickets) coming in from the woods behind our building, I installed this ""repellant"" and I have to say... The crickets are practically hosting parties right in front of the device!!! Enjoying themselves so much in fact, they have decided to invite guests... a mouse!! Time to call the exterminator (again!)"
5,"A great, solid read!","Roberts kept me on the edge of my seat, from the first page to the last. When's the next one coming out?"
1,Terrible!,"This book leaves much to be desired. Although most code samples work in this book, almost all of them needed code syntax fixes. It is very apparent that this book was originally written with VB.NET in mind. There are entire sections that are not applicable to C#. Semi-colons are missing frequently. Unbalanced curly braces appear in the code. In chapter 3, the code didn't translate well when the authors copied and pasted it in. All of the quotation marks show up as question marks. (Sounds like MS Word's smart quotes...) Lastly, some screenshots mislead the reader. One example will not work unless you vary from the screenshot.From what I can tell, MS was so bent on getting an ASP.NET programming book like this out that they spent very little fixing small errors like these. Get a WROX or O'Reilly book instead."
2,Ok I guess it should be challenging to FIX his errors!,"ok......I am newbie, but I have both ASP and Java experience. The only reason I gave it two stars is because it atleast glances all the functions of ASP.NET (with mild examples). But now I am trying to do some of the exercises from chapter-3, and my results did not match his results in the book at all! I thought I did it wrong, but after a looking at the codes for a bit.....HE got the whole damm thing upside down. And in the book it says, do this and do that....but what the hell am I supposed to do when EVERYTHING is already typed in (full of errors). He says....type this code...I was gonna go type, but it was already written! I didnt spend all this money to look at his damm codes, I wanna write and learn. This book and the materials needs a lot of debugging!Buy the book if someones sells it for 3 bucks and free shipping!Shaf"
3,Primer for the UMC Book of Discipline,"This book was helpful while trudging through the UMC Book of Discipline 2000. (The 2004 is now available.) It helped to spot problems, provided some history, and pointed to possible future difficulties. If you must read and understand the UMC Book of Discipline, this book can be a simple way to start.Its usefulness is limited to UMC clergy and lay leaders. If you need to learn your way around the heirarchy and the bureaucracy, this is a place to start. Another book to consider is ""The Organization of the United Methodist Church"" by Jack Tuell."
5,Great companion to the UMC Discipline,"Extremely useful resource for pastors, seminarians. Also for lay leaders mystified by the church's polity and practices."
4,"Clear, Concise, and Compelling","I purchased this book for a United Methodist Polity class (church law basically). I was truly surprised and pleased that I actually enjoyed reading it. Frank strikes a good balance between explaining the structure of the church, explaining the United Methodist Discipline clearly, and relating it to real life examples. He also clearly loves the church and supports it, although he is clear eyed when describing its inner workings. I would recommend this or subsequent editions published as United Methodist polity continues to evolve."
1,"No ""Life Without You""","I quote the ad copy...""DVD Features:Songs Include: Before You Accuse Me (Eric Clapton), When The Night Comes (Joe Cocker), Leaving Las Vegas (Sheryl Crow), Pride And Joy/Life Without You (Stevie Ray Vaughan)""""Life Without You"" which is all I wanted, is not on the disk I received."
5,GREATEST GREATEST MOMENT DVD IN THE CENTURY!!!!,I TRULY LOVED THIS FLIM I CANT WAIT TO SEE ANOTHER THIS WAS FUNNY YET SAD AT TIMES MTV KEEP IT COMING!!!!
1,Not As Advertised,"If you thought that you would be getting a music video like you would be seeing on MTV, think again. This is a cheap taping of the artist playing in a studio."
5,Great for sauces and gravy,Arrived well packed (lots of padding and sturdy box) and on time. LOVE it with my other Denby Chili Fire tableware pieces!
1,Not as advertised -Turkey Lacers,"These turkey lacers are not being sent out as they are advertised. They say in their description, ""By the way, keep the lacers in their storage tube: loose lacers in a kitchen drawer, like socks in a dryer, tend to mysteriously vanish. They are sent on a flimsy piece of cardboard with a plastic covering and no storage tube in sight. Thank heavens amazon gave me a refund on these.They are also advertised as 4.5 inches. They are just about 4 inches long, counting everything, even the loops. They are smooth, so it is possible they can slip out of where you want them to hold. I just wish they were as sturdy as the trussing needle I have, there is no hope they can keep any pressure for an opening that needs to be closed."
3,"not as heavy duty as expected, no storage tube","The product description mentioned that these came with a storage tube, but that seems to have gone by the wayside. It's not a biggie, just an inconvenience, considering how infrequently I use turkey lacers, and how far they can travel in a drawer if they're not contained. They're okay, but I'm happier with the silicone lacer with attached needle that I also bought. That would be overkill for the neck, however, and these do the trick."
4,Reminiscent of Steinbeck,"O'Flaherty has brought alive a tragic era in Ireland's history similar to Steinbeck's handling of the Great Depression. He does this with more matter-of-factness but less poetic flair than Steinbeck. His ability to create vivid mental images, even in the Irish naive mind, is unprecedented."
5,Hunger for more,"For someone like myself, who actually lost family members as a result of the ""Great Famine,"" I was awe-struck by how the author so dramatically portrays the insensitivity and cruelty exhibited by the English during Ireland's greatest moment of need."
4,Famine,I could not find this book last year as it was out of print. I read it first from the one copy at my public library.... The famine came alive to me and the great suffering and humiliation people went through. I was surprised I had not heard of this book sooner. I highly recommend it.
3,A Subpar Whitewolf Effort,"Fans of the previous WhiteWolf rulebooks (Mage, Vampire, Wraith, Changeling, Werewolf) will most likely be disappointed by this fairly new release.I personally reserved a copy of Hunter:The Reckoning about 4 months before it hit the shelves and was saddened when I first read through it. The storyline for even the existence of Hunters is weak, the skills are mediocre at best when compared to the other systems and even the artwork was rather depressing.I leave my rating up at 3 stars only because it is at least new and tries to incorporate several of the other systems which often have little or no ties to each other despite failed attempts at 'crossover' books. I would recommend this book only to hardcore fans of Whitewolf who wish to own all of the rulebooks for their collection. It makes me sad that Wraith was phased out to make room for this monstrosity of a rule set.-Zilean"
3,Sum it up in one word...,"Disappointing... If your not planning on running a mortals campaign, don't bother with this book. If you are, then use this book alone. It will be very difficult to integrate into the other WOD books. You could run a Poltergeist: The Legacy type of campaign this this book. That's the only interesting thing I thought about this book."
1,Just Plain Bad....,Ewwww... I can't believe I am saying this there is now a WOD game that is worse than Werewolf. Hunter just screams bring in the Combat Drones..... (At least Werewolf had the saving grace of having an interesting backstory.)What in the heck was White Wolf thinking? The whole book is practically begging for some fundamentalist group to tear into it and start screaming about the evils of roleplaying.... White Wolf really crossed the lines of bad taste with this one....
2,Hunting for a good Hunter game,"Well, I met only disappointment in my purchase of this book, despite high expectations. I have come to expect only the best from White Wolf, and this product is definietly below par for them. It seems almost that they lost their touch on this one. It lacks the edge of previous releases such as Vampire and Werewolf. However, the best products to compare it too would be the other individual Hunter titles like The Inquisition, Project Twilight, etc. Granted, they set out to have a common man Hunter title, but it comes off contrived and weak in comparison to the aforementioned titles.I would refer the discerning gamer to the other Hunter titles for a good game of hunting down the monsters of the WoD, and to pass on this one."
4,A must for Serkin fans,"This is the Chopin you might expect from a great Beethoven pianist - severe, analytical and intense. No swooning or lingering here, just Chopin as pure (German?) music. Fascinating, but not a first recommendation."
4,Questions and Answers on The Science of Mind,"A pretty good read. Some of the ideas and opinions expressed are surprisingly modern considering how long ago the book was originally written. It did take me a while to realize that the term 'treatment' could be replaced with 'affirmation', which I could more easily relate to."
4,"Nice, oily but not greasy.","I like this. It made my dry elbows super soft and even worked on my boyfriend. It doesn't have a harsh smell which I like and it soaks in relatively fast. Don't let the ""Associated with pregnancy"" theme turn you off of this product- it's great for anyone."
5,Soothing!,"Very soothing product for the pregnant itching tummy! works wonderful for pregnancy massages too. For those of you who do not like the sensation of cream in your skin, this is great because it gets absorbed quickly and you can use it after showering and dress quickly afterwards."
2,didn't soak in well,I'm pregnant and applied this after a shower. It still hadn't absorbed by the time I had to get dressed half hour later and I wiped it off the best I could. I haven't tried it again since that initial time as regular lotion seems to be working fine for now.
1,waste of money,"A poorly written and poorly designed catalog of patterns. Hard to read, with a bibliograph/index that takes up approx 1/3 of the book. Save your money"
2,I really don't like it,"This blender was to replace a 25 or 30 year old Oster galaxy model - it was the best blender ever. Since I have owned a Kitchenaid mixer for about 18 years with no problems, I thought I'd give this a whirl (pun intended). It's absolutely worthless, it won't even puree soup, let alone crush ice. Other reviewers have mentioned how the jar fits straight down on the base. I just wasn't comfortable with that and thought it was only a matter of time before I absentmindedly attempted to unscrew it and caused a giant mess. It's now sitting in my pantry awaiting a garage sale. I bought another Oster, the Professional series with the simple toggle on/off switch. While not totally amazing like the old one, it's much, much better than this Kitchedaid. And less expensive, too."
2,Short Term Power,"We received this blender as a wedding gift a number of years ago. Thankfully, we've only used it occassionally for a smoothie or two. It works great, for about 2-3 minutes before it shuts itself off to prevent overheating. Once it's started overheating, forget about getting anything productive out of it. It will only work in short spurts and not at full power. We've realized this blender has seen it's last day when I had issues blending vegetables for a salsa (roasted tomatillos challenging a blender???). We're off to get an Oyster or a Waring... Sorry KA"
2,Similiar problem to the other reviewers,"The rubbler coupler was worn-out and the blender does not work anymore. It was heavy, but ran quietly and powerfull. The blender was easy to clean, just wipe the base and disassemble the holder."
3,Works great until something breaks,"We were very happy with the blender ... until it needed replacement parts. 1st time -- kids broke the blender jar. We knew it would not be cheap to replace, but because the style had changed slightly, we were forced to buy the blade mechanism that fits onto the jar and a new lid -- about half the price of a blender. 2nd time -- this is much worse -- while grating cheese, I hastily put the blender onto its base and started it up. Because the blender jar was not on right, the little nubby rubber things were shaved off of the blender base. My appliance repair store told me it happens all of the time and they could fix it for less than $20 -- but that was BEFORE Kitchen Aid took the part off of the market -- seems they just want to sell new blenders now. We're very disappointed in Kitchen Aid's customer service -- we have a perfectly good blender base and jar assembly, but can't get the small replacement part."
2,This blender is not very good,"How this blender got an editor's choice award is beyond me. I have had this blender since I got married 7 years ago. It has never crushed ice completely. Doesn't matter how much liquid you put in the container - it just doesn't do the job. Always end up with chunks of ice. Takes an eternity to smoothly puree anything. The lid has a detachable foam piece which falls out when you clean it, and it gets discolored and unable to be fully cleaned. The motor seems pretty wimpy too. It's ok for soups and other soft foods, but if you want something that crushes ice, this is not the one. Get an Osterizer. Same price, but way better motor, chopping blades, and construction. What used to take me 10 minutes now takes 10 seconds. No joke."
1,Disappointed,I should have read the 10/6 review before I bought this on 10/9. The only reason I am replacing my cheap osterizer and mini food process is because of the noise. My husband was complaining whenever I used either one of them . So I bought this KichenAid Blender and the little KitchAid Food chopper. Both of them are not performing as expected. I am returning both of them and digging out my cheap Osterizer and the mini Cuisinart. Noise or not I am sticking with the old ones.
1,money pit,"My wife bought one of these blenders because of the name and high fashion for the couter top. We used it on a fairly consistant basis for a couple of months and then moved and had it in storage for a couple of years( 2 years + or - a few days). We were excited to once again bring it back out of its box and rev it up to make some drinks. After using it less then 10 times the blade froze up and I thought ""No big deal"" I'll just order a replacement one right. I was told that they didn't make one nor did they have any that would fit. ... Save yourself the headache and stress!!! Go buy something your not going to cry over if it breaks. Your time and money are not worth thowing away on expensive cheaply made products."
2,Had it for years but used it under 15 times... then broke,"I'm very disappointed with this KitchenAid blender. The gasket crumbled like a cookie. I used it to blend fruit so it has not been abused. I had have it for about 10 years, however. It actually never blended well. I always ended up with chunks of fruits. I just ordered the part I needed but I might just give it away to someone in need. I think I will get a Ninja or similar. The Ninja has pretty good reviews. I'm pretty sure I will think twice before getting a KitchenAid item again."
2,Part Fail,"This is an overall nice blender, but the rotor is made of a low grade rubber and slowly disentgrates with each use until there are no teeth left to spin the blades. I called Kitchenaid about it and was given some nonesense about 'planned wearing' to protect other components. In other words the failing rotor is a intended design aspect. I've had it just over 2 years, and now to replace the rotor is a 25 dollar service charge."
2,"Quality construction, but doesn't get the job done","This blender is well constructed, powerful, quiet, easy to clean, safe, and attractive. The wide opening at the bottom makes it easy to remove thicker foods.Unfortunately, I never use it. The shape of the food container is such that the food is not efficiently funneled towards the blades. The result is uneven blending, with food chunks of all sizes in the mix. The longer you blend, the smaller the variously-sized chunks get, but the results are never completely smooth and even.I get much better use from a battery-powered blender that I paid less than 20 bucks for. Its motor can't compare, and it's a pain to use, but it produces consistently even blends."
2,If you never will blend hard items...,"Hard as in nuts, cinnamon, frozen fruits and ice then I suppose it's a blender to consider. The design of the coupler is weak, it seems to be a compromise for a blender that doesn't lock while blending. The motor is great and a glass pitcher is always more desirable, and the blade is well designed and manufactured. However, I'm not sure if these things will tip the scale against other makers."
3,This model is Discontinued,"I had this blender for over 10 years. It started to leak around the jar's base a few years ago. I tried to order a new gasket online but was unable to because the model was discontinued. I was very disappointed because the motor is still good and so is the jar and lid. Kitchenaid should still manufacture these gaskets, the blender is now useless and I was forced to buy a new kitchenaid blender which cost $100. The new blender is all in one so I can't put the jar (which is plastic) in the dishwasher like I could with the old glass one. The new one is not as easy to clean. The motor on the old model is very powerful, I used the old blender alot, but the leaking got worse and worse. I now have it in my basement, if they come out with the gasket for my old model I would order several as this machine has many years of service left. (You did have to be careful not to unscrew the jar from the base inadvertantly while full of liquid, if you did you would have a huge mess.)"
4,Use for Smoothies,"I bought this item primarily for use of making smoothies. I make them daily for my husband & I b/c he works out in the heat & b/c of nutritional value. I'd had a cheaper blender before & it had worn out. After much research, I bought this blender b/c of ratings & price which was reduced due to the color being white. I have to say it works great on frozen fruits except for mangoes which I find are slippery. I have to rearrange thm in the blender a few times with a spoon to finally get them smooth. It takes apart & cleans easily. This my first Kitchen Aid product. So far I'm satisfied overall."
1,Don't buy it Its Flawed,"I wanted a blender that would be the last one I would ever have. I knew I wanted a stainless steel container and a powerful motor. The Kitchen Aid (MODEL KSB55SS0B3) had all this. It worked perfectly, until the rubber COUPLER that was mentioned earlier got worn out. Now I find that Kitchen Aid has no replacement. It took two years to happen but eventually it has to happen. Bummer the stainless steel container, the blade and the motor have a long life expectancy, but can't get a replacement part to make it work! If I was Kitchen Aid, and I knew about this flaw I would not continue to sell this to unknowing consumers. I saw a vita mix at a local home show the other day. It is guaranteed for 7 years and the coupler is not made of rubber.It is a very sturdy metal coupler. What does that tell you? I will get a vita mix!"
3,Very good with several important deficiencies,"This blender has some excellent qualities but has some annoying ones as well. My least favorite is that when you are blending anything solid (fruit, ice etc.) the blender leaves some solid chunks in the bottom that must be caught under the blade. I also agree with the first review regarding the blades. These are dull. They will puree, but did not do as good a job as our old blender with sharp blades. I end up letting it run several minutes longer if I want to try to cut up the fruit skins in a smoothee, etc."
2,Great Ice Crusher/ Poor Blender,"If you are looking for a ""Bar Blender"" to make frozen drinks; this is the one to buy! However, if you are looking to puree fruits and vegetables look elsewhere. The blades are ""Blunt"" made to crush ice, look at the blades of other blenders and you will see the difference. The sharpened edge is likely to chip when crushing ice, but these blunt edged blades are not effective in cutting up, pureeing foods. My jar also leaked badly, but when this was brought to KitchenAid attention, they replaced the jar base. I asked about the pureeing, and was told to slightly freeze the fruit or vegetables, not always practicable."
2,Powerful but problematic.,"Sure it's powerful and will crush ice but it doesn't work well unless it's full (not too full or ingredients will bllow violently out the top - yes it will blow the cover off). Smaller quantities get splattered up on the sides and stay there. Blending - as in making a fruit milkshake - doesn't result in a smooth drink. My previous blenders - with a more tapering base (and a lot cheaper, too) worked better."
2,UNDERPERFORMER BLENDER,"I have been using this blender for 6 months now,and I am not impressed with it. Power Shakes are my favorite, but this thing will not crush ice,frozen fruit, or even a banana without leaving chunks and lumps in my drink. I have had much better performance with a cheap blender."
2,More power than it can handle - not durable,"I bought this for my wife thinking it would be the last and best blender I would ever buy her, based on the brand, price and the solid feel.It's been replaced twice because the rotor/teeth connection to the base of the jar has broken (just BARELY within the warranty period). It literally stripped the threads and broke the bolt. Wow. Now it's out of warranty, and broke off two teeth (not suprising, since they're plastic). Sadly, a large motor and a solid blade mean nothing if the the connection can't handle the power, and it can't, even with the step start function.So if you want a powerful, solid, great looking blender that MIGHT last you a year, this is the one for you. I personally will be replacing it with something else."
5,No disappointment here...,"I have made great smoothies and frozen drinks with this blender. I have not had any problems with it crushing ice. I make my smoothies with frozen strawberries, bananas, blueberries and do not get the chunks other reviews mention. Sometimes I throw ice in them. I've had it since the beginning of August and make smoothies at least 3 times a week, frozen drinks (mostly frozen virgin daquiris) on the weekends. These particular drinks were a concern since other reviews reported inefficiency but so far I haven't had any problems. I usually pulse the ingredients a few times then let her rip, lol."
2,For the price it should puree and crush ice,"I got this blender 1 1/2 year ago. I do not like it. I need for it to make bean purees, banana shakes, and a lot of salsas. It does a horrible job doing that. I have had cheaper blenders than do a much better job. It does a good job crushing ice, but I seldom need to do that."
3,Not a good choice if you use frozen fruit to make smoothies,"My wife makes a smoothie every morning using yogurt, frozen fruit, etc. Our old [$$$] machine did a great job with this, but when it broke we decided to get a higher quality machine. Since we have a KitchenAid mixer and food processor (which we love!), we got this blender because they look good together on the counter top.But as several reviewers have noted, this design really doesn't do a great job with frozen fruit. You have to leave it running a long time and the results are not smooth. There are still large chunks of fruit left.We took this back and got a Waring Pro model...which is very noisy, but does a great job in quickly making smoothies with frozen fruit."
1,Broke the first time I used it,"A friend gave us one of these a few years ago. The blade assembly came loose from the drive gears the first time I made a frozen margarita. As noted in many other reviews here, Kitchen Aid doesn't sell the replacement parts.Also, some friends have/had this blender. I used theirs several times, and noted that it does a HORRIBLE job making frozen margaritas. It will NEVER chop up all the ice. Leaves chunks of ice cubes in the drink.(...)"
2,Barely adequate,"As others noted, this blender has a problem pureeing/liquifying, tending to leave large chunks in the blend, even if you let it run for a reallly long time. Especially daunting were frozen whole strawberries. No longer a problem, tho, because the plastic drive mechanism has lost several teeth and the machine can no longer be used. I have had to fall back on my mother=in=law's cast-off Osterizer, circa 1970. Hoping for something better from KitchenAid."
2,Rubber coupler poorly designed,"Looks great, Heavy, powerful. I have all Kitchen aid products. They look great together.The problem is with making smoothies. Frozen fruit is apparently hard to push around. It catches on the sides and jambs the blade.The blade is spun by this small black toothed gear attached to the top of the motor. It's made of a rubberized plastic type material which is molded over a metal piece. That connection will break as experienced by other users.I'll assume that that type of mixing may have not been anticipated by the engineers. All other tyes of general blending may not tax that connection as hard as frozen fruit.Therefore if you blend frozen fruit get a different mixer.I got a Waring Pro uses the same designed coupler but is replaceable for $5."
1,was great! ... at first,"I'm sorry to see other people are experiencing the same blade assembly problem with their blenders. When the blender was operational, I loved using it. But, in 5 years of infrequent use, I have replaced my blade assembly twice. It broke again a few weeks ago, and now KitchenAid says they don't sell the part anymore! They want to sell me a whole new blender!"
2,"good brand, but not so good blender","I bought this blender because I love the KitchenAid standmixer. It's powerful, but that's about it. When the caraffe is on the blender, if you turn it a bit instead of lifting, the bottom comes off, and the contents of your blender can spill everywhere. KitchenAid definitely needs to fix this major flaw. I threw mine in the garbage after a few disasters."
1,okay if you want to replace every couple years,"I received my blender as a gift but didn't use it much the first 2 or 3 years--maybe about 15 times. However, on about the 16th time, the blade assembly broke and the blade wouldn't spin. When I called KitchenAid, they sold me another one for $20 plus s&h. Then, I started using it more, mainly to puree soup and make fruit smoothies. Both came out okay, but often a little lumpy, plus the lid always leaked if it was half full or more. Within two years, the same thing happened to the blade! When I called KitchenAid again, they offered to sell me a reconditioned one for $30--as if I would give them anymore money for shoddy products! I'm doing more research to buy a new one--not a KitchenAid this time!"
3,Not a good choice if you use frozen fruit to make smoothies,"My wife makes a smoothie every morning using yogurt, frozen fruit, etc. Our old $40 machine did a great job with this, but when it broke we decided to get a higher quality machine. Since we have a KitchenAid mixer and food processor (which we love!), we got this blender because they look good together on the counter top.But as several reviewers have noted, this design really doesn't do a great job with frozen fruit. You have to leave it running a long time and the results are not smooth. There are still large chunks of fruit left.We took this back and got a Waring Pro model...which is very noisy, but does a great job in quickly making smoothies with frozen fruit."
1,"Low price, but comes with serious flaw.","This blender is just ok for the money.I gave it one star because there is a serious problem with the blade assembly. After light use for about 6months, I have found that liquid leaks out the blade shaft underneath. This is evident as a build-up of a thin ring of mould on the casing around the shaft, as liquid is thrown off the spinning shaft (I didn't think one needed to scrub out the underneath - its supposed to be water-tight!).It now runs roughly, in contrast to the smooth operation when I first purchased it.I am not sure whether others have noted this problem. Perhaps it is a quality control issue and I had the misfortune to get a dud.I do not recommend this blender. Overall, I wish I had saved my money for something better."
2,It cannot puree,"I got this as a christmas present so I felt bad selling it, but I had to. It seemed like such a bummer that such a well constructed and powerful blender can't liquify anything (even though it's got a button for that). The blender has a deliberately DULL blade and I could never can a reasonably smooth puree. There's a lot of nice things to say about this blender and it's very easy to take apart and clean. Which is why I was hoping KitchenAid would have a SHARP replacement blade somehow available (think of their mixers and how much attachment stuff they make for that). That would make all the difference in the world to just swap a sharp blade in for soups, and putting the dull one back in for crushing ice or whatever. As far as I know, they don't make a sharp blade for this. Too bad."
2,It will break,"The black coupler will break and you'll need to get that part replaced. It's easy to replace, but you have to find the part. I suggest buying a few of these parts if you already have this blender. If you are thinking about purchasing this blender, don't. It's not that powerful, parts are expensive, things tend to break easily..."
1,No! Don't crush ice with it!,"Several reviewers suggested that the blender can be used to crush ice. Don't do it! My primary use for blenders is making fruit juice slushies. Unfortunately, an ice cube wedged between the blade and the bottom of the jar and the plastic rotor -- not sure what you call it, but the piece that couples the base to the blender blade -- ended up in little pieces. I suspect getting the blender repaired wouldn't be worth the time and cost, so the blender will be going into the trash."
3,Response to negative Reviews,"I, too, purchased this blender and noticed the burning smell and noises that made me think it was falling apart or going to catch on fire! My handy spouse took the bottom off and oiled the parts as he thought it sounded like it needed a lube job. Since doing so, the blender works much better, the smell is gone and the motor is quieter. Take a minute to hit it with WD-40 on the inside and see if it helps. No complaints on blending ability..."
2,Lot of Money for mediocre product,As mentioned in other posts this blender leaves a lot of chunks in the bottom. I use mine every morning for protein shakes and I always have banana chunks left over at the bottom. The design of the plastic base that is attached to the glass is also poor. If you leave the unit assembled while in the dishwasher you get about two cups of water after it runs through the cycle. I think I can fix this by drilling some holes in it but I may get too much noise. Other than that it is quiet however I will search for a different brand next time.
1,all looks,"My wife and I received this blender as a gift and were excited about it's sleek and durable appearance. Unfortunately, the blender had many problems and ended up broken after a year! The gasket under the lid never fit properly and leaked all the time, and the bearing for the blades broke just after the warenty expired. Like some of the other reviewers, we found that the spare parts needed to fix it were unavialable so now I can strongly recommend against this product."
1,Total garbage (even for alternative AI approaches),"While Arthur has some good intuitions, I think he takes them too far in the wrong directions. He's proposing an architecture that requires long-term investment and planning, without showing that it will work even on small scales. These types of crackpot ideas are a dime a dozen, especially in the field of General Artificial Intelligence"
1,Canadian Pacific,"I bought a copy of this movie and it's very dark and hard to view ,a bad reproduction of a great flim.Thanks Ed"
1,OUTDATED INFORMATION,This book is too old and the information within is outdated. Too much has changed and I would not recommend this book at this time to anyone.
1,Be careful!,"Please take note of the publication date - 1997. This means all the data is at least 5 years old (probably much older due to the time lag between gathering data and publication). Therefore information such as housing prices, job markets etc are all woefully out of date. It may have some interesting information, but don't bother using this book if you're looking for information on job situation, real estate or even taxes."
3,Just OK,"The book is put together very well and is easy to read. Now for the negatives. Most of the information is old which makes it unusable. It's OK for a starting point, but you'll be going back to the internet for up-to-date information."
2,outdated,This would be an excellent and thorough book were it not nine years old. The information on cost of living is useless because so much has changed.
4,LIfe sized veggies,"I was very pleased with this toy. The veggies, with the exception of the lettuce, are life sized. They are durable, realistic and colorful. My 18 mo. old daughter put them to use right away, naming the veggies and fruits and then feeding them to her doll.I am very pleased with this product. Out of all of the pretend food that is out there, this is the best that I have seen by far."
5,Great Toy but a Few of the Fruits were Duds,"Don't get me wrong-I LOVE THIS TOY!!! (and so does my 18M old daughter) but I did notice that a few of the fruit pieces were less durable than others. Specifically, the pear arrived to me already crushed (made from very thin plastic) and the banana seems like the next one to ""deflate"". But most of the fruits are made from much thicker, stronger plastic. The basket is adorable and the fruit and vegetables are very realistic looking. Even without the pear, it provides my daughter hours of fun!"
5,Great fruit and veggie set,We bought this set for our 15 month old daughter for Christmas and she loves it. She plays with it every day and pretends to eat all of the fruits and veggies. The pieces are pretty true to real life in size and color. I love that it comes with a basket to store everything as well. I was definitely not disappointed.
5,Great for toddlers,"We bought this for our granddaughter who is just shy of two years old. Once she opened it on Christmas she spent the next hour picking up, arranging and trying to name the different fruits/vegetables. She has a little brother who is six months old so if she forgets to put them up right away he is in no danger because they are baby friendly. Great gift for an age when they are as happy playing with boxes as expensive toys."
5,great healthy play,My 3 grandsons love this line of toys. They have all 3 of these and even play store. adorable game play
3,"Generally Good, but could be better","I bought these for my 16 month old son for Christmas. They are good, but I was expecting better based on other reviews. A few items are made of harder plastic and a few of softer plastic. They are basicly life sized, with the exception of the lettuce and I think the apple is a bit small. Nothing was small enough that I felt it needed to be taken away until he is older. The coloration is a bit odd too, with some lighter areas. Maybe this is from the production, but it takes away from the naturalness. The pear's stem was broken when my son threw it on our tile floor and the tomato came with a dent in it. All that, however does not take away from the fact that my son likes to play with them and it has helped him to learn his fruits and veggies."
3,Disappointing for younger children,"After purchasing the lunch food basket (which I would highly recommend) for my 8-month-old son, I was disappointed with the fruit and vegetable selection in this set. Unlike the lunch set, this set is mainly hard plastic (not chewable rubber). Also, the strawberries were too small and choking hazards. I have decided to put away most of these items until he is much older. For now, we will stick to the rubber foods."
1,"I was very dissapointed in this toy.So unreal.No common fruits..No apple ,orange Grapes etc The colors were off It was not fun.","Learning Resources Fruit & Vegetable Play Food Basket, Set of 13I was very dissapointed in this toy..So unreal.The texture and Color were so off.Where were the common fruits...Orange,Apple Etc...They were not fun.I would return but it is too big a hassle...Never again"
5,"Realistic, lightweight and fun","My 15 month old loves these. They are lightweight (since they are not wood), so no owies when he bops his friends or siblings in the head with the apple. They are very realistic and a good quality. The plastic is sturdy and does not dent. The basket is well made, the handles do not pop off."
4,Nice toy!,"this is a great toy for the kids to play with, they learn about the vegetables and get a carrying basket also. the handles are a nice small size for the kids' hands."
5,Excellent fruit basket,This looks very real. We are very pleased. The only think I don't like is the handles move with difficulty. Perhaps that will improve over time.
4,"a totaly inspiring, worth your time kind of book","This book is about Bethany Hamilton, and her amazing come-back after a shark bit off her left arm. Bethany explains what happened before, during, and after (immedietly, and a while after) the attack. She expresses her love for and belief in God, and tells about how He helped her through this huge trial in her life. It is very well written, and easy to read. I'd say the grade level to read this book would be 5th or 6th grade and up. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for an easy read, that is both interesting and very inspiring. However, be aware that the events that happened in the movie Soul Surfer, really happened a lot differently than in real life. When you start reading it, make sure you remember that and don't get too confused. All in all, this is a great book that is totaly worth your time. I really liked it!"
4,soul surfer,very inspirational book. Was amazed the movie followed the book so closely. I actually bought this copy to give to a Christian friend and they were inspired as well.
4,Good for young adults,"This was written for a young adult audience, so I have to say it did not read well for me but I enjoyed the her story. I am inspired by her fearlessness and bravery. I am so glad for her that she was able to get past her accident and fear and accomplish her goals. She is a perfect role model for young girls and women."
2,Boringgg!!!!!,"Personally I would not recommend this book unless you are a full on Christian. For more than half the book all she talks about is how all she did was pray and that God got her through all of her problems, and how her church and faith helped her most. The book was very boring, and every page was like the page before. My mind would always wander when I would read, because there was nothing exiting. So this is probably not the best book to read."
2,Tells A Good Tale But Could Be Better,"This is a good inspirational story except it got slow at times and boring. This is a story that should be great and cool to hear about because not a lot of people get bitten by a shark that often but it was not told that great. I was hoping for something better but it didn't happen. Sorry, maybe next time."
5,SOUL SURFER! BEST BOOK EVER...,"This book is about A 13 year old girl named Bethany Hamilton who loved to surf. That was like her life hobby until one Halloween day when she got attacked by a 15 foot long shark. That's a scary thing to hear, but it does happen, and the fact that she believed in God got her through this long struggle of faith and friendship. After this happened, she was kind of scared to get on the board again, but she did it. And I don't think she's going to stop!!!! To find out the rest, read this awesome book."
2,Getting back up,I love this book and movie so much it has shown me that even though you get knocked down it doesn't mean that you can't back up.
3,kindle book for book report,my son had to have a non-fiction book for a book report. he will only read off the kindle. he told me all about it. which means he did read it. lol i thought i was a lot of money to spend on a book that would be read only once.
5,Enjoyable autobiography,In this autobiography Bethany Hamilton dicusses topics from her childhood to her faith. This is a truly inspirational book. One of the best autobiographies I have ever read!
5,Beautiful story !!,"Much better when you read the book instead the movie,even so the movie was awesome the book has many details...."
4,Inspirational,"I read this book a few years ago and she wrote this book that made me feel inspired. Bethany describes her encounter with a shark and how she dealed with the experience- her pain, fears and emotions. She is a true fighter and this story shows what an inspiration she is to others. I won't forget reading this because she has a strong faith and proves how we get back to what we love to do in our life no matter what our fears are...I look forward to watching the movie."
4,Absolutely amazing story,This story is absolutely incredible! I can't wait for the movie later in 2011. The prose is easy to follow and quite interesting! Get this book for your teenagers or pre-teens! Excellent storytelling about dealing with tragedy and disappointment and overcoming!
5,Better Than The First Version,"This movie tie-in version is much better than the original 2004 version. Not only does Bethany talk about how she helped make the movie about her life, but it has interviews with the actress AnnaSophia Robb who played Bethany, the director Sean McNamara, and the actress Lorraine Nicholson who played Bethany's friend Alana. It also contains new photos taking up to 5 pages. For anyone who wants to know why Bethany Hamilton is such a hero today, this is the book to buy. The way Bethany wrote this book makes it feel like her emotions are ours. This book will bring tears of emotion both happy and sad to your eyes, as it did for me. You'll enjoy this!"
5,Awesome book,Great book and movie and I loves the pics at the end. It was a great story and I loved the movie so much!!!
4,Enjoyable true life story with some positive life lessons.,"I bought this for my grade school aged niece (it's a young adult readers book), but decided to read it first. Who can forget Bethany's story of getting her arm bit off by a huge shark? It was interesting to learn about her family. Both of her parents moved to Hawaii when they were young to follow their passion for surfing. They met up while working at the island's resorts, and raised their kids to surf as soon as they could. Bethany is a very accomplished surfer, with endorsements from surfing clothes and board manufacturers, and it's uplifting to know she is still surfing and still doing well in competitions after the accident. Bethany mentions that she is happy to do interviews (which she admits are tedious) as long as she can mention what Christ has done for her life."
5,Jackie's review from Soul Surfer,"They say Bethany Hamilton has saltwater in her veins.How else could one explain the passion that drives her to surf?Soul Surfer is a amazing book in many ways.I think it is a good book because she explains every detail you need to picture in your mind. To her it was a normal day for surfing. Until after she was attacked by a shark and lost her arm. It is amazing how she survived, with one reason at that was God on her side. She kept her surfing style the same even after the attack. She loves the sport just as much. It is outstanding how she paddled all the back with one arm. I think this is a terrific book because it shows you to never give up on what you love. I think people should read this book and get the extreme feeling that she got from explaining the details. It is a great book for all ages!"
1,Yellow Streaks,"Scanning family pictures and documents, YELLOW STREAKS all down Left and Right sides. HORRIBLE QUALITY even at 600dpi. Don't waste your cash on this, get a real scanner. That would be an Epson scanner for those who don't know."
2,Difficult to install and use,"I got this scanner to replace a much older HP scanner (which I loved) that had no driver for Windows XP. The older scanner was easy to install and easy to use. It had many good features. I assumed that this scanner would be an ever better version. I was wrong. This scanner has issues with the CD installation. Sometimes it quits working and I have to reinstall. It never seems to install the same way twice. When I can get it to install enough that I can actually scan, the software requires many more steps to actually get a document/graphic/photo scanned than the older scanner. And, this scanner is very, very slow. I miss my old scanner. I will probably trash this one and look at another brand."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!,"I have had this scanner for a little over a year. It has never made good copies/scans from a negative. I often have to rescan things. The software has now completey failed and I have to use a microsoft product to get it to work, and most of the time the scanner will not come on. It is very tempremental. I often have to jiggle cords and unplug things and mess around for an hour just to scan something."
2,Worthless for slides/negatives!,"Despite some reviews, I took the chance that the slide and negative scanning abilities of the HP 3970 *might* be ok... they are NOT. Whatever the specs may say, you can only scan up to 2 negatives or 1 slide at a time. The lamp DOES have to warm up AGAIN after each scan session, even if your last one was just moments before. This makes just waiting for a preview excruciating! Next, the scan time to actually scan a negative at only 300 dpi is about 45-60 sec.Long and short- this scanner was set up and tested and now is going back to the store... all within about 1 hour.I didn't even bother trying the regular image scan functions, as all I'm really interested in right now is scanning negatives and slides. I'm sure the basic functions are good, as HP does have a decent rep for flatbed scans.The software installed easily though in Windows XP Pro. It did seem a bit clunky, but I didn't bother playing with it enough to let it bother me."
4,Getting better daily,"If your looking for a decent scanner for a low price, the ScanJet 3970 Digital Flatbed Scanner is a good choice. The lamp takes a little while to warm-up and the scanner is somewhat noisy when it copies the image, but the quality of the scan and ease of use is above average. The individual functions and settings are easy to understand and allow some basic photo manipulation. The more I use the scanner, the more I like it."
2,you get what you pay for,"I just wanted to warn everyone about this scanner. Now it does scan regular items like documents and large pics well, its 35mm slide and negative scans are very poor. I cleaned off the the plate and the film and still got a cloudy image. I know the image is not off because I view it with a slide viewer and the image is crystal clear. Every setting I've changed does not improve the image. Also startup sounds like a construction site. If you're looking for a simple scanner for a cheap price then by all means, but if you're a serious hobbyist then really look elsewhere."
2,Great For Photo's Crap For The Rest,This Scanner is wonderfull for scanning your old pics but it is extremly difficult to scan negatives it can be done if you have a couple of hours and a lot of patience and i do mean a lot of patience the software is its main problem i think the scanner itself is fully capable but the software sucks it does scan documents well if you change the software settings but who wants to do that every single time if you leave the settings alone you wind up with a nice gray graphic in the center of the page that looks exactly like the slide tray in the lid
1,Could not get software to work,"I bought this scanner to replace a piece of crap UMAX scanner that I got free with a Dell PC purchase. This scanner was not much better. The only way I could get it to scan is by using XP scanning. First of all, the box was missing all software and instructions. I tried to download the appropriate software online and it would not install properly. I called customer support and they sent me a CD in the mail 5 days later that was supposed to have the correct software on it. It was the same crappy software that I downloaded a week before on the internet. Calling customer support again, I became frustrated when the individual, barely speaking English could not help me. I am returning the scanner and buying a better quality product. For all you people who had flawless installs, I don't know what you did but I don't have the patience to put up with this piece of crap anymore."
2,An HP Miss,"I found the software cumbersome, and always used software that came with my Samsung. Scans turned out fine, but speed was slow.After six months of use I started getting error messages. After corresponding with the e-mail tech support, I determined that it is a problem with the TMA lamp. Even though the TMA is in the lid, it involves a problem in the base that disables the entire scanner. I had just assembled some negatives and slides to use with the TMA, but never got to use it before the unit died.The tech support system worked well to pinpoint the problem, but it was some time, a lot of emails, and a phone call before someone told me that it was out of warrantee. (I am sorry, I don't remember all the warrantee periods for everything I buy.) This went on after I had already given my date of purchase early in the process. You would think that HP would train its support staff to notice this earlier."
1,"Poor software, poor copies, great photos with patience","With some effort, I was amazed at the great photo copying ability of the scanner although the software makes you want to smash it immediately. Very difficult to use and resets itself at every opportunity. As a copier for text documents it is HORRIBLE!!! Using the print mode on a text document yields pixelated, grainy unreadable prints. This is TOTALLY unacceptable! Isn't that what a scanner is supposed to do first and then for the additional money be a good photo copier? Like one other reviewer, my HP scanner now also has a greasy fog on the inside of the glass plate. Wonderful. I wasted weeks trying to untangle the software difficulties and now am ready to leave this junk on the doorstep of the seller and buy a Canon Scanner like I should have done in the first place. Do not waste your money. HP needs to do a lot better."
1,This scanner is unusable for slides/negatives,"I normally like HP products, so I was extremely disappointedin this scanner. The software is pretty bad (e.g., theresolution setting kept going back to 200 dpi when I selected ahigher resolution). This is the third scanner I've owned,and by far the worst. The scanner is agonizingly slow, andevery slide I scanned turned out green, regardless of thesettings I selected. I played around with the various settingsand tried for hours to get an acceptable image from thisscanner. The green images were the clincher for me - I'mreturning this scanner ASAP and plan to purchase anEpson."
4,solid scanner for the price,"I don't know what scrappy's problem was, but my scanned slides turned out to be gorgeous. My old Umax Astra always blocked up slides and negatives with excessive contrast, but the HP scans them with no problem. Prints are a cinch. I don't find the wait excessive at all-- maybe fifteen seconds, which is hardly interminable for a USB device.The software is good, but not great. It certainly doesn't have the sophistication of the Adoble Elements that come with Epson scanners, but it's fine for basic image manipulation. It seems to reset to prints with each new scan, which is inconvenient but not insurmountable for slides and negatives.For a hundred bucks, it's a great piece of hardware. And in my experience, HP equipment is MUCH more durable than Epson."
1,Ugh! 3 Am Madness!,I am going to burn this thing! I have spent 5 hours messing with this stupid thing and nothing works! I have downloaded every driver update etc. HP just sucks...
2,Very Disapointed,I agree with scrappy. I couldn't get my negatives to scan properly either. The quality of the photo scanning was adequate but I scanned in the same picture at the same settings (300 DPI) (4X6 to 8X12) with both the HP and my Epson Perfection 610 (it's at least 4 or 5 years old) and I was hard pressed to see the difference in quality. I'm returning the HP ASAP. Update: Since returning this scanner I have purchased the EPSON Perfection 2400. For the extra 50 bucks I got incredible results with scanning negatives. I think even Paul would agree that if you are going to spend a hundred dollars it's worth spending a few more to get a truely superior scanner.
1,Do Not Waste Your Money ....,"I was very disapointed when i bought this book, i was expecting to make a lot of cool things, i did not find one item that i was interested in making. They show a lot of decorating on flower pots, picture frames, watering cans, lamps and boxes. The only idea i got from this book was when they cut out different pictures and decorated the dresser's drawers with a different picture from a magazine. It had a really cool effect look to it. Other than that, i am sorry that i ever purchased this book, Do not waste your money !! I will be selling it on ebay very soon !"
1,Warning: NOT alt history,"Amazon recommended this book to me and having read the description of the content and the praise in some of the comments about it this seemed justified. Even if I had some doubts its basic idea, namely that the Boer War was an event that defined the beginning of the decline of the British Empire, is one I share. Being also a fan of alt history I ordered the book and started to read. I got as far as page 132 before I decided to quit.Since I neither own a bulldog nor ever aspire to do so I guess I was disqualified from enjoying it. Because this book is NOT alt history but should rather be qualified as fantasy. God makes an appearance and tells us that a) the Jews are His chosen people and b) that bulldogs are his chosen dogs.Sometimes amazon lures you into buying trash."
4,Makes a cute gift,"This book is a little cutey, with great pooch pics and well-chosen quotes to accompany the photos. Would make a lovely small gift for the dog-lover in your life. For a more substantial book for gift-giving to the canine-captivated, I thoroughly recommend 101 Salivations by Rachel Hale."
5,Kids with Celiac Disease,"If you have a child that has been diagnosed with Celiac Disease, this book will explain everything you need to know about coping with the disease. It will be an invaluable tool toward helping you and your child learn more about being gluten-free and healthy. This is the best source I have found so far. It made the entire process a little less scary."
5,A Must Read for Parents of Celiac Kids!!!,"Like most parents, we were pretty shell-shocked by my 5 yr old son's diagnosis. I spent hours on the Internet researching Celiac Disease. Problem was, most of the information was geared towards adults. My initial response was less concerned with what he could eat and more concerned with how am I going to make sure he feels ""normal""? What will I pack for lunch at school? How can I send him to school without something happening? How will I deal with the 5 birthday parties he has in the next month? Danna Korn's book answered all of those questions and the other 1000 I forgot to think of. This book is a life saver. My son started Kindergarten 3 days ago and I feel like all is well. I read it cover to cover in one night. As parents of celiac kids, we are not alone. Danna Korn helps you see that."
2,Meh,"I'm a big W.R. Burnett fan. I love his great crime novels: Little Caesar, High Sierra, Asphalt Jungle. When I stumbled upon this title, I thought, oh, this is going to be good. Unfortunately, it's not. It chronicles the game from the perspective of an anonymous, contrarian, supposedly wise ex-ballplayer. But the wisdom here seems very ill-considered, at times downright wrongheaded 40 years down the road. The whole take seems dated and tired. It's just no good -- and a real disappointment coming from Burnett."
2,obscured by the darkness,"Winter Light was striking in its sordid irony...not just the title with the content, but the content with reality. A man ""of the cloth"", presumably one who knows and loves the God he represents to his flock, and in whose Name he works and speaks, is in fact an atheist wolf in sheep's clothing. The ""pastor's"" hypocrisy and vilification of Christianity reaped precisely what it sowed; the wretched distribution of despair. The moral of the movie; unbelief = hell. For that I give it 2 stars."
4,"INGMAR BERGMAN, OPUS 24","**** 1962. Written and directed by Ingmar Bergman. Three hours of a pastor's life in the Swedish countryside. Gunnar Björnstrand doesn't manage to find the right words to prevent Max von Sydow's suicide. Note also the 6 minutes long close-up of Ingrid Thulin reading the letter she sent to Gunnar Björnstrand, a scene that has nothing to envy to the then recent innovations of the French New Wave. WINTER LIGHT is an austere and ascetic film worthy to stay in your library. Highly recommended."
5,Great Soundtrack,"This is a great soundtrack to great Australian movie, ""Two Hands"". ""These Days"" by Powderfinger and ""Luckey Star"" by Alex Lloyd are fantastic songs by great Australian artists."
2,"A novel, not history.","Passable as a novel, worthless from an historical point of view.An example of blunder from chapter 12, ""In battle"". The author writes: ""Mahomet Scirocco (commander of the Turkish right wing) himself was killed in the hand-to-hand fighting. His body, floating face downwards in the sea running red with blood, was recognized by his gorgeous apparel. Venetian soldiers promptly chopped off his head and raised it on high - the dismal sight took the heart out of the Turks.""In actual fact Mahomet Scirocco, severely wounded, was taken prisoner by the Venetians and died four days later; the Turks, in spite of the Christian superior firepower, battled to the end with their usual heart and rage."
3,Not nearly as good as the original battery.,Sorry to say that when I replaced my old battery thinking I would get a weeks worth of charge out of the new one (as I had at the beginning with the original battery) I was sorely disappointed. I only got about 3 days at first. Three stars because the battery works and fits my phone.
1,No Libretto,"Regardless of the merits of the performance, there is no libretto included. I was able to find it all on the net, in french, without translation. I read french, so that's not a hardship, but having 70 pages of printout to deal with when I wantto listen to 2 CDs is a problem. I wouldn't have bought it had I known. And this is EMI!!! Even Erato includes a libretto. [...]That being said, Gretry is BRILLIANT. The songs are catchy, beautiful, tender, memorable. The performance is crisp and convincing. A beautiful experience, and one that has set me to buying up the rest of Gretry's operas."
1,not fit,i was hoping that it can reduce dust in the car..but it is making more...and it does not fit well.
4,found a hard-to-find item,"I've looked and looked for these bags for my very old dirt devil hand vac, and finally found them on Amazon. A perfect fit. Will order more."
2,Lot's of Information Presented all over the place,"First of all, I was looking for a book written more along the lines of the George Chauncey's, ""Gay New York: Gender, Urban Culture, and the Making of the Gay Male World, 1890-1940"". This book is well researched and clearly proves that their was a thriving gay culture in San Francisco well before the Stonewall uprising in New York. The idea that San Francisco was able to sustain a gay community based upon its ""wide open"" ideology and its status as a shipping port and military base also helped further cement this position as a gay bulwark in America. The only problem I had with this book, is that it covers alot of minutia which makes it somewhat of a laborious read and I found myself skipping ahead. All in all, this is a good book and is priced right for a digital book."
5,snowman at Night,"I've received this book & given it as a gift several times. It is good for young childrem, simple to read & the illustrations are beautiful. It is a great gift for new parents or grandparents. Also the the other book Snowmen atChristmas is just as great."
3,Snowmen,I bought this book as a Christmas gift for a grandson. I have no idea whether he will like it or not but it sounded like a cute book to me.
3,Great Book!!,Our family really enjoyed the book. My children especially enjoyed looking for the hidden pictures.
3,"good book, not great condition","I have ordered many books from better world books and have never been disappointed. However this book (which I was giving as a Christmas present for my daughter's teaching library) came in terrible condition. The book must have gotten wet at some point because it is badly warped. I kept it, but will be unhappy when she opens it."
5,Favourite story,A delightful rhyming story coupled with finding hidden images. Great for beginning readers and it is a favourite in our house. Images are detailed and beautifully done.
4,Snowmen books are wonderful,"I have the 'board book' of Snowmen at night and wanted to get one for my grand daughter. A larger paper back came. I was disappointed but just gave the board book to her and kept the paper back at my house. Give the Snowmen books a look. They are so sweet. I love books that ryhme and the Snowmen books all have a wonderful surprise inside!! What ever I need can usually find it on Amazon, mostly free shipping and delivery is very quick."
5,SURE TO BECOME A CLASSIC!,"I've read this book countless times to my 2 1/2 yr old son and he loves loves it. The story is original, beautifully illustrated and just plain fun for an adult to read over and over as a bedtime story. A must have for any childrens library!"
2,disappointed,"I was very disappointed to find a crushed box that showcases the set; even more, I was dissatisfied with the size of the book. Perhaps the dimensions of the actual book should be in the description. Had I known the book was going to be so small, I would have bought the hardcover option instead."
4,Fun for the winter,Fun book to read during the winter season. My daughter is 5 and we've read it the last couple of years and she really likes it.
5,This Series of Snowmen Books are excellent,This book like others in the Series by Caralyn Buehner and pictures by Mark Buehner are wonderful children's books. If a parent or grandparent want good stories and great pictures to read and show children get this book and others in the series.
4,Want to know what snowmen really do at night?,"This was so adorable, and unpredictable. My grandchildren enjoyed it and I purchased an extra copy to share with their day care center. The silly things these snowmen do while your sleeping."
5,We LOVE this book!,"This is by far my daughter's favorite book, and one of my favorites to read to her. She is two and a half, and we love finding the hidden pictures. The illustrations are beautiful, and the subtle rhyming keeps you going. We could read it over and over, and have several times. We have shared it with her cousins, ages ranging from 3 - 10, and they all love it. My sister is a preschool teacher, and she has now incorporated it into her yearly program. We live in a very snowy area, the High Rockies of Colorado, and its a great way for her to ""understand"" where the snowmen go that we build. GET THIS BOOK! Your child will love it. (Also check out the other's... Snowmen All Year and Snowmen at Christmas.)"
5,Great to get the imaginations going,"We love this book along with the Snowmen at Christmas. My girls imaginations were just reeling after reading this book. I bought it to read on the first day of snow when we're going to have a pajama day and drink hot cocoa while the snow comes down. Really great illustrations and hidden pictures to find! I did not know hidden pictures were in there, my newly 6 year old read that in the back of the book and set right to searching. Great book I highly recommend it! This is a book I'll have to buy 2 of for each child to have when they get older."
5,What a darling book!,"I purchased this book after reading the reviews posted here at Amazon and I am so glad that I did! What an imaginative story! It's pretty fun to think about what our snowmen actually do at night - maybe go out for a pizza, grab some cold chocolate, and just generally have a great time ice skating. The imagination in this book is quite wonderful and the illustrations are very cute. Highly recommend this book - you won't be disappointed!"
3,DRAMMA QUEEN WATCH,"THIS IS A NICE WATCH THE ONLY COMPLAINT I HAVE IS IT WAS A LITTLE BIGGER THAN WHAT I HAD EXPECTED IT TO BE ITS HARD TO TELL IF ITS A WOMANS OR MANS WATCH, AND YOU CANT ADJUST THE BAND SIZE BUT THE APPEARANCE OF THE WATCH IS VERY NICE."
4,Cute video for kids,"This is a really cute video. Debby Boone has some fun ways to approach different situations through song, like being afraid of the dark. It's not top on my kid's list of videos, but it is a good quality video."
1,Caveat Emptor,"I ordered this battery and was very disappointed. First, it is larger than the original and sticks out from the contours of the phone. Secondly, after discharging the battery and then fully charging it, it lasted about 24-48 hours, with essentially no talk time.I have contacted the seller for an exchange or a refund and have not heard back yet - not sure that I will.Caveat emptor!"
5,Great Smoothies & More,"I purchased this blender about a month ago. It's awsome! I make smoothies almost every day (with fresh and frozen fruit). It's quick and powerful (not too loud). The smoothies are well... smooth!I love the wide jar. It blends everything (no stopping the blender and scraping the sides to get everything to the bottom). 5 speeds are plenty to do any job. I did alot of research before I bought this blender and I am really happy with it! My husband was stunned by how quick and easy it is.It's easy to clean. A quick tip, after you blend, instead of cleaning. Just rinse out jar, add hot water and a drop of dishwashing liquid and blend. It gets the jar really clean and no scrubbing (even those tiny bits of blueberries that seem to stick on glass)."
1,Mine broke after two uses.,Mine broke and started SMOKING while I was making hummus (not even something tougher like ice). Kitchenaid won't fix it. There are many MUCH cheaper but nicer ones on the market.
2,Disapointed,"I guess after searching and looking at several CD folders at the size that I wanted I forgot to look for the size and quanity of CD's this folder held. However after I recieved it, I went back and searched again for this folder and there was no size or Quanity of CD's held in the description. I thought it was much larger. So my expectations were not met. Oh well, 411 it holds 12 CD's"
4,Pretty good!!,"This is a pretty good album! Without a doubt not his best, but with songs like 'joy ride' 'loves me like a train' and the title track, you will still be very happy with this release!"
1,garbage,ever listen to lyrics that are so contrived that they are painful. Love me like a train? WTF does that mean? Then every word that rthyms with train then gets used but all I hear is pain pain pain.
3,An entertaining sereal.,"The print from which the DVD was made was not the best quality. The overall acting is good for a sereal. The screenplay, most especially, the end leaves something to be desired."
2,Student-style creative writing hurts a book I wanted to like,"It's true: this book is funny (unless you are fervently religious in which case you will probably find not to be funny). It is also annoying, repetitious and single minded. Bo Fowler is a creative writing instructor and this book comes off as an over-long experiment in creative writing. While I like the satirical premise of the ""metaphysical betting shops"" I found the deliberately choppy and repetitious style to be very irritating. This book would have made a nice essay or short story but instead we get a stretched out novel which tries way too hard to be oh so clever with too few ideas. Contrary to what one reviewer wrote, I would say this is a tough book to read-not because of its subject matter but because of its ultra choppy style."
1,A big waste of money,"If you want to spend 8 dollars to get a paper copy of a bunch (well really not that many) of recipes that are easy to find on the internet, go right ahead. I wish I hadn't."
2,Not what I had hoped at all,"This book was extremely disappointing. I bought it expecting it to talk about how to make cordials, instead it teaches how to mix alcohol and syrup. To me, cordial making starts with a raw ingredient (fresh fruit, nuts, herbs, and/or flowers) and then continues from there. If you are interested in learning how to begin making cordials or in gaining new ideas or techniques, look elsewhere. The reason it is getting 2 stars instead of 1 is because there is a little bit of useful information on making extracts, but that informaiton is definitely not worth the price of the book."
3,After pim1 and 2...,"I say no more. I would have bought pim3 but as I come to the end of pim2 Japanese, I think I will find another path. I do these lessons everyday, I work hard at it. Some say this method is too repetitive. Well, yes, but many important things are skimmed over, barely covered. And some very simple things are thrown in your face every single lesson. If only I could find a live online site with tutors, I'd pay money for that. Lucky for me I have several other progs I havent really used yet, like complete japanese and the living language stuff. At least those will keep me into it until I find a tutor or something that really works."
2,Breaking at the Seams,"I am sorry to have to write a negative review for this product. After having it for just 2 years, it began to break at the stress point in the lower seams and the stuffing began falling out. I am a mobile music therapist so this bag has been in-and-out of the trunk of my car all the time. However, my first gig bag (different vendor and more expensive)lasted for 9 years before the zipper broke. We have many expenses in this business and cannot afford to replace gig bags every 2-3 years."
3,Decent bag,"Pretty well padded and seems to be pretty well constructed. My only beef is that the metal rings holding the strap are the weakest link. One of them immediately bent into unusable shape, and now I have to carry it by the handle."
4,Keyboard bag,"Over-all I'm satisfied with the keyboard bag. I like the extra pouches on the outside that allow for sheet music etc. The bag is a bit large for my 61-key Roland E-09 Arranger, so I'm purchasing additional foam to line the ""empty"" space for more protection. I transport and play just one night a week. For this purpose it's great!"
1,too big for Juno GI,bag seems well built but it's wayyyy to big for 61 key Juno GI. am sending back and will keep looking for smaller bag
4,Put My Roland D-50 Synthesizer In This Case,"I placed my Roland D-50 in this case. It didn't fit my Roland D-50 perfectly, it was much larger, but now my Roland D-50 has a case to protect it."
5,Great bag!,"This is a great light weight carrying bag for your portable keyboard. It is not, however, meant to be real protection from damages to the keyboard from it being banged around. It is good as long as you remember not to place objects on top of the keyboard inside it. I used it when we traveled to take the keyboard with us and there is plenty of room for the keyboard, earphones, sustain pedal on the inside and an outside pocket for music. Great value for the price."
4,Rewarding. Provides thought-provoking information.,Architects of the Web helps you make sense of the big-picture changes wrought by the Web. Reid is a great story teller. His work gives you in-depth interviews that take you behind the scenes to learn how a few early Web innovators pioneered through this domain. This book will intrigue new comers on the Net while true Netizens may find the information dated
2,"Some of the background, but not the full story","It has been a few months since I read the book, just never getting back to writing a review. For whatever reason tonight is the night.I found it to be an interesting book, to learn the firsthand accounts of some of the important architects of the WWW; and then some not so important. Opening my eyes to what was really going on in other parts of the world while I was just barely learning the WWW.The reading was for the most part smooth, and easy read actually. If you want to learn part of where we have come from over a weekend go ahead and pick this up."
2,A pre-dot bomb period piece,"Reid's book can safely be characterized as a pre-dot bomb period piece. He writes the history of the Web as the history of making money in wonderously new ways. The actual Ponzi-scheme techniques by which much of the Web's money poured in (for a while) are not explored. But that is fine. Internet historians will refer to this now primary document as financial and cultural historians refer to the U2-can-get-rich books of the late 1920s -- that is, the ones written before the Great Crash of October, 1929."
4,Small and compact.,Good for traveling though buttons to operate alarm are small and unlit. Tough to tell if alarm is on without having to look really close (and turn on a light).
5,Gripping True Crime at its best! You'll read it twice,"I read just about every true crime book that comes out and this one, for me, is definitely in my top five out of many. The writing itself is excellent and the details are outstanding. Truman Simons must certainly be the most dedicated investigator to ever work a murder scene and his dogged dedication alone resulted in finding the murderers and punishing them accordingly. The book was especially intriguing with psychics, one that told the police many ""sightings"" she had that were right on the mark most of the time. This book is so well written that the pain the victim's families felt from losing their children will haunt you for a long time. I promise this is one crime book that you will read repeatedly. If you are a dedicated true crime buff, do your best to find this book and read it! My hardback copy is one of my true crime collection treasures! I've read it three times over the years and each time I couldn't put it down."
2,"Shrek, the full movie","So, do you excpect the whole movie, on one little disk, is going to enertain you? It dosn't unfortunatly, one of the biggest problems, is that the movie is in pictures, what I mean like that, it dosn't scroll through the movie, it's the whole thing was chopped up into the pictures! It almost feels like the audio is thrown off this way. The video quality is terrible too, lots of blurs, and graphic squares pop up too. It was a great idea, turning out bad."
5,A Gem,"When I saw the title, Forgotten English, I realized once again that I may have odd interests, but I'm not alone. Sadly there is not one person in my acquaintance who would understand why I loved this book, and I don't really understand it myself, except to say that I am fascinated by language and ancient words in particular. For me, reading Forgotten English was a very rare pleasure and I didn't want to finish it."
2,"Fun, but does NOT contain words that you can use every day","I actually purchased the day calendar that was produced from this book by Jeffrey Kacirk. The information he provides about each word is fascinating and wonderful! However, this is a book full of words that are forgotten for a reason...they are no longer of much use to those living in our times! Some could be used, but most refer to things that are no longer in use, or to issues or items that we no longer have knowledge of. For instance, there are many words that refer to horses as a means of transportation--since we rarely use them in this manner, the words are not functional for our society.I would highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in history or etymology, but not to those who, like me, are looking for words to add to their current vocabulary. I enjoy the information, but that enjoyment is soured by my dissapointment in not finding words that I can actually use from day to day."
4,topeak mini master blaster dx,Good small light pump no need to switch between presta and schrader because of valve head a little push back when pumping but without a gauge it's a decent indicator when tube is close to optimal psi a good emergency pump to throw in your bag and ride
5,If you read and care about reviews than listen to this one!,"I spent my time researching this product based solely upon user reviews, and I am very happy with my results. This pump is perfect for what I need & want and the price cannot be beaten -- even in-store! Rest assured that the quality of the pump and the enclosed mounting system are exactly as promised. I'm as pleased as punch :)"
5,Topeak Mini Blaster DX,I have to take a minute to say that if you ride a bike then you need to buy this portable pump. It's easy to use and built sturdy. It does requireaverage forearm strength to steady the wheel and pump air into the tire.My only regret is that it took me this long to research it and buy it.
3,"Good pump, weak braket","I was skeptical about a pump that would do both valve types automatically... this was my first smart-head pump. It worked well on my presta's. Pretty good quality pump, seals nice over the valves.Sadly, i only had this on my bike for 4 or 5 rides before the plastic braket broke at the point the screws hold it on to the downtube. I think i ran about 3 or 4 cross-country rides, then one all-mountain type ride and that killed it. Went over a little drop and the braket broke and sent the pump flying. So bummed. I'm carrying it in my backpack now but will probably have to get a new pump because i don't always ride with my pack.If you ride rough trails or do any all-mountain or downhill type stuff, i don't think this is going to hold up for you. I don't do anything crazy and it only held up for a couple of weeks for me."
4,Great Little Pump,This pump works as anticipated and as it should. Easily mounts under water bottle cage. Light weight.
4,Where's Deborah Cox?,"This CD is great music, but beware it does not have the best track of the entire film, which is Deborah Cox's ""Definition of Love"". To get that you need to buy the movie DVDAkeelah and the Bee. Also it is currently on y*utube."
4,Classic Little Anthony!!,"This disc contains Little Anthony's first album on his new label, including the title tune ""On The Outside Looking In"". Of special note is a cut called ""Make It Easy On Yourself"" (not the song you're thinking of). This was on the flip side of the original singles and appears nowhere else. The second LP included on this disc is a waste of the group's talent even though I'm a fan of producer Teddy Randazzo."
5,A book of utterly overwhelming magnitude.,This book is for anyone who finds spirituality in Nature. While short it is full of intense vivid images that each of us whom have lived in the country can relate to. Abbott forms a strong bond through that which is nature and that which is the spirit. Very poetic and lyrical and yet it flows with much ease.
2,Persuasion,"Muy pesado, especialmente para quien no es britanico, por que trata de la vida de la nobleza inglesa en el siglo 19.- Lo abandoné sin terminar.-"
5,Always liked the Bowery boys.,"Not much to say except that if you like the ""Bowery Boys""? (also known as the ""Eastside Kids"") And you have all there movies? Then this is what your looking for if you want more."
3,repackaged Supremes still supreme,"this cd contains songs from one of the best pop, r&b and Broadway-themed albums by the Supremes. Despite it basically flopping, i still like 5:30 Plane, I Keep It Hid, Once In The Morning and Cheap Lovin'."
4,What?!,"I can't believe that there are no reviews of this novel! Rebecca Goldstein is a fascinating writer: to jump from novel writing to a probing study of Kurt Gödel is not what one expects. This novel is a quantum jump (ahem) from her first two, which are (good) academic tales. It is not an easy, linear read (as she says, she presumes a lot from her readers), but extremely evocative, picking up on themes from the earliers ones. If you don't mind being challenged (if you like Iris Murdoch, for example), give it a try. Can't wait to read the later ones."
5,A dark analysis,"I've never reviewed a book on amazon.com before, but feel compelled to rate this one, since it deserves, and so far lacks, a ""five star"". Hedda, a feminist writer with a barren social life, finds an isolated tower to write a new book. Her characters inhabit her, or she inhabits them, drawing her into the world of William James and a mysterious woman astronomer, unexpected revelations, and a range of unusual mental, maybe even psychic phenomena.A bit difficult to read at times, but completely compelling. The first time I tried to read it could not get past the first chapter. The second time, I reached the second chapter and was hooked. I knew nothing about William James, and still know little, but this is not a drawback. Keep a dictionary handy for words like ""embrocate"" as you enter the prose of the nineteenth century."
4,One more Drake thing to put in your collection...,"Nick Drake once sang: ""Now we rise and we are everywhere."" This is true. The folk music of Drake is now omnipresent in pop culture. This is music to listen to with a close friend, girlfriend, or alone before you decided to kill yourself. Nick Drake is often discovered by the discontent youth of every generation. He is like the Kurt Cobain or Ian Curtis of another generation. People like Devendra Banhart have brought back an interest in the music of Drake. Most of Drake's music was previously released in three albums: Five Leaves Left, Bryter Layter, and Pink Moon. Some of this material was released in a box set back in 1986. A new song ""Tow The Line"" was only recently discovered. It may be the last Nick Drake song ever written. It is a beautiful song and totally changes my mind about Drake: he was a genius."
3,Put out a box set already!,"I love Nick Drake, and I fear I'm turning into a sucker by running out and buying every repackaged, recycled album that's put out now. Okay, so there's a new song here and there, but come on already and get a box set out with EVERYTHING on it. Nick Drake fans are avid, even somewhat rabid, and they will buy a box set.This album is solid Nick Drake, but with the exception of a few tracks, it's stuff we've all heard before or have on another album. Save your money on this one, unless you absolutely cannot live without that one Nick Drake song you don't already have."
4,companion to Time Of No Reply,"I would give this CD 5 stars, but there are a few tracks that double when put with the Time Of No Reply CD. Some songs are re-worked and/or put under altered names."
1,what is there is not.,"tea & toast plate,tea pot, why is it you think we have nothing better to do than just look at what you wish you had, twice i have opened a page of yours to find you don't have it in stock. were do i go to find what you do have in stock? for sale?"
1,ignition entertainment wants to steal your money,"Please, whatever you do, don't buy this. I had no intention of reviewing this ""game"" until I noticed that it was actually in the top selling games for the DS (albeit within the top 100, but that's beside the point regarding such filth as this).It's twenty dollars. Sounds cheap, right? Looks kind of funny, right? ""Elf Bowling""! You knock down elves, how hilarious!Okay. Now that you've smiled (or perhaps not) at the thought of knocking down elves mimicking bowling pins, there's absolutely no reason for you or your mom or something resembling a person with a heartbeat to buy this. The two games on here (bowling and shuffleboard) resemble poorly made PC shareware circa 1992, because that's what they pretty much are.Google ""Elf Bowling."" There. Play the two games included on this $20 compilation for FREE. Kinda glad you didn't pay anything for such a mildly amusing fun-for-five-minutes-at-best triviality, huh?"
3,"Nice idea, cute gift, questionable grooming product","My dog seems to enjoy this post-grooming when he's half asleep. When he's awake, he's more interested in chewing on it. I can't think of anything less necessary for the overall care and grooming of a dog. I do have actual knuckles, after all. Perhaps this is the zenith of cute-but-useless pet-based spending, though somehow I fear not."
2,mice build resistance,"This product I thought was a godsend. However, the mice built up a resistance, it seems, to the sound emmitted. You are able to hear the noise and although it's easy to ignore, it's easy to hear at night."
2,Borrow a copy of this book and buy their previous work,"After reading the author's previous work (Successful Project Managers), I couldn't wait to get my hands on this sequel. I was quickly disappointed in this book. The words of wisdom imparted could have been distilled down into a small paperback book. The examples cited were large scale ""mega"" projects that while interesting to read made for little relevance in my own work. There seemed to be a preoccupation with 3rd world projects that sounded more like the evils of ""big business"" picking on small 3rd world governments. The authors, with this book, failed to bring relevant 1997 business problems to the forefront for discussion. My recommendation is to borrow this book from someone and spend your money on their previous work (Successful Project Managers)"
4,West's new book makes life easier for translators.,"Hard-to-find Spanish legal and commercial terminology has become less so with the publication of Tom West's long-awaited dictionary. This small gem includes numerous stumpers, such as apelación subsidiaria, interés jurídico, and testigo de asistencia. West does a real service to translators by providing natural-sounding renderings of many titles of laws, government publications, and cabinet ministries. The country-specific entries (e.g., variations on boleta in Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Venezuela, Argentina, and Mexico; operating expenses in Mexico, Peru, Spain, and Argentina; kinds of taxes in different countries) are invaluable, as are his neat translations of difficult phrases (Proveer de conformidad será justicia; definitivamente firme como ha quedado la anterior sentencia). Explanations of local items (décimo tercer mes, Panama; resolución exenta, Chile) are real time-savers. I'm already looking forward to the next edition!"
4,pop/R&B with Jazzy Groove,She's a Brit based in Italy. Sarah's voice is smoky and powerful. The songs are grown-up-R&B/jazz-funky. Bought the album after catching her act at Ronnie Scott's in London. Great album. It is unfortunate that she is not well known outside of Europe for we are all missing an enormous talent.
3,I bet she likes Tina Turner.,"Brash, sultry and full of soul, Sarah Jane Morris' sound hits a nerve. She collaborated with a number of others in the writing of most songs and there's honesty and vulnerability in her work. About 55 minutes and many great songs."
5,Please don't read - Greatest Investment Advice Ever,Simple fast & educational. If it is read & followed wealth will be achieved.The book has been around for over 70 years & still has a very litle following. The advice is over 3000 years old & still people have no idea about savings & investingPlease keep doing what you have always been doing so you get the same results while those that have read this & follow it's advice will reach their financial goals
4,The Richest Man in Babylon,"If you are busy (like me) and have little time to read the same point told several different ways, then this book becomes difficult although not a hard read. however, if you're like me and toil away 7 days per week yet never make money, you need to make time to read it. The formula for making money is rather simple and basic common sense but some of us just don't seem to get it. This is a good book and I recommend it to anyone with a similar condition as mine."
3,Good Book,When my friend introduce me to this booK I knew it would make me do something about my finances. I understand the concept and did apply it even until now.
2,"Nice, if you like old stories","But only thing you learn is to pay yourself first like 10% and but it away to earn compound interest. Avoid investing in risky things and be patient. Then there is an example how to come out of dept. Live whit 70%, pay away dept 20% and but away still 10% of what you earn."
1,ummmm,"Well...got it out of the box and looked at the back cover, where I immediately noticed that ""classic"" was misspelled as ""claasic"" - ON THE BACK COVER! Then I remembered what another reviewer had said, and promptly sent it back. But I still wanted to read the story, so the 2nd time around I chose the 1989 version by another publisher, which has more beautiful typefaces anyway."
2,What's all the hype about??,"Well, after seeing all of the glowing 4 & 5 star reviews I assumed this would be a worthwhile read. How wrong I was!! The book takes a couple of simple concepts and beats them to death in a series of mind numbing stories written in old English style writing. I struggled to force my way through this less than 100 page book.The entire book basically boils down to pay your bills, save some, make it grow and live on the rest! All of this is conveyed in story form without any real substance or relative guidance. If you're looking for financial advice or guidance, I would recommend looking elsewhere and saving yourself the time of wading through this ""classic""."
4,The Richest Man In Babylon,I was pleased with the condition of the item. It was timely delivered in accordance with the representation from the seller.
2,It's ok,It's taking me a while to get into the book. You need to really focus on this one. It's not like rich dad poor dad where you will want more greed to keep reading it and wonder if he has another book after or before this one.
3,Richest Man in Babylon,This book has some basic principles for increasing your wealth and making sure you don't squander your income. I would recommend it to others.
3,Richest man in Babylon?!?,"Well,I would rather judge this book as a story about one rich man in Babylon than a financial guide sort of book. It doesn't say much, in almost every page you can find ""10% of what I earn is mine to keep"" - well I knew that already and it does work but not in the way the writer put it. I have used the calculator once I've finished this book, and as an average person, I wouldn't be able to put aside more than $20000 for 10 years.20.000 for 10 years??? That's not enough. I am just wandering whether mr.Bill Gates or mr Richard Branson read this book and followed its instructions to become what they are now."
5,THE MOST AMAZING BOOK EVER!!!,This little book is the most AMAZING book I've ever read about building personal wealth realistically.I study it over and over and have probably read it over 10 times and each time I learn something new.I have set my entire budget based on what I've learned in it. The principles DO WORK if you follow them to the letter...:)I give this book as Christmas gifts to my family and friends and would recommend it to any one with an open mind.
5,Eternal Wisdom for just a few dollars!,This is the best book out there on what you need to do to get your financial house in order. I'ver read it twice and have drastically changed my life and net worth. My goals are suddenly attainable and my bills are manageable. You can't afford another day w/o these insights!
1,Bootleg product!!!,"So disappointed in the quality of this book. There are typos even on the cover!!! The font, the typos, the fact that it is not the real book but a reprint of the book -- sorely disappointed."
5,Classic,"This is THE classic book on creating personal wealth.Clason uses the parable of a young man in biblical times who desires to rise from is servant's wage and achieve financial independence. He approaches an older, successful man, and asks for advice. The hero is a bit thick headed, and learns everything the hard way, but eventually he learns and achieves wealth.Clason's advice is simple: Save at least 10% of all you earn. Use this money to invest in things you understand and can control. Never spend your capital, which must be used for further investing. Live on the income your investments create.This is a book you can read over and over.You may also want to read ""Think and Grow Rich"" by Napoleon Hill and ""The 17 Principles of Creating Wealth"" by Phillip Collinsworth."
3,"Great Book, Not so Great eBook Version","I purchased this book several years ago, and read part of it then. The book itself has some great principles and points, all told in a parable-style that is easy to read and relate to. The writing, although 80+ years old, is very readable and the information is timeless.The eBook version of this is not the best. Although priced at only $3.99, the editing is sloppy, with some sentences obviously not written as the author intended. Additionally, the chapters run together, without very good formatting for reading on an ereader.All in all, still a worthwhile purchase, but with a recommendation for the publisher to have it cleaned up."
3,Babylon review,"I found this book to be helpful, but it's told in old english so at times it's hard to understand. Good financial principles to live by, but if I could buy this over again, I would get the updated version."
5,Excellent book. Should be required reading in high school.,"There is a song popular today: You Gotta Be by Desiree. Says: ""read the books your father read"". I wish my father had read and shared this one with me. It is not so common, common sense about accumulating wealth, getting out of debt. Wise investing. An excellent set of rules every wise man lives by to become wealthy."
2,"Work Hard, Save and be rich when you die.","Great reading for fifth graders, if you finished High School or have your GED skip it."
3,The Richest Man in Babylon,"The book is a really good reading if you have a child that has just learnt the alphabet, and you want to make sure he/she won't squander all the money he/she ever gets or earns in the life.The ideas are really good, but if one didn't reach to these ideas untill the teenage period by him/herself it is probably waste of time to put any effort now.Alternatively you can read it in order to relax yourself or a child as it can be considered a fairy-tale."
4,Measured and found wanting..........,"Rev 17:5And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.KJVBabylon had a lot going for it, especially prosperity, however I find that the mighty city did not have God and to me that is a very disapointing issue. I found this book a great resource in proverbs and insights into monetary principles. I measured this book against ""The Greatest Salesman in the World"" and found it wanting. I did pick up a handful of insights and for that I would reccomend the book at fair market value.I believe the Christian would find more information on Godly wealth in Proverbs.~Job 36:1111 If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.KJV"
5,great book,This little book really lays down the basic concepts of disciplined wealth building. A real eye-opener.
5,It speaks to the soul.,In our day of easy credit this book is needed.It's amazing that it was first published solong ago. It really made me think about whatwas important and long term goals. I keepre-reading this book and finding new things.It is one of my all time favorites. Please!Please give it to your teenagers to read.
4,great advice in a story format.,"the financial wisdom of our ancestors encapsulated in a easily accessible story of trials, tribulations, lessons, and blessings. I recommend it for anyone sincere about long term, real wealth."
2,"Good story, poor presentation.","In first place you must know that the size of the letter is between 7 to 9, so it's pretty uncomfortable to be read. Besides, it has some typing mistakes on some words as well as you must know that it's written in old english.The quality of the presentation is very poor, it looks almost like a amateur magazine.The story is very nice and I really advise to read it from elsewhere (maybe buying a more expensive version of the book). I'm going to buy it again but obviously in a different version (presentation).I really don't advise to buy this book but I do advise to buy this story."
5,Simply Great.,"This book, without question, is one of the greatest book on money management and individual financial security that I have ever read.The rules that applied way back then, are still true to this day and the techniques and methods of both saving, investing and advising about money are very real.I would highly recommend this book to everyone, especially to the younger generation, such as myself as we can greatly benefit from it."
5,Should be every teenagers graduation present!,"I regret that I didn't know about this book years ago. I've given it out to at least 17 grads and hope they'll read it before they're 40. The principles are timeless, powerful and inspirational. I've been working at the principles for almost two years and it's better and easier than I imagined."
3,"Not bad, but nothing new.","Not bad read overall. Teaches the same basic principles you will find in most books. If it had been the first financial book I had read, I may have given it 4 stars. Definitely teaches some good lessons for Life, but I think there are better books for learning about Finances and saving."
5,The best $10 you'll ever spend,"This is one of the few books that changed my life (along with the first few chapters of Rich Dad Poor Dad, and, in my personal life, the books Your Erroneous Zones and How to Become an Alpha Male). I won't repeat what others have already said, except to say that having studied finance, I think the advice should really be to save 20% of everything that ever hits your checking account rather than just 10%. The reasons are twofold:1. Taxes on investments. They're much higher today than they were a few generations ago, so we need to invest more to overcome that. (Sorry!)2. The expected return on investments appears to have gone down. Whereas as late as the 1980s it was around 10%, today a lot of academic researchers say it's only around 8%."
3,A Classic to Read Once,"This book is a classic and one that everyone should read once, but I found it's ideas to be too simple and too repetitive to ever deserve a second read... which is my personal idea of a truly great, classic book.Told as a story... a set of parables, I found it to be only mildly entertaining as it slowly revealed it's 10 or so success principles. This book is a short and easy read, yet I still, about halfway through, wanted it to speed up and give me more ""meat"".I guess my main problem with the book, although it does have important, timeless financial information... is that it is not short and easy enough. The ideas one actually walks away with could have been written on one page instead of the 140+ pages used."
5,Money Doesn't Buy Happiness!,"And Happiness most certainly does not buy money - But.. spending a little to read this book can help!! My dad gave me this book to read when I was 12. It was interesting, I understood it, and I still follow the basic principles! The great thing is... it works!!! And even though I haven't spent every last penny keeping up with the Jones', I think I have been pretty happy over the years.Now it's time for my kids to read it :)"
4,Great bang for your buck,"This book is short, very motivating, and an easy read, chock full of good information if you adhere to the principles. My only complaint is that it is a bit difficult to read in the beginning, getting used to the pseudo-ancient speech.Nevertheless, I recommend it to everyone!"
5,"Classic! The ""Must Read"" for everyone. Don't forget to teach its idea to your children.","""A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step""...Confucius (604 BC - 531 BC)And the road to riches and wealth begins with this book. The single disappointment I got from reading this book is that I feel I should have read it since I was young---but I didn't. Anyway, it's not too late to start. Begin with it, then Napoleon Hill's, Thomas J. Stanley's, Dave Ramsey's, David Bach's, and others'."
5,"simple, smart and straightforward","The Richest Man in Babylon is a series of stories set in the ancient city of Babylon, where people of extreme wealth and extreme poverty existed side by side. The reader is a ""fly on the wall"" as those who seek wealth ask the advice of those who have learned how to generate it.George S. Clason has taken several simple money management principles and wrapped them in colorful stories of an ancient culture, which reminds us that financial struggles and the principles of how to escape them are timeless. This book has travelled the years well because the dialogue is already that of another time. The author has cleverly devised a way to show how these principles also apply today.This book will give you a solid foundation for how to handle your money and get it working for you.Larry Hehn, Author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory"
4,Richest Man in Babylon,"Great book, you can read it in an afternoon and the investment lessons are still relevant today. Should be read by everyone from the young person entering the work world, and the lessons are still pertinent to the seasoned investor."
2,Get the original version.,"When I was younger my father gave me the original version of this book and I loved it. It had fascinatingly simple financial advice in an easy to read form. Unfortunately it was misplaced during a move so I chose to buy a replacement.I should not have chosen this version. The talees in this version are identical to the original text, but one tale is completely absent. There are also rampant spelling errors and typos throughout the book (yes I know that it is written in old English or what have you).Bottom Line: Get the original. While this version still has some of the same amazing financial advice, it suffers from typos and is missing an entire tale. Do not get this version."
2,Have ordered several of these in the past... Print quality is down.,"I have ordered many of these in the past. We give them out to all the employees at work. This edition has really bad print. I swear, my old dot matrix printer can do a better job.In all the copies that I got this time, its like the toner was low, and the resolution was bad, because I can see the dots that make up each letter."
4,must read,"Should be read every three years by all that wish to be financial fit!! good read for all, sound advise"
1,The Richest Man in Babylon,"The Richest Man in BabylonthisAlthough the content of the the story is excellent, this particular edition's font is entirely too small and this book has no illustrations.Subsequent to purchasing it from Amazon, I bought another publisher's superior edition through Barnes and Noble, which has an easy to read font and many helpful illustrations."
5,"You'll finish it in a day, but it will stay with you","The Richest Man in BabylonBy George ClasonSeveral of my favorite books are short fable type stories that are packed with golden nuggets of information. Things that most of us have heard before but may have forgotten or never really focused on. In the book, The Richest Man in Babylon, you are very gently reminded of dozens of rules or proverbs and words of wisdom such as:""men of action are favored by the goddess of good luck""""better a little caution than a great regret""""where the determination is, the way can be found""Then there are the:SEVEN CURES FOR A LEAN PURSEand theFIVE LAWS OF GOLDAll of which are delightfully spelled out in a story that takes place in an ancient time and place that is almost magical and forces you to finish the 144 pages in a day or so, but stays with you for weeks or months afterwards.http://www.bloglines.com/blog/KevinKingston"
5,A Must Read,"Essentially it is a book of parables set in ancient Babylon. It teaches all the principles of money management thru the use of parables. As you read the stories you begin to understand good and bad habits in relation to money (spending, lending, budgeting, making bad investments, the importance of saving some of what you earn). For some reason the use of parables helps you grasp the principles. Very enjoyable!"
5,Definate must read of all time,One of the best books I've ever read and I recommend to anyone to anyone starting out or wanting to get their act together.
5,Great for all ages!,"I just finished college and my dad's been helping me get started in mutual funds. He handed me this book (after he'd read it himself) and told me to read it. Worried it was just another dull, on-going investment book, I procrastinated... but when I finally started to read it, I was pleasantly surprised! It's very easy to read, fun, short, and to the point. My dad also made my mom read it, and he's planning on buying more copies to loan out to friends! It's really helped our whole family. If anyone out there is having a hard time getting a friend interested in mutual funds or any type of investing, this point will get the point across! Great deal for the money- and a great stocking stuffer!"
5,The Best book on Basic Finance Principles on the Market.,"This is the best book introducing the ""laws of wealth"" PERIOD. If one can follow the laws of wealth, the consequences of these laws will follow, just like throwing up a ball against gravity. The trick is in being able to follow these laws throughout the storms of life. There are better books that teach the ""hows"" of following these laws, but as a foundation for understanding what these laws are, there is no book of which I am aware better than this one. It has been around far longer than any of the other finance books, has simple truths, is very solid and still going strong. If I could only chose one book on finance and wealth to recommend, this would be it."
5,Powerful and timeless,"I am still amazed that such a tiny book can deliver so much powerful and timeless information. The Richest Man in Bablyon contains the secrets of the ages and is a must read book for anyone who wants financial success.It should be read and reread, over and over."
5,The Richest Man in Babylon,Great book-all should read!Book was in great condition for it's age and transaction was seamless.Thank you!
5,Powerful!!!,I really enjoyed this book... it is hard to believe that it was written in the 1920s. All of the things in this book still hold true today. Although this book was written so long ago all of the tips can be applied to your life today. It really makes you think and makes you want to change the areas that are not right in your life financially. I think everyone should read this book.
5,A better read than Napoleon Hill,"It's interesting, entertaining and good historical read. And very motivational. For that price you get a great time, good mood and motivational power. A worth to buy & re-read also. I can just add one more 5 star. You must have this book just because it's a eternal law of money nature"
5,Everyone Should Read This Book,"""The Richest Man in Babylon"" is a book no contributing member of society should go without reading. I read a chapter a night, and finished each one without feeling overwhelmed by the lessons, or the task ahead of me to regain control of my own wealth. The concepts are easy for anyone to apply to their life, and empower you to improve your financial situation.This is one of the few books I plan to read and reread throughout my life."
4,Common Sense for the Secular Humanist,"This is apparantly a construct of what a wise man from Ancient Babylon would say. It has no Christian principles whatsoever, but secularly would have great wisdom for those with no common sense whatsoever.Take aways:Work HardBe honestBe charitibleBe trustworthyBe loyalHave a good attitudeSave a set portion or what you make and pay yourself firstIt was read audiobook style in Middle English, even though written much later than that period. That made the book just a little bit more stupid. All in all, good life principles. Not bad reinforcement. I gave it 4 stars because it was kind of interesting in style. The content certainly follows what a person with common sense would do."
4,Richest Man in Babylon,"I bought this book and was wondering if ALL of the books are written in the same format, ""thy"" etc? I found it difficult to read. Or do some authors write it in plain english? It resembled some biblical writings."
2,Disappointing,Childish and overly long for the simple lessons it contains. Perhaps suitable for teaching children about money but a waste of time for a serious adult.
3,The Richest Man in Babylon,"A small, fun book, this guide to financial well-being is written as an archaeologist's translation of cuneiform tablets. The ""richest man's"" memoirs take the form of advice to his sons and colleagues. Simple, time-tested rules are easy to remember."
3,Good advice,"I got the CD audiobook version. I found the contents very interesting and instructive. To give financial advice in story form is an excellent idea, and makes it entertaining and easy to understand. Unfortunately - I guess I'm not used to it - therefore found the ""ancient"" language, namely all the ""thee"", ""thou"", ""goest"", ""savest"", etc. terribly stilted and a bit tiresome to listen to after the first twenty minutes or so. I suppose that was how the book was originally written in the 1920's, and is probably easier to adjust to on paper rather than by voice."
4,Easy Read with simple message,"I will keep it simple, the book has simple advice told through lessons in biblical times. However, I enjoyed the book for its simplicity.It has common themes you will find in other ""personal finance"" books. Don't take advice from someone that doesn't know what they aret talking about, such as cattle advice from a mason, etc. Save one tenth of what you earn, work hard, etc.This book is not mind blowing but it is grounding, bringing the reader back to the basics of personal finance and not get rich in 10 mintues nonsense."
5,Excellent book,I'm 20 years old and this book changed the way I looked at money. I've taken the advise and I believe I'm on the road toward financial success. Hope you get your thinking rocked at much as I did.
4,A decent read,"Finished this 150 page ""story"" on a long plane ride from the west. Although this book is set in an ancient time, the guidlines hold true for today's times. The concepts are clear and easy to follow. I'd have rated it 5 stares if it didn't repeat the 1/10 rule over and over."
5,Lifetime Financial Planning,"An excellent book on learning more abt money. This book changed my perception towards money and its laws. Although written in ancient English, but the "" Laws of Acquring Money "" come straight at you. Follow its laws and your road to financial sucess will become more smoother."
5,Everyone Who Handles Money Must Read/Listen to This Book,"Very simple wealth principles are given to follow. It is written in an easy to read story form and the CD is easy listening, putting you there in your mind. Follow the steps given to get out of debt and obtain wealth using what money you already have. I love this book and recommend it to anyone who handles money, pre-teen and up.The Richest Man in Babylon"
5,Not what I expected,"I read the book. It was good. Not something that I had expected from it, but I guess the title says it..it takes place sometime ago where words are used in a Biblical sense. But it gives good ideas about what you need to do to get ""rich"" or gain wealth. Spend nine-tenths, save, loan to accumulate or something like that. I sorta forget. It's an easy read too. There's no homework to it either. Just do what it says and you should be fine, in theory. The tough part is putting it to practical use. I gave it a four because I didn't expect it to be this clear. Ok, so I'll change it to a five. :)"
1,Severely Overrated. Terrible Read. No Great Insights.,"I get it. Save 10% of my earnings, get my money to make money, protect my wealth. Each 'lesson' in this book is the same as the last and the 'insights' aren't that insightful. On top of repeating points, the language in which it is written is barely tolerable. ""The most inspiring book on wealth ever written?!?!"" HA!"
2,Common sense information,I didn't really get much out of this book since what it states is based on common sense and nothing new for personal development in my opinion. There are better books for overall improvement and achievement.
5,Contentment,Fight The Good FightThis book was recommended by my good friend Brandon Osborn. It's a great self-help book on success with contentment.
4,A profound impact,"First, the writing style of this book is somewhat dated. It's told from an ancient Babylon perspective for the most part, while the wording is reminiscent of the King James Bible. This might be offsetting to some people, but that shouldn't stop you from reading it.The content inside is worth a million times the price you pay for the book. For those of you who are already well-off, you will have minimal gains by reading the book, but for the people who live paycheck-to-paycheck, and have trouble accounting for where their money went at the end of the money, this is your book.The prinicples outlined in the book will serve you well in starting to, and continuing to build wealth. The only thing you have to bring to the table is a willingness to apply the knowledge gained from the reading experience"
5,Excellent Book,This is one of my favorite books of all time. I first read this book 8 years ago and the principles are simple and sound. If you follow them they help change your mindset and set you on the right path. I highly recommend this book and love to read it again every new year.
5,THE BOOK THAT CHANGED MY LIFE!!!!,As simplistic as the Laws from this book are; they are exactly what we all need to implement in our lives. If we all followed the stories in this book the world would claim to be the Richest ever. Surprisingly the financial issues we face today are exactly the same issues discussed in this book from 600 BC to present things have not changed much. I've read numerous books but this book through its parables illustrates where we wrong and provide detail guidelines on how to change. Don't just read this book live this book. Sacrifice a year to these laws and see how your life DRAMATICALLY improves. I know mine has.
4,Personal Finance 101,"Keep it simple. Read this book. Here are the basics.money is plentifulfor those who understandthe simple rules of its acquisition1. Start thy purse to fattening2. Control thy expenditures3. Make thy gold multiply4. Guard thy treasures from loss5. Make of thy dwelling a profitable investment6. Insure a future income7. Increase thy ability to earnI felt like it was fate that I read this book. I walked into the bookstore looking for the particular title. I found the librarian, and without even mentioning the name, she handed the book to me. Scary!"
3,Pretty simplistic,"I did not enjoy this book recommended to me by friends in a network marketing group. In fact, I could not even finish it."
5,I give my clients a silver coin,I gave this book to my clients along with a 1oz silver coin and ask them which is more valuable and after reading the book they return the one with the least value. Initially they tell me the $30 coin is worth more but after reading the book they give the coin back and keep the book. Gold or silver doesn't make you rich but how to obtain it and more importantly how to retain it is of the most value.
4,It was a lesson in saving.,This book gave the first rule of saving and then investing the savings. it was in an allegory type style that made it hard to understand in some areas. It also was kind of dry in places.
1,"Great book, terrible print version","I should have read the other 1-star reviews before buying this, but since I had already read the book years ago and loved it, I figured I didn't need to.The version I bought has a burgundy cover with the title in gold letters. It was published in 2011 by Myriad World Publishers. (The original book was published in 1926.)I bought this one to replace the copy I lent to a friend. The typography is TERRIBLE!!!! It's so small I'd need a strong magnifying glass for every page, and it's laid out quite strangely and unattractivly. I agree with what another reviewer said, it looks as if it were just cut-and-paste from somewhere else and never reviewed by a human eye before going to press.Bottom line: DON'T GET THIS VERSION, buy another one that you can actually read. It is a wonderful story, illustrating basic debt and financial principles easily and clearly."
5,A Great Book for your Kids,A very unique book with really unqiue ideas on personal finance. It explains basic rules of financial management through stories and experiences of ancient characters based in Babylon . A book that you will find enlightening and perhaps even given you hope.

5,Required Reading for all to become independently wealthy,"This is the best book I have ever read related to building ones personal wealth.

BUY IT"
4,"Surprised by ""the red priest"".","I'm not a fan of baroque music in general but I was curious to hear what a Vivaldi opera might have to offer. I was pleasantly surprised. This is a majestic score full of interesting harmonies and contrasts between the violent and the gentle. There is one particularly beautiful aria sung by Hippolyta to the accompaniment of two onstage violins; another pleasant surprise. Although the music is on a lofty plane the physical production is something else. In one scene the stage is dominated by several large, broken phallic monuments and Hercules, only partly covered by a lion skin, is unashamedly naked. I had no problem with this but I know from reading other reviews that there is a segment of our puritanical population that might."
3,sparkly crackly Vivaldi,a very interesting performance; lovely voices especially the countertenors and a crisp and crackling orchestral interpretation of a sometimes unusually sombre Vivaldi; the ensembles were electrifying and Zachary Staines's concentration and precision was amazing considering that most of the time he was practically nude which is indeed unusual in opera; it will however not happen too often as it is very very rare to come across a singer with a heroic physique like his! They usually look like marshmallows or barrage balloons.I enjoyed the experience very muchKenneth Zammit Tabona
2,hmmmm.......,"okay, so if there wasn't full frontal nudity and boobies then this would totally not be worth watching at all. i wouldn't presume to tell you whether the problems with hercules' voice is due to the recording or to his own personal vocal limitations (one of his few physical flaws as the video proves), but regardless, any time he sang, i found myself running from the room to get shots of tequila in the hopes of cleansing his nasal tembre from my memory....personally, i'm glad that this dvd is in my library and i suspect many baroque opera fans will enjoy this recording. just don't have high expectations."
1,Not Recommeded,"Who ever heard of a tea pot that in the instructions (who needs instructions for a tea pot?) it tells you right out never to use it on the stove when the flame in on high. Also, it states it will rust if you leave water in it. Well, after less than a year the paint is flaking off in large chips and is absolutley useless. I can not find the receipt (It's a tea kettle, what could go wrong?) If I could I would demand my money back. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!"
2,Cheap Cheap Cheap,"Within the first few uses I found that the paint from the lid was chipping off and ending up inside the kettle. Then after a few more uses the handle was melting, and the bottom paint was chipping off. I was so sad because it's such a cute kettle, but I'm leery to use it now because of all the defaults and also I'm not a fan of eating paint chips."
2,It's okay,"So on day one, my fiancée dropped the tea kettle on the floor. And since day one it has had a chip :(. It is really irritating to take the lid on and off. I also wish I had gotten a whistling tea pot instead. It is a pretty yellow though."
4,"really cute, simple, decorative, yet functional","I love the spark of color it gives to my kitchen. It's the perfect size for a couple cups of tea or to fill my french press--and doesn't take up a lot of stove space. It is light, easy to pour.Cons: If you live in an area with hard water, the inside turns whitish. Sometimes the lid falls off when you pour it all the way to the bottom. The instructions say that parts can rust if you leave water in it [so I don't. And it hasn't rusted]."
2,Chipped... already!?,"Ugh-- I've had the cute little tea kettle for two weeks and there's already a HUGE chip on the lid. Really?! Don't do it, guys. Cheap."
3,A little clumsy to handle,"The only real issue I have with this teapot is that the handle gets hot and even with the lid on you have to use an oven mitt to pour the water b/c of the steam coming out of the top of the pot. I should have considered getting a tea pot with a handle on the side instead of the top.Other than that issue, I like it and it works and it has not caught on fire (yet)."
2,"Very pretty, not to functional, though!","I ordered this around 6 months ago. It looks great on my cooktop!! That's were the raves end, though. It is not dishwasher safe, they say it will rust if water is left in it, etc.My bad, but, I left it on the stove one time and forgot to turn the burner off. It was only about 15 minutes, but, it melted the bottom off on my glass stovetop!! I freaked! I was able to get the mess off of my stove after it cooled with cleaner & a single edged razor blade, but, there now is a spot that I can almost see through on the pot!!! ONE MORE time, if I forget to take off the burner, it will melt all the way through!! VERY DISAPPOINTED!! I had a CorningWear tea kettle that lasted for 25 years!! They still make them, but, the patterns are soooo dated! If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know. I don't like the stainless steel/aluminum ones because they leave a heavy residue if it is a few hours before you make your tea!! Thanks, Debi"
4,Nice little kettle,"Nice kettle. I love the bright color of it. The lid knob is plastic but its fine (looks a bit cheap). Overall, I enjoy using it. Make sure to hold the lid one when pouring."
3,Nice little tespot,Although it is a little too small it does hold more water than I expected. The handle stays cool so you can touch it right after turning off the stove.
4,Works fine,Fine for what it is. Looks nice. NO WHISTLE though. I forgot that I wanted a whistle when I bought this.
1,DON'T BUY THIS TEA KETTLE,"This tea kettle was highly disappointing, and, for me, unusable. Granted it's ""cute"". But, besides not being dish-washer safe, it contains the warning not to leave water resting in it, or it may rust. For the purpose of anyone who wants to have warm water immediately available for boiling, this is unacceptable. Also, the spout had exposed steel, and seemed extremely liable to rusting."
4,Great for apartments,"This is a great teapot for modern apartment life - it's small, stylish, and unobtrusive on a small stove top, but definitely large enough to provide tea if friends are visiting. I like the fact that the spout is flat on top - no dribbling - and I enjoy the large insulated handle. Never had any problems with the handle falling over and ""melting"" on contact with the pot - mine is flexible, certainly, but holds in place after I adjust it. It's also easy for someone like me who is always running all over the place - if I forget to empty the pot, it's okay, b/c the enamel prevents rusting. I own the red, and just bought the yellow for my mom."
1,Fire Hazard,"I can't believe this product is still on the market. As others have mentioned, the handle gets hot and has to be handled with a pot holder. That was the first annoyance.But, that was minor in the scheme of things, because - ironically - I found out within a week that it's not heat-resistant. We put water on to boil, and left the handle too close to the 'down' position, and the handle MELTED. Thank goodness we heard a weird noise in the kitchen and discovered it before it started an actual fire.Don't buy this product. It's that simple."
1,Looks nice but that's about it,"This is not a good teakettle if you need one to use every morning. The inside of the lid on mine started rusting within two days. The lid is also very difficult to put in, causing the paint to chip off into the water, and then causing more rusting. Unless you want to use it for decoration, do not get this one."
5,Fabulous!,I've been hunting for an orange teapot for a long time and am thrilled to have finally found one! Very cute!!
4,Great Look!,"This tea kettle has a great look, just the right size, but I wish it had a gentle whistle."
5,"As a gift, but I want one for me too :)","I got this teapot for my sister as part of what will be her Christmas present. I opened it to make sure that everything was ok and it is so cute. I want one for myself now. And it is the perfect size since she is the only tea drinker in her home. And it arrived in no time. It is reasonably priced and goes great in either a classic, modern or eclectic kitchen :)"
1,OMG,"Why on earth does Amazon have a blackened, scorched & melted image of this teakettle under their product? Not much of a selling point.Looks to be a fairly dangerous product and I decided against it for a birthday gift for my niece!"
2,WHERE IS THE WHISTLE??????,"Idea is perfect ,enamel is one of the healthiest materials for cooking dishes but...lock of whistle is STUPID...also black enamel is STUPID !!!! dirt should be made easy to see not the hardest to see---DO YOU THINK THAT THOSE IDIOTS WHO MADE THIS ONE ARE IN THE WRIGHT BUSINESS??? hell no!!!!VM"
2,PINK POT,"While I was shopping online, there were several colors to chose from in a much lower price. I chose PINK bec it was my fave color, and the price was a bit higher. When it arrived & opened the box, I wasn't satisfied bec there was kinda ""chip"" at the handle. If I would have known, I would have chosen the other colors. It's not worth the price."
3,Cute but best left for decorative purposes,"I was excited about having a cheery, fat, yellow kettle on the stove, so I purchased this one. And yes, it's adorable.And it works, in that it boils water, but it's not terribly well-made. The screw that holds the lid handle on keeps coming loose, and once you're done using it, you must dry it off completely or keep it open. Not only does it rust, but the black paint on the lid comes off on your fingers. I guess some kitchen appliances require more care than others, but it's a kettle, for pete's sake. It's *meant* to hold water.It's also disappointing that you can only set it to boil on medium-low. If I'm in a hurry and require tea, I still use the microwave.My advice is to purchase this one and let it look cute on a shelf in your kitchen, then shell out the $30 or $40 (or more) for a nicer kettle that isn't so wimpy about getting wet. Or about getting hot."
3,"Untrue color, but adequate product","The handle and knob on top of the lid are made of a plastic which contrasts to the shade of the pot itself. This still bothers me, but it boils water just fine."
2,"so badly made, it's not worth it","I bought this despite the bad reviews because it was cute and cheap and matched my kitchen decor exactly. Unfortunately, it is truly poorly made. Every time we heat water in it the kitchen is filled with a melting plastic smell (we only use medium heat). The plastic handle becomes hot, even when in the upright position, and the color of the handle doesn't match the painted body of the kettle. Though a cute design, this kettle does not seem to be a safe way to heat water."
2,Not even a challenge for a 7 year old,"We were so fired up to finally be getting the Shrek Game Boy game. My son has really enjoyed all of his games and has gotten really good at them. But, just imagine my surprise when I saw him with tears streaming down his face after just a few minutes of playing. My first reaction was to remind him that it will take some practice to get better. His response to me was ""It's just a fighting game."" He even had his own ideas of how it could have been better, (ie. more puzzle levels, jumping, ala Mario). I take blame for this one. I didn't read the back of the box. I assumed........and you know...... There are lots of great games out there. Save your money on this one."
2,Mortal Kombat Gone Shrek,"I saw, and loved the movie. I expected this game to be somewhat of an action adventure, with the ability to switch characters and solve puzzles. Picture the image of Shrek being able to belly-bash, and the donkey being able to jump and bray. What I got was basically just a fighting game, ala Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter. The game itself is good, but all you get to do, is play as many different characters and fight best of three rounds. It has special moves to learn, and is a decent fighting game, but nothing more. You just need to take this into account, and if you like that idea, then buy it, if not....it might be good for a rent."
3,An Okay Shrek Fighting Game.,"Shrek: Fairy Tale Freakdown is the first Shrek fighting game, and it was pretty good. You get to play as one of several Shrek 1 characters and make your way through the various levels, beating the snot out of your opponents all the way. This game was okay, but a little too hard and repetitive. Still, you should rent it. It's not quite good enough to buy."
4,Right for my son's flavor for games,I apprecitate the time that it came when I needed it for my son's game device.
1,It is STUPID!,"It is so stupid. I beat the game in 15 mins. I thought is would be cool but it isn't. Don't bother in buying it, it isn't worth the money!"
4,Graphic SF Reader,"A Roman official makes a big mistake. Needing to get Caesar a present, he decides on an invincible Gaul, and choose Cacofonix, because he is easy to capture owing to his solitary walks in the woods. Caesar isn't interested, and decides to throw him to the Lions.Asterix and Obelix have to rescue him, of course, and after playing can't find out how to get into the gladiatorial arena two-step games for a while. They manage it, which is bad for the longevity of the career of the head of the Circus."
4,Well-Made Bike Rack,"Well-made with the option to fold the hooks up against the wall when not in use. The newer model I purchased in store has a new push/pull lever for extra security to keep the rack in the track. I do not see that in the picture here on Amazon. I prefer this rack which grabs the bike frame, instead of the wheels. This rack is great for keeping the bikes off the floor and also making it easier to inflate the tires if you don't have a bike stand."
2,"You buy cheap, you get cheap","Sure, the TV is cheap and works--for the most part. It's just hard to get past the fact that there is an annoying buzzing when something is connected to the yellow video A/V input. The service requires me to drive the new TV an hour away. So for that, it is a hassle. What did I expect for about 100 bucks?"
3,"This hook is okay, but I suggest the 5E11 Multi-purpose hook","This ladder hook is what I expected, but in practice the two-pronged 5E11 Multi-purpose hook is what I use most in my garage. Having the two prongs split opens up options for hanging bags, tools, boots, etc, which would require two of these hooks."
4,Great for step ladders,We hang our ironing board and step ladders from this..although you need 2. Very useful product and well built.
5,Small USB Hub,"Small USB hub. Great for on the go. I bought this to use with a USB OTG setup, so my phone could connect with a hard drive and camera. For me I wanted as small a USB hub that is powered as possible. This works perfectly and am very happy with it. You can see a fuller description of my USB OTG setup by my review for the USB OTG cable:USB 2.0 A Female To Micro Male Adapter Cable (Micro Host Mode OTG ) for Motorola cell phone"
2,Not so great,"This product worked great for about a week. I used it connected to my time capsule with two external hard drives, a printer, and a 1G data stick. After one week the external drives did not work on it. The drives are fine, but the hub will not recognize them.Not worth buying!!!"
4,Would be nice if it was smaller but it works,"What makes this USB different from cheaper USB hubs? Most cheaper USB hubs are not powered, meaning that they don't come with an AC power supply to provide additional power to your USB devices. The cheap, non-powered USB hubs are fine for things like keyboards, mice, etc. but your USB external hard drives need to be plugged into a powered USB hub -- they won't work if you plug it into a non-powered hub.This particular hub from Belkin is affordable and works. I wish it was a little more compact but it is what it is."
3,Belkin USB hub review,"I like the size of the hub and the price, but it lacks power support to USB powered devices. The hub comes with a power supply that is suppose to give the devices connected to it the power they need. I have noticed that my webcam and small business scanner don't work properly when connected to the hub. Flash drives and synchronizing my ipad (not to recharge it) work well. It's a good hub for smaller devices."
3,"USB hub - storage devices OK, others no-go","The Belkin hub performs OK with storage devices, however I tried four different USB cameras; all work on a direct USB connection (using the computers native USB port) NONE of them work with this hub (if I connect the cameras as storage devices I can see the drive, but the cameras FAIL to work AS CAMERAS on this hub). I suspect that this may be true of other ""intelligent"" USB devices but I have not checked."
1,Causes Kernal Panics on my 2011 iMac,"Took me three months of troubleshooting my system to finally figure out I did not have a major internal hardware failure and that this Belkin HUB was causing intermittent Kernal Panics several times a month. Not sure if it is unique to this unit, but the unit works perfectly other than causing kernal panics, even with no devices attached to the hub. Do not believe it is a compatibility issue, but not worth the trouble and cost of shipping to return unit to Belkin to get another unit to try. A lot of frustration and time for a really cheap item."
1,Horrible product does not work!,I used this the day I got it and the devices plugged into it only work intermittantly !I am throwing it in the trash! not worth the trouble to return it!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,ALL BELKIN USB HUBS BURN OUT,Having had several BELKIN USB hubs they ALL HAVE FAILED WITH DEAD PORTS IN A SHORT TIME < 6 months.I bought more than one because my local stores only carry this brand. I would never buy another one but I have been forced to buy these hubs that keep failing.
2,Beware if you use Windows XP SP3!,"I was going nuts. I was using this on a desktop from 2007 that I had kept off the Internet for about two years. Now I wanted networking ability. The computer started installing a couple years of Windows updates. After it installed Service Pack 3, I lost my Belkin USB hub and my Belkin Wireless N connector. They wouldn't work with anything.So I replaced the Wireless N connector with a similar Wireless N unit from another manufacturer. Voila. I'm back on the Net.After Googling around, Belkin devices seem to have problems with XP Service Pack 3, which they have never taken the time to correct. Other manufacturers have no such problems. For example, myD-Link DWA-125 150Mbps Wireless N USB Adapterhas no problems connecting to our office network.So, if you use Windows XP and have Service Pack 3 installed, DON'T buy Belkin products. And shame on them for not publicly declaring that they have elected not to support SP3!"
1,Do not Recommend the Device,"I have a Belkin USB 2.0 4-Port Ultra-Mini Hub (F5U407) and one of the ports does not work with a USB Flash drive, does not recognize it on the one port only. This is on an older PC using Windows Vista. I bought this model which cost about $7 more and, unlike the Belkin USB 2.0 4-Port Ultra-Mini Hub (F5U407), has to be plugged into an electrical outlet. I could not get a USB Flash drive to work on it at all, totally unrecognized on all ports, and had to revert to using the Belkin USB 2.0 4-Port Ultra-Mini Hub(F5U407). The devices that would work on this model ran no faster than previously on the Belkin USB 2.0 4-Port Ultra-Mini Hub(F5U407). Total waste of money. Save yourself some time and trouble and order the Belkin USB 2.0 4-Port Ultra-Mini Hub (F5U407) instead."
1,Doesn't work,"It doesn't run my external HD, Charge my cell phone, or really anything but connect a flash drive. Terrible product IMHO."
4,Awesome,"This is one great ""Hub""...took it out of the box, read the installation instructions, plugged it in and ""It Just Worked"" (first time,with no hassells). I only mention this because I purchased a 7-port hub from another manufacturer ,(D-***k), that I ended up returning. After countless setups and emails to tech support, this unit just did not work. Belkin products are highly recomended!!!"
4,Great product/bad rebate,"I love this product. I had one and then ordered another for a laptop. I am not happy with the rebate that was offered. I sent everything in, and the rebate people are telling me it was an invalid UPC code. I cut the code off the box (yes, I checked thoroughly to be sure it was correct), sent all requirements in and they say it's invalid. I would not ordered this product without the rebate. Now the product is $[...] than when I bought it several weeks ago."
2,Doesn't work with certain devices,"I've had this product for a few weeks now and am finding it doesn't work with many devices, namely my ipod touch and canon rebel. It does work ok for the WD external drive and canon i860 printer. I'm on an '09 iMac.It does free up enough ports for me to connect these other devices directly to the computer, but I'm pretty disappointed that it doesn't work as designed."
1,I HATED IT!,"In short, I HATED this book. But really, that's not fair. I shouldn't say that because even though I was 'forced' to read it for an English class, I never made it through. I think I got about 30 pages into it after maybe a week or two of trying to get involved with it. All to no avail. I hated every minute, and I wish the teacher had never assigned it.I believe that there is a reason the name ""Charles Brockden Brown"" isn't nearly the household name that ""Ernest Hemingway"" or ""Shakespeare"" is."
3,A great American Gothic novel.,"A very deep read. One must place themselve in the time. You will end up asking What, Why, and Who! Take your time and finish it..."
4,Great Gothic!,"I had never heard of Charles Brockden Brown before, until I picked up an anthology entitled _American Gothic Tales_. The excerpt from this novel intrigued and horrified me enough that I had to read the entire story. I wasn't disappointed. Ghosts, mysterious voices that drive completely pleasant, complacent people to do mad things - I read the whole thing in a few hours. His storytelling is reminescent of Poe, although that is incorrect to say, as Brown came first. A shame that no one hears about Brown, as he is definitely a classic.Four stars out of five, because I did not care for the epilogue; it feels a little tacked on."
2,Quality is Lacking,"Within the last month or so, I have ordered many of the Learning Resources Play Food Sets (Breakfast, Healthy Snack, Lunch, Dinner, Bread Basket and Fruits and Vegetables). I was completely disappointed when this one showed up. The quality was not up to the same standards as the others. The paint jobs were shoddy. Both the meatballs and sauce and the fried rice look like piles of vomit. The taco shell was very dark. What pizza has yellow sauce??? It looks like something that should be sold in a dollar store. Very unhappy."
4,Good Food!,As always Learning Resources brings pretend play to life...the only reason I gave this set a 4 star rating? I wish there were 2 of everything...the single shrimp...or single cake...makes it hard to serve up a crowd. (But to be fair i knew this when ordering)...the information that came with the play food is really interesting too...tons of fun facts regarding where each item is served up in the real world and even some recipes to make at home...we plan to use this info to take my daughters imagination to the next level...I would def recommend!
4,Daughter loves it.,"The food items are made of soft plastics, so very little chance of taking out an eye.Food isn't labeled on what it is such as hotdog, red, lettuce, etc. she has a shopping cart and a picnic basket and a table. Plays with it all day long. Will need to teach her the names."
3,Multicultural Foods,"Compared to the other food sets I have, I think this one is definitely lacking. My husband and I commented on how the rice looked like (without being crude) someone got sick. The flan is tiny. The sushi isn't like the sushi that is in their photo, it looks like shrimp and rice. The taco also looks nothing like pictured, it is a brown (what??) shell, black beans, goofy colors...just not at all what I've ever seen a taco look like. The big bun looks like an implant or something. We had no idea what it was until we went through the list of items again. The tamale and wonton also hardly look like the items. They look like plastic painted brown."
2,Very disappointed,"The paint job is horrible, especially the pizza slice. There is an orange color spot on the crust and it is definitely not part of the color scheme. Overall, it is difficult to guess what the food is and the asking price is WAY too expensive. It is cheaply made and the painting job is amazingly sloppy. It reminds me of dog toys but uglier. I usually loves what Learning resources makes and it is not my first play food set, but I definitely NOT recommend this set. Save yourself some money and buy something else."
4,Storm by George R. Stewart,"Very interesting book,although my favorite by this author is still ""The Earth Abides"". This book obviously pre-dates today's doppler radar systems, and deals with the evolving art of weather forecasting. The fact remains that George R. Stewart was a very accomplished writer, and could be counted as a very creative storyteller."
4,A book without characters,"This is a unique book, as there are no real characters other than the storm of the title. The story traces the birth, approach and impact of a storm, and the effect on persons and communities in its path. It is the literary equivalent of the disaster movies of the 1970's and 1980's (presaging them by several decades). Tightly written with the irresistable forward movement of a storm front, it an interesting, and surprisingly educational story. Although a bit dated, weather itself (the main character) has not changed, thus it remains current. Truly a novel novel."
4,pulsating rhythmns,"I don't know a great deal about Turkish music ""but I know what I like."" This pulsating collection of classic tunes from the country that is a bridge between Europe and Asia will have anyone shaking their hips."
3,"The book is great, and the formatting is not bad, but ...","For some reason, even though this book can be used as a textbook, the electronic format does not include page numbers. While this is common within my non-textbook ebooks, it's unusual for my electronic textbooks. It makes it nearly impossible to use in class, especially if the teacher bases assignments off certain pages. I actually had to rent a paper copy of the text so that I could complete my coursework and follow along in class. It's a good book, but if you are purchasing it to use for class, I'd stay away from the electronic version and go with the old-school, paper copy."
3,"Great, but...","Yes, it is an invaluable text for beginners and veterans alike. The Milners leave no stone unturned. However, one would think such a teaching bible, for ELA no less, would be free of typographical and paragraphing errors. Totally unacceptable."
3,So Dry,"The book is absolutely dry...not interesting, and not terribly helpful. Its strategies may be helpful, but I personally needed a translator before I cared about what the Milners said."
1,"Unfortunately, there's a serious problem with this recording","I just received this CD in the mail yesterday. The CD cover art is correct. The CD itself is labelled properly; however, the *music* on the CD is NOT from Edwin Starr, perhaps not even from Motown. The manufacturer really screwed up royally when making this CD. The actual singer is a female vocalist whom I do not recognize, singing songs about her class of students, four of whom are named Jordan. Other songs have little children singing along with the woman vocalist, and while their voices are pleasing enough, I wanted, and thought I had purchased, Edwin Starr singing WAR and TWENTY-FIVE MILES, along with his other hits, not something else entirely. Beware."
3,Going Fewer Places,"The DVD quality was ok, but the content wasn't as good as I had remembered. The character development was sketchy, plotline unfocused. Also, it seemed some scenes had been edited out (i.e. faulty wheel on the stolen car).Interesting to see the young Depardieu and Miou Miou not hard to watch."

4,Shears are Great!,These shears are awesome from a waterfowler's opionion! I really haven't found a use for the knife. Just buy the shears if you are a waterfowler and you'll be happy.
3,Nice rapping okay beats,"There are some great lyrics on here but the beats are kind of wack and you can tells this is a compilation.There are a good collections of MCs and musiscians-Asheru-Wordsworth-Kweli-J Live-Ken Starr...If you are looking for some B-Boy roots music music this could be the place for you.The Top songs are as Follows ""B.M.I.G."",""Braggin rights"",""Backstage"" and ""Mood Swings""Lyrics-10/10 Production-6/10 X Factor-7/10 Classic-8 Replay-7Total=7.5 out of 10 Fingers"
4,Quick and the right price,Reasonably priced and the shipping was fantastic. Just got it so I can't say about the battery life. It did come partially charged. I am ordering another for a spare.
1,its not really a toshiba brand,this battery was totally ripe off. first of all its not toshiba its generic brand and does not last for 30 min.
1,It is the wrong size for the computer,"The exact model number was given, but the battery was still a few millimeters too big for the battery bay."
2,Doesn't hold up.,"This is a very good looking blender, but the rubber teeth that couple with the container and make the unit spin disintegrated on my blender. After checking out repair possibilities, I found that there is no way to replace this small part without taking the unit to a dealer or sending the unit back (a $20 fee). Once the unit is packaged and returned, you are told how much the repair will cost. It seems my best bet is to purchase another blender. This one was not terrific at making smoothies anyway."
1,"Junk, only a one year warranty...","As another reviewer said, our coupling broke after 2 years as well. I called KitchenAid and they wouldn't do ANYTHING b/c it was over a year. She gave me some phone number in Michigan to see if they could service it somehow.If KitchenAid was a better company, they would stand behind their products, especially when the coupling problem seems to be a known issue. I would expect a blender at this price to last at least 5 years. Needless to say, I will not be buying from them again."
1,Kitchen Aid Blender review,This blender doesn't work as well as my old $25 blender for milkshakes. It leaves chunks of ice and frozen fruit that it doesn't chop up. The features are nice and it looks great but it doesn't work very well.
2,Powerful but flawed.,"This blender has a powerful motor that keeps the machine going, but the thick blunt blades aren't adequate for jobs such as pureeing vegetables, fruits etc. It will reduce almost anything to a coarse puree and grinds ice very well. But, the blender leaves more chunks of uncut material than should be the case for one of this price. Running the blender for a longer time doesn't seem to solve this issue.I recently downgraded my review from 3 to 2 stars because after just a couple years of only moderate use the blade coupling broke so the blade won't turn; and KA doesn't sell a replacement. So I'm now in the market for a new blender. It won't be a KitchenAid.Other KA appliances I own (mixer, wall oven, dishwasher) work wonderfully well; this one is a surprising disappointment."
3,Good Bad and Ugly,"After three years, I'm buying a new one. For about a year mine has been throwing grease and I think it's going to buy the farm one of these days.There are way too many buttons on this unit for my use - and the pluse button doesn't always work.Be that as it may, it makes great smoothies, it's easy to take apart and clean, and it is ROCK SOLID so I never worry about it walking across the counter.I think three years is okay and will buy a new one."
2,Disappointment,"We purchased this blender this past summer. It seems to be well made, the motor is powerful, and the controls work well.However, it is NOT the product for the hard use required to make smoothies daily! It does not mix fruit (especially frozen fruit) and liquids well; lumps are always present.The unit is more powerful and better made than comparable Osters or Warings, but the basic container design is flawed. Material does not mix properly always leaving lumpy solids in the bottom, even when the 'chop' button is used for 3 or 4 minutes preceding high speed blending.My second complaint is that the black hard rubber impeller on the base that engages the metal ring attached to the blades seems to be disintegrating leaving increasing amounts of black rubber residue on the bottom of the blender. Overall, this product is a great disappointment"
2,Poor Drive Design,"The drive teeth on the base are made of poor quality material. They snap off when making frozen drinks. I have had three break in exactly the same fashion. Luckily, I still have my trusty Sunbeam blender that cost one quater as much!"
1,Can't Blend - Smokes - Worthless,"Blending seedless canned plums - what could be easier - food sticks under bladeand has to be tediously scraped out over and over. After about thirty seconds itstarts smoking and stinking. Finally it just gave up and started flashing all it's lights at me.I knew KitchenAid was loosing its quality edge and living on reputation only, but didn't realize it had gone this far down the tubes."
1,Very poor design,"Overall this is a good blender, but for the price the connection between the base and the jar is worthless. I have had to replace the connector 3 times and this time just threw it away. I have bought a lot of KitchenAid in the past, I will reconsider in the future. I bought a $24 dollar Osler blender and it works just as well. I can replace it 5 times for the cost of the KitchenAid one."
2,"heavy and powerful, but not very good at blending...","I just returned one of these blenders because I found that while it was built like a tank, it didn't blend very well. When I made smoothies the KA left chunks of fruit and ice under the blades, even when I tried pulsing, all speeds, prayer...the problem seems to be that the blades sit up higher than the bottom of the glass jar, and are made of thick metal, the better to pulverize ice, but my sister-in-law's cheapie blender made a silkier puree..."
2,So-So,This book was so-so. It didn't provide me with any meaningful information. The book written by the author's students is enormously better and heart filling: How to Talk so Kids Will Listen & Listen so Kids Will Talk by Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlich.
4,BOFFO STORY,Good adventure.Stays interesting and makes it seem like your almost one of the characters yourself.Would be a good read for younger folks..
5,Very enjoyable fantasy reading,My husband and I both read Terry Pratchett and enjoy his Disc World series. This one involves the Nac MacFeegle and Tiffany Aching and is just a hoot to read. I love the characters and plan to read every book he writes in this series too.
5,Possibly Pratchett's best,"As a confirmed Disc World addict I have read everything Terry Pratchett has written. This is quite possibly my favorite book of them all. Don't be misled by the ""children's literature"" categorization, it more than holds it own with everything else in the Disc World series."
5,Pratchett at his best,"To me one of the best of Terry Pratchett.It is standalone but it might be even more enjoyable if read after ""The Wee Free Men"".I read them in reverse order and still think it is one of the best.Other tops on my short list:Guards guardsJingoThe fifth elephant"
4,Much better than Wee Free Men,"I've read every single one of Terry Pratchett's books. Wee Free Men was rather dull but A Hat Full of Sky is not only more interesting, it's also much funnier. I'd give it 4.5 stars. You should read Wee Free Men first, but it's definitely inferior to this book."
3,Still worth reading,"This one wasn't as good as the first in this series. The story was not bad, the jokes were ok, and the Nac Mac Feegle are still a hoot, but there was something missing with this one. Some sense of satisfaction that was missing. Perhaps I need to read some other Pratchett books so as not to burn out on one story thread.Don't misunderstand that this was a bad book, I still liked it just not as much as I hoped I would. There are a lot of petty people in this book, which may have been part of the turn-off. I can only deal with so many petty people in a single book and there were an abundance of them."
4,Almost As Good,"This sequel to The Wee Free Men was good but not as good as its prequel.This is a story to tell what happens to Tiffany and the Nacmacfeegle after Tiffany throws the Queen of the fairies out of her world.As she studies to become a witch in the mountains an evil creature that cannot be killed tries to take over her mind and body making her do dreadful things, including finding out what happens to the rest of a person when you turn them into a frog. Luckily the Nacmacfeegle have a plan, or rather a PLN, to save her. Tiffany's mind and soul slowly start turning into the evil inside her. Still, Tiffany does not let the evil take her without a fight. In her mind she hides, trying not to let the evil take all of her and make her the most feared and hated being on the earth. You should read the book and find out what then happens to Tiffany and the Wee Free Men. Sadly, I thought this book, unlike its prequel, had an unsatisfying ending and that is why I only gave it four stars."
3,"Average plot, not too exciting","I've read nearly every Discworld book and this rating is in comparison to other Discworld books. The plot here is OK, straightforward, and not overly exciting. This may be due to this being targeted more toward children. I also find the Nac Mac Feagles annoying to read, however I seem to think of this differently than the other reviewers."
2,Oops.,"Being a Pratchett fan to the hilt, I made haste to get the three books, Hat Full of Sky, Wee Free Men and Wintersmith. I knew they were basically kid's books, but it was Pratchett writing, so how could they be bad?Well folks, I guess anything is possible, even that Pratchett could trip up once in a while. These books all tread flatly into the land of hard-to-go-with-it, a tough order when you have swallowed all the Discworld books whole. The characters are either twee or overdone to the point of yawn. The humour, watered down apparently for children, comes off as stale, there is little logic involved in the plots, and I got really, really sick of Tiffany. Thumbs down, and I hope Terry Pratchett goes back to what he is super good at -- hard rights and up-front lampoons directed at recognizable targets -- and lays off the goody-two shoes stuff.pat chapinhttp://www.ThreeMermaids.com"
2,Disappointed,"My daughter was disappointed in this cookbook due to its lack of enticing recipes as well as its constant use of dairy products in many of the recipes. In fairness, some children may love its simplicity as well as its kids friendly style."
5,"Even if dated, an invaluable travel guide","If you are planning a trip in the United States, this is your book. Most areas of the country are covered. The chief attraction in a region, e.g. Sleeping Bear Sand Dunes, is covered in detail, followed by paragraph-or-so sketches of 15-20 other sites within traveling distance of the main attraction. Good color photos attend the main attraction and some, but not all, of the secondary attractions are also photographed.The book is well-organized and capably written. I have planned numerous trips using this book as a main reference. Had I not had access to the book, my girlfriend and I would have missed a great many interesting, beautiful, and educational places in this great land of ours.Even though the book is now dated a bit, most of the listed attractions are natural ones, and so the age of the book is irrelevant to a great degree. I prize the book highly and strongly suggest its purchase."
2,Need a different cover for Kindle edition,I bought the kindle edition and figured that if the paperback gets a CD maybe the kindle edition would get an mp3 version. Nope. Little bit of a letdown.
2,"Thanks, we know the illness -- how about the cure?","I don't want to sound critical, but it looks like this book is written for a blue-collar Michael Moore-style person who cannot understand why in the world his town is in shambles, and, well, I don't think this book would convince Michael Moore that this is how it is supposed to be. Marina first tells the evident -- that corporations are not that benevolent now as they used to be (well, if you consider their old state as 'benevolence', which is a completely separate discussion, of course) and then tries to prove that this is how it is supposed to be. Well, let see, if somebody has an illness and it is not cured, the person dies. That's natural. But you can try to cure it, right? Not just state that dying is natural? So, where is the cure? Marina does not have it. Suggestions of portable life insurance and more tax dollars for retraining may be a pain killer at some time -- albeit not very powerful -- but hardly a cure."
4,nice...,"this made me wanna go out and buy a dual cd mixer, because I really wanted to ""mix"" this selection... good solid tracks!"
5,Everybody's Got One,"A unique taste in music, that is, let's at least agree on that. How anyone can call this the weakest of the Liquid Sould discography is beyond me. It doesn't really matter. If you like your horn-driven soul with more jazz than rap, more hooks than mindless honking, this is it. The fourth cut ""Everybody's Got One,"" is worth the price of admission alone."
4,Simone makes this album explode,"This is some great funk, first off. I haven't been able to put on this album and stay sitting down yet. It absolutely requires you to respond to the drums and the sax, especially. Dirty MF's opening salvo gets the album rocking and the funkjazz keeps it moving along, but where the entire thing blows up and makes your jaw join your feet on the floor is on ""Dysfunction."" Simone absolutely tears it up with her vocal. If you can resist chanting along...""so I'm smokin agaaain""...see a doctor."
3,Weak,"I've seen Liquid Soul live about 6 times and the rapper Dirty MF is the backbone of the band (even though the sax player, Mars, is running the show). Therefore, I'm confused why Dirty MF only sings on 1 track on the CD. Sorry to say, the CD's a definite disappointment if you've seen 'em live an expect to hear a hip-hop/acid jazz blend. If that's what you're looking for, you should buy Five Fingers of Funk's ""About Time""."
2,Huge disappointment,"After playing MM from the beginning (still have MM1 on sega gensis), MMIX was a huge disappointment from the start. If you love the previous intro's, dont get your hopes up with MMIX...they pan down a banner with stick figures scribbled on it. Also, the character selection was sad with only two options....fighter or magic user. Once started, you will see that inventory screens and equiping items leave a lot to be desired. I will admit that the 3d can be interesting at first but it gets old real quick. As for this new dialogue, it's a pain in the behind and the only thing I can think of to describe it is....cheesy!After eagerly awaiting this newest version, I would of preferred to save my money and re-play a previous version. Call me old fashion but I hope that they return to the old version style and quit trying to fix something that was not broken. I gave it 2 stars just because I am a die-hard M&M; fan and couldn't pull myself to give it only 1 star."
1,THIS IS THE DEATH OF MIGHT AND MAGIC!!,"Why Jon Van Caneghem would put his name to this is anybody's guess. The graphics were created by 3rd graders... I'm not kidding! What can you say about a game that even screws up the fonts? How about the black ocean with clipping errors... The characters are just plain ugly. It is obivious that the graphics, level design, and that incredible opening cinematic couldn't have been created by any real game company. I was struck dumb by how incredibly BAD this product is. Even the install program glitches. The ONLY thing New World Computing did right on this game was the box cover. Very nice box cover.Now for the other reviews on this site that gave this title a 5 star rating: they were certainly planted hoping some fools would like the box cover and remember the quality of gameplay in years past and buy this title... my advice, wait for more real reviews before you waste your money. What a [bad] effort!"
3,well its still M&M which is good but no real improvements,"MM9 has a lot of the features I felt made the MM series good, the skill and character development, numerous quests, diverse monsters, a few good puzzles and a decent main plot. On the down side the motion is choppy, particularly when a town or area first loads and you wish to turn around. The graphics are nothing to write home about, its about 4 years behind the times in that respect. They took out doing alchemy, which I enjoyed, cuts down on the number of skills and made the inventory items boring to look at. Some of the quests are buggy. You have to be careful to save before completeing a quest because the game does not always register a successful completion and then you may be unable to complete the game. It ok but not great. That said its still leagues better than Pool of Radiance."
1,Simply Awful,"As a long time fan of Might and Magic all I can say is what a disappointment! Bad graphics, terrible game introduction, weak character class choices, poor fighting system, weak NPC interaction, blurry fonts that hurt the eyes, can't see hits against monsters, out-dated paper doll style character inventory, poor monster animation particularly during fighting, too few sound cues...The game plays like an early beta or alpha version. It feels clunky and unfinished, even the introduction to the game is uninspiring making you want to uninstall rather then play! One star is too many."
1,Hate the new game engine,"This game literally made me feel sick. I actually really enjoyed the older graphics, it made the game original. The new graphics and game play make me motion sick. What a shame, it was 3DO's last shot before they went belly up :("
3,"Fun, but way too buggy!","As a die hard RPG'er, I'm always looking for new games. The Might and Magic series for the most part, has been an enjoyable experience. MM9 however, was shipped, buggy, and even with the couple of patches that are out there I still have problems. The game itself never left me bored, but way too many problems (crashes) when entering or exiting area's. I highly recommend saving your game with each enter/exit of an area. Aside from that I didn't mind the game, it just would have been more fun with the crash problems fixed either before releasing the game or with patches that fixed the problems."
2,Unbelieveable,"After all the innovations over the past 15 years, Might and Magic still looks the SAME! If you like the game play of Might and Magic, you will enjoy this game, however, I can't seem to get past the fact that the graphics look as though they were created on a Commadore 64. The graphics and type are blocky, like first gen games.. for those at 3D0, PLEASE PLEASE invest in a new engine that isn't 10 years behind your compitition!!"
1,what's going on?,"I've had to come online to double check I had the right game - I thought maybe I'd learnt my roman numerals wrong or this was a counterfit version - I say this because when I started playing this game I immediately thought OH no, I've got the earliest version of MM not the latest!! I loved MM6 and 7, the inventory was great and the graphics while not the flashest were enjoyable, and the layout easy to use, like mixing potions and using the maps. This game is seriously limited - it's like everything you could do has been taken away. On top of that it glitches out left right and center. I'm bummed, I was looking forward to getting stuck into a new game and I've been landed with this budget junk. You'd be better off to drag out the old MM games and play them than put time and moneyt into this."
1,"Buy a ""professional"" model instead!","Rather than buying a $110 clipper that is not what the professionals use, why not buy an Oster A-5 1 speed for about $95? You don't have to unscrew the blade every time you have to change it, and they can be sharpened many, many times. Ask your local groomer or veterinarian what type of clipper they use. You'll find that none of them use one of these crappy(but costly)clippers. Ask them how many times they can have THEIR blades sharpened!"
4,An album full of 90's dance-rhythm melded with 80's top hits,"You may have heard her music at dance clubs, as several titles have made the Top-50 club playlists.Even if you don't know who performed the original hits (a friend told me one was originally by Dr. Hook... who the heck is Dr. Hook???), you'll love this music; it's the perfect fusion of dance and tried-and-true 80's top hits. Yes, it sounds like all synth's and a drum kit... real drums would have sounded better on some tracks.If the rhythm doesn't get to you, the lead singer's (Tina Savoie) talented and sweet voice will.A few of the tracks, such as Heart's ""What About Love,"" really should have been left alone.Overall, an excellent must-hear album! Hopefully, she will come out with a second - remixes or not."
5,Fun opposites book,This is a cute way to learn opposites. The pictures are large and colorful. My 3 yr old loves the book and my baby likes the pictures.
4,book,"This book is special for kids, to my son he like the dinosaur book, no required supervised by an adult is very strong."
4,"A fun book, good words and rhyming!","This is a great book for early reading and for fun time with the kids! My son loves it, while my daughter only likes it. It is fun to read with lots of sounds and a variety of ""roars"".The graphics are colorful and nice with colorful dinosaurs that and smile a lot, and not scary - dinosaurs can easily go over the ""top"" and get scary for kids if not done right. The words are few, and go well together with quick rhyming and therefore good for early reading.Most of all, it is fun! My son is now almost 4 and still pulls this book out and still has a lot of fun while we read it. Your results may vary, because I'm a good ""roarer""!"
5,This book is awesome for little ones as well as adults.,What a cute way to show little ones how to compare different things. Words are printed big enough and rhyme just right to help a child learn to read. Really brought a smile to my face.
3,Nothing really special,"This book is well illustrated, but the rhymes dont really rhyme that well, and the flow of the book with the child is not really that natural. There has gotta be better dinosaur books out there."
5,A Great Little Book,"This is a small board book that features some nifty dinosaur illustrations accompanied by some simple rhymes. This book has quickly become my 2-year old son's favorite book, and he carries it around the house and always wants us to read it to him."
5,Perfect at 2 and 3 years old.,"I can't speak for 4 year olds yet, but my 3 year old LOVES this book and he loved it when he was 2 years old too. He especially likes the dinos that look like they're smiling -- ""happy dinos"" he calls 'em. It's a good vocabulary builder too with lots of antonyms (strong, weak; fast, slow; clean, slimy; fierce, meek; etc.)"
5,First and still favorite book of my three year old boy,"While the language in this book is a bit simplistic, the illustrations and layout are great. My son instantly fell in love with this book when he got it for his second birthday and now that he is three he still wants to bring it to school with him sometimes. In fact this is the first book that my son ever learned any new words from. He still quotes from it all the time. If you have a dinosaur lover, give his this book"
3,Little dissapointed.,"The pictures in this book are as colorful and bright as you expect from the Sticklands, but it isn't nearly as fun to read and reread as ""Ten Terrible Dinosaurs"". It's a book of opposites, and does have some different word choices than most opposites books but it wouldn't be my first recommendation of the Stickland's books."
4,interesting read,"Book grabs your attention from the start. Enjoyed reading it, but some parts were slow. I love biography books so this one was enjoyable"
5,Could Not lay this book down,This book is very intriguing because it is based on a real life story of a woman who thought that she was weakbut found incredible strength in God.It highlights the Mercy of God even in the worst of circumstances.
3,Poorly Written,"Interesting story, too much focus on death. Too much dwelling on her thoughts and it becomes boringpc"
5,incredible,You will be inspired by this true story. It will bring tears to your eyes. Very humbling. Puts life into eternal perspective.
1,Do not make the mistake I made,Please do not waste your money in this rail. I will need to buy a new one because this one doesn't fit comfortably on the bed. My 2 year old girl always ends-up with her feet stuck between the matress and the rail.
1,save yourself the hassle,"First one we bought was missing pieces and the second one has a ""hinge"" that is not safe. Buy from another company. Poor instructions and poor quality product."
3,Ok,"It arrived in a squashed box, one piece broken. But, we were doing it with our son, getting him excited so we couldn't send back. It's fine, but not for a sleigh bed (our mistake!). Easy to change sheets as other reviews said. Hope it holds up!"
2,Long,"It was ok except way to long - did not realize it would be that long. I wish I would have read that it ws so long, I need to try and modify it - I threw the box away that it came in, so I guess I'm stuck with it. The product is made nice and it is my problem."
2,regalo extra long hide away bed rail,"This seemed to be a great bed rail for my son who is 2. I bought it so he could not fall of the bed and yes its long enough but not long enough to protect him from falling. Prior to buying this one I had bought the normal regular hide away bed rail and its just got bent. The quality of the metal is not good. when installing them the metals got bent and the pins that make the bed rail come down don't work to great. It does protect the baby from not falling, but the quality of the metal is not that great."
3,may have been used before,"when i finally recieved the regalo bed rail it looked as if the origional boxing had been retaped, and the product inside also looked as if some pieces were a little worn such as a couple of the poles and one of the straps i am definitly keeping this product though because it took forever to get here and i do not feel like waiting for another but all in all it does the job right"
4,Good product but does not seem to sturdy,"The bed rail serves it purpose. We have a 6 month old that likes to sleep with us. She likes playing the rail, but it serves it purpose because we were concerned she would roll off the bed. It slides under between the mattress and the box spring. The only concern is that if you open and close the bed rail, you get the feeling that the spring loaded latch may break.Otherwise I would recommend."
4,Child Bed Rail,"The bed rail works well. It was easy to install and easy to remove. Sliding the side under the mattress is not as easy as they make it sound though and I have stopped using it; maybe that only works well if the bed has a box spring at the bottom and not an actual frame insert with slates. Nonetheless, it does its job and keeps my child from falling out of bed."
1,Hide Away that doesn't hide away,"Good design idea but product materials too cheap to work. The metal discs that allows this rail to slide/hide away easily become dislodged, slide unevenly and eventually bends which makes it impossible to slip between under the mattress.As a Gramma I wanted to use 2 (one on each side of the bed) on my one guest bed that is used by both adults and grandchildren. Without it sliding under the bed and just hanging down, it was impossible for adults to access the bed because the gate hangs down at a large angle.It was worth the money I lost in shipping charges, both receiving and returning, this product because it rendered the bed useless by both toddlers and adults.I will look locally before buying another bed rail."
4,Pretty good,"This rail worked well for a while..but my 3 year old daughter broke it since where 2 metal rods meet at top is pretty weak. I guess there would be no way to make it stronger, but I was just frustrated that it completely broke after a few months. Also seems like it took a really long time to put together. But it did work well while it was up!"
4,REgalo Hide Away Bed Rail,THe bed rail is sexactly what was needed for my grandson's move from the crib. IT fits great on hi bed and even when he rolls into it while asleep holds in place. I would recommend this for anyone moving a child from the crib to a twin size bed.
3,It's OK.,"I bought this for my toddler girl as she tends to kick the shared wall every night. After installing and using this product, the kick has mostly stopped. However, this will make the bed incline or higher on the rail side so your child will roll towards the opposite side of the bed making them prone to fall off on the other side. I think they designed it to be like this so that you would have to buy two of it."
1,Zero stars!!,I bought this for my 3 year old daughter. She is not overly rambunctious or anything and is very gentle with her bed. The pieces started to bend and break and then it fell on top of her one day while she was playing on the floor of her room. We were lucky she was not seriously hurt. It is JUNK.
1,15 month old broke it in one night,"It took me an hour to put this product together. After it was all put together, it felt and looked flimsy. I affixed it to my 15 month's old twin bed and he managed to push the rail down and take it apart in one night.It doesn't fit flushly with the mattress and I couldn't figure out how to make it bed to tuck it between his mattress. I threw it away. Very disappointed in the product. I hardly write reviews, but I had to write about how cheaply made this product was."
2,Not the newest model,"I bought this and the additional side rail, both from Amazon, both the extra-long version. The additional side rail is regalo model number 5020AX and the hide away bed rail is regalo model number 5010HD. These are not compatable. The problem is that the hideaway bed rail is the old model and the additional side rail is the new model. Despite the instructions on 5010HD indicating an anchoring tube with removable black caps (so the additional side rail can be added), there are no black caps and there is no compatability. I recommend paying a bit more and just ordering from One Step Ahead. I am stuck with these two products that I don't feel like taking apart and shipping back, and will probably spend two additional hours attaching them. To do this you need metal drill bits, nuts, bolts, and a retired father in law. Two stars only because the actual product seems pretty good. Regalo customer service is useless and not helpful, dont bother with them."
2,Had to return,We bought this rail to help our son transition to his new big boy bed. Sadly it did not list in the description that it is not recommended and should not be used on platform beds.
4,Keeps your child safel in bed,"Instruction sheet a little complicated. Once put together, rail fits nicely under the mattress and hides away until use. When the bed is made up you can't see it. Folds out easily for use. It is nice and sturdy and keeps our grandkids safe in their beds when they spend the night. Love it. We actually bought two."
2,Regalo Extra Long Bed Rail,"I ordered two. The problem I experienced is attaching the netting part to the rail. It is way too tight. The zippers broke when we tried to zip up the panel. It needs to be wider (by at least 1""). I understand the manufacturer needs the netting to be tight, but when you literally cannot zip it up (two people trying) because it is too tight a fit, there is something wrong."
1,Not easy to use,"This was easy to put together, but horrible to use. It doesn't fit well in our bed, one of the clips came broken and one of the pins is jammed. Big mess and I just put it in today. Look for something else."
5,Okay,The rail was nice but one of the locking pins was damaged. We bent it back in place and it works now. I didn't want to go through the hassle of exchanging it.
4,Nice Fence with annoying stickers,The fence is great in that it is solidly built and holds the kids well. Even when pushed the hook did not release. It would have been a 5 if not for all the stickers labeling the parts. They are the worst to remove and require goo-be-gone. Placing the fence under the bed is not that easy (not hard either) but I do not it anyways so not a bid deal for me. You end up removing the fence anyways as you need to lift the mattress. Putting back in place is easiest with 2 but not hard with one. Overall it does an excellent job of holding the kid back from falling and for the price it is a good product.
4,Perfect bed rail for toddlers,"Grandson (2.5) year old was visiting for a few weeks. The rail was perfect for this situation and would be good as a permanent installation for parents of toddlers. It is sturdy, ""fairly"" easy to install (no tools needed, but instructions are not completely intuitive), and hides away under the mattress when not in use. Very reasonable price through Amazon. I would recommend it."
1,Would not recommend,"This bed rail took an hour to put together, directions were ambiguous, and when we finally got it assembled, we discovered one of the sliding rails was bent and the side came out everytime we tried to put the rail up or down. Will not be buying one of these again."
1,Not as good. Invest more money,It fits into our 18months baby bed but after 30 days the structure bend and never work again. Very disappointing. I have one from other brand and had almost 02 years and works perfect.
2,"Big, Bulky, does not work with any frame","Bought two of these as our daughters bed comes out from the wall not against it. Forget using two as the way the rails are you can not put two of these on a bed. The rails below are very bulky and angle the bed/put large lumps. The idea of the rails being hidden is great however if your kids bed sits in any frame that covers even the tiniest part of the mattress forget this function. Incredibly disappointed, it gets two stars as it is made in a bombproof manner but that is the only reason it even gets 2 stars."
2,Pain,This bed rail slides under matress so it make the matress un-even and my child rolls into the wall. It is also a VERY big pain to un-latch it and slide it under the matress and then pull it back out. Wouldn't recommend it.
1,Cheap,"From the moment I assembled and installed this bed rail, it felt flimsy. I'd purchased a foldaway rail thinking it would make it easier to make my daughter's bed, but was wrong. The rail was so difficult to fold under that it wasn't worth folding it away; I'd just pull the bed away from the wall instead. Any attempt at folding it down would result in the cheap metal ""wheels"" that guide the rail popping off the cheap metal track. In less than six months, my two year old daughter had the rail bent and finally snapped the cheap ""wheel"" right off the rail itself. Despite installing it correctly, my daughter would still manage to push it away from the bed enough that she could have fallen through. This thing just ended up in the trash, what a waste of money.Save yourself the headache. If you have to have a safety rail, just get a rail that is solid and doesn't fold away or purchase a less expensive bolster that fits under the sheets. This one is crap."
3,Can only use on 1 side of bed,"This item works well but can only be used on one side of the bed. Our daughter's bed is not against a wall so we bought two rails, but they are not designed to be used together. The rail goes under the mattress but the bars go all the way across to the other side, and staggering the rails is not possible. We are still using both together but one railing leaves a 6"" gap between itself and the mattress. We still use it because the gap is not big enough to cause an issue."
5,Great bed rail!,We are so happy that we have this bed rail! The length is perfect. It is the longest bed rail we have seen on the market. We use the HideAway feature often. A very safe and sturdy bed rail.
3,I got it for my grandson's visits.,I got this for when my small grandson's visit. I put one on each side so they won't roll out of bed. It conveniently stick between the mattress when not in use. It saves having a crib in the room which is not used that often.
4,Keeps our Boy in Bed,"Our boy is big enough to shake this pretty good and he's 16 months. I'm a little concerned that it's a little loose, but it keeps him in bed at night."
2,flimsy akward to use,Doesn't stay flush to mattress or square in the track making it very hard to fold away. It's too hard to attend to my toddler in low lighting at night. Can't recommend this product.
1,Bed Rail for children,"I am looking to the ad I saw when I purchased this bed Rail. The instructions tells me ""This bed rail is intended for use for children 2 to 5 years of age."" I had asked for a bed rail for senior and this was listed. Also, one piece of the rail broke. I cannot return as I dont have the box, but I will call the company I will throw it away. They cannot send me the replacement rod.BED GUARD RAIL"
2,This is a piece of junk,"This bed rail is a piece of junk, dont waste your money. It DOES NOT come with a travel bag like it says in the item description."
4,Very Pleased!,"I needed the extralong sides, so I installed one on each side of the bed and they work great! I didn't give it 5 stars because I couldn't get the extra long in a pre-made double sided style."
2,I am sorry I bought this,"This is a great idea, and maybe it's the type of bed we have for our son? but this did not work at all and ended up just being a source of frustration. We have a twin bed from IKEA that has 4 posters and flips upsidedown for a ""bunk"" bed when he's older. It was NOT easy to put this rail up and down, and when you're trying to mess around with it after your toddler is in bed it certainly doesn't help them go to sleep! One side of ours just didn't click in easily, and pulling it in and out was also a hassle. Now I'm going to have to buy something else."
3,Functional but cheaply made,"It works right now, so I'm going to keep using it. The hideaway feature is not very functional though, especially with a heavy adult mattress. Feels like the mechanics will break when you shove it in to hide it. I'm using it for co-sleeping with my toddler. My problem is with the latch locking system. It is very clumsy and the metal around the latch is thin and cheap. It will break one day that is for sure. The metal around the latch is easily bent and the hole where the locking peg goes through had to be made wider with a screwdriver to get the locking peg in there. Forget about being in bed with a sleeping toddler and gently raising the side to lock into place---WILL NEVER HAPPEN. inevitably spend a few minutes fumbling with the latch to get it to lock, or have your partner do it from outside the bed. If using this for a kids bed, I wouldn't have a kid over 40 lbs using it."
2,Harder than it looks.,"This rail was much harder to work than it looked on the video. We could not get it to slide under the mattress and when it finally did it was difficult to get it back out. Plus, you could feel the rails under the mattress when you laid down. Had to return it to Amazon."
5,Rigalo bed rail,Goods item! my 2 year old boy is special needs & it keeps him safe in bed great! it was extra long and sturdy so it works well
3,Wish it was better,"A pain to put together....it sucks that you pay full price for a product but have to do all the work to put it together. So many pieces to this, was easy to do but cumbersome. This product does hide away well but the hinge area is going to damage the mattress without a doubt as it's bulky. Latches are not perfect each one causes me issue each time we use it. But it does work eventually and provides safety as it's supposed to once all is in place."
2,would not recommend,"I would not recommend this item to others. It was fairly complicated to put together, the pieces looked scratched when I first opened it and the biggest drawback is that the safety bars that hold the rail from under the bed are very short and turn all the time. If you really tighten the straps to hold the rail on they just turn and slide right under. We also noticed that one of the pieces looked bent. We thought we did it by accident while putting it together but after reading numerous reviews it seems others also had the same problem. My daughter has not slept in the bed with it yet so maybe it works fine, but I definitelty feel dissappointed with the quality and construction so far. Also, not as important but still good to know, our bed does not look cute and made with the rail on. You really need to slide the rail under and make the bed that way. Not easy in our daughters small room."
2,Wish I'd bought something else,"After much research I bought this bedrail for our 2 1/2-year-old. I was very disappointed. I purchased this model because it seemed to be the only one that didn't have bulky rails under the mattress that would ruin the mattress and box springs. The product is very misleading in that respect. It has even bulkier rails than other models that fit 4-5 inches under the mattress (and they have sharp points that will tear holes in the box springs in no time), then the strap, then these worthless L-shaped bars on the other side that always turn sideways. Forget about trying to make the bed. An everyday chore has become an everyday nightmare. The rail is much harder to fold down than other models and those dang L-shaped things always come off every time you tuck the sheet. I haven't tried the foldaway thing, but it's not really a feature I need. I just want to make the bed. I purchased mine for $30 from Target, but still didn't get a good buy for my money."
3,Does not work for extra thick Mattresses,"The Regalo HA Extra Long was easy to install. Each piece was numbered and the instructions were clear. This is why I give it three stars. However, it was not high enough for my mattress. My child could easily roll off the bed. Unfortunately I will have to return it. Is there a safety rail out there that fits todays extra thick mattresses?"
5,Great Bed Rail!!,"I purchased two of these bed rails for my toddler son when we switched him from his crib to his full size bed. The directions were a little unclear at one point and the first rail took me about an hour to put together, but once I figured out what I was doing wrong the second rail only took 5 minutes to put together. The hardest part was putting both rails on the same bed. Now that they are both on there I have no problem changing his sheets (I don't even fold them down I just shove my hand down between the rail and the mattress and then make sure the rail straps are snug and secure). I would definitely recommend these bed rails."
4,good product,"This works on a standard bed, but not on a camper overhead bunk due to the thickness of the rails under a very thin mattress."
2,Regalo Bed rail,Manual is written poorly with too many steps that do not showthe best way to position pieces to put the rail together properly.One of the spring locking pegs on the side rails was broken and would not click into place after I put to bar pieces together. The release mechanism to lowerthe gate is poorly designed and not very sturdy physically. Pullingout the spring loaded pins is difficult and putting them backafter raising the gate is even more difficult. I would avoid gettingthis item if I had to purchase it again.Regalo Hide Away Exrta Long Bed Rail - White
2,"OK, but there are better","I bought Dex Universal Ultra rails for my daughter and they're the best. However, the price increased almost 100% in a year so when I had to buy rails for my son, I decided to try this one. It's inferior. The rails are very bulky under the mattress and lift the mattress up about 1/2 an inch. They also risk ripping the bedskirt and mattress cover if you pull the rails. Although the Dex rails are 2x the price (frustrating) - they are considerably better."
1,Very Heavy and difficult to handle,"The instructions of how to samble it were really bad, the product has a good size, but is very heavy, I tought was a good product because was made to hide under the matress but it is a total lie, since it is too heave it is very difficult to hide away. I returned it inmediatly, I am glad I dindn't buy trough Amazon because I would have to loose the shipment moneey."
4,Does what it is intended to do,We purchased this extra long bed rail for our son as he transitioned to a twin bed. The instructions were ok. I found that some portions were vague like most instructions.Pros: its length is great so I don't have to worry about our son falling out.Cons: it is not the best construction overall so be aware. Our son loves to jump and do somersaults on his bed and has bent it slightly. Making the bed it a challenge if you don't collapse it.Overall I would recommend this product though
4,Very Pleased,"I was looking for something for the transition for my 2 1/2 year old grandson to a big bed. It was easy to assemble and I liked the fact that it was longer. We leave it up all the time, and he climbs out the end of the bed easy enough. Very sturdy, and we only use it under a twin mattress, no boxspring. Definetly recommend it."
2,really frustrating,"the only reason this item got 2 stars instead of one (or none) is that putting it together was pretty easy...UNTIL the mesh covering on mine is somehow sewn wrong- it is too tight to stretch over the poles, making it impossible to finish assembling it. i called the company and they told me that since each mesh cover is sewn by hand, it could be that the one i received wasnt sewn large enough. i just love how the wording in the instructions is ""SLIP the poles through..."" when i'm sitting there trying with all my might to stretch them and its literally impossible. the customer service rep told me they would send me a new peice of mesh cloth.... we'll see if its any better."
3,"It works, just wish it wasn't so cheaply made","This is perfectly fine bed rail. I like that it is longer, for added security, but it is so cheaply made its disappointing. I guess you get what you pay for. I would most likely buy this again, even though, brand new just out of the box, it was bent and I am not sure how long the fabric will last."
4,"Good length, Ok fit","This was the longest bed rail I could find for my 20 month old. The quality seems fine & I like the mesh so that my toddler can still breath if she has her face pressed up against it. The only negative or annoying thing for me is that the way this contraption sits in between mattresses, it makes the side where the rail is higher than the other side, so the top mattress ends up being at a bit of an angle. Ours is installed tight so that the rail doesn't move, but I don't think loosening would make a difference & I don't know if this would happen with other brands. I don't use the fold & tuck feature much but in order to use it you must adjust something on each side which I can't reach on my own, so I do one side & my husband the other. I only use this feature when I change the sheets. I am very happy with the length of this on our twin bed. It covers more than 3/4 of the mattress."
2,Very Difficult to breakdown for Hide Away Feature,"I'm not at all impressed with this purchase. The rail is incredibly difficult to breakdown for hideaway storage. We bought it for my 22 month old son who now sleeps in a twin bunk bed with his sister. While it was incredibly easy to assemble and is in fact pretty sturdy, the locking and unlocking mechanism is cumbersome to say the least. Not only do you have to individually unlock each side, you have to rotate and spin, wiggle it a little, and push down the rail all at once. Also we've noticed that using the hide away feature it scrapes the side of the wood framed bunk bed! While I don't have anything to compare this item too, I think I will begin searching for something that works better."
3,I would say just ok,"I put this together in about 20 minutes. Over all I am not very impressed with the quality of the product, but I don't have anything else like it to compare it to.It has managed to keep my son in the bed though so it does work. I would recommend that you monitor your child sleeping the first night or two. My son is is a wild sleeper, and very restles when he first gets in the bed. He has soon how managed to get his foot stock several times inbetween the safety net and the down bars."
2,didn't last long,"I like the look of this, but I purchased it on April 7 and today is 12/9 and it is down and broken. Hubby built a wood one. My granddaughter is blind so she must have a rail right now, she pulls on it sometimes so for her it was not built sturdy enough at all, and it also put a hole in the brand new box spring."
2,Rails falls,After several months if use the metal/plastic tabs wear and will not hold the rail up. We've had to replace after using for about 4 months.
5,Very pleased!!,My daughter just graduated to a big girl bed so I needed the extra security and piece of mind. This product did the trick. It is very sturdy and long enough that I don't have to worry about her falling off the bed. I placed the net closer to the headboard to make no gaps at the head of the bed where she sleeps. Very happy with this bed rail.
4,Nice,We have used this bed rail for a few nights and it seems to work fine. Was a little difficult to assemble alone just due to its awkwardness. It sticks a little when I try to slide it under the mattress to change the sheets.
3,Pain in the but for traveling with...,a bit of a production to use when you always have to put it together.I can imagine it's fine for a home bed that doesn't require moving it.
1,"poorly designed, cheaply manufactured","the cheap metal zipper broke away from the cover while trying to put this product together. Overall it appears cheaply made and not worth the reasonable appearing cost. I am in the process of trying to return it, but you cannot return it direct back to amazon and must go throught the returns center and wait for a response from the manufacturer."
2,boring,"just.plain.boring, not what i was expecting. Kaidan was more of a tale of obsession, then any kind of horror or haunting. It was painful to sit through. It was visually beautiful, however, if one is looking for a horror movie, please search FAR from here."
3,Fascinating,"I'm not familiar with Japanese ghost stories, but found this movie to be very fascinating. There were few times during the movie where I felt the story could be tightened up (I wasn't sure if I was missing something due to cultural differences) to make it flow a bit better, but overall it was very compelling.This film was a great introduction to this genre."
2,Unconvincing!,"In the orient, the purpose of ghost story telling is to remind those that are living to abide by their conscience and morals. I haven't seen the original movie that were made in the fifties. In this remake, there were just far too many people that got killed at the end that had nothing to do with the protagonist or the curse (like in Jun-On and the Ring saga), thus making the plot rather unconvincing! Watch the Japanese horror classics such as Kwaidan, Tales of Ugetsu, and Portrait of Hell, and you shall know what I mean."
4,This is a riveting book comparable to Clive Barker or King.,This is a riveting book comparable to a Clive Barkeror Stephen King story.There are many guessing games thrown at the readeras you try to imagine whether this is a werewolf storyor if it is just a deranged maniac on the loose.The horror scenes are some of the most shockingthat I have encountered.I would recommend this book to anyone that enjoyscourting the possibility of nightmares and sleepless nights.Not for the squeamish.
2,I'm almost ashamed to admit I read the whole book.,"The writing in this book was so poor, I felt as if I was reading a parody of some sort. Like a 'How Not To Write Horror' manual. I'm not entirely sure why I finished the book. I had some hope that it would improve, and it was also so ludicrous that I had to find out how bad it could get.The characters were cheesy and two dimensional, the plot was predictable and often silly.I also got the impression that Mr. Stine was desperate to drive into readers' heads that this is NOT a young adult novel. I think he went overboard with descriptions of sex scenes and foul language. I'm not a prude, but I think his attempt to make this story adult was overkill.I'm disappointed but not terribly surprised because it's so difficult to find really good horror writing."
2,But I love Fear Street!,"Maybe I opened this book with too high of expectations. I love the Fear Street series, have since I was a kid. I may have a BA in English, bu I still love to read these during TV comerials and smoke breaks. Anyways, to make a too long story short, I HATED this book. I didn't connect with any of the characters, and the plot left too many gaping holes. Also, while trying to please ""adults"" Stine left all of his charm on the cutting room floor. I only spent .50 on this at a garage sale, yet I still feel I was ripped off. The only reason I gave this terrible book 2 stars is beacause the idea was original, and I still love the Fear St. books."
1,a major disappointment,"Not having read Stine's teen books, I was looking forward to this book as a good read for Halloween. It wasn't. The plotting and writing were like a first draft. A lot of it didn't make sense. I gave it one star only because the sex scenes were (unintentionally) very funny."
1,This man needs to take a writing course!,"Mr. Stine's story is tolerable if you can get past the writing. I can't believe so many people gave it 4 or 5 stars. Does he really believe that people say ""huh"" as many times as he uses it? His style put me off totally from the story."
4,"Superstitious (R.L. Stine, Gossebumps, Fear Street)","My favorite book, indeed. R.L. Stine sure did it. He created a story with great skill and tons of suspense. It'll keep you guessing. The book was so good, I couldn't put it down. It was practically glued to my hands! You'd never expect R.L. Stine to write such a magnificent book."
5,YOU HAVE TO READ IT,"IF YOUR AN ADULT WHO IS SICK AND TIRED OF READING NON - SENSE YOU BETTER GET THIS BOOK. IT WILL KEEP YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR BED, YOU NEVER WHAT WILL HAPPEN DURING THE COURSE OF THAT BOOK. R.L. STINE PROVED THAT HE IS JUST NOT A CHILD WRITER, THAT HE IS AN ADULT WRITER WHO WRITES WITH PERFECTION!!!!"
3,Has a lot of problems,"Superstitious is one of R.L. Stein's few adult books and its not that great. The book follows all the cliches that are in any of his Fear Street novels. (Mysterious boyfriend, supporting best friend, annoying side characters) and it even follows the same plot as most of his other books. Superstitious isn't really a bad book, but its predictable most of the time. However the book did keep my interest and it was a page turner."
3,"Great Plot, bad solution of an ending","The plot of the story is great actually, it is well written, just the style of his writing leads you to turn page after page.I was extremely unsatisfied with the ending however. The resolution was horribly thought up of. It built up so many questions and tensions through my head. But when the questions are finally resolved, the first thought that runs through my mind was, ""I've read 400 pages just so it could lead me to this??""Another thing, this book has too many sexual contents, but that's not the bad thing, the thing is, why is it there? What's the point? He could have reduce the uselessness of it to make the book shorter."
3,It was ok.....,I had a long flight and decided to read this book. It did keep you on the edge of your seat halfway through the book but then Stein came back to his the Fear Street roots and the last ten chapters were so predictable! And all the women always wear leggings in this book! I think I saw the word jeans once. The ending just made the book weird I still don't know what to think of it.....
4,THIS BOOK WAS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This was one of the best books I have ever read. When I first started reading fear street, I thought it was really predictable. This one was a little, but I didn't care. Others may not like it, but they obviously haven't read a lot of his books. Once you start reading his books and keep reading them, they become a lot alike. This book, I think, was his best book!"
2,Still waiting for Goosebumps to grow up.,"I did not feel any sympathy for these jacked-up characters and when someone finally got their scalp ripped off and their spine crushed, I merely felt relief that this was one less pathetic personality I had to keep track of. The dialog was as vapid as the intelligence of the lead character, Sara Morgan, who has an IQ of about room temperature and performs the expected Dumb-Damsel moves that makes for typical schlock suspense. (Oh gosh, can Liam really, really be so bad? Golly, Gee!) The story concept promises something terrifying along the lines of Saul, King or Koontz, but the terror it delivers is tame enough for Mr. Rodgers Superstitious Neighborhood."
2,"Not bad, but not great....Definately not scary","First of all, I must say that I loved R.L.Stines young adult novels (Fear Street series). So, I was hyped when I discovered he was trying his writing hand at an adult novel. The day it came out, I had it. I was disappointed, to say the least. The plot was far too predictable. His Fear Street books had more plot twists. Plus he used a recycled plot formula. What do I mean by recycled plot formula? Well, if you must, read the novel and you'll discover what I mean. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a horrible book, I've read much worse, but I have read much much better. Example; Stephen King's Bag Of Bones is one of the greatest novels of the supernatural I have ever read. I'd give Bag O' Bones a look at before reading Superstitious."
2,"Kind of fun, kind of silly. Generic horror.","It's kind of fun, but very predictable. He points you in a couple of directions but you can see the spin from a mile away. He uses some false thrills to simulate suspense in a couple of places. It only annoys because it's too cute, and reminds you of Goosebumps. Nice touch at the end. He does some cool telegraphic tension stuff with his prose: Little short bursts. The shadows ahead. Etc. The protagonist is too stupid to live, however. Uh, maybe she should have thought things over, or maybe called the cops right away, or maybe something else resembling common sense. Nice trashy read."
3,Disappointing ending!,"I read this for a book report in my freshman year of high school, and to be perfectly honest, I expected more from the author I have grown to love. Up until the last couple of chapters, it was going great, then the ending ruined the whole book for me. I wrote what I thought in my report and got a 97%, but that still doesn't make up for the lack of thought put into this book's ending."
3,What was that?,"From 1993 until about 1996, the Fear Street series were my books of choice since I was a preteen to teenager into horror. Around 1995, R.L. Stine first released Superstitious, his first book for adults and it was mentioned in a few of the Fear Street novels. Fast-forward to the summer of 2007, I found a copy of Superstitious at work and started to read it. Reading it made me remember the Fear Street series very quickly. The style was like an adult Fear Street book and it was quite interesting for most of the book. The latter half of the book is where it got extremely twisted. As my subject says, many times during the last few chapters, I was thinking, ""What was that"" or ""What the hell?"" It was memorable for sure and I am glad Stine has made an adult novel (and I heard there are at least two more now), but this was one of the most disturbing novels I have read and not because of the scare factor."
1,Not horror ... just horrible!,"Superstitious was billed as R.L. Stine's triumphant leap from his teenage ""Goosebumps"" series into intense adult horror fiction. Far from being terrified by this book, I found myself laughing at the ridiculous actions and insipid dialogue of Mr. Stine's stereotypical cast of characters. The author's lack of research concerning real police procedures is also quite evident. The only true horror I experienced was that such poor quality writing was ever published in the first place."
3,Not Bad,"As a fan of Stine's Goosebumps book series as a kid I decided to give Superstitious a chance and found I actually kind of liked it, there are problems of course, but Stine pens what I'd compare to a good slasher flick. I would advise that you reed this novel around Halloween time, it seems to fit into that time frame quite nicely. Overall I would say that Superstitious is a pretty good read and could be used especially to capitalize on the atmosphere of one of those cold and dark fall afternoons."
1,Absolutely one of the worst books I have ever tried to read.,"When this book came out, I received it as a Christmas gift. I tried to read it, and boy, did I stop trying after 70 pages. I would be lying if I said this is the worst book I've ever read, but only because I technically didn't ""read"" this. I read the beginning, skipped to the last 25 or 30 pages, and never messed with it again. I read one review where someone called this the best book they have ever read, and I thought, you poor soul. Unbelievably bad!!"
5,Best Book Ever,"This is the best book I have ever read. I could not put this book down, all I did was eat and read. There is no way anyone can come close to making a book as good as this one. Everytime you turn the page there is always a new twist. I will always remeber this book, it is diffently #1 on my list!!!!!"

4,One of the Better Conan Rip-Offs,"Arnold's ""Conan The Barbarian"" was released in 1982 and was an instant classic. Its my favorite Arnold flick. ""The Beastmaster"" was released later that summer and was an early rip-off on the far superior ""Conan"" film. The movie is about a very muscular and strong young man with the gift of communicating with animals. He is able to use his talents to get the animals to aid him in his quest to avenge the destruction of his village and death of his father by an evil cult. Marc Singer plays the role of the Beastmaster and he basically does a one-note performanc. Tanya Roberts plays a sexy and beautiful slave girl who he falls in love with and enlists her aid in his quest. Rip Torn is the evil cult leader but never really seems to be much of a threat to The Beastmaster. This movie is total 1980's sword and sorcery cheese and definitely more aimed at kids than ""Conan The Barbarian"" which definitely deserved its R rating."
2,awful quality,Got this movie for my boyfriend as it was one of his favorites when he was a kid and was so disappointed. It skips the entire way through. The movie itself is a really bad movie but I figured it would be. Entertaining for a cheesy 80s boys flick.
4,WAY AHEAD OF ITS TIME... DO NOT SEE THE SEQUELS!,"I remember watching this movie as a 5 year old little boy, dazzled by its cutting-edge effects and animal training techniques. I watched it again today for the first time since my early childhood and it still packs a wallop. Everything about this movie is just visually cool. The sets are dark and very believable, the animal stunts are simply stunning, and the make-up effects STILL manage to send chills down my spine (Man, those vampire-bat-humans and witches are SCARY). The screenplay wasn't exactly the greatest, but it serves its purpose well. One of the greatest ""fantasy"" movies of all time, hands down. If you like this check out ""Willow"". WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT SEE THE SEQUELS! They are just a sorry excuse to make a quick buck off of this one's fame."
3,Cheesy but fun - really should be PG-13,"I remembered watching this movie as a little girl, and loving all of the animals and sword fighting. Recently I rented it for my little boys... forgetting that it was made prior to the pg-13 rating. This is NOT a PG movie. True there was little in the way of language or slasher type blood and guts, but their eyes about popped out of their heads when the nude scenes that I did not recall occured. As far as the movie itself... bad acting, bad script, a whole lot of Marc Singer standing on top of a mountain swinging around a sword like a 4 year old with a stick. There really isn't all that much of a plot (did anyone else catch that he's now dating his cousin??? What screenwriter came up with that one??). But I have to admit, that it's a bunch of fun to watch, especially the critters. Would I spend $[...] to buy it? No.. will I watch it if it comes on USA, of course."
4,Andre Norton,"Perhaps I overlooked this fact elsewhere, but the inspiration for this movie came from Andre Norton's novel of the the same name. It amazes me that more of her plots have not been movie scripts. She wrote well over 100 S-F and fantasy novels, including her ""Witch World"" series. Fine writer=fine movie."
4,Animal Wars,"Beastmaster is one of the more enjoyable sword films from the early 1980's. The credentials of Marc Singer as a gifted prophet, whose ability to communicate with animals, forms a coherence unmatched by any other films. He gets along with the ferrets, a painted tiger, and an eagle. The plot concerns him doing battle with an evil warlock whose wretchedness is exemplary. The battle scenes are enjoyable and there is even some humor to go along with it all, not to mention Tonya Robert's cans. In the end we root for the good guys."
3,Beastmaster,Had to change the language to English because it starts with Korean subtitles. I am glad I did not have to return it.
5,happy with transaction,"ordered this hard to find movie, had it in possesion within a couple of days in perfect condition. couldn't be happier with the transaction"
5,Classic 80's Fantasy Film!,"The Beastmaster is one of those movies that I remember watching as a kid anytime it was on TV. Recently I was scanning HBO, and saw that they were showing it, and I couldn't believe it! It doesn't matter what anyone says about this classic movie, it still is enjoyable and entertaining to watch. It will definitely be part of my DVD library very soon!"
4,Cult Classic,"I remebered by younger brother watching this over and over on VHS when he was kid. My daughter loved it, watched it 4 times over a weekend."
3,One of the best bad movies,"A 'good' bad movie. Not for when you feel serious, but a good watch. My favorite scene is when the bad guy gets his club/axe thing stuck in the side of the bridge. Over the top all the way."
2,"Definitely not ""New""","This DVD appeared to be new... wrapped in plastic and sealed at the top of the case... but it had numerous scratches that impaired playing/viewing. After several ""stalls"" starting at about the halfway point it finally came to a complete halt. we skipped to the next chapter and it was able to continue, but numerous attempts at viewing the disrupted sections produced the same result. Maybe it was repackaged to look new before this seller got a hold of it, but it's definitely not new... it's abused."
4,The Beastmaster DVD,"The beastmaster has wonderful special effects. It's a fun movie with some good action scenes. Although the acting isn't the best, this is a favorite of mine."
5,Awesome Film!! Please Re-release it,I thought this was one of the best sci-fi/fantasy movies I have ever seen. I have been looking to purchase it forever and can't find it anywhere. Please re-release it so I can add it to my collection. I know there must be alot of people looking for this. The company could make a small fortune if they put it back out. I hope this review helps to do this. Thanks.
4,This great 'B' Movie is a guilty pleasure,"No one is ever going to accuse The Beastmaster of being one of cinema's crowning achievements, but it is an entertaining bit of escapism. It stands side-by-side with Flash Gordon (1980) as my favorite 'B' movie, although Flash Gordon is much more overtly campy. Make Moses look like Conan and act like Dr. Dolittle, and you've pretty much got the plot. Marc Singer makes a great protagonist - his physique is only a hair less imposing than Arnold's, and he's a heck of a lot better actor. I'd call this the best fantasy movie ever made, but that's kinda like giving out an award for the least smelly pair of unwashed feet. Turn off your brain and let yourself enjoy this one."
1,RET TAG MEDIA RIP OFF,"I ordered this Beastmaster DVD on Jan 31, 2009. Today is March 3, 2009 and I have yet to receive it. My VISA was charged $15.81 on Feb. 2, 2009. Red Tag Media is certainly one company that is thriving in this poor economy. I will soon go through the proper Amazon process to file a claim."
1,Very disappointing,"I must agree with a few other reviwers that firstly, the make up jobs were truly laughable. It was quite obvious that none of the actors, screenwriter, or director knows any country-type Communists or Russians who were not on their most Western behavior. How can you think of portraying Russian history when no one drinks any vodka in this film! Lenin and Trotsky are portrayed as simple-minded, hearts-in-the-right place chaps when in reality they were both as guilty as Stalin of brutality, paranoia, and countless ""official murders and exilings."" History also tell us that Stalin was a peasant who became a revolutionary journalist but never was as ""socially polished"" as Duvall portrays him. He was a street thug more along the lines of Al Capone and was not above personal violence of his own. This may be Hollywood, but it's certainly not history and certainly not Russian."
2,Salin VHS,"The product was in very good condition and worked great. The only issue was the speed of the delivery. It was mailed via media mail, so the mailing itself was slow, however, it saved money on shipping which was fine. The issue was it took almost two weeks for the seller to actually drop it in the mail. I orded it during the first week of September and the postal date was September 16. So good product but very slow in processing the order."
5,Helluva movie about one HELL of a heel!!!,"Duvall and Schell are in their roles of a lifetime as both Stalin and Lenin. Julia Ormond seems too classy to be believable, and Roshan Seth doesn't look like Beria at all; Bob Hoskins should have been cast for the part. Aside from that, it's one of the best docudramas ever made, and only goes to prove that Duvall is the most talented, and underrated, actor alive! I saw him in ""Wrestling Ernest Hemingway"" and didn't believe an American could play a Cuban so thoroughly convincingly as he did. You just couldn't tell the difference. Same thing here!"
4,Not a Bad Series,"Found three 2005 volumes, 1, 3 & 4 in the budget bin, with cut-out drilled holes. Seems they never made it to distribution. Ron Rice, whatever mastering was done, is credited. Decent sound quality. However, songs, such as ""Sweet Mary"" and ""Sky High"", on the companion ""70s One Hit Wonders"" CD(s) are mastered from vinyl, not tape!"
5,A Must Read,"I attended traditional schools, Biola University, Talbot School of Theology and Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, and they are all excellent institutions. However, I was looking for an alternative and cost-efficient approach to continuing my education when I came upon Dr. Walston's book. It is filled with a wealth of knowledge. I have never, until now, given an official recommendation, but I would recommend this book to anyone looking for an education, especially if nontraditional approaches to education might be considered. As a result of Dr. Walston's guide I avoided a number of fatal choices and enrolled in a very rigorous program at Columbia Evangelical Seminary. Whether you are looking to continue your education or are simply curious about alternative education, buy this book. It is a must read."
4,interesting,"The first aproach i had with antony was with his second album.This one, is as interesting as the second one. More orchestral and itense.Hope to hear new material soon"
2,"like the ""Hope there's someone""","I love them, but the ""Hope There's Someone"" has much more intensity and truth in the ballads...less instruments, less interference.still love them though."
2,Great teenage angst music,"Thirty years ago this would have been my kind of music. Now it's just self involved and repetitious. I think he's got an interesting voice that could be an asset with the right material.This material, however, just makes you want to say ""get over yourself!"". Every (and I do mean *every*) song is so much navel gazing.I imagine this stuff goes over well with the teenage Goth crowd. But for everyone else, listen for the voice, ignore the lyrics, and hope for better material in a future release."
4,Awesome Debut,"After buying `I Am A Bird Now' and being completely captivated I quickly went out and bought the self titled debut CD by Antony and the Johnsons and if you enjoyed their second album it is a pretty safe bet you will enjoy this as well. It is mostly in the same style and still has Antony's wonderful and unique vocals. I love `Atrocities' and the piano playing throughout this track is both melancholy and beautiful. I also adore the chorus on `Divine' which raises a smile every time I play it. This took me a few more listens than IAABN to fully get into it and I found the strings a little more obtrusive on some tracks, but once you do you will be just as enraptured and impressed. The artwork is original and unusual but that sums up Antony and the Johnsons perfectly, original and unusual, but always great. Well worth checking out at some point.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
5,Shining In The Darkness,"""I didn't know what had been missing from my life 'til i heard Antony & The Johnsons"". Both this album and 'I am a bird now' are beautiful and tragic records. This is a very moving album without ever getting depressing. I can hear alot of Bryan Ferry (circa Avalon) and Marc Almond in it. It's easy to picture it being sung by Antony under a bright white spotlight, center stage, in a smokey underground bar in Berlin in the 30's. Roses being thrown, tears being cried, all to rapturous applause..."
3,3.5stars,It works as advertised.I didn't realize that it wouldn't fix a phone with a silicon case around it until I tried and it didn't work.At least it keeps my phone screen safe in a brief case or backpack.I bought two and on broke quickly but this one still is holding up = everytHing is cheaply made these days...
3,Clip broke with in two weeks,"Fits the phone very well. Had it for two weeks and thought this was going to work for me. Then I went to set down in a chair, heard a pop, and my phone was on the floor. A little plastic nob on the clip broke. Things are only as good as its weakest link.Don't expect it to last very long.It's to bad, I liked how it fit and looked."
4,Excellent Product,Very well built case. As low of a profile as you can get with the EVO. You can still see the message indicators on the phone when the holster is attached. Excellent product.
2,Simply not durable,"I've purchased two of these holsters and while I want to like the product, the bottom line is it just simply isn't durable. With the first one I purchased, the clip at the top of the holster that holds the phone broke within a matter of weeks. With the second purchase, the belt clip broke as I went to sit down. I really wanted to like this product because I liked the felt covered lining of the holster that the face of the phone rests against and I liked the swivel action of the holster. Sadly though, this is a poorly constructed product that simply does not withstand normal day to day use for very long."
5,exactly as advertised,Quick to ship and items are exactly as advertised. I recommend this product to any one with a htc evo
3,Holster for HTC 4G by Boxwave,"Great holster, poor clip. I actually bought two of these and the first one broke within a week. The belt clip shatters with any nominal pressure. Fair at best."
5,great product,"Nice case, fits phone great. Clip could be a little more user friendly. Case has nice smooth finish and felt for phone side."
3,Holster,"Good for the price, love the material only problem is that it broke after a few months due to my line of work but for daily use its ok. thank you"
5,Fabulous,"Kisa Kane is an inspiration to women all over the world who are striving to be a strong, independent women in a hard world. I loved the honesty of the book and could relate to the struggles of Kisa. I would recommend this book to anyone!"
2,Not what I thought,"The title of the book, led me to beleive that the book would be about a ghetto girl struggling in the ghetto and she overcame her trials. this book jumped around to much and did not seem real."
2,Think real hard about it!!!,"Honestly, I would think real hard before I buy this book if I were you. Really it's just my opinion but the book was not all that great I really don't understand the 40 some odd people who gave this book 5 stars! First of all it starts out slow and her writing style and dialogue just didn't work for me I couldn't get into it. It was a struggle it did start to grab my attention in the middle though. There was definitely way too much focus on name brand clothing, which took away from much of the story line. Also timing was off, I was confused because the book started off with Kisa's 21st b-day party but later on in the book she was turning 21 again?? I honestly don't know how old the chick was when the book ended or how much time went by during the whole story. It was a mess! If you are in your teens you may really love this book, I'm 26 so it just didn't do it for me. Sorry!! You should form your own opinion but in my advice...think real hard!"
2,Ms Gerry,"The story had potential, but the writing sucked and don't let me get started on the editing. You can be reading along and all of a sudden, you're reading the same thing again. OR you may be reading about one day then it skips to the next week or month. This book was actually a pain to read."
2,Disappointed!,I bought this book based soley on these reviews.I was extremely disappointed.From now on i will pay more attention to the negative reviews as I agree with all of them.You all should be more honest when writing your reviews because some people actually pay attention to them.thanks
2,Not Another Ghetto Story,"This book was okay, not one of my favorites. I got tired of reading about every article of clothing Kane bought, wore or wanted. All the designer name dropping took away from the story line and got on my last nerve. This book really could have been converted into a short story if we didn't have to read about every characters clothes, jewelry, shoes, purses, etc.... Just Okay for me, tired of reading about the ""Lifestyles Of The Ghetto Fabulous."" And can somebody please tell me what was up with the author using the ""N"" word in every other sentence, was that necessary?"
4,It was ok,"This book was ok but it'd definitely not what I expected.. from reading Grindin I thought this would be a sure banger.. but like I said it was ""ok"""
5,Awesome!,I adore all of miss Santiago's books but this one is definitely my favorite! I've read it over 10 times and its line reading it for the first time every time!This book is DEFINITELY a must read!!
3,Ok I get the point!,The book overall was good but I could do without the description of what clothes they had on all the time and how much they cost. What the author failed to do was verify the characters complete backgrounds. Yeah I know that Sincere's grandpa was Italian and a made man but what else was Sincere? Was he also black or what and who was black his grandma or his daddy? There's also not enough info about Kisa's father. Where was he when she went home to her momma? The book does not give enough information or explore the pasts of the characters.
2,Waste of money,Calll me a hater if you like but this is one of the worst book i've ever read.from kisa and sincere constantly breaking up and getting back together. All the name brand clothes that they kept talking about. It was to much. I found myself skipping parts in the book. The only good part was the end. If you do buy this book just skip to the last couple of chapters and you will be okay
4,Slow start,"This book took awhile to get into, but once I had the time to sit down and really read it. . .i loved it. This is a book that you'll need to take an hour or two out your day to read. It is a great book - - if you have the time to read it all at once"
5,Page turner!!!,"This book had me addicted. I read it all in one sitting. Unfortunately, I could relate to the book which brought back memories. That means a job well done for Santiago."
5,Best Urban fiction In a long time,This is the BEST book i have read since B-More careful. 6 star book. If you dont have this book go get it!!!!!!!!
5,Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book was off the hook. Very real and true to life. KisaKane is a bad chick!. She is a strong black women who is able to juggle many aspects of life, some good and some bad. Great book to read."
5,One of the best books I ever read.,"This book is one of the bests book I ever read. Yea it starts like some other books or have the traits of other books, however, the twist is totally new to me & I love it. It showed a lot of passion & skills to me. This is a book I would re-read over & over again. Danielle Santiago is a great writer!"
5,awsome book!,this was a excellent book. I read it in a hour and a half. I think that anyone interested in a good book should read this. excellent job Ms. Pollinger!
3,"Wordy, One Dimensional & Dated.","I have to buy the book for a college course.This is great for personal use except content seems mostly based on abut 2009.Text is one dimensional. In other words, the book has few learning aids that the best textbooks use on every page to emphasized, prioritized etc. Some pages go on with just black and white text.They have tons of support information and examples incorporated with the text. This blurs the line between support material and key learning objectives. Chapter 4, for example is about 40 pages total. They could have pulled all the examples and statistical information out of the body of the text and created support sections or inserts that are highlighted with different color background. This is a bit tedious for the average student. But as I said, content is good."
1,It is a book not a tv.,"I only bought this because I had to for school, but this is way to expensive. I can not believe they charge this much for a book."
2,"Essentials of Marketing, 7th Edition","The content is fine. I had to get it for class. I decided to get the ebook since it is a lot cheaper. This is a mistake. This is the worst e-book I have bought.The book doesnt go by page number, so when my prof asks us to turn to a certain page, it is nearly impossible to find.The images are small. You can only enlarge the images.It is worth the extra money to buy the book instead of the ebook. My 30 dollar management book came with the e-book for FREE and it is wonderful. It is categorized by chapter, section, has page numbers, print options, and so much more."
3,It's OK,"It's an ok text but I often find myself referring to outside sources for better explanations of the topics, as well as examples."
2,Lori L,Not wild about this book. Thoughts don't seem to follow a linear fashion. There seems to be a lot of looping around and unnecessary fillers. I found myself drifting off and losing sight of the concept. I think the subject is interesting but I wish my instructor had chosen a better book.
4,Delivered as advertised...,"I ordered this book on line for class and received it within the expected timeframe. The description of the book's condition was accurate, and there were no surprises. I really appreciated the email from the seller when the item was shipped.I would order from this seller again."
3,Shipping Issues,"My book came almost a week late after I paid for two day shipping. On top of this the books has minor damage from shipping which I was very disappointed in. My book sat at the UPS center from Thursday to Monday instead of being shipped as promised. I'm not sure if I will continue to use Amazon in the future or not, time will tell."
4,yeah,"this game definitely lives up to the words on the back of the box:""the army men game you'v been waiting for!"".wait.before I get started,let me tell you what made the previous army men games so bad that this title remembered to not to do.the last ones didn't realistically get the true feeling of war.for example,in green rogue,you are all by your self against a large,locked and loaded army.and in like army men world war for pc,its just you'r 3 or 4 men vs.the big tan army.well,in this game,you got to make a base and command lots and lots of soldiers, making a fight with your grunts and choppers vs.thier grenaders feel more like a real battle or campaign.while it is tons of fun,what if it has some small,and possibly EXTREME,problems?"
3,Pretty good... (3.5 stars),"I'm a Laswell freak, he occupies most of the right side of my CD rack.This disc is pretty good. There's some trancendental moments indeed. I admit I'm not really an Irish music fan to start... but I definitely appreciate this disc.One thing though Bill, the two Karan Casey tracks.. I'm sorry, but I didn't dig em. Like the reviewer up top said, it sounds more like a collision than a collusion. I still love you though!"
4,These guys are good,"If you are looking fo something new, the dynasty is the answer. They r no Wu Tang but I like tha way of rappin of dynasty."
1,Comatose,This is a weak Australian horror about a man (Patrick) who has some telekenetic powers after he is put in a coma. Whilst in a coma he lets havoc reign in his hospital.There is not much more to say about this film.
1,NOT for little kids!!!!!!,"I bought this game for my little girl because it looked cute and funny. The supposed ""Everyone"" rating that Amazon claims it has made it sound like it would be okay. Once I got it I noticed that the rating on the box actually says ""T"" for teens. The elves are funny, but also rude, violent and crude. They rip eachother's heads off, and go around with their pants down showing their naked little elf behinds while they spank themselves and yell out ""Who's your daddy!"" Yeah, so my daughter was disappointed, to say the least, wondering why the elves would give her this game for Christmas if she's not even allowed to play it now. :("
1,WARNING: Item that shipped was not item described/displayed,"I bought this item because it was a ""Mesh"" basket. What shipped to my home was a large ""Wire"" basket that did not match the picture or description for this item at all. Not cool."
1,Not what I wanted or would have expected....JUNK!,I purchased this to have a basket to keep my small yard items in. It arrived and was a little bent from the journey and by the bad packaging by amazon warehouse. I put it up and found the basket sits at a steep angle different from any of my other rubbermaid hooks. This forces all of your items to slide to the front and puts extra weight on the fast track. This thing is junk and needs to be discontinued.
4,Nice and Sturdy Basket,"I was in error when I bought this for INDOORS as it definitely belongs outdoors. I couldn't figure out how to hang it but I am a female. I think a man could figure it out. Also, it is advertised as ""mesh"" when in fact in is ""wire"". The only thing that keeps me from giving this item a five (5) star rating is the fact that it is not ""mesh"", but it DOES look like the picture."
2,"This is a wire basket, not a mesh basket","As others have said, this item is misrepresented. It is a wire basket, not a mesh basket. What you get is not what you see in the picture.Otherwise the basket was in good shape, so I give it a 2 stars for sending me a good product I didn't ask for."
1,Caveat Emptor,"This is one time that Amazons price is greater than Home Depot, EVEN WITH FREE SHIPPING! There model 5E08FTSNCKL is $19.97 and $7 shipping."
1,99% Myths,"This video is basically a bunch of anti-marijuana propaganda. It shows no facts for the claims it makes. It pretty much puts Cannabis on the same level as Cocaine, Heroin, and Methamphetamine. Shame on the creators of this film for mis-informing the viewers."
5,very good information,"I get so tired of seeing these people leave there proraganda on every thing drug related on Amazon. This video does an excellent job of presenting very truthful and factual information about mariluana. It makes no moral judgement about weather marijuana should be legalized or not, it just presnets the facts about what it can do to your body and mind. Don't buy into the pro-drug hype these druggies are pushing. Buy a professional and well researched video like this one and learn the real truth."
4,The number Two hit of the year,This was number two on Billboards Hits of the year even though it peaked at number Two.This had a good hip hop type verse from R.Kelly all the kids would love this song probally.Lyrics 9/10 Production 9/10 Overall 9/10
5,Standard High Quality Rubbermaid,"I have the FastTrack in my garage and it is great at getting tools, toys, bikes, wheelbarrow, etc off the floor and close to the wall. I use this hook to hold 2 grass rakes and a weedeater. Great space-saving tool."
4,Younblood Sample,"This sampling gives a pretty good idea of the products. There were some extras included that I wasn't expecting (rice powder and blush), but I thought the color choices for the foundations didn't give enough range. I found most of them too dark for my light skin and I know the brand has better colors."
2,"Not bad, but not the best","This sampler is a very well rounded set. It's got a good variety of colors for light skin tones. The product however doesn't meet up to my expectations. I've got combination skin with areas of large pores. This product, even when combined with a foundation primer, doesn't sit well on my skin. The coverage isn't that bad really. But it looks a bit caked on, and seems to emphasize my problem areas. The Light finishing powder is the only one of this set that I may order in the future. It's got a very delicate texture that covers all areas of the face, including under the eyes, without settling into lines, dry skin, or other trouble areas. The blush didn't have good coverage at all. It has no lasting power. The color it gives is useful for a very subtle glow, but as it doesn't last on the skin it is only good for short periods. Overall, this brand is not going on my favorites list."
3,it was just ok,"i have very oily skin and after wearing it less than half an hour, im really shiny again. it is softer compare to others i've tried."
5,surprisingly good.,"This is different from your typical Fairport album.Very understated and narrative.It kind of grows on you especially the underrated earie ""Dream"""
1,Doesn't Look Good,These license plate frames have been on my two Hondas for almost a year and they are pitted and have rust spots bleeding through the chrome. They certainly do NOT make the vehicles look better.
4,Good. Looks nice. Shine remains.,Good product. The shine remains. But the screws get rust and that rust flows over the plates.
4,"Easy to install, nice looking","Very pleased with this frame. It is heavy duty, was easy to install, even for a woman. It also looks very nice."
1,good at first,"looked good at first, but then got dull, and pitted, couldnt get it clean again. shame cause its a good design"
2,Great but buggy?,"I have been a fan of Canvas since Canvas 6. I have upgraded and always installed new versions. With Canvas 8 I still have the same old problems of corrupting the data when saved. Then when you load back up, it's corrupt. This time the modify, uninstall or just try to reinstall would error out also, leaving me with a program that doesn't work. It does have some wonderful easy to use features, when it works. I used to prefer this over Corel 9, but now I just don't have the patience to work with its bugs, so its back to Corel 9. I have had long periods of time when the bugs don't pop up, so I recommend, buy at your own risk. Sorry Deneba"
1,See Chapter 11,"The pictures are tiny, grainy, black and white--the text is worse. Almost every paragraph is punctuated with brackets. (See chapter 3.)Most of the (parenthesis) are unnecessary or allude to information, which is practically non-existent. (For more information see any chapter.)The abundance of cross-referencing makes this book almost impossible to read. The most blatant example was the last sentence of chapter ten. (See chapter 11.)Definitely and only for dummies."
3,could use more illustrations... considering the subject matter,This guide could use more illustrations... considering the subject matter is most easily explained visually. A picture is worth a hundred words. A fabulous book on architecture is Eyewitness Companions Architecture by Jonathan Glancey.
5,Awesome tool to teach you to study the scriptures,I have struggled for years when it comes to studying the bible. I figured out how to read multiple versions to gain understanding but that was about it. This book shows so many easy to use tools to help you get a much better understanding of God's Word. I highly recommend this for new and old Christians alike who want to learn to do more than just read God's Word. Learn to study in various ways to enhance your understanding of the Scriptures.
1,A WORTHLESS POSSESSION,"IT HAS A JUMBLE GAME, BUT CANNOT SOLVE A JUMBLED WORD OF YOUR SELECTION (IT IS OF NO ASSISTANCE IN PLAYING THE DAILY JUMBLE GAME).IF YOU MISSPELL A WORD IT WILL COME UP WITH A WORD FROM NOWHERE. SPELL CHECK IT IS NOT.THE TOUCH SCREEN OPERATION IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO SOMEONE WITH ADVANCED ARTHRITUS.INVEST YOUR MONEY IN A GARBAGE CAN."
3,Not as Great as her Later albums,"This is the first album for Gloria Deluxe (Cynthia Hopkins and her band), and it has a lot of charm and humor. But it has not won my heart in the same quick and easy way that later albums have, such as ALAS ALACK and (especially) ACCIDENTAL NOSTALGIA. But if you have already explored those discs and you like them, then this one is certainly worth picking up. Enjoy!"
