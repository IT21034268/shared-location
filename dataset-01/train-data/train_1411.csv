5,Wow. Great album.,"I was stunned by this album. It's hard to imagine someone not liking this music, it's that good. Every now and then I hear someone new and great, this is one of those artists. Paolo's voice is very unusual, with some great accents adding texture to the lyrics, and his writing is superb.There are lots of comparisons out there to other artists but honestly I'd call Paolo a unique sound. My comparisons range more towards the creativity and wonder of a Bob Marley, Jackson Browne, Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison, etc. Like these great musicians, Paolo is able to take common thoughts and emotions and express them in heartfelt ways through music.Who knows if he'll keep it going, but for now I'll simply sit back and enjoy this album. Nothing like some new shoes to chear me up :-)."
4,These Streets,"He's a poet. His lyrics are thoughtful. His voice is sexy, sultry, sad. I am really enjoying the music."
4,Better than expected,"I decided to buy this CD after hearing the catchy ""Jenny Don't Be Hasty"" track on Sirius Spectrum. I was more than pleasantly surprised to find a really great collection of songs. Several of the tracks reminded me of another of my favorite CDs, ""Long Time Coming"" by Jonny Lang. Nutini's vocals on a couple of the tracks even sound like they could have been sang by Lang. I am not at all a blues fan but this CD seems to mix in just enough of a blues element to separate it from the run-of-the-mill male pop/rock acts that seem to dominate commercial radio."
2,Music OK - but what is he saying? :-<,"While I like some of these songs, I cannot understand a single word he sings. I even heard him interviewed and I didn't understand a word. When he sings, he spends all the time looking down, so you can't even lip read. I don't think he has stage presence and I think it will be hard to grow a fan base with a singer who can't form words. He doesn't sing clearly and I just can't get into his music completely. I think I'll stick to R&B."
1,EEEEEWWWWW!,"There is just no accounting for (lack of) taste. I've read the reviews of this CD --- ""brilliant"" ""soul singer""????????What the hell kind of soul singer is that?? He just sounds like an old drunk or junkie who is slurring his speech before he nods off.Easily the most pretentious and annoying act I've heard (or seen) since David Gray."
5,listening to live earth now!!,"when i heard new shoes on tv, i knew i had to have this album. awesome!! and i'm listening to his performance on the Live Earth stage right now on my computer!"
5,This artist is going places,"I am always on the lookout for up and coming new singer songwriters to add to my collection so when I heard New Shoes on a Paste Magazine CD I knew Paolo Nutini was the perfect addition. For me, I can tell how good a CD is by how long it stays in my car's CD player. I have a long commute and no CD changer so I listen to the same CD over and over until I get tired of it. A mediocre CD is lucky to last a week. These Streets lasted over 2 months and when it was replaced it was immediately put on my MP3 player for at-work listening. Every song is a gem with some that sparkle just a tad more. My favorites are These Streets, a song about moving to an unfamiliar place, and Autumn, a beautiful and moving tribute to his late grandfather. Of course New Shoes is one of the best with catchy lyrics that you can't help but sing along with at the top of your lungs...well I can't anyhow ;)All in all this is a great addition to any CD collection."
5,A True Artist,"I stumbled across Paolo Nutini's album, These Streets, after hearing ""New Shoes"" play on my sister's iPod at random. I enjoyed the song and sought the album out. I came to discover that These Streets is a uniquely diverse album offering a range of well written songs and melodies. This is one of the better albums I have heard in the past year or so. Paolo is a truly talented artist who knows what being soulful is really about. The songs vary in styles, but the underlying musicianship is the same throughout. Paolo's voice, the most captivating part of the mix, is natural and inviting. Anyone looking for some great music should look no further- Paolo Nutini has what you need."
4,It's a good album,Paolo Nutini has presented a solid album. His writing and hooks are strong. He has the potential to be a great artist. He has natural talent that will grow as he ages.
2,"Surprise, Surprise! (Two of a Kind, No 19)",This book was very unrealistic although it had an intriguing plot. I would recommend this book to marykate and ashley fans
1,Best Things Parents Do,"There was nothing in here that even closely resembled that someone had ""thought through"" what they were saying. It was just normal thinking and nothing new."
4,Beauty is pain!,"These shoes ARE gorgeous, however, they are anything but comfortable. If you want to look great at the office and still have feeling in your feet at the end of the day, don't get these! They are NOT for running around in. Besides that, they have a runway look without the outrageous price tag!"
4,Where Have You Been All My Life?,"This band, by far, is one of the greats of the recent release field. Poppy-rock is what I would like to refer the sound to. Don't be afraid to grab this one off the shelves it is well worth the money and a piece to keep in your collection for a lifetime. My senses were instantly appealed and I felt as if the lyrics pulled most anyone in for a roller-coaster ride throughout the album. If it doesn't strike your fancy listen to it again and decide then."
1,Save your money,"I am a fleet mechanic for a local city and thought this would help lube plugged zerks. Nope I've tired it on garbage trucks, wheel loaders and more equipment we have and it did NOT work on any of them. Save your money it doesn't work."
4,IOPA GREASE JOINT REJUVENATOR,I used this product to clear out hardened grease in grease zerks on my tractor.These do not work in all situations!!! If the grease has not hardend up totally and you can inject the proper solvent to disolve all the old grease you can clear the joint with it ok. The old disolved grease must have a way to escape !! You must inject the solvent into the grease zerk and all of the hardened grease inside around the bottom of the zerk and let it dissolve. This method only works about half the time!!! You are better off removing the fitting and cleaning out all grease and residue with solvent and a blow gun when possible. Finding the proper solvent to melt the hardened grease is the secret to getting this tool to work. I probably would not buy another one if this one ever fails!!!!
3,Diverse alt-electronic sampler,"Some of these songs fail as a working whole (particularly in the 1st half) though by the end I couldn't help but appreciate such eclectic production, which makes the disc more then average."
4,Great movie! My daughter loves it!,"I want to say that the review that states Angelina's bad behavior is innacurate, the reviewer must not have watched the entire film. Having watched waaaay too many times with my 2.5 year old (who loves it!) I can say Angelina's character is just like her usual character- sweet, fun loving, and usually accidentally getting into a little trouble, but for the right reasons. I would recommend this to all Angelina fans!"
1,Disappointing story line.......,"My daughter received this for her 3rd birthday (a BIG Ballerina Princess Fan-LOL). I haven't let her watch it since. I was so disappointed in the story line . I was hoping for something more along the lines of a sweet ballerina friendship story , and NOT one where the little mouse characters act like spolied brats. My daughter loves her Angelina doll , but in this story Angelina acts like a mean little girl, who to get her way blames her mistakes on others. Not exactly something I would want my little daughter to learn."
4,Bring back JHJ!!,"It's too bad this band wasn't around longer. Great vocals, instrumentals, and lyrics make this obscure band one of my favorite from the 80's. Original singer Clark Datchler sings most of the songs on this disc, including Shattered Dreams and I Don't Want to Be a Hero. But Phil Thornalley (ex-bassist from the Cure)filled in nicely on a couple of the other tracks here, like Turn the Tide and Let Me Change Your Mind Tonight."
4,BEST THAT YOU CAN GET .....,"IN the 80's there were some pop band that made it some who did not.This is one that did not but had great tunes like:don't let it end this way,i don't want to be a hero and other songs..THE 80'S HAD A LOT TO GIVE US IN MUSIC MORE THAN 1960:(breathe,crew cutting and other's).BUT FOR THE MONEY THIS IS A GREAT BUY..TAKE MY WORD FOR IT,"
2,Still Searching,This book did not hold my attention for long. Same ground covered over and over again.
3,Heavy Christian leaning but helpful,"I am not a Christian and am more of an Agnostic. This book leans very heavily toward Christianity which at times was annoying and I skimmed through a lot of it. Parts of it were very helpful to me however. I'm glad I read it, just not sure I would recommend it for everyone."
5,Good book,When your looking for something to help you through the greiving of a loss from suicide I suggest you get this book to start. You will be able to start to make it through relizing you will never find an answer but you need to read to find that out.
3,Too painful to read,"I bought this book for a relative, whose two children committed suicide. I wanted to read it myself before giving it to her, to make sure that it would not devastate her even further. I could not finish the book. It was much too painful to read it. Maybe there is nothing anyone can say to comfort a mother on such a loss."
2,Butchery!,"Before buying this DVD, I already owned the vast majority of these cartoons on various VHS tapes. The reason I purchased it anyway was to get superior copies of the toons listed. Boy what a disappointment! The sound has been totally screwed up! In an attempt to enhance the the sound, Fox Lorber added sound effects that don't fit very well with the cartoons. (In other words the sounds they added are louder than the rest of the sound track and more clear... making them a serious distraction) The most obnoxious addition is on ""Daffy Duck and the Dinosaur"".At the end, when the Caveman goes to stab the giant inflatable duck, the morons who worked on the restoration added sounds from the ""Psyco"" shower scene. What a waste of money. I'll be watching my old VHS tapes instead. Fours stars (for providing a copy of great cartoon shorts) minus two stars (for terrible sound) equals two stars."
1,Crap,My system is beyond what you need for this game and I couldn't even get into a training mission without locking up.
1,piece of !#@!,I looked at the system requirments and it matched that of my computer. I bought the game. I tried to play it but the !#%! was slower than my calculator. Same thing happened with Specops2.
2,Very poor book.,A terrible book. Very poor at explaining the subject material and has a lot of esoteric vocabulary thats heavily used through the text. Highly do not recommend.
4,Good introduction to Complex variable,"This is an undergraduate level text, Regardless of the price which is little too expensive, it is a good book to start with Complex variables with adequate End-of-chapters' exercises, however some of the practical problems are really challenging without enough examples to cover the methods.- Ramin Shamshiri, Summer 2010, Gainesville."
3,Very easy to read.,"The book is very easy to read, but math majors might find it disappointing. It is just not rigorous for a math text, and when you end up taking a higher level complex analysis course in graduate school, you'll find this book to be a little useless.However if you are a science/engineering major who just need some light introduction to complex analysis without the rigor, this is a good book/"
1,Worst Math Book,"This book does not deserve even two stars. The ""examples"" they give are just explanations and not real EXAMPLES in question and answer format, therefore it is never clear what the problem is actually asking. Furthermore, critical steps are omitted in most explanations, and proofs requiring the user to search for other sources to fill in those gaps. No visual connections to geometry are shown, just words, and rarely as well."
5,The best math book ever,This is the ONLY math book i've ever really liked! (And i was a physics major/math minor.) It was just beautiful.
1,Missing solutions to hard problems,"A great solutions manual if you want to see the answers to all of the easy problems that you already knew how to do. It was a bit frustrating to find that the author of this solution manual either could not do or decided not to provide the solutions to the difficult problems.A note to Mr. Brown:The idea that more than one answer may be possible is no justification for not including an answer in a solution manual. Just include your best solution, and then write, ""Answers may vary.""See how easy that was...."
3,It is what it is,"God knows this book is used by everybody and their brother to teach Complex Variables. Why, I do not know. Dry as dust and even more boring. ""Proofs"" are minimal and the exercises are plug and chug. Still, it has the acceptance of academia. Enjoy."
4,Great Complex Variables Book,This book is an pretty good book for A Complex Variables class - I used it in my Summer Complex Variables class you will need the solutions manual you can get a subscription on Chegg for access to the solutions because the selected solutions doesn't have everything in it-That is why I am giving this a 4 stars becuase some of the problems are not straight forward and require much thinking- sometimes in class students were lost in class trying understand some of the homework problem especially the proving onesI have learned much of complex Analysis/variables from this book and I will keep it in my Math Library for Reference later.
2,Impossible Princess review,"I'm an avid Kylie fan. This album however isn't my favorite. It's cute, I'll give it that, but I wouldn't stress out about hearing most of these songs again. There are certainly some great songs on here (Breathe and the remixes) but again not my favorite."
1,Impossible Princess,"I enjoy this artist but I am really disappointed in this purchase, I don't recommend it."
3,This is an OK book. Read Shadow Song instead.,I am an avid fan of Terry Kay. However this book was not his best. I thought the ending left me with a lot of questions unanswered. The plot was creative but I felt cheated by the ending. Read Shadow Song it is so much better!
2,"No suspense, no philosophical worth","Having read To Dance with the White Dog and having found it a great read about aging, I was really looking forward to this one. Unfortunately, there is practically zero suspense to the book because the kidnappers are SO nice. Nor is the book a great ""coffee table"" discussion book about the worth of life. Great idea, but weak execution."
2,Better movie or stage play plot than recreational read.,"When I heard the premise of this book, it intrigued me, and I wanted to read it. Although I usually devour books cover to cover in one to two sittings, I kept putting this book down, and when I picked it up again, I couldn't remember the forgettable characters. Perhaps there are too many characters. When more than two people are speaking, you have to count backwards to attribute the sentences to somebody as the author certainly doesn't. And the female characters all wear gray slacks or skirts. The story starts out fluid and gripping but deteriorates into a big yawn. Sorry."
1,Slapdash and condescending,"Good grief. Mr. Kay should have simply written a screenplay rather than a novel, since that's obviously his intention with this book. Stereotypical characters and plot, stock situations, condescending to his audience. His original premise had merit, but he obviously lost interest, decided it wouldn't sell to Hollywood, and wrote a predictable murder story. I would have liked to read the book he didn't write. This novel doesn't even deserve one star, and Mr. Kay should be ashamed of himself."
5,Changing Table and more!,"I use my Pack 'n Play primarily as a changing table for now and works great. I live in a small effiency so storage is key. The bottom of Pack 'n Play is filled with pampers (buy in bulk) and the top portion with diaper and bath necessities. I even placed my wipe warmer on the side of the changing table and works out great.When we go out on trips, I just empty out and take it to go. My six month twins still both fit in it.I recommend this for people with lack of space in their homes or if you're needing a changing table with extras."
3,DOes it's job,"This playpen does it's job. It appears to be sturdy. After going through this new mother expereince, I realize there are a few things I would do differnetly when I make purchases. As for a playpen, I probably would have just bought a regular playpen withough all the gadget, since she already has most of the other gadgets anyway.I like...The music is good. It is also nice have the little are to store the necessities for changing.Don't like...Not sure what the purpose of the light is.. It is very very dim. Also the bears do not spin unless you manually stand there and spin them... quite annoying. My daughter is fascinated with the bears, but don't make the mistake of starting the spinning process, because you cannot stop without having her cry. The changing table is nice, but between the second and third month it is useless."
1,safety hazard,"I was excited to finally find a pack n play with all of the features I wanted. However, when I got this Ivy League Graco pack n play home the changing pad did not have a strap on it. The box showed that it had one and so did the display at Babies R Us. I took it back and they opened another box and again that one did not have a safety strap. The manager said she was going to contact Graco. I don't know why Graco is showing a strap on the box but I find that misleading and intend on contacting them myself.Lori, Missouri"
4,Pack N Play,I love this pack and play. the only thing that sucks about it is that not everything fits in the bag after you pack it up.
2,disappointed by recipe selection,"This book is great for learning about Jewish traditions. But I was disappointed by the selection of recipes. If you take away the Jewish recipe names, it is mostly just a standard collection of vegan recipes. I wanted to learn how to make vegetarian matzoh ball soup, tzimmes, noodle pudding and rugelach. Instead I found recipes for ratatouille, spicy peanut pasta, tamales and baklava. Which would have been fine for an international cookbook, but not what I was looking for in a Jewish cookbook. I ended up returning the book."
1,Did I read this entire book once before?!?,"If so, I don't know how. This book really irritated me the second go round. I bought it because of the glowing reviews, but it did not click. I read a couple of the beginning pages and skimmed through the book. Nothing stuck. So, it must go."
5,I LOVE THIS DOLL!!!,HE IS JUST SOOOO CUTE!!! PLUS HE COMES WITH LOTS OF CLOTHES INCLDING OUTERWEAR AND 2 PAIRS OF BOOTS. HE ALSO COMES WITH 15 DIFFERENT ACCESORIES THAT INCLUDE SKIING AND SLEDDING GEAR. HE HAS THE MOST INNOCENT LOOKING LITTLE FACE AND HIS OUTFITS ARE VERY COOL. YES I HAVE FOUND YET ANOTHER DOLL THAT I MUST HAVE!
3,nfl helmet,I rate this so so. The picture shows the new logo for the Lions but we got one with the old logo. That was the only problem I had
4,meets expectation,"The helmet was what I expected. It makes for a nice display item in the proper setting. The team logo was a sticker but that was not a surprise. Also purchased a Michigan helmet from Schutt and it was a little nicer. The Michigan trademark wings and stripes were painted on. If purchasing a college helmet, I recommend buying a Schutt. Unfortunately, Schutt is not licenced by the NFL to make their team helmets. Riddell does a nice job but Schutt does better."
5,Great Riddell Helmet!,"It was a great purchase and the gift recipient loved it! I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested! Fast delivery, easy transaction, reasonable price!"
1,cruel to my dogs,This item should be re-called. The blade is not sharp enough and the cutting action is flimsy. Cuts are not clean. This was torture for my small dogs. The cutter actually bends the claw. I would return this if I had kept the packaging.
1,Not a good clipper - very disappointed,"I got this clipper based on the one review on here and I was very disappointed. I knew it was for small dogs but it didn't work for my three small dogs (they range in weight from 10 pds-30pds,) maybe it is meant for really small dogs like chihuahuas. When I used it on my dogs it would turn their nails sideways because of the shape of the nail which caused them pain. Even when I tried clipping their nails sideways to compensate it still turned their nails. Also, it wasn't a strong/sharp clipper and it really took some force to get through the nail...the only thing I liked about the clipper was the septic container in the handle, but that's doesn't make it worth buying."
5,Easy to use,Easy to use and does the trick. Now if only my dog will hold still! I also like the styptic powder built in the handle so u can have it handy if you need it.
4,works good,"was what i expected and worth the money. i like how the styptic vial fits in the handle- pretty nifty. only complaint -the file is really small and doesn't really do anything, but i didn't expect much else. If i could just get my dog to sit still it'd work even better.=)"
2,Would not purchase this style clippers again!,"I ordered these and thought they would be great, but unfortunately prefer the scissor type over the guillotine style. Now these just sit there unused and I just placed an order for the good ole scissor style. I do like that they have the styptic and file all inclusive, but the style just doesn't work well for my dogs little feet."
5,My kind of Mozart,"I am so glad that her recordings are on CD now. I had the pleasure of a brief coaching with Madame Kraus when I was eleven years old. I was able to attend many of her live performances and have the old LP versions with a personal note and signature. Now I can listen to her interpretation of Mozart without worrying about my prized LPs! I think she has a good solid approach to Mozart; not too dull yet staying true to the period. She was an amazing musician and teacher, I attended her master classes and it was just magical. So nice to be able to hear her fresh sound today."
5,Balefire,"Even tho this book is 30 years old it is still one of the best books I have ever read. And I've read alot. The technology has advanced, but people have not changed. Wonderful!"
4,"All Night, All Day African American Spirituals",Bought for my Goddaughter's son. She likes it and plans to read it to him.
3,"Nice, but not all that was advertised...","The ads said ""every map ever published for the Forgotten Realms"". Not even close.The tiling of the smaller scale maps means that some key areas overlap two maps, thus making it impractical to impossible to implement some of the smaller scale published maps in the current product format.On the other hand, the maps they do have are gorgeous. And the globe feature is nice, though they would have been better off to do regional maps to match the regions on the globe exactly rather than try for the adjoining rectangular maps. (So what if there's overlap in the regional maps? That's how real-world maps work - they map relevant regions and don't worry about, or account for, overlap.)Overall, a decent version 1.0 proof-of-concept. Next time out, if the lessons are learned from this time, should be spectacular."
1,CHEAPEST PAPER BACK KNOWN TO MANKIND,A lot of the necessary information is left out pertaining to the vehicles that is suppose to have the instructions inside and it is made of the cheapest paper made known to mankind. Wont order another one of these ever again.
2,Silly mistakes and lack of colour mar this book,"Since another reviewer on this page has pointed out the Fat Freddys Cat mistake, I thought I'd draw readers attention to the other problems with this book. The Captain America story, which features 2 of Sterenko's most well known double-page spreads also features a strange right-hand page that does not appear in the original comic. This page (which precedes the spreads) features a reproduction of a later page and appears to have been dropped in randomly. This page unfortunatly creates a knock-on effect that means the 2 spreads are now right and left pages! For a book that claims to celebrate the best comics created this is a poor oversight. Also, the Dan Clowes story features 2 pages out of order. Lastly, why on earth is 95% of the book in black and white? For stories like The Dark Knight Returns and Watchmen - where the colour really helps add tone and mood - this seems like a strange decision."
3,The independent publishers are ignored.,"We can at least hope that the errors will be corrected in the paperback. An even more serious omission in the book is that it totally ignores such major artists as Dave Sim, Wendy and Richard Pini, Jimmy Gownley, Phil Foglio, and Jeff Smith."
2,Missing page(s),"This book looks great and my initial expectations were high. However, imagine my disappointment when I discovered the last page of the Fat Freddy's Cat adventure (page 30) was a duplicate of an earlier one (page 26)! I expected better proofreading from a Smithsonian publication."
1,Now I am Depressed!,"A year ago, my partner and I started the process of getting pregnant- we bought all the books we could find, did tons of research and, miraculously, we are due in three weeks. This book did nothing but scare us into believing that hospitals hate you, your sex life is over for good, and that lesbian parenting is frought with more drama than we could handle. And while there was oodles of information on the conception side of things, (however vauge), there was little of substance on pregnancy, labor, and birth.... I am sad for all of you who have to rely on this book to get the facts on pregnancy."
2,Too Negative,We bought this book to provide us with guidance during conception. I found it to be way too negative. I highly preferred Rachel Pepper's book The Ultimate Guide to Pregnancy for Lesbians.
4,Good book,"Book definitely has an opinion, even so it offered a nice perspective. It felt slightly out of step with today's reality, but maybe just out of step with mine. However, it does offer an alternative view to things that I think is very helpful."
5,much needed info,this is information that is greatly needed. i appreciated all the charts and advice that i'd never heard before. this book has become my handbook in a very short time.the book is so comprehensive and a true gift from the authors - it absolutely amazes me.
4,Cal State Hayward Student,"Used as a textbook for MPA program. Good overview of PA theories and preconceptions. Does not address the need to deconstruct social norms to focus on desired outcomes. Theory and studies are reviewed in this textbook. The chapters are short and sufficient). However, it is not completely thorough and detailed.Will I keep it as a resource - probably.Will I use it in the future (in daily practice) - probably not."
2,More is better.,This movie did not really tell the story as I had read about it. I felt they left out too much.
4,;0),This wasnt a bad movie but such tragic ending for both brothers money can not buy you happiness. After watching the movie I went online to research the headlines. Back to the movie both others and their family it was like a roller coaster from the time they met their wires to the end very watchable and engaging. The last brother who died John Stamos character I think still not sure about his death don't want to give touch away but I think it was for the insurance you'll see in the end.
3,shocking,Good movie mostly because I like John Stamos but it didn't go into much detail of the wife's relationship with the spouses before the killings. I didn't like the narrations by the women instead of playing it out.
4,Really a great light weight for older folks!,"Really a big help for our yard work..Very light weight and easy to handle around our hilly yard.. Used for mulch, moving stones for gardens etc..A very good value!"
1,Beware!,"Like another reviewer here, this charger blew the fuse in my car. It's also very cheaply and shoddily constructed. Stay very far away from this! It's not worth the hassle."
2,Broke after light use,Tip broke off after only a coupole of months of light use. I only plugged and unplugged it about 12 times in the months I had it. (I usually just kept it plugged in.) See uploaded picture by me.
1,Don't buy these for use on tile floors,"I needed sliders for my kitchen table which, due to space limitations, has to be moved almost daily. Unfortunately, instead of making the job easier, they make it harder. Maybe they would work better on carpeted areas. I wish the descriptions would be a little more specific."
3,Content but not impressed,"The large sliders are big enough to move most large pieces of furniture. I tried to move a couch and the couch would slide off the sliders. It seems the sliders work better with heavier pieces of furniture that won't slide off the sliders. It's also important to keep enough weight on the sliders so they don't slide off. I've used sliders that worked better than these, but they also cost more. All in all I'm satisfied but wasn't impressed."
2,Rough Slide,A little disappointed. These furniture sliders did not glide across the floor or carpet as they should have. In the past I have purchased similar product sold by another distributor. My furniture moved across the carpet and hardwood floors with the greatest of ease. With this product you will need help pushing your furniture or at least put more muscle into it to moving it. I should have purchased from previous distributor.
2,Too flimsy for moving heavy furniture on carpeting,"This is not made of heavy, non-bendable plastic, so using the large ones for heavy furniture over carpeting is a pain, as they bend and cause friction with the carpet. Best to use these on non-scratchable, hard surfaces. If you want to move heavy furniture over carpeting easily, fork over the few extra dollars for the better ones."
5,saved money,I recently bought a 24 inch wood planer and went to go pick it up with my truck and my sliders. I would had to yent a fork lift at a cost of several hundred dollars but I had a wench on the back of my truck so after I got the sliders under the machine {which weighted 3500 lbs) it slid rigtt on Thanks
2,Not worth the money.,"Cheap knockoffs of original style first sold on QVC. Plastic is thin and does not slide smoothly on carpet even with fairly light objects. Other brand ""as shown on TV"" also poor quality. Glue dries out and foam pad separates leaving them useless."
2,what you get,"This is what the product is: Cheap piece a plastic base with a rubber non-slip piece on top. Put product under cabinet, cabinet didnt slide any easier than without slider. Should have known better, ""as seen on tv"" products are junk, have never been please with thier products. Feel like dummy for buying it."
1,Sent the wrong color and style.,The graphic shows black rubber on white sextagonal plastic. The ones that came were orange plastic on round white bases.
3,needs lifter,big sliders are great but you still have to get one under the object.. need the lifter.. small gliders are rather useless..
2,Less than amazing,"These sliders as less than ""amazing"" due to the fact that, contrary to claims, they slide, especially on a wood floor. They are really only suitable for rugs."
1,Junk,Does not work like they show on TV. Might work on hardwood floors but it doesn't state it is for hardwood floors only. I say save your money
1,Will destroy hardware floors,"Well, the only thing amazing is how quickly you will be calling someone to refinish your hardware floors. The box says right on it, great for floors, tile and carpet. There are even two big pictures on the back of the box showing people using them on hardware floors. DO NOT USE on hardwood floors. I made the mistake of trying to move a dresser across a hardwood floor with these sliders. Despite the floor being recently washed and waxed and cleaned with a vacuum prior to moving the dresser, some grit (maybe from the bottom of my shoes) was on the floor and stuck to the bottom of these plastic disks (that's all they basically are) and put several scuffs and scratches in the floor. I purchased another type that has a soft covers for the bottom of the disks made of a fleece like material and they work very well. So while these might be ok for carpet, I would not use them on hardwood or tile for that matter."
2,Doesn't glide easier,"It helps protect your floor from scratches, that's about it. It doesn't make pushing heavy objects much easier. I wouldn't buy this again."
2,OVER PRICED,"I purchased this product and its alright. It still is hard to move heavy furniture, but it does make it a little easier. I rated it low bc I saw it for less then 5 bucks in a few stores and I paid over 10! :("
4,Not bad!,"Have moved furniture from one room to another with these a few times with good success, though they sometimes slide out from under the furniture while moving."
2,Cheap product,I have been cautious of ordering things that are tv advertised but I did not follow my own rules. These things are cheap and don't work. The minute you change surface types they slide off. A piece of cardboard will do just as well
3,Furniture sliders,"The four large sliders are great for moving furniture; however, the four smaller sliders are too small for anything. They slip out from under the furniture. The package should include eight larger sliders so that you can leave them under the furniture when you changing a room around. Moving them from one piece of the furniture to another and then back again involves a lot of lifting."
1,Just too flimsy for heavy things,"These are plastic discs with a foam rubber top. The foam rubber is supposed to keep whatever you are moving from slipping off the disc, but we found moving some basic office furniture that the plastic disc was too thin, and would warp, bend and snag on the carpet. Keep in mind this is building carpet, has no pad, no texture. We found that using cardboard squares cut from cardboard boxes worked better than these things."
5,Works as advertised,"I purchased these after using a neighbor's set. They work great on rugs, and make heavy things easy to slide. Sometimes they popped out from under the furniture when going over a lip in the floor, but they were easy enough to replace, and saved my poor back from getting too strained."
5,Back saving Sliders,"These are great. I have already used them a few times. Would recomend them. The only problem i have is remembering to use them more! I am so used to struggleing with furniture, but then remember I got these sliders and it is easy going from then."
5,"Love, love, love this product.","Love, love, love this product (plastic furniture sliders). As a single ""senior"" woman it is like having a partner to help me move heavy objects. Pleased with speed of receipt. Shipping costs were outrageous, however was unable to find it cheaper elsewhere"
3,Carpet only,I expected to use these on a wood floor. I don't believe plastic will slide on a wood floor without scratching. They work great on carpet.
1,These do NOT work at ALL,"I have used sliders for awhile now, so I decided to get more for furniture. These are cheap knock offs, and they did not slide on smooth carpet at all. The furniture just slid right off of the ""non-slip"" surface. Do not buy."
2,Don't slide that well,"I am using theses under a sewing machine table on a berber style rug, They don't slide easily but better than the table alone.I think the rug even though not thick is more than these can handle."
1,"Worthless, Too Flimsy",I could not use these for even the smallest of furniture items. I have returned them and found a better product.
1,Amazing Sliders,"My dad has the Waxman (as seen on tv), I used those and decided to buy some since they make life so much easier. These are NOT the same thing. These do NOT work at all. I used them under a granite/wood coffee table and every time I move it they pop right out from under. Don't waste your money. Spend the extra $5 for the real deal."
5,Memories,"I bought this item as a Christmas present for my grandson, age 9. I had taken Will and his older brother to an air show in Portsmouth, NH, where Will had his picture taken in front of a yellow biplane. Since he has become very interested in woodworking projects, I thought it would be a good learning experience as well as a memento of a memorable day together. I added some glue, yellow paint,some paint brushes and the picture. The kit is everything as advertised and more."
5,Canadian cowboy sings as great as ever,Glad I got another of Ian's DVD's. Made a great Christmas present for the man who introduced me to this singer. Tyson is getting a lot of well deserved publicity -- was on the cover of The Cowboy Way this month. Can't say enough good about this DVD -- it's really great!
2,Songs From the Gravel Road,"I bought the Disk for a couple of songs, so shouldn't be too disappointed. However, overall this compilation is not even close to the standard set by some of Tyson's earlier work. Perhaps, that is due to the fact that I am one of those who listens to the western/folk ballad's who doesn't find much satisfaction in the more raucous country style that was used on several of the songs on this release. The insertion of a marginal female vocalist to sing Range Delivery just added insult to injury. There was no indication that this release would be such a departure from the usual."
2,not quite there,Listening to this cd made me think of when I went to his dance in Elko and he couldn't keep a beat going with his band so they had to get Shelley and Kelly to finish the dance. 2 years before this dance was just great. The cds are following the same pattern. None of these songs hold a candle to Sweethearts Delight.
2,Not Ian's good cowboy music anymore,I have many many cd's and cassettes of Ian Tyson and his with Sylvia as well. This is not the good cowboy music as he has done previously. If you want a new sound with brass and sythysizer style music buy this. If you are interested in Ian's signature sound of his cowboy music don't.
2,KLP-Ian,We were disappointed with the type of music on this CD. We have Ian Tyson previous CD's and just did not care for the music on this one.
2,Lacks what he has previously produced.,"Mr Tyson has missed the train on this album.Call it hurried, rushed or just lacking - but this CD seriously lacks the flow and appeal of his previous work. Lost Herd it is NOT. Soemthing is missing...The shameful issue is he is capable of better, and his previous albums reflect it. Sadly, this CD relects a tad bit of Canadian Anti-American zest. Too bad, he should use his time and energy to his advantage - by producing a better album. I always looked forward to his music for what it was - unopinionated, true cowboy - not political...all thing change I guess.Buy it if you must...if for nothing else to have an anchor or bottom of your CD collection. Guaranteed to gather dust."
1,Another miss by a great singer,"As much as I want to like this CD, I just don't. As with ""Lost Herd,"" Ian has put out a CD so bland, mellow, and listless that I haven't bothered to listen to it after the first three tries. I know that nothing can compare to ""Cowboyography""--Ian's best album and one of my top five country-Western CD's ever--but I still expect a lot better than Ian's last two albums. Even ""Live at Longview"" missed the mark, containing few of his fabulous country songs from his earlier albums. I know Ian's up there in age now, but damn, I wish he'd do more songs like those from ""Cowboyography"" and ""And Stood There Amazed"" and ""Old Corrals And Sagebrush."""
5,I have eaten EVERYTHING in this book!,"As a son of one of the authors I grew up eating and testing everything in this book! Believe me, if you want to eat really well, BUY THIS BOOK!"
5,Convience food at its best!,"I have used the 1980 edition of this book for years and bought copies for all my daughters. I highly recommend it. I especially love the Mexican meat mix for chimichangas. I was happy to see the new 1995 edition which I got from the library , but noticed the pages falling out which is very unpleasant. I have just ordered the 2006 edition which hopefully will have better binding. However, if not Kinko's can spiral bind it, which is usually better for a cookbook anyway."
5,Great for those with allergies,"My husband has allergies to just about every preservative, artificial flavoring, artificial coloring, and any other food additive on the market. All the stuff you really shouldn't eat anyway. I cook from scratch mostly, and this book has been a wonderful addition to my kitchen.Last night I made the chocolate syrup; almost all the chocolate syrups on the market have artificial flavorings. My family loves the chocolate pudding from scratch (just three ingredients -- did you ever look at a pudding mix box?), and my kids are so used to tasting my home-cooked meals that they think the processed meals are gross.The money we save is great, but the time I save in the kitchen is even better. I highly recommend this book."
4,Practical and useful,More than I expected from the book. Great tips to have mixes ready for express cooking. Woderful recipes from entrees to deserts
1,Formatting errors in my Kindle edition.,"I owned the paperback version of this cookbook, and enjoyed it. The cookbook itself is very good, I'd give it five stars for the way it helps me save money, and the way it helps me have meals ready to go on those days when I might otherwise settle for unhealthy expensive take out or fast food meals.But the Kindle edition has formatting errors. In one or two of the later chapters, the pages are all mixed up. I don't mind because I used to have the paperback copy, but to those who have not had this cookbook before, it mightbe very confusing. So I have to give this a low rating, hopefully they give it a better proof read and editing job and re-issue the electronic version. I but a lot of cookbooks, many of them have formatting errors, but this is the worst I've seen."
5,Make-a Mix cook book,This was a cook book that I had previously owned & lost. I was thrilled to find it on Amazon. It arrived in a timely manner & was exactly what I ordered.
3,Pleased so far...,"I'm really excited about this book! So far all the recipes I've made have been great, with the exception of one - the Brownie Mix. The recipe does not call for any liquid, is this a misprint? It was crumbly - not even close to 'pouring' consistency.I'm looking forward to making more of the mixes & hoping someone can help me out with the brownie recipe!"
5,Wonderful cookbook,I was hesitant about buying this. I have a thing about being able to leaf through a book before buying it but it turned out to be great. The recipes are realistic...not an extreme number of ingredients. The recipe titles are an accurate representation of the end result. I have several friends who are working professionals w/ kids & it was nice to use some of the recipes in here in gift baskets for them.
3,Not a Stand Alone Story,This story doesn't work if you haven't read the novel Hardwired. It's best thought of as an epilogue to Hardwired. It's a very dark epilogue to that novel. It makes sense though and it is a logical result of the events in that novel.
3,Classic Roger Corman,"Although Roger didn't direct this film he produced it--and its 100% pure Corman. It moves along swiftly, has action, violence, partial nudity and ambigous moral themes (renegade cop, kind-hearted hooker etc).Corman's brilliance is in taking what's really a drive-in movie and incorporating themes that make it sound like an ""important"" film every teenager should see.None of this is to say its bad; when a young Christina Applegate says ""I know how to have sex but I don't know how to make love!"" I mean, wow, can life get any better?"
2,Not a quality product,This is the first time that I've ordered from a vendor on Amazon that did not meet my explectations. The tape was jumpy and I could not adjust the tracking enough to watch
3,Picture doesn't match the product.,"I carefully scrutinized the picture to ensure it was the product I wanted. The picture shows a clear Lexmark packaging and a product with Lexmark markings and attributes. The items received were in a generic box with generic markings. The product appears to work the same as the 'original'... however, I clearly feel decieved by the picture v. actual product."
5,I loved it~,"I loved this story. Heroine moves to South Africa to be with her brother and his wife and the rich neighbor takes a shine to her, but she can't stand him. He ends up saving her life and the tables turn, she starts to see him in a different light. But the plot thickens when a beautiful ""jilted"" woman shows up in town. A nice read. It will go on my ""keepers"" shelf to be re-read."
1,Magic the Gathering Interactive Encyclopedia,"This software should still be in beta testing. Even with the patches it constantly crashes and has errors. When I asked for tech support with the second patch, they say to uninstall the program and NOT install the second patch. The game is great, but the programmers and tech support people should be fired!!"
4,Were Are They All????????????????????,Why is everything I want (this prouduct included)at Amazon.com out of stock. You would think that a site that sells so much would not be able to sell so much without keeping the items in stock(could sell much more and make much more if they did; hint hint) My rating of the game is not accurated because I don't have it because it is out of stock!!! HINT HINT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,A MUST FOR ANY MAGIC PLAYER!,This is a must for any magic player! I have been waiting for this for soooooooo long. I don't need to have those paper version of magic encyclopedia any more! GO GET IT NOW!
1,"Love the Card Game, Hate the software","I love the card game but have little time to play. So I purchased the game to play online. I have had nothing but problems getting the game to work. The tech support is no existant and the patches dont help. This is very frustrating. I can recommend the card game, but not this defective software"
4,I think the game is a fun way to get to know all the cards,This game will let you know what all the cards are and let you see them all you can also play with any of the cards you want. It will get you to where you know all the cards and you can tell all your friends whats what.
5,I passed the test,"I hate those Saturday tests. I hate studying for those Saturday tests. I found a book that made this one much easier. When I found out I had to take an Arizona Constitution test to get certified I found the constitution on the internet and tried to read it. Sorry, but I'm not a lawyer. Then I found this book. Easy to read, hits the high points. The practice test was very helpful. And... I PASSED THE TEST!"
4,The Arizona Constitution Study Guide,This item was shipped quickly and it was new. It was packaged great and didn't have any marks on it. I would have liked to know before I ordered it just what it intailed as to the book but otherwise great. I would buy from again
5,Great Replacement,I have a 2005 Troy-Bilt bronco and it was time to replace everything. Blades went on easy and cut great
4,it's about time,I don't always agree with his likes and dislikes in movies but I admire his writing and arguments/critique. His writing style is simple yet witty and caustic.
1,disappointing!,This movie is so disappointing. I understand they had to adapt it but why all the changes? The changes made the movie more confusing and unbelievable. Don't waste your money on this.
1,Horrible! Horrible! Horrible!,"This film should never have seen the light of day. It is a slap in the face to Mr. Collins' original work. The director obviously tried (and failed) to out do the author. Bring back the BBC television mini-series from the early 1980's. This other version not only was well acted, but remained faithful to the plot and spirit of the novel."
1,Total Trash,"Whatever you do, do NOT buy this horrid re-writing of Collin's book. The only way you are going to enjoy it is if you have not read the novel and are don't care to ever let your eyes fall on the printed page. Once you get into the book, the pages will fly you will be so engrossed. I know that film needs to take liberties with stories, but this was an assassination of what is considered one of the first mystery novels. It does not follow either the spirit or the story of the original for which I can find no possible excuse. Two hours is plenty of time to bring out the best Collins has to offer. Too bad that such a good cast was used to no real meaningful purpose. I am so glad I borrowed it from my local library. I can't wait to return it tomorrow."
1,Most Horrible Adaption,"I decided to give this movie a chance after reading some of the reviews. Now, I only wish that I had paid more attention to the right reviewers instead of the wrong ones. I'm amazed that the film maker had the audacity to even call this movie WOMAN IN WHITE! If you love the following movie adaptions: BBC's newest Pride and Prejudice, Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility, Wives and Daughters, Middlemarch, Our Mutual Friend... and have read Mr. Collins' original story, TRY TO AVOID THIS MOVIE! It's worse than you could imagine! Don't end up feeling sorry as I do now."
5,Great Masterpeice Theater film,"I really love this movie. Masterpeice Theater did a great take on a great Wilke Colins novel. I especially love the commentary before and after the movie. It gives you a well rounded view. For only having 2 hours to cover a novel that could easily have made a 5 hour movie, I say ""Well done!"""
2,pietrp 2,A low rate because of the lack of the subtitles who helps to undestand foreign people not so accustomed with spoken english
3,The WRONG WOMAN IN WHITE,"I HAVE NOT SEEN THIS VERSION, SOI DO NOT KNOW IF IT'S GOOD OR NOT.SOME PEOPLE MENTION BBC PRODUCTION.THE ONLY VERSION I'VE SEEN IS THE ONEWITH ALEXIS SMITH, ELANOR POWELL, SIDNEYGREENSTREET. I CAN'T FIND THIS VERSION ANYWHERE.TOO BAD BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THE BEST MOVIESI'VE EVER SEEN. DATED BUT EXTREMELY ENTERTAINING."
1,A great disappointment,"This is truly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. After loving the book I was greatly disappointed to find that they had done little else to keep the spirit of the book other than the title and character names. Practically every character's personality was completely changed, along with the fact of there being nothing to show that there was an attempt to even try to include the same or similar scenes in the transition from book to movie.Some of this would be forgiveable if the plot and characters they introduced in it's stead were somewhat interesting. Please do yourself a favor and read the book which is far superior."
1,Stay away if you love the book,"If you're a fan of Wilkie Collins' Victorian-noir novel, Woman in White, you will be sorely disappointed by this inferior, very modern, rip-off of his work. Basically, all the director did here was keep the title and go off and make his own politically correct, feminist version which he must have thought would resonate more with modern audiences. This was totally unnecessary, since the character of Marian Halcomb was one of the strongest female characters in Victorian fiction and really the heart and soul of the novel. But subtlety is not one of director Fywell's strong points. Even the plot has been perverted in this version and Sir Percival's secret now revolves around sexual abuse of the Anne Catherick and not the coverup of his illegitmate birth. This version is inferior in every way to the BBC version produced in the mid-80's starring Diana Quick. Avoid it."
5,Jane Austen Meets Wilkie Collins,"Tara Fitzgerald is a classic heroine. Wilkie Collins the perfect venue for this superb actress. The Woman in White contains elements of Victorian Times and Hitchcockian mystery, with enough twists and turns to keep any viewer glued to the set. A classic statement of women rising above their permitted station and triumphing in the end. Beautifully written, acted, and filmed, this video will be a favorite you will watch again and again."
3,In all honesty....,"I, unfortunately, viewed the movie before I read the book, and I loved it. However, after I read the book, I realized how completely different the two plots actually were. My advice: Collins' did not intend for the story to be taken as it was in the movie, but that doesn't mean that the movie wasn't good! Change the title and the characters' names, perhaps, and make it a completely different thing... it was a great book, and a good movie."
1,NOT like the book,"If you are buying this as ""a movie,"" it will be OK, not more. But if you are considering getting this because you think the book is extraordinarily amazing (as I do) and would like to ""see"" the book, well, think again. This ""adaptation"" is hardly that--the entire story line is totally different from the book, making it unique and not worthy to have been called ""The Woman in White."" I would call it ""vaguely based on the book."" Mr. Collins is cringing in his grave."
1,woman in white,"this was an awful re-make and I was surprised at PBS! BBC production was wonderful and I that is the one I'm looking for. The story was very poorly adapted, as well as the cast was dead."
5,Lovely Book - Powerful Essences,The Bush Flower Essences are among my favorites. This is a wonderfully written flower essence book. The repertory is well organized and easy to use.Highly recommended!
5,a wonderful addition to my fall out boy collection,"Love this CD!Considering that this is a split EP and only 3 of the 6 songs included are by Fall Out Boy, it may not be for everyone."
5,KNOW YOUR HISTORY,"This is a wonderful film with honest and true stories. Every young Gay person would find this film enlightening and fascinating. I had forgotten myself the stories of my contemporaries. Although my partner and I received more than 6,000 letters of support when we obtained a marriage license in Minnesota in 1970, I had not read the words of people from all over the world who supported us and wished us well until this year. This film was a reminder of the words that those letters conveyed to us of love, support and admiration for our courage. What this film told me was that millions of Gay people all over the world suffered great pain, loneliness, and fear, just to find someone whom they could love and who would love them for who they were. A powerful film with true lives and messages for future generations."
5,Excellent camera,"I have owned my PD170 for about a year now. I bought it to replace my VX2000 (another great camera).Pros:1. Excellent quality images for a non HD camera.2. XLR connectors.3. Compact size with excellent weight for steady one handed shots.4. The low light ability of this camera is second to none.5. Professional look.Cons:1. Not a shoulder mounted camera.I shoot mostly weddings, events and indoor theatre productions.You can't go wrong with this video camera."
1,Max nora jones,Thought this cd was all songs when I bought it. If i knew what it was I would not buy.
2,Too Narrow,I tried to wear these shows for a while but theu are way too narrow for my foot. Have given them to Goodwill.
5,A beautiful book,"""Racing My Father"" by Patrick Smithwick is a book I loved. His writing style has what I experience as a kind of poetic freedom where he leaps forward by a slight change in subject in mid paragraph, a style I felt excited by. Equally as important I love the depth and breath of the content that so vividly brings out the character of the individuals and the unique culture of the steeplechase community. Most moving is the hero worship of a child being carried in the wake of a living legend, a child lost in the limelight always wanting more love and less light. This book speaks to the struggle of so many young boys and girls whose parent is made a legend whether in a large arena or a small village. It is so hard to feel OK when the bar is set at a mythological level. Frequently this book moved me to tears.My brother died at a young age, and I'm sending a copy of this beautiful book to each of his two sons."
4,"Great memoir, by turns moving and exciting; puts the reader in the ""rider's seat.""","I purchased this book for several reasons, including the fact that I had worked for the author's Uncle Mikey back in the 70s. The carefully detailed imagery and character profiles took me way beyond the personal connection, however. I found the author's transformations and decision-making processes both familiar and instructive. He does himself and his father proud with this tribute and the way he has proceeded in life.I consider this one of the better memoirs (and this is my favorite genre) I've read."
4,A descent keyboard combo,"This product works well, although a key did pop off. It was fairly easily repaired, but shouldn't have happened in the first place. Otherwise, works well. Nice having the 10-key pad."
1,spacebar sticks,"I would love this keyboard except for the spacebar, which sticks very badly. It installed easily-is sleek and comfortable-but is not usable for very long because of this glitch. I'm starting to see more reviews on this spacebar problem-so it looks to be fairly common with this model."
4,BEST KEYBOARD OUT THERE! ! !,"Only negative thing I could say about it is that, ""mouse"" feels little uncomfortable, because it might be small for allot of people as it is for me, but the keyboard is the best.. I've had allot of keyboards before this one but ""THIS ONE ROCKS""YOU WON""T REGRET <GET IT>IF PRICE IS EXPENSIVE FOR SOME OF YOU ""consider this"" YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY! ! !"
2,looks good but spotty functionality,I had to replace this after a few months because it began to act up and not type a key when depressed. The replacement does the same thing on the space bar ocassionally. I would not buy this item again. It is a clean design and looks nice. But I would prefer one that actually worked 100% of the time.
2,Great at first....poor quality over time,"The mouse is fine and the calculator is also fine (thus 2 stars instead of 1). I'll keep using those. The keyboard was great at first, then the space bar started getting finicky (after 3-4 months of daily use) and I'd have to hit it a couple of times to get it to work. Around the same time, keys started popping off under normal use and carrying the thing around in a knapsack. After reattaching the X key a few times with the help of a paperclip and lots of patience, I thought I had the hang of it. All seemed well. Then the R key came off today. A half hour of trying to put it back on knocked the E key off, and now the keyboard is in the garbage. Good riddance."
3,lets begin,"i love it. yet i dont. the only problem is the spacebar. which doesnt seem to respond when tapped, which in turn makes me look like a headless chicken when im typing really fast.yougetwhatimsaying?"
2,beautiful but.........,Keep your old keyboard and mouse handy. The diNovo works about 80% of the time. When it works its nice but you will have to switch to your old keyboard sometimes in mid document
3,A fun movie,"This is a guilty pleasure. Unfortunately, like many Paramount transfers, this is too soft and not vibrant; a real dissapointment (sometimes I would swear it is also out of focus...but that may be in the original masters)."
2,Opposing Exaggerations of the Worst Kind,"Gung Ho depicts the worst exaggerations of traits supposedly attributable to both Japanese corporate culture and American unionized labor and puts Michael Keaton in the middle of it -- I was not amused.What makes the film mildly interesting is the sympathy Keaton's character elicits from his predicament as he desperately tries to play cultural mediator; it might strike a chord with whomever has found himself in a similar position. George Wendt's character, however, is an insult to the American autoworker. Most of the premises are ""manufactured"" for conflict and cheap laughs, while the movie's culmination doesn't ring true in the least.With a smarter and more insightful script this could have been a comedy for the ages. As it is, it's ultimately an abject embarrassment."
3,Many past memories returned after seening this movie.,"After working ten years for a Japanese company, many memories came back as I watched this movie. Memories of many long hours, after work meetings that extended until bedtime, not being able to attend events with my family because ""I had to work"" and ""Only thinking of the company"". Ron Howard captures the Japanese work ethic very well in this movie."
4,Very Funny!,"The movie takes the situation, not improbable, of an overly efficient Japanese company taking over an American auto plant & the adjustments the workers must make to keep their jobs. The workers are pushed to the breaking point. Communication problems, many funny, impede progress. All coming to a predictable, but pleasing conclusion."
1,You're kidding about the price...RIGHT?,"$68 for this DVD!!! That's a typo, right? I mean Michael Keaton is a great actor and all but sixty eight bucks? Really?"
4,Working Class Man,"This movie was released in Australia as 'Working Class Man' and I believe that it even had the Jimmy Barnes hit dubbed into the sound track at the end of the movie.Thoroughly enjoyed the movie and encourage anyone who has not seen it to have a look and judge for themselves.From an Australian point of view, still too American, perhaps some fun made of the Japanese, but like I said, judge for yourselves."
4,Gung Ho is still a great movie today,"Being in the automotive industry working for one of the Big 3, I can relate to this movie. I also like Michael Keaton so in a way this was a no brainer for me. You can see the clash of American management culture versus Japanese management culture. Obviously they try to instill humor into the movie regarding seriuos topics and I enjoyed watching it and would watch it again."
5,Gung Ho about this movie!!,This is one of my favorite movies. Michael Keaton is top knotch funny in this movie and it keeps me laughing the whole time.
5,My Favorite Singer,"This is a wonderful album by my favorite singer. He can sing any style, but I enjoy his classical style the best. I'm glad he has recovered from his surgery and is back performing again. I hope he'll come to California some day for a concert."
5,Excellent,"I heard about Russell Watson on the aol welcome screen news items--in reference to the operation he recently went through. I went to his site and was captivated by his music. I love this cd, especially the song ""Barcelona."" His voice is magical. I highly recommend this cd."
2,Not as good...,"Initially it smells like a cheap cologne. It has two distinct scents...alcohol and the flavor you should smell. After 4 or so hours, the alcohol smell fades away and you start to smell good. Thus it deserves two stars!...mostly because of the price and quick shipping."
5,Subtle Scents for Subtle Gents,"Kenneth Cole Black is one of my favorite fragrances because it doesn't overpower the senses by drawing all the attention toward you. It has sweet, yet manly odor about it that doesn't cause an allergic reaction like some stronger colognes. Works for an everyday scent or for that hot date you want to notice you next Friday night."
3,Missing pieces,"The picture of this cologne shows a box and a lid. I ordered this as a Christmas present and it came with no lid and no box. I felt like I was giving a stolen item as a gift. The price was right, but I would only buy this if you are keeping it for yourself and not giving it to someone else."
3,Smells great while it lasts,"Maybe I received a dud, but this scent disappears on me within a half hour. I bought it directly from Amazon so tampering is unlikely. Most reviews seems overwhelmingly positive though, so my purchase may have just been a lemon."
4,Good for every day use,"Nice smell, lasts well I use it for everyday use. No one has complained about it being over powering. A few compliments. Fair price for a good product."
1,Smells Cheap,"Colognes vary with a person's chemistry, but to me, this stinks. Even though it cost somewhere around $30, it smelled like really cheap cologne that a clueless guy would overuse. Kenneth Cole Reaction is just a tiny step above this (but still stinks). Again, chemistry has an impact here, but this was my experience."
2,NOZZLE,"When I open the lid, the nozzle was stuck in it and came out, the tube broke and now it is hardly functional. On the other hand, items having flammable liquids cannot be returned to Amazon. However, it had a very nice smell after all!"
2,cologne is like water,"I've shopped for years, but I've never received something this bad. This cologne is like water, now am hesitant to buy anymore cologne. Will definitely not order any more, but still have to use until the stock runs out."
5,Kenneth Cole Black Cologne,Love it!! It got here super fast and is in perfect condition. It was packaged very well :) Thank you so much!!
4,in a box! phew,"I bought this for my boyfriend as one of his xmas gifts this year. With the cheap price and some of the reviews about it being a tester and arriving unboxed, I was EXTREMELY hesitant to purchase this but took the risk. It arrived in 2 days and to my relief, fully boxed! can't comment on how long the scent lasts because I wont know till after xmas. I have smelt the original in store though and boy was it goooddd!"
5,smell good,these smells that come from the juice smell so good. I feel like a mature man about to take a woman out
3,Great Price,"I ordered this for my husband for Christmas. The price was a lot less expensive than in the department stores however, I don't think the scent is as strong and it does not linger......a little disapointed."
4,Cologne,Good value for the amount of cologne. Buying in bulk is always cheaper. The scent of this cologne is almost as good as Polo Black or Polo Double Black.
3,Good product but a little shady,"I purchased this cologne on 11/1/2008 and though it does smell like Kenneth Cole Black and is more than likely genuine, the serial number was carved out of the bottom of the bottle. Other than that, the product is okay."
2,Wrong product,I tried ordering this product but I ended up receiving some nasty musk stuff instead. I was really disappointed. We like the Kenneth Cole stuff but the sender did a poor job of getting it to us. the refund was fast though.
3,Good fragrance but doesn't last too long,"I bought this as a gift for myself. I have always used this perfume and I thought this would be a nice gift at a little better price when compared to other retailers. This is my first time placing an order for perfumes from Amazon.com.The perfume fragrance is nice, which it has always been. But for some reason, the smell wouldn't last even couple hours which I suspect if Amazon receives a different product shipment from Manufacturers which is not the same as what Macys or any other retailers would receive for Fragrances. Since I have bought the same product from a different retailer in the past and the fragrance would last much longer, there is no other reason for me to doubt that Amazon's sells the same product but is not exactly comparable.I would never buy and would not recommend perfumes from Amazon in future. This is a great place to buy other stuff but not fragrances.Spend a little extra money to get the full worth of your hard earned $$."
1,Buyer Beware,"I ordered this fragance and when a received it, looks bad¡¡¡ the box are in bad condition and on the bottom of the bottle has a mark in the cristal ummmm looks to me its fake¡¡¡¡¡BEWARE"
2,my review,"Took long to receive and was not what I expected it was false advertising and did not meet my standards, I won't send it back"
3,30$ So its what it costs that whole big savings = lie,Product scent really goes away after around 3 hours. It smells amazing for 3 hours but man i wanna smell like that a lil bit longer but it dosen't so instead i'll need to shove fire ants inside my pooper. Hands down pizza taco del king. Ding a Ling. Ring Ring Ding Dong.
4,nice cologne,"Great scent, my husband loves it..and so do I. I will definitely be buying this one again. Try Kenneth Cole Black if you like CK colognes. Anyway it would make a great holiday gift!!"
5,"Modern, elegant, fresh - it has it all!","This is one of my all time favorite fragrances. It gives you a very modern, crisp, and refreshing scent that lasts a good while. I got a sample from a friend of mine, and went out and bought it the very next day. Great stuff!"
3,Great Service from Amazon,"The product arrived and the lid was faulty. The spray part would not come out and after being opened once the bottle refused to close. I logged on and attempted to return it but noted that colognes can't be returned. Highly irritated, I tried speaking to customer service using the live chat option. Within 10 minutes I had a response and was informed my replacement was on its way. Naturally I havn't received it yet, but assuming it arrives - BRILLIANT service from Amazon. Did make me a little concerned about the quality of the product though! Anywaz, smells good!"
5,Awsome scent!,This is an awsome scent! Buy this for my adult son and he always receives comments wanting to know what scent he's wearing. Fast delivery too. Thanks!!
5,Wonderful Scent!,"The first time my husband tried this scent, it was instantly his signature scent! Every time he wears it he gets compliments not just from women, but from men too! KC Black is not overpowering and stays with you all day long. It a very attractive scent with just a hint of musk. I would recommend this to any man who wants a sexy masculine scent!"
5,The best ever,"I love this product by Kenneth Cole and I have used it for years. It is my favorite cologne and to find it on Amazon at an awesome price, its just phenomenal. I recommend guys out there to give this product a shot. They won't be disappointed."
3,Comes on strong and leaves nicely,Not my favorite cologne. This definately has a strong spicy masculine smell. Some men may prefer it. I really wouldn't say an appropriate work cologne. Better for romance . Although like I said it has a strong smell. Very distinctive and outdoorsey. What i did notice is that after a few hours the scent becomes softer and more pleasant. I would not recommend this cologne unless you prefer the spicy scents.
4,Not great but good,Received this cologne years ago as a gift and liked it. It's not an extremely fancy cologne but is perfect for everyday use as it is not overpowering. Use it sometimes when going to work or just to hang out with some friends.
5,Purchased for adult son,"Smells very nice, this was a new scent for my son and he was happy with it. Fragrance lasts a long time."
3,Okay... seems like a knock-off,Bought from amazon directly. Good scent. Not very powerful and doesn't have staying power at all. I know I will be fortifying my Tommy Bahama scents before I think about buying any Kenneth Cole products again.
4,Lightweight and cheaper than Graco,"Great for travel; lightweight and folds up fairly compactly. We found it useful transferring from taxi to airport and back. It is a decent stroller for when you want the flexibility of having a car seat on travel, but I would not recommend it for day-to-day use."
4,so practical,"i never have to wake the baby up when he's asleep, just put the car-seat and go.. the only thing i did not like much is thal is a little weak, but i carry the baby there everywhere i go.."
3,disapointed,this is a beatiful stablemate but i was dissipointed because i thought it was a big breyer horse and when i got it it wasnt a breyer horse. but overall it has clean paint and a pretty pose
2,Not what I thought,I thought I would be getting a nice big heavy beach towel for this price. It is very thin and not really all that big. Poor value for the money.
1,deception is the key word........,"If you are looking for a book a long the lines of ""Blood and Money"" You won't find it in this book! I found this book very drawn out. It did not deliver! The author was very self serving. It was Money ($25.00) ill spent!"
5,Charlie's Angels Action Oriented Autobiography,"My book club found this author to be refreshingly creative in the way she wrote her autobiography. Instead of writing in third person, which most autobiographies are written, Sydney lays out her family mysteries in the style of a novel. It is written in present tense to engage readers into the hunt for the father's real will. It's a unique action oriented book filled with ups and downs and excitement. The dialogue reads very quickly. Some of the sisters' hilarious stunts to get to the truth reminded us of Charlie's Angels. My book club loved it."
4,Its the voice.....,"I bought this album after hearing Aled Jones on BBC's Songs of Praise. He really does have a powerful voice. Nothing fancy - just a really clear, defined voice that is seemingly perfect. And the songs, although traditional, are a healthy mix of new, old, loved and uknown. Try it out - its the sort of CD where you can put it on while in a traffic jam, ...and relax."
2,2.5 stars,Eh...this CD isn't spectacular. A lot of it is lo-fi production but clear enough to hear the lacking in instrumental execution. A lot of the songs are pretty monotonous too and consist of the same guitar riff being repeated throughout. Recommended for fans of Darkthrone (even though Darkthone's albums are a bit better) and raw black metal sounding music...If you're into symphonic/melodic black metal with crystal clear production...I'd stay far away from this.
3,pretty decent biographical recording,"I'm a little disappointed, I must say, I was expecting at least a song or 2 by the band somewhere on this recording. Instead I got a biography with lame techno-esc melodies between the over-worded chapters. The author makes the common biography mistake of seemingly elevating the subject (or subjects) to sainthood. Apparently, the highs are high and their lows were catastrophic. But all that aside, it's pretty informative and there are some nice quotes from the boys at the beginning of the sections; one of them by Stefan, who up until now, I wasn't sure could speak.I'd recommend it to any fans, but don't expect much."
1,a huge disappointment,"if you are goung to buy this, the most yoshould have to pay is $5.00. this cd only has a band interview and the beginning of each track, they only last 15 secs. the rest of it is a woman speaking about placebo. it seems she's read about 2 magazine articles on placebo, and is just restating it. this cd is of no use to someone who knows about placebo, if you know absolutely nothing about placebo then buy it."
2,Blah movie,"This could be a great movie for someone who likes the more Indie-type productions. I found the movie tedious and many times annoying. The pacing was a little slow for me, and it took me 3 tries to get past the first 15 minutes. I didn't like the faux documentary aspect. Some of the dialogue was hard to follow. On the plus side, I did find it had a kind of charming sense of humor at times, but those moments were too few to offset the negatives. I had to force myself to watch the whole thing and can't imagine trying to watch is again"
1,how this ever got distributed is beyond me,"As a film maker, video production camera man I have seen some senseless shallow production.This could have been a good documentary, but this cast and crew produced a cable access quality pr bestoduction at. it did show how shallow the current generation of production artists can be.it is two hours of my life i will not get back...what is with the need to show people smoking?"
3,Cute,"Cute movie, but I found myself getting a bit antsy after a while. The actors are fine, but I worry about the future of the now greatly overexposed Michael Cera. He's good, but too one note to play this gig so often and for very much longer."
2,just ok,"Paper Heart, could not decide whether to be a story or a reality show. For this reason I give it a total thumbs down. I would give it more if all the people in the film were told that they were the subject matter of the film. I felt it was very deceitful and just did not like it for that reason."
2,Not (and it does pretend to be) a documentary,"Cute, whimsical, clever--especially the paper doll puppet parts--but false.So this is categorized as a ""hybrid documentary""? What is next: hybrid truth?"
4,Paper Heart DVD,"I bought this for my husband's birthday. He saw the trailer on another DVD that we were watching. The item arrived new and on time based on the shipping information. It was a fun DVD, cute and well made for what it is (mockumentary). The ending was a little disappointing though."
3,Did' Quite Get it,"I know this was suppose to be a documentary, but I was lost, and it left me cold. Three stars for effort."
3,Cute movie but odd setup,"i did have trouble with the classification of this movie. I know some say it is a pseudo documentary and should be appreciated for that but it made the movie a bit awkward to watch. It was a cute love story and you get to see how the relationship develops and the problems with making the movie while forming the relationship. So, the same thing that makes it awkward also makes it interesting. Satisfies our voyeur tendencies for reality but just a little odd having it in a movie. But still a cute romance."
1,Paper Flat,"I really wanted to like this movie, as it looked cute. It's Yi interviewing various couples interspersed with her own adventure in love. But after watching two-thirds of it, I gave up. There are a couple of funny bits but the whole thing feels flat - I couldn't care about Yi at all. She's just flat and boring and lifeless, barely a person at all. So what if she doesn't believe in love? I didn't believe in her character.Paper heart? Paper thin."
2,Please enter a title for your review:,"i figured the girl came up with this concept and set out to make this documentary, she must have a brain in her head she must have something to say, but by the halfway point it was like ok she's a complete moron and i don't care about anything she has to say about anything and every word she speaks is like a nail in my skull."
2,As Much a Documentary as I'm a Pumpkin,"Ok so the movie is, as many others have already mentioned, a hybrid documentary.Which effectively means it's not a documentary at all but rather a story based on real events... wait a second... aren't many Hollywood stories based on real events? Does that mean... there are hybrid documentaries everywhere! I guess the other marketing agents decided not to try and mislead the viewers though.It's not even that good. Cera is alright considering how the movie plays out but I found Yi to be somewhat annoying, the story lacking a certain something that makes it really stick in your mind, and in general found the humor in it to be empty and just generally hollow."
1,What is this? Zero Stars,"This movie was certainly not what I was expecting. The budget of this film probably would have been a record low if there weren't any overpaid semi-stars hidding throughout it to keep it up. The movie was super boring and personally I found it annoying. I wanted to give it a chance, but when my girlfriend even asks me to turn it off you know it's bad. I think I was able to watch a total of about 15 - 20 mins of it, I'm not sure though - I think watching paint dry might have held my attention better (and maybe longer!)"
1,"This ""movie"" should have NEVER been made!","I love Michael Cera, but barely made it through the first half hour of this ""mockumentary""...I don't really know if that term is appropriate because there is no humor...and for that matter, no point in this film. The fake love-life story of Charlyne is crazy boring and awkward in the uncomfortable way, not the entertaining way. I rented from red Box and am seriously upset about the one dollar that I wasted on it...it is that bad."
3,Pleasantly Entertaining,"This faux documentary was nice a story to watch, but didn't leave a lasting impression. While I enjoyed it, there aren't many people I know I could recommend it to because it doesn't cater to a very wide crowd.Which is weird because the topic is LOVE, but the presentation is too art-house for about 95% of the people I know.That said it had its charms with comically and painfully awkward lead Charlyne Yi, and ever-droll Michael Cera.The highlight of the entire movie was the funny little paper side tales presented. I supposed these help inform the title.Overall, if you're into quirky, art-house, faux documentary films about love (ie your a college freshman majoring in liberal arts) you'll probably enjoy this flick"
3,"Charming, clever, cute, but at times confusing...","Charlene Yi is the lead in this mockumentary about love. I found it charming when they showed everyday people talking about love and relationships. As this film about making a film unfolds, Yi develops a relationship with Michael Cera.Since both actors play themselves, it became sort of confusing. Was this a real relationship? Or was it a gentler attempt at Andy Kaufmanesque/Borat type ""reality humor"", i.e. ""I'm serious, but I'm funny. Just kidding! No, I'm really serious...or am I?"" By the end of the movie, I was questioning whether the heartfelt interviews with everyday people were real or scripted. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it enough to give it 3 stars.I'm a fan of Michael Cera's, and would like to see more of Charlene Yi's work. Seth Rogen has one or two very brief scenes.I can recommend this movie as a rental, but I'm not sure it stands up to repeated viewings."
1,Boring...and I'm a fan of the genre and Cera,"The faux doc style can be done well and be quite enjoyable. I am also a big fan of Michael Cera and find him so funny in fact that I can enjoy not very good films like Year One just because I find his delivery and persona so comical. I had such high hopes I almost bought this on blu ray site unseen. This film however lacks on so many levels that it simply didn't work for me. You may be able to enjoy a film with no coheret story line. Maybe you can enjoy one with stiff and wooden acting by it's lead. Movie don't have to be a laugh a minute funny, nor do they have to touch you with drama you can relate to. There can be a weak or uninteresting arc. Still, *some* degree of *some* of this would help it be entertaining. I found nothing to like here. I wacthed the film with my teen daugthers and they too were equally disappointed. I found myself just waiting for it to be over and thought seriously of shutting it off."
2,Mockumentary or not: It's dull.,"Folks are getting really bent out of shape about the ""classification"" of this film. Personally, ""hybrid documentary"" to me, means: mockumentary. The story can be based on real events or have a bunch of ad-libbed lines all it wants, but once you see professional actors playing roles in the film: it's not a documentary!That aside, the movie is dull. The plot is a decent idea, but the set-up takes far too long. And then once we get to the ""juicy"" part of the story, it's really not all that juicy after all: these two socially awkward characters never stop being awkward. For me, the characters simply came off as shallow and annoying.If you're looking for a good Michael Cera flick, watch ""Nick & Nora's Infinite Playlist."" Looking for a good mockumentary; try ""Waiting for Guffman."" Looking for a reason to demand 1.5 hours of your life back; this is your movie!"
1,Just Bloody Awful,"First off, the writer/star of this mess, is she a comedian? Really?! I'm missing something here. I must not be on the same planet as those who highly rated this movie. Her ""act"" is truly abysmal. My two teenage kids are funnier than her (and they're not that funny!). How does she have such cool friends who are willing to make this movie with her?? Her expressions throughout are painful to watch! I haven't seen anything that grated on my nerves this much since ""License to Wed"". Apparently others see more beneath the surface of this smug, unfunny ""mock-doc"". I'm here to warn you...there's nothing profound here. Just some self-involved movie makers with a camera. If you find this one to your taste, please explain it to me!"
2,I lost another 85 minutes of my life,"What's the point of this film? A girl trying to find out the meaning of love and pretending it's a documentary. So what. I think Charlyne Yi is the only thing decent about Paper Heart. She is funny in an adorable kind of way, but even her ""performance"" wears thin over 85 minutes. The movie description didn't really interest me, so I knew I was taking a chance going in. I was hoping for a nice surprise and I ended up just waiting for it to be over. It's not all bad, but the good moments are few and very far between. Oh, Michael Cera in real life acts the same as M.C. in every movie he does. What a range."
1,Sucks,"By far one of the most pointless, lame, boring pieces of film I've ever seen. We suffered through about 40 minutes of this mess before hitting the eject button on the DVD. Regardless of whatever concept/technique was employed, it's just awful. Even the talented Michael Cera couldn't save it."
3,SLANG BOOK,"This is almost a Slang Dictionary, which you can find funny and FUN info regarding the German Slang. If you love to use colloquial language and slang in your conversations, this book will help you out.I was very satisfied with this book, since it gave me ""precious"" info on a parallel terminology I wouldn't find anywhere else!"
5,Funny as all get out!,I am studying German and using a proper textbook to do so as well as the Pimsleur CDs. Of course sometimes this can get a little tedious and dry. So to have this book brings humor and levity to learning the German language. It is quite funny and entertaining. I would refrain from actually using some of the words when in Germany though.
1,Ripped off,"I ordered this generator before hurricane Sandy arrived. It was not going to arrive in time so the next day i attempted to cancel the order. I was emailed by Amazon stating this could not be canceled. However, I was welcome to refuse the order which I did. Fed ex has confirmed this item was returned back to the shipper and signed for on November 5th. There has been zero contact or refund to my credit card. I have tried every way possible to try and contact someone at amazon but have gotten no reply and now the item shows as a non returnable item. Now I have no generator and am out over $350 bucks!!!! What a rip off. I plan to dispute this with the credit card company."
2,Arrived damaged,The generator arrived at my home with a broken On-Off switch. I called the help line and they sent a replacement switch which I replaced with some difficulty.Th generator works fine now.
1,Damaged machine,I ordered this generator on sale at Amazon. It came with free shipping. Well you get what you pay for. When I received it the bottom of the box was open and some of the paperwork was missing as well as the entire frame of the machine being bent out of shape. When I called buffalo tools about it the technician suggested beating it back into shape with a hammer. He was serious. Apparently this is a common problem because he told me where it was bent! When I indicated this might cause further damage I was told to take it to a local repair shop. Well I ordered it around thanksgiving and we are getting close to Christmas and its still in the shop. It has never even been started. This machine needs better packaging for starters. I will write another review when it actually is used.
1,Questionable,"Even though I was not familiar with the brand I ordered it because the price, when it arrived the first thing I noticed was a loose bolt and missing nut on one of the rubber shock absorbers, the second was a broken spark plug cap. After receiving the replacement parts and installing them, and putting gas in it, it leaked at the bottom of the tank, not as a drip but as a stream. Contacted Buffalo Tools, a few days later, they told me that they had not been able to secure a service center in my area willing to deal with this Chinese engine. Needless is to say that I returned it. The quality and service is not there. At Buffalo Tools they appear to be helpful and knowledgeable, but the product is inferior. I would think that a basic inspection would have caught these problems. I bought a different one from a reliable brand and no problems."
1,READ THIS ONE,"LIKE MOST PEOPLE, I GOT THIS FOR EMERGENCY.--WHEN I GOT IT,- I RAN IT FOR AN HOUR WITH A BIG AIR CONDITIONER, AND IT RAN GREAT,- ABOUT 6-8 MONTHS LATER CAME HURICANE IRENE, I RAN IT FOR ABOUT 20 HOURS. THE BOLTS INSIDE THE GENERATOR HEAD FELL OUT- (THEY WERE NOT TITE AND W/O THREAD LOCK)-- THE ENGINE CONTINUED TO RUN AND THE BOLT CAUGHT IN THE ARMATURE AND SHORTED IT, AND BROKE THE WINDINGS INSIDE.THE GENERATOR ITSELF IS SHOT ! !THE WHOLE THING IS OF NO USE NOW, AND-- I CAN NOT EVEN USE THE GAS ENGINE, BECAUSE THE CRANK SHAFT IS ONE WITH THE GENERATOR HEAD AND CAN NOT BE DISCONNECTED. I AM BUYING A DIFFERENT GENERATOR TO REPLACE THIS AS SOON AS I CAN CAVE THE MONEY OR IT.IT'S SAD BECAUSE THE GAS ENGINE RUNS AND STARTS GREAT!"
2,"looks good, runs good; but doesn't generate power",Received as a gift and didn't get around to needing it for a couple of weeks. It started right up after putting oil and gas in; but almost nothing came out. It will not generate more than a few volts - like 5vac and 0.4vdc. The manual sure doesn't address this problem. Don't know where to return or have it fixed at no charge.
1,Useless junk,"I didn't expect it to have clean enough power for a computer or TV, so I hooked it up (separately) to two enterprise-grade online UPS units - an APC SmartUPS SUA2200XL and a Liebert GXT2 - in order to clean up the power. Neither of them detected the power correctly - both would turn on and off. So I gave up on that and just decided to use it for my refrigerator/freezer which is an LG that is just a few years old. It did work with that, but boy did the refrigerator sound 'off' running on this generator. If you want power that's anywhere near clean, look elsewhere. Also, this is the loudest generator I've heard to date. Note that this seller is not who I ordered it from, but it's the same piece of crap item."
1,Sportsman Generator 6.5HP,I received the generator a few days after ordering. It started but did not produce electricity. The Buffalo tools rep refered me to a local hardware store that can repair it. I dropped it off 4 weeks ago today to be repaired and am waiting for the repair. Next time I will avoid products like Buffalo tools and use trusted brand names.
4,Exactly what I needed,"Not huge power output, but good value for the price, and big enough to run two refrigerators, lights, TVs, etc.. Starts easily, runs much quieter than the bigger HP units (noticeable after recent hurricane when everyone in the neighborhood had their generators running).Portable enough to throw in the Tahoe and power my quiet electric chainsaw in the field. Ran the light chainsaw all day without refueling or mixing gas, etc. With this generator my gas chainsaw probably won't see much use anymore."
2,Lousy Range,"Other reviews fairly reflected my feelings about the system. My complaint is the range from the base set to the handset. I live in a fairly large townhome. My baseset is at the front of the first floor and one of the handsets is at the rear of the second floor. The distance is only 80' plus 12' up. The handset can not communicate at that range. This is a normal house with regard to heating ducts, electrical wiring, etc.AT&T; cusomter service was great when I first brought this to their attention and even sent me a new base unit. I also tried different handsets, all to no avail."
3,Poor sound quality in answering machine...,I love all the features that come with this phone so I hate to give it up. But it has always had muffled sound quality in the answering machine messages that are left by incoming callers. It has gradually gotten worse. It's impossible to understand what people are saying if you try to call in and pick up your calls from another location. I am hoping that by changing the battery this may improve. I have had this phone for 3 yrs.
4,"Kiss Me Once, Kiss Me Twice",The story is interesting. A mother raising daughters with a different outlook towards men. Reality that everyone has been raised one way and reality of life can be another. Good to read.
4,terry wood is a horrible music critic,"Reading the reviews Mr. Wood has given Ray Lynch horrified me enough to at least defend what I regard as the greatest composer of my time. Phrases such as ""one hit wonder"" and general descriptions of Ray's genius as average made for tv music leads me to believe Terry, though I am sure an accomplished music critic, does not know the first thing about timeless, quality music. I suspect Mr. wood is content in his gutless, mainstream wonderland of nsync, yanni and ANYTHING not daring to be differeny and creative. Ray Lynch is a thousand times the man and talent Terry Wood will ever be."
2,"OK overview, but stops short... not real pleased","This book provides a decent overview of eBay development, but it stops short of providing many direct solutions to programming issues. It's more of a reference (which it does an ok job of being), full of tables of values, etc. However, that's all available in eBay's documentation.I was not at all happy with the author's use of C# psudo-code rather than showing actual code. Did he have some super-secret app that he didn't want to share? I downloaded the code from the web site, but there were many examples that did not work.Your choices with this book are C# and Pearl. There's not a line of VB.NET. Also, the web site only give you the sample code... nothing up there about new changes (such as Auth & Auth) that eBay has recently added.Overall, I'm not really happy with this book. It feels like it was released to get something out there first, not best."
2,disappointed!!!,"Vitamin Water is blowing it. It was a great low sugar ,or less sugar alternative, that didn't have artificial sweeteners or the taste of them. Now, why add stevia??? It may be natural, but it tastes just like the worst artificial sweeteners. I'm really going to stop drinking them, because its in the regular options too, and not just Zero. It was so unnecessary. Zero is available if you need that extra artificial taste."
1,hives!,"Whenever I drink this product I break out in hives. What's up with that? This is the third time now, guess I won't drink anymore Glaceau Vitamin Water."
5,"What you never knew about whales and salmon, and fun to read!","I'm not sure what I expected when I bought this book, but I was amazed and delighted after I started to read it. Living in the Inland Northwest, I have always had an interest in whales and dolphin, but never knew much. Alexandra Morton has devoted her life to studying then. She writes in a very readable way and conveys interesting, fun as well as disturbing information. Definitely well worth a read."
4,Excellent Book,"This is a great book. Alexandra does a fantastic job of tying her life into the Orca's and educating us about their plight. I would recommend this book to anyone who was interested in learing more orcas, and to hear an interesting story along the way."
1,A Big Disappointment,The cartoons included in this DVD are the last and worst of the Mr. Magoo series. Even small children seem to have no interest in them.
4,Listen to this great President,"This is a good set of abridged speeches. The edits are well done by fading in and out. The speech titles are extremely hard to read on the CD. Great for the ride to work, etc."
4,Great Bare Floor Vacuum,"I bought this vacuum to do my wood and tile floors, which it does a great job on. I didn't realize you have to buy the bare floor attachment separately though, but, after I got it, I loved it. It is lightweight, small and easy to maneuver and carry, and the attachments fit nicely in a top compartment so they can't fall out-a great plus. It is quiet, and has a variable suction lever if you want to do gentle vacuuming, such as curtains. It is easy to store because it sits up and the hose hooks onto the side of the machine. My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that it doesn't do a super job on carpets. It's OK, but I bought it for bare floors anyway. I use an upright for carpeting, which I think always do better on carpets anyway. Bosch makes such good solid products that last and I'm sure this one will too - it seems very well built and I'm extremely happy with the purchase. I call it my Orange Egg."
4,SFA-AOK,"Outspaced is a fantastic collection of SFA rarities and B sides. A must for the collector. Contained within is a hard to find track, The Man Don't Give a F***. Also included form their Ice Hocky Hair EP is the track Smokin. All of outspaced tracks were recorded during the periods of their first two albums. This album is a must for SFA fans-but not the album to get if you want to try the super furries on for size."
5,Great Book,"I purchased a copy of this book and it is simply amazing. Well written and concise, it lays out Unity Metaphysics to a tee. I have read it and found utter enjoyment in its straight to the point explanations/definitions. I can hardly wait for the next book in the series to come out."
3,Not exactly as advertised,"The price was good, shipping quick, but a couple of minor issues... There was no cables, which would have made hooking it up a breeze, rather than having to make my own. Minor inconvenience, I had hope to avoid. Also claimed to come with 150 amp fuses, but got 200 amp instead. Fortunately, I already ordered the 150 amp fuses, and have plenty of cable. Still a good deal, but just a little let down one these two points, that would have made it a great deal. Didn't return or complain, or since it would have been sort of pointless, already had everything on hand, although a couple of spare fuses wouldn't hurt."
5,super speakers!,"These monsoon speakers completed my awesome Buick Regal GSE...Super shippping time, product as described, most excellent all the way!! Thank you very much!"
1,Stay away from this one!,"Owned for about 15 months, 4 of which were spent in repair. Never dropped this watch, always took care of it. Wore it for 3 months when communting on my bike to work and class and needed a dependable timepiece to manage my active schedule. This watch mysteriously stopped and started again unpredictably and unnoticably several times per day. I was constantly resetting the watch and running late to boot. I sent it back for a repair and the movement was replaced for free, but I had to buy a Timex in the interim and waited 4 months until it was returned. Wore the watch for 8 more months during which the lumibrite material denoting the markers and numbers started to flake off and bounce around atop the watch face. At the 15th month, the start/stop problem with the movement returned...unexpectedly of course. I decided it wasn't worth the trouble as the 1-yr warranty had expired. Wish I had my money back."
5,"Rugged, Easy to Read","The Swiss Army Renegade watch is the most rugged watch I've ever owned. Its numbers are large and easiy read at a glance. The design is simple and doesn't have unnecessary ornamental detailing. The watch case is made from a lightweigh yet durable plastic (it may sound cheap but it's quality material). And the flexible band is very comfortable yet strong.While I was a handyman for a number of years, I subjected this watch to mutiple cleaners, solvents, paints, and it always kept on ticking. Not even swimming in the Pacific Ocean during a Hawaiian vacation could stop it.You can easily replace the battery yourself with a knife. I've replaced the band once but only after abusing it for years.I recommend the Swiss Army Renegade watch to anyone who requires a work watch but wants an understated look."
3,The goods and the bads,"I bought this watch to replace an identical model I wore for 20 years before it finally failed. I expect the same service from this one. It cost about three times what I paid for the old one, which, I guess is expected.The watch and band weigh 1.5 oz. The package arrived weighing 32 oz. Most of this weight was a very elaborate three piece display box. Since I wear, not display, the watch, the box is in the landfill.The watch band is disappointingly crudely made. The buckle on the band is full of sharp edges and rough mold marks that scratched and irritated my wrist. I filed and trimmed to no avail, finally solving the roughness by flaming the buckle with a cigarette lighter. This melted and rounded off the rough, sharp edges.I suggest Victorinox spend less on the box and more on the buckle."
5,Best of its Kind - Informative and Fun to Read,"I loved this book. Much more than a how-to book, so well written that I would have read it just for pleasure, even if I hadn't needed the detailed and clear practical instruction. Very historically informative. Reminds me of some of the best cookbooks: the reading of it is as much fun as making the recipes."
1,upside down,"This foolish book attempts to make the case that Bentley initiated the age of McCarthy. According to that thinking, anyone who unmasked a traitor was a McCarthyite- that is beyond stupid. What Igor Gouzenko and Bentley and Whittaker Chambers did was to expose the extent of Soviet espionage in the US. With the publication of Venona and the previously secret KGB files we know now that there were more Americans who betrayed their country than we ever suspected. They were traitors to the US and seriously damged this country. They were the real villains of the age."
4,"Good, first bio on Liz Bently","Although the life of Elizabeth Bently deserves a bigger book, I enjoyed this first biography of the enigmatic but fascinating commie spy, Elizabeth Bently. The author attempts to explain this Vassar educated American woman who became a Russian spy, but Bently still remains a vague phantom. Since I'm fascinated by that whole period--of Joe McCarthy, Alger Hiss, the shocking presence of real-life commnists in American government back in the 30s and 40s--I found this book very readable. You might also enjoy related books, especially Ann Coulter's best-selling, ""Treason,"" which really delivers the goods about how the Communist scare of the 40s and 50s was not the imaginary fear of paranoid Americans. It really was something to cause genuine fear. Elizabeth Bently revealed just have intensive this spy network was."
5,A mini education on pearls and Japan!,"I am working my way through the first 56 Nancy Drew mysteries. I am buying them and reading them in no particular order. So far, this is one of my favorites. I learned so much about pearls and how they are made and I love the cultural information that was in the book about Japan and many of the customs. The cover art is beautiful I enjoyed the illustrations throughout the book as well. Ned is back and once again thrown in the path of danger helping Nancy solve a mystery that involves pearls, a trip to Japan, thieves, an underworld collection of cultists and a trip to the beauty parlor."
5,"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful book!",This final book in the Nancy Drew series really finishes it of well. The haunting case of the missing pearl draws the readers into the book faster than you could imagine. A truely wonderful book!
3,It should have been longer...,"When a pearl is stolen from a local jeweler named Mr.Moto, Nacy Drew is asked to locate the item and bring it back. Her case leads her to Japan where she stays with relatives of Mr.Moto.Nancy goes through perilous situations just to find the pearl. She disguises herself as a Tokyo girla and starts picking up clues. Will Nancy be able to solve the mystery or is it too complex?The book was okay in it's own sense. But I think there should have been more to the story. Such as near the end where they find the thieves. The whole thing going on there should have been expalined more. It left me out in the dark a little. For some reason I just felt somthing was missing. Although the setting in Japan was quite interesting.I reccomend this book to Nancy Drew fans because it is the last one of the original(this is not the original book though) series."
4,Great Starter bow,"I'm a little bummed that this bow isn't stronger, but it works great for what it was designed to do, throw an arrow pretty accurately at a target.i attached a lot of stuff to it, would recommend not doing that at first, get used to the bow first..."
4,Meladrama,"This is a very different story plot. Because of the era of the film it is very played, meladramatic. But that was the style. It is still a good story."
5,ALPHA DVD VERSION!!!,"Director Ty Garnett (THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE) makes the most of an almost no-budget situation and manages to turn out an amazingly well made neat little thriller... Yes, it has all the noir plot devices going for it, yet this film is LIGHT, filmed in broad daylight with sharp, crisp images! Loretta Young has probably never been better, and Barry Sullivan is as good as always! He has her post a letter accusing her of murdering him. He then dies trying to kill her...and now she must get back that damning letter!All I need to add is to insure you that the Alpha dvd is indeed TOP-NOTCH!!! Crisp, clear...as tho-it-had-been-shot yesterday quality!So, if you want to add this movie to your noir/mystery/murder catagory, do not hesitate to purchase this beautiful dvd!Super nice print, super affordible, SUPER RECOMMENDED!!!"
1,"A great Idea, but ...","I really looked forward to getting this product. I have 75% ofthe Dragon Magazine on my shelves, but trying to search for somethingis a lot easier with all of them online. The one problem that I have with the product is that it doesn't seem to work reliably on Windows NT and there haven't been any patches posted for several months. END"
5,This is pretty cool stuff,"I should of bought more because it actually does work. I think you'd have to use about 3/4 of a container of this on a full water bottle, so make sure your victims drink up first! It makes water look almost like a gooey slush. I put some in some milk, boy is it ever nasty. When buying this product I'd reccomend buying atleast about 6 containers. It's fun to experiment with, plus you gotta have a bunch left over to prank your friends!"
2,Makes a choppy one use solution,When I poured a fourth of this bottle into about a half cup of water and swooshed it a bit I poured it out and it was like water but had like slime in it. I don't think this product is very safe. If you use this I suggest prancing someone with a small amount of liquid so it clots up stiffer.
5,the best captain america ever...!!!!!!!,finally I purchased my marvel legends face off captain america vs. red skull...!!! and all I can say is this guy is the best captain america ever release... if you get this set you don't need an other captain america figure really...!!! I Highly recomment this two pack figures and believe me you won't be dissapointed...!!! this is the real deal to get worth for the money!!!!
3,Not a good match,"I love Enio Morriconi's music. I really like Yo-Yo Ma's playing. Unfortunately, I did not really like the combination. I much prefer the original orchestration of Morriconi's scores."
2,Not quite,"Ennio Morricone has time after time proven himself as one of the greatest composers of all time, inside or outside the realm of film. And Yo-Yo Ma is undoubtedly an accomplished cellist. But their styles just don't blend.Yo-Yo Ma puts something of a 'classical sheen' on the music, and effectively it brings out the worst in Morricone. Of course his compositions and arrangements have always been meticulous, but they also had a quirky, ramshackle quality that is lacking on this recording.I'd say try John Zorn's 'The Big Gundown' for a more interesting and adventurous take on Morricone, or Triology 'Plays Ennio Morricone' for a string trio interpretation, similar in theory to Yo-Yo Ma's but with so much more life.Or better still, go for the Morricone originals - 'A Fistful Of Film Music' is a great start."
2,Audio Distortion Yo-Yo Ma Plays Ennio Morricone,The first CD I ordered exhibited some audio distortion. I returned it and received a new CD which has the same problem.I have played the CD on different players and experience the same audio distortion.I would give this product 5 stars ifthe audio problem did not exist.
1,Too bad. It could've been great,"Love Yo Yo Ma. Love Morricone. But this album is so awash in Mantovani/Muzak/1001 Strings reverb you can hardly enjoy either Ma or Morricone. Remarkably, Morricone was the producer, so presumably his decision. What a huge miscalculation to swamp the music this way. Cheesy."
1,Interesting CD,"Beware,the media after a while willl disapper from your cd. The cd has a 1-800 number to call. It is disconnected.I guess Sony produces so many duds it dosen't want to provide service anymore. This Sony CD is high priced junk. After a year all the music has gone poof into nowhere. Just cheap junk."
1,Get REAL!!!,"This is the WORST Yo Yo Ma album I have EVER heard....good god....look, if you want to really hear Morricone at his best, buy the soundtrack to the movie ""The Mission"". If you do not own that soundtrack, then you have no business pretending you are getting Grade A Morricone by purchashing this totally rancid CD. This celebrity collaboration fails at every level and is the most boring, wandering CD I have ever heard with only the first cut being only briefly half way OK. This is so beneath the talent of both these accomplished artists that it is a wonder how it EVER got produced.....all these glowing 5 start tributes mean ZIP.....don't buy it. Stay very far away from this album if you have any wits about you. Just because somebody put two big names together and slapped out an album doesn't mean it is by definition going to be good. This is a total failure."
5,Fantastic!,"This CD by Yo-Yo-Ma is fantastic. Lots of energy in the music. The movie themes are great, love it!"
2,Great CD ruined (the MP3's at least),"This is an awesome album but un-enjoyable because many of the songs seem to cut off at the end, sometimes in the middle of a note or before the last note fully dies out.This could just be the MP3 download version so be aware."
4,Incredibly Beautiful but Transition Problems Between Tracks,"I can't believe how much I like this rendition of The Ecstasy of Gold. And Dinner, Malena, Marco Polo, Nocturne,... Oh what the heck, the entire album is beautiful. Yo-Yo Ma and Ennio Morricone certainly rate higher than 5. However, there are clumsy transitions between some tracks. That's why I rated the CD a 4."
5,Gorgeous Music CD,"I am a fan of the music of composer, Ennio Morricone.Add in the talent of Yo Yo Ma with gorgeous arrangements and I find myself listening to this CD over and over again.I do not tire of it at all."
4,Yo Yo Ma and the Maestro Marvelous!!!,"Having recently succumbed to Yo Yo Ma after a longtime love of Ennio Marricone I was excited to get this CD from Amazon. It is superb! All of the songs had to be recrafted by Morricone to suit Yo Yo Ma but it is a great listen as you sonically travel down memory lane through some of Maestro Moricone's musical marvels. ""Gabriel's Oboe"" from ""The Mission"" now becomes ""Gabriel's Cello."" I laugh as Yo Yo Ma bows his brains out on the ""Ecstacy of Gold' from ""The Good,The Bad, and The Ugly."" I recommend this to all Yo Yo Ma and Morricone fans...a great listen. Soothing after a hard day!"
4,Y0Y0 meets Ennio,"Having first heard this at a friend's home I was entranced by the pure, soulful lure of the cello. The songs rendered here are stirring, familiar and beautiful. Who can resist ""Cinema Paradiso"" and ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"" and the wonderful ""Gabriel's Oboe""? Yo Yo Ma is at his best and when paired with the amazing talent of Enzio Morricone you truly have a beautiful CD, worth playing again & again. You will love it!"
4,Yo-yo Ma enhances Morricone's music,"Morricone's music is the perfect companion to cello strings beautifully played by Yo-yo Ma. Personally, I missed some of the Spaghetti Western melodies (such as 'A fistful of dollars', 'A fistful of dynamite'), but there're others that won't deceive to Morricone's fans.Definitively, a good buy. Recommended"
5,Gift,"The person receiving was very pleased. We have listen several times hearing many different aspects, tone, sound, and interpretation. This is the first purchase of Ennio Marricone, I was very pleased with the gift."
4,Great music by a great cellist!,"I heard this music first on Pandora, so bought the CD right away. The music is haunting and enjoyable, and it proves once again that Yo-Yo Ma is one of the most versatile artists around."
4,Music cut short?,"I purchased the entire album in MP3 and play it on the Amazon Cloud, I love the music and the quality of the music, but some of the songs got cut short as they are continuous to the next song, and therefore, if you don't play them in sequence, it will appear the music is cut."
4,Yo-Yo Ma Plays Ennio Morricone,I think anyone who is a fan of Ennio Morricone's music would have to enjoy this recording especially played by Yo-Yo Ma surely one of the best cello players around.
2,Two many defects in MP3 format,"I downloaded the whole Album in MP3 and found that the first two pieces are mixed and truncated improperly. As a matter of fact, the last 50 seconds of the first piece Gabriel's Oboe is actually the begining of the second piece The Falls. So The Fall has an abrupt start. In addition to these two pieces, #4, #9 and #15 also have sudden cut-offs in their endings. #18 and #19 are similar to #1 and #2. It seems to me they are divided into two pieces from a continues play. This is supposed to be a great album. But with so many defects in MP3, I don't think it is worth $9.99 to download. One thing I need to mention is Amazon customer service. Once I called them and described the problems, they immediately agreed to issue a full refund and claim that they will fixed the defects. By looking at the reviews, this issue has been there for a while. I hope it will be fixed soon."
5,Great Gift!,"Instead of wine or flowers take this wonderful CD. I buy several to keep on hand for gifts. Everyone I've given this to loves it. When I have the recording on in my home, guests always comment on it."
5,Gorgeous Music,The team of Yo-Yo Ma and Ennio Morricone is something to behold. Wonderful Melodies. I've listened to this again and again.
5,Yo-Yo Ma Surprises Us Again,"Before I bought this terrific album as an unusual gift for a musician friend, I had never heard of Ennio Morricone, who composes both well-known movie themes and also background music for films. You'll recognize many of these pieces as soon as you hear them. Yo-Yo Ma plays beautifully, of course, as he always does, and he treats these pieces with the seriousness of purpose that they deserve. If you're looking for a real musical treat that's a little bit off the beaten path, then congratulations, you've found it!"
1,"DO NOT TRUST THESE with ""good"" clothes!","Having never tried these before, we decided to do a test with old clothes before trusting with ""good"" clothes. I put a couple of pairs of jeans and some knit shirts - a couple of which were red - and an old white t-shirt in the washer, and ran it. After it finished, not only did the color catcher sheet have red dye on it, but the white t-shirt had red dye on it as well.I will continue to use the sheets with my ""mixed light"" daily wear laundry, as well as with dark loads that contains anything red, because the sheets probably will help some, but I will not trust them with anything that I really do not want to have stained - will continue to use common sense and wash whites only with other whites, etc. And I do suggest that you test these yourself before you put your ""good"" clothes at risk, also."
5,They actually work,"I'm always pleasantly surprised when something works as advertised. These color catchers do. I no longer use different loads for white and deep-colored shirts. You should not skimp on them, though. For new, deep-coloreds, and large, mixed loads, etc, you will need 2 or 3 or even more sheets. The price is reasonable, with Amazon's Super Saver Shipping and Subscribe & Save."
2,Artificial Intelligences Exist Today,"Scientists have formulated at least 100 definitions of intelligence. (for a partial listing see www.vetta.org/definitions-of-intelligence/)Several computer programs exist which qualify as intelligent according to at least the vast majority of these definitions. (for instance my Asa,Trans. of the Kansas Acad, of Sci., vol. 109, # 3/4, pg 159, 2006,www.bioone.org/archive/0022-8443/109/3/pdf/i0022-8443-109-3-159.pdf)Not all creatures are equally intelligent so there is no need for an AI to be as intelligent as the average human. In point of fact, however, AIs exist which outperform humans at a number of important tasks."
1,"To see the stage version, skip this piece of trash!","The first bad decision was to cast a non-singer in the role that has one of the best ballads ever written for a baritone in a musical, ""My Time of Day""! Brando is a joke! Simmons can't sing either! What were they thinking? The only great casting was Vivian Blaine, a true musical theatre performer, tried and true from the fierce competition of Broadway. At least one has the chance to see her work. Sinatra is passable but largely wasted as the real singing talent as needed in the Brando role??? A TOTAL JOKE that trashes the original!"
4,"Guys & Dolls, but not their music","Excellent copy of the musical, but be sure to realize the music is ""from the era,"" not from the movie."
4,Enjoyable,"This film was not as great as expected, particularly bacause of some corny lines in the script and the song ""A Bushel and a Peck.""...Overall, it is deservedly a classic."
4,Passably entertaining,"The Bottom Line:Guys and Dolls is not a great movie musical and it feels a little long at 150 minutes, but Brando and Sinatra are fun to watch and if you can get past the intentionally-exaggerated New Yawk accents you'll probably enjoy the film; don't expect a classic but rent it if you like the actors or the genre.3/4"
1,Very poor!!!,"I was looking forward to a Special Edition of this wonderful film, but this new release is all a disappointment to me. I have just bought the German release of it. The picture is not as clear and sharp, as it could or should be, but mainly, the image is extremely cropped! Parts of the heads and legs (and that with a dancing movie!!!) are cut off all the time. It's a shame!!! :-(Only 1 star for the DVD, the film would deserve at least 3."
1,It's not anamorphic....,so don't buy it if you have a wide-screen TV - unless you like watching a little picture in the middle of a big screen.
4,Downplayed the comedy in favor of the romance,"I saw Guys & Dolls on stage and thought it was a riot, so I bought this classic on DVD. You can certainly tell the difference between directors. The stage really pushed the comedic side while the old film pushed the romance. The 2 male roles almost scream for over-the-top acting while Brando & Ol' Blue Eyes kept their roles close to the vest. Still, this was a great production & I got a kick out of Brando singing & dancing."
5,Marlon Brando.....who'da thought?,"I had never seen Guys and Dolls before. I didnt know what it was about, but my father had seen it on the stage and thought it was great. I bought this movie blind. I have always liked musicals, so I thought 'why not?' I noticed that Marlon Brando was in it and thought that was interesting. I had never really seen anything with him in it before. I went home and watched it, and I was completely impressed. He is completely believable in this role. I think everyone is. Frank Sinatra is amazing. He has a voice like no one else. I have to say this was a great purchase. I have watched it twice in the three days that I have had it so far. I would recommend it to anyone who likes musicals or likes any of the actors.And on a side note...Is there anyone that can say that Marlon Brando was not one of the most attractive men ever? After this movie, I am hooked! I have to go and see every movie he made in the fifties now."
5,THEY DON'T MAKE THEM LIKE THAT ANYMORE!!!,"THE SINGING IS UNTOUCHABLE! IT WAS ""GONE WITH THE WIND"" CASTING (COULDN'T IMAGINE ANYONE ELSE GIVING A BETTER PERFORMANCE). THE ACTING SUBLIME, SARAH BROWN'S INSECURITY SPILLS OUT OF THE TV, AND THE LOOKS SKY MASTERSON GIVES HER IN MOST SCENES COULD MELT AN ICEBERG. IN ALL WAYS IT IS TOP NOTCH QUALITY, THEY JUST DON'T MAKE THEM LIKE THAT ANYMORE!!!"
4,Fairly Deluxe Edition of a Musical Classic,"""Guys and Dolls"" is a fairly faithful, good adaptation of the great Broadway stage musical. Unlike ""West Side Story"" or ""My Fair Lady"", it isn't a film that cries out ""SPECIAL EDITION!"" but it is fine to have one available.MGM has given the film a fine special edition (or Deluxe Edition as they call it) treatment. The box is nice and reflects some of the original artwork with modern touches. The scrapbook (A collection of old advertising and photos) is fine as well.As for the disc itself, the two documentaries are fine. No rare photographs from the Broadway or film archives are shown, but the interviews from the children of the creators (Loesser, Goldwyn and Mankiewicz) and the choreographer, Michael Kidd are quite nice and informative.The film itself recieves a nice treatment although it is quite similar to the previous editions."
2,Terrible transfer--no better than the previous release,"Having owned the previous non anamorphic DVD version, I was expecting this DVD to be much improved.Guess what? There is practically NO difference in picture quality, despite the fact that this version is anamorphic.The box says ""Remastered in High Definition""...what a joke.Stay away until the powers that be do this film correctly."
3,Guys & Dolls. Blu-Ray,"I love this movie, but was disappointed by the treatment Warner Bros. have given it...The colour is over saturated and the contrast too high. The previous DVD was more natural.I also experienced the same problem with Gigi.The sound is strictly stereo. The 1080p picture could be clearer. Come on Warner Bros.,you can do a lot better than this."
3,Fun movie - could be better,"Yes Marlon Brando can sing - or at least carry a tune. This is the fun story of a bad bet gone good. Some of the songs are forgettable, but most musicals have some forgettable songs. The memorable songs like ""Can do"", ""Sit down you're rockin' the boat"", ""Luck be a lady"", ""The guy's only doin' it for some doll"" and ""Adelaide"" make up for it, for the most part. I would like to have heard more singing from Sinatra too.For me the worst parts of the movie were the two night club floor show numbers. I don't feel these scenes are appropriate for children because the women performing the numbers are practically naked. My son covered his eyes and my daughter just rolled hers and left the room till the numbers were over. The songs are really stupid too. Did people really like to go to clubs like that and see shows like that? It's hard for me to believe anyone would, but it was a different time and day. From now on we will use the fast-forward button on these loser numbers."
1,Artsy Fartsy,"""Fool For Love"" is based on a Sam Shepard`s play, and the movie`s leads are Shepard himself and Kim Basinger as a married couple who face an identity crisis and must overcome their differences in order to be unite again or disjointed forever. While the idea is promising and the first minutes intriguing, it soon turns into a pretensious, lifeless, slow and unfinishable picture. What could have been an interesting piece about love, guilt, dysfunction and desire becomes a sucession of empty dialogs, wooden monologues and tepid flashbacks that fail to engage. Director Robert Altman sure wasted a good opportunity with this snoozer. Avoid."
4,Great Classic Movie,"I bought this just to prepare for a local Summerstock Theater production, but found that it was a great classic movie with an outstanding cast of characters. The only drawback is that it is a very long movie and tends to drag in a few spots. However, the overall movie is well worth sitting through the few slow spots."
4,Guys and Dolls,"Fun to see Brando slim, singing and dancing. Sinatra entertaining as always. Vivian Blaine hysterical as Sinatra's doll. Stubby Kaye excellent."
1,Huge classics fan but this was a total bore.,"I love movies like The Philadelphia Story, or His Girl Friday, or Stage door I even love Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, they all have fantastic dialog! As far as musicals I found Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, Meet me in St Louis and even White Christmas ++ completely charming. I own most of these and re-watch them.With that being said I just saw this movie Guys and Dolls at an outdoor venue and the dialogue was dreadful, the dance scenes were so cheesy, the story line was so unbelievably boring and the characters mostly unlikable. I found myself praying that this would be over soon so I could get my ride home so I could go to sleep. No coolness factor, not sweet lovable charm, slow on the scenes and unlikable characters.. This movie just grated on my nerves. What more can I say but don't buy this. I know I'm going to be a lone reviewer but, I had to say my truth."
1,How to RUIN a great musical,"One of Broadway's ""best ever"" musicals was absolutely ruined by Hollywood's casting of Marlon Brando and Jean Simmons. Sinatra is OK but doesn't really have the acting/comedic chops to pull this off.What the hell were they thinking? If you've ever seen even an amateur stage production of this incredibly wonderful musical, you'll HATE this movie. Even ""Adelaide's Lament"" is poorly filmed/directed even though the actress is the original B'way Adelaide. Sad... very sad. I haven't purchased this movie from Amazon; I've cringed thru several showings of this bomb on TV and in movie theatres. This is not a comment on the reproduction qualities of the film, it's a comment on the original crappy casting and direction of what should could have been a timeless and cherished musical classic gem (imagine 'West Side Story' if starring Donny Osmond as Tony, Miley Cyrus as Maria and directed by whoever directed 'Caddy Shack'). Oh... the horror!"
5,As excellent as the VHS version (almost),"While the picture was better than on the VHS version, as is normal of DVD movies, the movie seemed slower than the VHS. The opening musical sequence where the camera follows people around the city, for example, seemed to take longer than on the DVD and the scene in Cuba was not as upbeat. Other than that, though, it was the same in every respect. Brando and Simmons had a palpable chemistry that some people can only wish to experience. Sinatra and Blaine lit up the screen with their musical and comical portrayals of Nathan and Adelaide. A definate classic that musical lovers should see. As a musical lover myself, it is my favorite!"
5,A Guy Would do Anything For A Doll,this is truley a masterpiece of work. this is one of the best musicals i've ever seen this is a good movie. the cast in this movie is phenomenal. this is a great movie. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend that you do
4,Wonderful,"The musical was wonderful with Brando and Sinatra. Had never seen it before, but my Granddaughter is going to be in the musical in Chicago and I wanted to see what it was about. I would recommend it to everyone and especially if you like musicals or the lead actors."
1,Author misquotes,"The teachings in this book are the most extreme among the young Earth Christian creationists. I don't even need to comment on the veracity of those viewpoints.Since this is a book review, I'll stick to reviewing its literary value, which is less than zero.I went to the library and checked the references cited in the book. In about an hour I found a ton of gross misquotes and misrepresentations.They even had the audacity to misquote Carl Sagan: ""According to Carl Sagan, fossils could prove there is a Creator."" [Ch5 p.70] In the referenced work, Carl Sagan said the opposite. (In his later book, ""Broca's Brain"", he called the author ""shamelessly dishonest"".)"
3,Heady Reading,I really like ken wilber but this is a really heady read. I needed it for class and it took awhile for me to read it.
4,memories of montreal...,"I first heard MC Solaar during my summer rowing in Montreal. I wouldn't say I'm a hip-hop fan but MC Solaar was our crew's favorite CD during erg workouts and training. My French has faltered (understatement), but I had to dance when I heard this CD. ""Zoom"" is perfect for my funky workouts. Slower tracks work with single-malt and kicking-back."
3,"He's got skills, but this CD don't.","What's with the live drums and guitars? Not very hip. I guess if you're going to see the show, it might be a lot more interesting, but I'm a little more into the samples. Stick to the studio records."
1,Not the Thomas Standard,My boys are crazy for all things Thomas and we bought this for them for Christmas. The material is cheap and hard. Not soft enough for children or anyone for that matter. Very disappointing.
2,I expected more from this CD,"Remix albums always are like tossing a coin, you never know what will be the result, sometimes it is good, some other times it stinks. This album is in the middle low part. I purchased this CD because it was a reduced CD ($4.99), and on top of that, because of the LUAKA BOP name on it: David Byrne is a genius and i know most of his label groups such as ""Los Amigos Invisibles"", ""Si-sé"", ""Los de Abajo"" and many more, furthermore, I recognize that David Bimself (thru Luaka Bop) got a talent that lead him to discover and sign emerging bands, unfortunately, not all things that come from Luaka Bop are that good.Half of the tracks on this CD doesn't worth the pay, but I can rescue a couple, the chillin ""Bruja"" from los Amigos invisbles, folky bossa sound of ""afro blue"" (susana baca) and the upbeat ""The Rain"" (from the Latin band Si-sé).A CD for Collectors only, despite that, I will keep it just becuase of the tunes I mentioned above."
4,"Great label, great artists, great remiixes","A label by Mr David Byrne that keeps exploring world music. Now making it accesible to a broader audience through these impecable remixes from great producers.Great quality, great experience. Keep the series coming!!!!"
4,Very Early and Terrific Goulet,"I was fortunate to have both Always You and In Person on vinyl, and the CD reproduction of the albums is terrific. Robert Goulet's ""Always You"" was his first, and recorded within 6 months of his Camelot debut. It has a very serious feel, and there is no doubt that he sounds terrific. The man can sing. Now the live ""In Person"" album shows his vocal talents off very well and I believe that this was actually recorded in 8/62 not 8/61 as the liner notes on the CD indicate. I don't think this live version is quite as good as the ""On Tour"" album released in 1966. But it captures a young performer not yet totally at ease in the patter between songs, but nailing every song he sings. If you are a fan, it is a must buy. Enjoy"
2,Auto Ventshade 94734,I questioned the company when I bought it I told them I didnt like the Idea the way they fastened to the vehicle its suppose to adhease to the rubber part around the window I didnt think it would work but they assured me it would. Well it lasted 1 week and they were falling off and I also done what the mfg. told me to do during installation cleaning extra good with alchol it failed so I then removed them again I cleaned it with alchol then I put a bead of silicone inplace of the 2 sided sticky tape and its been just fine for the past 3 months even through car wash blowers. Your wasting your time to do what the recommended proceedure is they wont stay fastened unless you silicone them on!
5,BRUTAL RIPPING HARDCORE,"Absolutely the best recording to grace my computer....EVER. CATHETER stands out with ""SLAIN AND BROKEN"" as the premier track on this comp. Hopefully a full-length is coming soon...until then, this tidbit of absolute ripping madness with great artistic talent will have to do. This comp, in general, is definately worth a listen and purchase. With 40 tracks....I call it the best buy of the year."
3,Notch below some other Hard Case books,"I haven't read all the Hard Case books but this is definitely a notch below ""Lucky at Cards"" and ""Blackmailer"".The plot moves along but the writing is flat. And even for pulp fiction, the plot is full of gaping holes and cardboard characters.If you love everything about Hard Case, but the book. If you are not a complete fan of the genre (like myself), skip it."
4,A journey to hell,"From the outset you know that Jack Ruxton is on a journey to hell. He latches on to the teenager Shirley Angela who is caring for her rich dying stepfather. Her life seems hell - it's as if she's just waiting for the rather unpleasant old boy to die. True, but Jack and Shirley decide to speed things up. He has a bit of expertise; it won't be easy, but there's a lot of money in Shirley's inheritance...As with many noir stories, none of the characters are particularly likeable, but the writing is so mesmerising that you're quickly sucked in. Believable and tense with lashings of not too explicit sex, this is definitely worthy of being reprinted. But the title probably gives away at least one twist. Atmospheric cover which shows that the artist Gregory Manchess has read the book."
3,Good airport reading,"This is a story about a tv repairman that falls in lust with an 18 year old vixen, or perhaps, her money. They plot to hasten the death of her ailing stepfather, but numerous unforeseen problems arise. Written in the late 1950's, much of the language represents the slang and jargon of those times, and it feels like watching an episode of Dragnet. The female characters are written very Hemingway-esque, which is sort of emotional and indecisive, which I think would be called borderline personality disorder these days. This isn't a book to take too seriously, so don't expect it to be fine literature. It's easy to put down and pick back up."
3,Ok but....,"I just finished reading this book and frankly, it was a little boring. Jack meets Shirley when she calls for a repair man to install a TV and intercom system. Shirley hates the fact she has to take care of an old man.Jack gets involved with Shirley. Jack falls for Shirley.They plan to get money the quick way and it goes on from there. It`s rather predictable and the ending was awful. The story and particularly the ending, could have gone so many other ways that would have made it exciting. Anyway, I`m not a writer but if you really want to read a good pulp, I would recommend reading Fright by Cornell Woolrich-much more interesting!"
1,hate it hate it hate it hate it,"Here it is: my absolute least favorite song in all of history. Let it burn in flames. So annoying, so bad, so everything."
5,"Ah, memories...","I wore this record out when I was a kid. I guess I should have taken better care of it. Yeah, it's kinda cheesy, but it's a classic!"
5,Mickey Mouse Disco -rocks!!!,"I grew up on Mickey Mouse Disco. I must have gone through two records, but I have it on tape. My favorite song has to be ""It's A Small World"". I love that song!!!"
1,Poor Remington quality,"I purchased this shaver to replace an existing Remington shaver that I had for a couple of years. I couldn't find any replacement blades for my shaver so I decided to buy another Remington, assuming the quality would be as good as the one I had. Wrong, this shaver is so crummy I had to do a double take to make sure it was actually a Remington. It needs a charge every other day and even fully charged it runs like the battery is completed discharged. Into the trash it goes. No more ""anything"" for me with this company's brand on it."
2,"Cute, but flimsy","We bought the Willy Wonka costume for my grandson's birthday party. It was cute, but very lightweight and flimsy. Wouldn't make the same mistake again."
5,A primer on Worldview Conflicts,"Jayne Docherty's book is the best primer and case study of a worldview case study on the market. She gives a solid conceptual framework for thinking about worldviews and the process of worldviewing. She talks about the three ""worlds"" of conflict - and then shows how the negotiations between the FBI and Koresh and his followers were plagued by a lack of common worldview frames for understanding each other."
3,Not as good as the later Going Home DVD concert soundtrack,This CD did not sound as good as the Blasters Going Home live DVD soundtrack.The lead guitar sounded very different to me.
4,Quit teasing us,"So they got together in L.A. last year to put together a terrific show, which sounds great when played on CD as a live recording. I love this album. What sets it apart from many live albums is that the songs still sound fresh. Maybe it's because they ""broke up"" and hadn't played in awhile, and needed to prove something. Maybe because they knew it was going to a gig just to record a live album and they wanted to get it right. But boy, I miss them even more after seeing this.So then why four stars instead of five? Stubborn principle. First, they're redone songs. Second, I didn't see the band tour in my area, so I imagine it was a one time get together. The album itself has all the energy and musicianship I would expect from the band, and I've played it over and over again. It's just not knowing if they're going to get back into the studio or tour again that bugs me."
5,AWESOME,"SO good. I am so happy they put this on DVD. The extras make it perfect. Jason Segal is naturally funny. They have extras showing the casting videos of the stars. Its the same episodes I watched as a kid, but its an awesome show to watch when you have nothing to do on a sunday morning. The extras are real neat, seeing where the stars were then and comparing them to where they are now. I recommend this if you a fan. I paid $29.99 with Prime so wait for that price mark on Amazon."
5,Exactly what I expected...,"After reading countless reviews about the complete series DVD set of Freaks and Geeks, I couldn't pass the opportunity of purchasing. I loved the show when it was on the air and was extremely angry at NBC for taking it off. However, at least with this DVD set you can re-watch all the existing episodes. I was surprised at how many episodes I had missed. All in all, great DVD set. And like someone else had said, it'll leave you wanting more."
5,It needed to be,"This show was great. Now on DVD, it can be viewed with much more enjoyment than if it were recorded on VHS. The extras are great and makes the episodes even better."
5,The only DVD I would pay 50 bucks for,"Because so many have already done a great job of explaining why this show will never again be duplicated, I will simply say that you should buy the DVD as a reward to the producers for actually caring about the fans. Instead of simply showing the episodes, this DVD treasure contains a virtual shrine to the show. With only one season, this package truly allows a loyal fan to feel that they are getting all they can possibly get (aside from the special 8 disc set that I wish was still for sale). Simply put this show and DVD are levels above just about any other show from the last few decades."
5,Greatest Comedy Ever!!!,"It truly is a shame that this incredible show only lasted one season, but this season really does deliver, in every way possible! Fantastic acting, writing, music, and more. I am happy with the condition of the box set, and it arrived quickly after I placed the order. I highly recommend this show to all fans of shows like ""The Wonder Years"" and ""My so-called Life""."
4,How did I miss this one?,"I can't believe it took me so long to catch this. It's pretty funny to look back now knowing how almost all of these young actors turned out. Great casting choices across the board - has a little of everything - heart, comedy, drama, and good music. Kudos for getting all of the original songs on the DVD set. Now, if we can just get The Wonder Years to receive this same treatment!"
5,Honest and heartwrenching,This has been my favorite TV series since it came out. I re-bought it because my deluxe edition got scratched up and they no longer sell that version. Judd Apatow and Paul Feig have both since been involved in popular projects like 40 Year Old Virgin and Arrested Development. This show is definitely worth watching.
5,Love it,"Freaks and Geeks may be the best show ever put on TV. The DVD set is great-- they really put in every extra they could possibly think of, and then a few more. What more can I say?"
5,A great show...,This series was a delight to watch. The writing was fantastic and the whole flow and feel of the show made you wanting more. Too bad it was only one season. Go get freaky and geeky with this set.
5,One Exceptional Show,"Despite having a degree in Media Studies and am able to discuss this show on a academic level - I'd much rather just express how well written and acted this show is, never mind funny!!! I had never seen the show - but got to watch with my 12 yr.old as he recovered from having his tonsils out - anyway to quote my kid ""I am going to miss them when there is no more to watch"" - these characters and their sentiment (all of them, parents included) are as real as it gets and so are the laughs. Kuddos to the writers, directors, actors, producer and musical director! I just wish you could have ROCKED ON!!!!"
5,REAL life in high school,"Many television shows over the years,Saved by the Bell,Beverly Hills 90210,etc., tried to depict high school life. Well, they FAILED MISERABLY. The ONLY teenagers who could relate to those shows,90210,are the rich-spoiled douche-bags that are from those areas. The rest of the country's 90% adolescents can ACTUALLY relate to this abbreviated show. I personally was a ""geek"" during my first year of high-school,then became a ""freak"" of sorts. This show wasn't afraid to tackle REAL-life issues: broken homes,drug & alcohol use, teenage sex, and the need to ""fit in & find your place"". Plus this dvd collection contains all of the original music by the artists,which cost $$$. So, if you want to see what high school life is REALLY like, then buy this. You won't be sorry."
5,very good,"took a little while for it to come in the mail but over all good service, quality product two thumbs up."
5,Too bad it wasn't on longer...,Great show! The acting is amazing and it is a fabulous cast!It would have been fun to see a couple more seasons and see some of the story lines play out more.
5,Loved this show,"I faitfully watched the series in its all too brief one season and I'm putting the DVD on my wish list. In the fall of 1980 I entered 9th grade, and I can tell you that watching this series was like reliving it. The geeks reminded me so much of some of the guys in my class. The writers and actors really hit it in terms of capturing what high school was like during that era. One of my favorites was the dodgeball episode. One of the most physically painful games of our youth is now, sadly, just a memory."
5,Long live the Freaks!!!,"This show was far too good to live long, and we all knew it. And so it joined My So-Called Life in the ""actually really good and right on show about High School"" graveyard. And now, like a gift from heaven... here it is on DVD.One day network TV might actually grow some ... well, you know whats... and air some quality. I'm not holding my breath, but until then we can all groove to the collective whirrr of our DVD players."
4,RIP,"I had heard so much hype over Freaks and Geeks, although I missed it when it was actually on TV. I watched a few epiisodes from Netflix and was hooked. I just had to buy it. A heartwarming slice of life series that is also very funny. I reccomend this!"
5,Just buy it. You'll thank me.,"If I were to sum the greatness of this show in one sentence, it would be: this is something you should definitely see before you die."
3,Thought it would be better,I have heard great things about this short lived series and a few friends who I thought I trusted also really raved about it.I however was dissapointed. Not really that funny or that well done. It seems to fall a bit flat on its face. though my 12 year old son seems a bit more interested in it so we have been watching it together. Its not terrible but not at all the quality of comedy I had hoped.
1,THIS IS NOT WORTH OVER $100,"I bought this used, this edition for $30.00 and it was brand new condition.You can buy it for $60.00 at barns and noble don't be fooled this is over priced!!"
2,ITEM SENT TWICE,"I ordered this item,it was sent twice ....weeks apart.It does not show as a previous purchase although I was charged for it. Because of this,the 30 days has passed and it stil does not show.I think the service stinks!"
1,Slow moving and not interesting.,"After hearing rave reviews about this series, I managed to get my hands on the first disc. What started out as semi-interesting just turned into a very boring story with bad writing, bad jokes, and bad actors. It just seemed uninspired. The characters were unlikeable and there wasn't anything deep in character development throughout the first disc. I just kept thinking to myself, ""What are they doing. What is the point of any of this? How can the story be so boring?""This very well may be a great series, but it failed to capture my interest."
1,Slapstick and Stereotypes,"Based on an intrinsically interesting concept--the trials and tribulations of high school. However the execution is mediocre. Yes, the cast is physically attractive. But the characters and storylines border on stereotypes and there is a strong emphasis on physical humor (i.e. slapstick) Do not recommend for mature viewers."
5,Hilarious,"OMG this is a funny show. I wish it was never cancelled. Some really big actors in here before they were big. It is like an adult version of Wonder Years. James Franco, Seth Rogen, Jason Segel, Martin Starr and more. It is about a group of losers who spend all their time partying and not studying and their impact on a smart gal who has issues. There is also a group of young nerds (geeks) that interact. Very funny show. I like the extra's along with it. One of the best series."
5,Freaks & Geeks: Yearbook Edition,This was a gift for my son. Not easy to locate so I was happy to be able to order it on Amazon. Product is exactly what he was hoping for. Thank you!
1,Very overrated!,"The script really didn't make sense much and the show was kind of lame. Probably one of the worst shows on television. It's like watching The Wonder Years sort of except it was set in the 80's. The best show on television is Friends, The Simpsons, and Seinfeld. Those I would recommened but not Freaks and Geeks."
1,No closed captioning,"Great! No closed captioning again! Thanks a lot Shout!The first edition wasn't captioned and neither is this follow up!Lets all give big fat ZERO rating to Shout! on behalf of the hearing-impaired crowd! :(Yes, I'm talking to you Shout!, the producers of this video. Shame on you for not captioning this and nearly all of the other DVDs you release."
1,"Love the series, bad DVD!","All the extras are great, and I love the series, it is well written and well acted. Therefore, my comments here are not about the series, but the DVD.I have a hearing problem, and instead of turning the TV volume up, I just use closed captioning. Most DVDs do not contain closed captions files, and so they will usually use English subtitles. This DVD set does not have any features to accommodate the hearing impaired. The sound fluctuates significantly on these discs and so it was difficult to enjoy. I guess if you are deaf, you cannot watch this series at all."
2,Less freaky more geeky,"A precurser to the great series ' My so called life"" . More immature and less good acting. Good to watch before you watch mscl. Dont expect too much but amusing at times."
4,Good overview,"This is a great collection of heartfelt pop songs, however as it says it an 'uptempo collection' and therfore misses some of their finest quieter moments.I'd recommend getting Submarine Bells before this.Also i do need to point out to the previous guy that The Church were very much Australian."
1,Good danish - LOUSY delivery service,"After reading all the good stuff about O & H Kringles, I broke down and bought one. Delivery nearly doubles the price of the danish, which was troubling to me. My Kringle was supposed to be delivered on a Wednesday - I couldn't wait! Notice came that it had been shipped on Monday. Wednesday came and went - no Kringle. Thursday no Kringle, Friday, no Kringle. On Saturday morning, I went out on my back porch to dispose of trash, and laying on my back patio was a damaged Kringle box. UPS threw it over my locked 10 foot fence on to my back patio with no notice and with disregard to the 2 stickers on the box ""Fragile"" and ""Perishable"". I wrote O & H to complain, but received no response. Despite the fact the danish was tasty, I will not order again from them."
3,Politics and romance.,"When Beatrice Von Furstenberg refused permission for her 16 year old niece, Priscilla, to marry her 18 year old beau, Jeffrey, Priscilla had an idea. Put Beatrice in danger, then have Jeffrey rescue her. But Jeffrey is late and Beatrice is kidnapped and dumped in a brothel for safekeeping. Tammany-backed Congressional candidate Connor Barrow must rescue Beatrice while keeping everyong involved out of police hands. Beatrice and Connor find themselves becoming closer as they work for womens' right to vote and a woman-friendly bank.Plodding start despite interesting characters. The chemistry between Beatrice and Connor is forced in the beginning, only improving in the last half of the book. Tammany's acts are very accurate."
1,The worst RTS game ever made in history!!!!,This game is complete garbage. All the grachics they use in this game are recycled from the last game. Not even the old 8-bit Sega Genesis games would dare use the exact same graphics as the last game. And they did this 3 times. Some of the units in this game were used in the first game which was released almost 4 years ago!!! I have more money on my Ebgames Card than the budget they had to make this game; and it shows! Graphics that are below Playstation 1; poor sound; stupid gameplay; worthless new races. The biggest thing though is that all the concept ideas for this game were stolen from the Warhammer games. Go to www.gamesworkshop.com and you'll see what I mean. But the Brits thought this game sucked so bad they didn't even waste time sueing this guys.
5,Fantastic cabinet organizer,I used two of these in a home built kitchen pantry cabinet for the two upper shelves. They allow you to see the basket contents without being eight feet high.
5,Well made,You won't go wrong with this organizer. Very well made. Really built to last. I recommend this product to any one for their kitchen.
3,cabinet organizers,"We installed several of these in Mom's kitchen since she has arthritis and it makes it much easier for her to access everything. They work very well. We were especially impressed by the heavy duty wire guage and ball bearing glides. My only comment/complaint is that since these are installed in existing cabinets there is wasted storage space; about 3-4 inches on each side. This is due to the cabinet construction/style e.g. cabinet door width, not the organizers themselves."
4,Good textbook,"I was assigned this textbook in a class I took that was taught by James W. Mayer himself. Though we never used the book in the class, I read it myself and was quite impressed with it. The book is very understandable for anyone having taken freshman physics and chemistry in college. It gives a good introduction to the science and technology of semiconductors; emphasis on silicon and gallium arsenide substrates of course. The pages are chock full of figures and diagrams, and there is a lot of equations that are well-explained. Overall, a good textbook to use for learning about semiconductors."
1,Not a real puzzler,"There is no way for any mortal to logically work out these ""puzzles"". The book is a collection of cute stories that the author has broken into a teaser (the puzzle) and the story (the answer). Lateral, vertical, or upside down logic will not get you to the story.The book is only worth one star if you like cute stories and are not interested in logical deduction.I spent about half an hour trying to make some sense of the book before I tossed it."
2,Disappointing Phone,"Yes, I went with this phone 'cause of the TV feature. It is very hard to hear the TV if you're like in the mall, in a store, or outside with moderate to little traffic. It's best to have a headset if you're going to listen to TV. The speaker phone is just horrible. You have to turn it way down or you will get feedback and if you put the phone down, you will get feedback. Both you and the other person get the feed back. It maybe just me but I hate how I have to flip the screen up just to make a call.I have a LG C500 I believe is the model with Cingular and I liked how very easy it was to use. This phone is a little annoying to me. I only had it for 2 days and already am taking it back."
1,Save your money,"After using this phone for only 1 1/2 days my display screen broke-not on the outside but inside. Wireless carrier only offered to fix it for a $50 fee and manufacturer was of no help at all. I was told it was due to some sort of pressure impact and would be considered physical abuse. I can't believe they make such high dollar phones that have screens that will break by breathing on them. This phone was not dropped in any way, or banged on anything, yet I am the one paying to replace it after spending $200 on it to begin with. The sales clerk told me just bumping into something with it in your pocket or purse could break the screen. Maybe they should have encased it in rubber. I am VERY disappointed in this product and wish I could return it for a refund and get a different brand."
4,Great bedtime book,"A very cute story about a little boy who doesn't want to go to bed and the subsequent adventures he has while ""eluding"" his mother. My daughter enjoys it very much. Only complaint is that it's a paperback and therefore not super durable with a toddler."
1,"Good book, pages not in order -- now 5 STARS","Like the book but the pages were bound wrong so that they were mixed up inside. So what good is the book then?I want to compliment Amazon for their fast customer service. I was very disappointed about this and within a day, I got a new book that was stitched right. And my son just loves it now!Thanks to Amazon and it's a good book too."
3,A treaty of ecophilosophy,"The author develops the foundation of his nature-oriented philosophy with the traditional rigor, logic and method employed to describe new system of values. A bit harsh sometimes but philosophy demands that. For a more accessible and pragmatic artwork on the same subject, I would advise ""Small is beautiful"" by E. F. Schumacher."
3,This album got what it deserved...,"MANY AWARDS! This is a beautiful masterpiece made by first American idol Kelly Clarkson. I think the all-time best song off this album has to be ""Since You've Been Gone"", its lyrics can be related to by many people. One track I really disliked was, ""Because of You"", because it reminded me too much of Joss Stone, and was a bit too sad. Although not my favorite album in the world, it argued to become one thats always in my head."
3,Just what I expected,"Pretty much all of the good songs are already on the radio, but that's why I purchased it; because I liked those four songs. The rest is mediocre. You can tell which songs Averil Levigne wrote and which ones Kelly & friends wrote."
3,Fans can never be objective...,"From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...Even if you hate the whole American Idol crap, it's hard to ignore Kelly has some great tunes on this CD. Over played though it may be, ""Since You've Been Gone"" is great as a rock song, pop tune or dance remix."
4,Kelly Rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Kelly Clarkson has definitely had a great year! She has put out 4 singles that were all hits. I never thought someone who won American Idol were turn out to be this gigantic star! I love Kelly's music, it's awesome!! Here's my rating 5 stars being the best and 1 star being the worst.................1. Breakaway- *****2. Since You've Been Gone- *****3. Behind These Hazel Eyes- *****4. Because of You- ****5. Gone- ****6. Addicted- **7. Where is Your Heart- **8. Walk Away- ***9. You Found Me- ****10. I Hate Myself For Losing You- **11. Hear Me- **12. Beautiful Disaster- ****Go out and but this cd, if you don't have it you're missing out on some really amazing music!!!!!!!!"
5,Brilliant!,"Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous! My absolute fav! Kelly really outdoes herself on this one! Mrs. Clarkson rocks! My favourite is Behind These Hazel Eyes - they're all great though!"
4,Good album,"It did take me a while to warm up to this, however, it is good.Overall, I like it. It is bit commerical but mostly catchy. I also suggest getting these Hard Rock albums: Anastacia -""Anastacia"" & Pat Benetar-""Go."""
5,Breakaway from thankful,This cd is very different than thankful..its not only pop its pop/rock cd its great its like ashlee simpsons CD..must better then thankfulYou May also likeDiana DeGarmo ~ Blue SkiesFantasia ~ Free yourselfRuben Studdard ~ I need a angelAshlee Simpson ~ AutobiographyJojo ~ JojoLindsay Lohan ~ Speak
5,Kelly Clarkson Rocks,"wow! kelly clarkson deserves a grammy. the songs on this album are inspirational, meaningful, deep and addicting. This is impressive for a sophmore album. Props to kelly for not only her voice, but her songwriting skills which are obvious in this album."
2,this is so boring,i mean she sings stuff over and over again its fulled of fuller and it its just not good its so overrated to save ur ears and by something like speak or love angel music baby something with talant because this cd is overrated to don't get it for ur own safetylots of hatekaty
2,Phony Poser!,"If I hadn't seen American Idol, I would have no idea that Kelly Clarkson could actually sing. Kelly Clarkson is not believable as a rock singer. She sold out and is acting like a phony little poser like Avril Lavigne. She thinks she's a true punk, but she's just another fake from Texas. This is not Kelly Clarkson. What a loser. All my respect for her is gone and the music sucks too. The only good song on here is the live version of Beautiful Disaster. Other than that, Kelly has sold out and is just another fake pop/punk poser."
1,What an irratating racket!,"This really must be a sign of the times. It seems that musical talent completely vanished from this world circa 2000. The idiotic television program ""American Idol"" searched the entire United States for talented singers, and all they could find was this whiney, noisemaking nitwit. Kelly Clarkson is in close competition with Alanis Morisette and Avril Lavigne for the ""Screechiest Voice"" award. From the first strains of the awful ""Since U Been Gone"" until the final noises of the unspeakably bad last track, Kelly Clarkson wails at the top of her lungs. She sounds like a cat with its balls caught in a vice! The ability to sing extremely high notes does not make anybody a good singer. A large vocal range is useless when your voice is screechy enough to break glass! This is not even music, its just a bunch of angry yelling."
5,A CD that can be listened to begining to end...,"I'm glad to see that she didn't let the American Idol show turn her into a teeny bop star. She has an amazing voice and uses it wonderfully on this CD. Its a great mix of pop and rock... I really love ""Since You've Been Gone"" and ""Because of You"", although all the songs are great. I only bought it because of ""Since You've Been Gone"", but I found I actually like the whole CD, which I rarely do. If you're trying to decide whether or not to buy it... DO IT!"
5,One of the best idols ever!,I think Kelly Clarkson's voice is amazing! She has very good control and range. And I also think it's really cool that she wrote most of the songs on this CD. She's a very talented girl.
5,Preteen/Parent Car Music,I bought this to add to my daughters collection of CD's for long car rides. The lyrics are clean and the music is great which makes Mom happy. My daughter loves the songs and sings along to them which make her happy. As for my husband - he'll tolerate this girlie music.
2,......what genre?,Is Kelly Clarkson going to be a pop idol or r&b singer? This album wasn't bad but I only gave it two stars because I dislike when artist switch between genre's kind of makes me think they sing whatever sells even if it's not for them!
2,heard it before....,"After listening to this CD, my immediate reaction was that she's trying to be Avril Lavigne...who I happen to think is great....BUT...sorry Kelly....it's been done already...your new CD is good musically and vocally, but I've heard it before, and done better...was disappointed that you went this route instead of showcasing your voice more...and one more thing...what the hell were you thinking when you allowed that AWFUL photo of yourself to be on the cover of your CD???...one of the worst photos ever to grace a CD cover for sure!"
1,She could have done much better,"I loved Kell'y first album and could'n wait to hear this one. Well, since I already have Avril's, the real deal, I won't bother with Kelly's. She just doesn't carry the mean girl off.Sorry, Kelly, maybe next time."
1,Give me a break,"This is one of the many reasons why I hate TV. MTV, reality shows and most of all American Idol. That damn show spawned this crap by Kelly Clarkson and now her stupid album is in every music aisle in every store. This chick cant sing and her singles are played 1,293,402 times a day on the radio. Whatever is popular on the radio today, I hate! Except for Rob Thomas and 3 Doors Down. Sorry Kelly..... your album sucks!"
5,Very Talented Idol,"I was hesitant to purchase this CD because while I like Kelly's voice I was not overly found of her music. I finally broke down when I heard how successful it was. It is not album I would listen to every day but I do think it is top quality, good variety, and shows off her talented voice. It surpasses most of the music that is out there. Kelly, you did great!"
5,GREAT GIFT,"THIS WAS A GIFT FOR MY GIRL, I NEVER HEARD FROM THIS GIRL, BUT IT WAS A VERY NICE SURPRISE I LIKE IT VERY MUCH AN EXCELLENT ALBUM WITH VERY NICE SONGS, VERY FRESH. ABSOLUTELY RECOMENDABLE"
4,Okay,"""Thankful"" was a great companion to watching her on 'American Idol.' It showcased her voice and was a reflection of all the music styles she sang on the show. The problem with her most latest release is that too many of the songs sound similar. Her voice is still good... but it still feels like a rushed effort at times. A lot of the tracks seem like left over tracks from ""Thankful."" Avril Lavigne wrote the brilliant ""Behind Those Hazel Eyes"" -- a well crafted pop/rock tune. ""Since U Been Gone"" is simply okay. I hope Kelly Clarkson fans don't hate me for not liking this much as her first. I think it's our duty as fans to be able to critique her and not be forced to like every thing she does. I hope her next album will be a lot better."
3,Plastic Rock for the Masses,"The first three tracks are good songs, but the rest is throw-away.The CD is largely vocally oriented. The vocals are polishedand well produced on the first three songs, with niceharmonies. However, the instrumentation is rather basicand not real interesting. Beyond the first tree tracks,the tracks are not that well produced, leaving a piercing,grating sound to the lead vocals.If you're an mp3 fan, just buy the first 3 songs.If you looking for female vocalists with substance,check out Kathleen Edwards or Sheryl Crow."
3,Wow.,"Is it just me or does Kelly sound exactly like Avril???? It's almost as thought she's even copying her accent. What's with that?? Well, I still think Kelly's good, but I liked her when she was herself, not trying to be someone else. Someone who she is not."
2,"Listen to ""Thankful"" instead.","I loved ""Thankful"" and it's unique style, but this is nothing but ######' overdramatic ####."
3,Not bad!! This CD is much better than her first CD.,My only complaint was that some of the songs didn't sound like Kelly.
3,Where is the Soul?,"I loved Kelly Clarkson's blue eyed soul. While many will love the rock avenue of this effort, those who are looking for the soulful shouts from Miss Independent will be sorely dissapointed."
5,I love this cd,Im a huge music fan and this is one of my favorite cd my fav song is breakaway! this cd is worth the money and you'll be listing to it all the time
1,Pathetic,even in the reveiws you see it is a break-up cd and if you want one of those gets Ooops i did it again by a REAL artist who accually has talant!!!!!!!!!
2,Stop yelling at me!,"This girl used to have an ok voice when she was on idol but all she does these days is scream. The songs in this album all sound the same. I think she is just trying to hard. There are no Miss Independent type songs on this album. I suggest she puts down the rhyming dictionary, head over C. Aguilera's house and try to find some decent songs in her trash can. And for God's sake stop imitating Avril. One Avril is enough for this world!"
1,Welcome to the Suck,"Kelly Clarkson is probably the most important female artist in the history of music. Her music will continue to inspire musicians for generations to come. Oh, I almost forgot to mention that the first 10 million buyers get a free lobotomy with purchase, what a great deal."
1,Worst album by Kelly,"This album just sound like Avril's, the only song i like is ""Breakaway"". She should be back to her old self, I don't like Kelly who's trying to be a punk/rocker just to gain many airplay..."
2,Not bad for an above average kareoke singer,"She doens't write any of her own songs (a few lyrical lines don't count). She sings well enough but not that distinctively. She hasn't a clue how to move or generate any kind of excitement when playing live. I'm judging from her SNL appearance. She's a manufactured pop star whose fame is due to a TV reality show. She'll be forgotten as soon as her audience hits their twenties and gets tired of her or discovers real music. Kelly Clarkson's ""career"" is artificial. Her artless and prefabricated music was written only to make a buck and is completely disingenuous mind candy for teenagers. For people who actually play or like music and not just ""singing"" she is as important and entertaining as an average car commercial."
2,It's Okay and That's About It,"I've never been a fan of Kelly's, but she has some pretty good songs on ""Breakaway"" that all happen to be played on radio. You're just better off recording or dowloading, whichever is convenient for you. Other than that, I wouldn't pay any money for this CD at all. It's not that original and it's quite boring at times, which I find insulting. Since Kelly likes to ""rock,"" she should learn to play an instrument as well as get into some weight training and sit-ups, which she deseperately needs to do if she's going to be showing off her stomach like that."
1,Not bad,"Not too good though. Kelly sings good but the songs on Breakaway all sound the same. NO soul, no depth, no passion. If you want good pop/rock music, try another Idol."
3,Breakaway Clarkson,Kelly Clarkson certainly is a talented singer. I enjoyed her folksy sound and the instrumentals. I do believe her CD's could have been better if the instruments weren't quite so strong. She has a voice that could be as intense as Celine's if she's allowed to open up the pipes.
4,Nice,"Although im not a pop/rock music fan, Kelly Clarkson keeps on surprising me. Since her performance in 2005 MTV VMAs i was like 'omg she's amazing!', I never thought she would become this.. i mean, all those American Idol winners now are just nothing, but she went far, she made it :She's got this unbreakable energy when she sings, its like she feels every note, every verse, she actually lives the song ! I recommend this album, my fav tracks: Since You've Been Gone and Because of You ( this one makes me cry)."
3,Kelly Clarkson - Breakaway,"There's something about this album that makes me give it 3 stars. Besides the first 4 outstanding tracks, the rest of the tracks are just not at all catchy to me. Besides Breakaway, Since U Been Gone, Behind These Hazel Eyes and Because Of You, the rest are filler tracks to me. There's a reason why the producer put the 4 songs i mentioned in the first 4 tracks u see. To make you love the album before hating it. That's a trick i guess! Rock out Kelly..hmm..well..i like your voice, but definitely not this album. Im not sure if i like the involved Kelly either."
5,Kelly Clarkson - Best Idol in History!,"Wow! I doubt anybody will live up to this success. Every song outstanding. She is wonderful, her voice is so sweet."
5,Basically a great album,"This review is coming from someone in their mid-40s who only buys 2-3 albums a year and who does not watch American Idol (although that may now change). In fact, I didn't even know who Kelly Clarkson was when I starting researching to buy a new album. Basically, what I was looking for is an album that featured a good female lead vocal that has a pop-rock sound that is well produced. This album fits this bill to a tee.Kelly's voice sounds beautiful and has quite the range. However, unlike other performers such as Celine Dion, she doesn't try and overtake the songs. The ""band"" does a good job of balancing out the overall listening experience. Kudos to the producer.The first four songs are great. The rest are less memorable but not bad by any stretch and overall quite good. For me having that many great songs and no bad songs on one CD is rare so this album is worthy of 5 stars."
5,"Breakaway, Kelly Clarkson",1~ Since U Been Gone ~ Great 1st song on this album. Good beat to get you pumped up. Great song to dance to and also a good driving and sing-a-long song.2~ Behind These Hazel Eyes ~ This song lets Kellys passion come to the surface. You feel like you could yourself have went through something like this.3~ Because Of You ~ My favorite song on the whole album!!! This song has so much feeling and a good crying song.4~ Gone ~ Good beat. Fun driving song.5~ Addicted ~ Very deep song with lots of meaning.6~ Where Is Your Heart ~ This song reminds me of my younger years and learning to love.7~ Hear Me ~ Very passionate song.8~ Walk Away ~ I just have to sing along with this song everytime I hear it!! Good beat to dance with too.9~ You Found Me ~ Sweet song about finding new love.10~ I Hate Myself For Losing You ~ A song about making mistakes and wanting to change.11~ Beautiful Disaster (Live) ~ Beautiful vocals!!! This song showcases how powerful Kellys voice is.
5,Finally...Someone with some talent!!!!,"Kelly has always been my favorite from American Idol. Her range is impressive and she has great control over her voice. I liked Thankful, but this album far surpasses her first. While I don't own the CD yet, I have downloaded many of them. The live ""Beautiful Disaster"" is incredible...just a piano and Kelly's voice makes for a great combination. ""Behind those Hazel Eyes"" is also another favorite, despite the Averil influence, but Kelly manages to do something that Avril can't--keep the higher range as strong as the lower notes.This CD is a breath of fresh air, especially with the huge amount of talentless trash that has been put out recently (Ashlee Simpson comes to mind immediately). I'm looking forward to Kelly's next CD. She is a true talent and deserves to be at the top!"
4,Good Cd,I was surprised but I actualy liked this cd. I started learning the songs after listening once or twice. I like her sound except that I'm not into the rock type music. Kind of reminds me of something Ashlee Simpson in Gone and Walk Away isn't as bad that one. Is that an insult?
2,American Idle,"Her Idol Grammy snub was classless only in that she's another big voiced young girl as talented or not as a million other big voiced young girls who are actually nowhere without Cowell Inc.'s help. Sultry tones and hook-laden, this is quantum leap up from 'Thankful'. But her ambition is a big one, and she's not sure where she's going - from pop punk fury [Gone] to ersatz rocker chick [Behind These Hazel Eyes] to Top 40 turgid schlock [Because Of You] to dance-pop diva [Walk Away], the girl is all over the place. Her declamation at hipster relevance remains a teen-rock classic [Since U Been Gone], and when was the last time you hummed along to the only great waltz on the radio [Breakaway]? But I can only trust her aesthetics forgo her rock star objective or she might wind up in rehab with Courtney Love. By the way, where IS Courtney Love? My grade: B-"
2,eyes have replaced ears,"the day when a female pop singer NOT grace the cover of the cd will be a day we see big foot riding on loch ness monsters back while hunting for unicorns.the day a female pop singer not be be a videhoe is probably the same odds.pop music is what it is and for her part,i guess its ok.the days of real artists creating real music are over."
2,"Ok, who kidnapped Kelly?","Fess up. Those of us who voted for Kelly on the first season of American Idol are on to you. This isn't Kelly. Matter of fact, Kelly Clarkson has been missing for a very long time. This is an Avril/Amy Lee clone wanna-be and most definitely is not Kelly.Before this CD came out, I read an interview where ""Kelly"" (the clone she's been replaced with) said that this CD was going to be ""Janis Joplin without the drugs"". Dear clone, I have two words for you: Melissa Ethridge. Now THAT is Janis without the drugs. I'm sure the ""real Kelly"" knows that. Bring her back and put this clone away, please."
2,"Review for ""Breakaway"" by Kelly Clarkson","What happened to Kelly Clarkson? I never watched the first season of ""American Idol"" but as soon as I heard her amazing ballad ""A Moment Like This"", I ran out to buy the single and later bought the entire album ""Thankful"". Those were back in the days when Kelly Clarkson was classy, sophisticated, and showed off her amazing voice and range with a variety of music styles. But I guess today's punk culture got the better of her, and she trashed herself up to try and fit in with the wrong crowd. ""Breakaway"" is nothing but rock. Which is probably why 75% of the Caucasian pre-teen community fell in love with Kelly Clarkson after her song ""Breakaway"" was released. If you're a punk, go out and buy the CD as soon as possible. If you want to hear some real music, buy Ruben or Fantasia's CD instead."
2,This album is a hit...anyway,"I just don't get it. What's so good about this album? Alright, the first three songs were really good. Her best song is Behind These Hazel Eyes, I think. But what's happened to her voice at the rest of the album? Because of You sounds like the best of Mariah Carey meets Evanescence, actually more like the worst. Everything just starts going downhill from then on. Where's the Kelly who impressed me with her ballads during her 'Miss Independant' days. I think she's just trying to hard to revive her (almost) flagging career. (Did you know that she was nearly dropped by her record company?) Riding high on the pop-rock genre that has been shot to fame because of Avril Lavigne, Kelly proves that she's just a sell-out who will use absolutely anything to be heard on the radio, including changing her image into...a vamp! I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
3,Great Talent but...,"First off, let me say that, as a singer since age 6, I greatly respect Kelly Clarkson's talent as a singer. However, I was greatly disappointed by the generic pop/rock of this and her previous CD. I thought that we already had enough sub par pop music out there to fill everyone's tastes. Why didn't she go a different route? Who knows, but I must say that I wish she had taken her talents to a better realm of music. And to those of you who say she is the best singer in today's music scene, you need to widen your scope a bit. She is very talented, but holds nothing on such stelar singers as Josh Groban or Michael Buble. Sorry to dissapoint all you hardcore fans of Kelly, but there are many out there that are better, especially because she is in the pop realm."
3,It's Good,It's pretty good. But I wouldn't recommend it. The songs are overplayed and you'll soon hate em.
2,Disappointed,"Don't get me wrong, I am a HUGE kelly clarkson fan, I've seen her in concert and all, but I don't think these songs do her voice justice. Kelly has an AMAZING voice, but these songs are just horrible. I love Kelly singing rich, soulful ballads, but these songs are just morbid. I don't think rock is her type of music, it just doesnt go.However, her beautiful voice kept it from being 0 stars"
2,Amazing!,I think this CD is so amazing. I mean she wrote half of the songs on the cd and it is just so great her voice has never been better. Well done Kelly! I recommend this Cd to everyone that likes music.
1,Boring,"All of her songs are boring and have dumb titles. I will never listen to an AI singer. They're coperate puppets. I really don't see what's so great about her. Her VMAs performance was awful, all she did was jump up and down and scream into the microphone."
2,Kelly Clarkson?,"Ok, so I ask my cosin to burn a copy of this CD 'cause she got it for x-mas and I wanted it, I was shocked when heard Kelly on this CD, in case you don't no some of the lyrics have cussing in them. Songs like Addicted & (gasp) Beutiful Disaster livedon't get this for kids ever."
1,Unmemorable.,"Though I give her props for being a fat chick that has scored a music deal, this material is still incredibly bad and she is only successful cause she won a lame reality-based game show. Ed McMahon & Star Search was so much cooler."
5,"Wow! Great voice, and love the songs.","Kelly Clarkson, is probably the best singer. Her vocals are upbeat, and really good. They're not messed up. Her songs are mature, and I HIGHLY reccommed this for anyone.-Melissa"
5,A must have!!,"I knew before I bought it that this album went in a different direction than Kelly's first one. Knowing how great she sings, I was sure that I would like it anyway. Well, I was wrong. I love it!!!I hope Kelly gains new fans with this album. There are already about 4 or 5 songs on it that I love to listen to over and over. ""Because of You"" is my favorite, followed closely by ""You Found Me"".This is a really different sound for Kelly, but she sounds great and the songs are really good!"
4,Kelly's got my vote!!,"I am a huge fan of her first album and I love this one too. She is a little edgier and punk, but not crossing the line. In the first CD, she had more of a Christina Aquilera sound and now I am seeing a little Avril Lavigne in her! (I like Avril, so whatever!!) My favorites are: Behind these Hazel Eyes, Breakaway and Addited. Very kewl, you'll love it! Promise!"
4,Kelly's Still Shining,This album shows kelly's transitsion from American Idol's overnight sucess to a pop star. Breakaway shows that kelly has more to offer other than the pattern drawn for her for American Idol. This time around she has a more edgier sound which not only gives her an edge but also broadens her fan base. I bought this album after hearing kelly's third single Behind These Hazel Eyes which shows Kelly's Amazing Range. Iwas a bit suprised when she put out this second album because soon as the next American Idol contest begins the other Idol is often forgotten and written off but I think kelly did her thing on this album and a grammy is well deserved
5,EVERY SONG IS SO GOOD!,Its been a long time since I have bought a c.d. where I liked more than two songs. I really like every song.
5,wonderful,"if you have heard any of her singles, then you already know that you should have brought this album already. the whole album is great and the singles arent even the best on the album. my favorite being addicted."
5,Kelly's magnum opus ? Hoping not !,"This CD is an example of a real rarity these days... that being a CD that has more than one or two good songs, and this is one that grows on you and gets better every time you hear it. In fact my personal opinion is that the first 10 songs on disc one are worthy of calling this a crossover rock, pop, and even punk album. Not since Heart and Benetar was around has there been such a talent that could do this (IMHO). The girls got pipes! and traverses from sensual to searing with amazing ease.This definitely outshines her ""Thankful"" CD by light years! Missy K would do well to use the same producers, songsmiths, and musicians on her next project, as this was surely a winning team.Don't do like others have and go too easy listening soft now Kelly, keep knocking out some those kicking songs..."
5,Surprisingly GREAT CD!!,"I think this cd will blow everyone away. The emotion in both the lyrics and Kelly's voice make this one of the best cds I have heard in a while. It has a little bit of everything on it...from pop...to rock...to soulful ballads...everyone will find their favorite. Kelly keeps getting better with every effort and proves her artistry with both her writing and her interpetation of each song. The highlights for me were... Addicted, Hear Me, Because of You and Behind These Hazel Eyes. I highly recommend this cd!I also recommend that everyone click on ""other reviews from this person"" for all of the people that are giving this cd a low rating. You will find that almost every one of them is a Clay Aiken fan and in typical fashion are trying to sabotage the success of any other past idol contestant. They are a sad bunch and can not let go of the competition! The joke is on them becase Kelly has moved far beyond that show and Aiken with this cd."
5,THE BEST,"A fantastic album full of catchy and melodic songs, sung by the most spectacular voice in popular music today."
5,Kelly Rocks!!!,"This album is AMAZING! I love every song. She should get a grammy becuase it truly shows a side of of her that you didn't get to see on American Idol. She wrote many of the songs and they fit who she is. ""Because Of You"" is one of my favorites. It's so sad but beautiful at the same time. ""Since you been Gone"" and ""Behind These Hazel eyes"" are great. All the songs are perfect for Kelly and I really enjoy listening to this album. It's worth every penny!! A++"
4,album review,"For someone who enjoys mainly R&B/hiphop, I was surprisingly impressed. I heard ""Since U Been Gone"" on MTV Live, fell in love with the song and her voice so I thought I would give her CD a try. It's pretty decent - the first few tracks are better than the last few tracks but a great CD and a great voice. Again - surprisingly impressed."
3,What is this?,"Kelly Clarkson's new LP , ''Breakaway'' , sounds exceptionally like Ashley Simpson's ''Autobiography'', Lindsay Lohan's ''Speak'' and Avril Lavigne's records. Also , the video of ''Since U Been Gone''shows a different Kelly. She had claimed she would never ever EVER wear clothes like these. I guess she did everything she could so as to get more airplay... I cannot deny that the songs are catchy, but they are so fake... I hope Kelly can ''recover'' and find her old self and not try to live up to certain stereotypes (anger sells , sexy image sells etc.) I thought you were different , Kelly. I guess I was wrong..."
2,What happened to the good voice,"If you liked her voice in the past, you won't really find much of it in this CD. If you like loud, screaming, yelling, rock wannebe, you will enjoy it. If you want to hear good singing, a pretty voice, good control and music, you won't find too much of it here. An occasional song is OK, but most sound the same, low, high scream, low, high, yell."
3,Not better than her first.,"Kelly Clarkson's new CD is in no way compared to her first one. I liked ""Breakaway"" (which I recently found out Avril wrote) and ""Since You've Been Gone"" but that is about the only two songs I can stand on her CD. The old one I like almost every song. This is just a CD about a love that she has lost and getting away from her life. OVER AND OVER; look at the song titles it says it all. It is not one that I listened to past the two run throughs. I took the few songs I liked and put them on another CD so I could listen to them only and the rest of the CD collects dust in my room."
5,Kelly is amazingggg!!!,"OMG this cd is so amazing, and what variety! She isn't like that horrible lo life Carrie Underwood. SHe sings with emotion, thats why she remains to be the most successful idol."
4,Nothing Special,this album is good it has its good points but its definately very negative and abit depressing i like:Since U Been GoneGoneBehind These Hazel EyesWalk AwayYou Found Meonly less then half the album and thats bad i think its a alright album for a break-up mainly but otherwise not really any thing special and it can be topped by Under My Skin if you want real rock/punk/pop get that!!!!!!!
5,GREAT!!!!!,"You guys shipped my order so fast and I just loved it! I perfer to stick with you guys for a lot of stuff! About the CD, i love it! The only flaw is that the CD doesn't have Miss Independent. But thats ok...Thanks"
5,Best of the Best,Every song is great. You will want to here all of them over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. I really like Walk Away which I think will be a no. 1 smash hit everywhere.
3,"At last, the real Idol come (back, not really..)!","Since the single Breakaway aired for PD2:Royal Engagement, I 100% love.... it! So I hope it will be put into her next album because I don't really like the PD2 soundtrack. Now, I still love the single but not the album at all. Some track in the beginning and end of the album is good, but in the middle you'll get bored.Kelly herself is also an unique artist now. Looks like she traps between pop, rock, and hip music, but that makes this album such a great-listenable-exciting album for an AmIdol! If you like all the singles that release (Breakaway, Since U Been Gone, Behind Hazel, Because Of U)you should buy this one, but don't hope this will be a great and smooth album at all.."
2,Not impressed.,"The only good song on this CD is Breakaway. The rest of it is yuck. Unfortunately now that she has hooked up with that stupid Reba person, she'll probably start singing country music. Double yuck!"
4,"NICE ONE,KELLY!","I admit that I'm not a pop/rock fan,but Kelly's voice blew me away on this album.Her first single,Breakaway,is a really great laid-back tune.It sounds more like an adult contemporary track really.She gives her best vocal performances on the tracks""Since You've been Gone"" and ""Behind These Hazel Eyes"".Overall the album has pleasant songs such as ""Because Of You"" and many others.My verdict: She should work with Avril Lavigne more often on her future projects."
5,Crazzy!!!!!,"Kelly Clarkson is an amazing singer. Her vocals continue to stun many people worldwide. Her driven passion, hard work and talent continue to blow the minds of people. Kelly is truly a star and is pretty hard to top. Kelly Clarkson truly has talent!This IMPORT CD contains not only ""Breakaway"" but a Limited Edition Enhanced CD with 6 Live/Tracks and Remixes and 3 Music Videos and redone photography. This CD really is one of the best Pop CD's out there! The new photography that replaces the old photography is just icing on the cake! Kelly sounds amazing in all of the live tracks and remixes! This is the CD/IMPORT to buy! I reccomend it to everyone {especially if you love pop music and/or are a die hard fan of Kelly!} Rock on KC!"
4,Very interesting,I thought that this cd was very good with all her harmonys and i think that she worked very hard as she came from no-where and has become very sucessfull and popular! I think that if she perseveres then she will do well in the future and i wish her luck with that!By Dogbreath
1,poser!!,"I just want to start by saying I wish I could give this album no stars, because that's what it deserves. All the reviews saying she's going to be a genuine music star... well so was britney spears. This has NOTHING to do with talent in today's music industry. Kelly Clarkson is not a rocker, her music cannot be called rock/pop, and it cannot be differentiated from ""bubblegum pop."" She is actually the definition of manufactured pop. Kelly Clarkson is not artisitcally credible, as many people in their reviews are claiming. If you want real rock and roll, try Kings of Leon, Kasabian, Sam Roberts, or basically anything not from American Idol."
2,GARBAGE!,"wut the hell is wronq with you ppl? the only qood sonqs are her 3 sinqles, the rest suck! theyre borinq nd makes me want to jus turn it off. i think its crap! nd this is cominq from somebody who listens to everythinq.. rock, hard rock, soft rock (like old music), hip hop, rap, r&b, pop, techno, booty, reqqae, reqqaeton everythinq. my overal ratinq is a 2 jus becuz i loved her 3 sinqles - -- - SUBG, Breakaway, & Behind Hazel Eyes."
2,Good Album - But the Cover?!?,"Kelly Clarkson looks like an old bag lady on the cover of this album - what's up with that? ""Here my sweety, would you like an apple?"" NO - DON""T EAT IT SNOW WHITE. sheesh. Whoever put this picture on the album should be fired.About the only thing that's going to ""breakaway"" is this bag lady's old bags because all her worldly possessions are crammed in them. In fact, I've started referring to Kelly Clarkson as ""Baggy McBags"" or ""bags,"" for short.Maybe this album should've been entitled, ""I'm a bag lady that lives under the highway overpass."" If that was too long, how about just ""baglady."""
1,ARE YOU All INSANE!,"This is a horrible album. kelly clarkson is totally unbelieveable as a rock star. she makes avril lavigne look credible! she is very chubby and not very attractive yet i see all these glowing reviws! shame on you all! dont recommend this terrible album to others, its just not right!"
1,Stop singing please!,"I HATE this CD! Kelly can't sing! Bo Bice is the REAL DEAL and he's the best singer from American Idol!!! Stop lying Kelly fans, Bo is much better and he will outsell Kelly soon!"
5,"""Since U Been Gone"" Kelly, Its been worth the wait!","Kelly's album is the best. It surpasses Thankful, her debut album. All the songs are wonderful and wouldn't change them one bit. Anyone who has been a victim of love can relate to this album becuase she explains her expriences with almost all her songs. Kelly Clarkson is truly outshining the rest."
5,kelly kicks booty,kelly kicks booty thats all i have to say i love her old cd and the new one ROCKS even HARDER so hard it rocked my face off
5,Very Good album,"I didn't expect this to be as good as it is. I am 60, but I enjoy the songs on this album. I have no regrets in buying it."
5,Great CD,This item arrived very fast and was in perfect condition! Will do business with this person again. Thanks!!
3,Some great songs- but a lot of yelling,"There are some great songs on this one- ""Since you've been gone"" is a very upbeat, angst-driven, song. There there are ballads like beautiful disaster, and breakaway.There is definitely some great music here. Although, it must be said- that a lot of the songs are victimized, lover-spurned ballads in which Kelly yells the song. Next time, lets have atleast one positive....Behind there hazel eyes....the list goes on. Kelly has a beautiful voice and should not have to scream to be heard. It's still a great record- I am just looking for a little more from her, and hope the next album shows more variety."
1,Too bland to be likeable,"I do kinda like ""Miss Independent,"" but that song isn't even on this album. Think: if it weren't for ""American Idol,"" would Kelly be as big a star as she is now?"
3,kelly?,"the only song i enjoyed was since youve been gone, otherwise she is trying to hard, and she is trying to be a bit like Christina Aguilera. sorry but it's the truth."
3,alright music for a so called artist,"I don't like the cover, the music is alright, but how can she try to hide that mug of hers lol."
1,Kelly Clarkson is the best singer ever because SHE gets Copy Protection!,"Kelly Clarkson uses protection!Not sexual protection! CD protection!Apparently this is because her CD is so great, they're afraid people will want to rip the tracks and spread it across the Internet to lower the IQ levels of more unsuspecting Americans; perhaps even infect Europe and Asia.And as if it wasn't subtle enough, and you know, just in case you missed it the first time, Ms. Kelly is nice enough to drive the point home by posting THIS CD IS COPY PROTECTED on her website and having the page on Amazon read [COPY PROTECTED] at the top of the page.Hmm, I wonder if the CD is copy protected?"
3,Who is the real Kelly?,"I have to admit I hated everything about her initially: her career launch, her hair, her movie, her AWFUL music. I thought for certain she'd have her run and then the world would be done with her. But interestingly, the song ""Since You've Been Gone"" is actually kind of catchy. And you know what else? She looks pretty on her album cover, looking coquettish and all. She looks like she's dropped a few pounds! Good for her. But it may have all been premature: I saw her on late night tv the other night and she looked like she had raided the commissary and hadn't showered in a week.I've given this a few more listens recently and I must admit: it's pretty good. I never would have thought it possible, but the production is sharp and many of the cuts are alright."
1,TERRIBLE!,"worst cd ever! I bought Bo Bice's THE REAL THING and it's much better. Sorry Kelly fans, she's all done now that Bo's out."
1,Kelly - Breakaway,"Kelly Clarkson needs to return to what made her famous to begin with...her beautiful, powerful voice. The only song worth listening to on this album is Beautiful Disaster...showcases her talent. The rest sounds like the same song..different title. No originality. Sounds like she just threw some songs together. She is losing direction with her career. Use your beautiful voice and you will remain on top...continue with this venue and you will be a talent of the past."
3,quite good,"i like this album, but this really isn't as good as her last one. it's good that kelly is trying out new styles, but i guess rock songs are more suited for Avril Lavigne..."
1,What a drugged out tramp,"Blue Racer: Kelly Clarkson is a redneck who can't sing. Japanese Beetle: Serpent son, American Idols are all terrible. Blue Racer: her singing voice sounds like someone smoked half a carton of cancer sticks. Japanese Beetle: giving an American Idol a Grammy deserves a karate chop, HAASAH! Sayonara!"
5,Great surprise...,"I was very pleasantly surprised when I first listened to this CD. Having heard it had more of a rock vive than the ""Thankful"" CD, I was very curious to hear the change. Even though I was a little disappointed with a few Avril Lavigne sounding songs, it is an overall great album. I've listened to it every day since I got it and have no plans of stopping anytime soon. This is definitely a big improvement on what was already one of the greatest young singers around."
4,surprising,"i never really thought much of kelly clarkson before this cd. i asked a friend to buy it for me for Xmas cause i love the song ""since you've been gone"" (reminds me sooo much of my ex). i put on the cd and instatly loved it. i don't like every song on the album but most of them are awesome. even if ur not a big fan of her you should check this out. you might find an unexpected delight."
5,Definitely recommend!,"I was never a Kelly fan but when I heard the songs in this album, I liked it! I like almost all of the songs which is really good because usually when I buy an album of some singer, I end up liking only like 2-3 songs in it. >.< This one though is totally the opposite. I like all the songs except for maybe 1 or 2. :)"
5,Good Job Kelly!!!!,"Kelly Clarkson's new cd Breakaway is a breakaway from her first cd. It is a wonderful cd to listen to. It is in my cd player in my vehicle and has not come out since I got it. I just can't get enough of it. I love Behind These Hazel Eyes and Gone. Hope these become singles. Walk Away is a fun song to listen to. Makes you want to get up and dance. Love the new stuff Kelly.Thanks, Blaine"
5,The album is smoking,The girl can sing. She seems to be coming into herself on the songs on the album.Her voice is beautiful. That is clear watching Vh1 live.Go support her!She is not a studio singer. She can really sing.
4,Lots of growth,"Thankful was decent, if often uninspiring - but on Breakaway, Kelly truly does break away from the American Idol stigma. Her voice is more controlled, and the ballads, especially ""Because of You,"" are very affecting. She shows she can rock out, too. It's an album that could get you through tough times romantically, and you can't say that about many pop albums nowadays. Celine Dion, Christina Aguilera, and Mariah Carey should be given a lesson from this album."
5,"""Breaking Away"" From American Idol","Kelly Clarkson started off with her debut album titled Thankful. Now she has come out with a sophmore album called Breakaway. This album is much different from the first. It has a difinitive rock edge but still sticks with her flare for soul. Songs such as Behind These Hazel Eyes, Gone, and Walk Away have become my personal favorites on this album. With the help of a couple members of Evanenscence, it is reminiscent of their sound. This album is definitely worth buying. Enjoy!"
5,Breaking into the rock sound,"I enjoyed this album during my senior year in high school. I loved it and I still do. This record was her next step in artistic evolution. The album has more of a ""rock"" sound than her debut. She wrote 6 songs on this album. She wanted to follow her artistic impulses. She is, of course, a writer and an artist with a vision of her work. This album has been certified 6x Platinum."
5,Glad,So glad I was able to find this CD. It may stay in my car cd player for two weeks out of the month. I love Kelly Clarkston!
5,outstanding debut,"Still one of my favorite American Idol singers.She has a very pleasant voice and this CD is more than just radio pop music.Has 4 solid hits: Breakaway, Since U Been Gone, Because Of You and Walk Away.And has a couple of lesser played hits: Behind These Hazel Eyes and Hear me.With this many hits I actually recommend buying the cd.Great used if you can find one in good shape."
1,Indistinct,Kelly sounds like most of the other pop tarts out there on this CD which makes sense since she seems to be going after the tweenie market. I liked Thankful much better.
2,Break,"That should be the name of the of the CD.There is no doubting the girl has mad talent, but it is only shown on three songs in this Cd.That not good.Personally If she keeps giving her fans this nonsense, the girl will not last in this industry."
1,and the worst EVER idol album is....,"what a disaster! kelly mismashes the sounds of avril, ashlee, amy and hillary to make this atrotious fake-pop-rock mess of a album. she is so unbeliveable! How can she expect anyone to take her, this former reality show contestant, as a legitimate rocker! she needs to go back to making enjoyable manufactured pop and leave the manufactured rock to the more talented singers."
1,"SCREAM, SCREAM AND MORE SCREAM!!!","Don't look for any ""Moments Like This"" on this CD. There aren't any. It is pure rock noise! My ears still haven't recovered."
1,Too emotional,"Kelly really needs to get over singing about the same-old same-old. Almost the entire album are songs about her lost loves, and it gets extremely boring, very quickly. She's not bringing anything new and edgy to the table. This will probably be the end of her career."
1,........,"Kelly Clarkson is not rock. Don't let anyone tell you different. Just because her brand of pop features the occasional guitar riff doesn't make it rock. Shame on all you who said she sang rock. You make it sound like you think Avril Lavign is punk or something. I'm giving you all the benefit of the doubt there, even though there's a good chance that her hardcore lyrics (Sk8r boi? I'm sorry, but the punk music I listen to can spell), grinding guitars, and awesomely punk fashion attire may have tricked you. Now, back to the idol in point...Kelly Clarkson loses major points for not writing her own music, as well as major points for singing terribly boring, unoriginal music. In fact, she has no points at all. If you're looking for good, actual rock fronted by a female, check out Tsunami Bomb or the Soviettes..."
1,DeanoDeano is NOT from 'Manchester',Just to point out that DeanoDeano has nothing to do with 'Manchester' (a grimy city in the Midlands of England) but is in actual fact a writer/producer who hails from Hilversum in the Netherlands.DeanoDeano of course attracts immitators - BE WARNED!
1,It must be easy being Kelly Clarkson.,"Kelly Clarkson wrote just four songs on this CD. It is apparent to me that she has little or no musical talent whatsoever, and is therefore forced to rely on other people to write her songs for her. If Kelly Clarkson wants to sing other peoples' songs, she should stay in a karaoke bar, instead of taking credit for the songs and making money off it. I remember when artists were encouraged to write their own music, but unfortunately that memory is fading too rapidly. Ms. Clarkson should stop masquerading as a musician and step aside for real ones."
5,"Breakaway, indeed.","I've never claimed to have amazing musical taste but thereare a few times in my life where I've gotten chills whenI listen to an album. Tina and Ike Turner were the first.Mary J Blige ""What's the 411?"" was the second. Elton John's""Honky Chateau"" was the third. Alicia Keys "" Diary of.."" wasthe fourth. C-Lo Green "" Is the Soul Machine"" was the fifth.And now Miss Kelly Clarkson takes the sixth place of mostinfluential albums of my life. Strange to share that I know.Or that I even rate albums. But really this album is amazing.I can't get enough of it. Someone hurt her and she is channelingthat hurt through her music. Its brilliant to hear. Overbearing producers are gone. Its just Clarkson's voice, and thats spectacular in and of itself.Clarkson also hit #3 on the charts.Not a bad sophomore effort starting point! ;)Give it a try. You'll be happily surprised."
5,You Go Kelly!,I was very pleased with Kelly Clarksons album. Kelly is what turned me on to American Idol!
4,H Andersen,"This is a great CD, Kelly Clarkson is very talented and it's a very diverse CD, different types of music and very soulful."
4,First 4 Songs are great Pop Songs,Kelly Clarkson is the first American Idol winner. This album is her second. The best songs are stacked toward the front of album. The first four songs are great pop songs that are fun to listen to. This makes it a lot better than those one hit wonders. My daughter also likes songs #5 and #8. The rest of the songs are okay.
4,"OK, here's the deal...","I'm the one review with the one titled ""ughh..' and i gave it three starts. If you go up and click on 1,148 reviews or something like that, then you can read it. I've listened to it more often now and it's started to grow more on me. That one guy, Aidrain or however you spell it ( i don't care) said that i should grow up. Just because i said she cusses in it. Well, at least I'm the only one that mentions it! But i must stay, i like it better than i did before."
4,"Surprise, Surprise...","I bought this cd after hearing ""Since You Been Gone"" on the radio. I didn't expect to like the rest of the cd as much as I do, but it is really awesome. Because of the whole American Idol hype, I don't think I gave Kelly Clarkson enough credit. Anyone who is contemplating buying this cd - do it. There is a good variety of sound on here (in my opinion) to fit whatever mood you're in. And she's not just out there to shake her you-know-what like some other female singers we know of, she's actually got real got talent."
5,Excellent,This album is even better than the first. The songs are fantastic. By far the best idol album yet!
1,Kelly? What the heck?,"Your first album was amazing... but what is this junk you call a sophmore album? every song sounds like something avril lavigne would sing! you are KELLY, NOT AVRIL. No wonder people are so hyped up about this album... it's a bunch of MAINSTREAM ""i'm angry at the world"" pop/punk/rock music since it's ""THE COOL THING TO LISTEN TO"". Avril is pathetic... you need NOT follow her footsteps. I still love you no matter what, but stick with a formula that would work for you. This album is sooo ""LOUD"" that i'm convinced over and over again that you're SCREAMING instead of SINGING to me. Hopefully, you'll learn from your mistake."
1,Raunch,"How sad that Kelly could not stay true to her ""beautiful voice / good girl image""I saw her on Saturday Night Live and she looks like TRASH and she acts, sounds and looks like Avril (NOT a compliment)She doesn't even sound like the Kelly of ""Thankful""The girl has no compunction to sell her self out for money and fame. Sad.BOOOOO!"
1,Breakaway....to Imitate,"I am amazed at how much people like this album...for god's sake it's a BREAKUP album! If you want to listen to seven songs about the same thing, then buy this cd. If you want to listen to Avril Lavigne, then buy this cd. It's the same type of music and the same style of songwriting and singing...pathetic.P.S. did you notice Kelly's new dye job at the VMAs??she looks just like Britney...and Jessica...and Avril...and Lindsay...and....you get the pointall filler no killer!DON'T BUY!!!"
2,So what?,"Alright, I think that kelly Clarkson is just turning- or trying - to turn into Avril Lavenge which she will never acomplish because Avril is an awesome musician who actually plays along while she sings. The first time you hear Since You've Been Gone, its really super meaningful but afer that its just boring.I wouldn't spend my money on this CD if I were you. Yeah, If you are a super pop fan then go ahead but I think its a rip off."
1,Future elevator music,This bottom fed garbage will be the MUZAK you listen to when you're in your 30's and go to the grocery store.
5,WoW! I CAN'T STOP LISTENING......BEST CD EVER!!!!,"I KNEW FROM DAY ONE (RESPECT AUDITION) THAT THIS GIRL WOULD BE A HUGE SUPERSTAR, AND NOW EVERYONE IS ABOUT TO SEE FOR THEMSELVES. THERE ARE AT LEAST 5 #1 HITS ON THIS ALBUM WHICH ARE THE FOLLOWING:1. HEAR ME2. WALK AWAY3. ADDICTED4. I HATE MYSELF FOR LOSING YOU5. GONEBUT, THE REST ARE GREAT AS WELL. KELLY CLARKSON IS SOOOOO UNIQUE BECAUSE SHE CAN CONQUER ANY STYLE OF MUSIC WITH PERFECTION SUCH AS: R & B, POP, ROCK, COUNTRY. KEEP MAKING THE HITS KELLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS CD IS MUST HAVE."
3,Breakaway Is A Decent Second Album,"I think Kelly is one of the more talented American Idols to come off of the show. She has a great voice and tremendous range. Sure she has been made over/glamorized for the pop masses and has this new image, more edgier and rock. I listened to the album from front to back and found that the best songs were the ones I had already heard on the radio. Breakaway, Since U Been Gone and Behind These Hazel Eyes are great songs to listen to. I also enjoyed Because Of You, You Found Me, and Beautiful Disaster (such a nice way to close the album-Amazing!). Everything else didn't appeal very much to me. Like some of the other people said they are just filler songs. I gave the album 3 stars because I liked only about 50% of the songs. But Kelly still has a great voice."
5,KELLY BREAKSAWAY!,"This CD is amazing. There are several songs that feature Kelly's vocals and show her depth and versatility as an artist. Some great songs include ""Since U Been Gone,"" ""Addicted,"" and ""Where Is Your Heart."" This would make a GREAT Christmas gift!"
3,ughh......,"I wasn't too disappointed with Kelly Clarkson, but what i didn't like was the way she tries to rapp in some songs. She sounds too winy. I had never been a true Kelly fan, but I did like Breakaway and Behind These Hazel Eyes, so I decided to try her CD. Most songs sound alike with pop beats. I would get rid of Because of You (she cusses in it)Where is YOur Heart, (lame melody) and Beautiful Disater. ( She doesn't sound too good in it and she cusses too.) Other wise, without those songs, it would be a 5 star CD!"
3,Great Voice - Average Album,"There is no doubt that Kelly Clarkson has a great voice, and her performance on 'Because of You' is as good a pop performance as I have heard in many a year. The problem that I have with this album is that I am not sure as to what she wants to be - Rock-Chick? (Since You've Been Gone), Pop-Chick? (Breakaway), or Soul-Chick? (Beautiful Disaster)....The album is well-polished as you would expect with producer Clive Davis at the helm but the complete collection of songs are just average with 2-3 gems thrown in. An average album from a great voice...Maybe her next offering will tell us more about the real Kelly Clarkson."
5,nice job a review from kevin f,this cd is better then her debut cd some songs in this cd are not good but overall this cd is good
2,Meh...It's just there...,Kelly Clarkson's first CD was definately much better then this one. This one sounds as if she's trying to copy Avril Lavigne. And I personally don't think her voice is suited for this style of music.
5,It is so awesome,At first when kelly clarkson won american idol i was like o great another winner yippi (yeah right!) But as i started listening to her songs and seeing her music vidoes kelly clarkson became my most favourite singer!!!! Know i want all of her c-d's!! I recomend the song behind these hazel eyes. It shows lots of dramma and connfesion you also see how she can use her voice. Go KELLY
2,I only bought this because she won Idol,"I had to buy the CD after she won American Idol. I've never really become a very big fan. She's basically a pretty face, but not that talented afterall."
4,Very Surprising!,"CD: BreakawayArtist: Kelly ClarksonComments: This CD is very well recorded, all the songs are very catchy, and lyrically well put together. I gave this project 4 stars only because a lot of the songs sound kind of similar, and with her amazing talent, I wanted to see her try lots of new things. Her vocals, though, are outstanding."
5,Great,"This is a great CD. She has one of the best voices in the industry at the current time, and I would not be surprised if Miss. Clarkson got nominated for a couple Grammy's at the 2006 ceremony. The highlights include: Because of You, Addicted, Gone, Breakaway, Since U Been Gone, Behind These Hazel Eyes, and Hear Me. An impressive sophomore album from this rising star."
4,A Surprise,"I was surprised when I heard this CD over a friend's house the other day. Kelly Clarkson has a real genuine voice. There is no put-on here. She can really sing and very well. Most of the songs are good, they sound good that is, and I liked the way she delivered them. She has genuine depth and warmth as a vocal artist."
5,This cd is great!,"I am still in love w/ ""Thankful"", so when I heard ""Breakaway"" was going to have a more rock-type song, I was slightly skeptical. I had my fingers crossed though that Kelly was going to prove herself to be more than just the ""American Idol"" and I was proved right..when I did get this cd, I was blown away! The rock sound is just enough to give kelly an edge but it's none of the ""trying to too hard to be someone i'm not."" I love the ballads from ""Because of You"" to the upbeat tunes ""You Found Me,"" and ""Breakaway"" has been my personal anthem for the last few months. The lyrics were perfect for people like me, facing change (going off to college) & was ultra inspiring. I was also in awe at ""Beautiful Disaster"", because it is absolutely amazing live & just a beautiful song. I'm a music chemleon, so usually I rotate cds like crazy, however ""Breakaway"" has been in my stereo consistantly for the last few weeks & isn't being changed anytime soon!"
5,FANTASTIC !!!!!!!!,Kelly Clarkson takes her place among the best female rockers of all time with this terrific Album.Don't miss this one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Worth your money!,"I thought that this album only had a few good songs on it. Well, the whole album is GREAT! My favorite song is Since U Been Gone! Her voice is very powerful in this album. The only reason why her song Breakaway sounds like Avril Lavigne, is because Avril co-wrote the song with Kelly! DUH PEOPLE! If you haven't bought this album yet, and are thinking you should. DO, BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!! It is definatly worth your money and time listening to."
2,unremarkable album,"There is nothing to make this album stand out from the other ""female rocker wannabees"". Her voice is pleasant enough but the lyrics are very lame at times and she lacks the emotion and rawness of true rock artists. I am rather stunned with the glowing reviews as I see her voice more suited for other styles of music. I love rock but I find this album very ""unremarkable""."
2,"Good singles, the rest? not so much","All i can say is that i'm glad i listened to the album BEFORE i bought. Since U been gone, behind these hazel eyes and breakaway are all great pop songs. The rest of the album seems to go downhill from there. it just isn't as catchy as those three songs. I'm such a sucker for pop-rock music, but mz. clarkson really misses the mark on this one. Download: Since u been gone and behind these hazel eyes if you want the TWO best tracks on this CD. The rest are pretty interchangeable (omit breakaway, which isn't pop-rock, but more pop-ballad). Hopefully kelly will be able to give us a more solid release on album # 3."
1,1 good song that's all!!,"Because of U is pretty good, rest is pitiful. BUY BO BICE""S new music and see what REAL singing is!!!!!!!!Bo's sold more than Kelly so what does that tell you who is better, ha!"
5,Must Have Album!!,"This is such an amazing album! All you people who think she sounds like Avril need to get a hearing check. No offense to Avril fans, but Kelly has a much better voice. This cd is musically, vocally, and lyrically intense and passionate. Kelly wrote half the album and she wrote Because of You when she was 16. By the way Avril only wrote ONE song on this album. It is one of the only cds that I own that I can actually listen through the whole cd and never skip over a song, thats how good it is. I think the three best songs on this album are either Where is Your Heart?, Hear Me, or Because of You. This is a fabulous album that I think everyone can enjoy. Kelly really showcases her voice beautifully on this album. Thankful, Kelly's first album, was light and airy. Breakaway, on the other hand, is more powerful and deep. Everyone needs to buy this cd!"
1,Sadly disappointed,"I loved the first album by this singer but am very disappointed in this one. I feel this CD is very derivative and other than one song (Beautiful Disaster), doesn't highlight her voice to it's best. I really hate that someone with a unique talent feels it necessary to become an Avril/Amy Lee/Jessica clone instead of herself."
3,Mixed Feelings,"I've been a casual fan of Clarkson since AI1. I enjoyed Thankful immensely. Breakaway for me has about 4 good songs, but I can't say that I enjoyed the rest that much. Breakaway, Since U Been Gone (even if that the spelling in the title grates), Beautiful Disaster and Behind these Hazel Eyes are the standouts on the album. You Found Me is okay. The rest I easily skip. I listened to them several times to try and get a 'feel' for the the songs I didn't care for, but my feelings didn't change after subsequent listenings. I will say that if you are a fan of Avril Lavigne, or perhaps the Michelle Branch sound, you will probably like this cd. If you are not, then you may not enjoy this new sound from Kelly. If you expect material like Thankful, then you might be disappointed. It honestly didn't seem very original to me. It sounds like everyone else out there now. For some that will be good, for others, not so good."
2,Three Awesome Cuts...,"The pop hit ""Breakaway"" is just such a happy upbeat tune, and the hauntingly stunning live version of ""Beautiful Disaster"" is such a gem, and the flat out rock-on ""Since You've Been Gone"" is a sure hit, but the rest of the disk was unimpressive. It's not due to Kelly's voice which is awesome, it's due to some overproduction. Frankly, it's a bit of a let down. Kelly is worthier of much better studio work. The 3 songs I like just don't take the whole CD to even a three star level."
1,rubbish fake rocker,she thinks she is all ROCK when she is sooooooooooo fake and rubbish DO NOT BUY THIS CD IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY she has only written like 3 of the songs on this album and she does not even play any instrument DO NOT BUY!!! BUY SOME REAL ROCK
1,"bad job, don't pay for junk, buy Bo's quality instead","Kelly just screams, no singing on this cd!.Songs are so boring and she doesn't stay in the right key!Save your money and buy Bo Bice's new AWESOME, AMAZING, album called The Real Thing! Bo will show you how it's done! Bo's the REAL DEAL folks! Bo blows all the other Idols who ever went on the show out of the water, makes them look real bad, yuck for Kelly, hope she gets better, tell her to call Bo when she's out of a job. Bo ROCKS!!"
1,Please make it stop,"Hey record companies, don't you think it's a little late to be manufacturing your own version of Avril Lavigne? This CD is such a cliche...monotone vocals that explode into raging screams, ""chunk-a-chunk-chunk"" guitars, and whiney lyrics about how miserable life is. Don't worry though, pop culture trends die out quick. Avril, Kelly, and all those other noise making brats will be back delivering pizzas and flipping burgers before you know it."
1,"Used to love her, no more, no good","Kelly USED to be my favorite but then I saw her in concert. Kelly has trouble with her voice and she needs to take a long break or she will lose her voice! Rest up Kelly!I dont' see why anyone will buy this CD when half of it is on the radio anyway. GIVE A REAL ARTIST A CHANCE AND SUPPORT BO BICE'S THE REAL THING!!C'MON KELLY FANS, ENOUGH OF HER, TIME FOR BO, HE'S SOOOOOOO HOT!! Bo is the BEST IDOL EVER, PUTS KELLY TO SHAME!! Poor Kelly."
5,Got Me Through A Rough Time,"Every once in a while an album comes along that really captures the listeners emotions and feelings and this is that album, when it came out I was going through a bad time and playing this album got me through it for which I am thankful to Kelly for. The songs on this CD really are amazing right from ""Breakaway"" to ""Beautiful Disaster"" there's not a song on here I don't like. I have a varied taste in music with not a lot of time for X-Factor/American Idol but Kelly Clarkson has really struck a chord with me her voice is so powerful and she's gorgeous. This album is essential to any CD collection."
4,KELLY CLARKSON IS THE REAL DEAL!!!,"Over and over in these reviews I keep seeing teenage reviews comparing Kelly and Avril... Lets first get this straight... Avril is ok... shes being marketed by her record company as a little rebel girl and lives up to that image. Ok, with that said.. Kelly Clarkson doesnt have to fit some image that her record company is marketing her under because her voice, her presence, her style speak for themselves... Kelly Clarkson is the real deal and showed it by winning out over thousands who wanted to be where she is now. There is a reason she won American Idol... The new cd Breakaway is every bit as good as her first solo effort on Thankful. What you get on the new cd is a collection of great songs sung beautifully by an artist who will be around long after the teen angst skater girls have faded away. If its talent your looking for.. Kellys your girl.. and this is your cd. Buy it!!!"
5,I love Kelly!!,"This is my favorite album in many, many years. I love all kinds of music, but have not been this excited about a female artist in a long time. Kelly has come a long way since American Idol. I saw her with Clay Aiken on her Independent Tour and thought she was okay. And now with Breakaway, I am one of her biggest fans. My teenage daughters love her, too.Her voice is so beautiful and I love her song choices. Every song on this CD is a hit. There are no throw-aways."
4,Break Into A good Cd,"This cd surpasses Miss Clarkson's first cd, which I thought was impossible. One thing that I didn't like about this album was she didn't show off her voice as much as in the first, but the album still rocks. It is very refreshing to hear an artist that can actually sing, and you know she won't be lip snyncing anytime soon(very rare in the ""pop world"") All in all I recommend this cd to anyone that isn't tone def. You'll enjoy it!"
5,Beautiful album,"Clarkson really sings great, I've been listening to it for months. Behind these Hazel eyes is stunning. And since Youve Been gone shows she's really grown up. Kelly Clarkson, Jewel, Corinna Fugate, Avrril Lavigne...and Amy Lee are all good singerrs."
5,The Perfect Album,"Kelly Clarkson's Breakaway is truly the perfect album. It has a little bit of every type of music. Breakaway is an amazing song with great vocals and range, Since You Been Gone is a hard rock song wich is very difficult to sing, yet Kelly does a great job. Behind These Hazel Eyes is also a fantastic song. Because Of You has amazing lyrics and vocals. Gone is a powerful song vocally. Addicted also has meaningful lyrics and vocals. Where Is Your Heart does as well. Walk Away is outstanding, and You Found Me is completely incredible. I Hate Myself For Losing You has great lyrics and vocals. Hear Me is a very good song, and like all of Kelly Clarkson's songs, the vocals are unbelievable. The final track on the album is called Beautiful Disaster. It is the live version that Kelly sang on the finale of American Idol Season 3. That is a fantastic song as well, and you will love it no matter what type of music you like."
3,A little too much $$$...,"This is a very good book about MSU football. With that being said I felt I paid too high a premium for a small, soft-covered, black and white photo book."
5,Incredible!,"In only her first book, which I picked up on a fluke, this amazing author has miraculously turned me onto the ways of poetry and has effectively created and organized an inspiring and powerful collection of quality works. Sometimes I read it cover to cover, sometimes I skip around and read my favorites, and sometimes when I need a lift I pick a page and see what turns up. I eagerly await Ms. Rodriguez's next book!"
5,Principles and methods of sheetmetal fabricating,"This book really helped me get a grasp on my career as an apprentice in the HVAC industry. It was very definitive and to the point, with wonderful illustrations to guide you through the text."
2,Disappointing mono reissue,"Still being in possession of my old 1969 German vinyl copy in spectacular stereo, I am rather dissappointed with this mono digital reissue. Hip-O should tell the customers what they actually get. Although the artwork is exemplary (thick paper sleeve), 2 stars only."
3,Holy Mono CD Robin,"Wow what a neat package this comes in and also a ""Ltd"" edition of ony 5000.Cool little fake A&M; inner sleeve ca.1970Stereo printed on cover in the A&M; logo box.Oh , the CD is in MONO.Maybe it should have stated that the cd was mono somewhwere.Back to mono yeah I know blah blah blahBoth of my ears still work.I remember seeing an A&M; cd of this in a used bin at Record Theatre in Buffalo and didnt buy it.This was my second chance,or so I thoughtMB"
1,It's not that great at all...,"I purchased this based on the reviews here, but was very disappointed. You can see globs of hot glue on the ship and the stand is slightly off center, so it's crooked when you sit it on a shelf. Had I seen this in a toy store, I would not have paid 20 dollars for it."
4,"Isaac Brock? No, wait, it's Ryan Murphy.","Somewhere between Her Space Holiday and Modest Mouse, Havergal is Ryan Murphy (from Texas)...but seriously...try not to mistake him for Isaac Brock! If you can get over that, you'll like this better. ""Lungs for the Race"" is a really good debut full-length which shows mellow, well-crafted creativity... the perfect blend of electronic and indie. The sound? Static-y with a drum machine and other lo-fi electronics. It ranges from melodic to dischordant at times. There are two instrumental tracks but the rest have lyrics. Besides Murphy's voice, this album is really quite unique, and I recommend it if you like creative, slightly electronic, bedroom-pop, mellow, indie tunes."
1,This thing is a joke time for an upgrade,"This thing is such old news and i can't beleive it costs 30.00 bucks. I was recentlty at a hobby show in toronto, canada and i bought a new electronic magetic dartboard. I bought 4 of them and they were only $49 bucks. It looks like a real dartboard and the amazing thing is it calculates the score for you. [...] that is their website. This item is a must have for christmas.Safety darts magnetic ad it keeps score electronically."
1,do not order this item!,"not only is the customer service non existent, but the product is not great. I would look for another fence for your money!"
1,don't waste your money on this,"Poorly made, gaps between the slats are as wide as the slats themselves, so offers very little privacy. You can find a superior product significantly cheaper at the local home supply store."
1,wrong advertising,"photo does not show size of bamboo!!! you should be more specific!!! 13' x 6'.6 x 1/2"" I don't return the item but i express my advise to other customers about this wrong advertise!!!"
3,Amazon Bamboo Fencing,Excellent size & coverage for the price! I ordered it to cover a railing & add privacy to a fence & it works great!
3,"Ok, but not supper either for beginner or tech",This one is acceptable if you like to pay double time to get one stuff. Something is not well-organized but fortunate is you can pick 'em up by time.
2,Do It Yourself Family,I found it rather childish for an adult book and actually it would be hard for even a child to relate to.
1,Not Compatible with Taylor Digital Thermometer,"Searched for Taylor thermometer probe, this was the first item listed. When I selected this item, the Results showed ""Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought"" Taylor Digital Thermometers. I read that this replacement probe worked with multiple brands.The Taylor Digital Cooking Thermometer didn't recognize the probe.I didn't want someone else having to order this probe if they intended to use it with a Taylor Digital Cooking Thermometer.Taylor Digital Cooking Thermometer with Probe and TimerThis probe looks like it is very well built."
3,Fragile but accurate,"This is my fourth replacement and while I really like the overall unit, these probes can't take any significant heat. Don't let it touch anything other than your meat and don't leave it in a covered grill for long because it melts!"
4,AD-DTP392 Replacement Probe,"After reading other reviews, I took a chance and ordered this probe to replace the one from my Weber therometer, which I believe is the same as the Oregon Sientific. I recieved it the other day, plugged it in and bingo! my thermometer works like new. My original got toasted by a grease flare up, and with all of these they have a temp limit, so watch it. This one's temp limit is 400 deg F. I haven't used it enough yet to know how long it will last, but I'm sure it's disposable like all the rest so order 2 or 3 and when the enevitable happens you'll be back in business in a flash. Happy Cooking!!"
1,NOT FOR THE BBQ,"Bought as a replacement for a cheap Walmart wireless thermometer that was caught in the flame. This seems like a perfect replacement, but it consistently undercooks meat in my three outings, and today I figured out why. It tested a perfect 212 degrees in a pan of boiling water, but evidently picks up BBQ heat far from the tip, and reads high. In a 400 degree BBQ, two inches into chicken, it read 15-30 degrees too high! In tri-tip, even pushed in about three inches, my medium rare reading was actually bloody. In a sirloin, pushed in over three inches, the medium rare reading was quite rare."
4,This one's worth the price of admission!,"I am embarking on the college search with my second son. Ive already done this once and feel fairly seasoned and maybe just a bit cynical about the proocess. I'm very familiar with college giudes and when I bought this book yesterday, along with a couple of other ""guides"", I wasn't expecting to see anything new. Fortunately, I was wrong. It is so refreshing to read such an organized, thoughtful, honest, and unique perspective! These guys have truly come up with something of value for students and parents. The market is flooded with over opinionated and under researched college guides; this one does not fall into either category. The ""I Wish I Knew When..."" section at the beginning alone is worth the price of the book. I haven't seen that much solid, valuable college advice in one place, ever."
3,One of my favorites,"So while i agree with most of what the other reviewers have been saying, and i do really like the style /fomat etc. of this book, one of the things i was most dissapointed about was the section where they ask the students what a prospective student wouldn't see on a tour or be told. essentially, whats something bad about your school. one or two students were really great about this part, talking about the difficult social scene because of a rural campus etc. but i felt that most of the reviewers put so much spin on their responses they pretty much lost the point of the question."
1,Real Student Opinions? Try Again,"While the authors of this book might claim to be providing the ""real"" opinions of students at various colleges and universities they are in fact making great and often creative use of their ""edit"" function. Many ""statements by students"" are printed entirely out of context and most passages appear to have been selected by the authors because of their humor and sarcasam, not because they offer any real insight. How do I know? My school review was accepted then chopped up to feature exclusively tongue-and-cheek (and simply smart ass) sound bites that represent only a small portion of my opinion of the college. This book does give SOME insight that the admission offices of the US are unlikely to provide but buyers should be aware that the interviews selected were chosen to be more humerous than useful and more ""hip"" than thoughtful."
3,Mixed!,"My biggest problem is that most of the students were from the same state that the school is located it. Therefore, not very helpful for people out of state which we are. There was one section that was helpful--things that the administration probably wouldn't want you to know but overall disappointed."
1,Stay Away From This Book,"I personally think this book is very misleading.First of all, it rates Carnegie Mellon as ""MODERATE,"" by ""Intensity of Nightlife"" but then when you actually flip to the Carnegie Mellon profile, it lists it as ""LAID BACK"" ... which one is it? I go to Carnegie Mellon, and I can tell you, the nightlife here is PATHETIC. Whoever wrote the write-up about Carnegie Mellon probably works at the Admissions Office. There's nothing candid about the reviews of schools in this book."
3,A trio of stories--two out of three are good.,"This book contains three stories about the alternate universe first encountered in the original series and continued in Deep Space Nine. I enjoyed the first of these stories (dealing with characters from Star Trek: Voyager) and the third (dealing with characters from Deep Space Nine). The middle one was about the Romulans and I think all the characters in there were new, at least to me.I was disappointed in that we didn't see a conclusion to the ending of empires towards which Spock was working in the first of the Mirro Universe books."
4,Terran Rebellion,"Barely compatible with the ""Dark Passions"" duo, Obsidian Alliances was nevertheless as well formulated as its Part 1, Glass Empires.It would seem that the Klingon-Cardassian Alliance and the Terran Rebellion are doomed to years of fighting, until one exterminates the other (or unless our heroic universe steps in). Mirror characters of DS9 and VOY are almost all as sharp as the ones we're used to except focussed on way different and desperate goals.Never really connected with NF, but it did add to the completeness of the work.Here's hoping that the violent Alliance also falls (their cooperation is tenuous at best anyway).Not too keen on the larger font print. 3.5 stars."
2,Inferior sequel,I was really looking forward to this book because part 1 was so good but this book was a bore and very disappointing.
5,Mirror Mirror on the wall,"What has been happening in the Mirror Universe? How do the crews of Voyager and Excalibur fit into this world where they never went to the Delta Quadrant, or was raised a slave?"
4,Very grounded,"I orded this CD because of a single entitled ""Let Go""which has a special meaning to me. This partcular songreally gives you a heart felt lift."
4,Great CD,This is a wonderful CD that minister to your soul especially let go and let God. I know we need to do that as children of God to let go of a lot of things that we are experiencing. It will help you stand when you are dealing with different situations of the world.
5,Great Book for Therapy and self help,"This is a fantastic book to have ready to hand out as bibliotherapy when dealing with clients struggling with internalized homophobia. Full of exercises, strongly CBT in style, and a list of Gay Affirmative Churches this is a very useful resource for therapists and clients alike."
2,great when it works,"I have owned 3 Nomad versions and upgraded out of brand loyalty.I am on my 2nd ZenXTRA. The first peformed well and then had serious (as in its internal hardware failed) problems. It was out of warrantee and I purchased another. Very quickly a similar problem occured (now the unit is en route to the USA repair facility).Pros:- great sound- great battery life- fine software- excellent &quot;package&quot;Con- unreliableIf you get one that lasts (a friend has a 6G that is solid as a rock) you have a great value. Otherwise, you are wasting time and money (I had to re-load approx 3000 tracks several times after required &quot;hard resets,&quot; only to get a &quot;firware failed&quot; message)."
1,"Don't Buy!!!! Lousy product, even worse customer support.","Do not buy this piece of junk! Mine just stopped working after I had it for a month. When I sent it in under warranty I was told that the hard drive had failed due to 'physical damage.' The thing is I never did any damage to the device. So after paying $300 to get to use the thing a month, I was told I have to pay another hundred to make it work again."
3,Will Not Desolove Well,"The creamer is excellent as far as flavor goes, but it takes a long time to desolve in any temperture of coffee. I do not know if it is because it is sugar free or not. Other then the fact that I wish they had larger sizes of it, it is just fine to use."
1,Killer Creamer,Wow. This has been my favorite creamer for about three years now. I drink 5-6 cups of coffee a morning and may have a few during the day. A 'serving' of this is about two tablespoons for my coffee. I like it white and sweet!So what I've just learned it that I've basically been injesting a lethal dosage of trans fat every single day.1 gram of transfat for every cup of coffee I drink. I had no idea.WAY TO GO FDA!! Wonder what they got paid to make this minor exclusion.Thanks Nestle for expoiting the system. Should be attempted murder.
4,coffee creamer,"Glad to have access to this hard to find product in local stores. A bit too pricy with S&H, though."
1,bad ingredients,"If you are watching what you eat and don't want to eat trans fats, then you should avoid this product or any other product that has partially hydrogenated oils in them. It's pretty fricking brilliant that the FDA allows a product to be labelled with 0 trans fat per serving when its actually about a half gram per serving. If the FDA really cared about this they would demand that labelling shows EXACTLY what is in the product. If you drink 2 or more cups of coffee a day with this stuff in it, you are getting a nice big dose of trans fat and doing yourself harm. This is not a liver friendly food. Eat liver friendly and you will live a long life. Your liver is the filter for the body. Just like a pool filter, once it gets clogged, it doesn't work good. Fortunately, the liver is one organ that can repair itself if you let it. Remember, eat liver friendly foods."
1,NOT HAPPY,I ordered these dvd's and never received them. I did get a full refund but they should not have been listed if they were out of them. Do not order!!
4,"Well thought out, useful for my needs, excellent diction","I found Sr.Joyce's voice to be most pleasant to the ear. I was looking for material for a day of spiritual enrichment for my Stephen Ministry group. These tapes were so appropriate. Our ministers vary in both age and ""transitional"" phases. I first learned of Sr.Joyce's ""down to earth"" messages from the ""Living Faith"" booklet which I read daily. I can't wait to read Sr's other books."
2,"Too large, not sharp enough","As other reviewers have stated, these nail clippers are simply too large for even medium sized dogs. I have a 25 lb pup whose nails are impossible to cut with these clippers. They are difficult to maneuver when you are cutting anywhere near paw pads. Plus, they made my dog yelp because rather than relying on a sharp blade to cut the nails, they seem to squeeze the nail pretty hard before cutting it off. The file is too small and didn't hold up to even one round of filing. Plus one star for the convenience of the styptic powder in the handle, otherwise, I can't recommend these clippers."
2,Blade dented on first clip!,"Two stars because I think the overall idea of this product is great but the execution is sorely lacking.I picked these up for my medium sized dog because they seemed sized for medium dogs and absurdly large for small dogs (which the reviews here seem to back up). The very first cut I made on my dog's nail (not even a thick one) dented the blade! I was not impressed.Also, while I like the idea of having the file and the styptic powder on the clipper, the file is cheap (like an emery board you would get for your own nails) and did not even hold up for a single foot! It might last through all four feet being done ONCE on a smaller dog.I'm not happy with this purchase and will be returning them if possible."
5,Best Dog Nail Clipper,"I finally found a dog nail clipper that is durable and does a firm cut with a very sharp blade. I feel secure when I use it on my chihuahua, because it doesn't grab on the nail and the cut is over right away. I totally recommend it!"
2,No height adjustment...,"I bought this for my 5 month old son. To my disappointment, his feet did not touch the floor. I looked for height adjustment, but only thing I found was the adjustment belt on the seat pouch and it was not enough. I am happy with the product design and how easy it was to assemble it, but I decided to give it 2 stars since the product description did not warn of the lack of height adjustment feature nor did it have information on approximately how tall the baby has to be in order to use it."
3,No Height Adjustment,"I just bought this for my 5 and a half month old son. We also have the jumperoo which he loves.. but we figured this would be nice as well for venturing around the house.. it is a nice item and easy to put together, has a great deal of accessories.. etc.. BUT.. there is NO HEIGHT ADJUSTMENT, only this tab on the set itself which only would raise your child up.. so for the little ones that are starting to venture, this is a downside.. because it can cause some frustration with the little ones when there feet aren't touching the floor to actually move. Also.. this is nice because it does have a rubbery substance on the bottom to aid in braking, but if you have any rugs, forget about it.. they get stuck in the rug. we will definately keep this item, but I wish I looked at it a little closer."
2,This broke after 1 week of use,"This item broke after i week of use. The pieces would not lock together. Maybe I had a defected one, I don't know but seems like it should not have broke after 1 week. It is also BIG."
2,"great for toddlers, not great for starters","I bought this item thinking that my 5mo old daughter would enjoy this, but she did not touch the floor and there is no height adjustments except for the seat, but it is only if your baby is getting bigger. She hated the fact that she could not touch the ground. I know that she is tall enough to use walkers and activity centers because she is in them all day at daycare. The mini maesro is wonderful and she loved when I would hit them and she would play with them. So I believe that this is a great toy for baby's that are longer or for maybe 7 mo's and up. (my baby is in the 50th % in height.)Just my opinion.Erica"
1,Tiny Steps 2-in-1 Walker With Mini Maestro,"This product I honestly believe should be recalled!!! I have a 6 1/2 month old baby at home and we just bought one and brought it right back to the store... First of all, I must say that it is very colorful and I liked the features on it immensely! My little boy absolutely loved the music, lights and colors etc. However, and here's the big issue: the steering wheel is very close to the key on the top of the walker and my little boy got his wrist caught up in it several times to the degree of me worrying that we were not going to be able to release his arm from the two pieces!!! This is highly worrisome to me! I truly believe that the manufacturer needs to place the key further apart from the steering wheel and I wouldn't be surprised if this product was indeed pulled from the market! I would just like to warn other parents against purchasing this product due to the hazards of getting body parts stuck in the product!!!!!"
3,Cal - a novel for school,"I had to read it for a school assignement and I was not really fond of it. A book dealing with the Northern Ireland conflict? Weren't there already too many concerning this topic? However Cal is very easy to read for an ESL student and therefore I can recommend it. The story is quite interesting, but sometimes I miss the logic. Especially the ending was not too good. To sum it up one can say that this book is nice as an evening lecture and one gets insight into the terror of Northern Ireland, but it does not have a deaper meaning. For those of you, who are interested in NI and what it really means for a young person - go for it!"
5,Unexpectedly haunting.,"This book sat on my bookshelf for 10 years before I finally read it--I'd picked it up in a book sale way back and thought it looked interesting. Don't know why I waited so long to read it, but now that I have, I can't shake it. Its story is deceptively simple, but somehow its images haunt the mind long after reading. I guess it's the timelessness of it themes--violence (unfortunately) and love--because though the book was published in 1983 and the story itself, from hints in the book, I think is set about ten years before that, it obviously still resonates with readers in 1999. I wanted the story to go on, to find out if Cal survived his redemption."
2,Needs a better review for accuracy,"Lots of good explanations - but also many sidebars which don't help. Biggest problem is lots of errors in the math examples which hopefully will be caught if reprinted:pg20 - 94 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 (meant to be 96=2x2x2x2x2x3)pg21 - this time correct prime factorization but still says 94pg100 - products of 4 & 9 roots mixes addition and multiplication... 3 errors in the step-by-step process; complicated by using yet another ""+"" when should be ""X"" in the description afterwards.pg103 - denominator of final answer should be 5, not 15Frustrating I've been marking the book up for errors."
1,No service,I ordered this item as a Christmas gift for my nephew. He received a book labeled to a different child. Attempts to reorder or otherwise correct this error were fruitless. What a disappointment. The company never acknowledged my problem at all.
4,"Five-Star Girls' Basketball Drills, Second Edition",This book was very helpful to me. I was able to find a lot of conditioning drills that I could use with my high school basketball varsity team.
2,Hogwash & Tomfoolery,"i give dem dudes 2 measly stars for da simple fact dat dey beats is ayight, and dey got a nice li'l rhythmic flo wit'em. other den dat, dem boys is immature amateurs, ya heards me people. sounds like dey got alot of anger inside, spittin' lyrical negativity and contributin' to da devil's movement. dey needs some soul elevation, and give dese kiddies somethin' REAL to look up to. maybe dey could take some lyrical lessons from...sayyy...Blackalicious, or Lauryn Hill. learn to bear fruit and to give somethin' REAL to other peoples. trust me, it comes back to you multiplied homey. PROMOTE the PRODUCTION of POSITIVITY!"
4,I liked that he wasn't an overbearing alpha type.,"The hero in this book is really quite something. He's a decent, caring, interesting fellow, a refreshing change from all of the overly alpha heroes in the novels I've been reading lately. The only problem I had with the book was that the heroine's rejection of the hero after they'd already fallen in love sort of fell flat. I didn't think her reaction was realistic."
2,I think I've read this before,I felt like I was reading a book I read before and seems like a noblewoman would recognize another member of the peerage. A nobleman disguises himself as a low-class servant just to meet a girl must really be desperate! Barbara Cartland did this better a hundred times over
3,Unusual word lists,"The words search puzzles in this small book are, according to the author, ""based on the most hilarious stuff on the planet."" The word lists include such offbeat themes as stupid pet names, bad fads, common Internet acronyms, and terms for kissing and vomiting. While these themes are unusual and original, I would not call them hilarious. The edition I own has a whoopee cushion included inside the back cover - to guarantee that the solver approaches the puzzles with a silly mind-set, I suppose.I only rated this book with three stars out of five because the placement of the words in the grid is not well thought-out. Some of the grids have no, or almost no, words on the diagonal (which to me are the hardest to find), and one of the puzzles has the words clustered in only half the letter grid. Still, they do make for entertaining puzzling.Eileen Rieback"
2,Slightly different from the LP version on Vinyl,"Good quality, but I was very dissapointed that this was not exactly recorded as the LP or Cassette or 8 Track. Itty Bitty PolkaDot Bikini shouldnt even be in here!"
2,BUYER BEWARE!,"Alright, I did not buy this album. I listened to the previews though!I was going to buy this as an MP3 album. The version of ""My Baby Loves Lovin'"" by White Plains sounded like the original on here.NOT ALL SONGS ON HERE ARE THE ORIGINALS! ""Game Of Love"" by Wayne Fontana & The Mindbenders was a dead give away re-recording. So is ""Hippy, Hippy Shake"" by the Swingin' Blue Jeans. ""Two Faces Have I"" by Lou Christie sounds like an original, but very bad sound quality.""Wild Thing"" by the Troggs also sounds close to the original.For the original recordings I'd suggest the two disc Gold compilations from Hip-O records ""The Summer Of Love Gold"" or ""The British Invasion Gold"". I have those, and it's great to have various artist compilations with the originals, but not all the songs on this collection are on those."
2,plodding,A police procedural with little of the taut tale that I am used to. The sniper begins to assassinate men who for one reason or another have eluded the death penalty by being acquitted of murders they had very likely committed. The police are baffled and at a loss on how to proceed as the number of victims increases.Good solid writing and plot but a bit weak on character development and excitement. 2.5/5
3,No great shakes,"Well - it's pretty basic - and, at times, seems to give some awkward, overly simplistic direction - though it may be helpful to someone who has never done any counseling at all. It may be that the problem is that the client discussed as an example, ""Sallie"" , is fictitious (so it doesn't ring true at times). I would recommend Lawrence Shulman's text on ""The Skills of Helping"" - it's far better at basics for Clinical Social Workers (although it gives direction for SW across a variety of settings, not just private practice).It does have a good outline of a psychosocial and Substance Abuse Assessment for beginners, though - collects all the most important info."
4,Enjoyable book on a fascinating subject,"I agree with all of the criticisms by previous reviewers -- there are some easily caught errors (which speaks to poor editing as much as anything) and some goofy narrative speculation (not only the reindeer-clad moon-watching Cro-Magnon but also the weary Roman foot soldier). I started the book several times and, confronting these weaknesses, put it down again. But I always wound up going back because the subject is so interesting, and did eventually finish the book.Having acknowledged the faults, though, I must say that I learned a lot reading this book, which is filled with interesting anecdotes as well as respectful nods to the many people who contributed to the development of our present-day calendar. The author does a good job of balancing specific information with the big picture, and one learns quite a bit about the history of Europe and the Catholic Church (and other areas and institutions to a lesser extent).There is a good index."
2,What Time Is It?,"It's a fascinating topic--how do you create a unit of measurement for that most elusive of all illusions: time?But it's not all that fascinating of a book. I'm not a big fan of non-fiction books loaded down with hypothetical meanderings--the purely fictional fairy tale of a ""cro-magnon Francis Bacon"" is simply embarassing to read--and even the recitation of facts is questionably at times.A fine concept, but there's a lot left to be desired on the follow through."
3,Journalese,"Maybe it's just me, but I find the style of this book and others like it (notably Dava Sobel's Longitude) leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth. I would rather not be treated as a tabloid newspaper reader, however clear and informative the content. Two stars for style, then; the third is awarded in view of the fascinating story within these pages."
2,Alternative for those needing details,"'Calendar' lives up to its other reviews. Not a real history and not a real book on computing calendars. An alternative book, readily available at Amazon, may be what some users really wanted.While not a history of calendars, 'Calendrical Calculations: The Millennium Edition' by Edward M. Reingold, Nachum Dershowitz (Paperback) provides brief historys of a dozen or more calendars, and complete information on the mathematical basis of the calendar, and how to do calendric calculations. It's not for the casual or non-mathematical reader, but provides a wealth of information for those who are not afraid of strange symbols. (I have no connection with the publisher, authors, royalties or any such; I'm just one of thousands of delighted readers.)"
2,An Error-ridden History,"I ordered this book expecting it to be an entertaining history of the development of the calendar, but this history tends to be very sterile in its presentation. Personalities are buried under dry facts. My biggest objection is how many errors occur. Not just the numerous typographical errors, but ridiculous ones where the author states the reverse of what he obviously means. Even his step by step procedure for calculating the date for Easter doesn't work because of errors. One has to wonder if anyone read the galley proofs."
3,A good 'Coming of Age' story,"This is the story of Ormond, an orphan who is raised and influenced by several very different men. It is a reflective story, but not a slow-read. You learn how Ormond chooses his values and learns how to judge people based upon his own opinions and beliefs, not what others try to tell him. It is a good novel, worth reading, not necessarily a great ""adventure"" but more a life story about how a young boy grows up and becomes a man---one with morals, when those around him sometimes lack all morality."
5,Make It Through This World,"**********************Track Listings:**********************Track Listings:1. Dream Away the Blues2. This I'd Do3. Green Eyed Girl4. Make It Through This World5. Don't Let It Go to Waste6. Lonely Pair7. I Love It When She Lies8. No Higher Ground9. Sad, Sad Girl10. When I Think of You My Friends11. Close to the Tracks12. Lonesome for You Now"
3,Good but disappointing,"I am a Sarah Brightman fan and saw the PBS presentation of Harem.On the strength of the PBS show I ordered the DVD. The music is great, but I found the video quality poor.I don't know if this is due to ""artistic"" camera and/or editing work or just bad quality.On the plus side, the behind the scenes segments on the DVD were tremendous"
4,HAREM DESERT FANTASY,Fun and very interesting where and how and the hard work it takes for a final production we can sit in our easy chairs and enjoy.
2,Not her best work,"When compared to her other musical works, this CD does not show her true range, or ability. Usually when I buy one of her CDs. I listen to it for days on end. I listened to this CD several times, trying to like it, and found none of the incredible sounds and beauty that normally abound in one of her CD. The songs that were chosen for this CD did nothing for her voice and her voice was not befitting the songs. All in all it was a very disapointing CD which is now gathering dust."
2,"Good visuals, banal music","I saw the TV special and I am ordering the DVD, but it's for the fantastic settings, landscapes, and costuming. Basically art reference. To be frank, Sarah's voice is lovely, but a lot of her musical selections for Harem left me cold. And since she is a singer, not a dancer, her on-screen posturing actually provoked laughter on several occasions. Especially when compared to the background dancers who are VERY good. Still, I am buying it for the pretty pictures."
1,Le pire livre pour commencer son chemin dans la magie !,"Premièrement l'auteur n'est pas un praticien de la magie, mais un journaliste. Ne rien prendre de ses écrits au sérieux. Mme si certains Wiccans n'aiment pas Cunnigham, bien je vous recommande 100 fois plus de lire ses livres a Cunnigham que de lire les livres de Eric Pier Sperendio. Honntement, a vaut meme pas la peine de le lire a lla bibliothèque."
5,yucky job made bearable,"Just the right size for our 60 pound pooch. Made of non-rusting material so can rinse and leave outside. Shovel has a bend in it that makes the scooping easier and more complete. Handle length fine for me (5'3"") and hubby (6'3""). Wouldn't call this small but regular unless talking about cleaning up after farm animals...."
4,Spade Set,"This is a two part set, arrived with one part...refund was promptly issued, and return was easy, however I had to re-buy the item."
1,Deceptive,"Buyer beware of deceptive advertising like this one. Thought the set included all items shown....but only includes a small scoop and a big pan, no rake and no small pan. Will not buy from these people ever again."
4,Good Product,This was just as described. I just thought when you got the large tray you would get a large scrapper. The scrapper we got looks like it is for a med or small tray. Pleased with everything else
4,Does the job!,This product is well constructed for the price. Have had it for a few months and it seems to be holding up nicely.
5,Cheb khaled is the best all over the world...,"I want to thank Cheb Khaled for his wonderful music,,because it adds new manner to all youth who can enjoying this music...I wish if Cheb Khaled can see my rate to know that there is a great young who loves him to the death...also I advise everybody to hear the great music ""Rai"" and he will taste anew favourite..."
3,Good guide,I bought this book at the same time as I purchased Guide to Machine Quilting. It is well done but less informative as the Guide to Machine Quilting which I refer to quite frequently.
5,Had to buy second copy,My mother borrowed this book and still has it. She refers to it regularly. I finally had to buy another copy for myself.The directions are very easy to follow and the pictures are clear.Each chapter is a different technique taught by an expert.Just reading through it gets you excited about trying some of the projects.
5,I love it!!! And the price is great!,"This is my second laptop. The first one was a Toshiba with a 17"" screen, but I discovered that it wasn't very ""portable"". This new laptop is not only half the price of my first one, but works so well. First of all, it is superfast with the Athlon processor and the 1.24 Giba of Ram and it includes the double layer DVD drive for DVDR and DVDRW. Besides, the screen is very clear and I'm really happy with this purchase."
1,dont buy it here,"I purchased this laptop on January 6th 2006 and was told it would ship within one -two business days.......Here we are on the 23rd of January and it still hasn't shipped. BUT, it gets better. Not only have I waited this long for it to ship, but I am being told that I cannot cancel this order either since its ""so far along in the shipping status""............DONT BUY IT"
2,Not the greatest,"I ordered this belly ring and when i got it was surprised. A) because the top flower is much larger than i had expected, (still cute) just very gaudy... i would only wear it for a party or something. B) i was mad because it was a dud!!! it didnt work... it was Broken... it is supposed to be a top mount belly ring... it was shipped in two seperate pieces and the ball screwed onto one end and it seems like the flower should screw onto the other... but it doesnt!!! im trying to return it!! i did like the other belly ring i got from body candy tho!! the one that wasn't broken.... n e one else have a similar experience?"
4,Catchy!,Great dance and road tune! Comments on the songs origin as a tribute are wasted. It's fine on its own!
4,Lovely and useful,"I originally bought this scale in green just for the look. It matched my kitchen perfectly. But, I have also found it to be incredibly useful too. The ""cup"" is generously sized allowing me to measure all sorts of things. I've also found it wonderful to use for baking as measuring by weight is far more accurate. When not is use, it's great as a fruit / veggie holder. The numerical markings are large, plentiful and easy to read. I am so pleased I bought this scale. I encourage you to check out thier full range of colors too!"
2,Pretty = 2 stars,"I needed a kitchen scale - I saw this one, it looked cool, so I bought it.The Typhoon Retro Revolution is really revolutionizing the way measurements are taken! If this scale is correct, weighing objects has gone from being standardized to completely arbitrary. Seeing as how this idea goes against my pragmatic nature, I have come to realize that the laws of physics haven't changed -- the only thing that changes is the result of any measurements taken from this scale.If you put a 12oz soft drink on the scale it may read 12oz. Lift the soft drink from the scale and put it back on the scale and it may read 8oz. or 18oz. There is no way to zero this scale... every time it is zeroed, and then something is weighed, then removed, the scale is no longer zeroed -- as if it is on a mission to unhinge me.I do not recommend this scale to anyone except for model home decorators, art majors, or people who are on an open-ended quest for answers but don't necessarily care what those answers are."
4,Good looking enough I bought another one.,"But the Amazon price for the particular color was too good to pass up. Now I have 16 lb. capacity when weighting ingredients. Two nice stainless bowls to hold them. Not to mention decorative ' bookends '.There are 100% stainless finish models out there for a few dollars more than the Amazon blow-out price, they do look good as well. But paint is an art form, and these scales will get compliments."
1,Not what you think,Any author that writes 117 books on How to Start a Business should find out more information on what he is writing about and not be so general.
3,Realistic and engaging,"This book is written by a Hong Kong foreign correspondent, who really knows the life of the overseas reporter, and renders it faithfully and amusingly. A great book for people interested in journalists, Hong Kong, or just a good read."
4,Adventures with Hal,"Retired from the military and newly licensed as a P.I., Hal Decker's first case involves meteorites, geologists and, of course, women. He travels from his office in San Francisco to Buenos Aires and on to Antarctica, encountering trials and tribulations every step of the way. I read it in one sitting. I recommend this title to all mystery fans."
5,I LOVE IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I LOVE brahms! He is my Favorite composer ever! It is the best CD ever! It has all his hungarian dances! I LOVE IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I really think you should buy this CD!
4,Good chair,"It's just a good chair. Nothing exciting, it does the job. Very easy to put together and take apart if you want to use the base alone - which I did last week when we took the base with us on vacation. The lights are good, but you can't point them in a different direction, say if you are sitting next to the kid and are trying to read. But, they are still pretty nice to have.It doesn't get attached to the car seat, it's the belt that is holding it in place, so yes, it moves around if the child is not in it. In my car (Honda Civic) it works best on either side, but not in the middle: if it's in the middle, then it leans if my son leans over."
5,My kind of music!,"I have to admit that prior to purchasing this album I really had no knowledge of Toots' long history of making music. I always loved the sound of reggae - my dad listened to Hawaiian reggae while I was growing up - and I was ready for something fresh and new.What I enjoy most about ""True Love"" is that Toots' vocals are never drowned out by his guest artists. He has a strong, almost bluesy sort of voice, and he really sounds like he enjoyed making these songs. It really amazes me that he was able to work with so many artists from such varied genres. ""Pressure Drop"" and ""Monkey Man"" easily satisfy my need for upbeat, fun, summer/spring sorts of songs while ""Careless Ethiopians"" and ""Blame on Me"" paint a landscape drenched in a darker, haunting tone. If I were to name a song that I do not care for too much, however, it would be his collaboration with Shaggy, I think mostly because Shaggy's vocals aren't too great on here."
5,Best album this year,"TOOTS is one of my alltime favorites, and this album is great! THe guest appearances arent cheesy and Bonnie Rait and Willie Nelson and the others fit right into the groove. I also bought the Skasmatic and a few of the songs have that same Toots-style groove to them like Honey Nuh Cry. THe two of them make great party background for us who love ""Big people music"""
4,Great intro to Toots,"What a fun album this is! A great intro to Toots and the Maytalls, and lots of contact with old friends who contribute to the collaborations. Willie Nelson has never sounded funkier."
5,Toots is Still Moving to Me!,"Produced in the same vein as recent Santana and BB King albums, this is a throughly enjoyable reggae compilation of hits from Toots and the Maytals---with contributions from some wonderful talent---and some that maybe should not have been included.While the old school players on this album shine; Willie Nelson, Bonnie Raitt, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Bootsy Collins; Ken Boothe, Marcia Griffiths, Bunny Wailer and Keith Richards, some of the younger talent contributing to this album may pale in comparison.Overall this is a highly enjoyable, well produced CD that has scarcely a weak track on it.Keep on movin' Toots!"
3,Let's get it straigh - toots rules but not this redone work,"Okay - I love Toots, he's a legend and he deserves to get respect, recognition and sales. This Cd has big name artists giving respect. But I'm trying to advise on the CD here, and must say that these redone versiobns are pale imitations of the wicked, grooving originals.If you haven't heard the originals PLEASE GET THEM as then you will know what Toots sounds like in his prime. Bloody good. If you have the originals, get this and give toots a big up."
3,Respect to Toots,"Toots Hibbert is a bona-fide music legend. He is ageless and as soulful as they come, with that being said, this disc is not top shelf reggae. The benefits of this disc are many : get Toots to a wider audience and expose the majesty of reggae to those who would never seek out the real, unless some pop (usually white) artists give it the okay. I am not hating on Toots or any of his guests, just a little bitter that Toots is not a household name. Seek out Toots classics from the 60's and 70's for an example of what I'm talking about. This disc is great for beginers or the un-initiated.Jah Live."
2,What?!,"I bought this CD thinking it was a Toots album only to be surprised that it was a sort of tribute album. First of all, I've always hated tribute albums mainly cuz they ALWAYS suck and secondly, with the addition of these ""radio"" artists, it really took away, more than it gave to the greatness of Toots and the Maytals. If you love top 40, you'll love this album."
5,A Must Have!,Not much more I can say beyond the previous reviewers - but this is a must have for any fan of reggae-ska. If you're new to the genre then this is a great intro. While this album may be collaboration with guests - Toots commands the show on every song. Like an earlier reviewer said - this will become your most favorite CD for the summer. Guaranteed.
1,I never received this item - was totally RIPPED OFF!,"I've been waiting for 8 weeks to receive this item, still have not. I would never purchase from this seller again!"
5,Cake pop sticks,These sticks are perfect for use with cake pops. The length of the stick is excellent for this use. I highly recommend this item.
5,rock you punk!,"Intense, personal scream-core, med-fi production values, eerie artwork...from one indie-record-store-junkie to another"
3,not the best book on adult films,I have read alot of books on the subject of adult films and this was not one of the best. Its not that its a bad book its just that anyone with web access can read interviews in the same vein with all the porn stars they want. A good Hustler interviewer asks the same questions (i.e. whats your fave position etc). Its one saving grace is the interviews with directors and behind the scenes personnel. If your looking for a good book on porn check out The Other Hollywood or Skinflicks both are great histories of porn films.
2,Not recommended,"If you really want to understand more about the history of the ark of the covenant, there are several other good books in this field. ""Sacred Quest"" reads more like quasi-fiction, blending some history with a lot of conjecture to create something that's neither entertaining nor informative. I had to push myself to finish this book."
1,Mismatch to the model year,"When I placed the order, I used the tool on the website to make sure that it fits my 92 NISSAN Sentra XE coupe. Sadly, when I took a pain to take the internal door panel and the original mirror off, I found that new one's cylindrical column designed for help to find the right fitting position was offset by almost 5mm away from the original design. I have to clip off that plastic thing to install it. However, when I hook up the cables, the motor didn't work at all, while my original mirror's motor still works except the glass on it was chipped. I think there might be some voltage mismatch for the original design, but I don't have tools to find it out. It is totally waste of my money."
3,Good but not great,"I bought this book because I was looking for short hikes for our family with elementary-aged children in all the titled Utah Nat'l parks. It does do a good job of describing the hikes in very great detail, how to get to the trail head, etc. Each hike is rated according to it's difficulty and child-friendliness and length of time to complete. This is all very good and helpful. However, I discovered after the fact that most of this same information is available on the National Park Service website and the brochure available for free at the visitor center, including some that aren't in the book."
4,Very good as the first introduction of WWW history,"It's biography. But rather biography of the World Wide Web itself than biography of Tim Berners-Lee. Contains description of circumstances how the Web was born and its early history.There are other books about the World Wide Web creation, that are larger and with more details. This book is short, but simple and clear even for people who are not historian or computer expert. Very good as the first introduction of WWW history.There are some small errors in technical parts: author mistook server scripting language for client-side scripting language and example of HTML, the basic part of the Web, was badly printed, so it is completely unreadable."
2,i guess some people need stuff like this...,"This book is okay for some people I suppose. I had to read this for a class, and it's not something I would normally seek out. The author is the editor of the ABA Journal, but isn't a lawyer.To me, this seems like common sense written, printed, bound & sold. I naturally try to live a stress free life, anyway. Instead of buying this book, I would just have soon spent the money on some beers with friends--which I consider a much more effective way of dealing with stress, rather than reading what some guy with a collection of stories from his buddies thinks is the path to mental wellbeing.If you're someone who is not very emotionally-minded (like me), I think you will probably agree with my bottom line assessment of the book: ""meh""."
4,vent shades,"Works great, does what it is supposed to do. installs well, but works better with two people."
4,Good but dont play loud,these are good speakers but turn them up to peak power out put and they become distorded with poor base reflex.
4,Early Den Harrow single !,"Even though this is not his biggest hit, it is still very danceable. Any Euro Disco Fans should be happy with this. Get this. You won't be sorry."
3,Bulky,"This is a nice watch all in all, however it is much wider from than I would have imagined. I works well, and is easy t read. If you are not opposed to a larger watch this is a great item!"
5,diesel dz7034,"Fast delivery, super watch got from usa to denmark in 2 days!! top seller!! thank you!:o)"
1,A complete rip-off!,"This book is large print the way Dick Cheney is a Girl Scout. The clues are maybe 14 point (and spread out over several pages to make them difficult to keep track of) but the puzzles themselves are TINY. I got this book for my 94 year old mom, who has macular degeneration, and I might as well have bought her a rabid dog. FALSE ADVERTISING!! Who knows if the puzzles are any good, since they're presented in such an impossible format."
2,Good but not Great,".The performances here are not without emotion. There's a tight, nervous intensity in the Schubert (though balmy and itchy in comparison to Carl Schuricht's metaphysical pyrotechnics!).The Beethoven, though, is bloated and flat and this is one score which needs a lean, athletic approach and one where I'd thought Toscanini would have excelled. Unfortunately the music never quite gets off the ground."
2,OK,"This was a fine, though uninspired performance. For Toscanini fans it is a must but for the rest of us it isn't really worth having. This was at one point (maybe by Dutton Labs?), teamed up with the Schubert 8th on another CD (almost identical cover),though the audio quality here is somewhat superior."
1,Victorinox Swiss Army Men's Excursion Watch #24498 (Watch),"Ordered this watch for my fiance's birthday and couldn't be more disappointed. Not only did the watch come with ZERO paperwork/manual (not even a packaging slip)but when he went to set the time the dial to adjust it with came right out. We are returning it immediately and will not be giving any future business to ""Watch Grabber""."
5,Great watch,"I've owned the watch for 6 months and love it. It's pretty light, the movement is precise, and I love the way it looks. It's a nice casual/work crossover watch for the money."
5,Saints Mini Helmet,Great Gift for a true Saints Fan. i bought 1 for my dad and 1 for my son and they love it.
1,New Orleans Saints Riddell Mini Helmet,The helmet that I received was scratched on top and had some type of glue on the top of the helmet. Very unsatified with product.
2,Too much fluff,"The songs are fun, but there's just too much going on with instruments and making the songs more 'lyrical' to be sung with music instead of the good old fashioned camp style."
3,So-so document,"I'd like to be able to say that this is a great record, but it's not. It's some live recordings from 1984-85, most of which veer towards anarchic keyboard-based noise. The one particularly impressive track here is the opener, an updated version of ""Fate in a Pleasant Mood"" which was first recorded by the Arkestra back in 1960; here's it's long and leisurely. The rest is a bit chaotic and a bit unfocused, to my ears."
4,Sun Ra Synth In A Short Burst,"The material in this 31-minute live release has an intriguing history; Sun Ra presented the master tape of 1984 live performances to the record label due to not being able to fulfill an obligation to deliver pressings of Saturn Records albums.Clocking in at 12:09, Fate in a Pleasant Mood has a big-band swing, but the remaining 19 minutes is dominated by Sun Ra's fascinating ruminations on the synthesizer.Though this a short burst of material, it shows Sun Ra exploring venues and textures in a soundscape of imagination."
5,"Wonderful, emotional, sexy, funny book!","This is the 2nd in her series about firefighters. I am a very serious romance reader and I tend to stay away from Harlequins because, in my opinion, most of them are not good. But I am glad I listened to my friend and read this book! It is certainly one of my favorites and the equal of any ""mainstream"" romance book I've read. Dylan is irresistble and Beth (who he calls ""Lizzie Borden"") is his perfect match. The characters are well-developed, the story is emotional and sexy, and the entire book is very well-written. I recommend you start with Shay's 1st book in this trilogy, FEEL THE HEAT. Dylan and Beth are in this one as secondary characters. To say they do not see eye to eye is an understatement! It is a joy to watch their turbulent and hostile relationship develop! Do NOT miss this book!"
3,A word of caution,"I bought the book hoping that it would be a comprehensive resource for the certification examination.It has no doubt certain very strong areas (e.g. spine, gliomas, neurological syndromes), but other fundamental subjects in a general textbook of neurological surgery are just briefly covered (e.g. the chapter on intracranial meningiomas has 9 pages)or not covered at all (e.g. craniosynostosis).I believe there are currently much better options in the market if you are looking for a general textbook of neurological surgery."
2,Don't Like the book,"This was a great trail for the next edition.this not a replacment of the Rengachary old textbook of neurosurgeryFor there next edition I hope they will look at few things, like having an index on all volumes and not only volume 4???More organization with chapters, talking only once about a subject then referring to the page number for referenceI have the book ,I stopped reading it the time i got my new youmans ........THE advice to all residents here in north America if you are looking for a textbook then you are better off with Youman's 5th edition hands down"
4,A great starter for any beginner in Katakana,This book is not only very simplistic and fun to read. Which in my eyes makes it a great study guide and refference. This book really allows you to learn and read Katakana from the very first day not in fact from the very first hour. The book is set up so that every chapter gets a little bit harder but not impossible to learn. A worthy addition to anyone really seriously interested in the study of Japanese.
4,An odd amalgam,"An odd amalgam of practical firewood splitting and woodland mythology and mysticism; I'd bet the author misses few if any historical or mythological references to splitting firewood, the mystical attraction of a fire, and lore of the wood lot. The author covers Druidic tree worship, gods, sprites and spirits of the wood from numerous cultures, and includes an extremely broad and interesting index of his sources. Some of the connections and references are rather strained, but the true point of the book is in realizing a reverence for the wood, (or The Wood.) In olden times men belived that a tree should be greeted with respect, thanked humbly for its sacrifice, and told to what use it would be put before it was cut down. If that makes sense to you, you'll like this book. If you are looking for a lesson on splitting firewood, here it is: bend your knees."
5,"Appropriately titled - ""Enchanted landscape""","Not too many words in this book. Words aren't necessary because Wynn Bullock's photographic artistry speaks for itself. He is undoubtedly a master of his craft but he is also quite spiritual. When I first saw his image of ""Nude in a Dead Forest"", I paused to look at it. To me, that says something because in this day and age, we seem to be bombarded with so much information and 'eye candy.' Bullock has the ability to transcend the ordinary. I believe he is that good. As good as Edward Weston (a single portrait by his friend Wynn Bullock included in this volume), Imogen Cunningham, and Alfred Stieglitz. There are some quotes from Bullock and they certainly add form to his vision but buy this for the enchanting images of landscapes, nudes, and portraits."
5,Comprehensive beyond compare,"I bought this book for my boyfriend who's a film and Renaissance fair costumer and a heraldry nut.Now, every time I see him he's telling me that he's learned something new from this one book that he's never gleaned from any of the several dozens of heraldry books already sitting on his shelf. I couldn't have been happier with the response.I will warn you though this is an advanced book, not a book for beginners. It's very much presented like a college textbook on heraldry. Learn the basics before delving into this one, but if you're interested in heraldry and think you know a lot, get this book, you'll soon be learning things you never knew, and best of all it has both a definition of the elements of heraldry and a large cross section of true family heraldry.The only downside is as this is a reprinting all the original color plates are in black and white and a bit faded, but this in no way detrimental to the enjoyment of the book. Happy heralding!"
3,"Here We Are, A Telephone Call",It was a bit awkward to read in bed with the pages folding out like a newspaper. A friend had talked about A Telephone Call so I ordered this format rather than a book because other reviews said that her stories could be a bit repetitive and I tend to agree. In both Here We Are and A Telephone Call I found myself thinking that she's saying the same thing over and over again but slightly differently. Luckily they're short stories! Nonetheless both struck a chord with me. Dorothy Parker unpicks the stitches which hold our hearts together and lays bare human emotion.
4,The Image: A Guide to Pseudo-Events in America,"While this book was originally written in 1961, its message is even more relevant today. Reality television, political campaigns, stars and celebrities, pundits and the internet have either developed after this book first came out, or have morphed even more into pseudo-event or pseudo-reality, fulfilling Boorstin's predictions. Well worth reading!"
3,Bought it for class,I plan on reading as little as possible and then reselling it on Amazon for twice the amount I would get from the bookstore at school.

2,NOT WHATS PICTURED,NOT WHATS PICTURED SHOULD STATE THE COME BLACK NEED COATING OR PAINT TO WORK AND LOOK GOOD FOR A LONG TIME.
4,Blast from the past.,It is a joy to take trip down memory lane and see how we kind of were as kids. All I can say is that it does not turn out how u think it will. Especially looking back 22 years later.
5,"A book, a friend, a guide","Whether a newcomer to meditation, or more specifically to guru yoga in the Tibetan Nyingma tradition - or a somewhat more experienced practitioner, this book is extraordinary. If you are new to this kind of mediation, I would say it is one of the best guides into it (as a follow-up to your master's introduction and empowerment, of course). If you have practised guru yoga for a while, you have in your hands a treasury of inspiration. You will be able to dig into it again and again, and still go deeper. If a book can transmit the wisdom-mind of a buddhist master, this is it! H.H. Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche is right there with you."
5,Excellent Performance,"I bought this memory module to use it in my old DELL Optiplex 170L, and is working perfect. I deleted the virtual memory in order to decrease the HDD usage, and the results are simply excellent. If you need a DDR-400 memory module... buy this one!!"
5,Good deal on memory,"I purchased this memory module set to replace failed memory in my Dell Dimension desktop computer. The price was significantly cheaper than I found in any of the retail stores I checked (Office Max, Staples). It arrived in the mail two days after placing the order, was simple to install, and works as promised. It's only been installed for about a month, so I have no opinion on its longevity."
1,Flaky and Unreliable,"This DDR memory is specified to work up to 400MHz and it doesn't even work at 333MHz (room temperature, much less with the cabinet closed). Avoid this product. Order from Crucial instead. It might be more expensive, but at least it might work.Note: I'm an Electrical Engineer with a Masters Degree. I know how to install DDR RAM modules properly."
1,junk,"purchased 2 of these,one went bad and ended up costing 200.00 dollars for repairs,use with extreme caution !"
5,"Perfect fit, fast shipping, issue resolution","Fantastic price here... The tracking showed it was delivered, but no sign on it. The Amazon rep checked tracking and sent out a replacement next day. When the memory arrived, it fit my PC perfectly, was well packed and in perfect condition. Thanks Amazon!"
5,Used it to boost performance of older machine,I used this RAM to upgrade my old Gateway 710x and I have noticed a gradual increase in performance. I needed more RAM since I have been using this old machine as a server somewhat and needed an upgrade.It did what it was supposed to do. Great product!
4,pny ddr3200,"Works well, no conflicts with the existing pny ddr3200 memory. Easy to install, sturdy, durable, and apparently completely compatible with the two gigabytes already on my motherboard."
1,Defective Part,"I was hoping you could help me get a refund. The item didn't look like the picture, it took forever to get here, it had a hand written receipt. When I thought I had an agreement with seller, Straightedgerazor, he never followed through. Now I need to process a refund."
5,Memory Review,The memory arrived timely and installed very easy. It has greatly improved the performance of my computer.
3,Kudos to the Amazon Customer Service staff,"I ordered and received the RAM promptly. It was installed and recognized by the PC just fine but it failed in a few minutes following start-up. I contacted Amazon Customer Service via the feedback on the website. I received a personalized reply quickly following the submission of my feedback. The replacement product was shipped and received in about 2 business days. The website had provisions to print a return shipping label with USPS bar-coded address and no postage required to ship the defective product back to Amazon. The replacement RAM is installed and has been working now for about 20 hours. I believe it will be okay because electronic devices usually fail very quickly or not at all. I would buy the PNY brand RAM again because of the price, so long as Amazon is the seller. This was a very good experience in the handling of a defective new product by Amazon Customer Service. KUDOS the the Customer Service Staff!A satisfied customer,Doug"
5,Exactly what you'd hope for,"We couldn't afford to update my mom's whole computer, but then, she only uses it for pretty basic activities. Nonetheless, that was pretty taxing on her 512mb of RAM, so we were able to get this instead. It popped right into place in her old Dell, and was recognized immediately. The whole machine runs so much smoother now, and she no longer has to turn off important background processes like antivirus programs just to run her computer."
4,PNY Optima 512MB Memory Module,This product was easy to install on the computer. It enhanced the speed by 50%.
2,Doesn't live up to its speed,I purchased this RAM to help improve the speed of my desktop. I was only able to run at 333Mhz FSB. When I moved to 400Mhz the system froze at various points. I replaced it with a different vendor and was able to run at 400Mhz. Dissappointed!
3,Quality,These would not work in the gateway they were intended for. No combination of placement would read these as identical speeds. They did work on my intel motherboard system however so I'm not sure where the root cause lies. Not sure I would try these again.
5,Quick and easy,"Delivery was fast. I had 2 512MB on my old old Dell Dimension 4600 and two empty slots. Powered it off, inserted the 2 new 1GB chips and powered the PC ON. That's it, installation done. Checked the RAM capacity and now see 3GB instead of 1, put a smile on my face. Biggest difference I see is in the startup time, I have Windows 7. Startup of applications is faster as well."
4,Good price for decent ram!,I bought this to replace ram in my Aunt's older computer. she had two 512 chips and I installed these and she said she definitely saw a boost in speed and was incredibly happy.A good product for older machines and for the price you really can't beat it.
5,PC works much better,"Shipping was timely and packed well, RAM was physically without blemish, and my PC's performance is greatly improved. My XP OS only recognizes 1.87 Gig, though. I don't know why. It recognized the full complement installed before this upgrade."
3,Almost,"No matter what combination I install the memory, I can only get my BIOS to recognize 3GB instead of 4GB."
5,Nice product at nice price,"I installed the memory into my computer without issues. The BIOS recognized it as dual channel and PC now has 2096MB of memory. My hard disk is happy that it doesn't need to cache as much. Memory-intensive software now pops right up without a long wait. If you have never installed memory before, I suggest that you read your PC manual or check your PC manufacturer's website for details you need to know beforehand. Speaking from experience, if you don't follow the instructions, you risk damaging your computer."
4,"finally, some RAM",had a hard time finding ram that would work for my dell dimension 3000 but these are the ticket. nice upgrade from the two 256 sticks that it came with
2,RAM UPGRADE,"So far the memory has not worked in the CPU, The PC3200 3ea 1gb replaces PC 2700 2ea 512mb. The change in memory is supposed to work but I need to do further research because I don't believe I completed necessary software changes. It's been some time since I changed any RAM and when you're 75 yrs of age, you forget somethings. It would have been handy if some instructions had been included but none were so I'll have to do some research. The Memory may be physically okay but it's to soon to tell if a higher rating is warranted."
2,Didn't work well.,"I needed to upgrade my ram. I found these online at a good price. After putting them in, my computer ran slower and the picture froze and stuttered. I called the tech support line and they didn't have a fix. I put my old memory back in, and the computer worked fine. I have since bought more ram from somewhere else and it works fine."
5,Memory works good,The memory works as expected and was a good purchase. I was pleased with the upgrade and my computer runs much better
4,DDR RAM for a DELL Dimension 3000,"I ordered the PNY memory from AMazon, which I received and installed with no hitches or problems. My computer is now 4X faster then before for shipping & handling of $64. Total.PNY OPTIMA 2GB (2x1GB) Dual Channel Kit DDR 400 MHz PC3200 Desktop DIMM Memory Modules MD2048KD1-400"
4,Optima 2GB PC3200 RAM,"The RAM works fine -- once it has become comfortable in its new home. Before that, I experienced several crashes and freezes. After each incident, I had to remove and reseat the RAM, pushing very hard to seat it in its sockets. Eventually, all worked well."
4,GREAT price!,GREAT price! Big box store in my area wanted double! Outrageous! You get exactly what is promised; haven't had any issue.
4,PNY OPTIMA 2GB (2x1GB) Dual Channel Kit DDR 400 MHz PC3200 Desktop DIMM Memory Modules MD2048KD1-400,Received on time.No problems with memory. Installed in Intel MBD. Running Windows XP. Went from 1 Gig to 3 Gig. Installed as set. As with all memory u have to insert firmly to get memory installed. You may have to remove and insert again to get them seated properly. Unfortunately Windows XP does not use memory very efficiently. I probably would have been fine with a total of 2 Gig. But memory is running fine with no errors.
4,Satisfied Customer.,Installed this memory in a Compaq Presario that was about 4 years old. Had no problems with the product after install and the product arrived within the specified shipping timeframe. Had to go to vendor's website prior to purchasing to verify the number of pins - it would have been helpful if they had that information in the description on Amazon's site.
2,Disappointment,"After I received the memory chips I installed them in my computer so I could play better my video game. I actually had 4 256 MB chips in four banks in a Dell Dimension 8300 for a total of 1,024 MB and my idea was to bring it up to 2 GB but after a few minutes playing the game it started to freeze. Doing regular computer stuff didn't affect the computer but seems that when it is used intensively the memory start to acting up. I removed the new chips and put back the old ones and I didn't have any problem since.I don't recommend this memory modules for this reason."
4,Pretty Tough To Go Wrong,"About the only thing that can go wrong with a memory purchase is that it's the wrong stuff or it's bad and none of this happened so I'm a happy camper. It was all pretty straight forward. The price was fair the delivery was as expected and it installed, ran and did what it was supposed to do. I generally only dish out five stars when an order exceeds expectations (like arrived early) and none of that happened here but I'm fully happy. Buying memory with good information, so you can order the right stuff, is a lot like buying a pair of socks. Easy. And this order and it's outcome was as easy as it gets."
5,1 GB PNY Memory Module,I had a computer tune up done on my computer and the person that did it recomended this ram stick.PNY OPTIMA 1GB DDR 400 MHz PC3200 Desktop DIMM Memory Module MD1024SD1-400I ordered it and the delivery was quick{about 4-5 days}I installed it in about 20 minutes. My computer speed is much faster than it was with the old 256 ram.
5,Good ram.,Nothing much to say about ram except that installed without a hitch and has been working great ever since. A good upgrade to any computer that needs it.
5,Works as advertised,"I didn't have any trouble dropping this memory into a Dimension 3000. Memory has been performing flawlessly for the first few days. While I don't factor in the performance of a store in product reviews, props to Amazon nonetheless for getting this item to a Prime customer faster than promised before a holiday weekend.Unless something goes south with the memory in the near term, I would buy it again."
5,Works fine!,"Installed the DDR in my computer. Put the computer back together, worked fine. Increased the speed noticably, no glitches, no problems. I'm happy with it."
4,Memory Chips.,Chips showed up quickly and worked as expected. Noticed quicker websurfing and reduced CPU usage. XP is working much faster now.
5,Excellent value,"Belive it or not, this product is assembled in USA, and is cheaper that Kingston memories assembled in China!Quick instalation and no compatability issues with my PC. If you're looking for an economic upgrade for your computer, this is the one. Highly recommended."
1,"AWFUL service, 1 in 4 defective. AVOID PNY!!!",DO NOT BUY PNY MEMORY. They do NOT stand behind their product. They will make you jump through hoops to return their defective products (25% of mine were BAD). They will not do anything to help you. They will charge you thirty dollars if you need a cross-shipped replacement. It's cheaper to just buy new memory. AVOID PNY!
4,Better performance,This memory module was easy to assemble. The system booted up right away and recognized the additional memory. System has been running 5x times faster.Strong recommendation.
5,Perfect!,Needed more Ram. Got it with these. These were cheaper and just as fast as anyone else's. Perfect for what I needed. Sped up the computer quite a bit. My old Dell computer and Windows 7 had no issues with these.
4,New Memory,"I have an old Compaq computer which needed a serious updating of its memory. I have a geek friend who helped me & advised me on what to purchase. This product met all the requirements at a really good price. We installed it and the computer is now running smoothly which has helped me postpone a new computer purchase, while meeting my home computer needs."
5,Great Product!!!,Works fantastic in our office computer. Added much needed speed and stability to our aging system. Would highly recommend to anyone looking to upgrade an older computer. As always Amazon shipping rocks!
5,memory module,I purchased this item from Amazon because they are fast and efficient and most important...great prices!!
5,worked well,"I did some research before buying these to make sure they would work with my computer so I had no problems and I have no computer tinkering experience at all. I just popped to panel off and found the slots to stick these things in and installed them, turned to computer back on and it worked. It sped my computer up a good deal now I can do multiple things without it taking forever."
3,IT WORKS,"I CHECKED THE REQUIREMENTS I NEEDED, ORDERED THE SAME, RECIEVED IN A TIMELY MANNER, THEY WORK AS THEY SHOULD AND HAVE WORKED FOR OVER A YEAR."
5,Great memory at a good price.,"What more can be said, as PNY is a trusted memory supplier to OEMs and also in the upgrade market. These modules fit perfectly, run at their advertised speeds, and will work well in your PC build or upgrade. In the 12 or so years I've used PNY memory modules in my upgrades, I have never had a failure. Not ONE! Buy it, you'll not be disappointed!"
5,pny memory module,product was exactly as describe and was exactly what i needed. it was easy to install with minimal expertise on my part. it does the work it was suppose to and speeded up my computer tremendously
4,Speeds up computer,The computer this ram was for only had 512 mb before this gig. The speed has definitely increased since the processor is decent. Good buy with quick delivery.
1,I would have bought at Newegg,"I can understand 5-10 days for shipping. I don't get 5-7 days to even pick it off a shelf and get it to UPS. Same day I bought something from Newegg, same 5-10 day shipping and I had it two days later. Forget Amazon!"
4,Works with Mac G5,The ram works fine with Mac G5. It is very reliable.But the rebate purchase date is over. Amazon should stop advertising this.
4,A little troublesome to install.. at least for me.,"It's one GB of RAM, obviously. I desperately needed an upgrade to my computer, so I got this. I had to do a little fiddling with what slot I put the RAM in, so it took about three times as long as it should have. But now it's in, and now it's working."
5,great speed boost to aging machine!,easy install - memory immediately recognized by the o/s - just what the doctor ordered
4,Memory upgrade for older PC,"Purchased this memory to refurbish an older desktop so it could be used for surfing the web, doing email, etc. Only had the system up & running for a couple of months, but so far... so good.System is nice and stable using WIN XP PRO SP3.Replaced the hard drive at the same time with Western Digital 160 GB Caviar Blue 100 Mb/s 7200 RPM 8 MB Cache Bulk/OEM Desktop Hard Drive - WD1600AAJB. 160 GB drive and 2 GB RAM works nicely with the single core Pentium 4 processor and the OS.Not the fastest thing on the block, but it's fine for the intended purpose."
5,ram,This ram worked great. No issues at all. Pny always has a good product. I would def buy again. Job well done.
5,"Great, even for an old mac.","This is the best and most affordable way to upgrade any computer. The Mac G5 tower has (like ALL computers) very specific requirements, and then there's the matching too. Works great and makes a noticeable change. It's an older system so any little bit when video/audio editing is welcome. Just remember to really push them in, I was a little too kid gloves and thought I ordered the wrong ones, after reinstalling with a good shove they work great. Now, to get more."
1,i got it,i got my ram but it was not PNY OPTIMA it was a no name brand but works fine and i got it real fast too shipping was a 10 thanks
4,More memory had a huge impact on performance,"I was surprised how my memory needs have grown over time, a huge improvement in performance with the added memory. The PNY memory arrived on the day promised and worked perfectly right out of the package - a very good transaction. I just wish that the price was a little lower."
5,excellent,"it's 2 gigs of ram. and it works. pny is well known, it's the same ram you buy off the shelf at best buy for $10-$15 more."
5,PERFECT!!,"This transformer works perfectly. I use it several times a week with my small items (iron, hair dryer, etc) purchase in England and it has never failed!!"
1,get what ya payt for,"I have awsome taste in autio equipment with a degree in electronics and for the money under 900$ you'll find my first choice rotel spisifcly rx1050 if you cant aford it. yamaha also carys a nice line stay away from sony,dennon and realisic there not worth XXXX! harmon cardon is nice but there over priced for what you get quality is good but output power is nominal you'll get good value for your dollar if you stick with onkio, rotel or yamaha."
3,another hammered mastering job,"These albums have been favorites of mine ever since I owned the original vinyl. But the CD is a disappointment -- yet another product mastered for loudness for no reason whatsoever. Moreover, the sound is inconsistent from track to track; the mastering smacks of crank-'em-out-while-watching-the-clock laziness.I can always tell when a CD has had the life squeezed out it by over-limiting because as I listen to it, I start turning the volume down more and more until it is either at a background level or until I turn it off. In broadcasting, radio program directors have understood for decades that over-processing fatigues listeners and eventually causes them to tune out. Evidently, despite the precipitous decline in CD sales, record companies haven't learned this yet.The labels are not going to stop this nonsense until people start complaining and tell the labels why they've stopped buying."
2,Binding is weak,"Tried this brand. Not sure what brand I got, as it was packaged in a plain white box. No label or instructions. The binding did not hold. I wasted over half the box. Gave up and purchased same size Fellowes brand from another supplier. Worked great. In comparing the two products, the glue strip on this product is thiner than the Fellowes Brand."
2,One Big Yawn!,"A mysterious death in an English country manor with a variety of eccentric relatives, long-time family retainers and an altered will. Sounds like it could be fun? Think again. This is one long snoozer of a book where NOTHING HAPPENS. Through a tenuous girlhood connection, our two extremely annoying protaganists find themselves dropped in the middle of an English country house murder mystery and we are given no reason to CARE about the lot of them. And then there are the very strange transatlantic phone calls home -- the calls would stop the action in its tracks if there was actually anything going on. The biggest mystery? Why did I waste my time with this book."
3,Confusing but entertaining,"I thought Carmen would sing on all tracks. I even asked the clerk at Jazz Record Mart in Chicago if she did. Well, she doesn't! Only on tracks 1,4,5,6,& 9. BUT, that's still 50%, & 50% of Carmen is more than 100% of most singers. She certainly knew how to use style over voice better than anyone! I'm sorry, but, if you read my reviews, you know that I always compare artists & only listen to the best in my estimation. This time I won't say whom she outshines in the ""non-singer"" department but no one else comes to my mind. Only she could go off key & make it appear so artistic. She used her ""dramatics"" to sell every mood. She could even sing on key! The musicians who are unfamiliar to me do a great job & their non-Carmen numbers are wow! Yet, if you want the greatest jazz dramatist of all time on all tracks; then, this isn't it."
4,A Compilation,"I too remember the first time I heard Watercourse Way. I was a teenager working in a record store and my boss through it on the turntable. I was already into the progressive rock sound and this just seemed an extension of that. I've been delighted with their music ever since. What I also remember is that that vinyl release was not on Windham Hill, but ABC/Passport. Now, what happened when the band went with WH I don't really know, but I do know that this release contains songs from that album. Also from Watercourse Way, the song Petite Aubade appears on A Winter's Solstice. Not that it makes any difference, but I think it is interesting to note that this is a collection made up in part of previously recorded material versus a traditionally concieved project. What's cool about it is that it serves as a primer to their music. So if you've never heard Shadowfax and are wondering where to start this is a great place."
4,A long time ago...,"Shadowfax were the pioneers of New Age music. In 1983 they released this album which I come to think it was one of the first compact discs to be issued.It's more than 20 years they did this marvellous album. An album which is the peak of this group and was reference to many artists who liked to explore in new ways of making music.Shadowfax was the first new age group, as soloists were mostly common like Ackermann, Winston, and all the people at Windham Hill (oh, what would have been music without this label?). They were even more remembered a few years after the releasing of their first recordings as their style was becoming too eclectic.Nowadays, it is very pleasant to listen to Shadowdance, but it has been losing some charm. It sounds a little bit old, but it has freshness. It sounds a little bit nave, but it has strength. It's a recording to take in mind and to discover. But you can feel somewhat disappointed if you don't put it into the time it was made."
3,Some great insights. Too much POV.,"The first chapters are full of interesting and insightful history and analysis. After that, it devolves into a series of essays on what Mr. Hutton sees as the ""right"" things for China."
2,Mediocre,"This is two books with little connection between them. The first half is a rather ordinary history of China. The second seems to be a bunch of mediocre newspaper editorials about the U.S.You are likely to enjoy it only if you want to reinforce your belief in the wisdom of the mainstream media.He predicted a financial crisis with a collapse in real estate prices, but thought they would be caused by a falling dollar triggering hedge fund failures (the dollar rose for most of 2008, and rose strongly when the stock market was falling the most)."
5,Shattered....Worth the extra money?,"I love Adema, I was turned onto there music way back before the cd was released, by the world famous KROQ, after hearing ""Giving In"" I had to drive out of my way to get the advance copy of the cd. Then I got the original release the day it came out, then heard of the import one...I must say if you like Adema, and are a fan of theres, definetly buy this cd...Its worth the extra money for the song ""Shattered"". Its there new closing song on there tour with Linkin Park. But no doubt, 5 stars on the cd..and if you have the U.S Release, and like Adema, spend some cash on this cd, and youll be impressed by the song ""Shattered"""
5,BEST ALBUM EVER!,"This Is An Album You Put In Your Stereo And Listen and Listen. It's The Best Album My Fave Songs Are ""Speculum"" & ""Pain Inside"".This Is A Great Album. You First Hear Adema And Say They [stink] Well That Was Same With Me Put After Awhile I Loved It So Buy It Or You [stink].ADEMA RULES!"
1,"GREAT COVER, WEAK CD","THIS COVER IS CREATIVE AND I LIKE IT<<<<but that is all it has going for it. the whole cd is a waste of money. if u want to listen to a real good cd, go pick up the lead singer of ademas brother johathan davis' cd.aka.KoRn."
3,An informative book that lacks direction,"I found the book informative but a bit meandering. Other than describing the sensations of working at a mass grave there was not real informative science or political explaination on what she was doing. I would also liked to have seen more back ground regarding the Serb, Croat and Bosnian conflict. It is explained that Serbs are responsible for mass murder in the last few years but was less forthcoming about the Croation facists that worked with the Nazis to exterminate the Serbs, Jews and Gypsies. Although alluded to, it is not clear. I also thought the flashbacks were poorly integrated and did little add to the story line."
1,worthless...,This is a worthless product. Don't waste money or time. Don't buy. Came broken. Instructions weren't clear or good.
3,Song List,"Hi, much as I would like to rate the album, could you please list the song titles, coz some of the funs buy according to the songs that one is looking for. I beleieve that this is an error but you have repeatedly done so in most of the albums even by other artists as well!Regards, George Kamau"
5,doin' it well,"i play the drums when i was in high school for the football games back in '82 & '83 and this album used to help me warm up and get in the mood to play. the most energetic song was ""call me"" which had a nice drum lick towards the end which i just love."
3,Awsome Cd!!!,this cd is awsome!!! i love the song kitty kat from Daveyboy. This guy is the best i have ever heard. Everyone should really get this album...it's worth it.
2,Wrong Set for my vehicle,The set that was sent to me was for a four door S-10 not an extended cab S-10 as I ordered and is shown in the picture of the item.
2,Good interface using the Palm but poor maps,"This is subject to update!I purchased this device in June'06. Found out that the maps were atleast 4 years old. Called Tomtom they promised that a free update will be coming in end of Summer. Called again in Nov, said I have to pay for the update which will be coming in Dec. I feel this is really unfair as I had paid the full price in June'06 which also included the maps from tom tom.I am going to try again in dec when the updates are available to see whether they will give me a free update."
2,"Quirks, Glitches, & Joy","I can agree with all the reviews listed about this product. It's very glitchy and it's also great when it works. Maybe I have a lemon, but it's completely unpredictable as to whether it will work or not. Sometimes, just plug in and go! Other times... nothing. I'm not patient enough to deal with the unpredictability so mine's going back. IF you're a Palm T5 owner and want an extra gadget for fun... this one's for you. If you NEED (or want) a GPS system that works every time, consider one of the higher quality self contained systems."
4,Decent GPS For Value,"It's a good gps accessory for the price, though you have to plug the palm TX in first then once you power it up unplug the gps unit and plug it back in to get it to connect. Other than that, it is well worth the money."
2,Buyer Beware!,"This product works amazingly well on my Palm E2! However, Navagator 5.0, which is what comes with the product, is already out of date. The maps are old. And in trying to update the maps, I find that the Palm E2 is no longer supported. It seems the software requires a more powerful device with Navagator 6.0. GREAT! Just great.Larry Coffman"
3,Not what I was looking for,I am going to send this back. I bought the car used and it did not come with remote entry. I don't know if it originally did but I thought it was worth a try. They should probably explain on the site that there are other items you need to make this work if not. I just assumed like with many cars they come with them and if you don't order it when you buy the car new it is still there but you don't get the fob. I could have done my research better but I assumed too much I suppose if that is what you need and all you need there is no issue with it.
4,this is arguably a great book,"i cant believe i am the first - were i not i may not have bothered - but this is arguably a great book so i must, and am told, regarded as a classic my yachties in the medthis man is scorned by historians (does dorky things like quote encyclopaedias?) & his style can be amateurish, but hey - rarely dullgreat choice of subject - a/ the med is the hub of most history & b/ the bridge between east & west so he can wander off in either direction - whatever is interesting - his passion tho is naval technology - which is fine as it was the determiner of power.so - read all about it - the suez canal of 500bc, the phoenicians rounding the cape of good hope in 500bc, the greatest scammer of all time - the doge of venice at 80 (he went along) conned the crusaders into sacking a fellow christian city - the greatest prize ever - constantinople - for a few crumbs - and got a nice bribe from the mayor of alexandria as well for diverting them from this original target"
3,Tremendous value,"for RPG addicts, and nostalgic gamers. Big problem:if you dont have Windows 95 or 98, you will not be able to play the first two epics. So beware."
5,Aksyonov,"Great book! Aksyonov continues the story from ""Generations of Winter"" in his own unique style. Any fan of Russian authors should give this book a read. Received the product on time and in good condition."
2,I guess you had to be there...,"Not much of this book sticks in the mind, atypically for an Aksyonov novel. The titanically horrific events of the preceding volume, _Generations of Winter_, practically carried the story along without help. The comparatively (but only comparatively) milder post-war times in the Soviet Union don't leave much for historical fiction to hinge on. So Aksyonov chooses to emphasize the degradation that the long years of war, terror, and compulsory adulation of Stalin and the Party inflicted on the Soviet people. He doesn't pull it off; it's the story and the reader that get degraded. Stick with the first volume of this tale."
1,hard shell case,THis product was HORRIBLE. It didn't even last two days before it started cracking and breaking. It was an absolute waste of my time and money. I DO NOT recommend it!
4,"Great Info, a Bit ""Severe""","A great set of four disks covering Little League baseball to the max. Only caution is that the pro players ""coaching"" these kids (& likely their parents) are rather hyper, I mean, this is supposed to be fun...please keep it that way. Kids matter more than anything else."
1,Another junk of a desktop,"I bought the HP a1210n Pavilion last November 2005. I had researched the web, read great reviews at Circuit City's site, and figured I couldn't go wrong. WRONG! Here it is 9 months later and the thing won't boot up, and the recovery disks are useless. I only get to a blue screen called HP Invent. It goes no further. I wish HP WOULD Invent a good desktop. Buyer beware. Just another junk of a desktop."
2,Poor customer service!,"Computer is inadequate,and customer service is extremely poor!!! After spending hours (at least 3)and multiple calls,taking my computer apart with tech assistance over the phone, requesting a postage paid box to send computer back to be repaired, my issues have NOT been resolved. Warranty is still in place, and 2 nights ago, I was on hold for 2 hours in order speak to a supervisor and then they disconnected me. I won't buy an HP again..."
5,cool,i really like this toy...alot!yasmin's prettier then when i see her most of the time! the only problem about this toys is the perfume and the spray bottle...it's hard to get the perfume in the bottle! i was disappointed at this but i loved playing with the doll...she's just so much fun!
5,She is awsome!,"Ok. I think this doll does look SOOO much better than the others. This doll is so pretty, I KNOW I will by it!"
5,I love it all.,"I give five stars to the whole nighty night collection. I have Yasmin, Fianna, and Sasha. And for those of you that think Fianna is ugly (or any of them) You can't possibly be a true bratz fan."
2,ewww,okay i usally like yasmins but this one is too nice but her clothes have to go they are sooo ugly get jade sasha or cloe but not fianna she looks dead
2,Beware of the toxic perfume this doll comes with,"Someone gave this doll to our daughter for her fifth birthday, making this her fourth Bratz doll. My daughter is extremely mature for her age, thus plays with her toys accordingly. In the midst of her new presents that she was so enjoying, the perfume included with this doll spilled on our brand new cocktail table, and ruined the finish. It ""ate"" the finish down to the wood, in just a few minutes...we're talking about a $1,200 cocktail table that is only two months old.Now, I ask you, if this perfume can ruin this cocktail table like this, how safe is it for our children? We are now dealing with MGA Entertainment on this issue. I just thought parents could use a fair warning, as there are no warnings on the box.Other than that, she does love the doll."
4,Swiss Personal Lubricant,Product works really well. Very smooothing and relaxing. Stays wet and easy clean up. The best lubricant that you buy for your money.
5,Silicone Lubricant,We like this silicone lubricant. It doesn't get sticky and messy and lubricates quite well. I would highly recommend it.
1,Silicone?? It is close to water base.,"It gets warmer, I guess.It is based on water or oil, rather than silicone.I've never used it, it goes to garbage. I don't know where I can use that."
3,Okay,"Navy Science is okay. It's a too messy for me and hard to wash off. I thought it would be nice considering Gun Oil worked so well but it hasn't. I don't think it's worth the price. It's about the same as Astro Glide.MD Science Labs Swiss Navy Silicone Personal Lubricant, 8 Ounces"
2,Runny product,"okay so you want 19 words to reply to the product that was sold to me, alright here they are"
5,Best bang for the buck!!,Great lube. Stays slick a lot longer than any I've tried (and trust me I've tried many!)One caveat: don't use it with silicon toys. Otherwise it'll degrade them.
5,I Know This Is a Personal Lubricant...,"I know this is a personal lubricant but it is the BEST lip gloss I have ever used! Just the right amount of shine and not sticky, great product!"
1,blah,"I picked this book up to read for a paper in my contemporary literature class. It worked out well for the paper, but the book itself sucks. There really is no plot. The entire book consists of going to ""Tragic"" (night club), getting high, and having sex. Towards the end of the book Shaw (I think) tries to put an element of mystery into the story with the whole black cab thing but... too little too late??? I dunno...If you want some sort of gay romance novel and just want something the get you excited, this is the book. If you are looking to be entertained with a good story line... look elsewhere!!!!!!!"
1,Wondering why Amazon sells this,Why is Amazon selling this product if there are so many complaints? Maybe we should beware of all Amazon products.
2,Poorly Made,"I've used this product about a dozen or so times and I guess it did what it was supposed to do. But the element clips have broken of the bottom and burned a hole in the unit. It does take a long time to dry food, due to the passive heat operation. Even as a starter dehydrator I would probably pass on this and try a Nesco model. I received this unit as a gift, and it did help me determine if i would use it enough to buy a better unit though."
3,"Works, but isn't made very well","I purchased this dehydrator because it was cheaper AND ronco. It sucks. I've gotten my $40 worth of use of it though.Within the first 3 uses 1 tray broke. I've had it less than 6 months now, used it maybe 6 times, and all of the trays are broken in some way. The heating element has broken off its plastic clips, and even melted part of the dehydrator. Do yourself a favor and buy a more expensive, durable item. This would be great for someone who only plans on using it once, or only occasionally, but if you plan on making your food on a regular basis, its not worth the money. I plan on replacing it soon, I'll have to, my trays won't be able to take another 1 or 2 uses."
2,Forget About It....,If you do not mind running up your electric bill and waiting forever on food to dry then go right ahead and by this dehydrator... I bought and returned it right away! GET A NESCO THEY ACTUALLY DO THINGS IN ONE DAY!
4,Great Product for the Price,"At first, I had purchased a different dehydrator. I was so disappointed in it that I returned it as defective to the manufacturer, and ordered this one instead. It works well, especially for the price. If you are using the dehydrator to do massive amounts of food, you will be here a while, but if you are using it occasionally or to make snacks, preserve smaller amounts of food, it's perfect. I can fit 2 medium apples per tray, and there are 5 trays, so about 10 apples at a time. It takes varying amounts of time to dry the food based on how you slice it, however it's never more than a day and a half. Also, it's quiet - no fan. I LOVE that. You do have to rotate the trays, but it doesn't take any effort to do so. I would recommend this product to a friend :)"
3,ya get what ya pay for,"The bottom 3 racks melted after leaving it on over night. And this thing is incredibly difficult to clean after you make jerky or anything that will seep. if you have a pressure washer in the garage then you'r in luck this will be a fun little toy, if not I would go ahead and spend the money on a better product."
2,I'm a little disappointed,"I got this for Christmas. I've had a lot of fun with it and it makes great dried fruit. I even made some crackers wtih it. I've used it a lot, but it's a month old and some of the trays have melted and gone out of shape. I think if you are going to use a dehydrator a lot, you will be happier with one that has sturdier construction."
1,Awful Experience,We borrowed a Ronco dehydrator from my mother-in-law that she'd stored for a while. We used it a couple times when the heating element went out. We figured that this was because it was old so I attempted to order a new one. I ordered the 5 tray dehydrator with the accessory pack which has the extra trays and fruit roll up things directly from Ronco. Read the fine print - 4 to 6 weeks delivery time! After waiting 2 months I called them to find out why I hadn't received it only to be informed that the accessory pack was on back order but if I would like my dehydrator and accessory pack WITHOUT the extra trays then they could go ahead and ship it to me and I should receive it in 15 to 20 business days. The lady was very unhelpful and didn't understand why I didn't want the accessory pack without the extra trays. I told her that I didn't place the order to wait 3 months or more for my order to be incomplete but cost me full price. I am ordering a different one from Amazon. NOT a Ronco!
1,Do NOT Buy!,"I use to have a Ronco Food Dehydrator a long time ago, and I wanted a new one. I only got one use out of it. The trays are make of a CHEAP PLASTIC that MELTS into and onto the food. I am so mad, I tried to contact Ronco to complain and the person from India on the phone could not understand me, and hung upon me. I follwed the directions to the T, even numbering the trays and rotating them as said in the manual. I don't know why things that are made today are so bad, when the exact same product bought ten years ago worked fine. I just thought I would warn any potential buyer of this BAD PRODUCT."
2,food dehydrator,Very quiet. That is the only plus. Dehydrates meat ok but literally takes days to do fruits. There are no lights or switches to indicate that the machine is own. The ony wa you know it works is to wait.
2,Really disapointed,"I did not like it, because it takes to long to dehydtrate food, it takes about 2 days and you have to constantly moving the panels, I have seen other Dehydators you can adjust the teparature and definetley they are much faster than this one."
1,WARNING...WARNING...DO NOT BUY,"DO NOT BUY PRODUCTI just used this product fo rthe FIRST time. Had I looked at the costumer reviews first I wouldn't be complaining right now because I wouldn't have bought the product.My first time using this product, I did Kale & Spinach Chips and when I look at the trays once chips where done. I notice that they are melted in some area's. Of couse I come on and read the reviews after the fact and I'm upset....Please DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this product.Now I guess I have to buy another one :-( THIS TIME I will look at the reviews...."
1,Absolute rubbish,This product is completely useless - DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Spend a little more and get something that actually works.
2,defective,The tray melted with the first use. I called Ronco and they were no help as to replacing the trays. They sais I could buy new trays at $ 10.00 each plus s&h.
3,"It works, but not well","No thermostat or timer (not absolutely required but would have been nice). My main complaint is that the trays melted while making beef jerky. I bought this because I didn't need anything fancy, and it looked sturdier than the other low end dehydrators. I was wrong."
1,Dont buy this item,I bought this item in the hopes to utilize my fresh fruit to the fullest. Immediately the plastic trays started melting. My dried fruit tastes funny (like plastic) and now I cant use the machine. I dont understand how a company can make a product this defective.
2,Burnt taste,"No matter how much I rotate the trays, if it gets dehydrated, there is a burnt flavor. If I just wanted a little dry, that's fine, but that's not what I bought a dehydrator for. After reading some of the reviews, I think I will try to call Ronco though I'm not sure it would do much good. I've had this thing for a while now and it is a dust collector in my basement."
2,Should have read the reviews! Don't bother with this one.,The trays burn and it doesn't heat properly or evenly. I did make some turkey-jerky but that was the only thing I got out of this. It began to malfunction after a week or so of use. The trays don't rotate right either. I won't bother with returning it based on the experiences others have had. I will count it as a $35 lesson learned!
2,Luckily I was home!,"This is my second dehydrator, I got rid of the first one in a move. A huge mistake. My first second time using the Ronco the bottom tray melted 15 minutes. Everything was properly in place, the top vents were fully open, and I only was dehydrating pineapple slices. My suggestion would be go for a more reliable model, or make sure you are home while it is in use.About a month later and I am still trying to clean bits of melted plastic off the coils so I can salvage my purchase."
1,Don't Do It!,"Don't buy this Ronco Dehydrator. The trays melted and cracked after one use! And of course, it was past the 30 day return date. Ronco was willing to replace the trays after much discussion, but why? It's just going to happen again. Most expensive jerky I ever made."
1,You get what you pay for.,Not very impresive. Used it the frist time making beef jerky and it melted all the trays. I rotated every tray but its hard to stay up all night. I guess you get what you pay for because this machine is now an expensive paper weight.
1,RONCO Burnt trays,"DO NOT BUY!!! I reported Ronco to BBB. They made 2 contacts with them asking for us to collaborate on a solution. Never heard one word from Ronco. BBB did not hear from them either. How can this company get away with this? Where is our consumer protection? Below is my original complaint:Seeing all of the complaints about the burnt trays and noting several of you saying that Ronco has not satisfactorily responded, I am requesting that each of you file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, as I have. I had an old Ronco that I used for more than a decade and loved it. It wore out, so I got a new one (model FD1005WHGEN) for Christmas. This one is a cheap substitute. As with other reviews, all of my trays burned and melted on first use. I NEVER had this problem with the old one. While cleaning it, I realized that this is an inferior material than what they used before.I agree, DO NOT BUY!!!"
2,Not a good deal,I purchased this dehydrator about a year ago and had to replace the tray about 3 times now. With in a couple weeks of use the trays will start to crack and split down the middle. Yes the Dehydrator is under a 1 year warranty bu the trays are not included in that warranty. If you plan on using your dehydrator more than 3 times a month don't waste your time and by this unit.
2,Why did the Ronco trays melt down?,I used this for the first time to dehydrate chicken livers for my dog. It was on for 24 hours when we began to smell something. Some of the trays had melted. What a mess. Livers ruined and machine an absolute mess. I had a Ronco for 30 years and it finally wore out. That is why I bought a new one. What a mistake.
1,Fire hazard,"It took a little bit longer than most of the other reviewers, but eventually all the trays melted away. We used this product sporadically so we can't even blame heavy use. This is a major fire hazard. Do not buy. I give it one star because it made it through a whole year before it fell apart."
1,disappointed in Ronco,"I am very disappointed I bought 3 of these,because in the past I had one and it work wonderful for many years. How ever this time all three of these melted and I had to throw away the meat not knowing what penetrated the meat. Amazon was great but Ronco was not so. Will not ever buy a Ronco item again."
2,Poor Quality and even less Customer Service!,"We have had one of the original Ronco dehydrator for many, many years and were very happy. I purchased the new one for Christmas. After the very FIRST use, ALL the trays melted! We've contact Ronco Customer Service several times with no response. I'm very disappointed with the lack of quality put into the product and even more disappointed with the lack of service help. I can NOT recommend this product at all."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,I PURCHASED THIS IN AUGUST AND THE FIRST TIME I USED IT WORKED FINE BUT SMELLED LIKE SOMETHING WAS BURNING. I GOT IT OUT LAST NIGHT AND I'M SURPRISED MY HOUSE DIDN'T BURN DOWN. THE WIRES IN THE BOTTOM OF IT MELTED SO NOW ITS DUMPSTER TIME.
3,It is what it is,"Cracks me up all the 1 star reviews from a bunch of people that didn't read the description. It's a $39 dehydrator from Ronco - what did you expect?Look, there's better than this available. I've owned this and it's fine and I got to learn about dehydrating with it. I got my money's worth an am ready to move up to better.If you want to learn too, then it's a fine purchase."
1,"Very disappointing, you get what you pay for",I have the Ronco and it does not dry tomatoes very well. I had the unit plugged in for two days and it only managed to start growing mold on my tomatos. So if you want to culture bacteria this is the one to get otherwise get a unit with a fan and a heater built in such as the Nesco or the Excalibur.
1,Ronco,The tray cracked and broke open as the product cooled. It heated fine and all directions were followed but the trays simply did not hold up.
1,Ronco 5 Tray Food DeHydrator,"I purchased the Ronco 5-tray food dehydrator (without the fan) and I warn all others out there to NOT, I repeat NOT, purchase this item. After using it for 3 days with rotation of the trays and constant supervision, the trays ALL warped and two of them even had burned holes through them. The customer service at Ronco was not helpful and very rude so I will not purchase Ronco products again. You would think that a food dehydrator would be made to withstand the heat....DUH!!!! I wish I had read these reviews before purchasing as it seems this is a very unanimous opinion. The American Harvest dehydrator rocks!!!!!!!"
1,Pathetic,"The trays melted!! Why would a company even make trays that could melt when used? Are they trying to poison everyone who buys their product? This is the first Ronco product that I have ever bought, and it will surely be the last! I used the manual, and did my foods like it instructed, and the trays melted. Wow."
3,Dehydrator,I like to item but was upset that when I used it did the recipe for beef jerky in the book that came with it and acouple of the trays are now spilt open on the grid. I am still using it though.
1,Not worth the plastic it's made from,"After following the limited instructions available, I decided to make jerky over Christmas weekend for my dogs. Long story short, the product overheated, melted the tray closest to the heating units and almost caused a fire. Will NOT purchase another. Contacting Ronco today."
2,Questionable Quality,"I purchased this product 11/12/2010, I've used it four times since then to do beef jerky and for the most part aside from the inconvenience of having to rotate the trays I've been satisfied with the results. One major problem I found is the quality of the material or the design. After the second use I noticed that the plastic weaving begun to split and shrink. I'm in the process of trying to get it returned and plan to use the money towards a better quality food dehydrator even if I have to pay more. I always read the reviews before I make a purchase on line, this time I didn't bother and here are the results."
1,"It is not in ""New"" condition",I ordered a new product and paid a purchase price for a new Food Dehydrator.Ronco FD1005WHGEN 5-Tray Electric Food DehydratorOne of the trays has a crack in it and the lid is scuffed around 1/3 of the rim.
1,poorly made.,"i opened the box witch by the way was falling apart, to be severely disappointed by what a saw. cheep plastic trays, with a small heating element. the holes in the trays are so large that peas will fall through when dehydrated. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ITEM. i will be sending back today!"
1,Awful.,"I got this as a gift and was excited to use it. After just two uses, the trays already started melting and cracking. It was also very difficult to order the fruit roll up trays from their website--so I had to order a different brand. After my trays melted, I tossed the machine and am now spending more to get a better quality machine."
2,Junky! Trays melted,I really like this at first but after a few uses the trays all began to melt. It is difficult to clean also. I am researching a better dehydrator because I love making beef jerky. Avoid this one unless you want to continually replace it.
1,Absolutely horrible,"I'm not going to waste my time expanding on what 43 other people who rated this as 1 star have already said. Brand new,used twice, trays melted. That about covers it. Look for something else."
1,Dead on Arrival!,"Brand new and defective!! Beautiful watch, but the battery is dead on arrival. And I am so disappointed on how cheap that band is! Doesn't fit well at all and looks cheesy. For $112 I expected better. I am returning it immediately."
3,ok watch,"this was a 5 star watch for the first year i had it but a few months ago one of the arms bent so that it cant move anymore. also the band was huge, i had to cut my own hole in it"
1,Buy the cheaper version in the grocery store,"NO STARS. I am unhappy with the purchase. After 3 months the watch loses 5 min/day and is worthless as a time piece. Now I need to send it away to have it fixed... and how long will that take ? Now I will have to buy a cheap watch in the store to have a watch while it is being repaired. My advice is, DO NOT BUY watches online ! Go to a reputable store so you can take it back if it does not work. Swiss army watches are not what they used to be."
4,Great Work watch,"I ordered this watch because I have heard of the excellent workmanship of Swiss Army Watches..I am working in the Middle East and needed a rugged watch that would take the sand, and heat. I found the perfect watch for my needs. The watch is good looking too. Keeps perfect time, and is comfortible to wear in the heat. The only thing that I would like to see is longer lasting glow on the hands, and dial..but its not really a problem for my needs.I would recommend this watch"
1,HORRIBLE,AWFUL AWFUL!! High price for a CHEAPLY made product. OH and their customer service is a joke. Tried to order replacement parts that were covered under warranty and received a run around. Took 6 weeks to get the wrong part!!!!!! The rating got one star because I could not give it less.
1,Consider the Source,"I know that this is an ad hominem blurb . I worked at Maclean Hospital for many years. People's (patients and staff's) response to Gunderson's cruelty is commonplace . He has most recently been portrayed in the book Mount Misery through the character ""Heiler."" John Gunderson is well known for his arrogance and cruelty by legions of Maclean staff and patients through the years. You have my condolences to anyone for having endured his company. My advise is to not take him personally. He's been like that with most everybody since he started in 1969. Simply ask virtually anyone who has met him (colleague or patient.)"
1,Utter tripe,"John Gunderson diagnosed me with Borderline Personality Disorder five years ago. I've finally gotten around to reading his book and it's pseudoscientific nonsense not worth the paper it's written on. For therapy, I plan to shred his book, mix it with manure, and compost it, and I highly recommend you buy Rodale's Book of Composting instead of this mindless piece of pulp."
5,I Fagiolini (not Robin Blaze)!,"Just a quickie to let the reader know that this is an I Fagiolini recording (with the English Cornett and Sackbut Ensemble). Robin Blaze does indeed appear on the recording as part of the team but even Robin wouldn't even say that it was his recording!I conceived this recording and I direct the group so I'm not the most impartial person to review it - but it has been done with a lot of love, care and at times humour (including two filthy Venetian old men's songs) and I'd recommend it heartily. Go to www.ifagiolini.com for more info."
5,A Creative Writing Student's Dreambook,"There's a lot going on in this small volume --- sociology and history of upper Michigan through the McCormick family of Chicago, minimalist and maximalist short stories, some postmodern and pre-postmodern (even traditional) poetry, and creative (so-called) nonfiction. Here's an author who loves to write; and it shows. This book will be around a long time."
3,"Works well, a bit big for cats","The Bamboo Cat Nail Clipper with built in styptic and file works well. The blades seem larger and heavier than necessary. They would still work well with slightly smaller and lighter blades. The handle portion, however, is purr-fectly sized for easy gripping, especially with a wiggling cat!"
3,Not what i thought,"I bought it thinking it was going to be smaller than what they are. These are large size, actually the same size as my dog's clippers. I tried these out on my cat and she freaked out by the size, but they were sharp enough to cut one nail before she flipped her lid. If you have a dog these would be great not meant for cats."
2,Manipulation,"So basically I can sum this flick up in one word, manipulation. Instead of being 'jerks' these two guys are tugging at this girls heartstrings playing the other side of the 'jerk' mentality. Giving her what she wants, using her desires against her to get her with themselves. As far as I can tell she isn't doing any better with the two guys trying to get in her pants. The only difference is these guys are desperate enough to stay!The movie isn't what I would call a romantic or a comedy, it's more depressing really and drags on and on with pointless directions that really don't add much to the story at all. I'm not sure why the movie had to go the additional mile after she decided who she wanted to be with."
3,weak story of confused woman,Not a great film by any means. The star is attractive but wasted on this story.
2,"its not bad, but not good either","Ok I watched this movie and Ill give it 2 stars. the story line is somewhat interesting, realistic, but kind of dragged on after 2/3 of the film. the ending was there tho so you should watch the whole thing.sadly not alot to say about the characters cuz they never really gave any impression at all that would contribute to the movie. even right now i dont even remember anybody's names.. friends family whos who. thats how much I was paying attention to this film."
2,Not a comedy,"The box cover makes this look like a comedy. It's not. Only get this movie if you aren't expecting laughs.It's a drama about a woman who decides that she sleeps around too much, and so she's going to be celibate for the next 90 days."
1,"Boring, Empty","I rented this movie because Marguerite Moreau looked hot on the box. But she didn't look nearly as good in the movie. Her character was a smoking (gross), bed-hopping slob who looked like she harbored every STD known to man. And she thinks she has to sleep with every guy she meets in order to find love (silly). Really no focus in this movie, not enjoyable."
5,Great romantic and realistic movie,This is a great movie that has a realistic and romantic feel to it. The movie has unexpected twists and is super sexy.
3,Not what it could have been,Shallow in the script and copied in many other movies. If you do not expect too much then watch this movie.
2,Lacks convention knowledge,"I have been playing this program for several years. The playing itself is okay it's the bidding that drives me crazy. Occasionally my partner will open with a 3-card major! Also, whoever wrote the program did not include the Blackwood, Gerber or Stayman conventions so if you are entertaining the thought of a slam bid, you are basically on your own to guess what your partner has in the way of HCP's. If I forget this fact and bid Blackwood, my partner will always pass at 4 NT. Ugh!"
1,Don't Buy This Game!!!,"this is a TERRIBLE program! here are several things that are wrong with the programming:1) the software is buggy - when you undo the bids to redo the bidding, the program often doesn't show you the bidding box, leaving you no choice but to deal a new hand.2) the program doesn't show you everyone's hand at the end, so you can't analyze what should have happened3) the 'tutor' plays like a beginner - it takes all the tricks off the top - doesn't know how to set up tricks or set up transportation.4) the online portion doesn't appear to let you simply watch games, in order to learn, as other online programs do (you know, the ones that only support windows...)5) the bidding box is cumbersome - it takes 2 clicks to make a bid, rather than just one, and God forbid you make a mistake! especially on-line, there doesn't appear to be a way to alert you opponents and ask to correct the bid."
1,only if you want your partner to be playing against you,"I have had this for years. My son bought it for me. When I got it, I had to pay for it again and the game still wouldn't let me change the 'dummies' from playing stupid. If you were taking the trick with an ace, you partner played a king. Very frustrating. I emailed the game and they couldn't help me. Very expensive for all that frustration."
1,Disappointed,Received this as a Christmas gift and was very disappointed. It isn't anywhere near as good as Omar Sharif's Bridge for Windows. Now I'm wondering how much of a mistake I made in buying an Apple laptop!
1,Bad review,"I guess I misjudged what this product was about. I wanted some honest to goodness bridge practice. From the goofy characters to the off the wall bidding and rank beginner play, this bridge game is a flop."
1,Old edition,This is an old old version. I have a more recent edition and was hoping to get a new one.
2,3D Bridge Deluxe is OK,"I purchased Bridge Baron 22 along with 3D Bridge Deluxe. The first represents an excellent vehicle for entertainment and practice, as it provides for user replay as well as computer replay. My wife won't bother with Bridge Baron, preferring 3D Bridge because of the characters who play in the game. We both have found the 3D opponents' bidding to be somewhat haphazard, and there is no way to review the hand other than via screenshot. Since I have a hard time digging up bridge buddies, 3D Bridge at least provides an outlet for play. It also took several emails to Freeverse to iron out the expired key code for registration."
1,Not running =((,I purchased your game because it said it would run on Mac OS X. I am running Lion. It did not work. What a bummer! Lost my time!
3,3 D Bridge Deluxe,"I have been looking for an interactive bridge instruction CD. Unfortunately, this product doesn't help in learning how to bid and play. It has cute icons but the user is not able to play against the program and learn."
4,neo hippie funk soul for yo mama? not really.,"I had the opportunity to meet Chris Murray recently at an intimate show. What a nice guy. He is perhaps one of the more overlooked songwriters out there right now, but the reason is obvious -- he writes ska tunes. While some folks may not fault him for that, a whole bunch more are going to. But, this new material is definitely a step in the right direction. With hook laden melodies and a powerful voice, Murray is doing everything right on this cd, and I think more people then just ska-scenesters will appreciate it. For those of you who don't know, Chris Murray plays ska influenced music on an acoustic guiter. He does record straight to cassette on a four-track. No slick overdubs, or phil specter tape echo here. Just Murray and his music."
1,I Can't Agree Enough,"Jody Hamilton is a landscape gardener who is in one of her best friends' wedding and is determined to test the faith of the oily fiancee. The plot is shaky, the sex few and far between, there are far too many characters and I really do feel like I am reading a Harlequin Presents. I really wish that I had read the reviews before I bought the book because now I am stuck with a worthless novel. Don't waste your time with this one. Awful."
1,Pretty bad.,"Here's the synopsis: Girl goes to best friend's wedding, encounters the usual, and some of the least interesting Black-Lace-required scenes I've ever seen, too many characters complicate what should be a simple plot, and girl, Jodi, thinks she has found true love.Here's my recommendation. Skip this one. It is boring, clinical, and reads like erotica written by some one who has only read one occasionally spicy sex manual."
1,wake me up when it's over........,"is this a black lace book? no passion here and the few sex scenes are clinical. sorry miss morgan, but i thought i was reading a text book. ho hum - it was that exciting........"
5,"A lively, toe-tapping musical experience that transcends borders with its sheer enthusiasm and vivacity","Boban Markovic, ""The King of Balkan Brass"", and his ten-member Orkestar, Serbia's leading brass band, have won numerous awards over the past ten years at the annual Guca Brass Band Festival. The Promise - The King of Balkan Brass is their latest music CD album, featuring Boban's original music accompanied by Markovic's talented, trumpet-blowing son Marko. The Promise is Boban Markovic's first all-studio production, and like his previous albums, is solidly rooted in Gypsy folk tunes. A lively, toe-tapping musical experience that transcends borders with its sheer enthusiasm and vivacity. English text information is included. 55 min."
2,Disappointing CD after hearing concert,"I bought this CD after hearing a Boban Markovic concert. The concert was pretty good and the music had a lot of energy and even some melody. This CD is not like the concert - the beats are not great for dancing and the melodies are just not there. For the fans of Boban Markovic, I'm sure this is a great CD but for others it might be an acquired taste."
5,Best single-topic civil war book I have read,"I learned at least as much about how armies and officers operate from this book as from any 2 I have read, and it's a darn good read too."
4,The Best Of Sears,"""Chancellorsville"" is the finest work to date by the author, Stephen Sears. The book is incredibly well researched, covering events before, during and after the battle. Unlike some of Sears' earlier works (e.g., ""Landscape Turned Red: The Battle Of Antietam""), I found ""Chancellorsville"" to be an even-handed, unbiased account of events. The book is an easy read and will be understood even by the novice Civil War buff. If I had to point out one weakness, it would be Sears' lack of details concerning certain parts of the battle. The author certainly did extensive research and possessed the information - it was simply not included in the text. But then I am thinking of the type of detail presented in the masterpieces by John M. Priest on South Mountain and Antietam. Perhaps such detail was not the goal of Sears. In any event, Sears has written an informative and insightful book - an honor and a delight to read."
5,Essential Civil War reading,"Sears has written us another masterwork. It's extremely well-researched and full of first-person observations about the characters, the landscape, the glory, and the terror. Sears has some very good theories on the sources of failure for what began as a very promising campaign. If I were to wish for more in this text, it would be greater insight into Lee's perceptions and motivations and some of the dramatic flair and political analysis Sears brought to his accounts of Antietam and the Peninsula campaign"
5,Superlative,"As a non-Civil War buff, I never thought I could make it through an entire book about a single battle. I couldn't have been more wrong. Sears' superlatively written, authoritatively researched book was absolutely engrossing. Sears includes details that give the story a novelistic feel. For example, the book opens with a shocking scene in which two Union generals visit Abraham Lincoln to request that he get rid of Ambrose Burnside, then the commander of the Army of the Potomac. Sears goes on to chronicle the big decisions and little mistakes that ended up turning the tide in a critical Civil War battle."
3,Not durable,"The paper is fine, but the front and back cover are only slightly thicker than the paper they surround, meaning this notebook will be damaged easily if you carry it around at all. There are surely better options."
1,cheating,"The picture make you think you will get a couple of notebooks in all sorts of colors, but you actually only get one and they choose the color for you. This price is as double as walmart price, and the paper quality is poor. Don't buy it, go to walmart or target."
3,Good product for price,"I liked these notebooks. I would buy them again. The only qualm I have is that they don't have the ""tear line"" to allow you to tear out the page with out all the fringy stuff."
3,It's a notebook with thin covers.,"Pros:It's a notebook.The pages aren't black.It contains 100 pages.Cons:Back and front covers are very thin card stock.Overall assessment: good notebook if you aren't too rough with it. Seems like it'll fall apart faster than other notebooks, but if you're only looking at the price per page, this 100 page notebook is still a very good deal. I'd advise keeping it in a binder when not actively using it."
5,great buy,"the only thing I can say about this notebook is it is great for your notes and jotting things down for future refference.great for school,best for high school and college"
3,skip it,"For some reason the front and back cover is really fragile. Not paper thin exactly, but close. The paper is fine but it's not really the strongest or best on the market either. Perhaps your best bet is to just spend a few extra dollars for a more reliable and durable alternative because this notebook was obviously not created under the realization that the paper needs to be crammed between books all day while walking from class to class. The professor won't be happy about a crinkled paper being handed to him and might even dock a few points."
1,floppy and cheap,"The back cover is totally flop-tastic. You can't write on this notebook without putting it on a hard surface. Unless you're always going to be at a desk, don't buy it."
2,Order got messed up,"I ordered i think 4 70-sheet notebook spirals, and 2 100-sheet sprials from this company that sent me the wrong items from SAM'S club?? But I didnt return the 2 1oo-sheet spirals along with the 4 120-sheet spirls? because 1. I didnt feel like waiting for them any longer when I needed them for school 2. So that i wouldn't spend any more money on more page spirals at walmart or office depot so it's okay that my order got wrong. I had already ordered 70 sheet spirals of Mead from another company just in case it happened... They are nice notebooks though. Paper quality is a bit thicker than your average thin ..smearable paper if you write with pencil alot (which I don't unless its a math or number involved class)I like them."
4,A fantasy on your computer.,"This is a very cool set. I tried the first one, but it's not very good when you look at HOMM2 & HOMM3. The graphics, gameplay, and units that are available are much better than the first one. The gameplay is very challenging and if you sit back and try to build up your forces, they are doing the same thing, and since they always have a head start on you, you are just settign yourself up for disaster. There are many scenarios to play and you can also just play a map against the computer if you want. Has map editor so you can make your own maps to play. This game can be replayed time after time."
1,3DO made a failure and a waste of money by making this game,"Why did I buy this game? I need to find a good game,but when I turn to 3DO, I get a game which is ultimately boring, and is hardly understandable. This is why I would rate this stupid, dumb, game as a 1 (if I could I would make it a 0) out of 5."
4,Good information,"I wasn't looking for the amount of detail on actually buying, and feeding the animals, just packing them in! But all in all, great book! Especially for the absolute novice!"
5,Amazing,"I recieved this as a christmas gift and instantly fell in love. The turban is weightless, cute, and drys hair fast. The button closure at the back is the best, because now I don't have to worry about having it fall off of my head! Truly brilliant product (no wonder it's always back ordered!)."
2,I just don't get it!,"I really want to like this Mary Daheim series of Bed and Breakfast Mysteries. I am a devout fan of her other series, The Alpine books. But time and again I keep shaking my head at the lead character, Judith's, actions. Why in the world would she want her foul mouthed, disagreeable, insulting mother any where near her? Any normal person would be dancing a jig to get some distance between them! And this worrying about what Joe thinks....it's her house, and if he didn't like anything, I'd tell him to take a hike!! Please!The end to this mystery is so convuluted one would need a chart to try to figure it out. I've read all the previous novels in this series, and keep hoping that they will live up to their sister series, the Alpine novels. Not yet.I've read much worse books, but this one is certainly no mystery classic."
3,3.5,Angie Stone clearly has a edge over the Female acts out now for She brings feeling into Her Work.Her Vocals&Musical Arrangements go hand&hand with Her Structure.the only knock here is that the Album lasts a bit to long&things could have been paired down.but nevertheless Angie Stone is a Artist that you gotta pay attention to.
5,Angie is the Queen,"First off, this album is amazing. AS has been doing what Jill Scott and others are doing now for years. I was working in the studio where a lot of this was recorded, schlepping gear around and setting up for them, as well as taking care of whatever they needed otherwise. Not only does she write amazing music, but most of her songs are written on the fly. She sits down at a Rhodes in the studio and just goes. This process is a testament of how her music makes the listener feel. She writes it in ""the groove"" and it surely takes you exactly where she was mentally and spiritually when she wrote it. For those of you who have never heard her....BUY HTIS ALBUM! For those who love and respect Angie....I hope some day your job gives you the pleasure that Angie gave me sitting and listening to ""Pissed Off"" (among others) being recorded and getting paid for it! Love this record!"
2,Even duller than the debut...,"The only cuts on the album that really stand out are ""Brotha"" and ""Make Love"", a duet with Musiq Soulchild (that stands out because of the obvious influence of Musiq's talent). Her songwriting is tight as usual, however the beats seem to drown in a dull sameness one could only describe as lame. This a very overrated sophmore follow-up. She could certainly improve her production roster by inlisting fellow neo-soul peers like the Soulquarians or Touch of Jazz. Please do not expect an album balanced around the current single ""Brotha"". If you are looking to satisfy your neo-soul desires, pass this album and get Red Star Sounds Vol. 1- Soul Searching and Hidden Beach Unwrapped Vol. 1, you'll thank me later."
3,Good Effort,"There are some decent songs on this album and Ms. Stone's voice is not bad at all, however this music didn't grab me. I think her choice of material is much weaker than what she could pull off. ""I Wish I Didn't Miss You"" is not only the standout cut, but the standard at which the whole album should have been. Honarable mention goes to ""Brotha"" for the positive message."
4,Make the choice,"There is alot of good mature R&B coming out lately and this is the top choice for 2002 funkonauts. The musicians in her band are what sets this apart from the rest of the audiofilth played on urban radio these days. Mahogany Soul is straight midtempo avenue ready funk with vintage Ford-era guitars and keyboards. The sureshot joints are Soul Insurance, Wish I did'nt miss U and the chillout hour groove Snowflakes. Peace."
4,Gone Ms. Stone!,"What can I say...a friend of mine picked up the CD and we listened to it back from ATL...I knew then I had to pick it up...She is soulsational.. Unlike others, I really emjoyed her first CD (another review, another time).. The emotional openness she displays in her music is very engaging...The opening with Soul Insurance with its infectious baseline is my official get ""crunk"" song...takes you back to diamond in the back sunroof top diggin the seen with a gangsta lean feel...With two very strong duets in the smooth soulful More than a Woman and the Musiq laced (I haven't checked yet, but I'd bet Musiq produced it) How Do We Make Love...The humor of Time of the Month (can I get a witness Ladies...)I simply loved this albumn...I didn't give it a five though, cause fives should be used sparingly, and there are some elements I feel Ms. Stone is missing for a total five...A must have for the true fans of Soul Music...."
5,now that's what I call music!,"If you love soul music, this is the cd for you! Angie is the epitome of a soul-singing sista. Add to the mix a little Musiq Soulchild on ""Ingedients of Love"" & Calvin Richardson on ""More Than a Woman"" and you've got some beautiful soul duets. Additional stand-outs include the very uplifting hit ""Brotha"", ""Wish I Didn't Miss You"", ""Snowflakes"", ""Pissed Off"", ""Mad Issues"" & ""Soul Insurance"". There's no song on this cd that I didn't like. I highly recommend it. Right on, Angie!"
5,Making A Claim on my Soul Insurance with Angie Stone,"Oh my! Where shall I begin? If you truly enjoyed Angie Stone's debut album, Black Diamond, you will be floored by the beautiful music of this album. Even if you are a semi-Angie Stone fan, but a major music fan, you should STILL buy this album. WHY? Where shall I start? The mix of old-school rhythms (the O'Jay's ""Backstabbers"", Al Green's ""20 Dollars"") and new-school lyrics (""Mad Issues"") makes this album a must buy for your collection. This one will be a classic. You can be in several different moods (love, anger, depression, happiness, praise [Brotha]), and put on this CD and at least one of those songs will fit your mood. All of the music is beautiful, absolutely beautiful. Even though D'Angelo is not on this album, anywhere, you can hear his influence in several of the songs"
5,Looooove it!,"Angie, Angie, Angie...you have done it again! Lately, I've been hard pressed to throw away my hard earned money on a lot of these so called 'artists' but Mahogany Soul was money well spent! Check her out people, she's gonna be around for a while."
3,Straight Soul with no chaser,"Angie Stone often is associated with the neo-soul movement. This is a misnomer. She is a straight soul singer from the 70's and she has proved that on Mahogany Soul her sophomore effort. With her ode to the Black Man on Brotha and the no good man anthem Easier Said Than Done, she covers the whole spectrum of emotions dealing with love , happiness and heartache. She also covers the Makings Of You ..a Curtis Mayfield written/Gladys Knight performed song that happens to be one of my all time favorites ..You go soul sista....this soul brotha loves you too..hint hint ladies let your man know when he's doing right there's enough of the gender war songs being played on radio Angie shows you (when he's right or wrong)how to do it with class and soul"
5,Baby making music,"Again, Angie Stone remains A Rock. Music for when you're happy, sad, horny, stressed, angry, PMSin. Music for woman, man and everything in between. Angie Stone is the master of her own soulful world. The man who gave this CD to me has no idea how abolutely addicted I am to Mahogany Soul. Fabulous, just fabulous."
4,Great music,"This CD is in heavy rotation in my player. It's something that I can just put in and let play, unlike so many others that I have where I have to skip half the disc before the ""good"" music starts. To sum up the CD in one word...soulful. A must have for music fans."
4,Mahogany Soul,"I like this album, and it is obvious that Ms. Stone had alot to do with it's development. Angie Stone seems to be on a quest to revive the sound of the seventies and out a twist of today in there as well. I would say that she is succeeding, with evidence on tracks like More than a Woman, Ingredents of Love, and the head bopper Brotha. If you liked Black Diamond, you'll love Mahogany Soul.Peace Hedz & Keep The Music Alive"
3,Good second effort,"Angie Stone's first cd, Black Diamond, was a nice surprise and led to high expectations for this second cd. Angie is a true singer in every sense of the word, but I was a little let down. I also agree with the previous reviewers - the cd could have been pared down a little. The standout cuts are ""What U Dyin' For"", ""Wish I Didn't Miss You"" and her duets with Calvin and Musiq Soulchild. Her current single ""Brotha"" is okay, but I get the feeling it was made specifically for maximum radio airplay. Her remake of the Curtis Mayfield song ""Makings of You"" is nice and sweet. In spite of its minor shortcomings, I would recommend this cd because Angie can sing. If you are tired of hearing songs with stupid lyrics (i.e. ""Bootylicious"") and rappers singing about pimping and their ""bling bling"", Angie's cd is a nice alternative."
4,Excellent!,"I appreciate when we have artist that aren't afraid to be ""real"" and produce ""real"" music. Angie Stone has done that with this latest project! I highly recommend it to the ""real"" music lovers."
5,Strictly for the ladies-GET THIS!!!!,"With the exception of the song ""Brotha"", this album is strictly for the ladies. There is a song for all times of the day, week, MONTH, you name it, its here. This is my way of incorporating some of the titles of the tracks alone as they pertain to me. I'm ""more than a woman"" but I get so ""pissed off"" because I get ""mad issues"" during that ""time of the month"". I want ""soul insurance"" but its ""easier said than done"". ""I wish I didn't miss you"" but ""life goes on""."
2,would not order again,"I ordered a set of vent visors for my 99 f150 and loved them. They fit into the window channel, which gives them a sleek, finished look. The set that I ordered for my Excursion are attached to the vehicles paint with double sided tape. I think they look hokey, like a cheap aftermarket product. If I ever order another set, I will find a set that fits in the window channel."
4,Even I can do these!,"I first got hooked on ""CrissCross"" when I picked up a puzzle magazine for my senior mother in London. I got stuck in the airport coming home and broke out her magazine. I made a mess of it because I didn't get very far on any of them, let alone solve them. After I got home I picked this book up and had a field day! I could actually do these. They are not easy but they are unique, challenging and just plain do-able. I especially like that each puzzle here has a theme too. I cannot wait until the next one (hopefully)comes out."
3,Lovely story,"Beautiful story of redemption and healing. I think that much of the story is believable and not unlike something that could happen in any time period. I love all of Ellen Gunderson Traylor's books. I felt that this story was ~almost~ very well developed, but not quite. It was an easy read, and I read this story through quickly; however, I never felt completely drawn into the story--something was lacking. The characters were not developed or believable enough to feel their emotions and their life. I would not ever discourage reading it, it is a great story, but it is not high on my recommendation list. My favorites of hers are still Song of Abraham and John-son of Thunder."
3,Not Quite Convincing--But a Good Read!,"Irwin is a well-known critic of Edward Said and ""Orientalism"". Here he marshals his considerable intellectual resources to define a workable timeline of Orientalist knowledge in order to make his essential point that Said was a late comer to this area of studies and didn't even know very much about it, being politically motivated in his outlook.Does he succeed? Not quite. No doubt Irwin is far more knowledgeable than Said ever was about the history of Orientalism, but he fails to deal convincingly with Said's essential point that Orientalism was a biased body of knowledge that existed mostly for the purpose of subjugating the East. Furthermore, his hatred for Said's ideas sometimes teeters on the edge of paranoia. Nevertheless, this book provides a detailed history of Orientalist studies in the West from the very beginnings of Islam to the modern reemergence of religious conflict."
3,what no stand offs,the thing i liked about the freeza saga was that they fight with each of his three different forms without the fights what happens to the show and goku then faught with 100 percent freeza form freeza saga had more fights
4,Nice version of DBZ,"I got this copy of DBZ because I really liked the show when I watched it on TV on my country, Chile.So I wanted to see the show on its original language and good video quality, so I purchased this version on Blu Ray. I was really impressed with the sound and video Quality and overall presentation.I don`t give it 5 stars because the 4:3 format and extension of each volume. I know the 4:3 is the original format, but i really liked to see an effort to expand the picture relation to 16:9, and of course, more minutes of show per volume.It is a really nice blu ray for every DBZ fan around the world.-"
4,Dbz Kai,It is a good looking blu-ray transfer. It is in the original 4:3 aspect ratio so you will see the side black bars on your tv. The only complaint would be during some fight scenes when the music is playing they have subtitles of the words at the top. Overall a good product.
5,Harmattan is a wonderfully written travelogue,"I came across a review of Harmattan: Wind Across West Africa in a Canadian Literary magazine, subTerrain. The word Harmattan immediately caught my attention. I had not heard this word since I was a child living in Nigeria, West Africa. And to see a book written by a fellow Canadian on this topic was rather surprising. (I suspect it's a rather small club of us who have ventured to this part of the world.) I was so pleased to see it offered on Amazon.com.Harmattan is a wonderfully written travelogue and intimate portrait of one man's visit to an area of the world that is not on the travel adverturers list of ""must see places"". diCintio captures the essence of the people, customs, culture in a most accurate way with honesty and humour. If the paragraph about the beggar girl in Cape Coast does not move you, nothing will. Harmattan was a wonderful return to Africa for me!"
2,purchase with caution,"I recently purchased this player and was excited about its cute design and ability to interface with .wma files. I have had no problems with the radio or the ability of this device to play MP3 audio files--the sound is very good. However, none of the .wma files (files burned from my own CD's) will play on the player. Perhaps this is a mistake that I am making in attempting to download these files, however noone seems to be willing to help me with this problem. I have been extremely frustrated with customer support--I have sent 3 emails to their customer support center and received no replies in over 2 weeks. In addition, no one answers their customer support line--I've stayed on hold in excess of 30 minutes multiple times. Because of this, I am left with returning the player and not recommending it to those who may require any sort of technical support."
5,Best player ever!!!!!!,"this unit rocks, dont pay any attention to the bad reviews, the menu took me all of hmm...2 minutes to learn flat!! the earbuds are certainly good quality, only way to get better ones would be to buy a $40-$50 pair!!!I luv this unit, yeah, so bat will go in two years, by then ill probly want a 200 gig mp3 player not 1.5 anyways so stop whining. even if you dont want one that size then im sure you can get a tiny little 40 gig in 2 years for 100. if you dont want to trade up in two years fine, buy something else that can change the battery, but i say stay with iriver, they make good stuff!!!"
2,"Nice set-up, but quality control is an issue","When I got this is Jan 04, I had to replace it once a month for 4 months various electronic reasons. Hard drive crash, electronic issues, etc. Customer service is a bit of a nightmare. They are a small company here (bigger in Japan), and it shows.I think one of the issues is the player has some conflicts with Macs. While they say they are compatible, sometimes it has issues moving file, and that resulted in two of the four crashed with my system.That said, once you figure out the menu (and I still have some issues there - why does it default into changing the viewing properties instead of changing song menus? You would think that would be the more used option.), it is a nice player. Good for exercising, etc. I mean, do you really need 5 Gig to exercise? Are you running an Ironman?"
1,Poor Quality!,"I received this as a gift in Nov 03, loaded it up and used it four times before putting in a drawer for a month. Then I got it out and the hard drive had failed!! Just popped up with an error message of ""Check HDD"" and that's it. Emailed IRiver tech support, never heard from them. Radio still worked, however, but it showed zero MB available.I could see if I had dropped it or mishandled it. It just died without any reason. It's a piece of crap."
3,Disappointing,"While Keith may be an expert on the original Type 1 Beetle, I felt a bit disappointed by this book. Perhaps I was expecting more, but the book really doesn't go into too much detail, or at least not as much as I was hoping for. I can get more info on the New Beetle from NewBeetle.orgCaveat Emptor"
3,"Not great, not horrible","This is a fun little piece of knowledge from concept to road car. There are a lot of little details mentioned that I wasn't aware of, car specs I didn't know existed, etc. Lots of great color photos for styling ideas and whatnot.I feel like this book falls a bit short if by the term ""handbook"" you associate the term ""guide"". Most things you might want to know about new beetle performance can be found on several websites at not cost. However, if you are a fanatic about your beetle, as many people are, this is a great coffee table book."
5,Riveting video on professional ballet training in Russia,We were given this to view by my daughter's dance teacher when she was 8 years old and probably watched it 5 or 6 times that weekend. For the next two years my daughter wanted to move to Russia to train in this school. A very moving documentary of the intensive selection and training the students at this school went through before moving on to the professional world of dance in Communist Russia.
5,Children of Theater Street,"Bought this for my mom- a devoted Ballet Fan- after her precious VHS copy was lost (and so that she could enjoy this timelass classic on DVD!). She should really be the one writing this review because the film takes her breath away- it's originality, its truth and, of course, the fabulous Grace Kelly as 'herself'.A unique insight into Kirov draws everyone- young and old, and dancers AND athletes. Through the eyes of its students, one learns that, no matter your sport, you can do anything you want, with PASSION, COMMITMENT, HARD WORK and COURAGE.I would have paid 3 times the amount of the DVD- this is really very special."
3,Kirov Ballet,"I enjoyed this peek into the young performers at the Kirov, but I would have liked more. It was a nice surface view, but did not get as deep as I would have hoped. Given the time it was filmed, I guess I should have expected that. Still worth the look."
1,The Children of Theater Street,"I didn't really enjoy this DVD, it was okay, but (...). I thought that The Children of Theater Street was boring!"
5,A true classic,"Though made years ago, the training method hasn't change and is still as valuable as ever. The narration by Grace Kelly is excellent and the children are superb."
4,The children of theatre street,A very interesting look at a students' life at the Kirov showing how they work hard but play hard too. The narration is informative but the narrator speaks throughtout in such a very sad and monotonous voice even when she is talking about the inner joy of dancing that this film is best watched with the sound turned off.
1,Much too old and tedious,"Some of the footage here might be earlier than 1977, it's Soviet Russia, eons before the place opened up. What we see in the footage is much too old to describe the school in the 21st Century. Grace Kelly drones on and on, and at one point quietly informs us that Nureyev, Makarova, and Baryshnikov are never mentioned because they defected. Well, they were rehabilitated years ago, and Grace herself is long gone. It's a humorless, dated documentary, and should be retired to the dust bin. Ignore any recent dates for the video's release, it has nothing to do with 2004. It's 35+ years old, and does not follow up on students who built careers.Although different in purpose, Born To Be Wild, featuring 4 top male dancers from American Ballet Theatre a few years ago is highly entertaining, and I ended up buying some ballet DVD's featuring those guys."
4,America kicks [tush],"A nice overview of the Spanish American War and the subsequent Philippines Insurrection. Earlier summaries of the war do not place much emphasis (if any)on the Philippines Insurrection, but to Marrin's credit, he takes one of the five chapters and discusses it. This did not always show America to be at its best. The other four chapters were pretty standard, except little asides about nicknames (Yellow Press, doughboys, Black Jack Pershing, buffalo soldiers). These little asides were interesting and made the book more informative. For those interested in wanting to understand the war in two hours, this is a worthwhile book."
5,Good Product,My water heater was whinning under load. Using a larger pipe improved throughput of fuel to the tankless water heater.
3,Thought-provoking,"I found the writing in this book just okay. But the subject matter is so interesting and timely that I would recommend ""The Genius Factory"" to most readers. I am shocked that we live in a day and age where building a sperm bank filled with the seed of exceptional men can be considered in any way offensive. I came away from reading this book with a deep respect for Mr. Graham, the founder: a man who actually believed women should have access to intelligent, accomplished donor sperm. I'm not sure that the author, Mr. Plotz, a straight male with healthy offspring of his own, gave sufficient respect to the work that Mr. Graham accomplished through this project. Maybe if he were a 41 year-old lesbian with relatively few choices, he'd have been able to write a more positive book on the subject. I only wish the Bank were still around today..."
5,One of the most unusual books i've ever read,"This book tells the fascinating but true story of an attempt to start a sperm bank using only nobel prize winners. The author takes many detours as he tells the story, discussing eugenics, the trials of donor children trying to work out who they really are and the implications of fertility clinics becoming big business. Some parts of this book were hilarious but there is also some tragic and scary things to think about. The whole book is quality brain food and will definately make you think. Highly recommended."
4,True Life Science Fiction,"Sometimes real life is just plain...odd. Robert Graham, a millionaire, had an idea to protect the human race from genius extinction. He'd open the ""Repository for Germinal Choice"", a sperm bank that would find it's donors among Nobel Prize winners. Women would line up in droves to get some super sperm and begin to produce future scientists, inventors and future leaders of America. The book weaves three sections: the history of Graham and the practice of artificial insemination, the donors, and finally the children that resulted.Plotz manages to inject enough humor in the investigative reporting that the book moves along at quite a clip, feeling like a cross between a B science fiction movie, and a missing persons thriller. Ultimately it's the human element of the parents and children that anchors the story, and gives the overall book it's melancholic heart."
1,A Sensationalized Account without Merit,"My husband is one of the children Mr. Plotz writes about in his book and in his articles on Slate. Unfortunately, Mr. Plotz is much more concerned with creating a sensational story than with fairly or accurately presenting the lives of the people involved in the Repository.My husband's experience with Mr. Plotz demonstrated to us that Mr. Plotz's sole interest is in dramatizing and sensationalizing, even to the point of distortion, the experiences of those he interviews in order to benefit from their stories himself. Please read all his writings with a critical eye - he was neither ""sensitive"" to the ""emotional consequences"" of his journalism in our encounters with him, nor was he respectful of the youth and vulnerability of his subjects in our experience."
2,"Not much ""Hard Science"" I expected more.","I'm only half way through the book, but I'm not sure I can go on. I may return to it later. There is definitely thought provoking material here, but I was looking for more scientific ""meat"". Interesting that when Graham opened up to the sperm bank to any woman, it became a market driven company for the short time it was around and women began selecting for qualities other than Nobel type intelligence, qualities like ""looks"", happiness, athleticism. Darwin strikes again!!!"
3,Lame,"""The Genius Factory"" is the book that should have never been born. I was intrigued by the book because I'm very interested in the ""nature versus nurture"" debate, but it hardly goes into that. It's a book that desperately lacks a story, characters, and even a conflict, and is desperately in search of all three."
1,Rancid,"When I received the order from pastacheese/New York Prime Meats, the two relatively small ice packs had completely melted, and the meat was rancid. I had to dispose of it immediately."
5,A great book! Lovely pictures and tremendous amount of info.,Art of Dress is essential in its information about the evolution of men's and women's clothing from 1750 to 1820. I bought this book in helping me to research the empire style dress of 1790s and early 1800s. It has helped me in my researching and placing me within the world of fashion during the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries. The fashion trends of underdress and overdress as well as hairstyles and clothing are shown in excess in this fabulous book. There are marvelous pictures of royalty of France (Empress Josephine Bonaparte) and her sisters. It is a definite 10 in my book!
5,My Favorite Book!,"I'm a college student studying 18th century costume, and this book is my bible. The text is straightforward and the illustrations are good: every time I read it I learn something new. As for accuracy, I have never read anything by Aileen Ribiero that I have seen, in my research, to be false. This is definitely the best book out there."
3,OK cookie book,"I got this book for my mom's birthday to replace the one she has had since middle school. The only bad thing I had to say was the book wasn't quite in as good of condition as I felt it was told to be in. It is still a great book and a good replacement for her torn, tattered and falling apart one."
2,Disappointed,The rake is very small - I ordered the Large set - and the pan is flimsy. I have bought these in pets stores before and they were sturdy and lasted years. I would not order this item again.
5,Love this rake and scoop!,"This product is PERFECT. We have 4 dogs (one Chihuahua, two Toy Poodles and a Mini Poodle), and this rake and scoop make cleaning up a breeze. Not sure if some of the neg reviews were for bigger dogs, but it seems sturdy enough that even for somewhat bigger jobs than ours it would be great. It is the perfect height and feels very solid."
5,Scoops Poop,"What can I say, it's a pooper scooper. It does it's job, now if I will just do mine and pick up the back yard."
3,Rake Set,I bought a large rake set. The size is perfect. I am disappointed because I thought it was an aluminum handled set but it turned out to be wood. I don't think it will last very long staying outside since I live in Florida and it rains alot.
3,Its a pooper scooper,"It's a pooper scooper. It's of average quality. I'm satisfied, but not blown away. I wish the pan was a little more heavy duty; it flexes easily. One thing I didn't realize is how big the pan is. It looks like you're following after a horse. I'd rather have it be half the size and twice as heavy duty.One complaint I have is that its not very good in freezing weather. Not to get into the gory details, but the rake is not appropriate for picking up business that is frozen to the ground."
2,Not the same as the picture,"The rake is way smaller than shown in the picture used to sell the product! I have a large dog in a large back yard and wanted to large rake as showin in the picture. It works well, but the job could be done faster with a larger rake."
2,Poor quality,"The thing came so poorly assembled that it fell apart the first time it was used. No problem, though, it's not that hard to just put it back together.The real problem was when the handle snapped within the first week during normal use. This might be because it got bounced around during shipping since it was packed in too large of a box with no padding to speak of. Of course, it could also be because the handle is made out of the cheapest, lightest wood mankind has ever known. More likely, it is a combination of the two.Save yourself the hassle and don't buy this product. I did give 2 stars because, after we went to the hardware store and bought a new handle, the rake and scoop work just fine. Nothing to write home about, but gets the job done. This was less of a hassle for us than returning it and finding/ordering a different one, but then again we're at the hardware store quite often so your mileage may vary."
5,Great pet clean-up rake set!,"We bought this set to clean up after our 2 Labradors who make large messes in the backyard!! A set we bought from a local store broke after about a month, so we ordered this and it works great so far...the shovel/tray part is really big and holds a lot of ""stuff"", the rake is amply sized, as well. No complaints so far, it does the job!"
2,This is NOT a general use flashlight!,"I purchased this product because I thought it would be nice to keep my night vision while hiking nature trails at night. However, this light does not satisfactorily light my path, I think the issue is the LED has no lens so it disperses quickly.I have used this light to read my star chart and it has been perfect for that type of use.In my opinion this is a well built, long lasting, night vision preserving reading light, and a good one, but it just doesn't cut it as a general use light."
3,light is not strong enough,"Maybe, because this flash is only using 1 battery. The light is not bright enough."
1,"Well-made, but not very bright","If you want a high-quality flashlight with a red LED, that's quite dim by my experience with other LED flashlights that I own, this one ranks at the bottom of my list of favorites. Granted the red LED is different yet I like my white and blue ones ten times over this one. I do not recommend the purchase of this unless you want to change the color of the LED bulb which I don't know if it's possible."
4,First time father approves,Our child is very relaxed with this cd playing during afternoon naps and when she goes to bed at night. It doesn't take long and she is fast asleep. I think this is one of the best investments my wife and I could have made. The baby sleeps well and therefore we get our RDA. I would definitely purchase this again.
4,Lullaby Review,Item arrived in timely manner however the CD case was cracked. Of course this could have happened during transit. I would purchase from this seller again.
4,Soothing Music,We love the music. It is very soothing to help little ones fall asleep. I have a child who experiences nightmares. I notice when I play the Lullaby Album Vol 1 and 2 she seems less restless and has less complaints of nightmares. This was a great purchase. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because the packaging was poor and the case was cracked in a couple of places. The CD works great but the case is broken. That part was a little disappointing.
3,don't play this in the car,I enjoy mellow music but this is almost sleep inducing. It's actually quite boring and could not classify it as romantic if thinking of using it as any kind of background music. But I imagine it can lull the little ones
5,Happy @ school,I use this fantastic CD during 'Dead Fish' relaxation with 5 & 6 year olds in my class. We do it in the afternoons and it is brilliant. After an active outside playtime it helps bring their energy down a notch or 2. It is also great background for the class when I am wanting a quiet working environment - really helps with focus and keeps the noise in the classroom low. Love it!
1,"Great for raising frightened, docile children","The only ""scriptures"" Dobson seems to know are the Old Testament passages about violence and domination, full of stories about an angry, vengeful god and the primitive people who believed in such things as stoning to death misbehaving children. No wonder Dobson never quotes Christ himself.If the only child-raising tools you think you need are a Bible and a leather belt, then this is the book that will tell you how to use them against your children.However, if you're interested in raising healthy confident children who respond to something more than fear, look elsewhere."
1,Dobson does it again,Another piece of trash to fill the garbage heaps. This is a man who knows nothing about children and even less about love and respect.
1,Child abuse is not Christian,"James Dobson, himself an admitted victim of child abuse, tries to carry on that sadistic, very un-Christian tradition here. Don't bother reading this book -- memorize the Sermon on the Mount instead. Practice the Golden Rule."
2,Disappointing,"I have never written a review before but I had to provide feedback so others know what to expect and aren't disappointed as I was. As a psychologist, I was excited to purchase this and begin teaching my toddlers about emotions. This book is colorful and attractive; for this the author gets 2 stars. I was expecting a book full of emotions with an accompanying picture. However, this book illustrates a few emotions but then confuses thoughts with feelings. If I am teaching my kids about feelings, I should not see statements that begin with ""I feel like..."" (e.g., I feel like playing in the sand"")---that is a thought and not an emotion. There are plenty of emotions to pick from to illustrate in such a book so I don't understand why the author chose to include so many thoughts rather than emotions. Very disappointing...and aggravating. I'll have to find another book to teach my children about emotions."
3,Cute but could be much better!,"This book would be so much better if it showed the various true human feelings, not feeling like ""standing on my head."" I wish I could find a fun book that teaches little ones about all the different feelings we have. I like this book, but it would be better if it showed all the different facial expressions and true feelings..."
4,Great Feelings,"This book was a big hit with my first graders. It showed them that there were ways to let people know what they were feeling, sometimes without saying anything. They now also have an idea of why they are feeling the way they do about things. I loved this book as much as the kids did."
1,Not normal feelings,"I was hoping for a book that covered normal feelings like happy, sad, proud, etc. Instead this book is about off beat feelings like ""I feel like camping with my dog."" I am sure this is an appealing story for little children with all of the bright colors and pictures. However, if you are looking for legitamate feelings this is not the book."
4,Very Nice,"I've heard several discs of keyboard music performed by Sophie Yates, and they are all quite exquisite. This is one of my favorites, a collection of Elizabethan music played on the virginal, a variant of the harpsichord. Well, two different virginals, actually. There are several favorite tunes of the period included, from the Earl of Oxford's March to The Carman's Whistle to Pakington's Pownde, plus fifteen others. All in all, it's an absolute delight: Wonderful music wonderfully played."
5,Best Night Guard I Ever Purchased,"I have been using the product for a year now and love it so much. I've used the sports guards for years and this product is so much better. The bite pads are extremely durable. After a year I still have no wear on the bite pads at all. With the sports guards I would bite through them in about 3 months. I have had trouble keeping the strap in place at night, it tends to slip up on one side. My dentists have always told me I have a small mouth, but I think maybe I need to get the regular size instead of the small profile and this might help my problem. I have never had it slip out of my mouth or slip backwards towards my throat. One thing I recommend that isn't stated in the instructions is to wash it every morning with soap and water before placing it back into the container."
1,Do Not Buy This,I was extremely disappointed in this product. It fell out within minutes of putting it in. The concept just doesn't work. If you are a serious teeth-grinder take a couple hundred dollars and get a mouth guard professionally made for you. You will end up saving money in the long run. I've wasted a lot of money on unsatisfactory OTC night guards.
1,Bad Fit,"I bought this mouth guard hoping to save money not buying a custom made night mouth guard. The SleepRight Adjustable Low-Profile Night Guard didn't fit at all. I took it to my dentist to show her. She changed the adjustment, too, just as I had done, and she saw it didn't fit either. It was way too big, and the band that goes across the lower front teeth made my lower lip stick way out! She took an impression of my lower teeth and ordered a custom mouth guard which came in 2 days. I used it last night. It fits perfectly, and as my insurance didn't cover this cost ($286) I was only charged $99."
4,I like it...,"I'm pretty happy with this. I've tried the ""full-mouth"" ones that cover both upper and lower teeth, but they always choked me in the middle of the night since I tend to breath through my mouth. This one has a strap-like thing that lays over the bottom teeth and therefore presents no choking hazard when the mouth is open. Plus, it tastes good!"
3,Not always effective,"I really have a problem grinding my teeth in my sleep, mostly when I'm under any kind of stress. With this product I can sometimes solve this issue. I say sometimes because some of the time it stays put and some of the time it just falls off in my sleep. I have to consciously keep it in my mouth during the night."
2,A bit uncomfortable,"I have a smallish mouth, and no matter how I adjust this mouth guard, I can't get it too be comfortable and can't close my mouth with it in. The bits on the sides are just too much. Nice materials, however: flexible, comfortable texture."
3,"Good idea and design, but just not quite there.","I've tried all the sizes available for these SleepRight night guards and it really came down to the bite pads being too thick. Don't get me wrong, the design and materials used seem of high quality, but even after a month - I was not used to this product in all the different sizes. I would wake up with cuts in my mouth (the bite pads have a harder plastic pivot) and a sore jaw from keeping it open at a certain angle (unanimous with all sizes). I think the design can use a little more refinement and it may be very good one day. I switched over to the Dentek ""copies"" and they actually work better for me. They come in packs of 2 for the price of 1 of these as well (just make sure you get the ones that have the blue bite pads). You can give it a try and may have success with this one.. but not for me."
4,decent mouth guard,This is the first mouth guard I have ever owned. I selected the low profile instead of the regular one thinking it would be less bulky in mouth and therefore more comfortable. I was wrong. I tried the regular one after and it fit me more confortable. The only difference I noticed between the regular and low profile is that the regular one has higher walls on the side to keep the guard from caving into your mouth. Only consider buying the low profile if you have a very small mouth.
2,SleepRight,"I returned this product a few weeks after receiving it. It moved around in my mouth too much during the night, it just didn't stay in place. It is very flexible and has a nice mint taste to it. Adjusts easily, but the openings where you can adjust it kept rubbing on my inner cheek and caused a sore."
2,careful,"This guard fits fine, and I didn't even feel like I had a mouthguard in. But it has three pieces (making it adjustable) and can come apart, as it did one night when I was asleep. Luckily, something in my mind told me to wake up as one of the small plastic pieces rested on the back side of my tongue. The thought of choking on one of the pieces while asleep scared me, and I haven't put it in since."
3,Great at first then progressively worse,"I really liked this product at first. It worked great for about three months then I bought another one. After a couple months with that one my gums began to hurt more and more as the night guard was rubbing against them. I tried trimming down all the sides which only helped slightly. I also noticed that my teeth would be horribly unaligned when I woke up.I just ordered a different guard, the Dentek Comfort Fit Guard, maybe that one will work out better..."
3,OK,This must be a new type because I have had the very same one before and it fit my mouth so much better. The bite wings are alot smaller than they used to be.
2,A cheaper way to cope with bruxism if your insurance won't cover a bite splint.,"I appreciate that this comes in the ""low profile"" size--otherwise, I would have had no choice but to have one custom made. I was curious about it being of the ""cinnamon"" variety. I assumed it meant that it tasted like cinnamon, but I wondered how (with daily washing & wear) it could retain the surely artificial flavor. . . It's actually very lightly cinnamon *scented*, and you don't really notice it at all when you're wearing it (taste or smell). It's pretty comfortable to wear.Fast forward to a couple years later:This guard would sometimes wind up out of place at night. Sometimes, I'd wake up to find myself reflexively chewing on it. I wound up getting a bite plate made at my dentist's office, and it's 1000 times better--the fit conforms perfectly, and it's comfortable & easy to clean."
4,Genuine LAMY ballpoint refill.,"MyLamy Noto Orange Ballpoint Pen - L282OEhas become my favorite pen, but the refill died after only limited use. It's my first Lamy pen so I'm not sure if that's expected for this brand, if I got an old pen, or just had some bad luck.Anyway, the pen uses this non-standard refill. After using the refill for about a week so far, so good. It writes well, has nice black ink, and fits my pen properly. I'll update if this replacement refill also leads a short life. Comes on a blister card. Made in Germany.Update 3.8.2012: Well, the refill started acting up yesterday, and today it seems to be nearly dry. That means the refill lasted about four months. I really like my Lamy Noto pen, but it seems like the refills don't last very long. I'm buying another, so I'll update this review with any news."
5,This Is a supplement to an older DVD,"I do not own this DVD or any other Superman DVD. A co-worker of mine has ""Max Fleischers Superman"" on DVD. this was release several years ago. It contains all the episodes that do not appear on ""The Lost Episodes"". TLE was produced to finish the series for those owning the older DVD. Do not buy both this and the complete set as recommended by Borders/amazon.com If you don't have the old release, you won't nead TLE. Just get the complete DVD."
4,This is a great watch!!!,"I bought this video, watched it and enjoyed it. I have to agree with others being that the sound isn't all too great but one can't expect perfection with a 1940's cartoon. If you enjoy early 20th century cartoons, you'll enjoy this. I gave it -1 star because of the sound but I took that into account when I purchased it. However, it would be great if the sound was cleared up, even though it has been with this collection. I would recommend buying it if you're a Superman fan. There was alot of work put into these short cartoons on the tape; art work that you don't see anymore."
3,Only for Nostalgia,"Comparing these episodes to new animation is like comparing a bicycle to a space shuttle. Obviously, these cartoons are not as good as todays', say Titan AE or Batman: The animated series. But comparing this to their contemporaries, this is really fantastic.So if you are a Superman fan, but not an animation fan, get this. It's like getting a piece of history.Too bad, I got this DVD before the Complete Episode series came out. Check out the other DVD before buying this one. You'll get more of the same price."
5,work great hold up well needs fit pack to function,"This is a portion of the Thule system. You need load bars, a fit kit, and a foot pack. This foot pack includes the lock cap (not the locks) and the load bar end caps."
3,Covers are plastic... cheap.,The Foot Pack works just fine but the plastic covers were disappointing. Two of them cracked while tying up my kayaks. They are basically for aesthetics so it isn't a big deal but they are very flimsy and will break if you actually use your rack.
2,Unacceptably Difficult to Install,"Be warned that if you have a 2004-2007 style Toyota Prius, this is a nightmare to install. There are multiple steps that simply are impossible to perform without improvising. Unless you are extremely handy or can have this professionally installed, I would avoid this for a Prius. I did finally get mine successfully installed, but it took 3 days and lots of problem solving when the steps in the instructions were either unclear or physically impossible. What a nightmare.Update: it's one season later, and I thought it might be easier to re-install than it was to initially install. Wrong. Still a nightmare. I contacted Thule Support for help, and their response was to send me a picture of a 2010 Prius with one installed to prove that it can be done. Not too helpful. The skis went in the hatchback for the first trip up this season."
1,"Feet Are Fine, Beware the Fit Kits","The Thule 400 feet are great if you can find a fit kit that works. But be very careful of Thule Fit Kits. At least one of them does not fit. I bought the 2171 fit kit for my 2006 Honda Civic. It does NOT fit! Thule will not stand behind their products and let me return the kit. I have another Honda and the kit for that one fits great. So, try and find a review of the specific kit you want to buy before you buy it. Do NOT buy the 2171 kit expecting it to fit a 2006 Honda Civic. IT DOES NOT FIT."
1,Don't waste your time & money,"Now the VW factory rack accessory for $800 seems inexpensive in comparison--it's guaranteed to work.If you have the rectangular (cross section) bar that is supposed to work with this, don't waste your time. It may not fit properly. It was a very tight squeeze and I inched...more like millemetered along and finally gave up. I wasted two hours the night before my ski trip. I ordered the kit in November, but have been driving the other two cars which had the old bar and attachment. I have packaged all the parts and I am sending it back to get a refund. In the meantime, the trusty VW van works just fine WITHOUT a ski rack.Nice rack...NOT."
4,A story for the heart,"No mattter how much you love your mother, this will help you to appreciate her more. my family is not chinese, nor are we immigrants, however, after reading this book, I learned to appreciate the sacrifices my mother made in her life to better mine.I am currently trying to read The Joy-Luck Club right now, but it is nowhere near as good or as fast of a read. Many people who read the book with me came to the same conclusion that I did. This book is not about the outcome, it is about the jouney. The road we take in life determines the kind of person we will become."
4,Heartbreaking family story,"Just when you thought that nothing can match 'Lucky Joy Club's' powerful story plot, Amy Tam comes and suprises you with beautiful and sad story about woman with a lot of courage and determination. Do not miss this wonderful read."
4,Kitchen God's wife a tale of a woman's hardships,This is one of Amy Tan's better works. This book seemed to relay to the reader of the hardships that a women went through prior to world war 2. It also distinguished the cultural differences between two very different generations. It allowed the reader to identify with the culture and the relationships between family. This book is recomended for those interested in chinese culture and why the older generation is different from present chinese americans.
3,Compelling; Chinese culture unfolded,The KITCHEN GOD'S WIFE is an epic tale that will be remembered history as well as the evolution of a traditional Chinese-American dealing with inner-family tragedies. Throughout the story Tan speaks of her own life and her own inner struggles through Winnie sruggling to develop a relationship with Pearl. This book also deals with the magic and superstition that is only found in Chinese culture. Tan is a master storyteller
1,Defiinitely just fiction.,As I get older I find Amy Tan's works are really just fiction. I think it is sad that her books make up some of the curriculum of Asian American studies and also histories of immigrant experiences. Now we have a new generation of students who think this is what is normal in the Asian communities. So sad.... The depiction of Asian men is that they are all bad people or deadbeats. Asian women are just supposed to take it until they can't take anymore. There also seems to be this sense that the women all need a savior in their lives to make the pain go away. So not true... My grandmother was orphaned during WW2. Her two brothers were killed because they were bringing home sweet potatoes that they bought by selling some family furniture. I remember her as a lady that can and will face anything head on and tell it like it is. So not like the ladies in Amy Tan's novels.
3,My first Amy Tan read,"I really enjoyed this book but my Book Club members often said, ""This wasn't like Bonesetter's Daughter."" True, Bonesetter's Daughter is great, but I still enjoyed this insight into Chinese culture and the mother-daughter relationship was fun to be a part of. The first 100 pages are a littel slow to start."
2,unrealistic books aren't moving in my opinion,"I bought this book to read for school because I had read all of the wonderful reviews and I thought I would like it. The problem with Tan's book is 1) it is unrealistic 2) it is a formula book. Tan writes as if she is planning for a movie- but its not a movie, its a book. The plot follows a mother and a daughter (Pearl and Winnie-Louie) and the feelings each has about particular secrets they are keeping from one another. Winnie decides to tell Pearl that her real father isn't who she thinks he is and blah, blah, blah..it goes on for pages! For maybe 250 pages or more she tells a much too detailed account of EVERY SINGLE THING that has ever happened to her and you never hear one remark from Pearl until she's completely finish. It was terrible."
2,Tan shouldn't have paralleled her book to the Kitchen Gods.,"Because the Kitchen God King was not a misogynist. If you read the actual fairy tale there is no hint of abuse on the Kitchen God Queen. The Kitchen King never raped or beated the Kitchen Queen. If you see many illustrations of the Kitchen King and Kitchen Queen in Chinese literature, they are always together. And the Kitchen Queen is honored because she is the Kitchen King's wife. And the Kitchen King is honored because he is the Kitchen Queen's husband. So, Wen Fu doesn't even come close as a comparison to the Kitchen King! Other than that, the only good this novel can do is help strengthen feminist causes (although Tan does it in spite of Chinese culture). But, it won't help Asian causes at all."
4,A theme that will remain in your heart,"This is one of the best book I've ever read. Amy Tan is my favorite aurthor and I've read every about a secret between a mother-daughter. It intervenes both of their relationship after book she published. The Kitchen God's Wife is Winnie told Pearl the truth. A book that went back to WWII. A book with many interactions, vivid description, and a Chinese culture everyone can learn about. There are many characters in this book with different charactersitic. Amy Tan tries to put life into every character, and I think it was well done! So - pick up this book and start reading - because you wont be dissappointed!"
5,Love Amy Tan,Very interesting book. I just could not put it down. It is Amy Tan's usual story of mother and daughter interactions and psychology. Her style is very simple and very close to the way my Chinese friends interact.
3,"Setting is real, characters are paper.","I love the story telling style and the description of the setting, sights, and smells in an era fraught with conflict. That said, some of the characters could use a little rounding up. Okay, a lot of rounding up. Wen Fu, the abusive husband, is ridiculously evil. Beating an infant? Raping servant girls? Making his wife beg on her knees for mercy anytime she displeases him? He's reckless and violent, but the whole time this character floats along well-liked and unchecked by society. I don't buy it. Then we have the love-at-first-sight knight in shining armor and the not-as-smart-as-she-thinks-she-is best friend, both equally flat. It makes the plot repetitious; you'll aways know what they'll do and how they will react.I think the cultural setting, (the war, the communists, China to America) is what carries the novel, not the characters. It's worth the read, but be prepared to speed read through some parts."
5,SOO I CRY ON THE NEW.YORK SUBWAY,"WOW. This is the 3rd time I have read this book, and I just start weeping. I work on Broadway, ( yes I am a performer)and this book is wonderful. I'm from the old country ( England) and I truly bloody well connect with all the people in her novels. I'm young; and Amy is me mentor. When I remember what I've gone through in me wee life, I remember charachters in her books that I can identify with ( JOY LUCK CLUB included) and then I feel I can ""CARRY ON' Thanks ever soo much . You are a true genius, Cheers . A faithful and Loyal follower NATA$HA V."
5,urgent,i read that someone has written a review relating hundred secret sences and the kitchen god's wife. If u happen to read this pls send the review to my e-mail add: alfaspin@hotmail.com
3,This was a slow-paced novel with no major conflict,"The Kitchen God's Wife was an uninteresting book about Chinese traditions and superstitions. There was no major conflict but instead series of minor struggles. An example of a minor struggle was Pearl's anxiety of telling her mother about her disease. This is not even resolved until the end of the book and by then we had already forgotten about it. The switch in the narrators at the beginning was a little confusing. During the part when Hulan and Winnie are traveling during the war there is too much confusion about where they are going and where they have just been. The plot is also a little slow around this point. The end of the story, when Winnie buys Pearl the staue, did not really tie into the rest of the novel."
1,Where is the value in this novel?,"I cannot understand how this novel can carry so much acclaim. The situations lack universiality and even the limited population that can relate will be distracted by the poor organization and surreal circumstances. Amy Tan needs to reevaluate what she is attempting to do with her work: Are you just going to be an asian, supermarket novelist? I think that it is becoming redundant and increasingly limited."
2,Roxanne,"I enjoyed the Joy Luck Club so I assumed I would enjoy this one as well. This book is merely a continuation of the Joy Luck Club-same story of mother and daughter. Identical, where each one complains about their life, except, this time it got so tedious as the mother's story went on endlessly, repeating the same thing over and over again. I finally gave up about two thirds into it. I was surprised that she hadn't come up with a fresh idea, and felt the need to continue with the mother-daughter thing."
2,"NOT AS GOOD AS ""JOY LUCK"".","It starts great, but then it starts to linger off and it just doesn't have the same ""hold"" as ""joy luck"" did. I don't want the same story as ""joy luck"" but I wanted a little more interesting characters. And it seems the story is repeated constantly regarding the characters, ""Wen Fu"" and ""Winnie Louie"" their awful marriage. A little disappointing."
2,A Disappointing Tome,"It was with great anticipation that I picked up this book, having read the author's first novel. It was a great disappointment. An overlong story, written as if the writer were being paid by the word. The character as victim becomes quite tedious and so, unfortunately, is this over-rated book."
3,It was a interesting book that kept my attention.,A good story of the trials and tribulations of a woman life story of struggles through a life of secrets and lies. It teaches a good lesson about beign truthfull to the people who are most important in your life. Winnie's struggle from her childhood to adulthood shows how being strong and following what you believe in will eventually become a reality.
4,One of the greatest books a child can be forced to read!,"I am a 14 year old girl who was forced to read this book for school. I want everyone to know that ""you should not judge a book by its cover."" I didn't like the title of this book before I began reading it, however once into the book I learned that, dispite the title, it was a wonderfully emotional story. I felt that I could relate to Winnie when she was a shy and secretivie child, I think the same thoughts as a growing woman, and I pity her for going through such a terrible life. The character of Winnie was a very bright woman and I envy her courage. I pray that I don't have to go through such terrifing experiences as she did. Although forcing a child to read a book discourages them, I believe my school picked a winner with this book. It is the one of the best books a child can be forced to read!"
4,This Book was one of the few books I've liked in high school,I really enjoyed reading this book because not only did Amy Tans writting capture me completely but the story seemed very realistic and alive. I loved it.
4,It's the characterization that gets me,"One thing I love is when a character or cast of characters captivate me. I can see them, I can hear them and I can sympathize with them. Amy Tan always produces this for me. As I understand it, this novel was loosely based on Amy's mother's life, making it all the more interesting and intriguing. I've read it at least 5 times and come away with something new and different with each reading."
5,You must read this book,"I was getting tired of reading books like Anne Frank's Diary. All those books on the Holocaust are all the same, as far as I'm concerned. This book explained wonderfully what China was like during World War II. I like how it points out all the little details in life. Being Chinese-American myself, I can totally relate to this book. I know my parents can act very strange sometimes because they are used to Chinese customs. This book points that out in a very touching way."
3,Good,"This is an interesting book. I learned quite a bit about China's history, although insight into culture appears to be tainted. The characters appear so full-blown and over exaggerated that it felt more like I was reading a Batman comic than a genuine human events story. Her writing style is clear, but it is too cute. Short, cute little phrases, and cute little sayings. Like she's been living on a cream puff for thirty years."
5,A great read!,"I loved this book, it is one of my all-time favorites. It is a gripping story of a daughter who does not know her mother at all until her mother tells her the harrowing story of her early life in China. Also, the mother-daughter theme is universal. Don't miss this book!"
2,The Kitchen God's Wife,I am a huge Amy Tan fan; this particular book is not one of her best but enjoyable none-the-less.- Erika W. Estes
4,Great Service!,The book was in the condition it said it was in and it was a great price! The delivery was super fast and even arrived before the date anticipated.
4,The kitchen God's wife,"This was a GREAT book. Beautifully written. It has such GREAT insight into the Chinese culture and relates the experiences of war torn China from a very real, very raw, very personal perspective."
4,A very enjoyable reading,"If you want to put your feet up and read a good book, I would strongly recommend Amy Tan's The Kitchen God's Wife. She is a masterful storyteller and makes her characters come to life. This book takes you to a far away land and culture with a different set of rules and values, and one cannot wait to know how it all ends."
4,Lovely story,"I have read all books by Amy Tan and I can't decide which one I like best. They're simply beautiful; the stories are as glittery and fascinating as a Chinese silk gown and the characters are so real I can hardly believe they don't exist. I felt very dissapointed abut the fact that Winnie's horrid jerk of a husband wasn't punished as he deserved, but overall this is an excellent book."
5,My favorite tearjerker novel,"For some reason, I liked this novel the most out of all the Amy Tan novels I've read (I've only read two others: The Joy Luck Club and The Hundred Secret Senses). I actually read this novel about two years ago, but it still has lasting impressions on me. Tan brought me to tears quite a few times in Winnie's life, which did not happen for some odd reason during the reading of The Joy Luck Club. Tan kept me spellbound for the last half of this book. I loved the sweetness of Winnie's second husband. I wasn't as enthralled about Pearl's story, but their stories together made for well-balanced view of their relationship."
3,"""Joy Luck Club""-light","I was very disappointed by this novel. After having read ""The Joy Luck Club"", I sought out other Tan novels. I expected there to be some similarities between the books, but I didn't expect this book to be a duller version of ""The Joy Luck Club.""Tan does sensitively explore the relationships we have with our families, particularly mothers and daughters. I know that she has received criticism for her perceived less-than-flattering portrayal of Asian and Asian American men. I don't particularly agree with this point of view.Nevertheless, despite Tan's clear gifts for storytelling and creating families with whom we all fell a connection, this novel just falls far short of the magic and pathos of her much greater achievement, ""The Joy Luck Club."""
2,Not compatible with the Wii,I assumed that since it had a gamecube connector that it would be compatible with the Wii. It is not.
2,disappointed,"I wish I had read the reviews not just the specs before buying. I also figured it would work on the Wii because of the gamecube adapter, it doesn't.Live and learn.I have a xbox, ps2, & Wii. Would have been a great deal for the price if it worked for using the other controllers on my Wii( i.e. ps2 guitar for guitar hero aerosmith on the Wii system would have ROCKED!.) Maybe future versions of this product will have this feature."
3,I love these toys they are simply fabulous,Oh my god! I love these little things. I wish their clothes coome in my size! I think they are way better then barbie's! I mean Bratz are well proportioned accept for thier heads but i think that's because it makes it easier for younger kids to see their faces. And as for durability they are excellent(unless of course your younger sibling decides to bite their heads off!)All in all i think they are great accept for the fact that you have to buy the same doll fifteeb times over to get all the fab clothes!
5,Fun,"These Bratz are the most prettest Bratz EVER! They even look like they're sleepy a little bit! Cloe is sooo pretty!!I don't understand- WHY don't parents think these aren't appropriate for they're LITTLE girlz?????? Hmmm....Cause ya'll know Bratz are 90% appropriate for kids..Maybe, like ages 7+ would be better..Who knows....Ya and maybe the lil' kids would enjoy My Scene more...anyways...thanks for reading and Happy Holidayz!!!!"
