2,What a Waste!,"I was so looking forward to reading this book while on holiday. I read a glowing review at my nail shop in a People magazine (I should have known!), and bought it to bring to New Mexico. I love London, and did appreciate reading all about the shops, neighborhoods and tube stations, but that was about it! This character really does have a problem that could have been dealt with in a more humorous and realistic manner, but instead we are treated to a compulsive personality that never truly gets clarity. There are also some parts of the story that don't get wound up at the end, so frustrating! Don't waste your time (especially your vacation time!) on this borer, instead read or reread something by David Sedaris. Cheers!"
1,Silly and Boring,"I wish I hadn't wasted $10 on this book. It was silly and boring. Other critics are right - it reads like a book published by a fashion magazine or something, with way too many detailed descriptions of retail items for sale. It almost felt like someone was trying to entice me into going out to purchase some of the items so much time was wasted on describing in intimate detail.I particularly dislike the book from a political viewpoint: it makes light of a very, very serious problem in the US - people living way beyond their means. The subject could have been dealt with in a comedic manner without making it seem as though we are all SUPPOSED to be paying off one credit card with another, buying things we don't need, and being wasteful.Thumbs down on this book. Don't waste your money or your time."
3,good lord she's flaky,"Yes, I grew tired quickly of her whining and panicking. Good thing this is a work of fiction. Sadly, I'm guessing there are actually REAL people out there like this."
2,definatly a dissapointment,"I must admit that I'm a snob for these ""queen for a day"" type books. They're quick and enjoyable. This story was a fairytale, a cute plot, kept me reading (thus the two stars). However, the end was rushed and not thought out well. So she gets a new job and her life turns around. Does she just forget about her old job and work? There's no conclusion. She literally dumps her past, and pays it away. After dragging on about this woman's shopping disease and all of the problems it causes, to have it wrap up so swiftly and unthoughtfully is a waste to this potentially sweet story."
3,decent enough,"though i found Rebecca Bloomwood's pattern of make a resolution, not stick to it, and go further into debt annoying, i couldn't put this book down. i thought rebecca was witty, and the book is classic chick lit. if you can overlook rebecca's annoying personality at first, in the end you will really grow to like her."
5,Light and Entertaining!,"If you are into light & comic reading, this is a must! This one is so entertaining & funny .. and you will find yourself laughing in Becky's antics and bloppers. She indeed reminds me of Bridget Jones and i would definitely love to see this made into a movie.. with exactly Renee Zellweger as Becky."
5,One of the best books I've ever read!,"When one of my friends recommended Confessions of a Shopaholic to me, it took me a while to get my but to the book store and buy it. I'm definatly not someone who likes to read. But when I started reading it, I was immediatly hooked. I could totally relate!!!! I loved how Sophie Kinsella talked about the clothes and made it seem like Becky was real! I mean, which girl can't relate to Becky Bloomwood in some way. Although it's not really suspensful, Sophie Kinsella has you hooked. I couldn't stop reading it.Another thing I liked about this book, is that there are not many like it. How many authors would base a book on someone who loves to shop. This book is hilariously funny and I recommend it to any shopaholic."
3,what's with the inane brit lit out these days?,"The good news: easy reading, good for the beach, goes very fast, and somehow, you want to finish (and even read the other books). The bad news: inane characters, inane plot, inane writing style. Suddenly the market seems flooded with books about British women who are supposed to be loveable, if not quite competent. But the main character here has no redeeming features whatsoever. Instead of being delightfully ditzy, she is ridiculous, and makes a bad name for women everywhere. And the biggest question: why on earth does she attract this particular accomplished, together man? I don't get it."
3,Very light reading....,"Definitely a page-turner from mid-book on, towards the end I suppose I really wanted to find out what was going to happen. The only problem I had was with Becky's ""compulsive lying"" behaviour, it got way ridiculous and totally unrealistic and she got very annoying.All in all, I recommend the book...Also, I do like Sophie Kinsella's writing style, it is clever and funny."
1,Predictable - A Waste of Money and Time,"This book is pure, fluffy chick lit. I figured that going in, but I was looking forward to a little junk food for my brain. I thought this book was very similar to Bridgette Jones' Diary, but not nearly as good. Most chick lit centers on a slightly neurotic female character that the reader grows to love despite her flaws. I didn't feel the least bit sympathetic to Rebecca Bloomwood. The current recession could have something to do with why I had no sympathy for someone who can't control her spending and lies to cover it up. The book is full of lots of references to designer clothing and chic London shops. Other than that, the plot is extremely predictable and left me feeling like I'd wasted the $8 that I spent on buying the book."
5,Great read,"I absolutely fell in love with the main character. The book was funny and I couldn't put it down. When I finished it was on to the next in the series. I love Sophie Kinsella, a great series."
5,Great Book to Read,"After much consideration of everyone's reviews and obsession, I decided to read the Shopaholic Series. This first book was great. It was easy to read and I found it to be very enjoyable so much that I refered this book to a friend. I haven't read the Bridgette Jones' Diary so I can't comment if it's a total rip off of it, which I read from another review. Quite honestly, I found the characters to be very relateable and easy to remember. Becky was someone that everyone could relate to. She was very human and I enjoyed seeing how she got herself in and out of trouble. After reading this book, I was an instant fan of Sophie Kinesella. I did read the second book of the series and you'll have to see what I thought about that."
1,Confessions of an Idiotic Shopaholic!,"I really hate slamming books, really I do. This book is the typical chick-lit that I've grown to love, and to be fair, it's a quick read.But, my praise stops there.The main character of this book, Rebecca Bloomwood, is the most annoying, daft, and ridiculous character I have ever had the misfortune to read about. I understand that she's a ""shopaholic"", but I've had quite a few friends who fell into that catagory that were never in danger of being as simple-minded and arrogant as Rebecca.Every time I put this book down, I find myself angry. My forehead is wrinkled, and I'm snapping at my innocent boyfriend.Why?I'll give you a hint: It isn't because I'm upset at having to put the book down!All I can tell you is that unless you, yourself, are ignorant, incredibly stupid, deceitful, materialistic, dishonest, and rude...you will find nothing to associate with in Becky Bloomwood."
1,I don't get it.,"As I have lately been enjoying the chick lit genre, I decided to give this book a try. It sounded silly, but I figured if Kinsella was able to follow it up with several more Shopaholic books, she must be on to something. I finished this book 2 weeks ago, and I'm still trying to figure out why, exactly, this book is such a hit. I found Becky very hard to relate to. Yes, like many 20something women, I've had credit card issues. But Becky's pathological lying to her family, friends, and herself, wasn't amusing. There were so many times in this book where I realized that a situation was supposed to be funny, but it instead just made me a little bit sick to my stomach. I would have greatly enjoyed the fairy tale ending had it happened to any other character, but I couldn't root for Becky. She didn't deserve it."
5,It Was Like Reading My Diary,"It was scary! I thought this book would be likehearted entertainment because I of course had put all of my financial missteps behind and could laugh at the good days of dodging creditors. But within ten pages I felt mighty uncomfortable but highly entertained because no matter how bad her mistakes you could always empathize! Easy read with great characters! Shopaholic Takes Manhattan wasn't as good but still entertaining (after a couple of chapters you do begin to loss patience, get a grip for crying out loud!)"
5,Funny from the first word,"I bought this book on a whim, and then I read it over and over and over. As a new ""grown-up"" (a few years out of college and swimming in credit card debt), I found this book to be a hilarious release. While I think it may encourage cc spending, I still laugh all the way to the creditors."
4,As delicious a confection as the first,"All 3 shopaholic books are great--Becky Bloomwood continues to deny reality while living with really zany relatives and friends, but turns out all right in the end. The endings all have a twist in them and it's worth turning the page just to find out how bad things have gotten.You do have to suspend your sense of reality though. Becky's financial troubles are novel enough to be amusing in book 1, but by book 2 you're wondering why she hasn't cut back yet.But anyone who has taken a deep breath and spent a fortune on something-you-simply-must-have and then left it to collect dust afterward will be able to identify with her."
4,Very Fun Read,"This book isn't going to change your outlook on life or anything, but it's a very entertaining read. Although I'm not this bad, I heard some of my over-spending problems echoed in hers! The heroine is also very endearing."
3,Great read,Enjoyed reading this book. This girl went through so much to learn from her mistakes. I bet this happens in real life.
2,Cheesy,"Quick read, pretty cheesy. Wasn't the worst I've ever read, but there's definitely no thinking involved to understand the plot."
5,Love Shopaholic!,"I found Confessions to be very enjoyable. I laughed out loud and had a few people glance over at me. I thought this book was much better than the movie. If you liked the movie, I suggest you read the book. Rebecca is a hilarious, realistic character that reminded me of a friend (I could identify with her, too). Any woman who likes to shop would enjoy this book... you all know the feeling you get when you first walk into your favorite store and realize there's a sale!! Kinsella captures it perfectly and will have you giggling. I definitely recommend this book. I have read takes Manhattan (not as great as the first, but good) and I am on my way to reading the whole series."
4,A good fun read,"In the tradition of ""Bridget Jones' Diary"", ""Confessions of a Shopaholic"" doesn't disappoint. Rebecca, a financial journalist, is experiencing financial turmoil of her own, having maxed out her credit cards and unable to stop spending. Add in a romance complete with crossed signals, and a personal revelation at the end, this book is fun from beginning to end. Rebecca is rather self-indulgant and annoying, but she quickly endears herself to the reader. Recommended reading for snuggling in front of the fire or toasting on the beach or by the pool. :-)"
4,Mucho Fun.,"Very enjoyable chick-lit. Rebecca has a terrible shopping problem (I almost started yelling at her via the pages.) which has gotten her deeper and deeper into debt. It's a very funny book with several laugh out loud moments. There is a touch of romance, but that isn't the focus of the book, its about Rebecca finding a passion in her life other than shopping. It doesn't have the touch of trash that many chick-lit types have.I espeicially loved her realationship with her room mate.Totally awesome for a summer beach read or the like."
3,Mall Fluff,At least there's some laughs at the primeval force that sends women shopping when they've run out of chocolate following relationship struggles. Kinsella has a good light touch for the details and will no doubt stretch this one-line satire into several books that will make window shopping a suburban cult.
3,Light Fun Read,"I laughed out loud at this book (although thats not that surprising from me) and most of the antics of Becky were pretty funny. However it's hard to actually care about a character who just doesn't learn her lesson and continues to lie to everyone around her. She's likeable enough in her funny ways of rationalizing everything and you want her to win in the end but it'd be nice if she learned a few things form her mistakes. I liked ""Can you Keep a Secret?"" better."
5,I will read whatever this woman writes...,"As soon as a i bought this book. i continued to buy every other book by sophie kinsella. she thinks just like me. and becky the heroin is hilarious. She always finds some reason to buy some...thing. And just to let you guys know, the third one is the absolute best! sigh... just read it and youll know why. i mean the wedding is sooo amazing and the last bit is the best. In Confessions she got me hooked. and i started to miss the character im soo glad she wrote the 5th one. but too bad we have to wait so long until i think september till it comes out."
5,"~Like Sex and the City, with better shoes and in London~","Ok, yes, I'm ready to admit it. I, Torysmama, am addicted to British ""Singleton Ficton"". Now, I'm not talking ""Bridget Jones"" here. This is BETTER than Bridget Jones. I'm talking ""roll on the floor"" better than Bridget...a ""fashion tatse to die for"" better than Bridget. I completed this fabulous work of fiction in one sitting and laughed through the entire novel and immediately jumped on Amazon to see if the author had more...give me more, I thought, but sadly, this is her first novel. She must write another. You will not regret reading this book, in fact, you will love it. The protagonist of the story, Rebecca, is every credit card company's nightmare. Let's just say that she's never met a sale that she didn't like and she's met lots of shoes that she does! Her motto should be, ""If it's on sale, then I'm really saving money!"" In a time where we're all up to up eyeballs in debt, this is the book for us!"
3,"Unbelieveable character, but great shopping","I definitely could identify with the thrill Becky got from a sign that said ""Sale"" or the sight of carrier bags from her favorite stores. However, as much as I tried to like Becky, I really couldn't. She is self-centered, beyond materialistic, thoughtless, and immature. I don't know if Kinsella wanted to paint a picture that all ""shop-aholics"" are this way, but somehow I don't think they are. Becky is an unbelievable character because in real life there would be no way that she would be able to avoid dealing with her mounting financial debts. I found myself irritated that everything just worked out for her--she didn't deserve it. Furthermore, what in the world would someone like Luke Brandon see in her? However, it was an easy interesting read (read it in an evening), and the minor characters were pretty well-written."
3,"It had its moments, but....","Overall, this book was something of a disappointment! To give credit where credit is due, Ms Kinsella did a wonderful job in painting her main character, Rebecca, as a shopaholic. The fixes Rebecca finds herself in, as well as the ""creative"" solutions she takes to get herself out of those situations, range from pathetic to hilarious. That said, Rebecca Bloomwood is not a sympathetic character. While we might all be able to identify with aspects of her personality, she was so self-absorbed, especially in relation to the few friends she had, that it was difficult to remain involved with Rebecca, or even to root for her. Even when she does do something selfless, the effects of that act on her character are short lived. The result, needless to say, does not endear the main character to reader. Finally, this book would have been a much better read if Rebecca's love life had been better developed. As it is written, it seems not only implausible, but disingenuous."
4,"A light, super fun read !!","Rebecca is a woman after my own heart. Never pass a SALE sign, always justify the purchase, and when all else fails SHOP SHOP SHOP. When you pick up this book be prepared for the first 100 pages or so of detailed shopping. For me it was fun, but my sister found this a bit annoying. Then the money making antics come in, sadly I believe many of us can relate to these hilarious get rich quick desperate measures. And I am happy to report our sweet rebecca learns and grows and comes out winning in many ways, with even a twist of romance thrown in to add to the fun. I loved this book, and never regretted buying it, it is one I'll probably pull out most summers and enjoy again. Written in true English humor and form (much like Bridget Jones, but for me more enjoyable)this is a light read and a good time. If you love shopping, shop this one right into your bag!"
3,Struggled to finish the book,"The first two thirds of the book is almost unbearable - it shouldn't take that long to describe a person who lives such lies and absurdity. Annoying!!!! Some nice twists at the end, though."
3,ho hum fun,"I WISH THIS BOOK had more shopping involved. There were some boring parts like when she visits her parents (yawn). I was looking forward to a book about uncontrollable shopping but it was a book more about jobs, roomates, parents, social and love life and it's these things that drive her to be a shopaholic. NOT ENOUGH FASHION :(. But I read it twice and the second time around I laughed out loud at the character she is adorable once u know her. I also didn't like the fact that the scene is in LONDON where I can't relate :(. Wish it took place HERE in the U. S. daym."
4,Hilarious,"If you want to read something that will make you laugh out loud this is the book for you....written somewhat like the Bridget Jones collection..very entertaining, light read. All of us can relate to the struggles Rebecca has with her money I am sure. I have already read the next book in the collection."
5,I LOVE THIS AUTHOR,"I AM SO ADDICTED TO THIS SERIES OF BOOKS... I love her humor, I can relate to her main characters lives in all of her books.. I can't wait until she comes out with new books I'm always pre-order. TOTALLY ADDICTIVE.. even though I am not a shopaholic I get so pulled into her characters lives. She's my fav. author..."
5,Fabulous and Fun!,"This is one of my favorite books, well the whole series. She's such a fun author, i enjoy all that she's written. Definitely a chick book and a keeper!"
2,Funny as throwing gas on a fire,"I thought this main character was very unlikeable and had very little redeeming qualities. What kind of journey did she travel? Was there any changes to her character? Of course not, because then Sophie Kinsella wouldn't have been able to do a whole slew of shopaholic books. I would have loved her a little if she had tried to take ownership for anything she did."
5,Great read!,Get this book if you're looking to laugh out loud! You will see something of yourself if you rationalize your spending in such a way as Kinsella describes Rebecca. Great laugh...a book to be traded among girlfriends!
2,No sympathy for the Shopaholic,"I like to read some fluffy chick lit now and then so I though this book fit the bill. Honestly, I couldn't stand the main character and I found myself rooting for her and her terrible credit to go down in flames. I just couldn't find anything likeable about her."
5,fun to read!,i enjoyed the book very much!! i've recommnded/bought/passed on 4 copies of it so far......!
5,What a hoot to read!,"This book had me in stitches laughing throughout the chapters. It was light, breezy, and hillarious. The main character is so outlandish, but adorable to the point where you can't help but root for her. I highly recommend this book if you want something non-thought provoking, easy to read, and quick to read."
4,Good book to kill time,"Nice story for some easy reading, nothing deep, just a good girl-meets-boy and girl-gets-boy-even-though-she-messes-up-a-lot book. Very easy to relate with the descriptions of shopping (if you are a shopaholic) and buying things you don't need, though the heroine goes way overboard."
4,From Shopahlic to another....,This book started off a little slow for me...but when I got a few chapters into it I totally couldn't put it down...
3,On Sale!,"This light read is one I almost wanted to put behind a plain brown wrapper. However, there is ""something"" quite engaging about the Lucille Ball antics of the main character."
4,The humor in this book is delightful,Rebecca is a totally nuerotic character that I was rooting for during the whole book. The way Sophie Kinsella writes this character is so amazing. I have never read a book like this before. I really liked the way this book ended.I will definately read more by this author. This was a fun little juant.
4,"breezy, fast read","I started this because of the huge number of 5 star ratings and because I needed a rest after reading Gary Ponzo's ""A Touch of Deceit""! This is the CUTEST book, and you keep wondering how long she can shop, evade, and lie through life. We keep yelling at her to grow up. Turns out she's a lot smarter than even she knew, and that's a relief. Very funny, and I wonder if she got paid for all those product placements! A breezy, fast read. Those who didn't like it must have taken it far too seriously."
4,Cute and a fun read,"If you want a quick story to read that you can pick up at anytime, not worrying about getting too involved, then this is a great story. I will probably read all the stories in the series as my ""frivolous"" indulgence! LOL"
1,One of the worst books I've ever read,"I found absolutely nothing humorous about this book. I won't bother summarizing the plot, simply because there wasn't much of a plot. When I read a book, I want a heroine that's likeable and at least somewhat intelligent. Becky is neither of those things. What she is, is self-centered, immature, and irresponsible. I spent the entire book wanting to shake her sense into her. At the *very end* she finally begin to grow a brain, but that's a long time for the reader to have to wait, and frankly by that time I hated her too much to care what happened to her. I would have given the book zero stars if that had been an option."
1,"Oh God, the apocolypse is near","I can't believe this book got good reviews. I read it when I was fourteen and was completely disgusted. Is her compulsive spending supposed to be cute? The main character is a flat moron who does meaningless moronic things and winds up with a hot boyfriend.Oh Jesus, it makes my stomach hurt, the way this book sells."
1,Annoyed me to the core,I was searching for something lighthearted and I had avoided this book forever. I should have listened to that oh so wise inner voice. The main character was so superficial and irresponsible that I felt no pity for her self serving ways. She was not a person I would have liked to know. I actually got so frustrated reading it that I threw it back on the shelf. But I was bored so I plowed through it. It made me truly appreciate the better writers of this genre. I can not fathom for the life of me what others saw in this book.
1,Started out cute,"I got ""Confessions of a Shopaholic"" for my Kindle for only $.89, and feel it was worth the price. After reading it, I have to say I'm really glad I didn't spend more.The book started off being a cute and fun read, but the main character's complete disregard for accepting any responsibility for her actions, and her apparent inability to rehabilitate herself ultimately made me just have nothing but disdain for her. Before the book was over, I was downright disliking this stupid, foolish, dishonest, irresponsible girl.If there had just been some hint of her finally ""seeing the light"" it would have been so much more tolerable."
5,HILARIOUS!,"This is by far one of the funniest books I have ever read. Eventhough most of the heroin's actions are shallow, and superficial, I think almost every woman can relate to her on some level. Sophie Kinsella is a fabulous author who knows how to write lovable characters you want to root for. Bring on all of the shopoholic books!"
1,Dissapointment,"I can not believe how annoying I found this main character. This is not one of Sophie's best. ""Can you keep a secret"" was 3 times better than this. With Sophie's other books, I have found myself laughing. That was not the case with this book. I think Sophie's writing style has improved tremendously with each book. I rather doubt that I would continue reading this series."
2,"Predictable and mindless, fun yet annoying","I think this book is something like ""13 Going on 30"" meets ""The Devil Wears Prada"", but doesn't nearly live up to either of those. It has some fun moments and while I can relate on some level to this character (my former self, 20 years ago)--for the most part the main character was extremely unsympathetic, stupid, and self-serving to the point that I almost couldn't finish the book. I was fine, but turned a corner when she agreed to go on a date with her flatmate's cousin. At that point, I was totally alienated. This character is a combination of George Costanza from Sienfeld (only George isn't as selfish) and Homer Simpson (except that Homer is less of a fraud) wearing designer clothes. How lucky this author is to have this made into a film--I am sure it will be very lucrative for her, which was likely her goal from the beginning since this book had no point whatsoever."
3,Not impressed,"I have to say, I bought this book at the airport just to have something to read on the plane. I wasn't excited about it at all ....The beginnig was pretty slow, the main character is kind of disturbing ... her spending habits were just not tolerable. The book got better by the end. It was an OK book, overall."
1,Boring!!!!,Though this book would be really good considering the reviews. Must say it was sooooo BORING! Don't get it. The whole thing is a big disapointment.
4,cute!,"whoa! this book is hilarious! it's a great summer read and even better for a ""shopaholic"" like i am!"
5,Read This Book!!!!,"Take my advice, Read this book when you have a few hours to spare because you won't be able to put it down. This was laugh out loud funny. I sat down to read a chapter or two and ended up reading the entire book cover to cover non-stop. I must confess (shopaholic that I am) I can definitly identify with this character. It was like reading my own thoughts. At least I can say I have a little more self-control than she! If you lust for anything with a price tag you'll love this book!"
4,Thank god I haven't gotten this bad yet!,"I have to say for the first few times I opened the book I had to set it down after awhile because I got so stressed. But I thoroughly enjoyed knowing that I am not the only one out there with this disease and that my case is pretty mild compared to some. It definitely helped me to further realize the error in my ways. Yet, I don't have a tall, rich, handsome CEO to help me get over my shopaholism!"
5,Fantastic and fun and true to life,"This story of a 20-something British woman who has gotten a bit over her head in outstanding-credit card debt is hilarious. I dare anyone in my age group to dismiss the story as pure fiction. I could find a bit of myself and many of my friends in this story, and it was reassuring to read about someone else (even a fictional character) who had similar struggles controlling herself at the 1/2 price sale at Macy's last week - thank you Sophie Kinsella!Why, just today I was at the Crate & Barrel outlet convincing myself that while I do not actually need a silver plated ice bucket, at $24.99 it is a true bargain not to be passed up (I bought it). But - I digress...back to the review. You may not love this story - you could find this story trite or predicable or you may just be tired of all the `Brit-Lit' characters - but I guarantee you will be entertained and won't be bored by Rebecca Bloomwood."
5,...,"Sophie Kinsella has scored big with this book- Confessions of a Shopaholic. It is the ultimate pick-me-up!You find yourself endeared to Rebecca ""Becky"" Bloomwood, a 20-something writer at a financial magazine who hates her job and what it pays....but loves shopping! She is a compulsive shopper, she just can't resist that D&G; scarf, those numerous bottles of Oddbins...and stationary? Well, just had to have it!Those 6 words are what Rebecca lives by. Yet, what is absolutely hilarious is that she recognizes she has a problem, and she even tries to strategize to solve it (cutting back, making more, saving, even working an extra job!), but she can't, until...Well, you'll just have to read it's greatly surprising ending.And, as a note Ms. Kinsella, I will be the first to buy your next book!"
1,Insultingly bad,"I'd rate this novel on the level of a Danielle Steel novel where unrealistic expectations of finding a solution to the ""money problem"" are just as unrealistic as finding the ""perfect love."" One of the few books I've read where I want both my money and time spent reading it back. Shopping as addiction isn't all that amusing and the writing was of poor quality. I kept hoping it was a parody, but no such luck. And what's with the ending??? Since when does more money really spell the end of all our worries? If given no self control, most will spent above their income limit, whatever it may be. Does that mean we're in for a sequel? Hope not."
4,"Fun, fun, fun",This book is really fun! It probably won't change your life but it will make you laugh and brighten your day. It is a great book for the beach. A great summer read!
4,Charming...but also one more Brit Singleton story.,"This novel follows the Brit singleton formula that has developed from Helen Fielding's ""Bridget Jones' Diary"". It's the closest novel I've read to the two Bridget Jones' novels.It makes for a great beach read and pageturner. You know that the tribulations of Becca Bloomwood will turn around-- and they do very quickly. High marks for making Luke Brandon an appealing and mysterious character.My main problems with 'Confessions' are its predictable and unrealistic plot. But this is a charming story with a tight plot; I couldn't put it down. If you want to laugh uproarously about someone's shopping sprees and credit card woes this is the story. I look forward to reading more novels by Sophie Kinsella."
5,Cute,A fun and frothy summer read. Anyone who has shopped too much will recognize a bit of themselves in Rebecca. This was a fast and easy read. I enjoyed it from beginning to end.
4,Nonstop fun!,"If you're searching for a relaxing, LIGHT read for the summer, look no further. This book is so much fun, and the pages fly by in a breeze! You couldn't ask for a better book for a trip to the beach or to accompany you on a long plane ride. Rebecca's adventures -- and the rationalizations that keep her shopping, despite the fact that, as a financial journalist, she knows better! -- are guaranteed to keep you laughing. This is another terrific British novel in the tradition of Bridget Jones et al. I'm so happy that American publishers have started bringing us more of these books by hip young UK writers. Keep 'em coming, please!"
4,"Decent, funny read","Confessions Of A Shop-a-holic reminded me a lot of Bridget Jones' Diary. Becky and Bridget are a lot alike: flaky, funny British women who end up getting their guy. But Bridget is more introspective and reflects on what she's done wrong, and she isn't manipulative like Becky. Also, I couldn't really relate to the character's problem of shopping addiction, because I hate shopping! Especially for clothes. Total misery. But a good point is that a lot of other women (I guess I'm not a typical female) will be able to relate to it.Even though I couldn't relate to her compulsive shopping, this book did get some genuine laughs and cringes from me. Sophie Kinsella has a way of putting you inside the story, so you feel as though you're watching the action.On the downside, Confessions was predictable at times and the light-hearted, fast-paced tone got old. But I would recommend it to anyone who wants a nice distraction book to read, and it really is quite funny. :)"
5,It takes you away...,"I just finished Confessions of a Shopaholic and honestly, I found myself daydreaming of when I win the lottery (as does the main character) and picking out expensive clothing to buy. It really makes you forget what you're doing and just wonder what is going to happen in this girls life!"
2,boring,"i didnt really like this one....there wasnt very many funny parts, i still could relate to Becky, so i guess thats what kept me reading. i was hoping it would get better, but it never did....""can you keep a secret"" is MUCH better....i havent given up yet....ive started the next one in the series, and i will continue to keep reading the whole series.....im hoping this one is better."
4,A Quick and Entertaining Read,This is a great book if you're not looking for anything too serious. This book was entertaining and kept me laughing
4,Stylish,"Of the most reviewed books that I've read in the chick-lit genre, this is my favorite so far. The heroine is undoubtedly shallow and somewhat unscrupulous, but if I'd liked her any better I'd have had heart seizure every time she walked into another embarrassing situation. The best feature about this book, in my opinion, was that it was neatly structured. The increasing tension was well orchestrated, and the characters (other than the Hooray-Henries) were likeable and (other than Rebecca) believable. Unlike with some of the American chick-lit writers I've read, I felt I was in the hands of a pro."
4,Very Cute,"This book is really entertaining. I wouldn't call it laugh out loud hilarious but its really funny to watch her justify her purchases. It does kind of make you feel sorry for compulsive spenders though. You just want to grab Rebecca and shake her and say ""What Is The Matter With You?!!!!"""
1,Not for Collectors,"I was really disappointed in the poor quality of these bowls. They're obviously knockoffs and the art work is not even close to the original Franciscanware. While these bowls may be practical and useful for everyday use, if you're a collector of this dinnerware, do not buy these to replace broken pieces. I'm really glad that I didn't buy other pieces that I am looking for."
4,Very Nice Design,I realy like this deep fryer. I like the fact that you can lower the foods into the oil with the lid closed. The rotation of the food tray is also a nice feature. You use alot less oil and the foods come out very crisp. Clean up is a breeze!This is a very well designed product.
5,AMAZING PRODUCT,This thing is amazing. I will never own a different deep fryer. The quality of food that comes out of this fryer is incredible.
4,a good workout,I could definitely feel it in my legs and glutes after doing this workout. I would reccommend this to anyone trying to tone the lower body and slim down. It does work!!!
2,Not A Fan,"I ordered this video when I ordered the Julianne Hough Cardio Ballroom and after falling in love with the Cardio Ballroom video I decided to give this DVD a chance. I wish I could get my money back. There is no instruction which leaves me sitting there trying to figure out what they are doing rather than actually moving. I am not a dancer so that could be part of the problem, but from now on Im sticking with Julianne."
2,Not what I expected,This was a boring and lackluster exercise DVD. I'm sorry I wasted my money. It's truly not a good exercise tape.
4,Fun dance workout,"This was a pleasant surprise. The workouts are fun and fresh. Great instruction, good music and super fun movements that are easy to follow. This DVD truly makes me feel like I am dancing, and it is just a bucket full of fun."
2,Not a workout!,"I like to mix and match my workout, and that is why I bought this DVD. When doing a dance workout, I want to do just that...WORK OUT. I have two Dancing with the Stars Dvds and this is the worse. My goal when working out is to burn as many calories as possible and still have a little fun. I barely broke out a sweat with this DVD. It will be okay for a beginner. For those who are more seasoned, I recommend Zumba or Dancing with the Stars: Dance off the Pounds. Here, you actually break a sweat."
2,Too simple,"This 2nd-year Latin text is good for students at the remedial level, as all of the exercises are very simple--normally one line long. Certain respected professors consider the text ""worthless,"" but use it for lack of another 2nd-year text. The typeface is not very pretty, either. (monospace font)"
5,This book is a life line,I have a first edition of this book. I have carried it around for ten years. I cannot imagine life without it. I owe the authors a debt of gratitude.
5,Great daily reading,"Awesome meditational readings for recovering people. I love it! You will too. To have in my Kindle is a gift, along with my other collection of recovery reading."
2,Too small,"Thinking I was receiving a ""usual"" sized music book, I was surprised when I received something much smaller, making it difficult to read the music. If I were to use it, I'd have to copy it to a much larger size."
5,Lucky Find,"I happened upon this book in our local library, and it really is a gem of a book. It doesn't seem like there are nearly as many Easter books readily available that speak to the true reason for the season as there are for Christmas. I love the way this book very subtly wove in the Easter eggs and Easter bunny without actually mentioning them as such and all along keeping the Easter focus where it's really supposed to be. It really kept my children's attention, too. I intend to add this book to our personal library and gift it to my godkids as well."
1,Useless,"I really don't know what I was expecting. Maybe the ""National Geographic"" tag pulled me in. The only thing I got out of this book was to attempt to admire the photographs used as examples. Even then, they weren't that good. But what do I know. Make sure you know what you want before you spend your change on this."
3,Picture This,"Hello All,Ok, so I needed some help to shoot a few pics of family and friends so, I picked up a copy of this book. My first impression was that it seemed to have some good tips and techniques but, upon reading it thoroughly, I have to say folks, this one falls a bit short. I have made the move into the realm of digital media and as such, am hungry for help IN THOSE AREAS. This book just doesn't go there enough for me. Sure, you'll get plenty of tips pertaining to FILM media but, what I want is DIGITAL!Would I buy this book again, probably not BUT, if I was still using film, then this book would fill the bill.Ciao All!!"
5,This Book Will Inspire and Teach!,"This book describes what you need to know to make good pictures of people. The book begins by discussing composition and then turns to equipment and lighting. The book then focuses on various types of people photography: street photography; people in action; portraits; familar subjects (family members) and the photographic essay. The book includes a list of useful web sites and explains how three professional photograhers work. They are Cary Wolinsky, Sisse Brimberg and Lynn Johnson. I love these different viewpoints because they provide food for thought.The photographs leap off the page. They are stunning and make me want to get out and photograph. I highly recommend this book. It also is of a size that will easily fit in your camera bag."
3,It's Ok,"Maybe I read too many of their photography how-to books, but I don't find this book that useful. Basically, if you read their ""Secrets to Making Great Pictures"" book, this is a repeat of that book and half the size. It's short, but it kinda wasted like a day or two of my life - the time it took me to finish the book."
3,Not for casual photos,For advanced well-equipped photographers. I threw it away. I would not recommend it to anyone. one. two. three. four. five.
2,Not worth the effort.,"The strings lost tune much too quickly and had me wanting to replace them within a month of very light usage. I would recommend Elixer brand strings for the average guitar connoisseur. However, if you intend for drop down tuning or you're using them for a short time, I suppose you could get them, but for Pete's sake don't bother."
2,DeLonghi Espresso Maker,"This is an okay little machine, but I am on-line shopping for a replacement. The frother is great--one of the best I've used--but the espresso isn't that good IMHO and the filter is not the standard size so I would have to buy $9.00 duplicates. Also, the smaller filter requires it be tapped down on the machine itself (that white knob/disk you see near the filter holder) and that is very messy."
3,Did not last more than six months,"The frother worked great. Made good coffee for six months, then quit heating the water and no steam. Pump still works but what good is cold water. Very disappointed in the quality."
1,Don't buy. They don't honor their warrantee,"Bought in June last year. Broke down in Jan. Sent in for repair. Still waiting. Bad part is thermostat. Delonghi said it is on back order. FOUR MONTHS????? Poor quality and very bad customer service. WHen it did work, it did make great coffee. Delonghi also said this model is not made anymore. Why sell it????"
4,Great machine with good price.,"Well, I get a BAR14F from the local dealer(I am in Beijing)which I think it should be the same model as BAR140 as in US market. This is my first home espresso machine and I think it's great. just after read the user's guide for a few mins, I can make good espresso and cappucinno at home now. the espresso has rich crema, and it make good milk for cuppcinno.the disadvantage for this machine is that a bit noisy when it's working. the tamper is a build-in one. and u can't use bigger cup higher than 8.5cm."
2,A Cappuccino Man,"I purchased this machine to replace an old Krups that simply wore out. I was not able to look at various machines and relied heavily on the Amazon reviews in making my selection. Since I'm cappuccino drinker, I was disheartened to discover that I didn't own a cup shallow enough to fit under the coffee dispensing spout! In addition, I was very disappointed in the milk steamer/frother. I like a thick milk froth on my cappuccino, but this machine just wouldn't do it. All I was able to get from it was thick hot milk. It may be a great espresso machine, but if you are a cappuccino drinker, I suggest you look elsewhere."
1,Junk! A Waste of Space In The Trash Can!,"When I first bought the Delonghi Bar 140 espresso machine it worked great. Great espresso! I WAS very happy with it. Three months later the pump went out. I bought this unit NEW on EBay and the seller wouldn't take it back. It was susposed to have a full warranty. Delonghi wouldn't honor the warranty because the seller wasn't a authorized dealer. I threw it in the trash. I bought another Delonghi espresso machine but, this one is the stainless steel model EC-701 and it has been going now for four years. Two espressos everyday seven days a week. This one is a keeper."
3,AprilL,"Was very frantically trying to find parts when I opened this the day before Thanksgiving and things weren't there. Was missing a thumb screw and the counterbalance. Great idea, poor execution. The product works but is definitely not worth seventy dollars. Would not recommend this company."
4,Cute bag. Well made,"This is a cute and pretty little purse. It is just big enough for your wallet, phone and keys. Very minimalistic but well made and classy. Nice leather. The description says it has microfiber lining but mine is just regular polyester or whatever fabric on the inside, certainly no microfiber.The handle is small, it is best to hold it in your hand. It always slides off my shoulder.I sure like this purse but don't use it very often. I got it for days when all I want is a purse to hold my essentials, whatever I have in my pockets when wearing pants should go into this purse when I wear dresses. And it will hold all of that but I don't think it suits me. I am not a girly-girl, just a regular women. I think this will go best with small women or teenagers."
1,Disappointed in this fryer,"I had great hopes in this fryer, but the first time that I used it, it was a failure. The first batch cooked fine, but the fryer shut off and I couldn't get it to re-heat. I checked the magnetic cord and played around with temp adjustments, but nothing worked. I had half of my fish fried and the other half NOT fried. I had a $100.00 fryer on my counter and was frying fish in a frying pan because it wasn't working! :( That was pretty sad. I thought the basket handle was a pain too. I had to return this fryer. I bought the deep fryer with Emeril's name on it. It's made by T-fal. That one can be disassembled and most of it can go in the dishwasher. It also has a filtering system that filters that allows you to easily filter the oil after each use. It was more expensive, but it has made dealing with the oil mess much easier."
5,Awesome Food Fryer,"We had an old fry daddy a long, long time ago. Then we used pans on the stove.... Finally purchased a food fryer and this is the best ever!!! It was safe, didn't ""stink"" up the house, easy to clean and minimal grease volume on the food. You can't go wrong. We couldn't believe how quickly we cleaned up. A healthy hint: Use Coconut Oil - organic virgin coconut if can. Food tastes great. This is a definite buy for anyone wanting a food fryer. We are new to the fryer game, but eating healthy with this fryer. The rotating basket is great. BUY IT!!!"
2,"Worked great for one month and a day, now it doesn't work at all","I was excited about this deep fryer. I bought it as a gift for my girlfriend, who used it twice to make crabpuffs. It cooked evenly and was easy to clean--a very good design. Unfortunately, the third time we turned it on, it would not heat the oil at all. Amazon's warranty had expired the day before this happened. We got very little satisfaction for $100. Compared to my parent's fry daddy, which has worked consistently for a couple of decades, this is not a great performance."
3,ROTO Fryer,"I've been getting acquainted with this fryer for only a few days and, wow, what great fries, fish, chicken. But then the rotation stopped. I lifted the basket and noticed that the shaft was not turning. Amazon is sending me another.By the way, my beer batter didn't mess up the basket. I lowered the chicken into the already lowered basket with tongs and it worked great."
2,High Maintenance Costs,"Although DeLonghi makes a good deep fryer, please consider the cost of replacement filters before you buy. DeLonghi replacement filters do not last very long and they are not easy to find. If you buy them directly from DeLonghi America, one pack of replacement filters can cost as much as $32.00 plus $4.50 for shipping! (Amazon does sell one type of replacement filter for $17.99, but your DeLonghi deep fryer might not use them.) One pack of replacement filters usual includes 3 sets of filters. The 6-piece set includes 3 carbon filters and 3 oil vapor filters. If you use your DeLonghi deep fryer often, the cost of replacement filters could easily exceed the cost of the DeLonghi deep fryer in one year! It could be less expensive to simply buy a brand new DeLonghi deep fryer each time you run out of filters. Just food for thought!"
1,Poor Performance for batter fried foods,"I thought the idea of the food not staying in the oil for the entire cooking time was a good idea; and maybe it is. However, our deep frying is mainly batter fried foods like coconut shrimp, fried oysters, etc. With this unit the batter will flow through the wire basket and stick to the basket. This makes it impossible to remove the food without practically destroying the food in the process. It seems to me a nonstick basket would be an excellent idea; I guess the DeLonghi engineers never thought of that. It may work just fine for french fries or breaded food; I don't know. If batter fried foods are your preference, stay away from this unit."
4,An excellent indulgence,"I am a sucker for many deep fried foods, fries, onion rings, hush puppies, etc. The first day I got this item I put it to the test. Fries and rings no problem. Hush puppies which for those not familiar with the southern delicacy are doughy ball like things made of corn meal, onion and other spices. They are doughy but the deep fryer handled them well. There was no sticking; I think the key is to get the basket hot so they do not stick. The rotation worked fine you just need to make sure the basket is seated properly. It also does a good job with less oil. I give 4 stars just because I am only allowed to use it bi weekly."
3,Flawed,"I used to own the larger Delonghi fryer but we managed to melt part of it by placing it next to a hot stove.Big negative: the AC power cord is only 1 foot long and attaches magnetically to the fryer. Therefore, it always falls out and is a pain to place.Small negatives: (1) The fryer capacity is small. (2) the small plastic feet under the fryer also fall out.Positive: The rotor works well and is easy to clean."
1,No Customer Service,"I loved this product at first. I only owned it a little over one year when it stopped heating. After some research I discovered that a ""thermal safety switch"" needed to be replaced. At first they advised that I had to take it to an authorized service center. There isn't one within hundreds of miles of where I live. I then asked them if they could just send me the part so that I could find someone to fix it. They flatly refused.This is the price of poor customer service I went from recommending Delonghi products to advising people to stay clear of that product brand."
2,"No Fish with batter, but chips OK","It cannot be used to fry battered fish or shrimps, they stick to the basket and are miserable to get out! Any wet batter runs through the basket mesh and seals itself to the basket and sometimes the bottom of the oil holder. So don't try tempura or fish & chips.Breaded frozen fish are OK, but you can do them in the oven. Chicken wings are also OK.Stan Graham"
1,DeLonghi Fryer Scary Incident,"I purchased DeLonghi Fryer from Amazon about 2 years ago for $99. It's a great fryer and I used it about once a month or so. While I was cooking some egg rolls, I noticed a puddle of oil all over my kitchen counter. At first I thought the drain hose was leaking but the hot oil was leaking from the main body of the fryer. It was a completely nightmare to clean the hot oil that leaked all over my kitchen counter and cabinet. It was very scary. I emailed the DeLonghi customer service and they told me to take it to a service center. When I called the service center, it was going to be at least $65 to repair it! Now it's sitting in my garage ready to be taken to a dumpster. I should just ship this thing to DeLonghi and let them see for themselves this defective product. I definitely would not purchase this product again."
1,Didn't work,"The first time I used the fryer, I read the directions twice and followed them to the letter, but after 20-30 minutes the light showing that the oil was up to temperature did not go off. After thinking the light must be broken I tried cooking my fries. I figured almost half an hour should be long enough to heat oil. It is certainly sufficient when cooking on the stove. After 6 minutes in the oil the fries were soggy. At that point I opened the lid to discover the oil was lukewarm. I repacked the machine and sent it back."
1,Huge Disappointment!,"I received the Delonghi deep fryer on Friday evening and had it at the post office on Monday morning. I did everything EXCEPT stand on my head to get it to make potato chips...smaller batches, larger batches, shorter cooking times, longer cooking times. What I did get, consistantly, resembled more a potato cake which was soggy in the middle. I bought a Waring Pro at William Sonoma for $40 more and had beautiful potatos Monday evening. Bottom line...Delonghi may be a bit cheaper and a tad easier to clean, but I want good tasting food."
2,Small Fry Performance For a Big Fry Price,"After two uses, the basket stopped turning. Two months with the Delonghi authorized repair technician, and I finally got it back. Well, my experience with tempura was miserable (...). The batter oozes through the mesh and pollutes the oil and sticks to the mesh (making it virtually impossible to remove). Also, if you have anything that is taller than a small mushroom, parts of it will not be submerged in the oil (read: won't fry) The unit is for very small batches of flat, dry type foods (breast strips in panko crumbs or the like). I had a ""cheap"" $... Salton fryer which worked better. The Goodwill wound up with it after I got my prized Delonghi. Boy, am I ever sorry."
1,Extremely disappointed,"I bought this model because a friend had one and highly recommended it--but he did so before he'd used it much. I think he, like me, was seduced by the marketing copy and the purported features of this appliance (like the rotating basket which was supposed to keep the food evenly bathed in the hot oil). Unfortunately, it just hasn't lived up to its promise. For one thing, it just doesn't hold enough food at once. A batch of sweet potato chips (3-4 potatoes worth) takes at least an hour as I can only fry a small handful of chips at a time. For another thing, the rotating basket feature only worked the first time I used the fryer; now the basket doesn't rotate at all. I've tried all of the suggestions in the manual for addressing the problem, but the basket won't budge.On the (only slightly) plus side, it is very easy to clean, but I would not recommend a fryer on that basis alone."
3,It's just ok,"This fryer is ok, but that's about it. Instead of Easy Clean System, they should call it ""It takes a long time to clean"". There are so many components that need to be cleaned, it's about a 20 minute process (not counting what you put in the dishwasher). Also, they capacity is very limited. Three chicken thighs is max. So your cooking for 1.5 persons or in multiple batches. It did fry OreIda fozen fast food french fries better than McDonalds, but it's not really worth the hassle of the clean up. Would I recommend it? No. A simple frying pan is so simple to use. And now with the new recycling rules, I just dump the used oil on top of the lawn clipping in the recycle toter. It's not worth saving it in the provided container....just another item to clean later."
1,How overcooking cod fish can destroy a newly redecorated room,We invited another couple to come participate in our first use of the DeLonghi food fryer. We followed the directions and used new vegatable oil and set the temp as directed. After the fish was lowered in the basket into the oil the oil began to boil in much the same manner as what is called a rolling boil in cooking pasta in a large pot. We cooked the fish for the prescribed time ( a few minutes) and found that even that it looked ok that it was way over cooked. Plus the batter was cemented to the basket. The smell of fish oil permeated the kithchen and the family room which had just been repainted and all the drapes and furniture reupholstered. The smell moved on to affect the house at large. It took 3 days for the smell to dissipate.Joe Malone 912-598-8741
1,Doesn't Heat Correctly,"I got this to fry chicken, which is does okay but seemed to take a long time. So this time with it set to high (370), when the light went out I checked the temp with 3 thermometers; the highest reading I got was 320.No wonder it was taking so long. It's no longer under warranty so it's going in the trash.I like the features and the fact I can fry with one bottle of oil, but if the temperature doesn't go over 320 it's useless.Not recommended."
2,Is this eve rust proof?,"IS THIS RUST PROOF? BECAUSE THE BASKET STARTED TO RUST IN JUST TWO USINGS. I' m not sure it' s food stains, or rust but I' m having great trouble reusing it until I figure out why the basket browned a bit. seems like rust but I am still investigating.Also, the basket is incredibly difficult to clean. It' s not non- stick, so any amount of fried flour, etc will stick on the basket and won' t come off even with scraping. I had it soaked in water for a day and then scrabbed it, then used toothbrush to clean it thouroughly. And the basket may not even be rust- proof. Better save your money and buy a stainless steel unit, though I heard stainless steel ones still have trouble with cleaning as the food does stick on it as well."
1,These machines operate at far below temperature,"This would be a good machine for 1 or 2 people if not for one very major flaw. Confirmed with my 2 professional laser and pen thermometers, the units runs 25-40 cooler than the thermostat reads. This results, of course, in soggy fried foods. If this was the case with only one machine, I would chalk it up to a defective unit, but it was the same case with its new replacement, too. Surprisingly, De Longhi customer service was largely uninterested in the temperature issue. Upon communicating my problem, the customer support lady asked me, ""Well, does it cook? I have one and I never pay attention to the temperature."" I guess this illustrates the company's commitment to producing an accurate machine."
4,Go Fishin,I've had the unit for a year now and it looks and performs like the day I bought it. It is just right for frying for two people but for a group I still prefer the old oil in a pot method. Cleanup takes about 5 minutes but is easy. My wife says the filters still leave an odor in the house so I use it outside. Great machine!
2,Very poor to non-existent operating instructions,"I cannot believe this company has the nerve to provide an operating booklet that is of NO HELP... Most comapnies provide you with a complimentary cook book. Not DeLonghi. They provide an [inexpensive] paper outline of the product. I am also not happy with the way the basket keeps falling off the roller when you try to lift it in and out of the fryer. It does fry well, but I am very displeased with both of these problems. If I did not throw out the box, it would be returned."
3,"Cooks well, Too small. Hard to clean.",I have owned this fryer for 3 years and use it at least once a week. OK for making food for a couple of people but the basket really is just too small. Half a bag of frozen french fires or one large potato cut up is the max. I also need to deep fry for a minute then let it heat up again before finishing to cook (to prevent the oil getting too cool- not much thermal mass). The rotor works fine and does not use much oil. I only drain the oil out when I replace it but it drains well. Easy to change the oil. The basket and rotor assembly is pretty complicated and I can understand folks having issues with it (never had any problems myself tho).
5,Extremely clean and limited smell from frying even fish. I used Canola Oil not the recommended Peanut Oil. Great.,"Easy to clean, I removed the basket from the handle and cleaned in the dishwasher. Limited smell in house."
1,Delonghi D895UX....not too hot... not too large...not good at all...,"Delonghi D895UX is a good idea that in my opinion that has not been perfected. I had the Dehlonghi D677UX 2.5lb. fryer for the last 7 years and used it frequently with no problems to great success. I got the Delonghi D895UX from Amazon Warehouse open box, new returned, refurbished department for $30 less than retail. The particular item description said the fryer was an open box repackaged. I figured for $30 less I would take a chance on getting a good fryer. Well...The fryer turned out to manefest all the problems listed here for this item. It does not get hot enough...it doesn't have enough room...the cooking method requires longer times to cook even if the fryer got hot enough. I am sending this back to Amazon and ordering the D677UX 2.5 lb. fryer. I had one of those the previous 7 years with no problems."
2,Very Disappointed,"After using it around 10 times, I've found that it ceases to rotate probably 1/2 the time. It has a very small capacity (can't cook enough chicken fingers for a family of four). Also, the basket is NOT non-stick, so the food sticks to the basket and is difficult to remove. Clean up is fairly easy, that's the only positive thing to be said. As mentioned, there is no recipe book included, which was vexing. Save your money, this is disappointing in all aspects. I've had it for less than 2 months and am looking to replace it already."
1,Do not buy Delonghi product,"Despite the high price, my roto fryer did not work from the day one. The basket rotates when you first turn it on but it always stops working. Apparently, a lot of people had the same problem. Also, they don't have service centers in every state, so if you have a problem, it's going to be tough and expensive to get it fixed."
5,This fryer is great!,"My husband wanted a deep fryer so he could make fried calimari. I researched a few, and found the roto fryer to have the best reviews, and liked that it used less oil. It works great, and is relatively easy to clean. It uses about 1 liter of oil, and is designed to make draining and saving the oil painless."
5,The best in the business,"Once you have one of these, you won't understand how you made do with anything else. It is without a doubt the best fryer out there. I've gone through dozens in my time and this puppy beats them all hands down."
5,"exactly what i hoped for, and more!","Length:: 2:00 MinsJust thought i post a video trying to answer all the questions i had when i considered buying this product. i was a bit hesitant at first since there were no reviews, but i took a chance and im damn glad i did lolThe pieces that plug into your gun operate exactly like a pressure washer nozzle if you ever used or hooked one up, its very easy and saves u air u might waste when disconnecting.for demonstration i used two 20oz Tanks and the guns used was a ""RAP4 T68 M4"" - black and a ""Worr machine EG"" - Blue"
1,Broke after second use.,"I was really happy with this product the first time I used it, and I don't think I was very rough on it. I used it for about 4 hours of woodsball and went through a couple of tanks. A couple weeks later I went to use it again, and it let all the air out of my tank, then another tank. Don't know what's wrong with it, and I waited too long to return, so now I'm stuck with it."
2,Lisa Barbuscia -is simply gorgeous,"It may be a poor movie, but it is an opportunity to see once of the most beautiful women in the world, Lisa Barbuscia. Her eyes...and the rest her are simply breath takingsee her in the last Highlander and Almost Heroes, where she plays the part of the Indian maiden. Her eyes make me melt."
5,Hot,Loved this as a kid...and adult! That Lisa B. who plays the seductress lady is smoking hot! This has to be one of the most underrated seductive movies out there. Its not porn...more so sexy sex. lol!
5,Must-Read for young filmmakers,"This book is a absolute must for anyone who wants to make a film using digital video. It explains the real in-and-outs of the process while offering opinions and insights from producers and directors who've succedded at it. If you want to use your nice digital camera for something bigger than birthday parties, (not that there's anything wrong with that), check this book out. It's INSPIRING!"
3,"get ""Just You, Just Me"" instead","""One Alone"" doesn't compare well with Dave Brubeck's prior solo effort,Just You Just Me. It's not that the selection of songs isn't interesting, it's just that Brubeck's slow amble through nearly each one isn't terribly inspiring. On the other hand ""Just You, Just Me,"" recorded six years earlier (1994), finds the pianist sharply focused and full of all kinds of inventive ideas; and while his treatments for both albums were no doubt thoroughly worked out in advance, they sound fresh and spontaneous in ""Just You, Just Me"" versus stale and almost dirge-like on ""One Alone."" If you want to hear Brubeck solo, the earlier album, which is a real gem, is the one to get."
3,"It does, what it does.","The shipping service was excruciating. It took about 2 weeks for this to come into the mail. Hey, seller, you should try to get in on this Amazon Prime deal. Other than the painful shipping wait, the product is what's advertised. The product is okay/neutral. I personally did not like using the tape, so I went and bought glue from the store. I know, failure upon my behalf.I really have to say, if you're not living in some remote area where these things can't be bought, just go to the store. Shipping took way longer than advertised.(first world problems)"
3,"Okay, but not great",These recipes are far too simple for my taste but suitable for beginner cooks who might need instruction on preparation of beans and grains. I was not inspired.
1,nothing new,these recipes are for the very starving. Nothing exciting about any of them. I am sure his later works are much better.
4,Great book-If you're on the Fuhrman Plan,"If you're on Joel Fuhrman's Eat to Live plan then this cookbook is indispensable. Recipes are free of processes foods, oil, salt, and there are many wheat-free options."
4,Yummy AND Healthy!,"Like I said, yummy!! I ""cheat"" occasionally by adding a bit of salt, and sometimes just a tad of butter & cooking wine...but for the most part all the recipes turn out and are plenty flavorful. The best part is that I actually get full; this is the only cookbook I can say that for of all the literally hundreds I've bought through the years."
4,Eat to Live Fans will love this book,"this book has simple recipes that are delicious. If you are a Vegetarian, this is for you...and even if you're not a Vegetarian, these are great healthy alternatives if you just want to cut back on consumption of animal products."
2,I can't read the time!,"The photo shows legible white numbers on a black background. Well, the background is black, all right, but the numbers can best be described as grayish yellow. Though they are large, they are almost unreadable in many light conditions, and completely unreadable in some light conditions. I found myself using the backlight in the early morning and evening when I should have been able to read the time easily. As for the day/month/day -- well, I've scarcely ever been able to make them out! I'm returning this and ordering a watch with a more conventional dial."
3,this is a live cd,This is the second album I have bought by the meteors and both turned out to be live cds. Neither of which had any warning that the cd was live. This cd is pretty good not great. Really bad recording quality. Pyschobilly revolution which is the other live cd I have by them is better.
5,Installation of Valley receiver,I found the installation of this product quite easy. All the hardware was in the box and instructions. It took approximatley 30 minutes to install but I did find that on the 2005 ford F-150 it was easier to take the bolts that went into the frame through a hole forward of where the hitch bolts on than going through the back of the frame. Much shorter distance and easier to feed the wire through.
4,Nice,"This cd is nice, specially if you like Pink Floyd. Still prefer the Bob Marley one for the babies."
5,Good Ground Cloth for Tent,I found that this tarp was a good weight of material for a tent ground cloth. It is not too bulky and heavy but it is not too flimsy either. My tent is 8x10 and I got this oversized because the actual size of most tarps are smaller. I would suggest this item for lighter weight applications. I don't think it would hold up to something like a wood pile cover outdoors for too long since the grommets aren't reinforced and because of its lighter weight. For the purpose I got this for it works very well.
3,Loose Gromet,"I wish I could give this a five star rating but the first night I took it out camping, one of the gromets pulled apart from the material and the wind or pressure on it didn't seem to be that high. If the makers would re-enforce the gromets, this would be a great product."
2,Poor quality,"This tarp tore on the very first use, it's of poor quality. I would not recommend it. I don't think Amazon carries good tarps, I ended up searching the web and purchasing from another retailer."
2,New Guide is Not So New,"I bought the 1997 (or brown covered) encyclopedia a few years back (which I love by the way) and decided to purchase the updated version to find new and updated information such as new wineries or ones that were upcoming and warranted coverage in the new book. I am so dissapointed. The only change I could find is a box containing information on wine quality from 1997 to 2000. Tom Stevenson didn't even change one word in his cover letter! Even the page numbers in each book have the same information! The winery ratings didn't change - or not from what I could tell. Unless I can actually see what's inside the next version, I will never purchase an version again. If you own an earlier version, do not purchase this book - it's a waste of money.I rated it 2 stars, not because of the content, but because it is not updated as the cover indicates (see red circle). I do however question just how much Tom Stevenson puts into research with each book edition if nothing c"
5,Old but Golden,"By today's standards this is an ancient account. Nonetheless, for those without an electronics background this is still the most accessible explanation of what goes on at the hardware / firmware level of computing equipment. Still HIGHLY recommended for high-level programmers who want a clue about the substrate."
5,Jessica....you changed your image!,I love this album...Jessica's voice is beautiful and she is truly talented...she definitely deserved to win but now I have a question....how did she end up in the competition having had an album out already and Deltrice who had nothing out loses...hmmmmm?
2,This Album is terrible,"After listening to this album, I am very disappointed. When Jessica first won on ""Road to Stardom"" I was so excited because I knew her album would be slamming. But it was a total shock after hearing this album. Jessica's voice is very soulful and very original.However, this album did not show none of that. Her songs that she wrote for her audition sounded alot better. Somebody please just let her write her own damn songs."
1,Poor Quality,"The wires and the slots were not properly aligned on this item, and it broke on the first slice. Very poor quality."
2,Somewhat dull,"This is no doubt an efficient egg slicer, but it was rather dull and boring. I wanted an egg slicer with a bit more pizazz, a bit more spiciness, a bit more excitement and spark.We need a glitzy egg slicer."
2,Reciever Great. Amazon Shipping Pathetic,"I will be glad to give Valley a 5 star rating for the receiver hitch for my tacoma. It's a great value and fits perfectly. I would advise you to buy it somewhere else, though. There was basically no shipping package and the unit arrived with scuffs in several places on the powdercoat that I will have to paint to prevent rust in the future. Because or the poor or almost no packaging the hardware was lost and I spent $22 at the hardware store to buy the bolts to install the hitch.Synopsis: Valley hitch - 5 stars Amazon Shipping - 1 star or no stars"
5,Quality product,"I have installed after market hitches on my previous trucks. So I was expecting to struggle with this hitch to have it align under my 09 Tacoma. I am still amaze at how easy the installation was; everything fits like a glove, and the installed hitch looks like a factory installed unit. This is one of the best purchase experiences; highly recommended"
1,Delonghi AS670 glass door spontaneously shatters.,"We bought a Delonghi 670 and used it for about a year. During this time the on/off swith failed and was not covered under warranty. We replaced it at our cost. But the BIG PROBLEM occurred when the front glass door spontaneously shattered and showered the kitchen with fragments of glass! The Delonghi representative said this was not covered by any warranty, implied or expressed. I can't imagine buying another Delonghi oven."
1,don't buy it,"control knobs broke off inside the toaster after less than 6 months of light use rendering it unusable. delonghi has the rudest, most ineffective customer service i have ever encountered. the oven has been out for repairs for 8 weeks now and they still won't give me an estimate of when it will be returned, nor will they replace it.....and they are not even polite about it. i will never buy a delonghi product again."
2,Don't buy this oven!,"Don't buy this oven if you want one that is easy and safe to operate. It seems to perform well, but the controls are awful! They are difficult to set and YOU CAN'T TURN THE TOASTER OFF in the middle of the cyce! That means, if the toast is getting too dark, or you're in a hurry and want to take it out, or you changed your mind, YOU CAN'T turn it off! If you take the toast out in the middle of the cycle, the toaster will continue to run, empty and you risk burning youself on the coils which don't shut off. I have never had a toaster or toaster oven that didn't allow you to ""pop"" the toast out in the middle. This is awful design! I'll stick to Black and Decker!"
2,Avoid,"Been through 2 of these already, pretty much 1/year - just long enough to be out of warranty naturally. The heating rods bend and then break, rendering them useless.I'd give it 1 star, except that when it works, it works well. I just can't see buying one every year. Perhaps if they were about 1/2 the cost, I could justify it."
1,Great... when it works,"I purchased this oven 1.5 yrs ago and loved it. I use it anytime I can over my regular oven because it cooks better- more evenly, heats faster, and does a great job of convection baking. The problem is the quality. The door does get hot, but after 1 year, the knob broke off that sets the function, so it's stuck on toast forevermore. I do think it would be an improvement if they made it a little taller - sometimes it's good to have more height than the bottom rack setting allows.The feet on the bottom were never right, but that didn't seem to affect performance, so I ignored it. Overall I'd have to say the quality is among the worst out there. Great idea, bad implementation."
2,it's all true,It's all true. The knobs break off and the DeLonghi customer service is horrendous. I have 2 friends with the same toaster and the exact same bad experience. Don't buy it!
1,Toast? Wait 10 minutes,"The toast feature leaves a lot to be desired. Not only does it take a long time, but after turning the brownness selector back, it can not be turned off when the toast finally is done."
3,Grill the seller about replacement parts!,"Love the grill, hate DeLonghi's customer service and US parts supply. I ordered a replacement electric plug 6 months ago, and with each inquiry I get exactly the same form letter about it being on backorder. So guard those component pieces like gold -- you don't want to lose them!"
5,DeLonghi BG16 Grill,"Super-pleased with the grill: cooks well and relatively evenly for a small, electrical surface; easy clean up. I can't see doing much cooking on anything other than the highest temperature setting -- perhaps vegetables -- but that setting is perfect for the meats I have grilled. The food even comes off looking like it has been cooked on a true outdoor gas or charcoal grill. Overall, no complaints as it suits my needs (small city apartment) perfectly."
1,Worthless Piece of Junk,"Like so many similar products in the market place, this so called ""grill"" just doesn't get hot enough to cook anything well within a reasonable period of time. Even a fish fillet, where I could produce the attractive grill marks, required finishing in a hot oven to avoid overcooking on this ridiculous device. A chicken breast would take so long that the exterior would be crusted, the interior dry and the diners dead of starvation. One would be much better off with a cheap hibachi or a cast iron grill pan."
1,Innocent or Guilty?,This book is about Archer making it look like he was falsely imprisoned. He takes no responsibility whatsoever for being in prison. He is no doubt an extremely talented writer with an ego to match.
2,only good for learning about conditions in a British prison,"I have read several of Jeffrey Archer's books and, in particular, his short stories which are really good. This book is whiny and has no plot at all. However, it does give a lot of insight into the British prison system. In fact, Archer, being a lord, is not really treated badly at all in comparison to the other prisoners. What is good is that we do learn about their stories, experiences and treatments.I gave this book 2 stars for the knowledge I gained from it, but it's hard to say that I enjoyed it."
2,A Prison Diary - Underwhelming,"Perhaps my expectations were greater from an author with Jeffrey Archer's background and catalog but this book was quite disappointing. For the hours he spent writing about his experience it was a bit underwhelming.Felt they should have either just printed his diary as written, without editing, to give it a more 'captive' flavor or fully edit and make it more interesting and informative. The most intriguing segments were the deeper understanding of the other prisoners.After reading this book, I will NOT be reading the second and third volumes, Purgatory and Heaven, respectively.I look forward to Jeffrey Archer's foray back into fiction."
2,OK,"Archer's linear narrative about his time in a high-security pen is delightful for its outsider's take on maximum security incarceration. The privations therein make for good reading, an education. But couldn't any fresh prisoner with good note-taking skills have written so dryly about 21 days behind bars? The celebrated novelist comes off as polite enough and it's an achievement that such a spoiled man could make so many friends inside. The big failure of ""A Prison Diary"" is that he spends so much time defending himself against his critics, but doesn't so much as acknowledge the crime that actually sent him to jail. Not one word. This was an unforgiveable omission that strangled the otherwise honest effort. All I needed was half a page explaining what, exactly, the crown had charged him with. I would have taken his word if he claimed injustice, but he never even had the grace to do that. To this day, I still don't know anything about his court case."
5,Prison in the UK is not so different from prison in the USA,Lord Archer was committed to prison for an alleged accusation. In his diary he describes things that only someone on the inside can truly know. He is an excellent writer (read some of his novels) and his accounts of prison activities are stunning. Be sure to read his next 2 installments on his time in prison. Open your eyes wide.
3,First of three,I wasn't sure of the circumstances of his imprisonment and have enjoyed his past fiction. I decided to proceed with the other volumes
1,Prison Diary,"I have read several books written by this author and was never dissapointed until this one. It was boring, sorry to say."
1,Upper class Chopper Read,"Jeffrey Archer is no Dostoevsky or Solzhenytsin or even Charriere. He's more an upper class prat Chopper Read.This is a self indulgent whinging bore of a book. Archer and Pauline Hanson would get on famously.Archer's strengths are his ingenious plots, the suspense of the situations he portrays and his interesting characters.This book has none of these elements. If, like me, you are a Jeffrey Archer fan stay away from this book"
3,A good start,This book is a great intro into the world of a balanced Ph diet. It's not something most people usually think about and Joshi gives a good intro and lots of easy to follow sound advice. I did find some contradictory information in the book so you may need to do a little research before embarking on the detox. I did do the detox and felt wonderful...give it a shot you won't be sorry.
2,antisocial diet,"Firstly a diet which cuts out most of the food groups is going to make you lose weight . I found this book really inconsistent , at some points you were reccomended not to eat white rice and then the recepie section has basmati rice galore..(and so on)....i am confused. If you never want to eat out with friends again and make food a serious obsession this book is for you! Joshi tells us to cut out most fruit except bananas- for me this is unnatural. Also anyone who likes their dairy ...this is a big nono. I dont think Josi offers any long term plans here so the weight will proberbly creep back after normality is resumed. crash dieting at its best."
2,It's All Relative,"I keep running into ""detox"" programs that ask me to eat eggs and dairy. I know for people eating a very toxic diet, Dr. Joshi's Holistic Detox is a good way to transition to a truly clean diet. But for those of us looking to be slightly alkaline and highly efficient in our digestion, Dr. Joshi's diet doesn't take us very far. Just know that if you are aspiring to a truly non-toxic diet, Dr. Joshi's diet is only good for trasitioning. To go the rest of the way, read and follow anything by Drs. Robert Young or Gabriel Cousens."
2,This is a terrible version of a once great mouse,"I owned an IBM Optical Scrollpoint Mouse and used it extensively for 3+ years of for my office mouse; doing mostly CAD drafting and modeling. I liked it so much that when it finally died, I tried to replace it. In fact, I ordered two, so that I'd have a spare for future use.The mouse I receive is by Lenovo (IBM spun off it's PC arm to them). The form is the same on this new Lenovo version, but don't be fooled. This mouse is terrible. They have replaced the scroll wheel with a weird toggele switch that is alternately way too sensitive and non-responsive. It is completely non-ergonomic and requires repositioning of your hand to use. Sadly, I am now trying out ergo mice again. Don't make the same mistake I did!"
5,"HIATT, HIATT, HIATT!!!!!","What a treat it was to stumble across this more than deserved tribute to the songs of master songwriter John Hiatt. Right from the top, a (zydeco) version of Falling Up by CJ Chenier, the CD just rocks! While Hiatt has had his songs covered by artists ranging from Paula Abdul (yuck!) to Joan Baez, Iggy Pop, Phil Collins (double-yuck) and Bob Dylan, this tribute leans in more of a blues direction and let me tell you what, it works perfectly! Other faves include Irma Thomas on Old Habits.... and Tab Benoit on Feels Like Rain. Can anyone say volume 2??????"
4,Very Strong Interpretations of Hiatt Songs,"What a delight to find this CD. An Interesting list of artists too, some of which I'd not heard of before. My Personal favorite is Kenny Neals ""Love Like Blood."" This man just keeps getting better. Though maybe Chris Smither's (who?)version of ""real Fine Love is the best cut, his brilliant version is so different from the original. And doing a zydeco version of ""Fallin Up"" was inspired and CJ Chenier just rocks the song. Iread that Hiatt thought Odetta doing was one of his songs was really cool. Overall the choices of songs are very good with a strong emphasis on the Stolen Moments CD, one of Hiatts best albums. If your a Hiatt fan your gonna find these versions very strong, and if your not aware of Hiatt then buy not only this CD to hear some great music, but Hiatts best of CD. Of course you should really own everytthing by this great American songwriter."
4,Fitting Tribute,"Seems some people don't get the idea behind tributes. It's not about trying to outdo the original but to give an interpretation in your own style. For this reason it is a great album, not as strong as the first tribute ""Love Gets Strange"" (a must have) but an enjoyable collection of songs none the less and on a par with the later ""It'll Come To You"". In my opinion all are worth having."
2,Johnnie in decline with dated arrangements and material,"Ray's voice was becoming ragged when these tracks were cut in 1976; it had a acquired a harshness at odds with the shivery whispers that were a large part of his style in the '50s. Complicating things are the bombastic '70s arrangements that only inspire Johnnie to push harder, in some cases with mediocre material like ""Tie A Yellow Ribbon"" (ick!). This will be a tough one for most contemporary listeners to slog through and will give a false impression of Ray's true talents to those not familiar with his best work."
4,Good guide for the tourist planning to visit Xiamen,"My wife and I are planning to visit Xiamen soon and wanted to find out what a tourist might see. This video was just the thing. Two very enthusiastic young locals, a man and woman, take the viewer on a quite professional tour of the sights. It seems exceptionally comprehensive. The production values are not what we're accustomed to on American TV, but then that's all part of the experience. This video is a hoot! We both got a kick out of it. The translation to English in the subtitles is often hilariously amateurish, though the meaning always seems clear. Our favorite line was one of the hosts exhorting the other, ""Don't be so hurry!"""
2,Great original but...,"This CD contains the original title track which has to be one of the greatest pop songs of all time. Unfortunatly Track 1,2,4 and 5 are only dull and unbearable dance remixes that do not follow the romantic spirit of the original. Buy the ""Best of"" CD. Please contact me if you know a source for any great material no longer available."
3,Portable Thermostat,Thermostat works as advertised and is heavy duty.The temperature setting and the cycling of the thermostat is somewhatcourse and hard to control.I would recommend this product despite the course controls.There are very limited choices for this type of product.
2,quits working after it gets hot,It came quickly and I plugged it into a fan to blow hot air out of room worked good for 3 days then on 4th day room got above 90 deg. it just quit working until room cooled off. I guess this unit only works in cold environments!!!!
2,Tolerance (+ -) 5 Degrees,"This portable thermostat was installed in a Sausage Fermentation/Drying Chamber about 2X4X6. This portable thermostat controller controlles a 500 Watt heating element in the very well insullated chamber. I also have an EX-Tech (excellent product) dual Temperature/Humidity remote probe monitor. The best this Portable Thermostat can do is to keep the temterature within plus and minus 5 degrees from target setting. Currently, I set the Portable Thermostat to 49 degrees. The Chamber temperature, which is monitored by the Ex-Tech 445815, goes up to 58 degrees then back down to 48 degrees. I don't know what the ""kick-on and kick off"" (with their respective temperature ""catch up"" lags) actual temperatures are, but you can see the precision of this Portable Thermostat is not good at all.If this unit has internal adjustments for the kick on-off, I am not aware of it and this review would be null."
5,STAY OUT LATE,"If you don't own a Lucky Stars cd yet, you're missing out big times! These guys are the number one maestros of western swing and country. Fantastic composers, professional players, this baby swings from number one to thirteen. Sage Guyton is the wittiest lyricist around, and Jeremy Wakefield the steel guitar guru alive these days. Besides this and the previous Lucky Stars ""Hollywood & Western"", I suggest you also get the solo works of J Wakefield, Biller and Wakefield, and the Bonebrake Syncopatros, featuring most of the Lucky Stars. and don't miss them live, thay're unbelievable!! Get it this moment, join in the fun, this will stand the test of time sharing the platter with all the classics"
3,Very Good CD,"I bought this because Joel Paterson of The Modern Sounds is a fan of these guys and has sat in with them on guitar. The music is authentic classic country sounding, energetic and fun. Lyrics are well written, songs are well constructed. My only problem with both of their CDs that I own is that the recording quality is not first rate, to me it sounds thin and harsh. Maybe that's the way they like it. Their talent level deserves better.Bottom line though, it's a toe tapper and a very good CD. There aren't a whole lot of bands playing country in a classic style, it's refreshing to hear."
3,Another fun western swing album,"Good workman like western swing. Still I think I preferred their ""Hollywood and Western"" album. The later is a tad more fun, and western swing, or so it seems to me, has humour as an inherent element."
2,Don't believe it.,"Okay, I bit the bullet and bought what I thought would be a nice addition to my kitchen. I needed a new toaster and splurged for this one. I have used it to bake corn bread, muffins, 8x8 cakes, etc., (it does a nice job and doesn't heat up the entire kitchen) and to roast a small chicken. It must be a VERY small chicken to fit into this oven. It does a nice job on the chicken if it fits but YOU try to clean the top of this oven after having roasted a chicken in it. And guess what, the warrantee ran out yesterday and one of the knobs broke off it today. How could they have planned such obsolensence so carefully?!"
2,Out it goes !!!,"I used this oven for about a year before it started losing parts -- the function button (bake, broil, toast, etc)to be exact. Prior to that, the door would not close completely. Then one day it did. HooRay !!! It's also a nasty little thing because it is so difficult to clean. And the toast (or whatever) closest to the convection fan always cooks more quickly than the rest. It still works -- on bake only -- as that is where it was set when the knob broke off. I intend to chuck it in the trash and look for another brand."
4,"love it, hate it it's expensive to fix","I've had my airstream oven for 4 1/2 years.I love the convection feature...it makes the meat turn out moistalmost like a rotisserie. It's a great oven for just plain baking too.BUT it is difficult to clean if you don't do it regularly. My husband likes to have hot toast and this oven toasts, but at the end of the toast cycle the toast is barely warm, not warm enough to melt butter. You cannot stop the toast cycle. We bought a cheap $1.00 toaster at a garage sale for toasting bread. ALSO: the elements in my oven have arched up, looking bent so that I can no longer get the lower rack in one of the positions. I had replaced on lower element year ago and it cost $20.00 plus service charge because you cannot replace it yourself without breaking it. Now my oven door gets stuck slightly open and we can't figure out why. I Love this oven's convection feature,but it is high maintenence !"
4,"Simple, low-tech, and wonderful!","If you're looking for a digital appliance, with timers and auto-this and auto-that, than you're looking at the wrong oven. However, if you want something that packs a lot of good uses in a relatively small space, this is it. I've roasted chickens, defrosted frozen items, made small pizzas, re-heated pizza slices (vastly superior to microwaving!), baked rolls, cooked small casseroles, and I'm very pleased. The only thing it can't do (at least not to my satisfaction) is toast bread, but that's just a fact about all ""toaster""-ovens I've ever used. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the first one I received was damaged (clearly at the factory, not during shipping), and the door on its replacement occasionally requires a tap on one of its hinges when shutting it, or it won't shut completely (I'll fix that, one of these days....) But, all things considered, it's well worth its place on my kitchen counter."
5,I love It,"I received one for Christmas over 4 years ago and it is still going strong. The door started sticking about a year ago, but my husband easily remedied that problem. I am a professional chef and at home cooking just for two I turn on my Delonghi before I think about turning on my full size oven. You can finish meats or fish that has been seared on the stove top, bake small batches of cookies, Roast chicken and even reheat pizza perfectly. My only complaint is the inside is not as easy to clean as I would like, But I also use the oven at least once a day and have cooked all sorts of meats that have splattered grease on the inside. So this might not affect a normal user.I highly reccomend this to any person who cooks a lot but for a samll number of people."
2,"Susan of Northbrook, Illinois",Great oven while it works-then a disaster! Knob broke off and oven door will not close-both are problems which I see other customers also had. Would not buy DeLonghi product again. Poor quality-made to last only a couple years.
5,Works Great! Don't be scared off by the naysayers,"This is the second DeLonghi oven I have purchased. My first one was purchased at a flea market 7 years ago, and it still works great! I retired it and bought a new one, so my husband could take the older model to his office to use there.The AS690 works exactly as advertised. I made toast this morning and it worked beautifully - actually better than the older one. The convection process works like a charm. I do a lot of cooking with my countertop toaster oven - I rarely need to use the large stove oven anymore. You can also purchase a dehydrator kit directly from DeLonghi if you're so inclined. This will be my next DeLonghi purchase.If you want a high quality product that's built to last, go with this item."
1,A true hunk of garbage,"This product seemed to fall apart the very first day of use. Soon after purchasing, two knobs broke off and the convection fan started to whine. Avoid at all costs."
3,For Joshua Slocum fans,"Its an easy read, however, speaks mostly about the boat - Spray - itself. I would have liked to have more insights about sailing as a family than about Joshua Slocum and his boat Spray. Still, a friendly read."
4,Not like Slocum's but still entertaining,"I really enjoyed the story of the Bernardin family's voyage even though it was quite a bit different than I expected. I guess I thought it would cover the exact route as the original Spray (instead of Cape Horn they went through the Panama canal) and I assumed the Spray would not have an engine (but it did.) I thought there would be some exciting moments of drama (but here was very little, depending on your definition.) Even so, it was a very enjoyable read and a good voyaging and family story."
4,tramontina deluxe stainless steel fondue,I haven't used it as yet. I am waiting for a christmas party--it is very pretty and I can not wait to use it. I wish it had the ceramic insert to warm cheese and chocolate. I have been looking for an insert but I haven't found one yet. The insert would make it absolutely perfect.
3,It's not Bernstein and never will be,"Tilson Thomas flirted briefly with trying to be the next Bernstein -- he makes a specialty of Bernstein's music and even took over the Young People's Concerts in NY for a time, a signature Bernstein event -- but luckily he has gone his own way. He is not a fiery or ebullient conductor. One can't say of him that he is possessed by music, a phrase Bernstien used about himself. MTT's strengths are elegance, attention to detail, and an ability to relate on friendly terms with his musicians as equal colleagues.In these Copland recordings he certainly conducts well, but the bumptious populist spirit of Copland seems lost among the careful detailing. This should be simple music to conduct but somehow only Bernstein catches the rollicking joy, the democratic dance rhythms, and the underlying sophistication at the same time. These readings strike me as too civilized by half, although they are in great sound."
5,"truly angelic..""Love at the 5 and dime""is heaven sent.","so often live recordings lose the original recording's luster.nanci griffith has with beautiful grace and form not only disproven this,she has taken what honest love for her art she has to a new level.from the wonderfully spoken intro to""..5 and dime"" to the american gothic of""trouble in the fields"",a true classic.if ever you have the chance to see this blessed and genuine artist in concert..go!!til then..enjoy""..summer evening""."
5,One of my ten favorite CD's of all time,"If you think you don't like music with folk or country themes, try this album. Ms. Griffith confidently walks a line between folk and pop without worrying how her music will be categorized. Her voice is expressive, her words powerful and wonderful. If you only know her later albums, you know about her unending curiousity for good literature, and historical and world events. But this earlier album deals with a simpler and sweeter time. It's a Hard Life Wherever You Go is an homage to her grandparents. Other songs, such as Once in a Very Blue Moon, Looking for the Time, and Red Brick Floor are simply a lot of fun.Buy this CD today. Nanci Griffith has many terrific albums in her lexicon. But how she manages to connect with a live audience is something special. Fourteen years after hearing this album for the first time, it still charms me, just as I am sure it did the folks at Andersen Fair in Texas, who saw her live."
2,Disappointed,I bought this CD looking for a particular song. This is a live recording and the sound quality of the spoken parts is very bad; you cannot hear what she says. The sound of the music is much better than that except that the song I wanted had some very quiet parts that were hard to hear. I will try to resell this CD.
5,Playring Review,"My cats favor toy. These are very difficult to get in local stores so I was thrilled when I found these at Amazon.com. My cats love carrying these around the house in their mouth and talking like they have prey. Also great watching them pounch and bat them around. Fun for all cats, all ages."
5,kitty loves,I had no idea my cat would love something so cheap. These are lots of fun and are not dangerous to cats or humans. I'm very pleased with this purchase.
5,The new favorite toy,"My cats love these. I had a hunch they would, because they are always taking off with the little plastic lids on juice containers. These are so simple and inexpensive, yet they provide a lot of entertainment. Both cats are 9 months old, and they play with these on their own, with each other, or with me. They play both on the carpet and on the slick kitchen floor. They drop them at my feet so that I will throw them and they retrieve them, they bat them around, they carry them upstairs and bat them around in the empty bathtub. They drop them in my shoes, boots, and purse. I find them in their water dishes. I only bought one package to begin with, because I never know for sure what they will like, but I recently found them at the pet supply and bought three more packages, because these are the new favorite toy."
1,Aren't these just milk rings?,These look just like the rings from plastic jugs after you unscrew the tops. Our cats play with milk rings all over the house.
5,A hit!,I have two cats and one cat is not interested in these at all but the other cat LOVES these! I wish I ordered more bc they have all disappeared since she plays with them so much!
1,Cut up paper towel roll works better,"Save your money for other toys. Cut up a paper towel roll into about 1/2 pieces. Your cat will love it and when you step on it, you won't hurt your foot!"
4,I can't keep enough of these around for my cat!,"My younger cat plays with these constantly! He carries, throws, bats, attacks and does anything he can with these. Hardwood, tile, even carpet because he can still roll them. The only problem I have is that he chews them up within a week (not to mention me stepping on one in the middle of the night)."
4,Nice and simple,"These are a good buy if you have hard floors. My cats will always run after them if I skim them across the floor, and will flip them and play with them by themselves"
2,I don't like these and neither do my cats.,My two year old cats love the spring toys and will pick them up and carry them around all over the place. Naturally when I saw these I thought they might like them as well. WRONG! They batted them around for about thirty seconds and then walked away. They have been laying in the same place for a couple of weeks now. I have tried to engage them with these toys and it is a no-go. Another note: the springs get strewn all over the house and even in bare feet don't hurt when you step on them but these toys HURT if you accidentally step on one barefooted. The ones I purchased are going to a friend with two cats to see if hers will play with them.
2,These were a waste of money.,"We have 4 indoor cats and none of them bother to play with these. They actually ignore them! They looked so tempting in the ad, but one would think that at least one of the cats would take an interest in them. I'm putting them in the donations bag for our resale shop"
2,What a hype!,"After reading the reviews about Cat Crazies, I thought my kitten would love them. Boy, was I wrong! He played with them for about 15 seconds and then lost interest.I was also disappointed when I saw them. I thought they would be soft, pliable plastic but they are just pieces of hard, colored plastic. The shipping for this item cost me more than the item itself!I advise you to save your money and not waste it on these unexciting, little cat toys. Just take two twistie ties that come with plastic bags, wind them together in the middle, curl up the ends and throw it down on the floor. My 4-month-old kitten never tires of playing with this ""free"" toy, much more than he played with the Cat Crazies."
2,My cat didn't really go for these,My cats didn't go for these. I think because they don't move on their own. The cat springs are much preferable as they move continuously when the cat takes a swat at them.
4,My cat's favorite toy,My cat loves these and will play with them for hours. She'll even play fetch with them if she's in the right mood. The only negative thing I can say about them is they go under the stove and couch too easily.
1,Clunky and filled with filler,"Such a disappointment.This book feels like a high school book report, where Mann has a certain number of words he has to write, so he comes up with filler to pad out the actual content. This includes sidebars listing other hits from the same year, quotes from commenters on websites like Amazon, and worst of all, lists of compilation albums on which the song appears.It wouldn't be so bad if Mann's writing style was engaging, but it's clunky, wooden and padded with fluff. ""What do song X, song Y and song Z have in common? They're all one-hit wonders from 19XX!""A better title, although covering a wider, different range of songs, isThe Billboard Book of Number One Hits."
2,Mushroom Log,Bought this as a gift for my folks last Christmas. Grew a few mushrooms. The bottom line is that this is for someone who is home often and can really care for it...like a pet. Not for anyone going on vacation or out of town for more than a few days in a stretch.
5,A Tool For Empowerment,"This CD has not only helped me, but anyone that I have recommended it to, also. Donnie McClurkin has a gift for reaching people through song - if you are in need for a push towards walking with the righteous, or encouragement to 'get back in line' - this is the CD to do it. Listen with an OPEN HEART...and God will walk on in. Enjoy..."
5,A Man After God's Own Heart,"This album speaks to me in God's voice. My favorite song is ""We Fall Down, But We Get Up"". It reminds us when we are weak and are tempted to give up,to get up and embrace God's mercy and grace.This is highly recommended to those who think that is it too late to get close to God's heart.Thank You Pastor McClurkin for inspiring us to stick close to God."
5,"Awesome Praise, Repentance, Worship Music","Donnie McClurkin does it again! This time even better. This cd ushers you into the presence of the Lord. This is a must have! You will Praise God, Repent before the Lord, and You will worship Him! I am glad to see there is still Gospel Music that can usher you in the presence of the Most High!"
4,Caribbean Praise Medley!!!,"The system wouldn't let me purchase the one song, so I had to get the entire project. I haven't listened to the rest of it, STILL! The Medley was worth the full purchase, alone! So I'm ten years late. Good music remains good music and the Word will NEVER pass away!"
5,A MEGA-ANOINTING ON A MEGA ARTIST,"This CD is AWESOME. I'm not usually a fan of Live Concerts but this ministers to you in such a way that you are not occupied with the audience. Pastor McClurkin is truly utilizing the gifts that the Lord has given him. I listen to this CD several times throughout the workday and it keeps me going, going, going.... WE FALL DOWN ministers to the brokeness in us while songs like JUST FOR ME and THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE restore the optimism we so desperately need these day. I especially appreciate the lighter side of Pastor McClurkin in the CARRIBEAN MEDLEY. Some saints take themselves so seriously -- its refreshing to see others worship the LORD with gladness in their hearts and a sense of humor. This is great ""driving music"" too. I encourage you to order NOW. Continue to be blessed Pastor McClurkin -- you've been a such a blessing to us!"
5,AWESOME,"This CD is an experience of a lifetime. I've never before found a CD that speaks to all the phases of my life. Whatever place I find myself, I can find song that addresses the issue. It is a wonderful tool for ministering to self and others with whom I have shared this music. ""I'll Tust you Lord,"" helps us to understand that the choices we make in life are not always easy even when serving God. ""Psalm 27"" is soothing and speaks of the desires of the heart.This CD has been a light to my path! I hope that we will continue to hear from Pastor McClurkin for years to come."
5,SPIRIT FILLED,"THIS IS A VERY SPIRIT FILLED CD.IT REALLY GIVE A SPIRIT FILLED LIFT.IT HAS MADE ME TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT MY RELATIONSHIP WITH THE LORD,IT HAS HELPED ME TO STAY IN THE WORD.NO MATTER HOW I MAY BE FEELING, I CAN POP IN DONNIE'S CD AND JUST LIKE THAT MY STRENGHT IS RENEWED."
5,Fulfilling,"This is my first D. McClurkin CD, i was familiar with his song stand and purchased this new one. it is excellent. It has a little flavor for every style you might like. It is very popular with young adults and also speaks volumes to adults. i reccommend it strongly."
5,Elder Donnie is truly Annointed,The man is the bomb! Plain and simple. He has no problem in letting you know that the Lord has truly touched him. He sings from his soul and it shows through this CD and his previous ones. Everybody can relate to We fall Down. Also I love That's What I believe. I love this type of music. It makes you think about alot of things about life. A great CD to pick up.
5,One of The Best Gospel CDs I've EVER Heard!,"This CD came out not long after I got saved. I was still becoming familiar with Gospel music. It ended up being one of the first two CDs that was burned for me. I love the songs on this CD so much. I soon became convicted of owning a burned CD; ""a burned Gospel CD"" at that. I broke it, threw it in the trash, and went to buy the real CD. And to this day, I haven't heard too many Gospel CDs I am blessed by as much as this one."
3,Loving it,I had been looking for this CD for a while now and glad to finally have it. I am thoroughly enjoying it.
5,Tons of easy vegan recipes!,"This is the vegetarian/vegan cookbook I use most often with the highest success rate (100%) of all other cookbooks I own. Vegan Vittles was my first encounter with veganism and is one of the reasons I ""went vegan"". Joanne did a wonderful job of putting this cookbook together."
5,Excellent cookbook!,"This is one of the best cookbooks I own, and I own MANY!! The recipes are so easy to follow, and everything I have tried tastes even better than I imagined. I highly recommend this book."
3,Very Informative,"I found the stories in this book to be very touching. If you are in doubt about being vegetarian, get a hold of this book - you will find yourself new and improved! And this is a recipe book!"
4,"Easy to Use, Good Food!","While the recipes aren't gourmet, they are good home cooking. I find I use this book often and have enjoyed 99% of the recipes in the book. I would recommend this book to anyone."
3,"Decent, but far from the best","This cookbook contains some useful information for new vegans, such as a list of substitutes for some common non-vegan ingredients, an ingredient glossary, and some helpful tips on preparation techniques (e.g. how to press tofu). However, this information is available elsewhere, and many of the recipes aren't too exciting. I enjoyed some of them -- the marinades are very good and are versitile, and the ""ricotta"" for the unstuffed shells has a wonderful flavor. However, many are not as good as those available in other cookbooks or free on the internet, and some recipes are downright bad (I found a number of the soup recipes lacking in flavor, and one had an awful gravy-like texture). Better recipes for pumpkin pie, chili, muffins, and many other things are available at sites like www.vegweb.com and from other books."
3,Culinary Brain Surgery,"This book doesn't fail in providing varied, delicious recipes, but I don't reccomend it unless you can spare (and enjoy spending) hours preparing and cooking these recipes; and unless you are an experienced and well-versed vegan. Some of the recipes call for ingredients which are intimidating or just plain inaccessible for some new vegans, while others require impractical purchases which cannot be used in other recipes. When I have the time for the preparation these recipes require, I definitely refer to this book for tofu marinades and gravies. The mushroom stroganoff is delectable as well. Bottom line: if want simple, inexpensive, quick meals to produce at the end of your busy day, this book is probably not for you."
4,Just what I wanted,"This is a great camera. Photo quality is excellent. Battery life is excellent. And I loved the onscreen stuff - it is as good as any I've seen.The optical zoom is not as great as it could be, but that is a minor issue. Some of the other reviews have complained about that, but that's not reasonable. You don't buy a camera like this for it's zoom. You buy it for photo quality, capacity, and battery life. This camera has all three in good measure.The price is a good one for this type of camera. If you are looking for a great 3.1 MP camera, you could do a lot worse."
3,Great for the first year or two.,"We got our camera as a gift about two years ago. We LOVED it, while it worked. It's easy to use and takes great quality pictures. Lately it drains batteries, in less then two minutes. We're really bummed. So I guess we are in the market for a new camera. If you purchase this camera, get the extended warranty."
2,Looking for some weight.,"Looking for a quick point/shoot to go with my Olympus E/20, I bought the CX6330. I shot a few pics and was not disappointed at all by the image quality. However the light weight and cheap plastic feel really got to me. So I returned it for a Canon A60 and very glad I did. If you don't mind the disposable camera feel get the Kodak for the image quality."
1,"Expensive ""disposable"" cameras","We had this camera just over a year when it quit working; of course, it happened on a big trip to Italy. This camera never did take particularly good photos; the auto focus was always hit or miss and you can't even think about using it in any situation even approaching low light. The lenses assembly finally locked for good when the camera was just weeks out of warranty. We had the same exact problem, twice, with a more expensive Kodak LS443. From reviews of these two Kodak products, I can only conclude that this is a known weakness with Kodak digital cameras that the company is either unwilling or unable to correct. My advice to potential buyers is to steer clear of Kodak products."
2,perhaps I had a dud....,"I bought this camera after reading reviews, looking for something that I could produce decent 4 x 6 photos. Just like the other reviewers said, the camera is easy to learn to use, and the colors were bright. But when I had them printed as 4x6 photos, I noticed that there was sort of a thin dark line outlining the people in the pics. I know it's not the developers either, because I can see that little line on the video screen of the camera, as well as when I viewed it on the computer. So, this camera is being returned soon."
4,CX6330 When Kodak was still making a great camera,"I know a lot of people have had complaints about Kodak easyshare cameras, but I have had mine for 6 or 7 years and it is still going strong. This camera has traveled to many places and I have been pleased with just about every picture it has taken. The one thing I don't like is the size, it is bulky. It is easy to use and you don't have to read the entire instruction manual to know how to use it."
4,Great quality of pictures,"This camera I own for two years. The pictures of this camera were excellent. We took the pictures during night time at Niagra Waterfalls, pictures came so good.Nice features of camera:Excellent resoultion and quality; good at night shots; date imprint feature, NTSC/PAL TV output; able to print 8X10 size without loosing quality;But after using two years it start giving the problems, it's not holding the battery for not even two photos. I given the camera for repair at CompUSA. They replaced couple of parts and working fine for few days. Later it totally stop working even though you load full charged batteries. The camera power light blink and it stops. Anyhow, it's not working now. I suggest to take extended warranty from store for this camera to overcome these kind of problems."
4,Excellent Camera!,"I love this camera. It has almost every feature I could want. The only feature it doesn't have is a built-in speaker, so you can't hear your movies until you download them onto a computer or tv. This has not been a problem for me, though, since I rarely use that feature. It takes FANTASTIC pictures. I bought the Printer/Dock 6000 with it. It is the best combination ever made! I can take photos and ""develop"" them in seconds! I use it all the time! I am now known as the picture taker in our circle of friends, and they love that I can give them photos instantly."
1,Lemon of a camera,Camera works for about a year and 1/2 then bites the dust with a E 45 error. Kodak customer service is the worst they have consumer advocates who do not care about customers. They try to make $$$ monies over and above when camera has problems.Stay away from Kodak products unless you only want a Digital camera that lasts a year or do.Poor product.
1,-_-,Bought the camera thinking my first digital camera would be great!... Proven wrong since it doesn't quite like close-ups nor like 50 ft away pics either. What a shame and what a waste of over 400+ considering my sister got the same thing (twin) and we got the dock.
5,Very glad I bought it,"This is the first digital camera I have purchased. So far I am quite satisfied. I like that the controls are easy to use and understand and find the software very useful. I also purchased the printer dock and have to say the prints are as good as anything you'd get with a 35mm. My only dislikes are the slow time between photos (though all have this to my knowledge) and the general size of it. It's definitely not the smallest on the market, but at the same token, the size makes for comfortable picture taking.All in all, I am very pleased with this camera."
1,Ran out of gas,"I purchased my Kodak digital about a year ago. 90% of all shots taken were very good to excellent. In less than a year it has been in the shop twice now. Picture quality is much worse. Sometimes it won't focus. Some times the picture is severely underexposed (even with the flash firing automatically).I'm very dissappointed. And Kodak has never returned a call. Best Buy, where I purchased, is an absolute pain. Never again. Maybe a canon. I've also heard similar complaints about Sony digitals."
2,Is Mine Just a Lemon?,"Upon receipt of this camera, I was highly satisfied, great pictures, easy use, etc.. One month later the lense would not retract unless I would turn it on and off. The next time I used it one month later, the lense would not retract at all. I called Kodak support, they were very nice, but said that the only thing I can do at this point is send it in for repair, at my expense, of course. I just sent it and won't know the outcome for a couple of weeks. I find it irritating that as much as today's electronics cost, and after using it for a total of eight days, they only repair it and not replace it with a new one. Alas, such is the world of customer service today."
1,Humidity or bodily contact may corrode camera!,"Had this camera for 4 months when it stopped working while taking a picture during a hike in the Caribbean. Kodak said there was corrosion throughout the camera, thus voiding the warranty. They refused to fix the camera even though we had never had the camera in contact with water or used it abnormally. We think there's a design flaw or manufacturing defect in the camera housing that allows humidity or moisture from human contact to penetrate camera. Beware! Kodak will not help you in any manner and now we're out a camera and $200."
2,Not a very good camera,"This camera lasted me a couple years but I can't wait to get a new one. The picture quality is frustrating, especially when you're trying to use a flash. Plus, the battery runs out EXTREMELY fast no matter how long you charge. I wouldn't recommend it."
2,don't buy,I've had this camera for a couple of years now. I can't wait to get a new one. The battery life on this camera is next to nothing. I go through about 4 batteries a day if I'm taking a lot of pictures. The quality of the pictures isn't ver good either. The flash tends to drown people out after a while. Spend the extra money to get a better quality camera.
1,"Easy, but lack quality","This camera is very easy to use, and the software is simple but the picture quality is poor. The picture are over exposed and you can't set the ISO. Everything is automatic. The color tend to be on the pink side therefore making the picture inaccurate. I now have a Pentax Optio 30 and am very happy about it......"
1,HORRENDOUSS!,horrible camera!doesnt even deserve one star!!contains sand in inner lense!the screen is so small i cant see it!the battry life is horrible....DONT BUY THIS THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER BETTER CAMERS THAN THIS ONE!!!please listen to my great advice or you will regret your purchasee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Teen Pop At Its Best,"This is a great collection of teen pop from the late 80's. I really like all the songs and think this is a fun CD to listen to. My favorite songs are ""Toy Soldiers"" by Martika, ""If Wishes Came True"" by Sweet Sensation, and ""Two of Hearts"" by Stacy Q."
4,Cooool!,"I origionally only wanted this cuz I really wanted a cd with Vanilla Ice's ""Ice Ice Baby"" without having to get a cd like monsters of rap with some bad old school rappers I knew I pry wouldnt like, so yeah teen riot youll pry like it if ur one of those girl riots ya know with the boy bands and stuff,Im not exactly one anymore, but yeah, NKOTB R also good too!"
4,Does what it's suppose to do,"I bought this for melting chocolate and it did great. The groove on the top layer was a pain in the butt to clean once chocolate sets in there. When I'm not using it to work chocolate, it makes a great pot for making ramen."
2,Smaller than 2qt,"It is a nice double boiler, but it is not 2qt. It looked small when it arrived so I tried to put 2qt of water in it. It would not hold it and overflowed."
4,Eternally Useful,"My mother always cooked perfect rice in this and now I'm enjoying its handling of sensitive foods like chocolate too. The additional 2 qt. bottom is helpful in a busy kitchen, but my reservation in 5 star placement is due to the remnant, scalding stains of boiled water which make the pan look ugly inside. If you can get past that it seems to work fine, although my Mother's always looked like some of the interior coating had worn away too. Therein other remnants might float in food cooked below?"
3,Lightweight but ok,An okay pan duo. The balance could be better both on the burner and when holding the handle to pour.
3,Chintzy handle the major downfall,"The base of the double boiler has a quality feel, but the plastic pot handles at side and top are the cheapest products imaginable with little heat protection and poor feel. Seems like such a mismatch compared to the quality of the base. I bought the set to replace a similar-sized Anolon unit I had for years. The base of that unit had been dropped and dented. In the end, I kept the top and insert of the old unit and kept only the bottom of the new Farberware piece. That way, I kept a clear top that enables vision inside -- very important -- and got rid of two of the three poor quality handles. Of course, by keeping only one of three parts, the good price no longer seems so good. But as long as I remember to hold a potholder, my problem's solved."
4,Just what I wanted,"I was looking for a simple double boiler for occasional items, this fits well and works well enough for how often I use it. Not quite as heavy as expected, but since it's not one of my primary pieces, not too worried about it."
5,perfect little double boiler!,I use this as a double boiler and also use the bottom pan every day. Good piece of equipment to add to your kitchen!
2,Disappointing,"Though I love the turn and pull alarm along with the excellent night illumination, this watch is simply too fragile for all but the lightest uses. Also, the alarm tone tends to disappear and all of a sudden, you have no alarm. Like most of the lower end Timex watches, the painted surfaces disappear after some time, and the Velcro band frays. Simply too disposable for my taste. If you do buy it, get the extended warranty."
3,Timex Reef Gear Watch,"I have owned several Timex Reef Gear watches and they are my favorite sport watch. It is the one watch that I can read in the middle of the night with the lights out! With it's large clock and Indiglo feature I can read it without my glasses. I like to use the dual alarm feature which is especially usefull when traveling. I also like the fact that I can leave it on while swimming and snorkeling so I can keep track of the time. You do have to be careful not to drop this watch because the outer ring can break off, it still worked but didn't look as good. I was disappointed when I could not find it in the stores any longer but very happy that I can still find it at Amazon.com."
3,Timex,"I returned this watch to the Amazon Return Center after reviewing the watch when I received the package and then calling the Timex World headquarters.It seems this watch is labeled in the various choice menus as a""Reef Gear"" brand(style)watch but when I received the watch the style name had changed to 'Expedition', since 'Reef Gear' is no longer marketed. The watch according to the stock number is suppose to be the same but comparing it to my own older ""Reef Gear' watch (same stock)number, it is not exactly the same. I did purchase the older style from an independent retailer listed on [...]. This one was just what I was looking to buy."
4,One step to love,"Mike McTavish was a bit slow on the uptake, he had no idea that his orphaned twin niece (Laura) and nephew (Matthew) were being treated badly by Caroline, even though other people had told him what she was like, he thought they were judging her because of her father, but she was a chip off of the old block(head).It made me wonder if he had a permanent memory loss as to how his parents were when he was a child.The twins run away at the beginning of the book, because Caroline (Mike's bride-to-be)cut Laura's hair, Matthew had turned shy because he had lost his parents, his home, and now they where being mistreated by Caroline at every turn.Mike didn't notice this, but it took Erin O'Connell only a few minutes to not only understand the kids fears but just what they were up against.So Erin went to battle."
4,"Great toy, but some of the parts are hard to work","We purchased this for my son for his 5th birthday. He loves it, plenty of little gadgets to keep him occupied for hours. The only problem is that this did not come with any instructions (and none available on the manufacturer's website) and there are some things we can't figure out. The bed comes off but is difficult and would need an adults assistance. The forklift is supposed to stay on the back but we can't figure how to keep it on. Otherwise, this is very well built, solid material, and great for a 5 year old.(My son's response when the forklift wouldn't stay on the back: it's ok Mom, it can ride on top) :)"
3,"Good, but not great.","Our 4 year old loves trucks and while he does like this one he doesn't love it. However, he does love the forklift. I have a few complaints about it: 1. the forklift doesn't attach on the back (frustrationing for a 4 yr old). 2. The forklift prongs probably won't last long. Had to tell son it's fragile. 3. The side flaps are difficult for a child to operate. I have been trying to talk my son into letting me cut them off as I see little use for them."
4,for my truck fanatic 3 yr old son,My son has so many different trucks/cars from all makes and models. I wanted him to try out this brand. It's realistic in all it's featured and details. Not the most durable so I'd recommend for older kids (bought it before my son was 3 and already some broken parts but he earned this with a sticker chart so he's free to as he likes). I just like the sheer size of it. I would buy more Bruder toy trucks.
2,Not if you want detailed explanations of trimwork....,"I'm a big fan of Fine Homebuilding and Fine Woodworking so I figured this was a great opportunity to capture some very useful information on ""how to"" (as the book is billed) install trim work. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED. The book's articles are dated (pneumatic nail gun review from several years ago!) and not all apply to trim work. To make matters worse, there are not too many detailed tips to actually use. Just short articles which merely touch on the subjects. Definitely not worth the money if you're looking for any sort of ideas or lessons on finish carpentry."
5,Essential reading,"While I'm quite comfortable with the technical side of directing, I've always been a bit unsure of working with actors. This book has answered a lot of my questions, it is insightful and goes into a lot of detail into the best ways of dealing with actors; equipping the reader with the tools he needs to grow in this area.I'd definitely recommend this book. To be honest if you'r reading through these reviews trying to make up your mind if you need it or not, I'd advise you just to buy it. At worst you've got a good reference book that can provide you with some solutions to problems you might encounter, at best you're going to own something that could very well change the way you think about motivating actors."
4,Director Beware,"A practical, technique oriented introduction to directing actors. It's really from an actor's perspective, and has a very condescending attitude toward directors. But this is useful. The anecdotes are really enjoyable. Not a substitute for acting and directing experience, just one set of possible tools to try to put into practice. Harold Clurman's ""On Directing"" is of the same aesthetic perspective, but at the same time broader and more succinct, and more sympathetic to directors."
5,Best book on directing I've seen,"I'm an independent director and this book really revolutionized my thinking about working with actors. I've applied the approach and techiques in the books after reading it a couple of times over the past two years and have been amazed at how well it works.In listening to DVD commentaries of various directors and watching other directors work, it's pretty clear that Judith Weston has tremendous insight it how to create that memorable performance.This book is a must for any aspiring director or director that wants to be a ""actors director""."
2,Not what I expected,"The book is all over the place. VERY subjective reading. I did not find much practical use for it. I purchased the book based on the reviews, but was greatly disappointed. I felt it was self indulgent and wordy."
3,A FEW THINGS,"The book offered a few good concepts regarding the interaction between directors and actors.It seemed to be a little heavy on the philosophy.It gave many great examples and explanations on how to talk to actors with certain type words.I would have to say that was the heart of the book, developing a certain way to talk with actors."
5,Excellent book for all directors,"As a sometime actor and an occasional director, I found this book to be a great aid in helping me to reconcile the two crafts. It provides a common ground and a universal language so that directors and actors can communicate with each other.I recommend it for any director who wants to know how to inspire the actors in his production to deliver their best possible performances."
5,Powerful techniques,"For anyone confused by all the 'methods' of directing and coaching performances, Judith Weston's book is a bible that compiles the most useful and fruitful of all techniques...it's a little Uta Hagen, a little Stella Adler, a little Sanford Meisner and Stanislavski. But a more accessible reference.Her premises and methods are so clear, they can be grasped by actors or non actors. Use the book as a text, a reference, or an encyclopedia of quick fixes."
1,review of Timex Ironman Watch,"This is usually a reliable watch, but I've had it less than 5 weeks and the light function is already not working. I don't know if this is manufacturer problem or the seller."
1,4th unit returned defective,"First two came in with dead battery. We bought replacement batteries and changed them out. Each started to exhibit erratic behavior, either not beeping at all or just beeping uncontrollably for no apparent reason. One would reset itself daily. Exchanged these two for a replacement pair to the same effect: dead battery and periodic resets and uncontrolled random beeping. Going to look elsewhere. It is a real shame, a great watch for our two young kids if it had only worked. Save your money, it appears to be a defective batch of watches they are trying to move, or maybe grey market items, who knows, but four out of four defective should should encourage everyone to look elsewhere."
1,Doesn't work,"Update: if I change the battery it voids the waterproof. Changed my rate to a 1 star, returning the watch and will find this model else where.Well:1. The watch does not work. I saw this happened to someone else but chalked it up to a fluke. Taking it to have a new battery put it and it better work.2. Fits my 11 year old perfectly who it was intended for which earned it a 2 star status. Otherwise it would have been 1 star.3. He is upset BECAUSE IT CAME IN THE MAIL NOT WORKING.I'm not sending it back YET b/c it is near impossible to find an Ironman (not iron kids) watch to fit my little guy so we are trying a new battery. Can you tell I am appalled? I didn't read any fine print that said it would be a watch that has stopped working or would need a new $10.00 battery. grrrr."
2,Too small,"I may have missed something in the description, but I thought that this was a man's watch. It's not. I'd even say that it's on the small side for a woman. Might be a good size for a pre-teen."
1,NO BATTERY!!!,"I bought two of these watches for my sons but they came with no battery. Actually, they came with a worn off battery. I had both repaired, but even with a new battery one of them had no nightlight."
1,Boo...,"Ordered this for my 9 year old step son. He was super excited to receive it, but when it got there, it did not work. No lights, nothing.I didn't want to chance buying a new battery and having it ""work"" for a few days and then go bad, so I immediately sent it back.Bummer, because he had an Ironman kid's watch at one point and loved it, and this one was a decent price."
1,Worst purchase in amazon. Could not believe amazon is a fraud,I bought this watch and lots of other stuffs all the way from Nigeria and it was shipped to my friend on a course in USA only to get it back home here in Nigeria to find out that I was duped by amazon.1. The watch is a kids watch2. Cant fit any body's wrist even a woman3. The battery is DEAD. I can not believe it!4. The manual is for the wrong watchI will keep this watch to Remind me to never shop in amazon ever again and to always remember that fraud is not only done by Nigerians as the western world tries to portray
4,Simple sport's watch,"I have been using Timex Ironman watches for years and they have never let me down. I really like the Indiglo feature and the simple navigation between timer and clock settings. If I forget to take it off before getting into the shower or jumping into a lake, it's no big deal and the band is flexible and moves well with me throughout my adventures.Trivial as it sounds, I love the bright blue band that this particular watch came with.There is only one issue that I've found so far with this watch and that is the various button locations. On this watch, start/stop is the easiest button to find (lower center) and Indiglo is on the side, top right. I wish the two were switched. When you're in the dark trying to see what time it is, it's obviously preferable to have Indiglo be the front and center button."
1,Light function disrupts watch,"Received watch for $18 from the seller River Road. I had the same problem as a previous poster - every time I pressed the Indiglo light button on, the screen would light up for a second and then the watch would go completely blank for 10 seconds. In normal operation, the light should turn on for three to five seconds without any disruption of the display screen. This is inexcusable and warrants a one-star from me. I will be returning it very soon."
4,Good Moisturizer,I have natural 4b hair and I like this a lot. I don't like the way it makes my hands feel (but I'm very peculiar on how I want my hands to feel) It doesn't dry my hair out and a lot goes a long way. I can find it in other stores (cheaper at that) and it keeps my hair soft all day.
3,Black Relaxed Hair,A little goes a long way with this. My hair is relaxed and this is a water based moisturizer so I only use this when my hair is really dry. If my hair is freshly flat ironed I will not use this because it will puff it up.
3,conditioning lotion,its a great conditioning lotion. i like it better than the other leading brand of hair lotions
1,Garbage,"This cover just does not stay put and therefore defeats the entire purpose of protecting your seats from mud and paw scratches from your pet. It has very slick underside and constantly needs readjustment on my leather sits as it glides whichever way my dog moves. Because of that it also makes my dog unstable while in a car as on every turn it shifts in a direction car takes it and so shifts the dog with it, forcing him to lose his balance. It may perform better in compact cars with fabric seats but I would not recommend to buy this cover if you have large seats and especially if you have leather seats."
2,Not-so-great Heavy Metal,"These scissors are heavy, metal, and unbelievably dull. The workmanship that went into producing these scissors can best be described as mediocre. But it's the dullness of the blades that bothers me most. I've bought numerous pairs of scissors and shears through the years and these are the worst I've seen in a long time. If there was an attempt to sharpen these at the factory, it must have been fairly halfhearted one. I am disappointed. Maybe I'll like them better after I sharpen them."
1,Not as advertised on web site,"I was ordering these ""Wescott"" shears for my mother for Christmas. What I received was a generic ""Acme"" brand shears and not the Wescott brand shears that were described. I contacted Amazon and asked for the correct replacement item. When I received the replacement shears, they were exactly the same ""Acme"" brand. I again returned the shears for a refund as they were not the quality that I would expect from shears advertised as Wescott brand. If they are going to send Acme brand shears, they should be advertised as Acme and not Wescott."
2,For Out of Towners,"This was a fun book. It was light, entertaining, fast paced and humorous. I am partial to the author also because she played for the Houston Comets (which is my hometown team,) went to my alma mater, the University of Texas, and she still lives in Texas.This book seems to be intended for those who don't live in Hollywood. It has some entertainment industry tips on keeping everything professional. The premise seems to be to treat your career in the entertainment industry as professional as possible. It contains interviews with various people working in the industry.The book would be stronger if she concentrated her advice to one trade- screenwriting, acting, producing, singing or whatever. Although Fran seems to be quite a dynamo, and her motivational and communication skills are obvious, her book doesn't fully explore or enlighten one to the inside of the industry. She does a good job keeping me reading by utilizing the aforementioned communication skills."
2,Didn't like it.,It started off well. The cinematography was rich and nice. The Tamil gal Madhu Balan was very pleasing to look at. Saif acted well as usualBut the story was terrible. I preferred Devdas by the same author and the movie by the same name made by SLB.This is so pretentious... I am thinking this was showcasing how pretentious the Bengali Culture is. Its sick pathos. My impressions of the Bengali culture just went downhill. I didn't think it could get any lower with their Marxism culture an all but it sure did.
2,Boring half the time. But the acting is quite good.,"This movie does have some of that song and dance and melodrama associated with all Hindi movies and the story line is also weak. But what gets this movie above others is the acting. Almost all actors really do a good job in carrying this movie and that's what makes this flick worth a couple of bucks. If you have something better to watch, do so."
5,Just Wonderful!,"This charming collection of essays will do a great deal to inspire readers to turn the pages of Amy Lowell with a deeper understanding of her words. Today, the spirit of Amy Lowell's poetry resides in these essays.This collection explores the work of one of Americas most influential poets, 1925 Pulitzer Prize-winner Amy Lowell (1874-1925). A cigar-smoker, Boston Brahmin, lesbian, impresario, entrepreneur, wildly popular lecturer, and best-selling poet. A respected authority on modern poetry, she forged the path that led to the works of the famous Allen Ginsberg, May Sarton, Sylvia Plath, and beyond.To date, this book provides a thorough examination of this prolific poet. Amy Lowell, American Modern should be read to discover more about one of America's most influential poets."
5,Only stuffed toy my son warmed up to,"This is the only stuffed toy my son ever warmed up to. He got his first one as a gift when he was a baby and up to this day (he's 4) he still snuggles with it in bed.He liked this toy so much that he asked me to get him another (thank goodness Amazon has them!) so that his 'baby elephant' won't be lonely. He now has two and he couldn't be happier with them.The toy is very well made, cuddly and yet firm. Not too big, perfect size to hold and carry around. The color held up well and we've only had to spot clean with damp cloth several times."
3,The Floodplain of the Nile and the Mysteries of Egypt,"I saw the IMAX film of the same name several years back, and remember being struck by the exotic feel and lush arrangements of the score. That said, it is always tricky to purchase a CD of film score music, because without the film, some of the songs can lose their sense of purpose. As a case in point, some of the tunes are all of 1-2 minutes in length!Nevertheless, it would be worth the purchase price for track #7 alone(just listen to the breathtakingly beautiful start to FLOODPLAIN OF THE NILE), if not for the fact that I already had that track and a couple of others on Mr. Cardons EARTH CINEMA CD.All in all, this CD has some fine moments, but either get the DVD to enjoy the whole experience as it was intended, or buy the aforementioned EARTH CINEMA CD, which is a well done Ethno-World extravaganza done in Sam's own inimitable style."
4,Thunder Over the Ochoco - Series,"It's too bad that this series is not taught in school. There are sections that are too intense for children below age 13. I am from western Oregon and so much of this history was left out of my education on the Oregon Territory.The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the detailed documentation may be too much for some. However, the research is phenominal, what a legacy to leave for the Ontko family.What else is left out of our history books?"
1,These books have the facts skewed,I read this series of books quite some time ago. At the time I found them to be informative and enjoyable. But recently I was told by several historians that the author skewed the facts on several items in the book to make things more interesting or different then they really were. Which is my reason for rating these books so low. If you are just looking for a book to read for fun then they are a good pick. But take the information with a grain of salt. I recommend doing your own research into the subject.
5,Review of XLarge Reptile Bowl,"I have recently purchased the xlarge reptile bowl for my Bearded Daragon. Its a great bowl as he can bath in it, it looks great & doesnt take up that much room in his enclosure. I think he is pretty happy! By purchasing this bowl from Amazon rather than a pet shop has saved me quite alot of money!"
4,Almost perfect addition to Panasonic FZ-5,"The extra view with this lens means I can shoot indoors and not have to worry about getting a good shot... When I don't need a flash. The only drawback is the lens is large, large enough that the flash on top of the camera is blocked.Otherwise, I can find so little distortion that I rarely have to correct for it in PhotoShop and at least with my setup there are no additional artifacts or fringing that I've seen on screen or in 5 x 7 prints.It does not work well into the 12X telephoto range of my camera (extreme tunnel vision and visably soft edges), but the FZ-5 has a quick disconnect lens adapter, so if I need to switch it's not an issue."
5,Powerful stuff,"Tom Wentz is an intelligent person who has helped our company on a journey of transformational change. A couple of years ago, we were like many companies, working very hard to achieve incremental improvements each year. We were focused solely on our objective, a financial return, without a singular direction or vision to guide us. We were out of alignment. Tom came in and facilitated the process of articulating a vision and a purpose for our company. We have seen incredible things happening ever since. We are focused on creating, not problem solving. We understand the singular vision for the company, and we are all working toward creating it. We understand why the company exists, its purpose, and we are engaging our people to live it. Senior management is aligned. Tom's book is not one you can skim and put back on the shelf. It must be digested at a pace which allows you to think, communicate and live the concepts. Should you do this, it will change the way you think and work forever."
5,"A must read in our world of ""nuts & bolts"" thinking.","Tom has captured and clearly explains the value of transforming the way you should think in order to change all aspects of how you do business - internally and externally. His concept on the ""Competitive Advantage Equation"" (CA) was a major breakthrough for our organization. (Chapter 10) CA defines, in simple terms, what we need to communicate to our sales representatives on how they should view their value for their customers. We teach this equation several time a year in our National Accounts University sessions. The competitve advantage equation is one of several foundation stones for ""transformational"" thinking in our organization."
5,Challenging read...right on target...new business model,"Tom could be the new Drucker of the millenium. This information is right on target, will be difficult for mass production thinkers to accept, but, mass production thinking is everywhere. There are so many crisis managers out there trying to ""fix"" their people and organization and it won't work. I have implemented his new context with a corporate client who has people ""enrolled"" in the process of creating their new vision. It is so exciting to see and refreshing. The president of this organization is having more fun and accomplishing more than he has in 26 yrs. This is a book that you will need to read, reread, absorb and simulate. Mass production thinkers will not like what Tom has to say, but remember ""it is not about the people, it's about the structure"" This is not the way people think in mass production corporations. Way to go Tom!!!"
4,Very Good Value,I bought this for my son's brand new PSP. My adult nephew was able to affix it to the screen fairly easily. There was just one tiny bubble at the corner but it looks great!
2,good idea-bad application,"It is a good idea, but application method SUCKS! I have tried numerous times & I cannot get the air bubbles out from under the protective film. It makes playing games or watching movies difficult."
3,psp screen protector,"good quality for the price, although they could have made it slightly bigger for the psp slim. make sure when applying that you get it dead center by not starting exactly from the edge as you will notice a gap on the other side if you do. in other words, as you line it up using either the left or right side edge of the screen, give yourself about a millimeter from the edge and you should be dead center with another millimeter gap on the other side."
1,N.G. Protective Filter,"This filter creates air bubbles that are impossible to press out. It also slides easily if you touch the screen. Lastly, you only receive one filter for the price. I would definitely steer clear of this protective filter."
3,BAD PRODUCT!!!!!,"Okay, where to start:Pros:1)You get a little hanky thing inside.Cons:I tried to get my product, and what did I find? A sticker. On the little screen. I tried to take it off. I managed, just barely. But....I still had that sticky and half paper on my screen protector. All I got out of it was a little hanky, not bad for cleaning, yet not worth $5. I heard this was an EXCELLENT product, so I was very disapointed.It has a sticker on top, gives you only ONE[!!!!] screen protector which will easily break, and also it has a sticker on it - which is way to sticky. I barely managed to get it off, and in the end, it didn't really help."
1,Did my sender mess up?,"The Hori Filter came with the sheets to protect the filter, but when seperated, there was no filter at all!"
3,I bought from SF Planet,"I bought this from SF Planet like a month ago. I didnt really pay attention when they came in the mail. I just tried putting on 2 of the 3 that I order a month ago today. Worst screen protector I have ever put on. I have decent amount of experience putting on screen protectors so I thought this is going go well right? Hell no bubbles everywhere I couldnt even get rid of some. These are sticky residue ones name "" Fosmon "". So I came on here to check what I order. WHAT THE HELL, I ordered HORI not FOSMON. What is up with these company? I have one left and I dont think Im gonna try it. Seem like they expired if you know what I mean.SF Planet, do not buy these from them. You just might get another brand."
2,Didn't receive Hori,"Like some of the other reviews mention, non-amazon sellers sell a different brand of filter than the advertised Hori on this page. I've received a brand called Cisco or some other but I figured what the hey, it's only a few bucks - sad to say, it already has a lot of scratches from only a few days of play (don't see how! it's not even a touch screen!) but it's done what it was supposed to do... kinda."
1,"Not great, not great at all.","I bought this because it was cheap but in the end I payed the price for being cheap with myself. This product isn't even by Hori, at least the one I received wasn't from Hori. This thing leaves a messy stickiness on your screen that practically ruins it. I managed to get all the sticky off and all the residue from this garbage by using the cloth that came with it. The cloth ended up scratching my screen! I bought this with the intention to protect my screen instead this thing only did harm. I threw it out the same day I got it. Lesson learned! Stay away, stay far away!!! Run now before it's too late. My advice is, don't be a cheapskate and buy the better, albeit expensive, ones out there."
4,"A good protector, but smudges a bit and develops air pockets","The smudges generally only show when the Zen is off, so that part doesn't matter too much.All in all, glad I bought it. It is slightly too small for the screen, but just slightly, nothing to be too concerned about."
1,Do not buy from CTC CHITEK Corp,"I bought it here it clearly said HORI brand.. What I got instead was a CHITEK CORP brand screen protector. Not only did I receive a different brand but a defective product as well.The screen isn't transparent and will give your PSP a distracting ""shimmering and glittery"" effect. Again, it's not transparent like it should be.I tried to contact them and said they can't do anything about it.Whatever you do do not get it from CHITEK CORP CTC. Goodluck."
2,Overpriced and Does Not Fit Slim PSP-2000,"I do not know if the screen size is the same for the PSP original and the PSP-2000 because I only have the slim. If they are the same size, then this HORI product does not fit either. There is going to be a wide gap between the screen edges with this protector with the slim.The supplied cloth is junk. It is not microfibre and has so much lint and cloth particles on it you are better off using a t-shirt.It is made of the static high quality screen material, and what it does cover it covers well, however. There are no air bubbles when applied correctly. It is VERY easy to mess this up when applying though, so be prepared to make a few expensive mistakes.I know HORI also makes a PSP-2000 version of this screen, but this is not it. Maybe that fits better."
2,Only one filter!!!,I thought the pack would include 5 filters or at least 2. Only one with this price!
2,Air bubbles and way too small for the screen,"I could not get rid of even *MOST* of the air bubbles and the screen protector itself is just too small for a proper fit to the screen anyway.I also purchased the JavoScreen by JavoEdge and am far happier with it. They make one for the both PSPs (original and slim) it fits the screen better and comes with an applicator to get out *ALL* the air bubbles. I also gave a review for it.See it here on amazon.com at:Sony PlayStation Portable Slim (PSP) JAVOScreen Anti Glare Screen Protector (Screen Only)I cannot recommend the Hori, I would recommend the JavoEdge instead for your PSP screen protection needs.*Edit* Inserted link and grammatical corrections"
5,Filter works just fine,I just installed this Hori filter on my Sony PSP and proceeded to win Need for Speed by my greatest time margin ever. Clearly a superior product!No adult should have difficulty applying this product to the PSP screen.
1,Wouldn't pay more than 50 cents for this,"I bought the product from the great reviews, but this is by far the worst product I've bought from Amazon.It is way over-priced for a thin sheet that failed to ""function"". It is a huge hassle to apply onto your PSP. I read the directions closely and made an attempt to put it on.First, it did not cover the whole screenSecond, many many air bubbles appearedThird, I tried to re-apply, but MORE bubbles appearedAfter 30 mins of patience, more and more bubbles appeared each time I took it off. I trashed the filter and bought a case that covers my screen"
2,Bad experience,"I looked over the Internet for several screen protectors for my new PSP, and I found this one as the best option.(The screen protector from Sony it's only available in Japan). I follow all the instructions and I have bubbles everywhere. I take it away, put it again, and I can manage to have less bubbles, very little and tiny ones, but still have them. It looks good for protecting the screen, but terrible for admiring this amazing screen."
1,wrong company item,"I order HORI company's item I have FOSMON company's one, too suckthat is lie to the coustomers......i won't buy item on this owner again."
5,Pure Psycho,This is the first Meteors recording. They era playing here with an Upright Bass. Original Line Up. All songs a Killers. Join into thr Death Dance. Only the Meteors are pure Psycho!!!
2,Kind of/Kind of not,"Good characters, vivid Wall St./New York backdrop. Heroine quite naive in reading people, not picking up on clues, to be a brilliant connector oe people and positions. Perhaps better for those knowledgeable about financial workings."
2,Foghorn Outdoors: California Golf 10 Ed:,"Pretty much the same format as earlier editions, but different editor with mistakes and omissions...pretty lame update. Lots of information, but too bulky to be convenient, and don't trust all the driving directions. Take a pass on this one."
1,Disappointing!,"Too many mistakes like wrong area codes and bad driving directions. Other than new courses, text borrows on old language of previous editors. Disappointing!"
3,Thomas Guide of Golf,"If you've got room in your car, this is the Thomas Guide of Golf. Ocassionally it throws you a bone about the course, subjective stuff isn't much, but phone numbers and driving insructions are fairly accurate. Local tidbits and history of the courses make it ocassionally interesting."
4,spring time,This is a neat collection of poems all about spring! A lot of springtime fun is included in the poems. From playing in the rain to warm weather activities it's all here in this one book! Celebrate spring with poetry!What did you like or not like about the book?I liked the play on words and all the puns in the poems.
5,Hilarious and brilliant,"This book contains the hilarious poem ""Possible World,"" a sort of parody of Mallarmé's ""Un coup de dés,"" along with a brilliant memoir and several delightful shorter poems. ""The Moor not taken"" is also very funny. Buy it together with ""Sun Out"" to see the very early and the very late Koch side by side."
5,2 Year Old Daughter Related To This,"I would say this book subtly encourages self-awareness. My 2 year old seemed to have an epiphany when we got to the line that says ""sometimes Caillou says no when he really means yes."" She looked so happy to hear that verbalized. She also liked the part about how Caillou doesn't like to be disturbed when he's playing. I think hearing these ideas in a story makes her realize that her feelings are normal and consequently she seems to have mellowed a bit from her frequent nay-saying."
2,It Sucks!,I'm using this book as a college textbook. I find the content insufficient to cover the subject matter. There are not enough solved sample problems to illustrate the concepts.
1,Utterly pathetic,"This show is a complete waste of time. Aside from the fact that some of the things this show purports to do are really faked, there are many problems here. His ""survival techniques"" are nothing close. I have been in one of the environments where Bear made a show, and if one tried to do what he supposedly did there, one would probably not return. Period. Please, don't waste your time & money with this. Go buy Survivorman instead. Les Stroud provides real guidnace, and puts himself into real survival situations."
3,missing episodes,"This DVD is not the full series 1, it is missing episodes:The RockiesCosta Rican Rain ForestMoab DesertMount KilaueaDeserted IslandI guess that's why it's called ""Man vs Wild collection 1"""
1,WHAT?!?!,"This guy is a total ham, with outdoor/survival advice that I wouldn't touch without double/triple checking. He's followed by a crew, guaranteeing his safety & protection at every turn. Where's the risk? Isn't that the whole point?Shows like this only diminish the validity of this relatively new TV genre, taking attention away from more credible & authentic shows like Les Stroud's ""Survivorman.""Next time you see ""Man vs. Wild"", watch closely, this egotistical ham literally LEAPS like a ballerina over mud puddles two feet wide."
5,Bear Rocks!,Bear Grylls is over the moon with entertainment & he is a true stud. Who cares if he has some support. I have never met anyone who could pull off even one of his stunts with support after eating a live reptile & drinking water out of an animal dung puddle. Most of all Bear does not hide his faith in God & I respect him for this above all.
4,Man vs Wild = Excellent,"Baer goes around in the natural environment and shows you how to survive in that element. He also shows you worst case situations. Is it fake? no. Is it 100 % real? no. It isn't shown in real time, meaning 1hr of being in the wild = 1hr of show. So of course they edit. The producers also assist with the survival options placed in his path to show you what to do if you run into such circumstances; dead sheep used for shelter, pre plotted caves for shelter, dead animals used for food, etc. The show is using a storyline to assist you the person in those situations, not Baer in his 'pure' situation. Meaning to say, they illustrate you more options than you may run into so you can have a greater knowledge base to make decisions that will save your life- OHH YEAH, and the show is entertaining as hell. People, please relax. It's not a con, it's cool."
4,"Highs and Lows, as Might be Expected","I very much like E.M. Forster's novel and the Merchant/Ivory film adaptation of it, but of course we're dealing with the movie soundtrack here, and like many a soundtrack, this one is very centrifugal, with several of the segments not sharing a whole lot with one another. Most tracks are relatively low-key and moody or introspective, though there's a tango at one point and an adaptation from Beethoven's Eroica at another. Oh, and a couple of arrangements of Percy Grainger tunes are included as well -- in particular Mock Morris, which is intended to cover the closing credits. It's an excellent arrangement of the tune for piano and orchestra, and frankly the main reason I bought this disc. As for the rest, there certainly are some good moments here and there -- variously thoughtful, plaintive and lush -- which tend to be broken up by segments which, as I indicated earlier, are unrelated in style and mood."
4,Taverner to Tavener,If your a Tavener fan this is a good CD to buy. It has that Tavener feel to it. I just think its realy great.
2,pair sent was not a Med. width it was a Narrow or a factory 2nd?,I own these exact shoes in 7 M and therefor felt safe ordering online. They were not true to size. They were so narrow I could barely get my foot in them...
1,Poor quality..,"I bought these shoes for work as I end up walking quite a bit. After a month of using them once in a while, they broke near the toe/arch area. The plastic inside had rubbed the leather broken :( Such comfy shoes but what a shame they fell apart so soon..."
2,what's the name of a song...,"what's the name of the band and song in the part of the movie when Roseanne is crying in the school shower after her dad rapted her ?? I thought that that song would be in the movie soundtrack but, it does't soo i would really aprecciate if someone answer my question thks. XD"
2,odds and sods,"I'll be honest, I liked the cover and the fact that it hadHusker Du and Diamanda Galas. They are my favourites on thisstrange compilation. An artifact of it's time. William Burroughsis on there ""rapping"" in his unique way, some odd dance musicfrom Cabaret Voltaire. I dunno, once in a while I put this on andI think, this is why I only listen to it ""once in a while"".In summation, it's different and that's good, not everything onthis record is good."
2,Not original artists,Musics all right but not by the original artists. Had that been divulged on the website I wouldn't have wasted my money
2,A little disappointing,"I've bought several of these 10-CD box sets from Membran/Documents and loved them. This one is disappointing. Many of the tracks are remakes. That said, there are some ""rarities,"" like live Fats Domino (not vintage live, though). But this one's not up to the standards of the others the label has put out. I wouldn't necessarily say avoid it, as the previous negative review didn't keep me from buying it, but just know what you're getting. The box is the only one from this label that I know of that has tracks from the British Invasion of the '60s, although a lot of those tracks are remakes."
3,"Nice, but quality lacking","This shelf is nice and not a bad deal for the price I paid ($8), but the one of the holes in the back to hang the shelf was not cut properly and my husband had to bore it out. The shelf is also not cut even in the front, the design itself is ascue, with one side of the vine curving in and the other flat, so it looks like the right of the shelf has an indent."
3,Alright product,"This product does what it says and removed surface film from your tank but it is very cheap to the touch and I didn't keep it in the tank. It removed the film within 2 days, 90 gallon salt tank. The film was back a few days later but I didn't want to put this back in. Main complain I have is the dependence on water level and how hard it is to set up and get working properly. I have it 3 stars because it did what it was intended to but it isn't a piece you can easily leave on your tank for a permanent fix."
1,disapointed,im very dissapointed in this product. I spent about 2 hours trying to get it to operate properly but all it did was draw air into my filter which i kept having to prime over and over again. The filter I was trying to use the skimmer with is a fluval 406 which is an excellent filter. I have to say I am really disapointed in this product especially as it is made by fluval who`s filters ive been using for over 30years without any problems whatsoever.
4,It works.,This intake works for my tank. I have a lot of floating waste on the surface and this thing suck it up in a few hours.
5,Gift,"I purchased this for my husband for Christmas. We have not watched it yet, but are looking forward too.The DVD looks new, so I can only assume that it is:) I didn't have to wait long to receive it."
3,Low budget classic.,"This is a fun film that was very low budget. I liked it because of all the chases, but it really drags out. Plus the movie just ends and leaves you with a little disappointment. Makes you wonder what happens next. Over all this was an good movie with a few funny parts and good car chases."
1,"Eat my dust, then vomit it up","The only thing holding up this movie is the legs of the costar Christopher Norris(yes, she's a girl),which is why I gave it 1 star. A half star for each leg. I recommend it to anyone in search of a (...) car chase film that uses fast motion technology and third grade dialogue. Sorry, this one's not worth it at half the price. I shudder at the thought of watching the other Ron Howard movie (GTA)I bought when fulfilling my dream of owning every car chase movie ever produced. Don't do it, stay away."
1,If the Dukes of Hazzard were from California,"If you like the Dukes of Hazzard, the 3 stooges, the movie Wild HOGS, you would probably like Eat my DUST. If Ron HOward wasn't emberessed, before, I bet he is now. Corny, predictable, I AM embarressed I got the DVD-thank God I didn't see it in public. I give it the ONE star for the sound track full of engine sounds."
4,Gotta have it in you car movie collection,"This is the movie I would tell my freind about as an adult,and he had never heard of it. Then one night at Holliwood vid I saw it in the vhs section. Man I was excited!! Couldn't wait to get it in the player. Well it wasn't as good as I had rembered. But that isn't the point. Dukes of Hazzards not as great as it was when we were kids, but you still have to watch it every once in awhile! Anyways you get to see Ron Howard with a full head of hair lol and I think his brother is in it to. Car chases and a cute girl. What more could you ask for! Buy it"
3,Fun 70s Car-Chase Flick and... the Luscious Christopher Norris!,"This is merely another one of those many 70s car-chase films. It's fun & mindless and features some beautiful rural California locations. Plus, how can you go wrong with the likable Ron Howard?The film was a box-office success for producer Roger Corman, which naturally led to the demand for a sequel. But Ron Howard didn't want money to perform in the sequel, he just wanted the opportunity to write and direct it (not to mention act in it). Thus came the hugely popular ""Grand Theft Auto,"" Howard's first REAL stab at directing. The rest is history.This flick is merely okay, nothing special; what makes it worth purchasing for any red-blooded male is the supremely gorgeous Christopher Norris (yeah, it's a woman not a man). She's got some incredible God-given curves, to say the least, and she shows them off well in her skimpy hot-pants!Of course, if you're a ""Brokeback Mountain"" fan there's always Ron Howard. (LOL!!)"
3,Typical Speedvision Movie.,"Ron Howard was his usual boring self. His cute girlfrriend Darlene was basically the only reason to watch this otherwise dumb movie. I saw it on Speedvision last night where Bruce Dern gave his usual misplaced comments re: Roger Corman, Peter Fonda, Laura Dern, Dianne Ladd et al. They sure wrecked up a bunch of old police cars though. In the end sweet darlene just up and walked away. What a rack. Somehow his orange '67 Camaro survived to race again."
3,Lionel now.....,"Ok, let me preface this with the fact I am a huge Lionel Richie fan...he could put out a pile of poo and I would purchase it. With that said, while there are some good songs on this albums (and his recent albums) but as a whole the albums leave you wanting more. His classic albums held you from beginning to end while this a his recent albums are ""hit and miss"" at best. It is tough to say but I think one of the drawbacks recently is the songwriting...y'know wouldn't it be nice to just hear Lionel play the piano and sing and not worry so much about production and getting that ""modern sound."" Don't get me wrong there is some quality material here that if you are a fan of LR you will love...it just does not grab you and hold you from beginning to end...(like he used too). HMMM...maybe a reunion with the Commodores is in order!!!!!!! Now that would be outrageous!"
3,Just a little disappointed,"Although I am a huge fan of Lionel Richie, I was disappointed in this CD. There are a couple of really good songs (like Just For You) and the rest are marginal at best."
4,Just for You ~ is... Just about right !,"Lionel takes risks on this CD while most succeed at hitting the target some encourage critics to once again mock this talented composer/artist. The chord structure on the opening track appears to be misguided. It seems inspired from recent U2 material. It's an improvement over his last single released ""Angel"". That production on that song sounded strongly borrowed from Cher's 1999 hit ""Believe"". The bulk of material produced on JUST FOR YOU remains faithful to the styling of RICHIE and will surely delight fans. All in all, RICHIE, one of the biggest male vocalist of late 70s early 80s, finally offers to the public a CD that officially registers him as an artist for the new millenium."
3,Good Album....But Lionel has done better,"After reading all the comments for this album so far l just had to add this...As a fan of Def Leppard AND Lionel Richie - I think they BOTH do beautiful versions of ""Long Long Way To Go"". Both artists are successful and deserve the repect they have earned by being in the the music business for so long.As a whole though, l did find this album a little dissapointing after absolutely loving his last two releases ""Time"" and ""Renaisance"". Lionel could do better...."
1,Disappointed fan,"I listened to Lionel Richie's entire album 'Just For You' with every intention of buying it as I own most of Lionel's earlier work especially up to the time of the early nineties. Unfortunately I found it to be a polished pop production yes, but melodically predictable and lyrically generic and boring. Lionel has fallen into the trap of following the current crowd of pop/R&B artists where the emphasis is on hot production but at best mediocre songs. I don't expect extremely successful artists to stay the same over decades, what I do expect is that they will at least maintain a certain standard when it comes to the finished product. When all is said and done this latest effort from Lionel did not connect with me and what artists need to be careful of is that they are not sacrificing genuine feeling in their music for the slick production that is so evident on the pop charts."
3,sounds like... everything else,"I bought this album expecting good music, the way it used to be. Instead what I heard was a decent take on the same tried and true pop music that clutters the radio. A few tracks do break the usual mold, but this album doesn't distinguish it's self. The same old thing just proves to be boring. Lionel has a great voice and i'm still a fan. I just expected something more then the a mimick of whats out now."
1,Disappointing in all respects,"I love vintage Lionel, but this is really subpar - poor songs, poor overly polished and underly original production, and too many gimmicks (by the time they start the African chant in ""She's Amazing"" I'm about ready to puke). I couldn't even listen all the way through - it was so bad. The most memorable song is perhaps the title cut and first on the album (Just for You) - it's OK - just doesn't really go anywhere.Hopefully Lionel's best will come back with a future album."
3,STP did NOT cover def Leppard,"regarding:>>>Everyone wants to mock Def Leppard, but so far Lionel, Maria and STP have covered their songs.STP has never covered Def Leppard. There's an MP3 on the net of an acoustic ""Pour Some Sugar on Me"" that some have labeled as STP, but it IS Def Leppard themselves. That version appears on DL's import CD single of ""Slang."" You can't believe every filename you read."
3,You've got to be kidding me!!!!!!!!!,"Lionel can sing, but now he's doing a cover of Def Leppard's ""Long, Long, Way to Go"".Maybe it's funny, maybe it's justice. Everyone wants to mock Def Leppard, but so far Lionel, Maria and STP have covered their songs. Go figure..."
1,Save your money!!,"The only good song on this album is ""Just for You"". The rest of it sucks and I mean it. You are better of just purchasing the single."
1,"Lionel my Friend, Give It Up.","I just purchased this cd, and I have to say that I am totally dissapointed the direction his music has traveled (or rather spiralled *downward* that is). My WIFE doesn't even want it! We are trying to think of someone who we could give it to who won't use it for a frisby or coaster, but so far no luck. Don't take this personally Lionel, but the overall production was horrible - most of the album sounds like it was produced on outdated equipment by inexperienced personel. Honestly, I don't see how you got this distributed... I really don't. On many of the tracks, his voice seems to change tone and clarity, as if it was recorded on completely different equipment and microphones than the last song. The magic just isn't there, Poor production, and the arrangements are sad. I'm sorry, I'll have to agree with another reviewer who said ""Save your money""."
5,Two of their best and in STEREO,Sepia generally does a great job and this CD is no exception. I think these were the best of the Ames Brothers albums. And they are in STEREO unlike a lot of the Jasmine product.
5,nostalgic,"for anyone who remenbers the Ames Brothers and that era,it brings back great memories and for those too young will give them some real oldies to listen to. My husband and i really enjoyed the cd and wish we could listen to it again for the first time. marsha"
3,Disappointed,"I was looking forward to receiving this CD, but when I received it I was disappointed. The way they are singing is a little too upbeat for me. I liked the slower great harmony of the Ames Brothers."
3,"A decent, upbeat mix","This CD is pretty good. It's uplifting, melodic with high BPM (beats per minute). Great to work out to. I give it a 3 only because it would have to be mind blowing to recieve a 4 or 5 from me. But it is definitely good, the mix flows nice and the music is pretty tight."
2,Misleading,"When I read the title and CD's decription, I expected all the songs to feature great vocals set to house/techno music. I soon discovered that wasn't the case. One song has absolutely no vocals, and most of the other songs don't feature much vocal work at all.It's too bad, because there are some amazing singers out there who could easily make a cd like this take off... but all they need is some space on the CD to do their thing. This CD could have been much, much better. Don't pay full price! Get it used."
2,Too much starch in the matzo balls,"Fascinating subject matter as I grew up in an area where Jews were a vocal and very assimilated minority. The author's extensive research came to the same conclusions in every chapter: it was hard to keep Kosher in the South and black household help did much of the cooking. As a Jewish woman I am proud of our reputation for a sense of humor and delicious cooking. There are very few recipes; even those were not particularly tempting or typical. The book's major flaws lie in the author's dry, labored, one-note writing style that had me laboring to stay awake."
5,TANTALIZING TINGES: A DISCOGRAPHY OF EARLY JAZZ AND NOVELTY SYNOCAPED PIANO RECORDINGS,"THIS IS TRULY WHAT A DISOGRAPHY SHOULD BE REVEALING THE RECORDING SOURCE, PERSONNEL, DATES ALONG WITH LABEL, CATALOGUE NUNBER AND THE MASTER NUMBER. THIS HAS A LOT OF TITLES THAT DON'T QUITE FIT IN A JAZZ OR BLUES CATAGORY. THIS MAINLY FOCUSES ON NOVELITY PIANO SOLOS AND RAGTIME MUSIC LONG FORGOTTEN. A MUST FOR ANY ZEZ CONFREY OR LEE SIMS FAN! I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE BOOKS LIKE THIS IN PRINT."
1,God? Again??,"I am not reading this book on the basis that it contains God yet again. I threw away another self help book after it told me to turn my problems over to God. Really?That's ridiculous on a level that is well, ridiculous. Look, if God was so aweseome he sure did a piss poor job with ""creating"" humans. Eyesight alone is a mess. HAHA! Look, the dinosaurs were here for 165 millions years. No, humans did not hang out with the dinosaurs. The ice age came, the dinosaurs died, the furry rodents went under ground to survive and then when they could suface they did and slowly but surely our monkey ancestors came to be which is what created you and me. Get over it and stop sneaking God into self help books!!"
4,Worth the read,"Every English 102 professor seems to require a paper on ""The Awakening."" This book was invaluable when doing my research paper. Not only does it contain various opinions, it has great quotes for citing. It also makes comparisons between ""The Awakening"" and other books of the late 1800's and early 1900's, discusses how it was received, etc.... worth it if you do critical reading."
2,good... while it lasted,"with these subs i also bought a 4000 watt amp that was 2-channel with 2000 watts peak and 1000 watts rms per channel, when wired as 4-ohm, which is what the sub's ratings are based on. therefore the amp and sub configuration were a perfect match, however approximately 1/2 an hour into driving with them i noticed a plastic/rubber burning smell and immediately shut off power to them. upon inspection both subs were blown and completely unusable. this leads to the conclusion that they were poorly rated and of poor quality materials, and i hereby advise that unless your going to run way under the limits, they are no good"
5,Love this,I bought this as I added side tool boxed to my truck and my employees have to get things out of the side all the time. They have put a few scratches on the side and can not see in the bottom all the time. This is a huge help and very well build. It will adjust to most any size tire.
3,THE ROAD TO HELL,"HAVE NOT READ, BOUGHT IT FOR MY HUSBAND AND HE ENJOYED IT. I WILL PROBABLY READ IT IN THE FUTURE."
5,The Road to Hell,Very factual account of the Hells Angels in Canada. Particular detailed accounts from their inception in 1984 to 2003. Very well researched. A must read for anybody interested in organized crime.
3,the road to hell,"If you want some History from our neighboring country, this is the book you want to read. Written by two professionals, this book let us understand that the struggle between the Motorcycle community and the police is in every facit of your daily lifes. Only in this book is's the Mounties. It also tell us that what we deal with in this country is the same all over the world. I found it a well written book with all the bells and whistles that go along with a story if this kind:A history lesson!"
1,Very One sided,"You may find this book interesting if you think reading the author's recital of police information is really investigative journalism. At no point in this book do you get an opposing position. If you really want to see what it is like to wear the patch of an Outlaw club, and learn the true tactics that state, local and federal agencies will use, read ""OutBad"" and ""The AgingRebel: Dispatches from the Motorcycle Outlaw Frontier"" by Donald Charles Davis. You may not agree with us, but at least you will get a balanced look at our life and the treatment we face from law enforcement. It will be much better than reading this tripe or watching Sons of Anarchy."
2,Kind of a drag,"I feel like the lone ranger here, but I did not enjoy this book. I finished it all the time hoping that something would click, but it just never happened. I never came to care about the characters and the story dragged on for what seemed like forever."
3,a poor quality transfer of a great film,"Most of the reviews here already say it. It's one of the great British films of its era. I just wanted to make a point about what a poor quality transfer to DVD this particular release is. It's so dreadful it looks like it's done from an old U-Matic master used for VHS releases. It's also worth mentioning that you should see ""If"" first if you are to get the joke in the final scene."
1,"Post Office Says It Was Delivered, But I Never Received","It's not the shipper's fault, but I paid for these items and never received them."
5,YEAH,"I give this movie 5 stars because they just don't make 'em like this anymore. Also, when I read comments where folks bash the 70's, I simply wonder,I mean WONDER-what are they comparing the 1970's to??? Today? WHAT? You have got to be kidding? O Lucky Man is a journeyman movie built with the rambling sober style so popular at the time. The soundtrack I found irritating BUT it's still classic and really the movie wouldn't be the same without it. Some of the images and scenes in this movie are simply in the very top of movie ideas, the very top. See this movie. And as far as dated, it is dated compared to Survivor, The Apprentice, Friends, The Reality Show, ad nauseum and all the rest of the Nothing Zone we call today's digital media culture offerings. Blah! Give me the ole rusty 70's any day of the week!"
5,O LUCKY VIEWER,"Really, my favorite film post Clockwork Orange. If you are a fan of Malcolm Mcdowell and enjoy movies from the 1970's, this witty, social, political satire could spark your interest. Probably one of the better soundtracks of any movie, you'll love the way the music sets the mood and makes this movie an all-time-classic!"
5,A Masterpiece,"But consider the source. Anderson is (was) a quirky and self-indulgent genius. Even his best work -- this film -- was uneven. Malcolm McDowell is brilliant. Ralph Richardson, too. Helen Mirren shines. Some of the other performances seem snarky and too self-aware. The idea of incorporating Alan Price and the soundtrack band as characters is original and successful. The film is too long by 30-40 minutes (self-indulgent, remember?) but the last two minutes redeem all its faults."
5,o very lucky man,sophisticated comedy drama about a man who deals with life and the strange people he meets along the way
2,Tedious,"(Note: The Instant Video version includes a 20-minute scene toward the end that was cut from the original U.S. release. It doesn't help.)I saw this film as a college student, and thought that it was really sophisticated, cool, and cerebral. Now I find it tedious. The humor isn't all that funny. The players are more archetypes than characters. It's interesting to see it as a snapshot of England in the 1970s; and it's interesting to see actors Malcom McDowell and Helen Mirren when they were younger. But you may get to the ending credit roll and conclude that you had just wasted three hours of your life."
3,Well made British film,"I enjoyed seeing a young Helen Mirren in this film.The fixes this fellow got himself into are really goodin business, and life.The music is really pretty greatand I enjoyed it as much or more than the rest of the film."
4,DVD Release in October!,"I just saw on Netflix that O Lucky Man! will be released in October!Can't wait to order it!I got ""IF"" when it released. Another awesome movie!"
2,Nonsense,"The acting's great, the music's great, but the plot, such as it isn't, makes no sense whatsoever. No scene in an endless series of unrelated scenarios makes any sense at all. Everyone associated with this movie must've been stoned out of his or her mind. And it's 3 hours long! I screened it because some other stoned out person gave it a 4 star review, and the only reason I sat through the whole thing was I kept erroneously thinking this has got to get better. Ha! They were stoned!"
3,Where's the AUDIO--CAVEAT EMPTOR!!,"I purchased the two-tape set ,as I only had a 'chopped-up' version copied from A&E; - onto a tape at slow speed, from Amazon.com sometime ago. I only discovered,recently, that Tape #2 has no Audio. I made up a copy at fullspeed from my original TV- copy (Inferior Quality but at least I had sound).The tapes that were purchased and the movie deseerve 5 stars except for this technical error--My mistake was that I did not check the tapes when they arrived so I left it too late to return the tapes. I just wanted a good copy on hand! Caveat Emptor!"
5,Exceptionally clear introduction to Friends,"As an attendee of a local meeting for the last year, I have learned a great deal about Quakerism but Jim Pym's book has put all the pieces together for me in a clear, interesting and easily understood style that has significantly enhanced the value I recieve from 'sitting in the light.' From readers merely curious about Quakerism to Confirmed Friends, I highly recommend this wonderful book to anyone with an interest in the Religious Society of Friends."
4,"Great product, just one complaint","I ordered this case so I wouldn't have to leave my PSP games just lying around. The case is very well made, including an extra pouch in the back for I guess a memory stick? Or perhaps just anything you could fit in there.The case holds 8 games, so it should be quite some time before I fill it up. (For those of you who have many games, you may want to look into something else, unless you want to buy several of these.)My only complaint is that Amazon does not let you choose the color you want. I wanted the red one, I got the black one with the blue stripe.Overall though I'd reccomend this to anyone looking for a case to store thier games."
4,"Handy, compact UMD case","Great value and convenient carrying case for PSP UMD games and movies. It's compact, lighweight and very well constructed. It protects the UMD disks inside very well from scratches and drops, although not large crushing forces. (Don't sit on it!)Holds 8 UMDs in non-abrasive sleeves."
3,"Mediocre, besides being not too good.","In spite of the product description, it's not all that it's crack up to be. There's one tiny spot in color-to qualify it as in color. It's all black & white. And the taping is very poor. Only because it's Bob Hope that this video has any merit."
2,Movie was too slow for me,"I didn't care for this movie. The movie moved too slow for me. And the actors seemed inexperienced , lacked passion and motivation."
3,"Not a Smash, But Worth an Hour","Well, this is not the most accurate version of Dickens' ""Christmas Carol,"" and I feel Jim Henson's muppets actually did a better job. But this is a cute version, and if you have an hour between Christmas preperations, this is not a bad way to spend it. To some extent, the story takes a back seat to music. But, the music is memorable, some of the animation is done well, and Tom Bosley as the London Humbug is a witty narrator. If I were trying to teach children the story, I would sooner use ""The Muppets' Christmas Carol."" But if you already know the story, and you have an hour with nothing to do, this is a pleasant musical to watch."
5,straight up good music,"This is a strong CD - great from start to finishThe songs are unique and the album moves.I still don't know Spanish, but this is one album that makes me wish I did..It's evident fromt this CD that julieta is a very inventive artist - she has a sense for pop, but her music has substance.I'm anticipating her next release."
3,No se compara con 'Aquí',"Si bien es cierto que se le nota bastante más cómoda con su voz, y con las composiciones, me parece que a este disco le falta un poco de la frescura que tenía 'Aquí'Destacan en este álbum ""Seria Feliz"", y ""Sueño de Sombras"". Hay otra pieza que pertenece al soundtrack de la película 'Amores Perros', que entiendo es co-producida por gente de Café Tacuba.A mi parecer, Julieta tiene mucho más que ofrecer que lo que logró con este disco."
4,Evolución de su estilo,"Desde de su primer trabajo Julieta Venegas ha demostrado cierto dominio de instrumentos como el acordeón, la guitarra y la grabadora, sin embargo, con este nuevo albúm demuestra el dominio total de estos instrumentos además de una evolución en su estilo, con acordes más refinados y con un toque de new age.Hay un número mayor de canciones en este albúm y sin embargo exísten varias que personalmente no eran necesarias, pues son casi idénticas a algunas compuestas anteriormente. Entre ellas estan Fé, Casa abandonada, Siempre en mi mente y Bueninvento. Las recomendadas Otro sol, Sería feliz ySueño de sombrasy Flor. En general las canciones son menos ritmicas que en su primer trabajo.Recomendable para los fans y los que quieren conocer su música, una opción excelente de música en español."
2,It's Okay,"This plush toy is just ""okay."" Was not one of my daughter's favorites (she was nine when she received it). Compared to other plush toys I bought her around the same time, this plush toy wasn't as good (quality-wise). It has lasted because my daughter is gentle with her toys but this one is just not a ""cute"" as the others and not as soft."
4,Fine tiger cub,We bought this plush tiger cub as a mascot for 2010 (year of the tiger) after looking at many many plush tigers. This is the best - soft and cuddly. The only drawback is that he has a permanently sad facial expression. What was the manufacturer thinking?
3,The Art of Arousal,"The selction of pictures and the quality of printing on very good heavy paper is a pleasure. I guess for newcomers who need to acqaint themselves with the art of arousal it's quite good. For connoisseurs of that art it's not really up to expectations. But if you collect this kind of genre and if you buy a used edition (mine was esentiaslly new) at a reduced price, it could well be worth the addition."
5,Top notch flamenco,"I've found it extremely hard to find a good recording of traditional flamenco, but to find this album makes the search worthwhile. Paco is an expert guitar player. His melodies range from soft and simple, to fiery and intense. I have to debate whether or not to play this guy on the radio next year, because if I do, nothing else I play will sound as good. I'm looking foreward to any more albums that Paco comes out with, and I hope they come soon. Anyone who loves flamenco guitar must have this album!"
5,coincidence?????,"Hmmmm,is it only me or what;but I seem to note a distinct sameness with Lewis'""Perelandra"" and it's story about a ""non-fallen"" race of beings who would presumably be""in contact/rhythm"" with their planet's Mother Nature(becausethey're non-fallen) and Cameron's""Pandora"" with it's race of beings with a similar set of circumstances.I wonder if the estate of CS Lewis must've thought upon viewing ""Avatar""?!?!!!??(If they have.)I am not a lawyer but I find it sort of fishy.Feel free to contact me at dennis_york7@hotmail.com if you have the same funny feeling about this ""coincidence""!Calling all publishing/copyright lawyers!!!!"
2,Outdated,"This is a decent book with some excellent basic rules on sweepstaking, but for the most part it's obsolete because it was written well before the internet boom, therefore excluding any discussion of how to enter sweepstakes and contests online. I can't say I'd recommend this book when there are many others out there that are more up to date."
3,Safety and Health for Engineers,"I just passed my ASP and this book was an excellent introductory text. While it is understood that many other reference have to be used, I recommend this book as one of the first you review."
5,"A Mini-Encyclopedia of Diverse, Useful Information","This single volume is jam-packed with a great deal of information. You can learn about such things as fire safety, the ergonomics of manual labor, human impact (pardon the pun) of falling accidents, electric shock hazards, the effects on humans of heat and cold, chemical hazards, biohazards, radiation hazards, and so much more."
4,Bought for my husband,"My husband is a safety manager in construction, this was for a class he was taking. Thank goodness we didn't have to pay full price for this! I recommend always checking with Amazon before purchasing even text books!"
4,Informative,"This book is very informative, however, there are numerous typos throughout the book which can be extremely distracting. Content wise the book is pretty easy to learn from."
5,love it,"best sling bag ever and it is a perfect fit. Best of all I saved $$$ over buying other brands of bag. The color is a little strange for leather it is actually greyish with a silver ""tick"" i think is the word.it has 2 pockets inside one with and one without a zipper."
2,Cheap TV Movie of a good TV Show,A really low bucks updating of the 60's TV show. Ed McBain couldn't have liked this outing. Randy Quaid or Ving Rhames couldn't save this lemon!
2,Another not very good sheena album,"'Madness, Money, and Music' is one of my favourite albums, but Sheena's career went downhill from there (with a few blips of which 'No sound but a heart' was definitely one).This album is definitely not as bad as 'Do you', but it's not much better. 'Fire and Rain' is by far the best track, showcasing Sheena's beautiful voice. But it was never the voice that was the problem, it was the choice of material and here that choice is just not very good"
4,Great Music,"I've been looking to purchase this CD for some time now. When I first bought it, I owned a Walkman, and didn't even think about CD's then. Of course when I thought about what parts of my collection to restock, the Lover in Me crossed my mind.What I love about this CD is that I am a huge fan of LA Reid and Babyface's productions. Lover In Me was but one of the CD's they collaborated on in the late 1980's. Reid and Face did the bulk of the production. There are also tracks produced by Prince, Angela Winbush (""Fire and Rain"" is awesome!), and Jellybean.There are many standout songs, and some that blend in. I like the Jellybean song the least (If It's Meant To Last). It isn't a terrible song, but it didn't move me .Standout songs for me are, No Deposit No Return, Lover in Me, Follow My Rainbow, Days Like This, 101, Cool Love, and Fire and Rain.I feel this is a great CD because I still want to hear the songs after all the years that have passed."
2,I will never buy from this company again,"I just spent over an hour on the phone with Sage Software, getting shuffled around to six different people, none of whom helped. I've used Act for many years, but the 2006 version sucks. It takes 25 seconds to launch, even on a fast computer with tons of RAM. Twice, I contacted their tech support, which was overseas (another thing that ticks me off), and they were completely unhelpful.Next, I get a notice to upgrade to 2007. I just ""upgraded"" 2 months ago! So my call to Sage today was to see about getting a refund for 2006 and getting 2007 instead. After this whole crummy experience, they've told me I have to talk to someone else. Forget it. They've lost a customer. I wish I'd looked at these reviews sooner."
1,This software can't even ACT,We upgraded from a much older version of ACT! (which was fairly good). The 2006 version really stinks to high heaven. It's so incredibly slow that we are exploring other software...it's been almost unusable. Don't waste your money.
1,Avoid the Nightmare. This should be called DOG!,"I have been using ACT! for over 14 years and have found it a reliable and great contact database. HOWEVER, here comes Sage to buy this great product and they have managed to turn a great product in to a DOG! It is extremely slow and the implementation of SQL server at the database server is terrible. I could go on and on. Lost 2 full days of productivity trying to make this thing work. Thank God I kept my Act! 6 database. I really feel like sueing a company for messing up a product so badly."
2,Act 2006 does not perform. Painfully slow.,"I was a satified Act user until the introduction of Act 2005 which was painfully slow & quirky. At times it does not restore when minimised.I upgraded to Act 2006 which was a fatal mistake as none of the initial problems were resolved. I am using an Intel dual core processor at 2.8GHZ & 1 gig ram which has had a major impact on system performance but 0 improvement on Act 2006.Technical support is expensive at US$50/10minutes & the web site is not much help & requires endless logons.They have a list of settings to change to ""improve performance"" but these changes had no effect.I expect the same pertformance & support from Act as I receive from Symantec, Intuit, Papetrport10, Picasa, Skype & other products but it appears that Act is not responding to its critics.There are very few updates emanating from Act.I will not upgrade to any future versions until it is clear that they understand user expectations."
1,ACT 2006 Aspirates,"I've used every version of ACT and several other Contact Managers as well. ACT 2006 is extremely slow and causes my 1.4/512 Thinkpad to frequently choke as it strangles system resources. What a shame. No fixes available yet (ever?) and from what I've read, SAGE is in denial about the problems."
1,If you are a Sys Admin Beware!,"This review is for the Sys admins:ACT installs Microsoft MSDE (free version of SQL) for each computer running ACT. The problem with this is if you install the centralized database on a server and want to backup the SQL Instance, it wont let you! You cannot use the SQL Enterprise Manager to open the instance. The only user that is allowed access to the instance is the ""sa"" user. ACT does not want anyone to view their tables unless you buy a special program from them!Its a nightmare backing up ACT. You cant copy and paste the database from one computer to another. When you create a new database in ACT, ACT stores something in the SQL instance. So if you copy the ACT db to another computer and click File -> Open Database, and choose the ACT db, it will give an error. I am not sure if there is an automated way to backup ACT but I hope there is.BEWARE!"
1,DON'T DO IT!!,"I've got experience with every version of ACT! since 2. All were good except 4, which had problems, but nowhere near as many problems as 2006 and 2007. Just read the user's reviews on Amazon if you want verification. This product's a complete FAILURE. I run a Windows network using a different CRM tool and would NEVER consider using ACT! under any circumstance. The problems I had during its installation and use are myriad, and there's no excuse for BOZOWARE like this. BUY A DIFFERENT CONTACT MANAGER, because this publisher is absolutely dishonest!The 2006 and 2007 versions should be SCRAPPED, the publisher should give all it's customers refunds AND start over. Sell the name to a company that'll do right by ACT!'s formerly good reputation, because they've released TWO POOR VERSIONS IN A ROW!!"
1,ACT 2006 is a NIGHTMARE. Don't buy it !,"I ""upgraded"" to ACT 2006 from ACT! 6.0. The upgrade was endless and filled with problems. Nothing worked properly. I was on with their tech support for days. Templates don't work and scheduling is a chore because the scheduling drop-down is illegible. The scheduling drag and drop feature in 6.0 does not function in 2006. This is an unfinished product - filled with bugs. Stay with 6.0 and save your money until they get it right. Sage should be ashamed of marketing ACT 2006 before they tested and perfected it."
2,"ACT 2006.. if you need help, good luck","just a FYI, do not lose your user manual, cause you are going to have to buy another one from them. they offer a 30 day trial, but does not provide the manual.. come on.. PDF! Their support.. tsk tsk.. seems like they want you to buy the software, then find out you need help.. so you have to rely on them for support and charge for everything."
2,2006 still sucks,"I just downloaded ACT 2006 trial version since I knew that it had to be better than the 2005 nightmare. Although faster than 2005, it's still too slow. It also slows down all other programs on the computer. With the direction this company is headed, I am going to start exploring other options such as Goldmine. Act 6.0 was great but it doesnt sync with the best and most popular PDA phone available (Treo 650). This company is going downhill fast."
1,Warning - Do not install ACT! 2006!,"As a marketing professional, I have used ACT! software for over 10 years. Never have I seen such consumer abuse as the new ACT! 2006 version. The program will rewrite your registry! You will not be able to remove it - plan on spending hundreds of dollars having an IT professional do it. ACT! programs no longer talk to each other, from year to year. Their customer service is argumentative and the hold times are enough to make you pull your hair out (28 minutes to be sent an ""easy-to-understand"" email from India). My IT consultant just told me about a woman who threw away her new computer because it was so corrupt after ACT! 2006 installation (after spending $800 on IT). Do yourself a favor and avoid ACT! 2006 at all costs!"
2,Very Buggy and Lousy Support,"Our six-person office has been using ACT 6.0 for about a year now and we have become increasingly disappointed.The interface is attractive and the sales materials boast of tremendous capabilities. However, as we've come to use the software we have become aware of several problems:- the learning curve is pretty steep -- and all of us have more than a decade experience each in using CM software- The program periodically, and inexplicitly, loses whole sections of calendar data. Appointments made ten minutes ago and ten months ago simultaneously disappear -- though other appointments remain.- Tech support is non-existent, unless you're willing to pay a substantial fee for slow, script-driven, help. (We've also been disappointed to find - on more than one occassion - ACT's tech support people speaking of how bug-ridden and unstable the program is.)Though attractive the program is functionally unreliable."
4,"ACT! 2006-better, but needs very powerful motor to push it!","I've been a user since v2.0 for DOS. Version 2005 was a bomb and sent it back. Started using Goldmine (about year and a half)-it has its own headaches and no support to speak of without paying also.Took SAGE up on their offer for v2006-I'm very happy with it and have purchased a couple of plugins. It's now a very slick program and I love it, but...YOU NEED A LOT OF POWER. I purchased a HP portable with ACT! 2006 in mind and some Adobe Programs: P4-3.4Mhz (1GB front cache)-2GB RAM-7200 RPM HD. I wouldn't get anything less to push this program.I tried it on my older portable P4-1.8Mhz-1GB RAM-5400RPM HD-forgetabout it! You'll have major problems with it as per the other reviews.It's not perfect and there are some bugs, but after using Goldmine and Maxiizer for a time, ACT! 2006 represents a major step forward assuming you are willing to get a new computer or upgrade your current one."
1,program is painfully slow - almost unusable!,I am so disappointed with ACT! 2006 that I am writing my first Amazon review. I have been using ACT! for 10 years! This version is soooo slow. I have done all the recommended database maintenance and integrity checks and I bought a new computer with 1GB of memory. Even if ACT! is the only program open on my new computer it still runs way too slow. This upgrade is really bad!
3,When more is less,"ACT! used to be my contact management software of choice because of it's intuitive interface = a fast learning curve for new & seasoned users alike. Now that they've added all the internal hyperlinks (to compete with Goldmine & Salesforce.com, I guess) the program slows down my entire computer and the ease of simple text copy/paste has been defeated by dialog boxes that open on top of the main windows.. I liked ACT! much better when it was, essentially, Outlook on steroids."
1,I Should Have Listened,"I will concisely state I should have listened to the review comments instead of purchasing ACT!2006. What a horrible product! It is slow, locks up Outlook 2003, and also slows down my entire system.Heed the advice and steer clear of this product."
2,Bye-bye after over 15 years.,"I've had it. A little faster than 2005 version, but I wish I had hung on to ACT! 6. It's been downhill ever since Symantec sold it.Can't get it to sync with my Palm. Some sort of corruption caused me to go to a back up recently. I think it took out my synching apps executable as well.If you have v. 6, stay with it."
3,Use ACT if you like to talk to people in India,"I've used ACT for years, and it's a good program, but unfortunately, they are sending all their customer tech support to India. Unless you are willing to pay for some ""Platinum"" support package, you'll be talking to someone with a very heavy accent who's not NEARLY as knowledgeable about the ACT product as the U.S. based customer support. I'm sure the ""new recruits"" in India are good hard working people, they just don't know the in's and out's of the program."
2,Not Quite There Yet,"Overall, I see some improvements but not enough to justify my return to ACT! Not sure why a great product like this sank like the Titanic. I'm keeping my Prophet 2004 for now. It has amazed me with all the functionalities provided by ACT and yet works lightning fast. Check it out at prophet2004.biz"
1,2006 ACT,"Do not spend a penny on this software (If you can call it software) If 2006 ACT is running, you cannot possibly run anything else. This software boggs everything down and renders you computer basically useless. The software on the surface looks great, however it is impossible to use. STAY AWAY!!"
1,One star only because zero stars isn't an option,"Could not agree more w/ the naysayers. While speed isn't an issue everything else is. Backed up the db - all my phone numbers disappeared. Their email - JOKE. Initially, once in awhile I would open it up and my folders (other than the standard ones) were gone and all the others were empty. Closing email and restarting it seemed to take care of the problem. Then one day, gone never to return. Switched to using Outlook thru Act and same thing. Worked intially, now all my email is gone except when I go into Outlook itself - thankfully they're still there. The PDA version.... another boondoggle. When I clear an appointment it freezes. Continuously. When I reset the Palm the appointment is properly cleared but then when I sync, sometimes that gets updated in the desktop, sometimes not. I understand the rush to market and subsequent bug fixes but this is over the top. My suggestion is to work a paper system before buying this piece of... you get the idea."
1,Act 2006 is a real disappointment,"If there was a way to migrate back to Act 6 I would do it in a minute. ACT 2006 is very slow. I have had to spend about 7 hours with their tech support group just to get to where the registration information would not corrupt, keeping me out of my own files at critical times. I have used ACT for more than 10 years and 2006 is a big step backwards"
1,HORRIBLE DO NOT BUY,So slow wasting a whole sales day trying to get the software to work. Can not believe how slow this is. never again will I by Act.
1,What Happened?!?!,"After the disaster of the previous release, you'd think that Sage/Best would have gotten the hint.Although the latest version of Act! (2006) is slightly better than it's predecesor, it is still way too slow and even slows down all other programs that are running. A simple task like looking-up a contact becomes an exercise of frustration due to it's slower-than-slow processing even on the fastest CPU's.Act! has a great user-interface and a lot of very useful features, it's just a shame that they can never be truly appreciated because of the program's negative qualities.Best to avoid this software until Sage figures-out how to make it run smoother and faster."
1,It's like going from cable to dial-up,"I upgraded to the new ACT! version so it could integrate with Word 2003. Boy, is it sloooow. As the title suggests, it's like going from a cable modem to dial-up - very, very painful. I would not recommend this product. Stay with you current ACT version or try something else."
1,Avoid Like Plague,"The product is terrible, the support is worse. Trying to run ""Premium"" version on SQL. Hijacks SQL server. Sets its own SQL admin password and ACT won't tell you what it is. Need to uninstall SQL (including any other databases you may have running on that server) to re-install ACT. ZERO integration with enterprise backup software. Proprietary scheduler is buggy, buggy, buggy. I have spent two weeks fighting with this software and this ridiculous company. Save your money and your hair - buy something, anything, else."
5,My favorite Wrong Turn..,"I absolutely loved this film from beginning to end, it is without a doubt the sickest and craziest film yet. This is a prequel and starts out in the 70's and explains the origin of the ""Mutants"" although they are really imbreds. I really dont want to say much more as it ruins the plot. There are parts that WILL make you cringe, but you cant turn away like a bad car wreck...It is also strange that a film with the number 4 after it is actually good, but it is!! The acting is believable, the gore is well you shall see, and the setting is just perfect. In my opinion this is my favorite followed by 3,1, and then 2 which so many people like 2 but i found it too silly i dunno. Honestly check this out it is really well done and creepy as you can finally see where the ""freaks"" originated from!!"
2,disgusting Wrong black Lesbian,"I liked the first one , part 2 aswell , third one is ok , but WRONG TURN 4!!! R U kidding me?it was full of crap , disgusting , and stupid plans by girls killing their friend , doing nasty thingsohhh."
1,wow,i could have liked it if it wasn't for the stupidity...there is too many stupid things in this movie...i liked it at first but when they got out the asylum and decided to go back i was like damn...this kind of stupidity isn't tolerable in 2011...if you're dumb like this stop making movies
1,Don't bother,"Wrong Turn was fun, so my boyfriend and I decided to watch the entire franchise. That was a bad decision. Wrong Turn 2 was fun, 3 was painful to sit through, 4 was abysmal."
3,Wrong Turn - in the snow,Short and sweet...it's got some merits to it...it's not perfect and on occasion you can tell the budget wasn't the highest for this installment of the series but it's got a moment or two that horror fans will enjoy. It's worth a screening if nothing else.
3,Title,this movie is good but could done better job but there will be a 5th one cant wait too see it in 2013 {:
1,ugh.,"i suppose i should have known it wouldn't be good, considering what an epic fail wrong turns 2 and 3 were, but i thought taking the story back to the origins would revamp it. i was wrong. to call it a B movie would be a step up, and an insult to good B movies everywhere."
4,Wrong Turn 4,Movie provided an interesting twist. Horror movie fans will appreciate this rental. Worth the $5 so give this movie a shot. Wrong Turn series get better each movie.
2,Meh,"I have loved the wrong turn series since the first one came out. I feel they kept on getting better and better! However, this one was a huge letdown. The acting was terrible, the graphics weren't as goods they could have been, and the characters were stupid and constantly pissed me off with stupid decisions. Plus, it wasn't as gory as the previous movies. :("
3,Heading in the Wrong direction...,It was pretty good considering it took you back to the roots of why this family existed in the first place to be able to do the Wrong Turn Trilogy. Torture scenes had their moments and overall the acting was acceptable... no names that stood out but the cell scene towards the end of the movie was about as lame as it gets for the kid not finishing off the family (of course had he done this there would be no trilogy!). I'm glad this was made to give us a glimpse as to how this tied into the other movies.
4,This is a thriller....,"This is an edge of your seat, anticipating the next move thriller. The very ending had me almost jumping out of my seat yelling at the screen because I had not expected it all to end the way it did. Great movie overall."
5,Awesome Movie....,This movie is awesome. It explains so much about those wack jobs......lol. Great back story line. Nice gore and torture. A lot of blood. I enjoyed it. This is a great addition to the others. This one actually makes sence. Cheap price and fast shipping. Well worth it.
4,Clever....,"For a remake or a part 4 of who knows how many... I think this one was much better than part two whcih was stupid... this one is amazing, scary and gory... only the sickos in this eating people becomes like a stupid movie for teens 12 - 15.... we need to grow up a little in horror films and maybe the industry will start to actually get back to making classics people wanna see again.I always wanted them to redo... ""I know who you are and I saw what you did...."" A lot more phone tag where innocent people are trottled and killed while this psycho paranoid whack job continues to serach for the kid who voices continues to call him and email him... after he has slain his family.... make it good... get out the sex... and drugs.. and actually give us suspense and a thriller with a psychotic killer...."
4,Another bloody movie,I bought this for my wife since she likes all the wrong turn movies. I personally don't care for them but she does and this one is no different she likes it....If you like the wrong turn movies you won't be disappointed...
1,Waste of time.,The only good parts of this movie are the beginning sex scene and the one in the closed hospital. Other than that don't waste your time.
1,horrible movie bored nothing like the others 3,I do not recommend this movie is really stupid and bored i fall asleep when I was watching this movie
3,"Wrong Turn, indeed!","This fourth installment was terrible (of course, in my opinion)! Bad acting, over the top gore, excessive lesbian nudity and hot airheads running around doing unmentionably stupid things. Comparing this to the first installment, why oh why don't they stop making these brainless distructions of a fairly good movie? I NEVER have done a review before but after this movie, I needed to share with other that I won't be able to get back the hour and a half I spent watching this one! 2 1/2 stars is all it gets."
2,I wouldn't if I were you,"Wrong turn 2 and 3 were sooo terrible that I couldn't even watch them for more than a few minutes.You know a movie is terrible when you can't even at least bring yourself to fast-forward through it.The real Wrong Turn was to allow inexperienced children to continue making terrible movies.So, it was just so wrong to even think about making another.Stick with the first film and don't lower your standards.Falatin"
2,Getting worse as they go,This was truly just blood and gore! There really wasn't even suspense. Just blood and gore and more blood and gore...
3,"A ""WRONG TURN""","Movie was good for those like me who just loved to be grossed out! But,even though I did like it. It just didn't have that ""zing"" of the prvious films.Very wild ending....Wrong Turn 4: Bloody Beginnings"
1,Just terrible!!,"I watch this crap on the syfy channel and it was so bad that I wanted to call syfy and cuss them out for broadcasting this crap on TV...beside it having beyond terrible acting, the plot is stupid and most of the scenes are very dark and you cant see nothing but people teeth when they talk...please dont waste your time buying this garbage...its will be a hour and half of your life you will never get back"
5,great vacuum,"We have had this vacuum for a few weeks and we really like it alot. It has great suction and adjusts automatically to any surface. I even use it to vacuum my ceramic tiles. It is very light for a vacuum cleaner this powerful and has a long cord. I can clean my whole bottom floor with out having to change electrical outlets. It folds down flat to clean under beds and coffee tables which is a nice feature. It is very well built, I don't think I will have to replace it every 5 years like my other vacs. We also have a cocker spaniel that sheds alot and the Sebo does an excellent job of picking up hair. The bags are expensive,but we had a bagless vac last time and the hastle of emptying out the dust cup and sometimes spilling it inside my home made it worth it to me to pay for the bags."
1,Baloney,This is a rehash of a lot of old conspiracy theories that have been around since an individual named Otto Eisenschiml popularized them in the 1930s. A lot of these theories have been debunked since then. As far as I can see the author never really addresses these arguments. I agree with another reviewer that Willam Hanchett's The Lincoln Murder Conspiracies is a much more balanced presentation.
5,Tremendous,"If all this is true, and the author's certainly make a compelling case that is, then everything I was taught in high school about Lincoln's assassination is very wrong and Jim Bishop's book THE DAY LINCOLN WAS SHOT could use a serious update.In addition, the parallels to how things work in Washington today are unmistakeable. I'm not sure whether it's comforting to know that political spin and coverups are an American tradition"
1,Spurious sources+nonexistant reasoning=Bad history,"This twaddle isn't worth the match required to burn it. Not a single source ""original"" can be verified in the original manuscript. Those sources that refer to anything near accepted are so vauge that they cannot be pinpointed. This is David Irving-style research of no value except as toilet paper."
4,Don't believe a gullible critic,"Tom Thatcher has obviously read the recent North & South article slamming this very good book, although he uses that article's arguments as if they were his own. He also fails to note that the authors of that article, Ed Steers and Joan Chaconas, are hardly unbiased individuals: Steers has the arguments of his own book to protect, while Chaconas, who works at the Surrat Museum, has her job and myths that enable it to protect. Nor does Thatcher note that the article was based on a brief and hardly thorough review of Neff and Guttridge's extensive evidence. Instead he says--and it's possible at this point to speculate that he didn't even read this book--that Neff and Guttridge can't get their facts straight, whereas it's clear that Thatcher can't get his straight. I would recommend you read the book and decide for yourself."
4,Another entry for what is arguably the best introduction to Mathias' orchestral oeuvre,"Another entry for a CD which I have reviewed here:Mathias: Symphony No. 3/Helios/Oboe Concerto/Requiescat, and arguably the best introduction to the composer's orchestral oeuvre."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"I'm a fan of many other Reba McEntire movies, but this made-for-tv production doesn't do justice to her talents. Director David Jones didn't get the best out of veteran actors Keith Carradine, and Donald Moffat either. The characters appear staged and their reactions exaggerated. The storyline is very stereotypical and lacks depth. Actress Genia Michaela gives a surprisingly good performance even though her character is the typical good girl gone bad, who redeems herself in the end. The image quality of the DVD is very grainy and the audio has a slight hiss in the background."
5,"Utah jazz, controller, ps2, game","GREAT product, works great, looks great, my son LOVES it! Great quality for the price."
1,One of the most mannered vocalists around,"His credentials are interesting, his song selections okay, but it's tough to get past the slurred, affected vocals. Many of us are afflicted with boring, choir-boy voices well into adulthood, but it doesn't work to mumble, breathe, and whinny by way of manually distressing a second-rate instrument. As Boy George once bravely admitted in an interview years back, there are singers and there are stylists (and he said he was one of the latter). Lovett is a stylist, and it'd be interesting to hear him drop the charade-- but then he'd probably lose his core audience, I suppose, and some of the stars in his rating on this site. He's a Texas-issue Billy Joel."
1,Didn't want it,"I asked amazon not to ship this item, because I mistakenly ordered a cassette..........You shipped it anyway..........I got a refund, but not for my shipping..........My email to you not to ship was well before the ship date..........When I sent you a request not to ship, I got no response........John B. Parker"
1,Master of mediocrity,"Lyle proves on this album that it does not take talent *or* looks to sell albums. This is more preservative-filled product mass produced for his moderately sized fan base. Tenative, strained, whiny vocals. cliche' filled lyrics. A needy grasping attempt to incorporate the most superficial aspects of folk and country music without any of the life experience that goes along with it."
4,Lyle Lovett and His Large Hair?,"What is not to like about this album? It's a mix of jazz, country and Texas swing. Some humorous lyrics. Give it a listen."
2,Not the one,"The ad picture shows a different CD than the CD listed. Therefore I ordered a CD that was more country/western than I like. Swing Jazz, which I was expecting from the CD I thought I had ordered was really missed, my bad. I'll look closer next time."
3,Lyle Lovett,"Bought this on high rating found on internet. But I must say, it is not my favorite Lyle Lovett cd. It is just okay to me. Other Lyle Lovett fans may really like it. I just feel that some of his other cd's are better."
3,Good Album just nothing special,"A friend gave me this album and I'm glad she did. Lyle Lovett is hugely talented and I enjoy his music. All the songs here are well performed, recorded & produced. There's just not all that much that registers with my ears and heart to make it ""special"". I have a feeling that fans of Lyle Lovett probably enjoy the album more than I do. While I do like him and this album, I wouldn't call myself a fan. The songs of his that I like, I like a lot, the rest, good, but kind of... ho hum."
4,LYLE LOVETT GREAT SOUND,"This CD was given to me as a gift. I was confused but after a listen, thank you , thank you. Lyle Lovett and this big band set up is great. Something different and I like it. Sample NOBODY KNOWS ME or WHAT DO YOU DO. Nice stuff folks. If you are like me and not familiar with LL, try this one. Maybe you will become a fan like me. RECOMMENDED"
3,"Five star book, 3 star reproduction quality","This classic book on the large format photography lens is a must for serious enthusiasts. I have used my local library's copy so much that I decided to buy the book. Boy, was I let down when it came from Amazon.com. It turns out that this is a poor quality reproduction, the original plates having been lost by Academic Press. The text and line drawings are OK, but the halftones stink, and I am disappointed that I paid $51 dollars for this book. It should be described on the Amazon web page as a reproduction-grade book and should be priced at $24.95."
2,Guilty of errors its authors accuses businesses of makingn,"The collection of articles from 1991 to 1996 primarily focuses on differently seeing in manufacturing. They have missed a major discontinuity, and used the fatal strategy in a time of change - listening to the HRB customer's needs, the Hardware industries, with no prescience of E-commerce or Web as vehicles for innovation. Harvard B School, like Sears, had missed the change"
5,Message of Hope,"Linda Strom's book convicted my spirit as a believer and reiterated the message of forgiveness in a way I never thought of before. This book is not about the Death Penalty but a message of hope to all people. God wants us to be set free from the bondage of unforgiveness so that we can be right with Him and to experience true peace and joy. Karla Faye's life was an excellent example of that. Regardless of where you have come from, this book will be a blessing to anyone!"
4,Radiance,"Great story about a real woman whose face shown with a radiance that only comes through knowing the forgiveness and peace of Christ. The author doesn't sugarcoat the crime, and she doesn't downplay the miracle of transformation that took place in Karla's life."
3,Bit Overly Religious,"A book I enjoyed though it is religious based and that can be a bit much at times.If you don't mind that, it is an inspiring story of faith."
5,The Legend Mackinnon,"I usually do not leave a review of the books I order, but this was one of the best books I have ever read!! The story centers around three brothers from the 1700's who have been cursed to learn a lesson about love. Duncan , the middle brother is cursed to haunt a North Carolina mountain cabin near where he and his former bethrothed died. The youngest brother Rory is cursed with immortality. The eldest brother Alexander is sent through a time portal where he spends the past seven years in modern times. The each of the three brothers encounters one of three female cousins who just happen to be descendents of the women who cursed them. I won't give away any more of the plot than that, but I have to say that Part 4 of this book had me in tears! If you like time travel romance, you will love this book!"
5,Great resource,"This book has great illustrations, tips on dressing/preperation, and good, reasonable recipes. This is actually a second copy bought as a gift, as we like our copy so much."
2,history book,"I was hoping for a book that focused on the people and their stories from the holocaust, but this read more like a dry college history book."
3,Not very loud,So it's 97 dB with a microphone right in front of the speaker... big deal. It can barely be heard with the generator on our truck running. We've left it on until we find something better; at least it can be heard by someone standing directly behind the truck within a few feet of the speaker. It is a toy for someone who wants to pretend they need a backup alarm.
4,backup alarm,don't recommend its use in quiet neighborhoods. very very very loud.it has the ability to irritate the neighbors. yeah team.
3,"Sub-Standard Alarm, Not Weatherproof","This alarm is decent enough for pedestrians in completely dry conditions. It is not audible from more than maybe two carlengths away though. I doubt it is audible at all to drivers with AC or their radios on.When it rains, the alarm is significantly muffled and is barely audible from the front of the vehicle (mounted behind rear bumper).I will be purchasing a new alarm when I get the chance.This works well to alert pedestrians but other than that, not too great. It's also partially my fault since i didn't realize that 97dB was relatively quiet.Recommended for lightweight uses or just for alerting pedestrians. I would mount it in a way that you can prevent ANY water from getting inside the speaker.For alerting other vehicles, turn to alarms with higher dB ratings and with proven weatherproofing."
2,You Pay for What You Get,"I ordered this book for my company (a sales company). I must say that I think it was a waste of there money. This book gives one letter per occasion. Now this may sound like a pretty good deal, but not when the letter is only 10 lines long.Basically the book is just to vague and non-specific. It's a start, but if you want to finish your letter, I hope you have backup.Book Bias, IL"
5,smells like vicky secret,"everyone at work loves this perfume so much, I even had to get some for a friend. It smells like the old vicky secrets perfumes from back in the day."
1,incompetence,"I love the perfume, I knew this before i went looking for it. I ordered a 3oz bottle for about $42 i believe. I was sent a 1oz bottle and still charged the $42. I emailed cherryland and called to complain, it has been over a month since they said that they would call me back. I would not suggest buying from this company, though I would suggest Happy Heart Perfume."
1,Bad Bad Bad,"Don't know why I downloaded this, I guess I was in the wrong frame of mind. But this movie did not offer any useful content."
4,a girls gone wild knock-off,"it basically follows some wet t-shirt contests around. Not the best looking women, but there's some sexy dancing, wet t-shirts and lots of topless action. Some full frontal dancing too. Its worth a few bucks."
5,The Meditation book that united me with me inner self,"This has got to be the best book ever for meditation that I have ever been able to find. Jessica Macbeth hits it right on the nose. She has taught me to see my inner being in such a way that I never dreamed possible. The only problem I see is that it is so hard to find. I want to get this book for everyone, about 25 people, in my Bible study group. Well, I hope they will start republishing it, soon. You will love it if you can find it."
4,A Review From an 8th Grader,"I am in 8th grade and my new school made us all get clear backpacks (Ugh) So I ordered this one. It's pretty small lengthwise >.< But it can hold 4 spiral notebooks, a binder, and 3 books :) Plus the front and side pockets come in handy. So if you need a clear backpack, and in grades K-8, I'd definetly recommend this one."
1,Flimsy zipper,"Just purchased the bag which I wanted for its see-through quality and in the 1st week the zipper on the outside pocket broke. This week, the bottom of the bag started to split open at the corner seam. I thought I'd be able to use the bag for at least a year. Don't buy it unless you just want to waste your money."
1,Zipper ripped,I ended up returning this Back Pack. The lower zipper (teeth of the zipper) was ripped. The Back Pack appears much larger in picture.
5,raceday,the clear back pack worked great for a dover nascar race . did not have to empty anything and allow them to see right though . great bags .
3,"Great stats, less history","This book is a must for the hockey fan's library. The WHA reflected the 70's in which it played: anti-establishment, fast and funky. This book is tremendous as a statistical resource both for the players and teams. The brief league and team histories are interesting as well. However, if you want more of a flavor of what the league was like beyond the statistics (much like ""Loose Balls"", the book about the ABA), you may be a little disappointed. The other drawback is that there are no ""action"" photos. However, the exhaustive statistical history and amount of interesting trivia make up for the lack of historical depth."
5,A must for WHA stat geeks and afficionadoes.,"The first and most complete account of the old World Hockey Association of the 1970s. The author has included every stat on the league with a few interesting stories along the way. If you are looking for the most complete statistical account and encyclopedia on the WHA, this is it!"
1,"Disavowing the contents of ""Stars over Haiti""","Please change the word ""frother's"" with the correct word ""brother's"" at the bottom of the second paragraph in my review from August 30, 2003. Thank you."
1,A work of almost pure fiction,"I have spoken with a brother of the co-author of this book and he has assured me that the book is one of almost pure fiction insofar as it describes him, his parents, his children or any of the events in their lives. The book should therefore be read as one of fiction and nothing else."
1,As good as the worst mistake,"When facts count a book is as good as the worst mistake.When you find one you wonder: how many others there are ?He states:""The earliest known representation of the new family of instruments is this frescofrom the 1530s on the cupola of the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Saronno, Piedmont,""Now, saying that Saronno is in Piedmont, is like stating that Cambridge (MA) is located in Alabama."
5,Dead Run by Erica Spindler,"Great book! Quite a page turner, keeps you on the edge of your seat!! Erica Spindler rocks!! This is one of the best books I have ever read!"
5,Truly a remarkable novel,"I have been reading Erica Spindler since she started writing suspense, and I have to say this is her best yet. She continues to top herself. In this story, the heroine, Liz Ames, goes to Key West to find out what happened to her sister, who left Liz a mysterious phone message before vanishing. The police in Key West are less than cooperative, not agreeing with Liz that her sister is a victim of foul play. And there are other dark mysteries here that begin to draw in Liz herself. I could not put this down, and when I turned the last page I was shocked and extremely satisfied. Give yourself a nice quiet day and read this book in one sitting. As always, Erica Spindler is a wonderful treat. I eagerly await her next book and only wish she were triplets!"
2,This book had potential.,"Unfortunately, this book did not live up to it's potential.The female lead is about as believable as a flying cat. She's determined. She's confused. She's strong. She's weepy. She's so doggone annoying.Equally as annoying is just about everyone else this book. The characters jump back and forth between views with no credibility whatsoever. If one person would pick an opinion and stick with it throughout the book you might have a decent read here. But they don't.I suggest you skip this -- it's like eating a rice cake: Sounds like it should be good for you but tastes like cheap cardboard."
3,Not Up To Par,"I usually love this author's books, but I honestly wonder if this one was ghostwritten by Heather Graham. From the Key West setting, to the annoying habits (fisting and flexing fingers constantly), the the overuse of some words for emphasis (tossing them into inappropriate places to punch up dialogue), I could've sworn that was Graham's work all the way. However, this book at least kept you turning the pages, which Graham's rarely do anymore.Hopefully Ms. Spindler will return to normal with the next book."
3,Dead Run,This is not her best and I was surprised. I liked it enough to read it through though. If you are an Erica Spindler fan you should give it a try. Could have been the subject material I was not fond of.
1,Great,"Great book , one of my favorite authors. Her books are always a page turner. Can' t wait for a new one."
3,"I love this author, this book was very good, not great!!","I read alot of her other books and they each grabbed you right from the start. I read this one, and it did start good, butI kept going because I knew the author and her style of writing and how I liked all her other books.It was okay- good, not great. The characters were alittle weak as compared to her characters that usually ""haunt"" you after you finish the book. The end had a interesting twist, but not the twist like the other books all had.I liked this book, I would recommend this for a ""casual"" read, but for a real shocking murder mystery, pass this one by."
4,"Great beginning, weird ending","This is a very fast paced story, as are all of Erica Spindler's book that I have read so far. The characters aren't as strong as in her past books, but they are still pretty well devoloped; only occasionally acting out of character. The end of the book is the only part that I didn't like. The true identity of the killer just didn't seem plausible to me, nor did the killer's sidekick. All in all a good book, but the ending was a bit of a let down."
4,Run for your life,"This is another great thriller from Erica Spindler. When Liz's sister Rachel leaves a chilling message on her answering machine, it was the last time she heard from her sister before she disappeared. Now Liz's compelled to go to Key West and check out the church she was a pastor at. From there, things go awry. Someone commits suicide. And a teen Rachel counseled is found there. It's up to Liz to find out, why isn't everyone helping her find her sister, except for Rick Wells, a journalist who investigated the ""New Testament"" serial killings. Together, they find the truth of the secret cult in the church, and were shocked to find out who was behind it."
5,BLACK WOMEN OF AMERICA,Dr. Darlene Clark HINE is one of my favorite historian. I absolutely love this collection and I am honored to own the set.
3,Black Womenin America: An Historical Encyclopedia,"The encyclopedia is filled with information that some is valid, while some information is not valid. Upon further research I discovered discrepancies - irritating. I bought the encyclopedia for a condense version of information, but ended using to many other sources to validate the outcomes."
3,Not transformed by this book,"I bought this book because of the reviews and I've found myself getting very bored with it, even falling asleep while reading it. There's an entire chapter of her life growing up and that's what put me to sleep and I couldn't figure out how that was relevant to changing my marriage. It made me not want to continue reading. Maybe I need to give it another chance, but I thought by the way the reviews were that my life would be changed through this book. But just doing what God instructs us to do will change my life. I'd recommend "" A Women After God's Own Heart"" 10 times more. That book is life changing."
1,Poor at best,"Karen Long's book is, well, disappointing. It reads as a poorly organized self-promotion. She never fails to remind the reader that she is a ""former-hard hitting journalist,"" or ""drop"" names of celebrities she has known. The self-kudos are unending.I don't know whose fault it is but Karen should contemplate killing her editor, not her husband. The book is disjointed chronologically, and the only useful advice comes from a chapter that summerizes what her pastor taught her. I'd rather read his book.Ultimately this book is sometimes funny but mostly poorly written, filled with self-promotion rather than practical steps for fixing a broken marriage. Most reviews read like sychophantic kiss-ups, like they know the author and can't say anything constructive.If you have a marriage that is actually difficult find something else, you're wasting your time here."
2,Blinkies-Not a good toy-too complex,"My 6 year old daughter wanted a blimkie for Christmas, so she got one and then...It was terrible. It never worked right, and it was VERY difficult to work. Even for me. I do not recommend this toy, that is probably why it is always on clearance at the store."
1,terrible - does not fly 100 ft into the air!!,"although my son is only 5, his dad put it together and tried to launch it off and the highest it got was 5 feet into the air. terrible product, wouldn't recommend. the bullet car is much cooler and worth it."
1,It's a piece of....,"Avoid this piece of garbage! This is called a rip off in a box.First, the front of the box does not indicate that you need to put it together and there are no pictures of the actual pieces that are in the box. As mentioned in other reviews, this is flimsy and cheap plastic. The adhesive strips that come with the ""toy"" don't even adhere to the plastic it is made out of! You will need extra tape and glue to even get this thing together and the picture on the box is clearly a farce."
1,Dissapointing junk,"Bought this Rocket for my sons 4th Birtday and was dissapointed to see that it is nothing like the picture on the box. Took me the better half of the morning to try and assemble. Then once I had it to where none of the parts would fall off when you touched it, we proceeded to try and launch it. What a joke! It went about 20 ft up then came down and exploded on impact! I dis-assembled it and built a better one with some of the parts and came up with one that can actually launch and land without disingrating. Can't believe this company is ripping people off with this thing. Shame on you!"
1,big disapointment,this toy was a waste of money. did not work at all fell apart poor desine will buy nothing else from this company
1,Stay Away !!!,"Wow. Just....wow. What was supposed to be a fun father-son bonding experience quickly turned into a father-only challenge. Designed terribly and difficult to assemble. Much more assembly required than I was hoping for and certainly nothing I'd expect my 9 year old to be able to contribute to. My son certainly learned some new words during the assembly process and I finally had to give up and throw it all in the trash without getting any launch pay-off. I took great pleasure in stomping the rocket into little bits before it hit the dumpster, however. Piece of junk. Even if I had been able to complete assembly, I'm not sure how it would survive past one launching."
2,CRASH AND BURN,WAS UNABLE TO DO THE ASSEMBLY IN THE TIME I HAD.WANTED TO USE IT ON SUNDAY GOT IT ON FRIDAY ANDHAD LITTLE TIME TO DO THE JOB. USED IT AS A MESSAGEILLUSTRATION FOR CHURCH. GOT A FEW LAUGHS. BUT NOT$30 WORTH.
4,Pearcy Ratt n Rolls,"As a pretty big fan of Ratt, I try to pick up everything they have done including their solo things. 'Before and Laughter' offers pretty good renditions of some of your favorites. Worth checking out if you are a fan."
2,"Started as a mystery and ended as a love story, sort of.","It started out as a murder mystery. I was pleasantly surprised. Then, it introduced the ""affair"" and that was it for me. The book became more about desperate housewives looking for love in all the wrong places. Please. Isn't this a little played out? I was not as impressed as everyone else was with this book. The book was overhyped. Sorry, but it's true."
1,Not my cup of tea!,"OK, I must say that I have been eyeing SI's works for a long time. When I saw this pop up on Netgalley, I jumped at the chance to read it. I was really disappointed though. I am not sure if this is the author's writing style or if this book was a fluke, but I found this book to be Peyton Place meets Murder She Wrote. Distressed homemaker in a miserable marriage becomes a sleuth. These books are a dime a dozen and it kind of made me roll my eyes. If it wasn't for my committment to Netgalley to give the book every possible chance by finishing it, I probably would not have finished the book. This author def. has an audience, as she has published many a book. She just wasn't my cup of tea."
1,waste of time,"I was very disappointed.. I have read ""Almost Paradise"" by this author that I enjoyed ""somewhat"", but this book doesn't even deserve the 1 star I gave it.. what a trashy book.. a bored housewife who can find nothing better to do than gossip, sleep with the first available man and get involved in the investigation of a murder... What a waste of my time!! Don't waste your money on this book... it is really trashy!!!"
4,RIP,He was a very talented Musician and vocalist. very underrated and this album showcased his talents. very well rounded artist and he never got his due. he was something else. dug the arrangements and overall Production. RIP to a very Talented soul Brother.
1,Buy This DVD and Get Deceived!,"Wow! The Product Description (above) on the DVD says it all: ""This product is manufactured on demand using DVD-R recordable media.""I'm shocked Amazon sells this obvious bootleg!Avoid this at all costs...Get the REAL George Romero authorized versionNight of the Living Dead 40th Anniversary Editionfrom the Weinstein Company."
4,Family History,"My family originates from Gardner, MA and is mentioned in this book. I remember seeing it on my grandfather's and father's shelves. However the author paints a very broad picture of Finnish Americans as being Socialists, which was not the case with my Grandfather and his family."
4,Very nice Lem showcase,"Though it wasn't the most entertaining book of Lem's, it definitely gives the best span of his talents of any that I've yet read. We get the simply goofy in the first couple bits, and the hard-core philosophical in the GOLEM lectures. This is an excellent survey of Lem's talent, but the individual parts are not his best. The humorous bits are certainly not ""Cyberiad"" or ""Star Diaries"" quality, but they are good nonetheless. The GOLEM stuff is a bit dry, but very intruiging. Overall quite good stuff, so it gets 4 stars. Mediocre Lem though."
3,Imaginary solitude,"No so good as A Perfect Vacuum, Imaginary Magnitude is nevertheless a very interesting books. I love comments on imaginary books, an in this field Stanislaw Lem is a master. The difference with Borges reviews on imaginary books (see Fictions) is that Stanislaw Lem recurs to science and locate most of his visionary plots into the future, where humankind is often not human and sometimes not kind.I recommend this book but also recommend the reader to first (or afterwards) read A Perfect Vacuum."
5,GREAT MIX,I LOVE THIS ALBUM.IT IS MORE THAM BOLERO CLASSICS TURN INTO LATIN RITHMS. SUNG WITH GREAT GIPSY PASSION BY CEGALE AND WITH MAESTRO BEBO AT THE PIANO . IM LOOKIG FORWARD TO CEGALE'S COMING ALBUM WITH THE GRAND MONTSERRAT CABALLE. I'VE HEARD.
3,Not really what I was looking for.,"These heads are well made and the price is certainly worth it. However, they are not what I was hoping they would be. I tried using them on my alesis kit but I think they would have performed better if I had put a piece of thin foam in between the head and trigger. Oh well, looks like it's back to regular single ply remo ebonys."
3,"Highly interesting, but TINY print!","I'm taking a course right now called Philosophy of Mind, and this is one of our textbooks. The topic is fascinating to me, has been for years, in fact is something I have been discussing for years with my philosophy-professor-brother-in-law.But gosh, did they have to use such a teeny tiny typeface? It's giving me a headache! And when they have a quoted passage within an article, THAT is even TINIER! Oh my! Please pass the Excedrin!Okay, given that it's a somewhat sizable book, and HEAVY for its size, and using a larger font would make the book larger - okay, so make the book larger! It could stand to grow a bit! The too-small print is costing you 2 stars! Seriously! I really do have a headache, and it's not from the topic!"
5,Great,Evil Bong 1 & 2 are so silly and b grade but very enjoyable to watch if you are in the right frame of mind
3,Evil stupid,"This is not the most stupid viewing Ive ever done,but very close to it!! And as if #1 wasnt bad enough ,some sick puke said""Lets make another one!"" Gene pool cleaning should be an annual if not monthly event!!"
5,Trance at its best?,"Here we have two guys from Sweden doing what they do best. Their first worldwide release! For me this was a very anticipated CD to get. The first track on the Album ""Love and Desire"" is a sweeping 7-minute floorfiller that is sure to become a clubbing anthem very soon! The beats are hard and keep coming back for more. The melodies are wicked. You'll just have to hear it for yourself. You won't regret it. WennE and DjC rock!"
5,Awesome underground trance coming mainstream!,"I first heard about Trance[]Control on mp3.com, where it became one of my favorite trance bands ever. I just like their style a lot, and the kickin beats. It's highly addictive trance, and it's come a long way. Just over a year ago, I don't even think they had a cd. Gotta love Trance[]Control. The only real problem I see with it (and this isn't even with the cd itself) is the Amazon price! Anyone who likes trance is gonna love this cd."
1,Uninteresting,"I'm a big fan of trance and electronic music, so I was quite interested in hearing this album. To me, it seems the compositions are on auto-pilot. Not one track on this album stuck out as being anything more then automated software generated music -like an auto-chord on a cheap casio keyboard on steroids.I would recommend avoiding this album."
5,Fabulous!,"This is clearly some of the best trance I've ever heard. Beautiful, well-orchestrated melodies punctuated by a deep, pounding bassline. This music is highly danceable. Just crank up your subwoofer and blast it!!! This is fabulous stuff."
5,Finally a balanced view,"I must applaud this author for producing a fine book which takes the pain to explain people and their actions in the light of their times; before we invented the label 'gay'.A lot of reserach went into this work, and it shows. Facts are shown which have nowadays been glossed over by urban myths and have become distorted. I found the book fascinating and full of aspects that highlighted historical backgrounds.Recommended for all who wish to study the facts."
4,fascinating insights to love and life in days of yore,This book provides a fascinating look at what life was like for men attracted to other men in the past - including some of the characters who helped define the current understanding of what it means to be gay. It also shows glimpses of norms that today we would find very strange - guests sharing beds with children and travelling companions shacking up together as examples. This all helps us understand the breadth of human experience on this topic and where we individually might fit within the spectrum.
2,really old book,"I was not really paying attention when I ordered this-has some neat trip report and beta, but these areas have probably eroded down since this book was written"
5,Good book to prepare for the coming judgment,I found that this book was very informative and helpful as to how to prepare for what is coming to America - judgment. I believe the author knows what he's talking about. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to get ready for what's ahead.
2,spiritual?,"very interesting the way Topher Delaney passes her work off as spiritual. in what feels like a sell-out to the new-age craze, the designs feel contrived. the drawings and text suggest some sublime meaning in the works, look closer and the message is a one liner. the designs seem too similar to be real narratives. unless, all of the clients were one and the same."
2,To technical... not good for every day reading,"The book is not bad .. it has good advices but it is to technical... not good for every day reading, it's hard to understand unless you have a background in child development technical words ... I suppose that it's perfect for teachers or psychologists .. in other words .. If you are looking for easy to gather tips in how to discipline your kid, this probably not the book you are looking for.but if you have a PhD. in Psychology or early education or some sort of higher educational background then go ahead this book will fit your needs and intellect!"
3,wordy,"if you're reading this, you're probably a mom. that means you probably don't have much time. this could be much more concise or even outline form would be great. even if it was followed up by case studies or narrative to explain, i never made it through the book b/c it was hard to find relevance in a timely fashion and just became another job to get done versus a helpful book. on the other hand, it has some good info from what i did read and it was highly recommended by a trusted expert on little kids."

2,Inedible!,"I tried to hide this in apple cider, nobody would drink the cider. Don't know what you could put this in to hide the astringent flavor, aside from maybe Frank's Red Hot. Unbearable, what a waste of money!"
4,Great addition to your occult/metaphysical library.,"This book along with Equinox III:10 is fundamental reading for anyone interested in the OTO, A/A/, Thelema, Crowley or just 20th Century occultism in general.To really get a grasp on the above systems, this book completes the base set. It contains a nice mix of Thelemic Holy Books, essays, a journal, OTO documents and poetry. On the positive, it is quite entertaining reading on its own for those interested in this type of material, and serves as a storehouse of knowledge for (intellectually) understanding Crowley's systems."
4,More about Passing on rather than Protecting.,"I thought this book would be chock full of information on how to protect your assets from ruinous or frivolous lawsuits through the use of LLCs or other methods. Although the book does touch on this, by far, the bigger emphasis is on creating revocable trusts to streamline the inheritance issues and the many risks of poor planning in this area. It would be better titled ""Passing On Your Financial Assets"" and as such it would be an excellent 5 Star book on estate planning. However, I can only give it 4 stars since it's called ""Protecting"" which I found a bit misleading."
2,Todd is fragile!,"My granddaughter has hundreds of Polly Pocket pieces and many dolls, but she wanted a male doll, so I bought Todd. While she was trying to change his clothes, Todd's head came off, then his chest broke in two, and since the chest held in place the arms and legs, Todd was in more pieces than Humpty Dumpty. My husband is gluing him back together, but I don't know that he will be as playable. I don't understand why Todd was not made of the same quality as the other dolls. We have never had a Polly Pocket doll fall apart before."
3,A good history of 19th century Spain and up to 1936,"Only for those with an interest and some background in Spanish history and politics. Sets the stage for the Spanish Civil War (1936-39). Well written and readable; the English author uses research as well as first-hand experience to paint the complex mosaic of Spanish political factions. In the last line of the epilogue he condemns the English policy of appeasement toward Hitler of allowing the Spanish Civil War to take place by not imposing an arms embargo against Germany. The Spanish fascists were allowed to import German arms and thus, eventually, maintain superior firepower over the Republicans.Another piece in the history puzzle; worth reading."
5,"Reflective Marker, blue",Blue reflector marker seem difficult to obtain in any quantity; I bought all they had at the time of purchase. This style has a quite heavy duty rod for insertion which is much more robust than the twisted aluminum one which bend so easily just installing.
2,"Cute, but painful.","While this piece is very cute, it won't fit everyone. When I put it on, my nipple fit through the opening just fine, but because of how the holes are positioned, I couldn't get it down far enough to line up with my piercing. I had to do some annoying maneuvering to get the barbell through, and afterward it was very uncomfortable to wear, and I experienced stinging pain whenever the barbell shifted because it stretched out the area too much. I had to take it out after two days. It seems like it's designed for someone with, erm, ""long"" nipples. Give it a try, but just remember you can't return it after you open the package."
2,Hard For Child To Understand,We purchased this book for my daughter with her guitar. She is a bright girl and had a very hard time understanding it. Even we didn't understand much of it and we have played instruments!I would pass on this book and purchase one from a musical instrument store.
2,Frustrating CD - makes it hard to tune your guitar!,"The book itself it pretty good, but the CD has some flaws. The first track is to tune your guitar. It would have been better to make each string a different track to tune each separately, but instead it gives you three plucks to tune each string from the lowest to the highest note. If you need more time however, you end up starting over, and this can take a very long time to get through! There is no actual instruction on the CD, it must be used with the book as it is just musical accompanyment and demonstration of the chords, no words. It would have been nice if the book came with a pick. The guitar didn't come with one either, so now I have to find a music store to purchase one."
2,Not all that helpful for the novice,"I purchased this book along with a guitar for my 6 yr old at Christmas. Based on the description and recommendation from others I assumed that it would be a good starter guide and she would at least learn where to put her fingers, etc. It may be helpful for practice once she has a private lesson or to, but until then its not helpful at all. I have no musical experience, but as an adult I can't even understand what its trying to tell me. The CD just plays the music so there's no instruction there either. I was disapponted."
2,Spend a few extra dollars on a book that is worth it,"I puchased this book at the same time as a martini shaker and thought it would be a good companion to my new shaker and glasses.This books is very small, flimsy and posseses a lot less than than can be found at a basic drink website. ...the book is cheap BUT it is worth about $2, thats it. In looking through this book, I felt like I could have put together something better written, more informative, and thorough in about 2 hours sitting at the computer.There are some good recipes in the book but most of them are variations of the same martini. I would recommend skipping this book and buying one of the other drink/martini books that cost a few $ more."
3,Maybe as a gift with a shaker?,"I can only see this being a good book if given as part of a *martini-themed* gift basket... On the other hand the book *shaken not stirred* is much more fun, useful and informative...The recipes here are good, but standard...nothing to warrent an entire book, really. It would look attractive, tho, as part of a gift set...so its kind of a mixed bag.If your looking for a book for yourself... a first martini book with recipes, tips, sayings and martini lore, go with the other one i mentioned."
3,A bit disappointing.,"The book is tiny, with cheap binding and mediocre photos. It won't last long around a wet space like a bar. As for the recipes themselves, they are just the standards. Ho hum."
2,Don't bother,This book is more cute than useful. If you drink martinis you can probably come up with most of these on your own.
1,Bad Quality,The qyality of these earbuds is awful. I can barely understand the words in the music I am listening to. As for bass: non-existant. Don't buy these unless you're deaf.
1,***AVOID AT ALL COSTS***,...unless the cost is FREE. This is a collection of live tracks and incomprehensibly bad re-recordings/remixes. Many do not sound remotely like the original artists were involved in any way. NOWHERE on the package does it relay this info. Avoid at all costs.
2,Not So Great,These are not as cute in person! The colors are brighter then I like also the toe is to narrow. I will be sending these back! The product lacked quality especially for Steve Maddens.
2,so-so,"product is attractive, but rather small and of less quality than one would expect for the price tag. Also be aware (as I was not) that the light source requires a conversion to low-voltage, and separate purchase of number tiles. Overall I think the product is highly over priced for what you get."
2,Greatest Hits 3- No wonder Steve Sanders shot himself!,"Buy Greatest Hits 3 even though Steve Sanders sings in 4 of the 10 songs. The other 6 may not be as good as previous Greatest Hits, but they still are worth the while. An unfortunate period for the Oaks as Steve Sanders brings them to mediocrity in the late 80's, but on the bright side a majority of the songs are with the original four and Steve is no longer with the group."
5,A MUST HAVE FOR YOU COLLECTION,"Like the finest of wines...this work gets better with every listen.When I clean out my cd collection ""ALL THE GORY DETAILS"" stays right up front where it belongs.It crosses genres and rocks the generations!!!!!!"
1,Low cost???,"What's the cost of a part when it doesn't fit? You've spent your time tearing the car apart and are now installing the part only to find out the part doesn't fit. The mounting holes on the window motor do not line up. Not even close!! Save your time, Don't buy this chinese crap. Instead take a trip down to your local napa store and get a part that will fit! The only good thing I have to say is that Amazon has a great return policy!"
5,"Easy to install, excellent value",I watched a friend with experience install it and it seemed very easy and straightforward. It even came with interior door clips. I have been using it for a few weeks with no problems. It performs similarly to the original regulator that came with my 1999 Grand Cherokee and cost a fraction of what the dealership was asking for the comparable replacement part.
2,Not as nice as I had hoped,"I bought these cards to thank people for their wedding gifts. Granted it's not always easy to know what you're ordering online, I was disappointed by the printing quality and the card stock.I'm not an expert on cards, but the stock seemed flimsy and thin, and really not much thicker than ordinary paper. The printing itself is inconsistent and I think I could have pulled off the same job on a regular office printer.I'm not going to use these cards to thank people for their wedding gifts. People spent good money on gifts for us, and I feel they deserve to receive a better quality card from us, expressing our appreciation.These cards might work for more casual uses, eg to thank someone for a nice gesture they did for you. I wouldn't use these to thank a client or a boss.Just my 2 cents...."
2,confused,"My fiance and i think they're lovely, but it would sure be nice to know how many are actually in a package!?"
2,not all that hot,"as much as I like martha & the muffins, I have to admit this album only has a few good songs on it. ""Swimming"" is excellent and ""Women around the world at work"" is perhaps the other strong track. ""One day in Paris"" is a beautiful track as well. But three good tracks doesn't give the album quite enough to make it noteworthy. This album did mark progress in the right direction for the group with the next three albums being progressively better. The next album that came out was Dansparc, which is a three-star work. Then came their second best work ""Mystery Walk"" (four-star). Then their best album ""the world is a ball"" which is a solid five-star album. The first two martha & the muffins albums unfortunately are one star."
1,Leaves A Bit To Be Desired,"The author gives some good information, but she lightly touches over topics leaving the reader with a lot of questions. The book is rather pricey with not a lot of content. I found several typos that should not have been missed before printing. For the price of this book, I think that it would be wise to look at other ""For Sale By Owner"" books."
2,A Meteor Shines Brightly,"A majority of the essays in this book are quite well done, but a few shallow efforts such as Alethea Sayers' quite-clearly poorly researched article leave gaping holes in the text. Cartwright's effort is well-presented and Joselyn's article, while written with readability in mind leaves the reader with more questions than answers. A consistantly written biography of Cleburne would be preferable to this halting, sometimes good, sometimes bad collection."
3,"It works better than typical spay shaving cream, but it's heavier that the Proraso or Omega menthol cream.","Get the Proraso Eucalyptus & Menthol (green). Omega makes one too, and I thought this was it. It wasn't. This is just Eucalyptus. This type is heavier and doesn't seem to lubricate my skin as well as the eucalyptus and menthol type. Proraso color codes their creams by type. Omega's creams all come in black containers. The containers are slightly different shapes, but it's difficult to tell online. I suggest getting the Proraso to avoid any confusion."
4,Smooth shave,"Excellent product, smooth and close shave all the time. Also sensitive skin sufferes, no problem. Never going back to a can again...."
4,Very Awesome!!!,"I just got this a couple days ago and I have to say that I'm so thankful that there are Yu-Gi-Oh episodes that I can watch wherever!!!!! I think that there should be all four parts of the duel on the cartridge, since it starts on part 3 which is right in the middle of the duel. I don't have a GBA SP, so I couldn't tell you if the picture quality was better on there. I just have a regular GBA, and the picture is kind of blurry and you have to have enough light to see the entire picture correctly. But other than that, It's a great product and I can't wait for volume 2!!!!!"
5,one of the best ways to watch episodes,i think it is cool how you can watch these on the G.B.A but why didn't they put in part 1 and part 2 instead then if they make a volume 2 they could of put part 3 and part 4 in that one but i think it's great and i give it 5 stars
1,cute premise.. not so great execution,"I was hoping for a new author to enjoy, and I read the jacket thinking this would be pretty funny. I started reading, thinking Anton would be a fun character to know... how does a preacher decide to start imitating Elvis? Instead, Anton kind of faded away, Paris sulked a lot, Pruitt was too good to be true.. and not necessarily in a good way. I found I did not like the characters and I found myself disappointed with the development of the story. I would almost like to ask that Ms. MacPhearson revisit the premise and rewrite this tale in the light she set it up in rather then delving into such murky waters. I sadly cannot review how this tale ends as I was not able to make it that far and dropped the book into the donate pile."
3,"Not the best, not the worst","I got this because it was free and I needed a kindle book to read during my ample down time working backstage.I kept feeling like I was reading way below my level and that this was fluffy girl stuff with overused themes.That said, it wasn't the worst book because I finished it, but had I not been stuck in a tower backstage with 25-45 minute breaks I would not have read this ever."
2,Yeah... no,"I've had this book forever and it took me awhile to finally pick it up. First I can tell you that the book is shoved with to much of... everything. You have the couple to deal with. You have the wedding. You have the fact that he's an Elvis... not the real one but you get it. And you have to deal with the fact that Paris has a whole lot of issues. Not to mention a little mystery on what happened to her mother and Sarah, a long lost ""friend"" of ""Elvis"" whose in love with him. Honestly there was so much going on in the book that I didn't even realize that I didn't like that main characters until I started to like them more.... don't know if that made any sense or not.The book has romance and yet you don't really see the romance. A lot of it is covered up over everything else the characters have to do. It's just not a good book. The author tried to make it creative and in the end she just made it to creative, with to much going on."
1,Not a good read,"I have to agree with other reviewers, I expected a light hearted read. The main character just came across as bitchy, self-centered. The hero was just to syrupy sweet and patient to be real. Post-partum depression is no laughing matter and in this book just made me feel glum, just having to read over and over how bad her childhood was. I was very disappointed in this book."
3,I read a lot of memoirs..,This one was written fairly well about the authors father decent into Alzheimer's Disease. I guess I expected more.
1,Not in good condition,"The book doesn't work - sound wise.Pages are colored onShould have checked at half priced books first.When our son found it in the office he was excited to see all the ""Trucks"" but when it didn't work like his other books like this he just walked away :("
3,Latin music by Latin People PLEASE!!,"I am from Mexico, and I have heard all these pieces many times. Except for Salon Mexico, which I think thay do very good job, the rest lacks a bit of flavor. I noticed it the most on Huapango, particularly on the discussion between the trombone and the trumpet. The musicians at the Boston Pops are too well-trained. They have gorgeous phrasing, but that takes away the flavor of the moment. They are supposed to be insulting each other, not singing to each other. I do think that it is a good way to introduce the world to this music. It has been recorded almost exclusively by Latin American orchestras, and they have not been so comercialized as this recording will be."
3,I agree with the music fan from Mexico,Where's the authentic Mariachi CDs? Let's have some of the real stuff! Anyone know where I can find some? LibbyBuckland@email.msn.com
3,"Good background music, but a little tame for latin",I expected a little more action. I tend to think of mariachi and I got village pan pipes.
2,Disappointing,"I have to give Kai much love and respect, but this CD disappointed me. I have their first CD and I could listen to that CD the whole way through and enjoy each and every song. I'm sorry, but I can't say the same about this CD. I found myself skipping songs and then listening to the songs to see what I missed and then skipping them again. There are only a couple of songs on the CD I like. I should have just bought the singles. Damn."
4,Hellz Yeah!,"This is one of the most underated foundation out there, I speak from experience and the fact that I have a makeup addiction.It gives a medium to full coverage with a satin finish. It goes on like a dream and stays put. You must give this a try, very much worth it."
5,Great setting and well written,I bought this for setting information and ended up liking the Wraith setting so much that I also got the main Wriath book. Great setting for any Stortyteller and it have good artwork also.
2,Mr. Twist,"Let's Go Bowling is a traditional ska-pop band from the USA. I first saw them play in 1997. When I saw them a second time in 2000, they flipped me off and refused to autograph my CD's. The CD's are in a safe place...a landfill. LGB took a sparkling dump on my hopes and dreams. Anyway, Mr. Twist is a half way decent album."
4,The picture is of a different rounding bit...,"This is only a 1/16"" radius rounding over bit. The picture makes it look like it's around 1/4""...it's not.(See 48-23-7410 or 48-23-7440 for 1/4"" radius versions)"
3,Good but not for Newbie,"I'm a complete self learning artist. I've pretty much learned things on my own and that is one that I did without using a book. I wanted to go into animation and the requirement is that we need to we need to learn life drawing. I bought this book assuming that it would teach me the stuff needed because I thought life drawing is something different. The reality is that I didn't understand much because for me drawing is something done visually and not read and then done. Although the pictures have done some work, but AGAIN, FOR NEWBIE'S, this will not do because you need to have sufficient art knowledge to PROPERLY understand the stuff.One thing keep in mind. This has nude photos, so keep in mind, that it is M rated photos"
3,Used as a Reference Book Only,This was used as a Reference Book only... After going to the Dentist which had the walls covered in Green Man stuff...Wanted to know more ...
2,False in many places.,"As a previous writer stated, this is a modern, or revivalist, book on Druidism. I even hate to write Druidism as it may give the reader a false impression that this subject is connected to the ancient practitioners of old. There is very little information on the true ancient Druids of the B.C.E. era through roughly the 3rd century C.E.. Only glimpses found in ancient Druid burial sites and even Julius Caesars ""Gallic Wars"", though very little is mentioned by him in there. Almost all information that was, and is, gathered by practioners in recent times are from the late 17th century and forward. Not to knock anyone who reads any of this, but, for those seeking the practices etc.. of the ancient Druids, there is no source out there or hope of truly knowing them."
2,Previously Five Stars for the Boehse Onkelz,"I like the music and many of the songs lyrics but, BEWARE, this group has very extreme beliefs and may offend catholics and / or people of faith. Also, I visited the bands web site and read some pretty uncaring words directed towards the U.S. I can only hope that all germans don't share thier views. I am glad that germany aparently shares our love for freedom of speech. Now all the Onkelz need to find is a little diplomacy."
5,If you are willing to accept change you'll love this!!!,"Yet again Ely Guerra has composed an amazing album. True this is a substantially different sound than her previous albums, and it did take me a while to appreciate Sweet and Sour, Hot and Spicy on its own merits. But wow, I spent all weekend listening to the CD and it doesn't get old. In fact, the more I listened to it the more I appreciated the subtle nuances of each song and the way they flowed from one song to the next. This album has a happier light hearted feel to it with definite 50's/60's pop/bolero influences. Ely's voice continues to shine as she sends you into a trance with her sultry voice. I can't reccomend this album enough, I've played it for all of my friends and they have all fallen in love with Ely. Just be aware, this is not the same Ely Guerra sound you heard in Lotofire or Pa Morirse de Amor, this is a new happier Ely and every bit as good as her previous albums."
3,Similar to Julieta Venegas and Andrea Echeverri... but flat and uninteresting,"I first heard of Ely Guerra when she released the single ""Tengo Frio"". Her sound was compelling and sexy. I was immediately attracted to her music. So I picked up ""Sweet & Sour, Hot y Spicy"". While it's not a bad album, it is mostly flat. Combining elements of rock and electronica, the end result shows no particularly outstanding parts, when you listen through it.Though Ely Guerra somewhat belongs in the same league as Julieta Venegas and Aterciopelados' Andrea Echeverri, this album leaves her behind the other two. I am going to be a bit more skeptical before I check out her future works."
4,"""Milk through the nose"" funny at times","Got this book for Xmas just before going on a three-day trip and finished it on the plane in about three hours. GREAT stuff! If you've ever strayed more than 100 yards from your home, you can relate to these tales of disaster, frustration and fear...comic disaster, frustration and fear, of course. Lots of memorable pieces, but the ones that stick out for me are Rolf Potts' great tale of bag-snatching in Thailand; Elliot Hester's battle-royale aboard the San Juan special; and the funniest one of all...a newcomer named Mark St. Amant's sleep-deprived account of a perpetually clog-dancing, karaoke-singing Japanese neighbor in Florence. (Some of his descriptions will have you rolling on the floor and kicking your feet, wondering if he'd been sniffing glue prior to writing it, just like a certain monkey that appears in the story.). All in all, a fantastic read, expecially if you're setting out into the cruel, comic world."
2,Mean-spirited mockeries,"At the beginning, I laughed out loud, and then, reading on, grew more and more dismayed. This is not a book about funny incidents. It is a book often filled with people being humiliated at best and beaten at worst. Hidden within this book are messages of how each culture mocks the other. I found the story about the Egypt border, with the snide Italian boasting, ""You Americans think that you are individuals. In fact, you are not and that is why you cannot understand that someone might hate you for being an American,"" juxtaposed with the crazed American guard on the Canadian border, as more horrifying than funny, and more full of warning that the world is a dangerous place. Okay, this is a political message and if you want to debate them, fine. But don't confuse it with comedy.If you want to keep someone at home, never to set foot on foreign soil, give them this book."
2,Nice title - That's about it,"I picked this book up, because I loved what the editor ""Sean O'reilly"" did with the Danger! Series.But this book was a bust. The stories were not entertaining, some poorly written, and boring to a T."
2,Needs funnier hyenas,"A collection of 25+ ""amusing and hilarious"" stories from various travel writers. Okay, there a some slightly amusing stories in this compendium of travel and the best story is ""The Snake Charmer"". For a best of humor moments, this collection is sadly void of the humor. Not to say the stories for the most part weren't nice little snippets of their travels, but overall it falls far short of being outright boisterious. The high points of interest are Snake Charmer, Monstrous Dildo, and the explosive release while attending a mass gathering of India peoples for a religious observance. Many of the stories range in length of 4-7 pages, hardly enough to get you interested and then they end abruptly. The book is worth reading, certainly, but not one I'm likely to reread. For me, the first half of the book was much better than the second half."
2,A decent effort,"I can't even count how many times I've seen the Pietasters play live in the last 10 years or so. That said, this is not a great album. It does not do the Pietasters justice or give a good idea of how the Pietasters sound. This album is slow, sluggish, and lazy. They plod through each song with no energy. The more I write this review, the more angry I am getting! These are great songs, but they sound horrible on this album. Thank God I've seen them live and know how these songs are supposed to sound. Buy their Strapped Live album instead."
5,Beer Drinkin' Fun !,The Pietasters are totally awesome! I am 15 and went to their concert in DC and I had a great time! They spit beer on the crowd and some fans lit up some fireworks in the middle of the mosh pit! This is definately the band to skank with! Keep Skankin' Baby!
3,THIS IS A GOOD,THIS A GOOD CD OTHER THAN THE FACT HE TALKS ABOUT ASSULTING HIS GIRLFRIEND ON ONE OF THE SONGS BUT IT TOOK A FEW LISTENS FOR ME TO GET INTO IT BUT IT IS GOOD
5,a must for the ska lover,"yikes, this cd rips, its by far the most enjoyable cd ive ever heard, seriously its a treat to the ear. a couple of years ago i found a tape on the deck of a swimming pool, labled ska, and alas to my delight, i poped it in and it was this poorly named delightful album...whata mix, this cd has it all, some sweat well placed horn lines with a lead singer that has a one in a million voice that as you may notice in the samples provided is quite versitile...this pietasters' album is right up there with Hepcats ""right on time"" and the scoflaws ""ska in high fi"" on really the truely comtemporty classic 3rd wave cds. so in general when your through with Reel Big Fish and the punk spawned OC ska scene check this baby out cause it ska the way ska was ment to be played, gawd im glad i found that tape on the ground...also maybe check out the live album ""strapped live"" its a little raunchy and the horn section is obviously drunk as a skunk but its got some classic tracks too..."
5,This is my favorite CD in the whole world!,"I love this CD and the Pietasters soooo much. The only thing that bugs me is that the best song on the cd is Maggie Mae and it's stuck as track three with another song! Oh well, it's still the best CD out."
4,"Great stories, pity about the size","Great book. It was my favourite one in my childhood. Funny, witty, and the drawings were fascinating to my 10-year old mind. Loved it.Pity about the size though - this edition is very very small, which doesn't do it justice. Text and drawings are cramped together.It kind of spoiled the experience for me, as the one I had in my childhood was large, well presented and only had about 1 drawing / story per page.The stories themselves lost none of their charm. Will always remain in my mind as enchanted. I got it for my kids as I wanted them to be able to enjoy it as much as I did. Great addition to any children's bookcase."
1,Not what I was expecting,"The coloring and detail on the horse's head were nice, but overall it was very small and cheap looking for the amount of money that I spent. I was not happy with the product."
5,Awesome toy,"My wife and I got one of these previously for our older daughter, and she loves it, but now that our younger daughter is old enough to notice, they fight over it - got the second one and all is good - definitely recommend!"
2,Disappointed,We already owned the Melissa & Doug stick horse and were looking for two more for our younger kids. We were very disappointed when we opened the package. This toy is much smaller than we expected. I was surprised at how cheaply made it is...it is not very sturdy.
2,Very Disappointed,"I wish I would have read the reviews. First of all the hobby horse's stick wasn't inside of the box, so it was damaged. When I opened the box and took the Fancy Prancer Pony out, I was shocked at how small the head was. I am very disappointed and am going to send this product back for a refund. This was a Christmas present for my granddaughter and now I must start over again to find her a great toy. If you don't want half a horse head, Don't Buy this product!"
3,A bit disappointed,"I bought 2 Mary Meyer ponies. One in purple for my granddaughter. And one is brown for my grandson. They are both good quality; they are both 37 inches. However, the purple horse's head is about twice as little as the brown one. And because I bought both... it's very obvious. The pictures online do not show this accurately."
3,Stick horse,"Our 2 yo loves it at first but doesn't seem to play with it much afterwards. We tend to ride the horse around and makes the kid laugh. The horse's head is on the small side but it does feel soft and has some glittery details which the toddler likes. Would prefer one that is slightly bigger and makes horse noises.9/2012: 3 years later and my kid is still playing with this stick horse. She uses it to prop up stuff, makes a tent as well as all kinds of pretend play. So I think this is a good traditional toy that will last a few years!"
5,HORSE,I WAS VERY PLEASED AT HOW QUICKLY IT ARRIVED AND PACKAGING WAS VERY DURABLE. I WOULD ORDER FROM THIS VENDOR AGAIN. THANK YOU
2,"Boring, Pointless and Long","I would not recommend this book to anyone based on the writing style or conclusions drawn (I disagree with the author on many points). However, there is a lot of research that goes into this book, and it has some value because of that."
4,Very nice,"Not as exciting for me as Angels of Ecstasy 1, but still a very nice collection of spiritual music. Waiting for Angels of Ecstasy 3."
1,Disappointing purchase - Baby Boomer's Retirement Cookbook,Very disappointed in the quality of the book - very few pages - not a good buy for the money. I do not recommend this book.
2,"Cute, but too small, too thin, not very soft","These blankets have cute designs that look great in photos, but I'm not sure what they're good for... They're too small for swaddling, too thin, not very soft, and expensive for this poor quality. At the moment, I have been using Carter's (softer, less expensive -- good for everyday, around the house) and the SwaddleDesigns Ultimate Receiving Blanket (thick, soft, gorgeous for going out) instead."
4,They work,"They work well; however, I was hoping that the construction would be a little better...but then I'm comparing them to some industry grade scissors that cost way more...I guess for a home pair used for general purposes they're ok"
1,Totally disappointed with this product,"This double sided foam tape is described as ""Super Tape"". There is absolutely nothing super about it. After having carefully prepared the surfaces to be taped (by cleaning with alcohol thoroughly) and making sure there was no residual film, the two surfaces (ceramic and plastic) were pushed together and held together for at least two hours with a clamp. This tape released the surfaces within two days. The old tape it was replacing lasted several years (a Scotch product). This tape was purchased because of the size: 3/4"" by 5 feet. Most tapes are an inch wide. Needless to say, I threw the tape away and replaced it with a Scotch product. So far so good. For me this tape was a waste of time and money."
2,Very disappointed,"I have used a similar product for years but was extremely disappointed with this one. The sticking capability is nothing like the one I had in the past. Unfortunately, the company I bought it from in the past is no longer around. Would not recommend this."
2,Disappointing,"I purchased this based on Madhu Tumma's review (Madhu you have changed your identity to MTM). I agree with some of the sections like quorum disk and split brain architectures are well explained, the rest of the book is not worth it.Chapters are not complete (like other reviewers have also indicated), most of the contents are referenced to outside material. Do a search for the string 'step-by-step' on metalink and you will get everthing this book contains. The book contains many incomplete sections and several errors. I searched all possible sources for 'automated freelist' could not find it, what's this? Similarly, cache fusion is better explained in the Oracle concepts document. Overall quality of printing is also bad.Mike I have purchased your earlier books and have liked them however this one is disappointing."
2,"Poor book, just about everything comes out of Metalink",If you are in the process of either installing RAC or learning about it you are better off doing your research on Metalink. If you have the spare money then this book offers you a central place for a collection of different Metalink articles.
5,Excellent coverage,"Since there are not many RAC books to compare, this review is based solely on the coverage of the book content.I found the multi-platform coverage to be excellent, and while I found that some content was very advanced, the complete referenced helped to fill-in the missinh pieces.I found it easy to read and a very useful reference."
2,A badly written book,"The writing has a lot of errors and gramatical problems.Technically I found the book had little to offer as well.It is full of meaningless phrases, with little content that provided an insight into grid computing. I also found the logicalpresentation of the topic confusing and contradictory.Maybe it would suit the less technical reader, it just wasn't what I was looking for."
3,Speed Cleaning 101: Cut Your Cleaning Time in Half,"Too many prose...not a quick read. Prefer the Clean Team and the Campbells books. They are to the point and are not afraid to recommend supplies one can pick up off the shelves of the grocery store. So, I bought the Speed Cleaning book//Campbell and the Clean Team.Speed Cleaning"
1,Highly repetitive book,"This book has some good cleaning advice, unfortunately, I think there is really only enough good advice to fill a 10 page pamphlet. The rest is relentless repetition of the same advice (I think almost every other page advises you to use microfiber cleaning cloths or a flat mop). Another complaint is that the text meanders aimlessly."
3,good but...,this should b considered with other guides in its vien. i've read several housekeeping manuals. don't rely on just this one alone.
2,the story of the first noel,"The product contents is excellent; unfortunately it was used dvds and had flaws, but still, the contents is what counts. The contents is out of this world. Please insist on producing new ones and let me know; I asure you that you will get a lot of new orders. Thanks."
3,I find it overrated too,"Like Ken Wilber, It is not that I am arguing of what actually happened when a psychic/energy healer does her job or the efficacy of her treatment but somehow her outrageous theory of what happened is ofputting. People have different level of intelligence, scepticism and standard of acceptance of what constitutes a good book, and I agree with the other negative viewer that her book is below the standard. If you consider valid criticism of weak and speculative science as illness, psychosis or moral defects as the viewer below seems to believe then you perhaps have a problem yourself. It's either you are not as smart, feeble minded, superstitious or simply don't believe in pluralism of thoughts and taste."
3,Believe it or not,"The premise of the story is real. I ordered the film on the advice of a Brazilian co-worker from Rio; tired of all the ""Brazilian"" films that gloss over the reality of the streets of Rio. Although an older film, the story still rings true today. If you liked this film but found it a bit lacking; rent ""City of God"" AND the Brazilian television series ""City of Men"" (shown a couple of years ago on the Sundance Channel)."
5,"Calling Dr. Comedy, Dr. Larry, Dr. Moe...","Brad Schreiber, one of the wittiest writers in Hollywood, finally comes clean on how to tickle a funny bone until it's blue and rarin' to burst. Oh, if I'd only had this book sooner, it would have saved vital time in my own comedy writing and allowed me the leisure to pursue my badmitton training in earnest. Makes the perfect gift for the wannabe Woody Allen in your life."
5,Excellent Writing Tool,"If you want to write comedy, this is a must read. Brad Schreiber's book not only tells you how, it shows you how.Robert C. DeLay, screenwriter, Cedar Grove Agency Entertainment"
5,"Who, me?!","So someone once asked me, ""Pamela, do you write comedy?"". ""Not on purpose"", I replied.But now, with the help of a really funny guy who wrote a really helpful book, I can make a good go at it.Like Brad Schreiber himself, this book is intelligent, witty, accessible, inspiring, and fun.It offers overviews of various forms of humor, theories of humor, examples of humor, excerpts from humorists, practical advice on writing funny, and even provocative exercises that guarantee at least a giggle, most often a guffaw.As a story consultant myself, I recommend Brad's book to my writing clients.As a reader, I recommend Brad's book to anyone -- writer, speaker, performer -- who wants to lighten their life and the presentation of their message with humor."
4,Scrye Review,"This is a great product! It gives valuable, accurate information for tons of CCG's and many checklists. Althought the system for card organization can be rather confusing at first, after a while one gets used to it and it becomes even easier to locate the cards you wish to have priced! A Great Value!"
4,Not bad...,"I found Mr. Miller's book extremely helpful. I was really surprised to find the Christian game ""Redemption"" in there but was pleased to see it. If you are an avid CCG player you must have this book."
4,Three of the best songs you've never heard...,"...are ""Long Way Down"", ""Touch And Go"" & ""Just Like Heaven"". Really.The rest of the album falls way short, but I'll give it four stars based on the strength of those three tracks."
5,Works great!,"All I can say, - this thing works great! We had to replace ours when one day it stopped working."
2,not so good,"i've been using this cable to connect my HP laptop to a toshiba TV, screwing the cable to the TV was easy, it stayed in place. my HP was not so lucky, cable kept falling off if you as little as touched it. we learned to deal with that, we simply avoided the contact with cable or laptop when it was plugged in. last week the picture got worse, it was not clear and sharp anymore. after using the cable for 8 months it stopped doing its job, the picture kept getting worse each time the cable was used. when we replaced the cable everything was fine again."
4,OK I guess,The cord is long enough but it has an audio cord attached to it which is a good idea. Problem is that the audio cord isn't long enough. When I plug the VGA to my the laptop the audio cord isn't long enough to plug in. I guess they only made it for use on PC's.
1,left handed shears,I cut five t- shirts and after that they quit cutting except at the very tip.I threw them in the trash.what a waste of money.I finished the job with a pair from walmart I purchased for 5.00.
1,These scissors broke with very little use,These scissors did not hold up.They broke with very little use.The lefty scissors appeared strong but do not hold up.
5,a lost treasure,"if it wasnt for back issues of filmfax, i would have missed this old fun interesting book, featuring nice info on many films dear to my heart..it is a shame it is not on the radar for more people...it should be"
1,Why?,"I found a much better producet, on-line, for $25.00 LESS. Guess I would like to know why there is such a hugue mark up on this brand."
3,Not too fresh,"I ordered this product as I am interested in superfoods and organic as well. The product arrived and the berries were not too fresh. Even though they are dried, they should retain good color and flavor and both of these were missing. I tried sprouting them as they should sprout easily if they are fresh, and they didn't sprout easily at all. I would not purchase these again."
4,Its good!!!!!!!,This toy is great for responsible kids. Period. It is a little small for mi head and is weak. By younger brother steped on the ear piece and it broke. other then that it is a good toy.
3,Spy Link,Geuss what kids! There is a new spy toy in town and its called Spy Link. Spy Link lets you hear better on what is going on from far distancis. So go get yours today tomorrow the next day or in 5 years because it is never gonna be out of stock. Or maybe it will. I dont know and you dont know so get yours soon I meen if you want it but if yall dont then dont buy it lol.
2,[weak],"This is the weakest set of walkie talkie we have owned. Like other dissapointed buyers of this set, we have a ton of AM radio interference and we can hear the local honky tonk station, but not each other. ALso lacks range... We can be 15 feet apart even when there is no interference and not hear each other. After buying this I realized that the new personal communication devices for families do not cost much more and work great, most for 2 miles. This one onlly looks cool. The headphone is very hard for my 6 year old to attach and frustrates hoim. It is a tiny headset only big enough for a kid about 6. The only good thing is it looks cool."
2,Picks up local radio station - can't hear over music !,"The hands-free headset walkie talkie seemed like it would be a blast! I couldn't hear my son speak to me over the sound of our local radio station comming in through the ear peice though! I found that I had to be standing and facing a particular position to get rid of the radio sounds, and hear him speak. It was frustrating! I was not happy. The kids will have to make sure they can use this toy where ever they are playing. Or they are useless. They won't be to useful in our home, unless you want to listen in one ear to the Oldies radio station. The idea of this toy is super - If it didn't receive a radio station."
1,another Wild Planet piece of junk,"This is not the first Wild Planet item we purchased that was defective, but it will be the last. One of the earpieces is nonfunctional, and the reception on the other is terrible. Unfortunately, we lost the packaging and cannot return them for a refund.If you purchase anything of the Wild Planet items, be sure to save the packaging and receipt, as you will most likely need to return it."
4,Great Entertainment,"I ordered this item for my Nephew's Birthday. This kid has every toy imagined (lol). He loved this item, as did his brother and sister. They have played together for hours with this communications set. It's entertaining and it teaching children to play together."
2,The price is right,"I agree with another reviewer that the sound quality leaves something to be desired, but for price and nostalgia factor, is worth adding to the collection, even if you only end up using one or two in your holiday mix."
2,Doesn't live up to the title,"I was disappointed in the album. It lists many acclaimed performers and ensembles, but the recordings are old. The sound quality is quite poor, and the arrangements and performing styles are very dated. Particularly annoying are the renditions by Mario Lanza and Sergio Franchi, who seem concerned only with showing off their powerful voices and not at all connected with the message these carols convey. This will go to the bottom of my Christmas CD collection."
3,Sister Christian was my wedding dance song,I THINK NIGHT RANGER IS COOL..SISTER CHRISTIAN WAS OUR WEDDING DANCE SONG..I WOULDGIVE THIS A THUMBS UP TOBUY.......
3,How about a Best of instead?,"Should have been a ""best of"" album.This seems to cover only three albums and a lot of good material isn't here.I think their heavier side isn't really represented here and that radio makes them out to be ballad boys.I do like this album for most of the songs but where's Seven Wishes,This boy needs to Rock and Interstate Love Affair?I know you won't get these on a greatest hits record,but they should be.Get the first three records instead.Buy this cd used to tie you over."
1,this item was destroyed in the mail I GUESS,when i received this item (cd.) night ranger .i waited so long just to get this certain cd.will when i opened the package even as i was pulling the cd. out it was in peices.....but amazon took care of the problem for me in a very good manner...thank you
1,Rocks like soggy toast,"These guys have to be the blueprint for all the hilarious cheesy songs the Southpark guys use on their TV show and in ""Team America"". You can't find much rock n' roll music that is weaker than Nightranger. And to think this is the greatest hits! Horrible, horrible music. Back in the 80's when everyone was listening to this instead of the Replacements it was laughable. 20 years later it's even more laughable and shocking. The ONLY way anyone could enjoy this would be listening in a nostalgiac sense. If you were 12 in 1985."
1,What R U even thinking?,"This is some of the most dog-awful, run-of-the-mill rock n' roll ever made. Some of the worst the 80s has to offer."
3,Not a good Fixx....,"Warning shot....the versions of ""Stand Or Fall"" and ""Red Skies"" are inferior live versions. This collection also does not include any tracks from albums after ""Walkabout.""The ""Ultimate Collection"" has the studio versions from ""Shuttered Room"" and songs from 3 more albums, and is the better buy."
4,What a GREAT collection of tunes...,"I bought this album mostly because of 'Red Skies' and 'Deeper' but I was VERY pleasantly surprised when I heard and then remembered a few of their classic hits as well, such as 'Saved By Zero', 'Sign of Fire', 'Are We Ourselves' and 'Secret Separation'. EVERYTHING that made The Fixx one of the first alternative bands to make the big time are here. Trust me, it has just about everything you could want in the best of The Fixx. Clearly a great CD."
3,Wish I had read the other reviews first...,"Didn't realize there were live tracks. They're great for being live, but I'm not a big fan of live tracks and what I wanted was the album versions. Should be labeled!!"
2,Ho-Hum,"The Fixx had a handful of hit singles in the US during the mid 1980's. A few had the occasional hummable melody, but by and large they were nothing special, and hardly consequential enough to discussed with any seriousness today. Tellingly, The Fixx's US success was not matched in their native England where the band was, for all practical purposes, ignored."
1,A catchy single or two do not a memorable band make,"The Fixx had one or two modestly catchy hit singles and little else. As a result it is no wonder that the band did not last long, and it is dificult to understand why anybody really needs to hear them today."
4,Does it work but not as fast as expected,I have used this for scanning my photos and negatives. Its quite slow in scanning the images but I am very happy with quality of the images. Software comes with this is easy to setup and use.User manual is very simple and anybody can go through it and start scanning....
1,Bad software,"This device worked fine for a while, then stopped working. When I attached it to another computer, it worked, but it won't work on the original computer. This expereince suggests a software problem, but though I have uninstalled and reinstalled the software several times, the scanner still doesn't work. There is no new software to be updated from Canon and the Canon software drivers install in an unusual fashion. I think that Canon may be a good hardware company but a bad software company. If you want a lot of frustration and heart ache, buy this scanner."
4,"Very nice, especially for the price","I had looked at retail stores and online stores for a flatbed scanner and was unable to find one that was reasonably priced and could do a good job with scanning images. My main reason for purchase was for document scanning which doesnt require much.When I found this one on amazon I was pleased. It has good resolution and was very reasonably priced AND I got free shipping.I am very pleased with my purchase. I have scanned documents, pictures and negatives and all look wonderful. I would recommend this scanner to anyone looking."
2,SLOOOOOOOOOOOW lamp warmup!,"Great scanner for the most part but I needed something to occasionally scan a document or image. I am not ""bulk"" scanning in which I think this is more suited. The reason I say this is when you go to do a scan, there is a several min wait for lamp warmup. Doesn't sound long until you are sitting there waiting to get a quick scan out. Once warm, she's good till the next time so doing several scans in a row isn't bad but the first one is a long wait so be aware. Also, the scans are really saturated to me but I'm not an image expert so maybe that's the way it is supposed. Be prepared to wait on onesy twosy scans though."
4,CanoScan 4200F Review,"Nice unit, works well. Software installation is not as easy as it should be, especially if you have previous Canon drivers installed on your system. The scanner works slowly and the light remains on for a period of time after use. No mention of this was made in the manual and for awhile I thought it was a malfunction. The copy feature works nicely.Solange"
4,Not bad for the price,"If you're a professional looking for a high quality scanner, then go and buy a high quality expensive scanner. However, if you're an average home user, that only wants to scan photos every now and then, you can't beat the quality for the price. After going through the reviews on scanners in the $100-$150 range, this one seemed to fit the bill for what I wanted it for."
1,Died one month after the warranty ended,This made beautiful scans but one year of service is hardly acceptable. It wasn't like I was scanning every day either. Started making a horrible noise and a call to technical support made me conclude that I had to just toss it.
3,Product was stellar for a while ....,"The product is easy to use and the scan quality is good. I haven't tried scanning in film yet, but having the feature is a plus. I purchased this scanner a few months ago and used it a few times and was initially very pleased. Then all of the sudden something failed and the scanner would not communicate with my computer and eventually the power failed on the unit. In the interim, I spent a good deal of time, uninstalling & reinstalling the software and driver in an attempt to fix the issue. I went to the Canon website and tried to troubleshoot, without success. When I called Canon, they were very helpful and shipped out a new replacement within two days, along with a prepaid label to return the damaged scanner."
5,great purchase,"I purchased this scanner to digitize my wedding photos for sharing with far-away friends and family. It has been extremely easy to use and has produced great images. And for the price, you really can't go wrong."
4,Patience,less user friendly than my Visioneer.But scan quality is great.Takes a little patience to understand the software.
4,Nice scanner,"This is a nice scanner. I spent quite a few hours scanning photo after photo into my computer, and this scanner scans fast and the photos have a good quality."
2,Would Be Good... If It Worked!,"Pros- scans have pretty good qualityCons- stopped working after several uses and gave several errors. Troubleshooting with Canon did not resolve this issue. The device had to be returned.- did not work with Mac OSX and not supported by Linux SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) project.Comments: overall, a no-bells-and-whistles scanner with limited compatibility. I would be happy to keep it... if it actually worked!"
3,Canon CanoScan 4200F scanner,"Surprised to see there is no ON/OFF Switch. Irritating factor, as there is no wakeup mode (like computer either).If I have to use it for more than a day, then I have to pull the wire out of socket and reconnect again. Hate this product for this.Quality, Ease of use is fine. Flim scanning also worked well. Eventhough there is the latest one, where you do not have to open the lid everytime to insert the flim negatives. Better to buy that, even if is expensive."
1,NOT FOR MAC USERS - NO DRIVER OR SUPPORT FOR OS X!!!,"Don't bother getting this scanner if you plan on running it from an Apple. The Canon tech support people flat-out said they don't provide a Mac driver for this scanner and I found out the hard way.It would have taken no time at all for Canon to provide a simple driver script on the install disc, but instead they've made a product completely useless to a huge number of potential users. Not cool."
1,Macintosh Owners Beware!,I made the mistake of analyzing the reviews of this product so well that I missed the fact that this is not compatible with Macintosh computers. You can find this fact in the fine point of technical data.The Flatbed Scanner should be relabel as a Windows Scanner!
1,Junk,"I was rather unimpressed with the cheap cardboard-like slip cover that you have to remove to scan in 35mm film strips. After 20 scans, the scanner stopped working. I emailed cannon support and after a few emails, they informed me that the scanner was defective. Wonderful. Next time, I'm getting an Epson."
3,Kids times watch,"The elastic part that holds the watch head was all stretched out & ready to brake apart after only 3 weeks of my 7 year old son wearing it! (Mind you he wore it day & night!) I complained to amazon and they sent us a new timex watch - no problem. So far, so good!"
1,the elastic band broke in less than a week,"My son received his watch for his birthday. Loved the watch - he went swimming with it, showered with it. Than in 5 days, the bank tore by the pin. I have to send it to timex, which told me that the watch will not be the exact watch I get back. Could be a different color and all. And on top of that I have to pay for the shipping and handling both ways. I will get a different band on his next watch."
1,Poorly Made,"I purchased this for my 7 year old son. He wore his previous watch everyday for 21/2 years before he cracked screen. The elastic piece that is sewn into the band has pulled out rendering the watch unwearable. I purchased it Aug 13th but did not need to give it to him (I was saving it for Christmas, but gave it to him after his watch face cracked) until a week ago. He wore it for 4 days before it fell apart - and now I'm passed the return date. Rotten deal - VERY DISSAPPOINTED."
2,Low Quality Materials,"This watch is almost perfect, but there is a major design flaw. The actual time piece is attached to the wrist band with an elastic strap. My son (who is not typically hard on things) has had this watch for a week exactly and the elastic piece is already falling apart."
2,"Great watch, poorly designed band","My nine year old son saved up to buy this watch. He was very proud and wore it every day. However, the watch is attached to it's velcro band by a piece of elastic that lost it's elasticity within 2 weeks. Now the watch just kind of flops around on the band. It no longer looks cool or sturdy. Would not recommend!"
2,Kids watch,"I bought this watch for my 5 year-old boy. It's ok. However, the strap torn three weeks after he got the watch. Besides, it was very difficult for him to secure it in his wrist, due to the buckle got loose frequently. Nice looking watch. That's all."
1,defective strap,"Unusual design, with the body of the watch attached to the main wrist strap via a secondary short strap. The attachment zones of the 2 straps are defective, as they tore at one end within 2 weeks of receipt...twice. after the first incident, I sent in the watch...I promptly received a replacement, which promptly broke in the same fashion 2 weeks later. Our child insists he did not mishandle the watches. This is a watch NOT to buy.Note: The attachments described above are not obvious based on the provided photograph. The black stripe bordering the upper edge of the white patch bearing the word ""TIMEX"" on it (see Amazon photo) is one of the two short straps, the other is on the opposite side of the watch face."
5,Perfect for small-wristed adults too!,"My daughter is 19 and looking for a durable watch for college. We had a terrible time finding one for her small wrists (6"") but this one fits great. Plus it's unisex-looking enough and not too ""kid"" looking that it keeps her dignity intact as well. Great no-frills watch for a student on the go!"
3,"good watch, not very strong though","My kid broke the band in about a week, no replacements online. Watch is useless without the band. Why did it break so easily anyway? Otherwise its a decent watch for a kid."
4,Timex Ironkids watch,"Great watch for kids, just enough bells and whistles...strap isn't good for older kids (13 and up) as it is on the small side."
3,Very cute watch; but buttons defective (might be a fluke),"The watch was quite appealing to my 10-year-old grandson, however the ""stopwatch"" function was defective and would not respond to button pushing. Could just have been a fluke as otherwise it was great. Although it was disappointing, Amazon's response and immediate credit was not. Great job, [...]."
1,Timex kids watch,"This is the 3rd watch I have purchased, and the other two were great. This one says it is waterproof to 50 ft, but after 1 day in a pool, the face clouded up and the watch stopped working. I would not purchase this watch again, nor would I recommend it."
1,"Can not ""take a licken & keep on ticken'""","My 9 year-old son got this watch for Christmas and within two weeks the elastic that hold the face is almost completely shredded! What happened to the Timex watches that could ""take a licken!"" This watch fell apart after barely being used!"
1,bad warranty policy,"I bought a kid's Timex watch for my son. It broke after 7 month of use (even though the kid is very neat). To get it fixed or replaced, you have to mail the watch and also include $8 return postage fee. Is it worth the effort? I will never buy Timex again."
4,Great watch for kids,We bought this for our 8 year old boy. He loves it. It is easy and comfortable to wear and so far seems very durable.
3,Timex Kids could be more kid friendly,"Ordered this for my son, who asked for a digital watch for Christmas. He won't wear it because the digital numbers are too small for him to read. Kids' watches should have big, clear numbers that are easy for kids to read. Disappointing!"
4,So far so good...,So far my 7 year-old son likes it. It is still just a touch big for his little arm. We have not had the watch long enough to make a comment either way on its durability.
2,Not Durable,"My boy received Timex Ironkids watch as a Christmas present last year. He liked it very much but the watch plastic part was broken in 7 months. So I ordered a replacement from Amazon. Several months later, the watch freezes up. I checked it and found three out of four buttons don't bounce back after pressing them.My boy does like the design of this watch but two watches were broken in ten months. So don't expect it can last very long if you decide to buy this watch."
2,disapointed,"I was very pleased with this watch when it arrived. But, there have been several flaws occurring within 3 weeks. Firstly, the elastic in the strap is coming out. Secondly, the indiglo nightlight has failed and lastly the strap is not easy to adjust. I chose this model very carefully - from the many models available. I am very dissapointed in it.It is a good watch, but not up to the wear and tear of an ordinary 11 year old boy."
2,Poor quality,I have actaully had two so far. First one just froze about 8 days after my son received it. Amazon was excellent and replaced it. But now after about 4 weeks the elastic part of the band is all stretched out of space. Seems to be a real low build qaulity on this watch.
3,Good and bad...,"My 11 year old son got this for Christmas. He loves the all the different operational features and can easily operate the watch himself. Three negatives....1. The watch itself is really big and bulky. I can't imagine it on a younger kids' wrist. 2. 6 months later the elastic band that holds the watch to the watchband is all stretched out and looks ready to break any moment. and 3. All the color has scraped off the front of the watch though, to be fair, it's been worn every day for 6 months and probably gets banged around a lot. From my viewpoint, if they could streamline the size of this watch a bit and improve the band it would be 5 star all the way."
3,Moderately happy,"I ordered this watch for my 8 yr old son who needed an alarm to help him get home from playing on time! It's a nice design and the mechanics works well, but the strap isn't high quality. There is an elastic strap that holds the watch face on and after wearing for a week, it was loose and the watch face moved around."
4,My son's new watch,"My 6 year old loves the watch. He wears it all the time. The features, which include a chronometer and a timer are great. The only problem is the they are hard to set. The buttons are difficult to push (although, my son manages to push litght button all the time). Nevertheless, the watch works as a great reinforcer for learning to tell time and the timer has helped greatly in situations where he has to wait. It was worth the money."
1,watch leaked when my son went swimming,"I bought the watch in May as a gift for my son and when the weather warmed up in late June (after the 30 day return period), the watch leaked! I would not by a product like this from Amazon again, because it cannot be returned within a reasonable timeframe.[[ASIN:B000B4ZXXY Timex Kids' T71962 IronKids Digital Fast Wrap Blue Watch."
4,Good watch,"I really wanted a good watch, which it is, but I didn't bought thinking it was a toy.Overall, it's been working great and has good features. Its gray finishing scratches easily but mostly due to its careless user my son, besides that, it works great."
4,"easy to use, indestructable","My 9 year old boy likes the way it looks. This watch is easy for him to put on and take off by himself. The moving sports graphic at the top of the display can be minorly distracting. It has survived the boy hazards of mud, swimming pool, bike accidents, insect repellent, etc. without a scratch. I have hand washed the band a few times."
1,Great looking but NOT functional,"We purchased this watch for my son's 9th birthday. Although other reviewers have had mechanical problems...ours was just that the band stretched out and finally broke after only 3 months of wear. Very poor design, don't waste your money. Go for a rubber/plastic band for active boys. We replaced this with the Kids' Timex 1440 Sports Watch - Black Band/red accents purchased right here on Amazon through Target...14.99 plus 5.99 to ship."
2,Band is terrible....,"I bought this watch for my son's birthday 2 months ago. The watch has been fine, but the velcro band shredded at the pressure point and is now useless. Thank you to amazon.com for the refund..."
2,Kind of disappointed,"Got this for my granddaughter this past Christmas. For some unknown reason, the works of the watch, the heavy part, is attached with elastic. The elastic serves no function. After about a month the works were dangling a good inch from the watchband because the elastic had given out. I stitched it tight again and about 2 wks. later one of the watchband pins popped out and got lost. The reason I'm so disappointed is she begged for this watch. I figured it would be as good as the camo one I gave her brother a year ago. He wears it everyday and loves it. Just gotta remember the thing only cost $20... it's not a Rolex."
2,This is barely a watch,"This item seemed to be the only kid's ""watch"" on amazon without a silly graphic and that is the main reason my daughter chose it for her wishlist. It was packaged like a watch, has features that a watch should have and is worn on the wrist, but besides those similarities to your favorite watch, it fails everywhere else. The pictures do show different angles, but those may be shopped because this thing is way too bulky for a child to wear on the wrist. Also, the elastic band that holds the watch piece is loose and the watch piece slides around. The only size comparison I can think of is a heart rate monitor or pedometer. More importantly, the watch she received failed at keeping time; lost 5+ minutes in 24 hours. We returned it and selected the unisex/women's 1440 model instead."
4,Good kids watch,"Well, the first one did not last long for my son, the time froze. But my daughter has had hers for a long time so I still think this is the best kids watch out there for the price given that they could be easily lost and get hard use. I re-ordered for my son and will keep my fingers crossed."
4,Timex Kids' IronKids Digital Blue Fast Wrap Velcro Strap Watch,I bought this watch for my grandson and he loves it. Loves how easy it is to strap on each morning!.
5,Nice watch for a teenage boy,"Nice watch, lots of features, teenage son loves it. Easy to set, easy to read. Good value for the price."
5,The product was perfect .,"this product isperfect for childs, I love it because is easy for my daughters reading the time,they are happiness with the product"
1,dell,I haven't tried this item but if this particular product is anything like my dell inspiron 9300 then DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO NOT GET RIPPED OFF. they do not stand behind their product they don't care once you purchase their lemons. So save your money for something that will actually work as advertised because the only thing dell computers do is take up space
2,Not very effective,"I have the fluval 2 in a 20 gallon tank, with a small oscar and a few corys. I have the charcoal pad along with the two course pads. It works good for moving the water around, but the way the filter holes are situated it hardly filters at all. the intakes are close to the bottom, on the sides, as the picture shows. But the holes leading to the filter media, they are in a separate compartment inside, are at the top if the filter, near where the power head pulls in the water.So basicly instead of having the power head at the top, draw water through layers of filter media, it barely goes through any filter media at all. just poorly designed in my opinion."
2,Does not work,This filter did not work at all. My tank is 20 gallon but only filled about 3-4 inches and the water was constantly mucky with turtle waste. Dont waste your money on this filter!
1,Misleading advertising for GOOSE DOWN Pillows,"Not what I was expecting, there just basic feather pillows, not goose down, not soft at all. Dont waste your money. If it looks too good to be true, it probably is. I was hoping to replace my current old goose down I got on domestications for cheaper price, now in the long run its costing me double. I could have got pillows like these at TJ MAXX for much less. Total disappointment, theyre ok pillows but i could have got these same pillows at walmart or Tj maxx for much less. they are noisy and crunchy. I was expecting soft down pillows that your head sinks in to quietly."
3,Too little feather to each pillow...,These pillows are what you get for your money... They don't have enough feathers in them :( A little disappointing.
3,okay,"these were my first ""down"" pillows.. i got medium support and if you fluff them up before you lie down you sink right into them which is what i wanted but you do have to re fluff them. i must warn you that it IS a feather pillow and eventually feathers will pop out but i have to give these credit since i had them for over six months before i saw the first tiny feather come out, and it did not poke me cause it was so little and soft. that to me is a big step from my old calvin klein pillows which is what i previously had, those lasted about 2 months before i started seeing 3-4 feathers a night!! not to mention calvin klein apparently uses really huge and really poky feathers cause they made scratches on my face, but anyway the review is for these down pillows not for ck's so i have to say at 29.99 for 2 pillows its alright, anything above that price and you will probably feel ripped off."
2,Standard Down feather Pillows,"The pillows are not to bad, but it took a bit longer to receive them for the price that I paid. I would recommends these to others...."
1,Nasty pillows,"I wish I had read the customer reviews before I spent my money. These are good only for making a bed look like it has heaps of pillows on it. The pillows are hard, lumpy straight out of the box, low quality in every way -- even lower quality than I expected from the too-brief description. I have used down-&-feather pillows before and liked them, but these are just too much. Impossible!"
2,you get what you pay for.,"The price was good, so that's why I bought the pillows. You get what you pay for with these. They are not as fluffy as you may think they should be. One of my pillows even had a stain in the corner. Maybe ink. So I'm guessing it was returned as well and it was not properly checked before being shipped out again. Next time I'm just going to pay a little more for a pillow and shop for it at a store and not online."
4,Best Night Sleep,I have never slept better. These are the best pillows ever. I highly recommend them.
2,Worst Pillows I've Ever Had,"pros: they are pillows and can be used as such, uncomfortablycons: noticeable smell, still, after 6 months; they protrude sharp needle points into your head and neck; too big for my liking, loud noise when you move your head.bottom line: search elsewhere, these are horrible."
2,FLAT Pillows,"I purchased four of these pillows! I really shouldn't have wasted my money. They fluff up as soon as you take them out of the bags but after you sleep on them they are flat and impossible to fluff up, i'd rather sleep without a pillow at all!!!"
2,Description needs improvement,"I read the description, but missed the very small percentage actual down. Was expecting a lot more down. But I have tried them for a couple of months, and give them a B grade overall.. The feathers are noticably felt, prickly, but you can move a tad and it gets better. I prefer much softer pillows, but these will do until they are worn out. Down pillows only last a few years in Houston's very humid weather... Yeah,,, they eventually get smelly..."
2,Pillows not as pictured,"These pillows look so fluffy in the picture but are flat as pancakes.Sounded like a great deal, was too good to be true"
2,pillows weren't fluffy enough,Some said that the pillows weren't fluffy enough. I hate to admit it but I have to agree. They seem great at first but the don't really stand up great on their own. I have them propped up against my wall at the head of my bed and I have to really fluff them just so for them to look right. They need to be filled a little more.
1,inaccurate advertising,"The cover fabric is not 100% cotton, it is 100% polyester. It is totally useless to me. I pay money for feathers because I have to avoid polyester."
4,comfort sleep !!!!,"The Queen Classic Down Pillowsare great . I am pleased with the quality .They are very comfortable , hold their shape,no feather pokes.Im pleased with my purchase ... and the price was great !!!"
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"These pillows are horrible. Do not waste your money. The cover is hard and scratchy. Within five seconds of laying on them, they are flat and completely worthless. If you want to toss them into a decorative sham and never use them....that is all they are good for."
1,Shouldn't be advertised as a down pillow,"This product does not compare to a true down pillow, since it is only 5% down. Anyone who has slept on a true down pillow will be VERY disappointed, as was I."
4,Hilarious and disturbing,"Red Meat is probably one of the funniest damn comic strips in recent memory. This book shows a great range of the series, from the macabre (""Don't get too close to the killer whales!"" ""AUGH! MY ARM!"" ""..Yeah, ya got too close."") to the sadistic Milkman Dan and his little girl protege (""I hate you, Milkman Dan."")Many stories excuse their simplistic drawings with the saying that the intelligent dialogue makes it OK. Most of the time they're just excusing their own laziness. But in this strip, with the same drawings often used for every panel, it really is the dialogue that makes you laugh until you cry.I highly recommend this book. My only quibble is that it isn't longer!"

4,what we eat,"Beef 4 is a ""best of"" compilation of the Beef TV series that ran for six episodes on BET. So far, this has gotten bad reviews, but its nowhere near as bad as Beef 3. There are some pretty terrible sections in this (queen of the south, Pall Wall etc), but those are outweighed by awesome, historic feuds that all hip-hop fans should know:Daz vs. KuruptJay-Z vs. Damon DashLL Cool J vs. Jaime FoxxThe Game vs. Ras KassAnd then there's some lesser known ones that are still pretty good [Terry Kennedy vs. Lupe Fiasco, Nickz vs. ENJ]. Probably the best (or worst) one is the Jay-Z/Dash story. That tale of Jay-Z tearing apart Roc-A-Fella records is a really sad sight to see. Anyways, if you're a fan of the other DVDs in the series, this one's a must."
1,Beef IV the worst of the worst.,"Beef 1 is the best one of the 4,the only reason worth watching is Pac',all the rest is just post-1996(Rap Game is Dead)malarkey,Biggie,G a y -Z, flab boy,mobb sleep are all whack, East Coast Rap unless it's 80s or BDI and Bootcamp Clik/SmiffnWessum it doesn't matter, And all these so-called ""Positive Rappers"" as Willie D once said Positivity ain't getting nobody paid. All these back-packers read Fake muslims(Nation of Islam is a Radical Communist Sect-yet they have an monopoly on bean pies and providing security for the industry,ironically the suspect last seen around BIG was an Bowtie wearing ""Peaceful"" follower.)

1,DOA - never functions,My unit was DOA and never functioned so no review of performance. I have purchased FR products from Amazon before and was generally satisfied. This one was not.
3,Works okay but better for parent to do it for small child,"My son got this for Christmas and even though it comes with extra ""rockets"" the one that comes actually on the launcher works the best (the hole is too small on the extras it needs to be worked with to stretch out). He liked playing with it but he does have a hard time getting it up high. Kids can't get their arms working to compress it fast enough but an adult can work it fine. Be careful with the hands because you can pinch your hand on the plastic when you quickly compress the tube inside the outer tube."
4,Classic christmas album,I've been listening to this album on record since I was a little girl so I was very happy when it was released on CD. Has a great mix of originals and traditional Christmas songs. Kenny Rogers' voice and the songs make you want to curl up next to the fire! A must-have for anyone who likes tradition christmas music!
5,Excellent,"This CD was excellent, just what I was looking for in a particular song and all the songs are excellent. So glad I found it."
5,Outstanding Mozart,The Franz Schubert Quartett have just the right sound for Mozart's quartets. They are comparable to the Alban Berg Quartet Teldec set and the Talich Quartet in interpretation and perhaps just a bit sweeter. Their 3 discs of the late quartets are outstanding and second to none. Highest recommendation. Check out their version of the Tchaikovsky Quartets as well.
5,Good source matarial for class,I used this book in my Management in Society class in college. The assignment was to write a paper about an issue that did not exist 10 years ago. Identity theft seems like an interesting subject since it is a topic that every person should be concerned about in the United States. I even did an individual presentation off of the information in this book. I think the simplistic way the book is laid out is a strength of this book. I was able to find good information in a short period of time because of how well the book was organized. I would recommend this book to anyone who might have the need to do the same type of research or anyone who wants to protect oneself from the crime of identity theft.
1,Ridiculous size for the price,"The color is beautiful and the shape is nice, but if you want more than 1 tablespoon of creme brulee at a time, don't bother with these dishes. They are too small to be worthwhile. However, if you wanted to give each guest 1 small truffle...they fit perfectly. We'll be sending them back."
1,This product is not helpful,"Amazon's price is good compared to other vendors, but this product is no help to me at all. My friend living in the same hotel room said I snore as usual. This product insert only half an inch into the nose, while most nasal congestion is deep inside nasal passage. I just can't figure out how this could work. Anyway, The manufacture should really seriously consider all the responses and improve the product. Don't cheat customers again and again."
2,Not effective for me,"It may be due to its one size fits all issue, but this device pinched my nose and did not provide snoring relief according to my partner. I think it is rather expensive for what it is (or isn't). I was disappointed. Might work better for smaller noses?"
1,Horrible research and poorly formulated arguments,"As other reviewer have mentioned, Levenda contradicts his own conclusions and arguments in this book; arguments formed by poor research and untrustworthy sources.It's at least as bad as ""Spear of Destiny"" if not worse, due to the greater amount of verifiable, solid sources available."
4,Suprising,"A tale of the creation, heyday and survival of the Nazi party. The book takes you through alot of twists and turns, some quite shocking, and all quite true! Interesting and hard to believe, but a reality of the past and the present."
5,Legend,"I have had a problem 4 quite a while now...WHY DO PEOPLE RESPECT DADDY YANKEE MORE THEN VICO-C sorry daddy yankee..but yu have absolutely no talent please dont take credit 4 gasolina cuz the lyrics in it suck and the only thing good about it is the beat..and the only reason gurls like him is cuz hes ""sexy""...but we all know yu didnt make the beat and you all know that he wears alot ov makeup. vico-c is a legend in latin hip hop and reggaeton and all yu daddy yankee fans out there diss me all you want you all know im saying the truth."
3,Tasty instrumental jams,"I have never heard of Cosmosquad or Jeff Kollman until now. Jeff is a tasty guitarist with chops and talent, and from a visit to his website, he is a very busy musician. ""Acid Test"" is Cosmosquad's fourth album (9 songs, 52 minutes long) and Jeff has several other projects going on at the same time. On this disc, it is Jeff and Shane Gaalaas (also a busy musician with several solo albums) who plays drums, co-produced, recorded, mixed, and helped master the album. Guest musicians fill in playing bass and keys on a few songs. The music is instrumental rock and/or fusion that reminds me a bit ofAmino Acid FlashbackorGet Out of My Yard. Definitely work checking out if you like guitar-heavy jams, and you can get this at a decent price if you check out Jeff's website."
4,Great product,"Excellent design, a bit pricey and reception is not the greatest for weak stations i.e. fm. Overall well built, attractive overall great product."
5,A fabulous find,"This book was an accidental find for me, but I am really glad I came across it. It is a fabulous story focusing on a courtroom drama, but it contains many elements that kept me riveted right to the last moment. Troubled hero, unloved heroine, father-daughter relationship that has gone awry, a woman trying to make her way in a man's world...as well as a beautiful romance and suspenseful thriller...what more could you want?! My only complaint was I felt the ending was rushed and the relationship between Alice and her father was not properly dealt with, in my opinion. I also was sad that Lee did not pay enough attention to the relationship between the Lucas' parents - it had been explored so well in ""Swan's Way"" and I was disappointed in the lack of details Lee gave us about how they got back together again. Having said that, it kept me enthralled - highly recommended."
3,"Great book but left me with a lot of ""Huhs?""","Having read SWAN'S GRACE, I was a little leary of reading this book but did so at the constant urging of a good reading buddy. I really enjoyed this book and found it much better than its predecessor. Lucas and Alice are both wonderful, but I still had a lot of questions at the end that I won't go into since people reading this review may not have read the book yet. The story grabs you and keeps you interested, I just wondered if everything was ""wrapped up"" as it could/should have been. Overall, a very good book."
3,Metal Gear Solid doesn't suit the handheld,"It was too hard to control Snake and his compatriots in this game. The mission structure was nothing like the console iterations of Metal Gear, as levels were self-contained and not free flowing. However, i do realize this is an important plot point later on in Big Boss' life leading to the eventual creation of Outer Heaven. The graphics and animation were excellent however for the portable, but the gameplay is restrictive and frankly boring.But, if you're an avid MGS fan, you must own this game, as it is part of the canon storyline."
4,Big Fan,"Plays great. Love the art and the story so far. Haven't beaten it, taking my time-- But enjoying every minute."
2,Just okay,After reading a few other Culture series books by Banks I found this one to be a bit tedious and the characters poorly developed. I enjoyed The Player of Games and a couple of other books by him so will try at least one more. I do appreciate that he develops a new plot line and new characters in each book rather than relying on repeat characters. This technique reminds me of Kage Baker's Company series which I think has a more fully developed story and characters.
2,Pointless,"As I read this book, I found myself fascinated with the universe the author created. The settings were incredible and imaginative, as were the aliens and technology. However, towards the end, as the story stretches aimlessly on and on from locale to locale you start wondering what the point of the story is and the answer is there really is none. In addition, the character development was pretty poor, I didn't really care about any of them. I ended up feeling annoyed with the entire story by the time I reached the end of the book. I wouldn't recommend this book."
3,I prefer the later Culture novels.,"I am reading this after starting with the later Culture novels. It is ok but I don't really dig te characters, especially the main protagonist.Worth a read for the background but not the greatest Culture novel."
3,"Cool, but not the best Culture book","This was my introduction to Iain M Banks and The Culture. This wasn't my favorite book in this series, but worth a read nonetheless."
5,Great read!,"Kept me coming back for more, with great character development, and an ever interesting societal backdrop which made me come back for more of the Culture."
5,"An epic introduction to the ""Culture""","Out of his first three Culture novels, ""Consider Phlebas"" is the most sweeping and adventurous epic. It takes you to incredible worlds, you'll meet a great cast of characters, and there is plenty of action, romance, gore, escapism, humor, and technological overload to keep you reading non-stop. The end left me genuinely emotional, but fear not, this was only an introduction."
4,"Great from beginning to end, almost.","This book is a great space opera. Loads of actions, plot twists, and character shake-ups. I enjoyed reading it to the very end. It's in the end that the book, to me, disappoints the reader, us. The ending is so anti-climatic. The book steered me into a certain direction that I was guessing, anticipating a great, possibly fantastic ending; instead I was left with a ""WTF"" frame of mind. Did Mr Banks have a due date on this that he ended it the way he did? I know that this was his first forray into SF, but still, I hope his next book that I intend to read, and yes I will read the next one, will pay off where this book didn't. Good read but the end was away from the story."
5,"unsettling, hilarious, dark, thrilling, etc.","This book is excellent. I read it in about a week, and I never wanted to put it down. It's fast-paced, it's thrilling, and it has an excellent sense of (dark) humor. Banks does an excellent job of making you love (or hate) the characters in the book. Intelligent, a bit dark, and a lot of fun, this book is one of my favorites."
4,Clever and ironic book..,"Iain M. Banks is one of the few authors who regularly produces both literary and generic works. This novel, ""Consider Phlebas,"" was his first sci-fi novel. It combines the galactic scope of Asimov's 'Foundation' series with the pace and suspense of a thriller. Both the Culture and the Idirans are searching for Mind, an intelligence hidden on the Planet of the Dead, but it is Horza the Changer's quest to find it first. Presented with historical appendices, Banks's narration is clever, ironic, and unsettling."
5,TheBest Book,"I loved this book, from the great discription of the action to the the deeper meaning, it was well written (to say the least). The end really stayed with me and so did almost all of the rest, if you like Banks (or if you don't) read this book. I've never found a book that touched this one, Thank you Iain Banks"
4,A solid read but an undiciplined story line.,"I like the broad stroke view of galactic history, somewhat like asimov, brin or vinge. But this is an earlier work and there are characters woven into the story who deserve more development."
1,awful,"This was awful. What bugs me the most is that the protagonist, Horza, never seems to have any thoughts that the author considers worth relating to the reader. Horza participates in the massacre of a whole temple full of monks, a situation in which he doesn't have a lot of choices, but which he nevertheless makes absolutely no effort to avoid. How does that make him feel? We never find out.The silly space opera physics was also a little over the top for me. I couldn't tell if it was meant as a joke or not."
2,Not good,"This book was a fairly large disappointment. It's overly long, the plot rambles, there is no character development--the author seems to kill off most of the people in the book in a rather haphazard fashion--and when I finished the book I just didn't understand what had been accomplished in the book. There were a couple of imaginative scenes, but overall this book was pretty boring."
3,A Brilliant Imagination Going to Waste,"It's a shame that Ian M. Banks has no rational philosophy to guide his obvious talent. His skill and imagination as a writer are first-rate. But his superlative skills are wasted in the service of a morally ambiguous story of an anti-heroic character involved in a pointless war between inexplicable civilizations that seem equally good or equally bad and equally opaque in their motives.After slogging my way through this lengthy, powerfully-written, visually stunning, epic-scale space opera--hoping with each page to become more engrossed in the story--I found in the end that I simply couldn't care. Not about the characters. Not about the outcome. Not about anything.I suppose Banks has bought into the tired post-modern idea that moral ambiguity makes his work serious and sophisticated. But in fact, it just makes all the beautiful writing boring and pointless."
3,"Interesting, but I've expected more of it","Did I like this book? Yes, but I've expected to be more exciting. I think this is not a so easy reading, which is good, but sometimes I found it really tiresome in its structure, which is bad. This ""Culture"" concept is very interesting anyway, and I plan to read the other books."
2,Deus ex Machina . . . Culture Style . . .,"First, I would like to point out that Banks is my favorite author.I think one of the least enjoyable experiences I have had in reading is when the author resorts to his power to alter the course of events so the good guys can win when normally they would have lost.Banks does this. I was really disappointed. Everything else of his was great, but he literally pulled the cavalry out of his head. I kept thinking toward the end that it was absolutely hopeless for the protagonists.I'm used to getting a good laugh or being handed a well-shrouded bit of philosophy, but I also found that lacking here. Some of the characters are cardboard cut-outs as well.However, he's trying to present an arguement for the Culture here, in a style somewhat similar to the French Romanticists of two centuries ago."
2,Like a train crash on the London Underground,"Be warned! Although this story has potential, it never really lives up to it. I bought it because of all the hype surrounding Iain Bank's novels, but mostly for its cover (at least in the British edition) - an enormous ringworld-like arc floating in space and dwarfing a starship. However, instead of an epic story, after the promising initial premise (two VERY different cultures at war and struggling to beat each other in retrieving a highly advanced ""probe"" lost on a remote planet) what you get are several different scenarios, none of which actually has any relevance to the next one. It's like a patchwork of your all time favorite action movie sequences: the sinking of the Titanic, Robinson Crusoe and the cannibals, and some enormous train crash desaster on the Underground. In the end, this is light entertainment, but does not create any characters or storyline you really care about."
3,Enjoyable but...,"The book's scope is enjoyable. There are many wonderful sets. Everything is impossibly large only to be dwarfed by something more impossibly large, old or powerful.The story is a tumble through the locations. On tight spot after another, after another. In that sense it is a page turner. But, I found it to be an empty read. Characters generally get killed off the instant they begin to show some personality.In the end it is the written world equivalent of a special effects driven Hollywood summer movie. Lots of cool concepts that I'm the end signify nothing."
4,good but not great,I liked the book. It was a fun adventure through space and alien planets. I liked the mature narrative. Would recommend.
4,First banks book I read,"This book for me started a slight obsession with the authors work. I really think his culture work is his best and since this was the book that got me into it all I feel there's a slight bias towards it, some of the reviews about it being a bit of a slog here and there are quite right. But I feel that way about parts of Lord of the Rings, Dune, Stranger in a Strange land etc. Sometimes I forget that occasionally a story isn't going to go all the way I want it to or that the character I want to know more about right now isn't going to be the focus of attention and that's when I can end up putting a book down for a while and maybe never coming back to it. Fortunately for me with Consider Phlebas I came back and boy am I glad I did!"
1,Wow..,"Usually when I find a book to be ""bad"" I sort of figure it out in the first chapter or so, and while I admit I put this book down a few times it finally drew me in.. but when the book started dropping plot-lines, and then when it finally got to the ""end"", I was so freaking upset I literally trashed the book... I mean, I would be embarrassed to suggest this book for anyone else to read.I LOVE reading, but the very fact that this book ends with nothing having happened in the entire story-line makes me feel like my mind was taken advantage of, my time wasted and I feel dumber for just having read it. If I could rate a book lower than one stars, well, I would do so.I have read a few other books in the culture since then, at the pressure of some friends, and it is like they are written by different authors.How did this book get published?"
1,I rarely get angry at a book...but...,"Don't get me wrong. This book has some great concept stuff in it. There are also a couple of great action scenes.But seriously. What the heck is the point of this book? It goes nowhere, it has no point, and every bit of emotional investment the reader puts into the characters and story is dashed to pieces by the end of the book.I have read hundreds and hundreds of books over the years. This is the first one I physically threw against a wall and was annoyed at myself for finishing.I strongly recommend reading *anything* except this book."
2,A cold and cruel story,"I found this story difficult to enjoy, but continued to the end out of determination. The characters do not inspire sympathy or empathy, and by the end I just did not care what happened to them. However, if you like neat ideas, this book has lots to admire, with the exploration of the circular world being the best. Some of them, like the emotionally fuelled game, could be expanded (does he bring this into any of the other 'Culture' stories?), but some parts of the story seemed incongruous with the rest of the plot (the cannibals were unnecessary and distracting). As the first book that I have read by Mr Banks I was very disappointed, I recommend 'Feersum Enjin' for a better display of his talents."
2,Lots of side quests not enough story,"I was very interested in reading a Culture novel given how highly regarded the series is among various people that i know. I choose this one mostly due to is being available for my kindle through my local library.Although i feel the writing is good and aspects of the story very interesting, i just can't recommend anyone bother with reading it. The story starts off great with an intriguing plot and characters. It quickly develops a plausible and interesting universe in which to explore. It then go straight to hell with a variety of side stories which are more of a distraction than anything else. It fails in the way some blockbuster movies fail with having tons of actions and little plot. The reader has to trudge through a variety of side quests that feel more like work than adventure.I guess the book was interesting at times but i feel that i might have only finished it because i knew i had to give it back to the library after 21 days."
3,So-So....,"This is a so-so book. Gritty, realistic, and totally bleak. Depressed the heck out of me. But then that is what Mr. Banks is good at, isn't he? Is there a book written by him with a happy ending?I think I am gonna have to go and read the Use of Weapons again (read this more than a decade ago...so I don't remember much expect the name of the protagonist) which from all the reviews seem to be a much superior (but depressing) book than this one."
2,Flawed sience fiction,"I'm dissapointed...I relied on the positive reviews here on amazon for my first SF novel, but instead of a thought provoking tale I got mundane social struggles in a Sci-Fi setting. This book is about war, the people that fight it and their motivations.In the end the story was quite standard with romance and a lots of action (tiresomely so), few twists and even though the ending was unconventional, it was expected long before getting there.Overall I'm unimpressed and I'm hoping ""Player of games"" (which I got with this one) is a lot better.- Update: ""Player of Games"" delivers!"
2,Not that great,"This book is all over the place, and unnecessarily long. It's like each chapter tries to stand on its own with no connection to the story overall. I felt like I was reading a bad Hollywood script that had to have a bunch of unncessary action to justify the length or budget of the thing. Dialog is boring (a very common problem with science fiction writers), and the ending a giant anti-climatic let-down.The only SF writers I have read (so far) that do not suffer from these problems are Arthur C. Clark and Alastair Reynolds (his first books anyway), but I've read all their books and keep hunting for someone to take the next spot as my favorite.This was my first Iain Banks book and probably the last. I only give authors one chance to impress. Maybe Iain's other books are better but it's too late. Sorry."
2,"Read ""The Wasp Factory"" instead","The first book I read by Banks was The Wasp Factory (non-SF), which is an awesome book. This is now the third book I've read of his (and the first sci-fi), and probably the last. I'm a long-time sci-fi fan, but this book feels empty. It has a few cool concepts, a *great* prologue, a strong first chapter, and then... it just felt like a waste of my time. If you're reading this book and have gotten to the part where Horza gets picked up by ""space pirates"" and joins them, or have gotten as far as the attack of the Monk's fortress, and are wondering ""what's up with this cheesy interlude? when will this book get good again?"" stop now. It doesn't. It's mostly pointless action to the very end. Sure, it's ""morally ambiguous,"" but it's mostly just a mixture of gratuitous and boring.Anyways, whether you enjoyed or hated this book, or are contemplating reading it, just read The Wasp Factory. It's dark and brilliant."
1,Very Disappointing,"I know we all have our own tastes, but I really can't understand all the glowing reviews. Did we read the same book?Nothing happens in this book. And while I can appreciate a ""slice of the story"" tale, this book isn't that. Aside from being told how important the missing Mind is, we're never really told why it's important, and it's retrieval is tedious and boring.I won't rehash all the other low-star reviews, just do yourself a favor and skip this book. I personally can't get enough of Peter F. Hamilton, but there are many more exciting reads out there."
2,"It's 100% Larry Niven. A Ringworld imitation. Down to three-legged aliens, protectors, ringworlds, names, hairy females etc","The book is like a draft of a novel, with interesting characters and ideas sketched then forgotten and the action advancing heuristically, like a delirium in which the author only doubles back on his tracks to link events and make some sense now and then. The setting is nothing original, just a remix of Larry Niven's Ringworld... come to think of it there are echoes of other Larry Niven books, such as Beowulf's Children - the hyperoxygenated reserve blood, for bursts of movement. All in all it's a tease, but not a pleasant one. I cursed when I finished reading."
3,Not one of the best around,Cardboard cut out charachters and cleaver ways to dehumanize sentients is all very well and good but its not enough.
2,disappointing,seems like it had elements of being good but just could not manage it. was disappointed by the end.
1,Waste of time - don't bother,"I read the first 30 or so pages on my Kindle for free and enjoyed the story. Thinking the story would expand a bit on the Space Opera bit and also provide some character depth, I bought the book. Mistake. No character depth. I didn't care about any of the characters. The author's descriptions of settings and action sequences leaves much to be desired. I ended up caring for the antagonist more than any other character and I think that was only out of boredom. There is a relationship that develops between two characters which is not compelling or interesting in the least.It seems as though the author was trying to define a future human culture, but make it alien. Which would be great and a lot of authors are able to pull that off, but not in this case. There was no relation back to contemporary human society.I only finished this book hoping I had not made a mistake in the purchase and Mr. Banks would avail himself in the end. I was wrong.I do not recommend this book."
3,mixed feelings but interested,"The book starts interestingly, and has a very detailed world built around the story. It has several sections that have nothing to do with the story, so I believe that the author added in a few short stories to pad out the pages.The Culture Wars is interesting, but I'm not sure if I want to continue reading about them. I may pick up the second book and see if that is a tighter story.It was annoying to have a story that is heading in one direction detour and have pages and pages of detail about something else."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Shapeshifter sides with sentients over silicon.A rare alien is the focal character here, and has shapeshifting abilities, making him a pretty handy agent. One of the Culture's minds needs finding, and it is found to be on the planet of the dead shapeshifters. So, warmongering Idirans see this as important enough to retrieve in their conflict with the Culture. Our main character has a super-agent hounding him, as well as having to fall in with a sorry arse band of mercenaries with a crazed non-sleeping captain out to participate in a high stakes deadly gambling tournament on a doomed space station."
2,Poor in comparison to his other work,"Iain Banks, with or without the M, is one of my favorite authors, but this is certainly not one of his best works. Much of it is slow moving and aimless. It is a big book, about five times the size of the Wasp Factory, but contains fewer ideas and could have been drastically edited without losing much."
4,The early days of the Culture-who were the *real* bad guys??,"If you've picked up Iain Bank's ""Culture"" books late in the piece, go back in time to the midst of the Idirian war, when men were men, lizards were noble and Minds capable of cowardice. Banks lays down a sombre and infinitely readable plot for his readers. Sci-fi meets pathos meets bug hunt. Highlights: The opening sequence, leaving the ringworld and the train crash. Do yourself a favour."
4,wide range of emotions and a dark storyline,I have enjoyed many of Iain Banks books but I think this is the first one I read. He is a writer of dark unsettling emotions and the hero is never a simple person or being. I like this kind of complexity but many may find it unsettling. The title refers to the people in the book not just the mechanical devices. It is a theme he has used in other books.
4,Iain M. Banks in SF is as strange as Iain Banks in fiction,"The first SF by Iain M. Banks I read (the next three are already waiting on a bookshelf). First of all: Quite good stuff; it is a little boring in the very beginning (probably because you don't know what the story is about - typically Banks) but the story speeds up soon and slows down on the very last pages - like driving a car faster and faster until you crash into a wall. Did I write crash? Fits quite good to the book; the story contains the greatest ship wrecking and the biggest train accident Iever read of. To my mind, Banks must have been inspired by Bob Shaw's ""Orbitsville"" (at least a little) and even more by Alfred Bester's ""The Stars My Destination"". If you liked the latter one you should read this book."
2,Stylish disappointment.,"Great imaginative scenery around a story of pointlessness and depression. If you are going to go to all the trouble of creating interesting worlds with great depth, can't you do something with them that actually adds value to the lives of readers? This story was a huge circle from death and hopelessness to desperation, selfishness and destruction, and back to hopelessness and death. Yuck."
2,Boring and uninteresting characters,"The book is boring and the characters are uninteresting. By the end of the book I just didn't care what happened to the characters, as the author doesn't give you many reasons to like or dislike them.On top of that (spoilers coming) the book plods along. At one point there is train barreling down the track at the ""heroes."" This takes around 30 pages to happen. Unfortunately, there is no suspense, as the characters have no idea it is coming. Thus, they aren't trying to stop it. It was like those old cartoons where two vehicles are heading directly towards each other, and they purposefully go back and forth to make it ridiculously obvious they are trying to create tension. Boring!"
4,A Great Big Universe!,"Read all the rave review about the Culture -- Can't believe it took me so long to find it... but anyways -- I did enjoy visiting that Universe....Lots of interesting places and people --- I was a bit taken aback with all of (practicaly S&M;) renditions of bizare tortures.... & the battles did become a bit tedious at times, well - usualy --- I am certain that the entire bit about 'the eaters' could have been left out entirely! That bit of gruesome perversion was totaly unnecesary and added diddle to the overall story -Sadly, the attrition rate during the endless battles was the one constant... and Considering Phlebas was ernestly illustrated in an unexpected fashion..."
2,Shoddy book with a ending that does not match the rest of the book.,The author of the book seemed to value the enviroment the story took place in more than exposing the motivations and beliefs of the charactors. He jammed most of the charactors introspection into cramped little bursts of exposition which made it feel like they where tacked on later to help the reader stay with the story more than anything else. The ending of the book at about the last one hundred pages felt like he was writing in a total different style than he had wrote the rest of the book in. It felt like the ending was changed last minute or rewrote to better suit the authors idea of how a story should end. Overall the book just seemed to be a series of events the charactors just happend to be a part of with a sadsack ending just for the sake of it.
3,An easy but thought-provoking story,"Louis N. Gruber's novel asks one important question: If Jesus came back, would you believe? What makes this question so difficult to answer is the fact that Gruber's version of Jesus wears a suit and eats ice cream -- no robes and sandals for this guy! So is this modern-day Jesus for real or just another crazy guy claiming he is? Read along to find out!Jay: A Spiritual Fantasy is a very quick read and displays Jesus, his personality, and his teachings as the author perceives them. A very imaginative work that poses thought-provoking questions about religion, prayer, sin, healing, miracles and faith. Short and to the point, this novel is mostly made up of dialogue -- description-lovers, beware! However, if you like to read stories that are quick, light and different, I would suggest this one with confidence. I would be interested in reading a second book by this author."
4,Thought Provoking Fantasy,"Louis Gruber has written a thought provoking spiritual fantasy to answer the question: What would Jesus be like if He returned to earth today? What would He look like? Who would recognize Him? Who would talk to Him? Who would He minister to?Jay: A Spirtual Fantasy contains 269 pages and is very readable as well as logical. The cast of characters includes a dozen ministers that represent different denominations, a rabbi, a psychiatrist, and, of course, Jay.Jay helps the reader to rethink the differences between different faiths and denominations in a humorous way. Televangelism, race relations, Eucharist, prayer, and healing are just a few of the religious topics that are touched on in this book.If you want to examine your own spiritual beliefs, this is definitely a book you must read. While some questions may not answered, Jay will help you in your spiritual growth."
4,"Two short beautiful, somber lyric operas.","""Golem"" is a one-act opera about the legendary clay man created by the Rabbi of Prague. The poignant libretto is by the composer. The music is beautiful and lyric, but has no memorable tunes. Stylistically, it is a bit like Rimsky-Korsakoff's operatic writing. ""Arald"" is not really an opera but a scenic cantata. It tells of the despair of the khan of the Avars over the loss of his wife. The gloom of both text and music put me off at first. On second hearing, I loved it! It is more tuneful than ""Das Lied von der Erde"" and has none of the dissonance of Bartok's ""Duke Bluebeard's Castle"", but the mood is similar."
5,Beautifully understated drama,"Despite a lack of big arias, Golem is a good opera. The singers in this production are very effective in conveying the inner tensions of their characters. Although there is little physical movement, the drama of Rabbi Judah Loeb confronting the monster he has created is intense.The scenic cantata, Arald, is Bretan's masterpiece. It is a lyrical evocation of memory, despair, and resignation. Arald puts the listener through all of the emotional upheaval of Das Lied von der Erde in half of the time. This performance of Arald is as affecting as the best performances of Das Lied von der Erde that I have heard."
2,Boring and Dull...Just like Real Life,"This is a science fiction novel which has explores the human predicament through multiple third person views. Members of the Society of Friends (Quakers) have left earth in a self-sustaining vessel to colonize a new planet. The story explores the relationship of the Friends' method of governance by consensus, fear of change and family. The subject matter was more mundane than is normal for a 'hard' science fiction novel and the change of persective brought interesting insight into how humans live. All-in-all I found it somewhat dull and neither the story-line nor the characters gripped me."
1,I Doze for Days,"To say that this is ""slow"" is like calling Faulkner ""wordy"".This is slower than a paint-huffer attempting to do algebra.Best yet, when things finally *do* start to pick up a bit, and you finally manage to actually identify somewhat with a character -- Molly takes it upon herself to bump the story forward a few years (or a few decades) and squash your tentative link to the narrative immediately.I dig that some authors are convinced that they are ""artists"", not performers, and that as such, keeping readers happy or engaged is not important... But Ms. Gloss has really taken disdain for the reader to an entirely new level with this one.I did not care for it much."
5,COMBAT RECON,"This is a great book and a personal one as my friend, Sgt. Glynn Septer is a key player in it. Glynn had 3 tours of duty in Nam. He earned 5 Bronze Stars (3 with V device), 4 Silver Stars, 8 Purple Hearts and an Air Medal. He was a true war hero. Glynn rests in Arlington National Cemetery today and is missed by many. His son, Gregg, has carried on his tradition as he rose to the rank of Sgt. Major and has had many tours of duty in Iraq."
4,Not To Bad..,"If you like animes based on roller blade action, you should like this series. I had some trouble getting into it as I'm not a huge fan of this type of anime, but if your into this, then you should really enjoy this."
5,Epic anime!!,one of my all time favorite animes!! should have had more then 26 episodes but still awesome none the less.deffinantly dosnt hold back at all.happy to own this on dvd!!
4,sad but true,"man, i absolutely loved this series. the music, the humor, the tricks, the premise????? This show is absolutely enticing and everyone of watches it knows that its faithful to the manga in every way. except.........it cuts the series short at 26 episodes. omg i cant believe how crappy the ending was. by far the worst ending ive ever seen next to Claymore. (another series plagued because the manga still isnt done) Air gear however has finished its manga run. SO SOMEBODY BETTER MAKE THE WHOLE DANG THING. But this is really really great. what i recommend is buy this, then read the whole manga after. it gets pretty crazy and Iki just keeps getting more and more cool.but the ending is the only thing making it shy of 5 stars."
4,favorite anime,the disc were all in good shape and i have the manga's and to finally have it on dvd is awesome. cant wait for more seasons to come out since the book is still going.
2,CA eTrust is a virus,"Do not use this product. It is very hard to remove from your computer. It is harder to install than Norton, and is an inferior product. I will never buy their product again."
2,Don't order from here!,I received this book over a month after I ordered it. I ordered it early so I would have it in time to start class. Obviously that didn't happen. The book has been cut (missing pictures and text) and is in poor condition. I don't believe I would order from these people again!
3,The Triangle Chair,It would have been more useful if it arrived in a timely manner to be used for what I needed it for.
1,Hunk of Junk,"Why I didn't take the time to read the reviews....I'll never know.....sheer stupidity. This is the junkiest junk that ""Roseart"" has made.....EVER! It's guilty of everything listed above and the store took 2 months to mail it. I will never shop without reading a review again :("
2,Disappointing,"Although the content of the video is very good, this actual video is faulty. There are stoppages during both of the workouts. By running other videos I was able to make sure the fault lay with the Jane Fonda item and not my machine."
2,Jane Fonda: Prime Time,Disappointing. This was not nearly as good as her earlier tapes. She does too much talking and not enough exersizing.
5,Love it!,I think this is a great work-out for someone who is older and has not exercised in many years...Jane looks great for her age.
3,Suitable For Geriatric Patients,"I was excited about receiving this work-out DVD, but was very disappointed. I'm 57, have arthritis, etc., but found the work-out very weak and not challenging at all. It might be good for nursing home patients, but it doesn't offer much of a ""work-out"" if you are at all ambulatory!"
1,.No Fonda in Europe,Not at all excited about this purchase. The CD is not viewable in Europe. I should ask for a refund.
1,Lame,"Don't waste your money...this is such a waste of time. Maybe if you're over 90 and haven't exercised in 20 years, otherwise, totally lame."
3,Jane Fonda exercise tape,"Not sure I will use this product. Her exercises are directed at someone 70 or older, but with her new face and neck work, the exercises don't seem to apply. And she pre-supposed that everyone holds their abdomen in like a bullet has just gone through their belly. I'm sure she'll make money. Not sure she's doing any good"
5,jane fonda fit and strong,This video is just great! Jane does a wonderful job of educated and explaining the excersises. I am 58 years old and have had 2 cervical fusion and a lumbar fusion. I just found out this past month that the sharp pain in my left leg and across my lumbar was not just arthritis but a nerve is being impinged above the fusion.I must keep up with my physical excercise. I go the the YMCA 2 times a week to a yoga stretch class and the pool. I must do more at home and Jane's video is just right even for a person with physical restrictions like me. If you think you cannot do any exercise you are wrong because this video is great!
3,"A VERY ""SOFT"" APPROACH TO EXERCISE","I expected more of a workout with Fonda's latest exercise offering. Maybe at age 76 I'm TOO fit; however, this workout is appropriate for those who haven't done much of anything to keep themselves strong and vital."
3,Easy Workout,This is a good exercise DVD if you need an easy workout. The advanced has some good arm exercises and I use it on days when I don't really want to exercise but feel guilty if I don't.
3,nicely done but aimed at a sedentary audience,"Having worked out with Ms. Fonda's original exercise video in the mid-1980s (which was even then a real challenge although I was running five miles daily and in great shape), I looked forward to this one as one more along my current line of fitness and age. Although I am 62, I found that both exercise sets were much too easy and not at all challenging--but would likely be a boon to more sedentary adults or those with chronic illnesses. I'm planning to pull out the old VCR tape of her original video and see how much of it I can muster!"
4,Jane Fonda is fit and strong,"this video has 2 levels and I have done both. it is a good workout for those who are older, obese, or just haven't exercised in a while. I would also recommend it for anyone with a disability that might prohibit them from much movement. There is a warm-up and cool-down which I think is essential for prevention of injuries. I have been exercising with Denise Austin since 2006, and lately Jillian Michaels so am not a novice, but this is a nice DVD for those days when you don't feel like a really difficult workout."
4,Working out with Jane,This workout was a little hard for me for the first time. I had to stop and rest a few then continue. I will use this video once I feel stronger from her first video. It does feel good but it's just a little hard for me right now. I am 69 years old and overwight so I have to start off slow.
2,Fit & Strong by Jane Fonda,"Jane Fonda is very heavy on instruction and encouragement but the exercises are so slow that I got completely bored with the first part of the video. The second part, which was supposed to be more challenging, was exactly the same version of the first although a little bit faster but still too slow and her level of encouragement was boringly repetitive."
2,Wimpy!,"I guess I'm just not old enough to appreciate this one yet. Maybe in another 15-20 years I'll feel differently, but at 53 years of age, this one just doesn't make me work hard enough."
3,The disc its self was easily damaged,"I liked the dvd very much, but the actual dvd disc was of poor quality plastic. Without much use pieces of the workout were passed over. The dvd fit and strong and did not work in my computer. I have not return either one because I don't know if the damage was caused by me, even tough I was careful using it."
2,Boring!!!!!,"I am also 72, I have diabetes for 42 years, a leg brace and cancer.This video is just not challenging enough.Maybe my 100 year old neighbor could benefit from this.Sorry I bought it."
2,Good only for the VERY old or out-of-shape!,"What a disappointment. I loved Jane's original workout, long out of print, but moved on to the Firm workouts at least 20 years ago. (I'm 48.) I tried Jane's Workout #2 on this disc, started FF-ing a few minutes in, and then turned it off completely about halfway through. It's just ridiculously easy, and clearly doesn't reflect what she herself does to stay in shape! Even if she's aiming at older folks, this could be a LOT more strenuous without endangering anyone."
1,Cannot view it,I was not aware that this DVD would not be compatible with my play station! so disappointing! I have never experienced similar problem and it is impossible for me in South Africa to send it back!
5,Jane Fonda Prime Time Fit and Strong,"I had seen her on Oprah speaking about being fit and her new tape. She looks absolutely marvelous for 73. This tape is the BEST. I have used this workout everyday since the tape arrived. It only takes 25 mins it moves at a pace that keeps me interested. I love, love, love it and have made it a part of my morning routine. She is so knowledgeable and an example of practicing what you preach. So glad I purchased it and I didn't have to run out and buy a bunch of things I wouldn't use. A towel, a chair and a pair of dumbell's is all you need to start your morning. I walk usually 3 days a week but I do her workout everyday."
1,I had to prove it to myself,Well she did it again. I wanted to give Ms. Fonda another chance to be a good American and not rip of the public. It didn't happen. I am a 75 year old yoga instructor and look as good (without plastic surgery) and teach mainly seniors.. I feel the video is a waste of my $$. There are so many videos on the market by older gals that do a better workout program but of course they are real people not a phony show-biz gal. This video does not help people to be positive and healthy through exercise. It really does nothing. I wish I could get my money back..
3,jane fonda's workout,"I thoroughly enjoyed being able to exercise in my own home at a pace comfortable for me at my age (63). Although it was a DVD for older women, I felt enough of a workout to make it worthwhile."
2,Too easy for a lightly active 67 year old.,"I purchased this for my mom (who is slightly overweight and has some difficulty with her knee). However, she complained that the video was a bit too slow-paced for her. Unless you're looking for a very easy workout, I would not recommend."
4,Easy and fun to exercise to!,I like the easy way Jane has of suiding you thru the exercises and weights. It is a good exercise guide for my age group!
4,Good program for Boomers,"I was looking for a way to get back into aerobic exercise after many years of a sedentary lifestyle. Although, I do practice yoga I wanted something a little more strenuous. I find that this is a good way to start. I think the routine is fairly easy, the first one being more of a warm-up than truly aerobic. I like that Jane keeps talking through out as though she was with a girl friend. It keeps you from wondering when it will end. :-)This is defnitely not as strenuous as her original program but you know you have had a work-out after finishing."
3,Jane Fonda - Prime Time Fit and Strong,"I was attracted to buying this video after seeing Jane Fonda on Oprah. However, I was disappointed with it because the first segment is spent just explaining the exercises and the benefits of them. The second segment uses the exercises but there is too much talk goinging on instead of exercising. Granted I probably should not have purchased this DVD at all since I wanted something a little more active. I'm a senior and want light aerobics with enough continuous activity to break a bit of a sweat. There was a preview of the second video which seems to be more conducive to my style of exercise, so I have now purchased this video, in Canada, I might add since the postage is only $2 versus $8 from the US."
2,She's greata,"BUT I really didn't like this- I need something faster and more like Jack Lalane- HA it would be good for older ladies, I guess"
5,Great,It's really great. At least when I actually use it. It's good for people who can't do strenuous exercise or with physical limitations such as rapid movement or balance issues.
4,Pretty good,I used to do Jane's Low Impact routine in the 80's and remember feeling inadequate. I was skeptical of this but gave it a try. I am very pleased with this one. My knees are bad but I am trying to keep them moving. This was just right for starting up a new routine of stretching and exercise for those 50+ who have not been active lately. Two levels get you into the habit slowly- before you know it you are doing real exercises and at only half an hour a day saves tons of time and money over joining a gym!
4,Very Easy to Follow,"This dvd is specifically designed for mature adults. It incorporates hand weights, stretching, balance into one nice 30 minute program. She thoroughly explains the process as she goes through the routine. Therefore, its the perfect routine for the average person."
3,Okay,"This is the prequel to ""The Miracle Wife,"" in which we first encounter Nick Colter, Dani Sheraton, and Gem the talking computer. It also reintroduces some characters from ""Jinxed."" Briefly, Nick comes back from a business trip overseas to find that Dani, his former partner's widow, is pregnant with his child. He railroads her into marrying him, and Dani spends the rest of the book trying to pry declarations of love out of her new husband, whose troubled childhood has made him occasionally appear to have no more emotions than one of his beloved computers (which are actually pretty emotional themselves, in a mechanical sort of way).This is an okay book if you can handle Nick's amazing arrogance, but it doesn't measure up to ""The Miracle Wife."""
3,And the bride wore...maternity!,"Nick Colter can't foget the one night he spent with Dani Sheraton. Neither can Dani - their baby's arrival is, well...imminent. But, for nine months, she's kept her pregnancy a secret from him, knowing that Nick's past has left its scars. He doesn't love her, doesn't seem capable of loving anyone. Within twenty-four hours of Nick's return, Dani finds that she's a wife and a mother. Now all she has is a lifetime to teach her new husband about love!Review: The book is light and entertaining. Dani is the widow of Nick's business partner, although how that came about is a bit confusing - I felt like I missed part of the book somehow. The story is sweet overall and the interactions with the computer are hilarious."
4,Maxxair Turbo/Maxx Fan,"Easy Install. Thermostat works very well. Moves a pretty good amount of air, which cools off our hot fifth wheel in a respectable amount of time. A bit noisy even though the fan is on the outboard side of the vent cover, but it is not so bad as to be annoying. Overall, it's a good purchase."
5,Maxxair fan with thermostat,"Item is just as described and is fairly easy to install, the plus side of this unit is it works fantastic. It keeps the air in our RV trailer fresh and on rainy days it keeps the air drier which keeps the windows from fogging up. It is well worth its purchase price."
4,Lara & Reyes Holiday music,I enjoyed the holiday sounds our of the flamenco guitar playing. Once in a while I hear them on Pandora so I thought they would be a good choice for new Christmas music in my collection.
2,Complaint about Wild Planet,"This is a horrible toy!!! The day I bought it I had fun with it for about 30min. but then it broke! This is a review for all of Wild Planet's toys. DO NOT BUY THEM! They may be fun for one day or so, but then they begin to fall apart! THe night vision goggles, they are a green pair of sunglasses and a light on it. You cant even see in the dark! The Lie Detector Watch, give me a break! The only thing that does is give a ""True"" answer almost every time it's False! The waterball launcher goes like 10 feet and that's it! It's also impossible to use! You can always tell if a toy is bad if you see that it has been marked down MULTIPLE times. DO NOT WASTE YOURE MONEY ON WILD PLANNET! THEY ARE A WASTE OF TIME AND ENERGY!!!"
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"DO NOT BUY THIS TOY!! The sensors do not work through plaster walls so it does not work with the unit in one room and the sensors in another room in our house. Running your hand directly in front of the sensors doesn't always set them off. This toy was a big disappointment for my son, who wanted it so much for Christmas, and it was a big flop. Maybe in a new house with drywall it can work, but not with plaster walls. Sensors worked only about 6 feet. What a waste of money."
1,Not as good as it sounds,"This toy is not as good as it sounds.Track movement 75 feet away? more like 15.It also only works in REALLY lit up areas.It also has these stupid little antennas that can be seen a mile away.Take my advice,and get a gameboy game or accesories or whatever.Bottom line,DO NOT GET THIS TOY!!I got it,now I regret it."
4,Awesome Toy!,"I got this toy for Christmas last year, and it is amazing! My cousin and I love playing spies, so we use it to know if there is somebody in a room. The most amazing part about it is that they say that it tracks the sensors from 75 feet away, but my cousin and I put one in the basement and went all the way upstairs and it still worked! It is sort of educational, in that you map things out, like where you put the sensors. It is also durable, easy to hide, etc."
5,It's a great toy,I got this in the mail and I like to play with it. My Mom thinks it kinda noisy so sometimes I use it in silent mode. I use it to spy on people and it really works. It's a cool toy.
5,AWESOME TOY,This toy is so awesome! 75 feet tohough walls this is great. I use it to catch my parents from my friend's house. This toy is a must have if you have pets or a brother or sister. You can put the sensors almost anywhere!
3,The drawing board,The motion sensor part of this item is great but on the commercial they described being able to draw a map of your house and mark where the motion sensors are. I can not figure out how to do this. Other than the drawing part it is great for big brothers/sisters who want to protect their stuff. Also the receiver is portable so you can take it any where. You can also pack the sensors in with the receiver for compact carrying. Unless you are training to be a spy I don't find a high educational value in this toy.
1,Doesn't work very well,"I bought this for my 9 year old and no matter what he did, the sensors wouldn't trip unless he actually touched the antenna on the main console or if he put the sensors right next to the console. I thought it was a very good idea in concept but it is seriously flawed in its execution."
3,Ok toy,"My son is reall yin to spying so i thought this woould be perferct. It is pretty cool except half the times, it doesnt work. Also the lid where you pu t the battery doesn't close. This is fairly good toy, but it could have been better."
5,a 9 year old girl .,one night my brther and i spent the night at my frends huoes . my frend has a brother too .when we got there i showed my frend jessica all my gagets she just loves the spy tracker.the hole day we spy kids sence their is 4 of us it wasn't to find out who we were playing.i played carmen and my brother played juni my frend played geri and here brother gary .i love the spy tracker.
4,TIGHT!!! -11 yr. old,"This is So Sweet! No education, but load of fun! A couple times it doesn't send good alert signals, but anyways: you can cheat with hide & seek! You can take your friend downstairs and take it with you monitoring your room and the way leading downstairs! Even stick one in the garage if wanted!! Make sure to occasionally check the batteries!"
4,Spy Tracker,This works ok but not up to 75 feet like it says on the box. The dry erase pen had no ink in it when I got it. I liked the idea and think it is still pretty cool. The sensors are clip in but are not too easy to clip in
2,Spy Tracker,My daughter had purchased it. She is 9 years old and seemed interested in spy toys. She set it up and played with it for about 3 hours. The sensors do not work well. I believe this is the reason why she stopped playing with it. I only rated the educational value of this toy alittle more because a child may be interested in motion sensors and the thought behind how it works.It was shipped on-time.
3,OK,If your thinking about getting this for Christmas. And your thinking about getting something else I highly reccomend to get the other thing! It gets really boring after a while.I rate this toy 2 and a half stars.
4,this is so cool,"hey guys if your birthday is coming up or xmas, this is a must have because you have all the 3 alarms and the tracker that you can locate the alarms with, it awesome. i am the best spy kid in the world and i have all the spy gears you can ever think of and this is one of my favorites. take my word for it...........buy it now. remember, i know all about spying and i can teach you because i am the best spy kid in the world.written by:the best spy kid in the world"
2,Poor quality dialogue,"The dialogue is bad. There may be an interesting story that unfolds over the course of the series, but Episode I was not a particularly good sell for it. I'm going to pass on the rest of the series."
1,"Weak Story, Cliched Artwork",This anime is almost a throwback to the semi-animated Marvel Iron Man TV series of the 1960's.The semblance ends there. The story line in this anime is more simplistic than the Pokemon series. The artists seem to have taken a very few visuals out of the Iron Man movies and recycled them over and over.The elements of Tony Stark's personality that made the transition to this anime are his ego and ability to chase women co-workers over the course of the series. This Tony Stark doesn't innovate or negotiate.Put the money you would have spent on this series towards the Avengers or next Iron Man movie. Waiting can be fullness.
2,First Episode fails to build the momentum,"The story line is not very appealing like the usual Iron Man series. I liked the Iron Man Extremis 6 part short series much better and that's the direction i would like Iron man to go further. In this Anime series the first episode starts with Tony Stark trying to retire as the iron man, but getting forced back in to game as some villain steals Iron man tech the most advanced one yet, that was being unveiled in japan and piloted by someone other than tony stark. So, it's basically old iron man tech pitted against the new stolen one. Doesn't seem to build the momemtum to watch the rest of series. I am going to pass. I am a real fan of Anime, but this one did not appeal to me with the story line. Giving it 2 starts for trying an anime version of Ironman."
5,Fresh worship to the glory of G-d!,"City on a Hill is an exciting compilation of a new, fresh kind of worship music. The music is not tainted w/pop music beats and music, but is rather a clean mix of rhythm, simple lyrics and a slightly modern beat.This music is not the typical ""churchy"" worship music. It is unique and stands alone in its own genre."
4,A very good worship Cd,"I waited a long time to get this CD and let me tell you, I was not disappointed. It has that great mellow upbeat style of worship music that I love so much. The opening track, ""God of Wonders"" is an absolutely gorgeous song about the Sovereignty of God. Other gems on this CD are ""Stone"" by Jars of Clay, ""Merciful Rain"" by FFH and ""With every breath"" by Jars and Sixpence none the richer. A highlight that makes this CD stand out from other compilations is that most of the songs are colaborations between todays great christian bands like Third Day, Caedmons Call, Sonicflood, Jars of Clay, Sixpence and more. This is a great CD and I would highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys good worship music."
4,"Great artists, good songs","I love all the artists who are a part of this CD: Jars of Clay, FFH, Sixpense, etc... And any song they do, they do beautifully. It was great hearing Jars do worship, since I haven't heard 'em sing like that as much. And hearing Pete Furler (Newsboys) with Caedmon's Call was really cool. The only thing was that a lot of the bands kinda lacked their normal uniqueness. For instance, FFH sounded a lot different than what I love them as. But overall it's great, and it's cool listening to all of these groups on one CD, even though they are from all different genres."
4,"Mellow, but strong collaborative effort","I bought this CD based on the list of artists who participated in the project. Although the album is more mellow than I expected, overall, I was impressed with it. The concept for the album is interesting...bringing together modern Christian artists to collaborate and write new worship songs. If you think about it, that is a pretty big challenge given the diversity of artists and groups on this album. Luckily, they pull it off very well.The songs I liked most on the album are ""God of Wonders"", ""The Stone"",""With Every Breath"", ""Merciful Rain"", and ""City on a Hill"". The others are good, but most are a little softer than I typically like.I recommend this CD to anyone looking for an album full of good (and mellow) worship songs. If you are looking for an album of modern Christian worship songs that will get your blood pumping this is not the best album to get. But, if you enjoy a more acoustic approach to worship music, you will most likely enjoy this album."
1,Don't Bother With This Book,"Fortunately, I had taken a Win2k Server certification class and read a couple of other books before buying this book. Because of that solid background, I identified one blatant error after another in this book, up to about page 50, at which point I literally tossed the book into the trashcan. It was more than just a waste of time. These errors could cause a person to miss test questions on the real test.It's really a shame that Syngress/Osborne finds it too much of a bother to verify the technical accuracy of all their books. Once you've paid for it, they have your money but you don't have a viable product for the exchange.Using Mark Minasi's readable and technically accurate Windows 2000 Server book and lots of time with TestOut and Transcender test questions, I recently passed the Server exam and 2 more with flying colors. But, this book wasted precious study time before I finally tossed it. Please learn from my mistake and pass on it."
2,basic errors,"This is classic. I found it in the first 15 pages. I wonder what awaits in the rest of the book.here are answers to one very basic question asked in two different places about upgrading a mirrored NT server:answer to question 2:""Leave the disk mirroring unchanged..you do not need to break the mirror to successfully upgrade windows nt 4. breaking the mirror only is necessary if you want to perform a clean install.""answer to question 15:""you must first break the mirror sets in all existing servers that have windows nt 4 mirroring...this is not required however, when you are performing a clean install.""question 15 doesn't even mention any software NT RAID5 on the NT4 machines!That's Inexcusable. Expecially since this book is basically just a practice test with almost no information. At least get the answers correct."
3,Tons of questions...,"This book has thousands of questions on the Windows 2000 server exam, but very little background information on where the questions are coming from. This would not be the only book you'd need to take and pass the exam, but answering hundreds of additional questions in the study process has to be good for your review process..."
2,Karadzic/Danicic Translation is not Croatian,"In the days when ""Yugoslavia"" existed under Tito, one might have been safe calling this translation ""Croatian"", particularly in the romanized version. Unfortunately, the language of this Bible is Old Serbian, as it was originally translated from Old Church Slavonic and German in 1868. The 2-star rating is only because of the linguistic mismatch... Serbs (Serbian Orthodox) rate this translation very highly, but Croatians (Roman Catholic)use a different translation, notably one published by Krscanska Sadasnjost in 1996, which uses the modern Croatian language and is similar to the NKJV or NIV in style."
1,no insight inside,"There have been many translations of Lao Tzu's ""Tao Te Ching."" It's a short work, tempting for ""Orientalists"" like Dr. Dale to have a go at it, but he's not qualified to translate it. He doesn't understand the ""Tao Te Ching."" This translation is nothing but his own mentation.The Tao is an extremely ancient practice, and undoubtedly predates the ""Tao Te Ching,"" which is itself about 2,600 years old. At some point, Taoism degenerated into a vapid Yin-Yang cult centered on longevity and alchemical medicine. Ironically, authentic Tao was transmitted by Chinese Zen masters, while so-called Taoists indulged in fantasies trying to concoct some ""elixir."" They wanted to live to be 200, but had already wasted twice as many years."
1,Questionable,"Mr. Ventimiglia started Catholic, spent a few years dabbling in other religions and when people in those other religions disagreed with him he returned to Catholicism. Read his own opinions on his personal web page at:http://www.geocities.com/mark71565/For a book on Wicca I would look for something written by someone serious about it and not some charismatic dabbler who was taking a few years off from Catholicism."
1,Anyone here remember Gerald Gardner?,"All you need to know about this book is contained in these 3 words in the description: the ""ancient Wiccan religion."" It's hard to take someone seriously when they try to perpetuate myths as truth. Makes me wonder what else is inaccurate in the book."
1,Apparently he knows the secrets of the universe.,"I am so pissed off right now. I can't believe this bigot is calling himself a wiccan. I just hope that no aspiring homosexual witch reads this. Obviously he doesn't know that the rede was written in the far back ancient times of the 1970's by Lady Gwen Thompson. And no that was not in the book. Also he is denounced by the founder of his own tradition. As far as the universal life church goes...big deal, anyone can become a minister through there [...]. So obviously he doesn't know anywthing about wicca or the rede. On top of that he is a biggot. He claims that it is a law against nature. Well homosexual activity is in nature. There is homosexual behavior in many animal species. So it looks like the author doesn't know about the nature that he is supposedly worshiping. Aspiring wiccans please run away and get another book. A good one is Gay Witchcraft by Christopher Penzack. Biggotry has no place in wicca."
1,"Oh, please ...","Clearly, Mark V has been hard at work adopting a host of internet aliases to vote in his own favor. Otherwise, this sudden rallying of his cheer squad is completely inexplicable. As for his writing, the only lesson of any value that it teaches, is that no religion in the world is free of its bigots and zealots. Don't buy this book, you'll just encourage him."
1,This is not what wicca is about.,"The cover of this book is so decieving, it's beautiful and elegant on the outside. Unfortunately the author is lacking talent or intellegence, therefore it belongs just where it is on the ""Super Saver's List"". It's up to you, the readers,if you decide to waste your money on this bargain priced book. I think you would be better off flushing your hard earned dollars down the toilet. Enough people that simply don't know any better are putting money in this guys pocket. Everything between these pages, in my opinion, should be dismissed, as it seems the source from which it comes is tainted and ignorant. For a good beginner book check out Phyllis Currott, Scott Cunningham, or Silver Ravenwolf... there you will find an honest view of who we are and what we do. Bright blessings and happy reading."
1,Universal Law vs. The Law of Hate,"Mr. Ventimiglia has proven a true Universal Law -- that small minded, hate-filled, self-righteous people who cannot conceive of the possibility that they could be wrong are present with us always.Hitler thought he was Right, too, and believed that the concept of Aryan superiority was Universal Law.Mr. Ventimiglia's wife left him for a woman, and, thus, he hates all homosexuals. This is not about right or wrong, it's about a vindictive little man lashing out.Do not give him a forum, and don't put a penny in his pocket by buying this pathetic little book."
1,Not My Wiccan Rede,"This book is pretty much one man's unenlightened opinion presented as fact. I wouldn't even call his views Christians since most Christians I know eat meat and many are accepting of homosexuality.This man claims to be an expert on Wicca, yet he fails to grasp the fact that most Wiccans worship The God in his hunter aspect, meaning the aspect that ""kills animals for food"".He states authoritatively that homosexuality is a crime against the Gods, yet fails to realize that many Gods were hermaphrodites and others had their gay/lesbian tendencies.I am a heterosexual woman, yet even I was dismayed and horrified that this man could spout all this hate & venom in the name of Wicca."
5,FINALLY a Pagan with COURAGE,"It's about time someone in the Pagan community stood up and had the courage to speak the TRUTH about the unnatural practices eating away at our society like a cancer.All of you critics, wouldn't you feel more comfortable being a Catholic priest?"
4,"Great Book, Fantastic Truths!","This books is amazing. Loaded with great information. Why wasn't it written 20 years ago before Wicca became so corrupted? Seems that Ventimiglia is the ONLY Wiccan author that teaches what NEEDS to be taught and doesn't bow down to pressure from the sinister sector of paganism. From the looks of the reviews here, seems like most of the people are just upset because of Ventimiglia's moral stand and haven't even read the book. If they have read the book, it is apparent they haven't understood the teachings!"
1,Fundamentalist to the core,"I got this book from a local library and found it easy to read, but unfortunately bigoted and filled with carefully disguised hate rhetoric. His condemnation of homosexuals and people that eat meat flies in the face of nearly all Wiccan teachings. I was very offended by this work and I am a happily married mother of 4!There are many viewpoints out there and that is a good thing- it keeps people thinking. But this book is more than a viewpoint, it is hate. The Wiccan Rede was NOT meant to encourage bigotry or dogmatism, that fact in itself removes ALL credence from this work..."
1,"good subject, but not a good book","You may find this book useful as a starting point for discussion, but be very wary of taking anything in it at face value. I suggest very large blocks of salt, in fact.The book does, indeed, cover the Wiccan Rede couplet by couplet. The author fails to credit its first publication by Lady Gwen Thompson, which makes me highly suspicious of his scholarship. One might get the opinion from his book that its history was completely unknown.The veiwpoints of how to interpret the Wiccan Rede are his own, and do not reflect the views of most of the Wiccans I have met, from eclectic or Traditional backgrounds. In particular his personal stance on homosexuality sounds much more like what I expect from conservative Christianity than from a Wiccan.His personal webpage certainly does more to explain his views than I can, and I suggest you read it before buying any of his books..."
1,Bigotry is never right!,"Mr. Ventimiglia's beliefs are abhorrent and have nothing to do with Wicca. Trying to justify his hatred in terms of ""Universal Law"" is beyond contempt.If homosexuality was against Universal Law, then there wouldn't be homosexuality among animals, and there is. This man has let his own wounded pride dictate his theology. Don't let it dictate yours. His thoughts and words are evil and not worthy of an audience."
3,Description of item,"Ok, I just couldn't help but comment on the description of the VAMPIRE costume I just ordered for my son...the first descriptor says ""Makes a great Easter costume."" Do tell me, how so?? THis review won't make sense after they catch the error and make the change, but it's pretty darn funny now to see this creepy looking little Vampire with a reference to using it as an Easter costume! :-)"
5,Difficult but great,"If you are into brief, solution focused therapy, give anything that Presbury writes a chance. Use highlighter and read actively so sleep doesn't get to you. His points are great, his heady academic language is unnecessary. Presbury would do well to read someone that knows how to reach a wider audience. Jeffrey"
4,NTSC compatible now.,"I had a concern about whether the DVD was NTSC compatible as I had read in the reviews that the CVD was in the PAL format and one review that the DVD was now in the NTSC foormat.I called Amazon prior to ordering to confirm the NTSC format but, as expected, they had no clue. My order arrived and the DVD is in the correct format for playing in US DVD player.However, when I first tried my DVD it would neither play in my computer or my DVD player. I was about to send my purchase back to Amazon when I noticed a mottled, opaque haze over the entire DVD playing surface but after cleaning the disk, the DVD played flawlessly. The DVD, I believe, became contaminated with a residue from the soft plastic sleeve that stores the DVD in the back cover of the book.I had first seen the documentary on fractal geometry on public television and I was completely mesmerized. I wanted a DVD copy for myself and at the $22.02 price it was a ""steal."" I highly recommend it."
5,"Delicious, crunchy, rich, & Smooth","Sweet but not sickly sweet, delicious and smooth with some crunch. Chocolate shouldn't taste this good because I had a hard time stopping with this treat :)They don't make 'em like this anymore.In California, I sometimes buy it in a local European/Russian deli store. Other than that, I'd have to get it online."
5,Splendid work about the Lusitania.,Since I heared about Dr Ballard`s expedition to the Lusitania I have been waiting for this book and I was not let down.The introduction is clear and helps set the scene about the ships history.The text is superb the emotions of that fatefull day easly come apparent for the reader.The photographs are superb.Ken`s paintings of Lusitania sinking are so brilliant one can feel the people struggling for their lives.The section on Lusitania now and then is lovely the underwater photographs are both chilling and haunting.As is the paintings of the wreck.
5,Beautiful Book,"The illustrations and photographs alone make this book worth owning. It is very direct and to the point for the most part.Also of interest is the contrast between Lusitania, a shallow water wreck, and vessels such as Titanic and Bismarck which are under miles of water."
5,Excellent Analogy,"""Swing to Balance"" is an excellent book that uses the golf swing as an analogy for business. You don't need to have any golf knowledge to understand how businesses suffer if they cannot utilize everyone in the organization and coach them to understand the company goal. Thomas Wentz does a wonderful job helping these actual real characters understand how working together for a common goal will result in success. It will transform your business."
5,Powerful lilfe and business lessons through golf.,"Swing to balance is a powerful experience and book. I couldn't wait to see the outcome of the book and who ""got"" the purpose of the excercise and who didn't. Great job on a great book. A must read for the golfer, business person, and anyone else looking for a catalyst to transformational change."
2,High Noon for Natural Gas,The author's hatred for the U.S. is apparent throughout the book. His obvious agenda makes one suspicious of his facts. I consider the book to be liberal drivel.
3,High noon for Natural Gas,"Nice easy reading for non-technical readers who do not insist on verification of facts. Many interesting details, but few data. I have not found any errors or serious omissions, but its somewhat gossippy style is disappointing. The book is not a professional analysis of a diminishing supply or a predicted supply crisis. As is expressed in its title, the book tries to shock and entertain its reader, but it fails to inform."
1,"Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong...",The US will most likely become an exporter of NG in the years ahead due to the stunning successes of oil shale fracking technology.
5,a beautiful doll in the ballerina series,"Having gone through the Nutcrackers, they have moved on to Shakespeare's heroines. Wow, this doll is such a gorgeous addition to the ballerinas, with the new emphasis of Shakespeare.Barbie is Titania, Queen of the Faeries. She is in violet and teal and a glistering overlay of tulle. The bodice is lavender, with organza, pleated, draping from her shoulder. It's fastened by small flowers. The long, dark blond hair hasflowers as a crown. Classic sur la pointe pose in the toe shoes, much appreciated by a former toe shoes dancer!,glittering tights and delicate faerywings, make this doll stunning. Sorry, they did not give her Elven ears!The pictures do not begin to show the beauty of this doll."
5,Best diaper bag for twins,"I never write reviews, but I have to on this one. This bag is awesome. I have 10 month old twins and I needed a more functional bag for travelling - this has exceeded my expectations. It has great pockets on the inside and outside with still plenty of room in the main compartment. There are adjustable mesh pockets on either side - I'm able to fit two bottles, two narrow sippy cups, or two water bottles in each one. I'm able to fit a change of clothes, toys, diapers, burp cloths, formula, pacifiers, sippy cups, etc. for both babies with still room to spare. It fits on my double stroller and is so easy to get things in and out of. It has a great zipper pocket on the top front to hold wallet, keys, etc - this has been fantastic - I can grab my wallet so easily, without having to dig around in a bag. I searched for a great diaper bag for twins and I highly recommend this one. I don't know how I managed without it!"
4,If only Aussie TV soaps were this good!,"The kind of book that gives ""teen fiction"" a good name: light, but not frothy, with plenty of emotion and drama.Original characters with an unusual backdrop: the tropical city of Darwin in the Australian Northern Territory.My wife and I read this on holiday -- and everyone staying with us wound up reading it as well, including two teenagers who both read it three times.Looking forward to more from this author."
3,Sweet & light,"Under the Wishing Star is a pleasant, lightweight romance with likeable lead characters and a romance-only plot. The tone is gentle and, while there is an undercurrent of emotional pain, it never takes on grand proportions.There are a few slightly-less-than-believable moments, but nothing that actually harms the story. The novel does at times drift toward sappiness, but humor or a surprise or nasty relatives brings it back in line. The pace is a tad slow at times, and there is occasionally too much ""telling."" The lead characaters, though likeable, do not stand out among heroes & heroines (nothing sets them apart), and the secondary characters are mostly stereotypes. Again, pleasant but nothing special.This is an enjoyable read, it just doesn't have much to make it extraordinary. I'd love to give it 3 and 1/2 stars, but since that's not possible, I'm going with 3. Its lack of that something special prevents me from bumping it up to 4 stars. It's a pleasant read, just not much more."
4,Beware - this album is almost too much fun!,"If you're not prepared to stomp your feet, sway your hips and just generally let loose, this album is not for you. BBVD brings every bit of their modern Big Band, big sound, foot thumpin' style to every one of the tunes on this CD. Great fun to hear them do their thing with Mr. Heatmiser."
4,Tree Chopin' Good,"Now if you ask me, this is the style of Christmas music you need to be listnin' to before you go out to chop down your neighbors tree to drag it in and use for your Christmas tree because you are too lazy to go out to the state park to chop one down. It gets you in the mood for mischief. I ain't proportion that ya'll ought to go out and chop down your neighbor's tree, I'm just saying that this music will make you feel like getting' up and doing something frisky and possibly naughty.I love it. So does Mama. Junior don't like it, but that boy is as dumb as a sack of hammer (don't tell his mama I said that because she'll have my hide)"
4,Lots of fun,"Great retro holiday record. Also look for Royal Crown Revue's contribution on Maybe This Christmas Tree, equally as charming."
5,The Hipster Spies With His Little Eye Something That Begins With--MR HEATMISER!,"I've been looking for ""Mr Heatmiser"" on an album for years!And their verson is great!2 thumbs up for a great Xmas album.But play Heatmiser year-round!The Hipster gives it a Big Thumbs UP!"
3,Not quite up to snuff,"I've been a big fan of BBVD for years, but this CD just doesn't quite make it. A few very good tracks, Last Night I went out with Santa Claus and Mr. Heatmiser are excellent. A few OK tracks and the two instumental versions of Jingle Bells that just drag on. I was hoping for more, especially after the Christmas CD the Brian Setzer Orchestra put out a couple of years ago."
4,classic Heav&Crew,this was tight back in 89.we got our own thang was the jam as was somebody for me with AL B.Sure.the tracks with Teddy Riley at the Height of New Jack Swing are tight.a Must have.Heavy has his own Style&Vibe.
3,Okay.,"I wanted a desk pad that could double as a mouse pad. This works decently. I dislike the grooved pencil ridges: I don't know who would keep pencils there, and the grooves can be uncomfortable when typing/writing. The plastic itself is opaque, so you won't see the items underneath clearly, but it will hide scratches and scuffs better. The nonskid surface does not work at all on my desk; I am constantly sliding it back into place.I'm still looking for the perfect desk pad, but this will do in the meantime."
1,If interested in unfounded ranting...read this book.,"As honestly and objective as I can be...in reading this, the best analogy that I can make is that Dershowitz had too much wine one evening arguing with a friend about some perverse ""theory"" about the founding father's intentions...and hurriedly scribbled some notes about it and published it in this book. It reads like more of an Olver Stone screen play than a historical treatise (although Oliver Stone's work is much more enjoyable). What I find most suprising is that a publisher like Wiley would actually publish this stuff...I guess they'll publish anything from anybody with a name...right or wrong...as long as there is a profit to be made. Unbelieveable."
1,Supplier screwup,"The supplier dipicted the Fluval 4Plus which is what I really wanted. I know it is discontinued by Fluval but I thought perhaps that they still had some that they could sell. I guess they didn't because they sent the newer model, the Fluval 4u which is anything but anything I'd want."
1,Very disappointed,"I received this filter (actually ordered 2) on Wednesday, installed on Thursday and on Friday, one of the filters was floating in the water. The package claims this filter can either be installed in an upright position or laying flat. The filter I had laying flat was the one floating. The suction cups are only located at the top of the filter, nothing at all on the bottom to keep the filter secure. Very disappointed... I am going back to my old filters (good thing I saved them)."
3,Wrong Product,"Since I was not sent the product in which I ordered and which is listed, I could not review this product."
4,Great filter except my turtles won't leave it alone!!,This is a great filter for our water turtles. The only problem I have with it is that it only has 1 suction cup to secure it to the bottom of the tank and that is on one end. My turtles are constantly messing with it. If another suction cup could be added to secure it to the bottom that would be great.
2,filter flop,"Fluval plus model contained debris much better. This U series simply draws debris to the outside where it is simply released back into the water when unit is disturbed, jostled or unplugged for cleaning."
4,Good Watch,"I've had one of these watches for 5 years and it worked great til I blew the rubber o-ring on the back and water got in. I bought another one. I love the look, the functions and the toughness of this watch. I will probably look for another one in the future when this one finally wears out."
1,Absolute Garbage,I bought both the Power2000 RTC-141 charger and battery (for Canon NB-5L). The combination only worked together once. I replaced the charger and was able to recharge the battery only once more. I then replaced the batttery. It did not charge.
3,Support Your Local or Nearest Opera Company...,"... or go straight to Salzburg or Glyndebourne, and use this $300 for a better seat. The problem with this box of the 'complete' operas of WA Mozart is that not one of the productions is ""the best"" or even ""the second best"" performance available on DVD. And several of them are dogs, yapping hounds in fact. My advice would be to check the reviews of the individual M22 operas; you'll find some satisfaction but a lot of disgruntlement.In defense of the effort, the M22 people were certainly not afraid to take chances. To attempt to redefine the too-familiar. To be creative. And I'm sick of hearing Americans rant about ""Euro-trash"" modernizations. In whatever style, some productions succeed and some fail. Still, if you're such a Mozart fan that you want his complete operatic oeuvre, don't you think you'll want the best?"
5,Complete Mozart operas,"Received this morning this great package of all 22 Mozart Operas recorded live as performrd at the 2006 Salzburg Festival. As yet have only had time to view a small sample of the 51 hours of music on these 31 HD DVD's, but what I can say is that it each one looks very exciting, the diversity in staging and the approach of each director, orquesta and great singers looks great; and in my opinion is a must for all Mozart Opera fans. It's the next best thing to attending the great Salzburg Festival!"
2,Is This Different???,"Does anyone know if this M22 set is different from the recently released ""Mozart: Complete Operas Box"" (ASIN B003R76Q5G) which is listed here on Amazon for $144.99 ? Thanks all."
4,Real good watch,"It's amazingly accurate. Down to the second! And it's solid construction will insure that it's around (and working) for more than a couple of months. It's a little weird looking, but it's worth it to know, for certain, exactly what time it is. Praise."
4,Steady Flow Analysis,"The ""Culvert Modelling"" section was quite interested. The concepts are clear and precise, and the job for entering roadway and geometry data is made simple through the Culvert Editor window in HEC-RAS."
5,superior to other brands,Sturdy construction. Does not leak. Replacement filters are inexpensive. Fiiltered water flows faster than other devices.I would recommend this faucet filter above the others.
2,Disappointing,"Naxos do not often get it as wrong as this. Scriabin is volatile, powerful, with surges of emotions often barely kept in check. This recording is expansive and luxurious, but it fails to get off the ground. The tempi are painfully slow, and the excitment totally absent. A bad disc for first timers, an interesting new look at the works for those who already know his music. Scriabin should never bore. Turn to Deyanova for the real thing, or wait for Hamelin to get around to these"
1,A Totally AWFUL book,"The nicest thing I can say about my reading this book is that I was only too happy when it ended!I would have taken away the star rating and given it about -5 stars but that wasn't an option. I read at least one and sometimes more historcal romance novels a day so it's difficult for me to locate books I haven't already read. I thought I'd take a chance on the author because I didn't know her. It was a huge mistake and loss of good money. My favorite author is Robin Schone, though she doesn't have but a few books out. I will reread her novels. I think Robin is a brilliant author. Ms. Brandewyne however is in another whole class. I mentioned my favorite author so that whomever may read this can know to whom I compare this author to. I hope that it might help others who like the same material as I do from making the same mistake as to purchase this book."
1,The Love Knot,"This book is a total waste of time for anyone who has enjoyedthe author in the past. The story line is fair but the contentand dialogue are absurd. Having read previous publications bythis author, one wonders if she actually wrote the book. It'ssurely a disappointment and doesn't qualify as a literary effort on any level. I would not recommend it as even 'light reading'.She's lost her touch or imagination or both. Not a good read."
3,good,it was good it a good show to watch don't now what eles to write sorry can't thank of any this eles
5,Just like a Family,"I really enjoy the series, ""Sister Wives"" because, although it isn't my religion, it is a show about ""Family"". I has also helped me to see that there really are polygamist's out there that aren't abusive. I love The Brown Family."
3,Enjoyed this,I enjoyed this series I find people who live in different ways interesting. These people seem as real as they can given they are being filmed. Interesting look into modern polygamy.
5,love it,"if people were more open minded, no one would see an issue with this but would openly embrase it and want it for thesmsleves"
1,bad & short,"I have purchased many tv series on amazon this by far was the most disappointing nothing to do with amazon but just the collection was very short and over all not worth the money,really enjoy the show on tv and will keep watching and will just pvr it and watch it that way.just a little disappointing when you cant wait to get it ."
5,One of best Fidelios available,"This is a live performance and is not the same as the studio recording made with almost the same cast and issued on CD. If offered a choice, I would get this video because it's a video, but I have the CD set too and wish to keep both. It is one of Bernstein's best performances and features Gundula Janowitz as Leonore, Lucia Popp as Marzelline, and Rene Kollo as Florestan. Among the videos currently available, this would be my first choice. Bernstein made a slight rearrangement for the Leonore overture No.3 so that it is just a continuation of the vocal duet before it. My only criticism is that the spoken dialogue was shortened too much, and especially I would have liked to hear the brief words of Florestan and Leonore just before the ""O namenlose Freude"" duet, where Florestan asks: O, meine Leonore, was hast du fuer mich getan? (Oh my Leonore, what have you done for me?) To which she replies ""Nichts, mein Florestan"" (Nothing, my Florestan)."
5,Warning,".... This book is Part 1 of at least 2 parts (who knows?).The story of Daedalus does not resolve by the end of the book. You have to read Book 2 to find out what happens to the people who are all in dire straights. I hope Book 2 ends the story, because I don't want to be caught in a hardcover ""soap opera.""That said, I am looking forward to Daedalus Children (Part 2). I only regret that the publishers spaced the books so far apart. I will have forgotten what this book was about by the time Part 2 is ready for sale and I've already sold my copy of this one.By the time this Daedalus story comes to an end, I also hope that it deviates from what has become ""standard"" Star Trek plots (time-space continuum anomalies, etc). I am ready to move on to good science fiction with some new Trek ideas.As far as Stern's ability to TELL a story, he did a good job. I enjoyed his style.Regardless of my concerns, Daedalus is entertaining enough to be worth the cost of the book."
3,Best Enterprise Story - so far,"This was the best Enterprise novel, so far. Yes, it did only focus on Trip and Hoshi, and the supposed villan is removed a little too easily, but it keeps your attention in the current era storyline. The flashbacks are a little disjointed, but will link up to the current story and sequel.I think they should have released it as one book, since the first is relatively short (but that is the way of the Star Trek publishers). Why combine the story into one book for the reader, when you can get 2x the price by splitting up the story until MAY."
4,"Mirror, mirror?",This novel feels a lot like a character exploration of Chief Engineer Tucker. The plot is simple but surprising well done and I enjoyed the read.We spend the first fifty pages on the Enterprise and that is it. We spend the rest of the time exploring a civil war a new alien race and watching Trip struggle with his own first contact procedure. One of the advantages of doing this `off ship' story it is very easy to hit the reset button and get everything back to normal.I was disappointed with the ending--too predictable. The clues and logical explanations were everywhere. I look forward to seeing how this story resolves so I am waiting to get my hands on the second part.
4,Superbly written book.,"Fascinating story, good pacing, good action, deft handling of characters. The only flaw (if one agrees with me that it IS a flaw) is that it doesn't finish. It ends with a ""to be continued"", a practice which, common as it is, I despise. If you don't mind being left hanging until the next book for an end to the story, then consider this a five-star rating."
1,"So, we needed TWO VOLUMES of this?!","This is supply-side economics runamok.The only downside here is that CMH didn't use a larger sample size to test the theory. They should have pressed 6.5 billion of these, one for every man, woman, and child on the planet.Although the sales would have still been ZERO, they would have given much entertainment to all the poor folks in Africa. True, you can't eat a CD, but they can be used for things like, killing ants (via sun reflection), battlefield signaling (via sun reflection), palm tanning (again, via sun reflection), etc. Of course one could actually play them in a CD player, but why chance burning up the motors in a perfectly good CD player?All kidding aside, the musicians are decent, and the singing isn't bad, but when is CMH going to wake up and start producing BLUEGRASS AGAIN? I mean, PLEEEEEASE---METALLICA? M-E-T-A-L-L-I-C-A ?!"
1,No joking matter,"I'm a 44 year old, life-long heterosexual male. I'm a retired Navy SEAL and I hold black belts in two different martial arts. I am an avid hunter and enjoy restoring muscle cars. My wife and I have been happily married for 21 years and I have two rugged sons.Recently, I made a BIG mistake. I bought this stuff as a gag for my buddy's 40th B-day. We all had a good laugh when he opened it and he good naturedly spritzed some behind each ear to play along with the joke. Since then, I can't stop thinking of his deep buttery voice, his mesmerizing eyes and his taut muscular buttocks.I've taken to wearing a beret and drinking wine coolers while listening to Barbara Streisand CDs. I just finished knitting matching rainbow colored sweaters for my newly rescued cat Tom and his partner Jerry. My wife is starting to ask uncomfortable questions.Hoping the effects will wear off before I save up enough money for a lower back tattoo that I may someday regret."
3,Eh,Nothing really enticed me to cook in this book and I agree most would be hard pressed to make in 20 minutes.
3,"A waste of my money, but maybe not a waste of yours.","Had I found this book in a bookstore instead of online, I wouldn't have purchased it. There are no pictures in it, which, for me, is essential in a cookbook. Also, all the recipes sound so obscure, I can't even talk my family into letting me make any of it. None of the ingredients are anything I already have, so making anything from this book would be pricey. However, if you already have these items, and a family willing to try anything, and you don't mind being completely surprised by the final product, then I recommend giving this book a try."
5,This book offers delicious recipes,"I have totally changed the way I cook now. I'm not a vegetarian, but I do want to eat healthy, so this book really came in handy. I have tried several of the recipes already and I'm impressed as to how delicious they are. The book takes you step by step and the instruction is nery easy to follow. What I likes the most is, that the book provides you with many recipes, the hardest part was picking which one I wanted to cook first."
2,Slightly Entertaining,"My daughter got this toy for her 1st b-day, she really liked it for about a week but that passed pretty quickly. She's 18 months old now and brings it out very rarely to play with. Usually she'll take it into a dark hallway to watch it light up. It does have a variety of features and buttons but she really isn't very amused by it, She'll push every other button in the house however."
5,Great toy!,My one year old daughter is still figuring out new things to do with this toy. She's had it for months and although its not something she drags around or plays with daily it is still a favorite. She will frequently find it and play for a few minutes. I've kept it in the bathroom for awhile so I can have a few free minutes to take care of myself. My daughter will sit and give me some free time. That in my mind is priceless!
5,Piano,I gave this toy to my granddaughter at age 1 year. She is now 19 months and still loves to play the piano. It is one of her favorite toys. She can learn her numbers or ABCs or just play music. She loves to dance to the music.
4,Love it!,"My daughter is almost 12 months old and she's had it since she was 3 months old, we play with it before bed time alot, she's known how to push the buttons since she was 6 months old. It's one of her favorite toys! And I haven't had to replace the batteries yet (and for a while there it was definetly used on a daily basis!)."
2,flimsy,My daughter knocks this over everytime and is frustrated that she can't hit the buttons hard enough to make the music.
4,best toy of 2002? I wouldn't go THAT far,"Not Blake's favorite but it's gotten some play. The mirror didn't take long to be scratched to heck and he can't see anything but blur in it now. Decent music and the lights are cool but it doesn't ""do"" as much as other toys so it's not in his pile of all time faves"
4,Good Toy For the Price,"I really like this toy because it is fun for my 12 month old, and not only that it is cheap, small, and not annoying. It works well for us because we like to rotate a lot of different toys to keep his interest, and $14.00 is pretty cheap for a kids toy. He likes to dance to the music."
4,Helps teach shapes,"My 21 month old daughter loves this toy. She is a big fan of musical toys. She seems to learn best through music. She didn't have the toy long before ""circle"" became one of her favorite words. She has had this toy since she was 18 months old and I can see her playing with it for a long time to come."
2,Uhhhhh...,I love this band. Avid doom metal fan here so I can stand the slow stuff. Not many rewards at climax of the songs. I suggest Acre Thrills or Long hair. Also check out Shorty. Though this cd isn't great you gotta give them props for being unique in the 'weird' music world.
1,I just can't say enough nasty things,"I despise this band. I just saw these guys open for Tortoise and their set was excruciating. U.S. Maple are a bunch of poseurs (it makes no difference if they have big hair & spandex or if they're part of the ""cool"" Chicago art-rock mafia, a poseur is a poseur). I love ""Metal Machine Music,"" Beefheart, Pere Ubu, Dark Audio Project, but I still hated everything about this band. Just indescribably bad. Bad, bad, bad! Based on the reviews below, some will take this as a sign they are among the ""chosen few"" who ""get it."" Whatever. If you go to a live performance by this band, take a book (or some rotten fruit). I resent this band for wasting 45 minutes of my life with their self-indulgent posturing."
5,Great for Corgi lover,"If you are adopting a corgi or thinking about getting one, this is the book for you. It contains all information you will need to know to raise such a wonderful creature. Love the book so much that I'm almost mad at myself for getting it so late that now mine is almost 3 years old. :)"
3,Danger!,My 22 month old got her head stuck in the bottom rungs of the cart. I will be contacting the company.
2,STOCK UP ON BATTERIES,"My 3 year old daughter got this for christmas because she loved playing store. Little did we know that if the toy is left in any position other than OFF, the batteries drained by morning. We replaced them 4 times in 2 months before enough was enough. I wish I could get my money back."
5,Loads of Fun for a 4 year old and 2 year old,Both my children enjoy this toy for different reasons. My 4 year old son loves the counting feature and finding the correct items. My daughter loves to push the cart around and return the food items to the cart. It is a terrific complement to the cash register (which we also have). Lots of fun!
4,disappointed with amazon censorship,There was a great satirical customer review of this product that also reflects my opinion of it as well. However it appears that Amazon chose to censor it. I have less trust in the value of the Customer Reviews if they are being censored.
1,Not what I expected for this amount of money!,"I agree with another reviewer who said that there is limited play value in this. Your child can learn colors and counting to 10, and that's about it. The volume is much too loud (even on the low setting) and my 2-year old also spent more time cranking up the volume than he did playing with the cart. We returned it."
4,Wonderful Toy,My daughter enjoys this toy. She also enjoys using as playfood for her kitchen. She puts the food in her pots and pans then loves to serve it to us as a meal.Wonderful and durable.
4,"Great for ""Shopping""",We bought this toy as a Christmas gift for our son a couple of year ago. He loves to go shopping and put things in the basket.Two complaints - Tad keeps falling off the front of the basket and the scanner doesn't stay put.Everything else is great. You can scan the food provided and Tad will give several facts about that food. You can also scan other objects and Tad will make an unspecific comment so that your child still gets feedback.
5,What A Fun Toy,I bought this toy for my 4 year old son and he loves it. I like it because it is educational. We love nearly all the Leap Frog Stuff.
4,A sweet toy,"My son loved playing with this toy at a friend's, so I ran to get it when I found an amazing sale price. Unfortunately, I may have waited to long. At 3-1/2, he became bored with the toy right away. It's a little too low for him to push at this age, though he is tall for the age range.As with other reviewers, our frog falls off too. I pushed it on as hard as I could, even pounding it with a tool, but it comes off easily and is not ""permanently installed"" as the instructions state.The games are simplistic, ideal for ages 2-3. It bothers me a bit that the scanner works *anywhere* on an item, not just on the label as it does in a real grocery store. My son is intelligent enough to think this is a defect, too, as he has seen how real grocery store scanners work many times.The toy shopping cart is sturdy, and so are the cute groceries and the scanner. This is a nice toy overall, well worth having if your child is still of the age of learning numbers and simple food terms."
4,Good toy- get a 2nd job to pay for the batteries!,"I have this toy for my 3 year old & 18 month old boys. Both like it very much; but yes the voice is annoying and somewhat loud even in the 'softer volume' position. It does use a lot of batteries, unless your toddler is conscientious enough to remember to turn it off. (Yeah, right!) The frog keeps popping off on mine, but is easy to put back on. I am a little disappointed because when I purchased this I had read there would be additional foods to purchase in the future...I am still waiting."
5,Great toy!,"We bought this toy for my son's 2nd Birthday and he loves it. It is very durable and with stands not only the ""crash"" test but also the ""climb"" test in our house! Our son has played with the cart regularly for 4 months and we have not yet had to replace the batteries. It has even been left in the ""on"" position for several days."
2,A Good Cart But...,"My two year old son got tired of it very quickly. While it's more educational than your run of the mill shopping cart, I feel that it's a bit limited in its educational value. I guess if your child doesn't already know colors and numbers then it would be more worthwhile. It's not a good cart for pretend food shopping because there isn't much room in the cart. The worst part is that the volume is right on top by the game selection. What were they thinking?? We ended up putting a piece of tape over it because my son had more fun turning up the volume than he did ""shopping"" with the cart. I love Leap Frog products but this isn't one of our favorites. I think a child would have more pretend fun with an inexpensive cart and a bunch of different types of play food."
4,Shopping Cart Review,My two year old daughter loves this toy. BUT it goes through batteries like crazy. It does not automatically shut off so it seems that when she leaves the toy for the night the batteries get drained.
4,"Great toy, very educational","I purchased this for my daughter when she was 18 months old. She spends hours playing with this toy and has learned to count very well from using it. It is durable as she is a climber and does get in the cart from time to time. I really don't agree with what previous parents said about it going through batteries quickly. As long as you turn it off when not in use, there are no problems. We have had the same batteries since Thanksgiving. I feel that the educational value is excellent with this toy and I would recommend it to parents. The children will enjoy it!"
4,A good introductory overview of the subject,"As the title indicates, this is a basic introduction to the topic of Knowlege Management (KM). For that purpose it does a good job of covering the subject and providing a basic outline for planning your own KM implementation in your organization. It's not ""the only book you'll need"" to implement KM, nor does it claim to be, although more details on references would be a good addition for those going on to the next level."
2,Dissapointing.,One can tell from the title that it is not an advanced analysis of the topic but even though I am a novice this book was too simplistic. I was hoping for a much better guide to the difference between data and knowledge but gained nothing.
5,Great Introduction to KM,I'm a newbee to KM. I was looking for a clear and concise explanation that would enable me to take some baby steps without being overwhelming. This is it.
4,"Good Information, But...","1. There is a need to define the target audience for this book. The book's title would suggest that it is directed at the complete novice in the field of knowledge management. However, the book goes way beyond the basics of KM. In some instances, you are made to feel as if you are a CKO in the making, which obviously is not what the title conveys.2. The author goes a bit too personal in recounting certain anecdotes or events which are used to illustrate the points in the book.Overall, I would say very informative."
5,An Excellent and Understandable Reference,By far the most useful of all my KM references. An excellent choice if you are trying to initiate a KM effort in your organization and to help people understand what KM is and isn't!
4,KM is not for dummies or idiots,"I have been reviewing the literature of Knowledge Management (KM) for over a year. I am surprised how much is written about KM, but how little it is employed in the workplace, learning place, and government. The Complete Guide is a fine introduction--even though it is five years old, providing the core concepts and a well-rounded Glossary of KM.Now, if we could only get the decision-makers to collaborate with us fire-starters and implement KM, we wouldn't be idiots for lack of access to knowledge resources."
2,Lacks consistent core subject matter,"On the face of it, knowledge management appears to be valid and important. The term carries weight. But after reading this book, I felt there wasn't a clear body of knowledge to knowledge management, at least per this book. Everything and nothing is knowledge management. We all do it and nobody in particular does it. My conclusion is we won't see lots of knowledge manager positions open up under normal circumstances, unless somebody develops the field much further. While many points are valid, and the author tried mightily to wrest a subject out of disconnected thought processes, I cannot recommend this book."
2,WRONG INFORMATION,It's not a 850/1800/1900 as amazon says .. It is 900/1800/1900 .I alredy sent an e-mail to costumer service . But they didn't change yet . And probably never will .
5,Great phone but not At&T USA compatible!,"As another reviewer noted, the listed description of this phone is wrong, read down to the detailed specs and you will see. It is not 850mhz compatible, actually it is 900mhz, so it will not work with AT&T in North America. For that, you'll need to go with the Nokia 6120 or 6300, which are similar in features and do actually offer 850/1900mhz."
4,"Wow, True Love Finally Wins","LaJill Hunt has done it again. JaKoby Jackson meets Chrys. They share a special courtship that leads to love. While they both have their share of baggage (JaKoby an ex that won't take the hint and Chrys an soon to be ex-husband). They decide to take their relationship to another level. Like all good things, they experience some hurt and pain along the way. However, when love is right, nothing can stop it. Kudos to Ms. Hunt on another job well done."
2,"Without a title index, it is a nightmare to find the poem you are looking for","The poems are grouped into categories under headings like ""Counter Attack and Other Poems"" or ""Picture Show,"" but there is no alphabetical index of the poem titles. Since there are several hundred poems in this book, it is a nightmare to have to scan the entire table of contents (a 13 page list of titles) to try and find any given poem that you are looking for."
5,Perfect for overnight travel,"Slim, fits travel size toiletries best. Fits in my carry on. Durable outer and zip pockets inside. Perfect for quick trips of less than a week."
5,Comprehensive,"Even after 10 years, this is still one of the most cited books about working with reflection in the composition classrooom. The categorization of different types of reflections is extremely useful, especially when coupled with discussions of limits and benefits of using reflection. A must read."
4,Idea Collector,"This book is full of prompts for information about everything you'll need to write a book and it helps keep all your notes in one place (a nice convenience).It has fill in the blanks for all types of information including your plot, the action, scenes and tons of pages for all the characters of your book (main and minor).It also has a section in the middle of the book called 'Scene Sequence' where it has tons of lines for you to place your scenes in order.I think this book is well worth the money to organize your writing and keep things in one location for you, but unlike another reviewer suggest, I wouldn't suggest buying one for each project. Once you buy one you can use the format to keep any other future projects in a binder or notebook of your own."
4,An Easy Read,"Best known as the author of All the King's Men, Robert Penn Warren wrote this short (114 pages) book after Confederate President Jefferson Davis had his U.S. citizenship restored in 1979 during the Carter Administration, some nine decades after Davis's death. When this took place, Warren returned home to Todd County, Kentucky for a ceremony honoring Davis's posthumous reinstatement. As it turns out, Jefferson Davis, like Warren, was also a native of Todd County, and this book is Warren's memoir, a reflection on the ironic, sometimes sad life of the only president the Confederacy ever had. This rumination was so engaging I couldn't put it down. I read it in one sitting, captivated by the quality of story-telling and the poignant southern nostalgia it evoked."
4,Good outline of the life of a great and troubled man,"This is a concise - 114 pages - but no less impressive and comprehensive look at Davis's life than some of the longer biographies out there. Warren, like Allen Tate before him, sees Davis as a great man but deeply flawed. He could quite possibly have won the War Between the States had he not been so rigidly dedicated to the principle of state's rights. He was too much the gentleman to do what was necessary. Lincoln, on the other hand, was a pragmatist, and had no qualms about suspending the constitution to achieve his means; he thought he was saving the Constitution by defying it!A sad tale of greatness thwarted by principle. Warren composed this essay in honor of his fellow Kentuckian, whose U.S. citizenship had been restored that year - 1979 - by an act of Congress. Warren writes with verve, wit, humor, and insight."
5,Hottest trance song right now!,"This and Where are You Now? by Ian Van Dahl have to be the best two current trance songs currently playing on the airwaves! This 9 track CD is exceptional, with each of the first 6 being so good and close to the original, I can't chose a favorite. None stray very far from the main song, as so many other trance singles go over the top with complete melody altering versions of the song. This is not the case here.The last 3 tracks are instrumentals and don't do much for me, as this song is made by Candee's voice. Her vocals are amazing and the lyrics run very smoothly (unlike so many other trances songs that try to fill the music with lots of unmoving, out of ryhthm words).One thing for sure is, we need more from Candee!!! I haven't heard or seen any other signs of a second single yet, but there has to be more from this beauty!!"
3,"Average performance, terrible levels","I just finished listening to all of the Tintner/Bruckner symphonies a few times each. This is one of the 3 I am not crazy about. Least of all is symphony 3, then 8, and then this ""gem"" as some have hailed it. I am in good company, even Bruckner did not want this symphony out in circulation. Tintner's rendition is my only exposure to it, and for that I am thankful. It is interesting to listen to Bruckner from the start of his symphonic career.The real gem from Bruckner's early work is Symphony 0. I have Haitink's, Barenboim's (CSO) and Tintner's renditions, all excellent.The alternate 4th symphony finale is also my first hearing and is interesting to listen to when it can be heard! About half of the 19 minutes would be a flat line on a heart beat monitor. This track has by far (let me repeat, BY FAR) the crapiest recorded levels of the entire 11 CDs. It definitely either needs a burial at sea or remasterting."
3,Still happy 3+ years later,"I bought my V3 in February of 2005 so this is a long term report. I've shot at least 5000 photos with it over the years and I'm still happy with it and it hasn't broke or gave me trouble. I came to this from years of using a Canon F1 and EF. Outside of the cool factor, I can't say I miss my old film cameras. Don't miss the weight on my neck either.Just ordered the Sony HVL-F32X flash unit for this since I have confidence that I'm not ready to move on to another camera until I forced to by circumstance. Hope I don't drop it ;)WesNot so happy now (2012). I learned a few months ago that the shutter button has a habit of breaking off. On a fairly expensive camera, a tiny piece of under engineered plastic that is critical failing is not acceptable. Lowered rating from 5 to 3 It was a great camera for its time."
4,It is very good camera but has some limited,"It is very nice camera just like a lot of people wrote. Here I only want to point out cons. in this camera as follow:1. No wide angle option like canon s60, pro 1.2. No good marco option ( minimum distance is 10cm, it is hard to shoot small object. but canon pro 1 has super marco so that you can shoot object as close as 2.4 cm).3. Built-in flash is not very effective ( effective range is only less than 3 meters), fortunately, this has hot shoe but external flash is very pricy.4. you need memory stick pro to use high qulity vedio. it is very costy."
4,"Yer actual ""New wave"" in action","I love the way it starts, with an almost traditional alternative rock rhythm, on all the wrong instruments, before it gives way to familiar sounding piano, harpsichord and gorgeous neo-classical songs. It would be entirely wrong to suggrest that this is inaccessible music - it's delicate, hard, soft and fascinating. Their own voices grow too. wheras several times in the past, the shadow of Michael Nyman has drifted over their albums, more and more, they sound like nothing else. Buy this album - give them your money, they probably need it with there being ten of 'em."
5,Amazing. Do yourself a favor.,"Much like previous work from the band, the new disc is utterly unlike anything you will hear elsewhere. Haunting, resonant, beautiful, it is difficult for me not to sound trite or fawning. Buy it and listen to it many times, purchase a copy for an unenlightened friend while you are at it."
1,"Imagination Desk, good concept but doesn't work","I got this for my son, It sounded great, but the cover that holds the paper keeps comming off and the cover for the crayons also kept comming off, and to keep putting paper in and out to color was just too much for kids. Maybe if they had a constant roll of paper with refills or even have it computerized it would work, but it wasn't built for young children."
3,Dissapointed....,"This is my third purchase of LEAPFROG toys and I am still quite dissapointed with it. The toy claims that it will help kids to learn i.e. alphabets and numbers, but this is only fun for coloring. Rather than buying this toy, I think my money would have been better spent on buying many coloring books and crayons."
1,My son doesn't like this,I ordered this for my 2 and 1/2 year old son based on all the good reviews. He already colors well and knows his alphabet so I thought he would really like it. But it just annoys him. He hates being quizzed while coloring and for the games you just sit and point with a crayon and he grows bored quickly. We'll put it away and try again in a few months but for now he has more fun just coloring on regular paper without all the electronic distractions.
1,Stupid thing never worked,"My son received this as a Christmas present and was extremely disappointed when it didn't work. It just kept saying over and over, ""please put it a new page"" even when you just put in a new page. Tried everything and never could get it to work - it was just plain annoying & frustrating."
1,"Poorly designed, does not behave as it should",My 3 year old loves other leap pad toys but the very poor design of this one really frustrates him (and me ). When he is colouring in he presses hard with his fist on the rest of the paper - this causes the rest of the page to 'react'. So he could be colouring in the letter 'e' and pressing with his fist on the letter 'g' - the result? misleading and confusing dialogue telling him all about the letter 'g' when he is colouring in 'e'.Also the go circle doesnt always work so he ends up baging on it and calling it 'stupid' - out of the mouths of babes...
3,"good idea, never worked right",I bought this for my daughter (age 4) for Christmas last year...She played with it for a day or so before the extra plastic part to hold coloring pages wouldnt click in or stay put. This really frustrated her as she had to have it held while she would draw. I told company about problem and they offered me $10 off new one. Not a great deal. I would be leery unless they fix this problem
