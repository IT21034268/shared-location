2,MEDIOCRE AT BEST,"Well, it's an OK book, but not earth shaking.I, too saw the USA Today review and picked up the book for a graduating relative. I read it before giving it to him and found it lightly amusing with decent information. 'Mediocre' describes it best.What I find odd is that nearly every single review on here has similar verbage with the same number of stars.Of course, authors would never post fake reviews to pump up their Amazon ratings. But it is strange that such an average book would have such stellar reviews with no dissention.I'm just sayin'.Good luck.-JQ"
1,Not what I expected...,"I recently graduated from college and thought this book might give me some insight and help me with making a smooth transition from college life to the ""real world."" The reviews I read about this book were all highly positive so I figured it had to be decent. I paid 75 cents for this book plus 2.50 for shipping. It wasn't worth it. There is some but very little useful information in this book and it is written from a woman's point of view. When the author does actually give useful information it is very brief and goes into little detail. I would say that 90 percent of the content of this book is useless. I have no idea what all of the good reviews for this book are talking about. Save yourself the trouble and try a different book."
5,the post-grad bible,"I just bought 4 copies of this book for my brother and his roommates who are graduating in 3 weeks. It's tough to enter the ""real world"" and recent grads don't always want to take advice from parents or older siblings. (I know I didn't - thought I knew everything!) I read a review for this book in USA Today and then looked through a copy that someone in my office had ordered and thought it would be a great gift.This book has a ton of useful advice and you can tell that it is written by someone who really wants to pass on the information. A family friend gave me a book about life after graduation a few years ago and despite the book's boring approach I did find it to be useful. Rebecca Knight's book blows that one away and I would really suggest buying this for any college student or recent grad that you know."
3,A good read,"Although I gave it three stars, I actually really recommend it. I got it as a graduation gift in 2003 and found it very helpful -- mostly for the making friends and living on a budget sections (I had a car and a job). I found the car information helpful too -- I was a 21-year-old girl who didn't know a thing about buying tires or rotating them or taking care of a car. When I finished it, I passed it on to my friend who graduated in 2004. It wasn't boring (and I get bored with those helpy, advice books)."
5,This Is One Of My Top Ten Favorite Pound Puppies Movie.,This Movie Is One Of My Favorite Top Ten Favorite Pound Puppies Movie. I Used To Rent This Movie When I Was Younger (about 5 or 6-years-old). And I Just Love It. The Movie Starts Off When A Beautiful Female Dog Is Running Away From Two Mean Dog-nappers. When They Didn't Find Her. She Caught By The Dog Catcher. And The Dog Catcher Take's Her In The Dog Wagon. And Drives Off. While Inside The Dog-Wagon She Meets Cooler And The Others. So If You Want To Know What Happens Next. You Should Buy This Movie. And That's The Bottom Line.
2,not a great purchase,"The graphics on this shirt are great, but the quality of the T-shirt is poor. The material is very thin and not what I had hoped for."
2,Not as described,"Description says ""Drain has a push button release"". This is not correct, there is no way to close this drain."
5,Just what the plumber needed,"When our old vessel sink started to leak, we had to get a new drain. This one exactly matched the one we originally had so it was perfect."
1,QUESTIONABLE PRDUCT,"i FOUND THE VINYL CLEANER NO MORE EFFECTIVE MANY OTHER HOUSEHOLD CLEANERS SUCH AS 409. THE 303 VINYL PROTECTOR LOOKS OK BUT RUNS OFF IN THE RAIN JUST LIKE SOME OF THE LESS EXPENSIVE VINYL PRODUCTS LIKE ARMORALL. FOR THE HGIH PRICE, I FELL THE PRODUCT IS OVER-RATED."
4,Well worth using for your convertible top,"I have been quite pleased with the 303 convertible top products with my 1999 Miata.Here is the procedure I use: First, I clean the top with the 303 convertible top cleaner. I use the garden hose to thoroughly rinse the top. When the top is dry, I apply the 303 protectant, rubbing it in completely until it is dry. The top looks like new once I have completed the job!The 303 protectant bottle has a tendency to overspray just a bit, so after the protectant has completely dried, I wash the remainder of the car. This removes any trace of the protectant on windows and the car body. The protectant does not damage any car finishes. But if I had to point out one fault with the protectant, I would say it would be better if they had some system to apply the product without so much overspray."
5,"Can't say it was a great read, but it served its' purpose!","I needed this book my senior year of high-school and about halfway into the semester I apparently lost this same book that was issued to me by the school. ( I seriously think it was stolen, or it disappeared with the rest of our economy HAHA ) So I needed to get a new book that was the exact same one, and my school was going to charge me around $60.00 to replace it. I instead decided to take things into my own hands and bought this used for $4.00 to replace it myself, which saved me a lot of money. The book was in fantastic condition and showed hardly any evidence of previous use besides the one or two blank sticky notes inside of it. By the end of the semester I was able to return it to the school ( with a little convincing of my Vice Principal, who couldn't stop laughing when I told him how much I paid for it ) and I didn't owe the school any money. Yay!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money .....,".... on this piece of junk. I used it twice, then the battery died. You can't find a replacement battery for it, and the places that sold these cheap ripoffs want nothing more to do with them -- or you. Save your money."
1,Great light for about 5 minutes,I stumbled upon this light on Amazon and had to laugh at the price (and the light). I got one of these on sale for less than $10 delivered awhile back. You cannot use the light when it is plugged into either AC or DC and the instructions say wait for 5 minutes after you unplug it to use it. This light does produce a very bright beam of light but it only lasts for about 5 minutes. That's not long enough to really do anything like camping or hunting with it.
4,need replacement battery,Wonderful product however I need a replacement 6 volt rechargeable battery.....question is ..where do I get one....???thank you
3,Likely Good for Beginners,"Although this product would likely be excellent for beginners, I found it to be way too easy for intermediate or advanced players. I also found that the content might be better described as music theory for bassists (although there is some basic ear training included). If you are an intermediate or advanced player you may want to pass on this one - check outEar Training for the Contemporary Musician- I consider myself to be a reasonably advanced bassist and that book is really challenging me (in a good way). If you are just starting out playing bass you might find ""Complete Bass Guitar By Ear"" to be helpful."
2,Didn't like it,"I really tried, but I just could not stay with this movie to the end. It was just plain boring...."
2,Encylopedia of anthropology,"It was useful in my course in cultural anthropology because I was able to use it as reference material, but it was outdated and stamped for disposal. I guess getting me to buy it was better than just throwing it out!"
5,love it,"I love this video! I always feel like I have had a good workout after I do it, and it's fun and it works. It starts with an awesome warm-up, and then it has six seections of fat burning fun. It ends with the best cool down ever. The workout is complete with modifiers, borg scales, heart rate checks, body checks, fat burning charts, and muscle reminders. I recemend this exercise video to anyone that wants a good workout."
5,Still A Great Workout!,"This is another old workout tape from Kathy Smith, but if you like aerobics, you will like it because it gives a great workout. Kathy gives excellent instruction, along with modification for beginners. It takes close to an hour to complete, too, which is a nice change, because so many workouts are of a shorter duration."
4,Good old fashioned Cathy workout,"Everybody knows that Cathy is the queen, but that doesn't mean that she never comes up short. This workout is too long, and it bypasses ab work. For that she gets one star taken away, but if you got 70 minutes to spare and more time to work your abs, then this is a great workout because it well works your arms, cardio and legs. It's a great way to burn off dinner!"
4,Good For Beginners,"I have been a fan of Kathy's for about 5 years now and decided to explore other tapes because I was getting tired of the ones that I have, Like Weight Loss Workout, Lift Weights To Lose Weights, Cardio Fat burner, Pregnancy Workout, and Fat Burning Breakthrough. I read the reviews on the Fat Burning Workout from 1988, (which don't bother me)and thought I was gonna have a great workout. Yes, I broke a sweat, but nowhere near as much as I did in the Weight Loss Workout. If your a beginner, this is a great start BEFORE you buy the Weight Loss Workout which is one of the best workouts I ever had, I did that one for about a year. But in this video,I do like the fact that your getting both cardio, and strength at the same time throughout the workout, but a little to easy, ESPECIALLY if you like a lot of cardio. Great workout for beginners, and lazy days."
3,A pleasant short book about the importance of sharing,"PROS:- Easy to read in one sitting.- Healthy message.- A subtle religious tone.- Memorable anecdotes.CON: Not such a big secret.CONCLUSION: It's risky to call a book ""The Secret."" It sets up high expectations, which most books may fail to fulfill. With such a title, I expected to be wowed. I wasn't. But it's still a good book that makes for a perfect introduction to Kabbalism and religion in general."
3,Not What I Was Hoping For,"Though this is an inspirational and simple read, it is not what I was hoping for."
1,Sharing?,"Share this!, Mr. Berg. I read it in an hour, glanced back through to see if I missed something so perhaps spent an hour and fifteen or twenty minutes on drivel, ancients and wisdom, my eye. There's more philosophy in anything by Carlos Castenada on peyote. There's a saying that everytime you open a book you learn something, this is an exception to that, although I did learn for the thousandth time, Buyer Beware."
2,Purchased the wrong book,"Was the wrong book,,,,,,,,,,I meant to purchase the other Secret book,,,,,Cant' truly rate this book,,,,only read some of it."
3,"Simple, yet thought provoking","Extremely simple, yet thought provoking. This is one of those short books that you read in one or two sittings. The purpose or theme of this book is to promote sharing and caring. The concepts are not extremely deep on the surface, only upon meditation do the ideas expand. If you read just for the sake of reading, this book will be a waste of time for you. If you're capable of challenging and motivating yourself, it may be worth your time. The short stories resurrected from the teachings of Yehuda Ashlag are entertaining yet teach simple truths. The main reason for my less than superb ranking is that I believe the price is too high for this little book. However, one must give credit to the marketing team who will no doubt exploit the success of Rabbi Berg's previous book as well as people's insatiable desire to know that which is called ""secret."""
2,The Secret is So So,After all the hype on this book I was disappointed in it's content. It left me feeling uninspired and the author is a bit intense and condescending. The parables were a stretch.
2,Beware - This toy is really small!,"You might not be able to tell by the picture, but this toy is really small. Smaller than a traditional matchbox car - our son loves cars that ""pull"" other things, so we thought this would be a perfect gift for him. It turned out to be too small, and we had to send it back."
3,"Initial IDM-1252 10.2"" Portable DVD Player","I was somewhat uncertain about buying a electronic on amazon. In the past I have bought cd's. When the package arrived everything was there. I was excited to get it so fast. It has been about 3 months now but last month I could not get the DVD started. It sounded like it could not switch gears. I read the trouble shooter guide. It said that maybe it had condensed inside and to leave it on for an hour with out a dvd. After an hour it worked. I have two 7 inch DVD players and this never happens with them. One is a Polaroid and the other is Initial. Is anyone else having this problem with the Initial IDM-1252 10.2"" Portable DVD PLAYER? I am not sure if I would ever buy another electronic on AMAZON.It is hard to find a 10.2"" portable dvd player in Best Buy or Circuit City."
2,Nice Picture but had to return it !!!,When I opened this item and played a DVD it was an awesome picture and I loved everything about it. But when I opened it up a couple of more times the part between the monitor and base itself didnt sound right. Then I returned it for another one and the same thing happen except the part that holds the moniter and base together was cracked. Needless to say I gave up and bought a sony.
3,Think Geek Sucks,I do not know how much fun this toy is. I purchased it from this website from a companey called ThinkGeek and it still has not arrived. When I ordered it the information stated it was in stock but now it is several weeks overdue and my son is about to be very disappointed. I will not be ordering from this companey again without some form satisfaction.
5,What the Church is Missing...,"In his latest book Dr. Crabb continues his exploration and pilgrmimmage into what should make the body of Christ different, both individually and corporately, from the rest of the world. How do we interact with others, in a meaningful way, in a supernatural way, in a way that genuinely helps them walk with God? Not through just encouragement, not through just rules, but through a dance with the Spirit, as he likes to put it, that makes us humble and dependent and powerful, all at the same time. Excellent mind-stretching material to make you think and reflect on how to better enter people's lives in a rich and God-soaked way."
2,Here a hint get some real Flemish speakers,"Being Flemish myself I know how little my own language has changed the people singing here don't the first thing about it, and think they are singing German, by the way not the same thing. If you are looking for real Flemish medieval songs, this would not be it, the songs are OK not to great as far as medieval music goes, yet it is entertaining. I would say learn Flemish if you are going to sing it please so I can actually understand you when you sing. I othere then that if you don't care about being able to understand then I guess you will like it"
1,annoying!!!,"mambo, cha cha cha...with a Cheri O'Teri cheerleader style voice? aghh...not what I call conducive for a fitness environment.she has a 2-3 minute intro, which you CAN'T FORWARD. that is annoying as well.the work out is easy and I will NOT be able to play it again, b/c of how annoying she is...I wish I would have read reviews b4 getting this. I don't see how this will keep me fit at all, it may just make my m/s worse~"
4,Fit & Firm review,This product is great. Easy to do yet effective. I starting using it at 33 weeks. I like that you can select which workout you want instead of doing the same one over and over.
4,review for fit and firm pregnancy,I thought the dvd was fairly good. The exercises are safe and well-explained. I think Denise is her typical enthusiastic/annoying self. Probably a good tape to do but not overly challenging.
4,"fun, uplifting, and customizable","This is good exercise custom made for pregnant women, delivered with Denise Austin's irrepressible 1000 watt smile and good cheer. you can select different chapters to correspond with the stage you are in your pregnancy, or you can jump around as it suits you."
1,Denise Austin...no thank you!,"I only got about 5 minutes into this workout dvd and turned it off. Denise Austin is NOT FOR ME, especially while pregnant. I ended up just doing my own exercise routine. She is too fake/high energy for a lot of irritable pregnant women. But this is just my opinion."
2,Easy and cheesy...,"This is not a challenging work out at all. The cardio portion is not long enough and barely had my heart rate up. The toning section is ok, but she doesn't do enough reps on any exercise.I'm sorry to say this, but Denise is beyond perky and irritating through the whole work out as well.This might be good if you're a beginner, but not a satisfying prenatal work out otherwise.Why is it SO hard to find a prenatal work out this both safe and challenging???!!!"
3,Enjoyable,"If you love Denise Austin, this workout video is no different. I didn't think i was going to get a good workout for trimester 3, but with little movement and lots of streching, i felt much better after i worked out with this video. I would recommend for someone who is an every now and again workout video viewer."
4,Good,"It seemed to be a good work out while I was pregnant, but it didn't help keep the weight down at all and I exercised at least 3 times a week."
3,annoying but a good subsitute for a 20min walk.,"this instructor is insincere and an automaton. The workout is very easy, but it gets you moving and the steps are kind of fun, so I turn the volume WAY down and try to ignore her annoying and repetitive words of encouragement. This is perfect for someone who doesn't work out or exercise much and wants to ease into it. I do this workout when I'm not in the mood to do a real workout that makes me sweat. This one is just fun and at least I can say I got my butt moving and heart-rate up for the day."
1,Not for fit women seeking a good workout,"Unfortunately, I found this DVD to be discouraging and almost embarrassing. For any woman who is already fit, I would not recommend this. The video is extremely low impact, I don't think I was able to get my heart rate up at all. There are no useful tips and the workout is no more complex or challenging than walking in place."
3,OK,The video is pretty good. I have a couple others that give me a much better work out. It was inexpensive and I would buy again.
4,Great work out for all stages of pregnacy,You will use this video! I like it because it is low impact so I do it on the days I'm feeling tired too. It's a great all over work out that will make you feel refreshed and energized.
4,Easy but still effecctive,"I like the routine. First, you have to like Denise's way of teaching. She is very motivational and will be your ""personal trainer"" and get you to have a body ready for a bikini (all according to her multiple times during the routine). She is cute and energetic, but she could be annoying to some. You need to watch a clip of her before you buy a dvd. Also, I had placenta previa the end of my first trimester and some of my second. I have just begun working out again (27 weeks). This has been the perfect dvd to get me back into an excercise routine. Twenty minutes is the perfect amount of time when I am in a hurry, but I can do 2 routines if I have more time. I feel like I am doing something good but not killing myself. I have noticed more energy and my swelling has decreased in one week!!! I have other dvd's too. This was is great to have in the mix."
5,"Great, relaxing workout","This workout was super relaxing. I was used to a more intense workout, but this was perfect for the early morning. She makes sure you're very comfy for the floor work. I'd recommend it to anyone!"
2,"disappointed with Fit and Firm...,","I had high hopes for a workout that would be motivational to keep fit during my pregnancy, I am now in my second trimester, 4 months pregnant, I was originally working out to Wii Fit with Maya, and I loved it! really lost inches and felt toned and energetic, there are lots of different exercises to target different body zones and focus on other areas which allows for greater flexibility and move away from the boredom of working out with Maya. With Denise Austin, I was hoping for a bit of a challenge and also variety but after viewing the very first video workout, I really felt like I was working out to geriatric needs! I realized some moves are prohibited but I was not at all satisfied nor motivated to further continue Fit and Firm due to the monotony of the workout series. There are 3 workouts on her dvd which I didn't even bother with, I am back with Maya now just avoiding any moves that might be harmful"
4,I Like It!!,"I have several other Denise Austin dvds, so when I got pregnant I bought this one. She is very positive. The video has 5 different segments. I've watched them all, but I only do the cardio segment & the toning segment. The toning segment is really good. The cardio is a simpler version of her normal dvds. My one <minor> complaint is that when the video starts there is a logo that pops up 1st and the a legal warning/introduction which you cannot fast forward or skip over. Very annoying! I also wish that there was a 1st trimester workout segment that was a bit more challenging; the segments seem to be geared towards 2nd trimester (and later) & easier than what i'm used to."
2,My Wife didn't like it,My wife did not like this DVD. She said she found the lady in the video too talkative. There is a LOT of talking in it and not so much time dedicated to the actual exercises.
3,Great for days you're tired,"I did this for the first time yesterday. I did the 5 minute breathing and then the 20 minute cardio section. I am in my first trimester and I have been completly exhausted. Prior to my pregnancy I was very active and worked out 6 or 7 days a week. Since i've been pregnant I've had the typical first trimester, very tired and nauseous. I think the workout is good for a first time person being pregnant and who is very tired and has not worked out often. I can see how this video could be too easy for some people, however, it was just enough for me being so tired."
3,Annoying pregnancy video,"This video was okay as far as pregnancy workouts go, but I would recommend turning the volume down so that you don't have to listen to Denise Austin saying the same thing over and over again. It is not a strenuous workout in anyway so if you are looking for something to get your heart rate going this wouldn't be for you. If you are just looking for something to get you up and moving than this may be for you, just remember to play some music in the background to drown out her voice..."
4,Energizing workout for beginners,"It's hard enough to get into a fitness routine as a beginner but, add pregnancy to the mix and it's a whole new ballgame! This is a really great workout for the beginner and it's very energizing. Highly recommend this!"
4,Great work out,"I bought this video while about 7weeks pregnant. I had a very hard first 4 months that was riddled with pain, and sickness. So the hardes thing was to stay in shape. This video and it;s 3 work outs are very easy to do no matter how hard your pregnancy is. It got you moving and a steady enough pace to not over do it at all. I'd totally recommend it. I'm 6 months now and still using it a couple times a week."
2,Annoying,"To be honest, I found it annoying. Ms. Austin is way too perky for my tastes. And I would have preferred it if she was actually pregnant herself, because otherwise it just turns me off. The exercises themselves are just fine, I can get a good workout from them, but her personality spoils the workout."
4,loved it,This workout was great for me. I like Denise Austin's perkiness and she has models in each stage of pregnancy which are nice to see. The cardio workout is the best and the toning are not so good-I usually alternate the cardio on days I don't do Leisa Hart's fitmama salsa dance just to keep my cardio up and I do Pilates During Pregnancy or yoga for toning. The cardio section though has nice stretches and it's very safe for pregnancy and after doing it you'll wish she had included another cardio session on the dvd
4,Good DVD for exercise beginners,"I liked that this DVD had different workouts for different stages of pregnancy. Since I was a moderate exerciser before pregnancy with a background in dance, I found the routines a bit boring. This video would be good for a pregnant woman who has not exercised in a while or is a beginner."
4,Keeps you active!,"I have always been very active. I am an athlete and I run every day. When I got pregnant I got this video to keep up my activity level. I really enjoyed it! It isn't that hard, but it does get you moving. I don't think that this should be the only working out you do during your pregnancy, but it can definitely be a good addition. I walked a lot during my pregnancy, ate healthy foods (sometimes a lot of healthy foods!), and I did this workout video. I felt great throughout my pregnancy, had an easy labor and birth, and quickly lost my baby weight without having to go gung-ho with working out. I recommend this video if you are an active person, and want to have something safe to do on those rainy days!"
4,Solid,"This is a solid all-around cardio and strength workout DVD for pregnant women in any trimester, or post-partum. The format is easy to use, it gives you options to tailor your workout to your stage of pregnancy, and safety is stressed throughout. My only criticism is that Denise's boundless perkiness wears thin after a while. I fixed this by muting her and listening to my iPod instead once I was familiar with all the instructions."
5,Great Workout,"I loved this video- it made me feel very comfortable exercising knowing the moves were designed for pregnant women. Also, it was not too intense, which was great since pregnancy makes you so tired."
1,I hate this workout,"I really hate this workout. Its not challenging at all, and the instructer is way to perky and cheerful. I ended up buying a different workout, because even my husband couldn't stand listening to it while I worked out, and I couldn't get motivated to do the workout."
2,Waste of money,"I just did the twenty-minute workout and it was a joke. I'm not in the best of shape but it barely raised my heart rate and I made sure to follow all the directions and keep moving at all times. Denise Austin was also the most annoying fitness instructor I've ever heard...I can only listen to her say ""Enjoy it! It's a precious time!"" twice before I want to vomit.I wouldn't waste your time here."
2,Strange dialogue !,Denise's voice makes you want to turn the volume off and just watch the DVD and follow (WITHOUT SOUND) !!!
4,Definately recomend for pregnancy.,"It was so easy and clear to follow.Excellent instructions, simple as it should be, but effective exercises."
3,Caution,"This is a good video and very helpful. Bad: if you are overdue you should watch this to start your labor, if you are high risk don't buy this video."
1,Not for those in shape...,"If you worked out before pregnancy, you might want to consider another DVD.... It is incredibly easy and not at all challenging. I don't even break a sweat throughout the workout. Also, Denise Austin is incredibly cheesy in this video as she constantly reminds you, ""You're doing something good for you and your baby!!!"" Quite frankly, I want to punch her in the face every time she talks, perhaps it's the hormones talking (But I don't think so, judging by other reviews)! If you like cheerleader types, this might be a DVD for you."
5,Great easy to follow workout!,"I was very active before I became pregnant. (I'm in the US Army, so lots of running, push ups, situps, ect. Plus I did Karate and took a number of fitness classes at the gym) Although other reviews state that the workout is too easy, I think its just right. Perfect for beginners, although I will agree that more active women might look into doing additional exericses. I love that the moves are really broken down. I've done some at home dvds that say they are ""beginner"" but are way more advanced. Also I love that the cardio part doesn't require a lot of space. Again, i've done some where i've had to practically rearrange my whole downstairs just to get the room! lol. In short, I would totally recommend this dvd to any woman at any fitness level."
3,Good for the third trimester.,I would not buy this for working out in the first or second trimester. It is a bit wimpy and way too easy. However I will use it in the third trimester when its harder to move.
2,Waste of time and money,"Before pregnancy I wasn't super active, but I wasn't sedentary either- I worked out a few days a week for no more than an hour, so pretty average I think. This DVD wasn't a workout at ALL for me. I mean, seriously horrible. The only way I'd recommend it might be if you're beginning your pregnancy as a completely sedentary/obese person, because it does at least get you moving- which is so important when you're pregnant. If you want a good prenatal DVD, check out the one by Summer Sanders. It's awesome."
4,A little sticky...,"To clarify, right off the bat, I would have given the holster a 5 star rating but there is no adjustment screw for fit on this particular model. It's priced right though. The over all construction is the typical ""tank solid"" that you would expect from any militaria from Israel. The fit is good with my 1911. A bit tight, but the more I use it the better it seems to get. Basically if you looking for an entry level, well made holster, then this is the perfect choice. For a few dollars more however, you can get the ""Evolution"" series from Fobus. They are adjustable and look way cool. Great for the price."
4,Classic from the 70s,"Rare and rather obscure recording from New Zealand band Lutha.If you like Crosby Stills Nash & Young in their heyday of the late 60s into the early 70s then you will most certainly like this album.The music is progressive for the era, full of nice harmonies and great rock, with a touch of R&B; and country, jazz added to the mix. As is typical with all the good bands of the era, multiple songwriters, two lead singers and two guitarists made for a varied and strong recording.I'm so glad this came out on CD - second hand copies of the vinyl were going for crazy prices ($800 USD on eBay).Also look out for another good band from the era ""Highway"" - and if you're into Hendrix & Cream - ""Ticket's"" album 'Awake' is a must."
5,Love these,I do dog training and behavior work professionally and have found very few dogs that don't like these or can't have them due to allergies. Also they tear into smaller pieces easily.
2,Don't Hold Up,I bought these thinking they were leather shoes but they started to peel right away. My son found them comfortable but it wasn't long before they looked pretty shabby.
4,Great shoe,"This shoe was as it stated in the description. It arrived quickly and in great condition. The sizing however, may be on the small side so order the next size up from what you need."
4,boys loafers,These are great loafers for little boys at a good price. I looked around forever and these were the best quality loafer for the money.
5,Does what it's supposed to,"I had another program for my MS office files but after the formatting got blown away a few times I bought Documents To Go. I've never been let down by this product, it just works. When I bought my Tungsten I bought version 5.0 Premium because of the rebate and it's better than ever. They did a nice job with the word processor and added some other good (less used) features. I use this everyday and would be lost without it, I highlyrecommended it. It's a little pricey but the old saying is true, you get what you pay for."
2,"Nicely Free, but painfully slow and unfeatured",This software is included with many Sony and Palm devices (check your CD) but it is not best in class for the following reasons:- spreadsheet calculations are painfully slow.- wordprocessing capabilities are scant compared to other products like Wordsmith and QuickWord- Powerpoint solution scrambles the text so you can't tell how the info is really aligned on the slides- the Slideshow to Go doesn't let you present with the MARGI or iGo Pitch
4,Documents a GO!,"Being an Investment Professional, the Microsoft applications are a must. I am able to use this software to keep track of my clients on a real time basis. This software allows me to plan and edit my next moves for my clients as well as have detailed and professional presentations ready when I meet my Clients. Travel time is no longer a wasted time and I don't have to bring the notebook either. Excellent product."
3,sizes????,the sizes run small with these sweaters for some odd reason. order one size bigger. other then that great sweater.
5,"Lucid, brilliant, astoundingly original.","Lucid, brilliant, astoundingly original, May Sarton is a rare treasure among modern poets. A master of technical form, she never veers from the idea that poetry is for the revelation of individual insights gleaned from often painful experiences. Her uniqueness among the moderns lies in her understanding of the importance of the discipline imposed by traditional form as an instrument of clarity. She is among the very best."
1,"Obra buenísima, edición pésima","No hay *nada* extra--sólo el texto de la obra y una biografía de dos párrafos de Ana Caro. No hay notas de pie, no hay ningún contexto histórico, nada para ayudar al lector a acercarse al texto. Hay ediciones mejores que se puede encontrar gratis en el internet."
1,Misleading,"This DVD, one of which I recently bought from amazon.com, is not Loves and Adventures in the Life of Shakespeare, a silent movie made in 1914 or thereabouts. It is a documentary about Shakespeare, called The Life of Shakespeare, made by the Shakespeare Trust of Stratford-on-Avon in 2002. It does not contain any material from the silent movie, Loves and Adventures in the Life of Shakespeare, and nor does it star any of the people listed. Furthermore, it wasn't directed by J B McDowell. I am quite unhappy that I was mislead by a totally inaccurate description and would like to make sure anyone who wishes to buy this product realises that it is a modern documentary, albeit quite interesting and well done."
1,Read at your own risk!,"This book would better have been entitled ""Deviant Irish Women."" This is no children's book, as a quick glance at the graphic and gruesome illustrations prove. More horror than history, its stories of greedy, murderous women are not for readers interested in women and their roles in Irish history, but for those interested in gory, almost misogynistic stories about the most irredemable women Irish history has to offer."
1,Big disappointment,"I strongly recommend against this product. I bought it with the intention of transferring some of my DVD collection over to my new video iPod. I discovered after purchasing Roxio dVD Copy 2 Premier that it does not copy protected DVD's, which made 99% of my collection uncopyable. I'm not a pirate, I just don't want to pay for movies in the iPod format that I already own. With a little further research, I discovered that Roxio was the only product of its kind that does not copy protected DVD's. There's more. I found 2 DVD's in my large collection that were copyable, neither of which I really wanted to put on my iPod. Just the same, I tried to do so. I followed the directions carefully and waited literally hours for Roxio to copy the movies directly to my iPod. After both times, when I looked in the Movie directory of the iPod--they weren't there! Needless to say, I'll never buy another Roxio product."
5,Former caddie at Augusta National rates Ballard.,"As a former caddie at Augusta National, as well as other golf clubs in the U.S., I have seen a lot of golf swings. And yet, even after seeing so many, I have to say that there are basically only two types: good and bad. You can see the athleticism in a good swing, and it is beautiful to watch. Ballard's book is graceful like that; he can tell you what gives a swing ""grace."" As he explains and I can vouch for, a good swing results from economy of movement. That is why the book is so powerful: it focuses on a few keys to the swing. This reductionism has a psychological benefit as well: if you are not thinking about so many different ways in which the swing can go wrong, it's a lot easier to get it right. Not only that, but the book's style is equally as spare-but-powerfully-athletic as what Ballard has to say. Aside from the specifics of what he teaches, that is a rare thing to see in a golf book. Bob Jones might be impressed."
5,Makes the most sense,This instruction is the most direct approach and makes more practical sense then any of many many books that I have read. The method just simply WORKS.
5,"Clear, concise, excellent","Being in the sport of Judo for thirty years, I know a little bit about how the human body functions, the weak points and the strong. Jimmy Ballards efforts are right on the mark in explaining how the body's strengths can be maximized using clear and understandable terms. If I keep his 7 denominators in mind, my infamous slice disappears. His book was my best golf investment and I recommend it to anyone trying this maddening sport!"
5,Good book,"Biy it. This is an easy read and wise. It works. So obvious really. Hogan's book 5 Lessons has the ideas in it. This book shows you where to focus. Should be the first choice for any new aspiring golfer. Better than much of the garbage out there. I was in this direction anyway somthe book confirmed my feelings and swing changes. Golf is somewhat typical in that what you think might be right is not very useful. Any golfer can improve immediately by keeping the elbows close together, push them in at address, and keeping the right forearm vertical at the top of the backswing. Right palm faces up, elbow real close to hip pocket on downswing. That is it kinda."
5,PLEASED,"I wish that everyone that I have dealt with online and in stores were as fast as you guys, as pleasing to buy from, and give the services that you give. I have yet to look for something and you didn't have it. I will always do business with you guys and tell my friends about you. Again, Thank you."
3,Updated edition,"This book is a newer edition of the same publisher's book (same title) by Doris M. Smith, c1988. It has exactly the same stitches as before but book is much larger, schematics are much larger and easier to read, print is larger, and each chapter has a few projects (not in my earlier edition).Terms use American terminology. Stitches do not have descriptive titles only titled by number of multiples of stitches. No index. Illus in black and white, no colors. But for the price, certainly a useful addition to the crocheter's library of stitch collections."
2,Where's the Teddy Bear Square?????,"You can't judge a book by it's cover! That's for sure! When I saw the Teddy Bear Square on the COVER of this book, I decided to buy it. Well, I went all through the book, page by page and it is not there. That is fraud as far as I'm concerned.I thought perhaps there was a missing page, but NO! No missing page, just no Teddy Bear Square. I think this is very deceptive.How can I trust the rest of this book????"
4,Good Working Book for Every Crocheter,Some of the patterns are a little difficult to see in the black and white photographs; but the combination of International Crochet Symbols and written instructions for each stitch and pattern is excellent. Makes it very easy to understand and is a very good introduction to the use of the International Crochet Symbols. If you don't know these symbols then buy this book. Each chapter deals with a different stitch and then gives a pattern so you can practice that stitch. Some very nice patterns in it.
1,No way.,"The pictures in this book are horrible. Blurry in black and white. There's only simple stitches and nothing exciting. I have not used this book, and have had it for a few months now. I wasted my money :\"
5,Crochet emblellishments galore.,Great reference for stitches and block patterns. Easy to follow directions. One of my favorite crochet books so far.
3,"ahem,","It's printed on every other page only, the rest is page sized ornamented headlines. In the end there are some completely empty pages. I wonder why one would do that. They could have made a nice brochure of this.As for the content, it's nice, unoffensive, run-of-the-mill, nothing earth shattering."
4,Good overall information if you overlook the empire building,"This book has some good, basic advice. Dont eat processed foods with refined sugar, bleached flour, etc. However, you also have to take it with a grain of salt(Celtic sea salt? lol). It is very apparent to me that the author is building a supplement's empire as well. The message is: Eat what the maker intended and oh, by the way, you need my supplements as well. If you are eating a well-balanced diet, you shouldnt need many (if any) supplements. The recipes in the book dont always seem to back up the prior advice. For instance, we are told to strive for uncooked, natural foods, then the recipes indicate alot of cooking. We are told to eat natural ""caught"" fish, then recipes for canned tuna? You know how much processing goes on with canned meat!?Try to buy the book used for $5 and its worth a read."
3,Not bad.,"The nutrional value of this diet is sound enough. It would be good for all of us to eat orgainic foods. The author is really trying to push this one company's products, all which of which you can find at any helth food store if you do some looking. I bought some of the same products at walmart for a whole lot cheaper. I found the praying a little much. Prayer is great, but it won't heal Crohn's alone. Take what works for you from this book. Leave what you don't."
4,good but...,"leaving the fact that I have no religion or politics affiliations apart,Jordan's story is entretaining to read some of the facts that he express are valid but I found it a little exaggerated in many aspects, also it's obvious that he had made a really good bussines out of it, all the products that he recommends come from his online store and are quite pricey. But as I said, it's interesting to read..."
1,Not great,My problem with this book was that the author blamed his illness on the vaccinations he had received in high school. He went on a rant about vaccines causing autism which has been proven false. He also thinks that drinking florinated and clorinated water is bad. Had a hard time believing his diet since these fundamentals were wrong in his book.
3,"Some help, but...","The Maker's Diet is a good story of illness and recovery. But is it a good plan for lifelong health? Haven't seen medical proof other than the common sense approach to eating. While he never actually states it, I think Rubin is encouraging Kosher eating. I am 2/3 the way through the book, and the one thing that really bothers me is the shilling of products. C'mon, put the information there, or don't. Don't make me chase websites and other books and shell out more money just to hear more of your story. Be glad I bought your book! Hey, I'm glad I bought the book in that it has given me a rough guideline for which to construct a more healthy eating lifestyle. People may want to buy, but they don't want to be sold! And some of this book is all about selling."
1,Where's the scientific backing? The diet doesn't even start until after page 200!,"I thought I was getting a diet book & ordered it from my church's bookstore. I thought it would be based on Leviticus 11 & the instructions God gave for healthy eating. I've gotten to page 200, and all I've read about is how painful & disgusting GERD is and a bunch of lore about how the whole healthcare industry & vaccination shots are harming people. I've got an autistic son, so I've done tons of research on vaccinations & diets, and I've never seen such outrageous claims as this man has written. I'd be completely open to accepting what he wrote if there were any kind of citations or footnotes showing where science backs up his claims, but he quotes/ cites no such studies. The diet may be good, but I don't know since the book was such a complete disappointment that I quit reading at page 200... without even getting to the diet, still in his GERD saga."
3,excellent diet - but ...,"I'm grateful to have been given this book (it was a give-away at the Vitamin Shoppe), because it got me started using probiotics to heal my food allergies.However, I find it to be a rip off of other authors, in particular, Drs. Haas, authors of 'Management of Celiac Disease' (now out of print), Elaine Gottschall, author of 'Breaking the vicious Cycle' (which I HIGHLY recommend) and another book 'Paleolithic Diet'. It would be nice if Jordan Rubin gave credit where credit is due.And, as others have mentioned, it is one big advertisement for his over priced supplements. Which, by the way, why do you need if you're eating a healthy diet?Still, I gave him 3 stars because he does give some sound dietary advice."
2,Lame,"When reading this book I don't know if I'm reading the Bible or a diet book. The justifications for the diet just don't sound right to me. I need more scientific based conclusions as to why I should eat a certain food rather than ""God says it's ok"". It also sounds as if he hates pork, which seems to stem from religion also. I should have done more research before I bought this book."
5,Highly Recommend!,God Bless Jordan and his quest to educate our unhealthy ways. Just look around you as we get sicker and the pharmaceuticals get richer. His experience is living proof (that's enough scientific evidence for me) that God's way is the healing way to health.
1,do not use this as your own personal guide,"I actually found this book quite offensive.It assumes that you have a stay-at-home wife to support and cook for you all day.As a (female) sufferer of crohn's who lives alone, this was a highly impractical 'solution' for me. I manage a full time job so was not able to, for example, cook stock for two hours before even starting on whatever meal I had to make.I found my changes came to me by putting myself in a happier environment, becoming spiritual in the true sense of the word and eating an organic wholefood diet.Even if you are dying and desperate, there are much better things out there for you to try."
1,Disappointing,"Although it has a lot of good suggestions, I found this book disappointing. The author states that vegetarian and raw food diet is dangerous, sounds like someone who has never tried this diet and have never had anyone who tried this diet around him. If author does not have any experience, it is pointless to talk about it."
2,Interesting. But...,"The author's story is a truly inspiring and up lifting one. And as far as a translation of Judaic dietary laws into an approachable guide for modern Christians, this book is excellent. But it's just absolutely not pragmatic: financially, socially, or as far as natural cravings go. There's nothing wrong with enjoying modern culineary delights, so long as we don't over indulge. In my opinion, this author's view of food, though understandable because of his miraculous healing, is obsessive (because to follow the letter of this would require CONSTANT thought about meals), unrealistic (the financial constraints have been mentioned already), and rather judgmental towards those of us who feel no guilt in partaking of modern food in a reasonable fashion."
5,revolutionary diet,"I tried this diet for 40 days and I feel a lot better. I wasn't sick, just want to stay healthy."
4,The Maker's Diet,"'bought it used, but looks like new. I gave it to a friend whose husband has Crohn's disease and it gave him lots of encouragement. The diet, based on clean and unclean foods from the bible, is, I believe, a good idea for everyone, healthy or not. Probably the supplements recommended in the book are beneficial as well, but are impractical for me because of their high cost. Rubin was dying of Crohn's disease and had his mother photograph him wearing nothing but shorts to show his emaciated condition before his miraculous total recovery. He states that his positive attitude was a big factor in his recovery."
2,Amway on Steroids,"I am not knocking this diet. I am in fact trying to live it. I gave this book 2 stars because of its hipocrisy. This book will one day be given away free just to get you to buy the outrageously priced products. Before you buy this book just go to the author's web site. Its easy to find, just put a dot com at the end of the book's title. After you see what is there you are ready to make an informed decision. To run this diet right you will need at least $300 a month for supplements plus what it takes to eat organically."
3,Its OK for some.,I'm glad the diet work for Jordan. I get a lot of information emailed from him but dont see that it is relevant for me.
4,Good Purchase Experience,"The Makers Diet is showing itself to be a very helpful tool for what my Wife and I are desiring to do, where our health is concerned. I find it to be an easy read, with helpful advice as well as a plan of action and even recipes. The book was suggested to us by a friend; and we would definitely suggest it to others. Also, the product came in a timely manner, and in the condition stated. thx!"
1,From Rags to Riches - Using Bible to make $$$,"The author has no credible education. His degrees are worthless.The very fact that he is a Jew for Jesus tells you that he is one of those people who would do anthing to be popular. His book is an example of that. He found a huge nitch, the millions of religious folks who are looking to loose weight. Very few will follow his diet, but he will make money on the book and the sale of his supplements. Give the guy a credit - 1 star, for making big bucks while he was destined to be a low-paid peddler with no recognition. That's the real transformation!"
5,Great alternative to wheat pasta,"I purchased this product on-line hoping that I didn't have to return it. The taste is unexpectedly like that of wheat pasta, maybe even better. It goes well with tomato sauce and has a very light taste which doesn't leave you feeling bloated. Best of all, my finicky 9 and 12year old love it. They've told me they prefer it actually. This product is a great alternative for those of you who cannot consume gluten. Additionally, it presents well on a plate (without the sauce,)it has such a great color."
2,I did not like,"The package of 3.4 oz is not in the picture, the smell is not very good. I did not like the product. Delivery was fast and well packed."
5,Fast and Easy and way cheaper!,"Exactly what you expect, and its cheaper and if you get the online code its almost instant to put in and get playing... Ill never buy a Year of Xbox live in stores again. Thank you amazon."
5,Awesome. I got mine for less.,You can't be Amazon's deals. What an awesome place to buy from. I wish they where in my home town. Keep it up Amazon. You can't be beat.
5,VERY CONVENIENT!!!,Very satisfied with my purchase. It was very easy to get my online subscription without going to the store.
4,XBOX LIVE Great for NetFlix,"The only thing I use the XBOX LIVE for is for watching NetFlix movies on our big screen TV. I love NetFlix and being able to watch it through our Xbox 360. With the WII, however, you don't have to buy anything extra to watch NetFlix and I wish the Xbox was the same. If you haven't watched Prison Break on NetFlix, it is a great series. My whole family has enjoyed it."
2,kids havent got much use out of it....,"Even with this, the stuff they want they have to pay for so not impressed. have not used myself but dont see actually paying for it after trial expires."
5,Sweet,"Grab this if you need an easy for Xbox live without driving to your local store, buy it and type in the code and your connected instantly."
5,Simple easy and right back to gaming,"When my subscription for XBL ran out I went online looking for the cheapest place I could purchase a digital code and get back to gaming. This was simple and easy, got my code, renewed my subscription and it was cheaper than purchasing from Microsoft, what a deal!"
5,go and get xbox 360 12month live gold,go and get a 12 month live gold cardyou get espn and facebook and other stuffgo fun....!!!!!!!!
1,No funciono,Este prodcuto me dejo ingresar la clave en el xbox decia que estaba bloqueada perdi el dinero comprando este prodcuto con ustedes ademas nunca respondieron mis quejas adecuadamente ni me solucionaron el problema.
5,GREAT DEAL,"AWESOME DUDE GREAT PRICE ,,THE ONLY WAY TO GO ,SAVED ABOUT 20 DOLLARS OVER WALMART .I WOULD HOPE SO"
5,Better than buying one in a retail store.,"I decided to purchase one of these when my current subscription expired. It took a matter of minutes, and I was logged back on to my Live account. It was also about $10-12 cheaper than it would've been if I went to my local big box store (not to mention gas and time). Here are the steps that I took:1. Purchased it on Amazon.com2. Checked my e-mail to retrieve my Xbox Live Code immediately after purchase.3. Logged onto my account on xbox.com, and put the Xbox Live Code in. (Or enter the code on the Xbox 360 dashboard.)4. Turned on my 360 and viola! Instantaneous access.I plan on purchasing this again when my current subscription is up. It's a total no brainer."
5,12 Months For $45,"I saw this go down to $45 and I had to buy it. In comparison to the $60 XBOX would make you pay, this is definitely worth buying.Shipping was pretty slow, but can't argue. Thanks!"
5,Cheap,You have to have Xbox live. And its alot cheaper buying this code online then it is trying to buy it at the store.
5,Perfect Got What I Needed!!!!,Perfect!!!!! Got what I wanted for a great price!!! Enter the code and got what I needed!!! Highly recommend!!! A+++
5,xbox,As they get older it is nice that they can submit on Amazon a wishlist. This was one of my grandson's wishes. He called to say Hurrah I will have fun with this .
5,"works great, price sucks","Pretty much sums it up. Price is outrageous, but it works great and I love it. I hope that they lower the price soon."
5,Could not be more pleased!,"I wish all gifts were this simple. Immediately after making the purchase we received a code to input into the Xbox system. Our son input it, and his membership started. Instant gratification for us and for him. Best price too!"
5,Awesome but dont listen to J.Bland,"This is by far the best deal around that you can find for a 12 month xbox live gold card. However, please disregard the comments made by J. Bland. He said that you have to call xbox live support to cancel an automatic renewal process. He means that if you use a credit card then it is a huge hassle to not renew your live. This is completely and utterly false. All you need to do is go to [...] and use the e-mail address you used to create the account. From there, go to account management and you will see the option to cancel automatic renewal. i have done it before and it is not a hassle."
1,Why the price variance?,So... why the massive price difference between a mailed code (at extra cost) and an emailed code? The emailed code is $60 vs $43 to have the card mailed out. Crazy!
3,Good Product,I think it is too expensive unlike the ps3 and nintendo microsoft charges like 50 bucks for their product but it is still good.
3,alright,"The product serves just as it describes, but I would like it if it were way more cheaper being that playstation 3 doesn't require one."
5,Awesome!!!,This got in the second i placed my order. No wait at all. No issues activating the membership and no issues while playing on xbox live.
5,excelent,"Excellent, fast and trust worthy. Had no problems at all with this product, recommend to buy this thanks for a great service."
5,Great Buy,This is a great product and if you've been considering xbox live this is the best deal you will find on a twelve month gold membership! Great customer service and fast shipping!
4,Good bargain,Everybody knows what's XBOX Live.XBOX Live gives you a lot more fun than playing all alone.And this was a good bargain.I just hope that I can find another deal around Christmas time again.
4,Cheap 3 months of Fun,"This little card unlocks 3 months of premium content on Xbox Live.Useful if you aren't going to be around or using Xbox live for more than 3 months, but you can get a year for only $49.Highly Recommended."
5,"Good, and fast.","Its good, you get your code instantly when you buy it, you just have to click on a button to view it. Then just enter it on your xbox. Although, it says 1 bonus month, and I'm not sure i even got the extra month. All it said was a 3 month card when redeeming it."
5,Worked for me,This was a gift for my older brother. I was nervous about ordering this online with fear that it wouldn't work but it did. Guess I wasn't one of the unlucky ones ;)
1,En español,Compre la tarjeta y me fue mal pues nunca pude utilizarla el codigo no me sirvioXbox LIVE 3 Month Gold MembershipI bougth the product xbox live 3 month gold membership and I couldn`t use because the code was wrong
1,cant sign on with my email or password to use it,not good when you cant even use it when i try to sign on with my email or password cant sign on with xbox
1,Bulls***,"I just bought this and of course it doesn't work... I pressed to send the code to myself via email and after a half hour still haven't received it but did take a screen cap of the code so I could type it in right away...I keep getting a ""code not valid"" (this code can not be used for this offer. Please enter a valid code) message on the Xbox and there's no way to contact anyone at amazon seemingly to find out what is wrong with it...Thanks for nothing amazon... your customer service is exceptional..."
5,great savings,"Was convenient saved a bit a money,worth it. Using my card was not a problem.I will definitely be buying this again."
3,Best Price Around,"In order to access many features on Xbox 360 (online gaming, Netflix, Hulu Plus, other apps) you need to have an Xbox Live paid membership. While this is a pain (especially considering Playstation's membership is free), it is necessary to get full use of your Xbox 360. In our house, we use it for online gaming on the game networks as well as various apps: Netflix, Hulu Plus, Amazon Video, YouTube, and Pandora to name a few. Amazon has one of the best prices (if not the best price) on the memberships. There isn't a lot of difference in prices as I am sure Microsoft is probably pretty strict on what has to be charged. Amazon also makes it convenient by allowing you to have the code e-mailed to you instead of having to wait for a card to be mailed. This is a plus when you forget to renew your membership before it expires. Overall, a good buy if you have an Xbox, I just wish Microsoft wouldn't charge so much for the service (or charge at all)."
5,Great value.,"Order shipped same day, received 2nd day. Did my research on price and this was the best deal I could find at this time. The code worked as advertised. All is good."
5,Fastest & Easy,"My Xbox Live expired and I was about to go out and buy a new 12 month subscription card from Walmart, but decided to first check the internet for the best price. I found that Amazon had the best price and the Online Game Code was great because I didn't want to wait for it to be shipped. You recieve your code the second you purchase it and have the option to have it sent to your e-mail. It was fastest way to renewal, the code worked right away, and was the best price I would definitely purchase again."
5,Xbox 360 rocks,Xbox live Rocks and so does Xbox 360 and the best park is the code is online so no need to go to the store everything I need is here. Worht the cost.
3,Online code is usually $10 more than the physical card,"Amazon usually offers the best deal on XBox Live, but most of the time the online code costs $10 more than getting the physical card in the mail. That makes no sense since the online code is an auto-generated process with no postage, etc. If anything the online code should be $10 cheaper and NEVER cost more."
1,Not an instant game code,"This was supposed to be an online game code that gets sent to you as soon as you buy it. I needed it instantly to use with my friends and I got a message saying it would take 4 hours. Don't expect it right away, even though it should be instant."
1,a couple of years...,"...and we pay to microsoft another Xbox 360 with the use of ""Xbox LIVE Gold"".And this for a service that should be free or cost max $12.00 a year.Unfair."
1,WARNING: This is not the card in the image,"I ordered this as a Christmas gift, and received a piece of paper with some code on it. No instructions, no card as shown in the image. I feel totally ripped off. Not only do I not know if this will work, it looks horrible as a gift - as though no one cares."
5,X bos gold card,Received card. Was easy to set up and activate. Was way cheaper buying it here than at Gamestop.Son loves being able to play with his friends online. (Even though playstation 3 is free) it was a good purchase.
5,satisfied,"I was hesitant to buy this, but happy that I did. It loaded with no problems and shipped in about a week."
5,"Online Purchase, Simple, Straightforward","I purchased a 12-month Xbox 360 live card through Amazon's ""online"" delivery. Once the order completes, the code is displayed for you on the web page with the option to send it to an email address of your choice (presumably for gifting). The code gets typed in on the console and within a few minutes your gold membership is extended. The whole process was painless and quick.I've heard the usual complaints about being unable to do a ""one-time"" charge for an Xbox membership extension. They keep it on record and automatically renew your account when it expires. The prepay essentially avoids that, and can get you a discounted price in some cases. Normal price is usually around $40-$50, but it does fluctuate with occasional sales to bring it down by $5-$10."
4,XBox 3 month membership is good deal!,"worked like a charm, great interaction! Needed something to get my daughter online with me so we could play with some friends online...next time I'll be getting the year membership if she's all for it."
4,XBL - A good deal,"What more can I say? Its a 12 month Xbox Live Gold Membership for $39.99, which is $20 buck less than the $60 dollars per year subscription cost.I feel that $60 per year/$5 per month for Xbox Live is a great bang for the buck for such a good service & at $39.99 its even sweeter."
5,Cheaper than retail stores or through xbox,"I bout this when it was on sale for thirty something dollars. I always find it cheaper than buying it at Target, Walmart, and off of the Xbox 360 itself. So I'll continue with buying it off Amazon for that reason."
5,Couldnt beat the price,"When I purchased the year card it was priced @ $34.99, I would have been stupid not to purchase it at that price."
5,Very Nice! Very Nice!,I always enjoy having Xbox Live Gold membership so when Amazon gave me a huge discount on a 12 month card I jumped at the chance to purchase it. Amazon is the cheapest link to getting Xbox Live Gold Cards I've found yet.
5,good price!,"when i bought this, i bought it for $20 saving $5. it was a present for my brother and he loves his x-box. i had a hard time finding good deals on these cards and amazon is the only way to do it from now on!"
5,WORTH GETTING,XBOX LIVE makes gaming the most fun experience ever. You can play with friends and it is a neccesity if you have Call of Duty or Battlefield or any shooter.
5,Keep watching for deals on this membership!,"Although it pains me to have to purchase a membership every year, Amazon has the best prices it seems, and offers deals pretty regularly, so keep an eye out. Everyone knows what there is to know about the product, so I will instead stress that you do not have to buy this product at retail."
5,xbox 360 3-month gold membership download,"Product works good, no hiccups. Only complaint download was not available for several hours. I was not able to complete or access the download file until the next day."
5,Easy and reasonable,Ordering the Xbox LIVE 3 Month Gold Membership from Amazon was both easy and economical. Amazon's price for the 3 month membership card was better than Xbox's price. The time it took to order the card and then apply the online game code was less than 10 minutes. I will definately continue to use Amazon for my Xbox Gold Membership purchases.
5,Cheap,"I recently decided to get Xbox Live and this is the cheapest I've seen the card. If you're going to use Live, buy the card from here. It saves you some money."
5,Xbox Live 12 month subscription,Great deal for an immediate online code. Didnt have to waste time or fuel going to the store for one of these and saved even more compared to store prices and Microsoft themselves. I would buy this again and will and have told others.
5,Best price on the internet,Who would pay 60 bucks for Xbox live? 45 is much more reasonable.Using the online game code gives you access to the code instantly so its good in a pinch also.Sometimes this is actually more expensive than ordering the physical card here on Amazon and having it shipped to you so definitely check into that before you purchase if you want to save 6 pr 7 bucks. When I just purchased this it was the same price so I figured I might as well go with the electronic version.
4,Very convenient,One of the best ways to purchase a membership. I bought this as a gift for my brother and all I had to do was email him the codes...Bazinga!
5,the way to go,"Buying xbox live from amazon is definitely the way to go. It is easy and cheap. All you have to do is buy it and then 10 seconds later you get a code, type it in, and boom....xbox live."
5,12 Months of the Best Online Gaming...,"I've been an Xbox LIVE! member for years now.Really, the only way to do it is with the 12 month cards. It's so much easier than buying three month cards or anything else, and on Amazon it's actually cheaper than even Microsoft sells it for directly.Do yourself a favor, save some cash, and get this card to continue your account."
3,XBox Live,"Overall, the value of the XBox Live is pretty handy.We use our 360 for a PVR extender from our windows 7 HTPC.It extends Netflix & Pandora additionally into our bedroom.All in all, handy!"
5,would get membership this way again,"Getting the code through Amazon was a very easy way to buy Xbox gold membership. Just entered it online instead of having to deal with the on-screen keyboard, and it was a piece of cake. I was also glad to be able to avoid having my credit card used to automatically renew it after a year."
5,GREAT.,it went through very smoothly without giving me any problems at all and making me enjoy every part of the process.
5,Great Service being a PS3/360 owner but one gripe.,"XBL is great In my opinon I enjoy PSN and XBL but the main 2 things i like live better is A. 360s netflix service its the best implemented out of the other systems and party chat great way to chat with a group of your friends.Now my one Gripe is the price on this i Love its the cheapest here but i would think Amazon would be a lil more Green friendly and be making the email codes cheaper than the full gift cards as its extra cardboard, plastic, and money to waist on such a small thing, but anywhoo get your live card from amazon you wont regret it."
5,gift for spouse,My husband really likes this for gaming with friends who live far away. Shipping went well and price was the best.
5,XBOX Live,"We buy this so we can stream video, browse the Internet, and play games online. We like the service and would recommend it."
3,ok,Its a code that give you a membership so you can wast away you life playing video games just like me
5,Mint.,"Worked perfect, glad to be up and running right away and for the price, I don't think you can beat it."
4,xbox,"great fun to play with the xbox........nice to have a membership for a year. The value was good, received timely"
5,Code works,"I love xbox live and Amazong is always the cheapest way to find these codes. Most places will let you download the code instantly upon purchase, which I like. All codes are valid."
5,Thanks Amazon for Saving Me $168 on Xbox Live Fees!,"I have 2 boys and normally pay $10 per month for Xbox Live, this deal just saved me $168 for the year.The process was fast and painless.. I got my codes immediately after I paid. A+"
2,gift card ORDER,"Ok, playing online for xbox is very fun. of course,you have to pay for xbox live gold. xbox live is pretty boring with a silver account, so gold is the way. i was pretty excited ordering this because it is my first time having my own gold account. since i chose email delivery, i expected it to be at my email by, at the most,about 8 o'clock. it is now the next morning at 10:17 and it said it just finished processing. The only bad thing is that it takes so long to get the code."
5,Don't buy it from Amazon. Slow shipping,"Ordered this because Newegg.com was sold out. I chose 2 day shipping with my free trial of Amazon Prime. Took Amazon 4 business days to ship which is unacceptable. This is understandable with super saver shipping, but the free 2-day shipping is a joke. Amazon is definitely the place I WON'T be buying this next year.Pros: Great deal. about $20 cheaper than MicrosoftCons: Slow shipping, even with 2-day Amazon Prime trial membership"
5,Great price if you wait for it to drop!,"This is usually how we buy the X-Box Live card. I wait until Amazon has dropped the price of the 12 month card to under $45 and buy with the online game code option so I can load it on immediately. It's easier, safer and saves some cash."
5,Great buy,"Purchasing a 12 month gold subscription to xbox live opens up a whole new world of opportunities to play with friends around the nation. I am no longer in college, but I can still play against my friends from school via xbox live. The best part about purchasing this item from amazon.com is that you save yourself an extra $10 off the normal price. Great buy!"
5,12 month Gold Card Subscriotion,"Felt like this could have come faster, but it worked. And was cheaper than ordering it from Microsoft. Even better now that they raised the prices."
5,It's xbox live,"Everything you expect Xbox live to be. So, it's perfect. Allows you to do whatever you want on your xbox"
2,Dont buy the card! Just get the game code!,I wasted a lot of time waiting for the card to come in the mail. Now Amazon has a site where you can purchase JUST the game code! Do that and save time and money!
3,Problem with purchasing code,"Amazon would NOT allow me to purchase this online game code using an Amazon Gift Card. I called customer service, and they said that there is no way around this. Apparently since it's an online item, instead of an actual item that has to be shipped to address, they require a credit card to confirm that the buyer is authorized to use the Amazon account. I thought that's why they had sign-in names and passwords? Apparently those are useless. Since I don't have a credit card, I guess I won't be able to buy this, which makes me very sad for the holidays."
3,Xbox Live,There are tons of things you can do with Xbox Live from watching movies to playing games with friends. I wish they would be more like Playstation Plus and offer free games and more discounts.
5,Easy as 123,Got the code sent to my email address very easy to use and put the code in and started my year membership
4,Excellent and easy to install,I wanted a purchase membership code for my son but was not sure how it would work. To be on the safe side i decided to purchase the 3 moth Gold instead of the 12 months in case it did not work but it work perfectly.The instruction was clear therefore once i followed the instruction on how to enter the code it worked instantly. Our three months is not up as yet and my son has no complaint and cant wait to purchase another one.
5,Xbox Live Forever !!,If you are a n Xbox User..There is no way you can NOT Have the Xbos Live Gold activation..Is good for almost an unlimited opportunity for bargains and connectivity to the Xbos community....
5,Pre-Paid is Sooo Much Cheaper,Buy the pre-paid card its much cheaper than auto renewal. I found out as I paid with a CC through xbox for my son it was on sale and still $49.99 last year. Well what I did not catch is xbox (msft) turns on auto renewal so this year in early March I get a bill for xbox live for $63.99!!! I promptly turned off auto renewal but still stuck with this outrageous bill when I could get the prepaid card so much cheaper.
5,Great deal!!!,Was very happy to get this for my son. I'll get it myself to renew my Gold membership when I save up for it.
5,"excellent, didn't even know this was available this way",I expired on my gold membership in the middle of the night but I still wanted to play. I looked this up on amazon and there was a downloadable code right there for less then I can get a 3 month subscription anywhere.. Great product
3,Xbox Entertainment,"Initially purchased Xbox live Gold membership for my teenage son. However turns out the whole house benefits. It was more affordable than purchasing month to month. It was easy to load up. I find my self using Xbox for the other perks; netflix, music, internet and so on. Overall my son said it was a good deal. Although he feels microsoft points is expensive for what they offer, in connection to playing Xbox games."
1,Gave me a Used Code,"Ordered it on the 12th. Tried to put the code in today on the 17th. Didn't work, told me to put in a Valid Code.Don't waste your money with Amazon on this."
5,Worked as expected,Didn't have a problem with the code and lasted as expected. Went ahead and purchased the full year membership card and also working well.
5,Xbox live beats all,"It's the best gaming service there is with additional features like hulu netflix and more, of course many of these thing require an additional fee, but xbox does it best, that's the only reason I'm a five year subscriber"
5,Xbox Live 12-month Gold Subscription Code,"Like many others, I didn't realize my Xbox Live subscription was about to end and found out the hard way. Since I refuse to pay Micro$oft's price for a subscription, I went straight to Amazon. Am I glad I did! They have a new option to get a code upon purchase so you don't have to wait for the card in the mail. Awesome! I will never have to worry about my subscription running out again. Thanks Amazon!"
5,cheap and quick,Cheaper than buying it at a store and I didn't have to leave my couch. There really is no reason to go get a piece of plastic that you're gonna throw away.
5,Excellent Product that works in Minutes,"Within minutes of ordering this item, I received the ""code"" which I entered into my Xbox live account and began gaming again. This is a great alternative to reviewing a hard product by mail. Two thumbs up!Regards,Diciples of Gaming (DoG) member"
5,Great,"Thought that I already rated this, happy to save a few bucks and it loaded without any issues. Thanks for the discount"
5,great value,Great value. I ordered this for my nephew two years in a row for Christmas. He loves it. Easiest gift I've ever bought.
5,you get what you pay for,"I was please to get this for 10 dollars under what Microsoft was asking directly through Xbox live, this will be my method of renewing from now on."
3,Be prepared for rude customer service,When I did not receive the code to download this when I purchased it I called in to fin out what was going on. I was met with the rudest customer service. They said if I wanted it faster I shouldn't have purchased it from amazon. That it takes time to get the code to a customer if you do business through amazon. But it was not Amazon that the problem laid. It almost seemed like the customer service team wanted to punish you for not purchasing from them directly. They actually told me that if I cancelled my amazon purchase and purchased from them directly and paid a little more they would give me my code immediately. I said I would wait the 24 hours then to do business with such rude dishonest people.
5,once again...,Grandson wanted it I bought it--- greatest value on the internet and or in stores.Good value for the money!!!!
3,xBox live,I love being able to get online with my Xbox. I find it completely ridiculous that I have to pay to use the wifi I already pay for. But this is nice how the game code instantly goes to my email. Very convenient
5,Worked like a champ.,"Input the code, the code worked. Boom goes the dynamite.Ten more words required? Six, five, four, three, two, one."
5,"GET LIVE FROM AMAZON, EVERY TIME!","If you don't like Microsoft holding your credit card number, and potentially renewing Gold when you don't want to, this is for you. You get the code instantly, and Live codes here at Amazon are always cheaper than that of Microsoft's Marketplace. Highly recommended!"
5,Great?,What can you really say? This game code allowed me to log into Xbox live and play my favorite multiplayer games. It also gives me the ability to use my favorite media apps. The Xbox has transformed into an all around entertainment machine and I feel that Microsoft continually adds value to the console. It makes it worth having to pay for monthly/yearly subscriptions. (People may disagree but ask about their experience with PS3 and Wii's online experience. Many will agree that it doesn't compare to Xbox)
5,Great entertainment,"My son uses the membership for his online games and netflix. Installed with no problems. Of cource parental guidance still needed to ""police"" the frequency of use."
4,XBOX!!,This is by far the cheapest xbox live membership around. They make great gifts for kids of all ages. SWEET!
3,over exaggerated,"i go onto my xbox and it tells me to go to amazon.com for a 33%off on a year subscription to xbox live, and wen i get there n check it out i see only a 21% discount... yes thank you, but if ur not going to give what you advertise then do us all a favor and dont advertise..."
2,Wouldn't work,Bought this for my grandson's birthday and when he entered the code he got some kind of error message. He will be calling microsoft to figure out the problem. Not the kind of thing you want for a birthday gift.
4,XboX 3-months Gold,"Personally i would get the 12+1 months gold membership for the best deal, but focusing in school is a major problem when you have a year membership. so i decide to buy a 3 month to play in the summer and that works pretty well, i bought mine on amazon since is cheaper and i got free shipping. I gave it a 3 stars because it could've been cheaper, but overall is worth the price if you don't want to buy a whole year of membership and doesn't have time to play the whole year."
5,"On time, it worked",Perfect. It was on time and worked best price for an Xbox 12 month I have ever seen on the web
4,I guess it's ok...,I got it for my son to play his 360 live. I haven't seen him since - I guess he's digging it.
5,Xbox Live 12 Month Game Code,First time I ordered a game code online. I figured if it didn't work I would be out of luck but since it was from Amazon I ordered it. Received the code instantly and installed it with no problems. I will order it again when this one expires.
5,Xbox live gold card...A+,This is the best value around for the xbox 12 month gold card. Took about a week or less to arrive in mail. No problems with card or purchase. A+!
5,XBL 1 Year Gold Card,"I took a risk, having a feeling that for the price I'd be getting a used card or an nonactivated card. Nope! It was a new card with an activated code in the same tough to open plastic packaging."
4,Does what it says it does...,Bang for your buck. 12 months of Xbox Live available at your disposal in this convenient disposable package. As far I am concerned this product if far better than using your credit card to pay monthly on your Xbox console. It includes step by step directions on what you need to do and the best part is you can use it at your leisure. Overall a great product.
3,Wish it was cheaper.,"Xbox Live is awesome. I just wish that they would lower the price but you know what they say, you get what you pay for."
5,Happy,really happy with the purchase. I have a lot of fun playing xbox live. also got the code in less than a minute.
2,Gold is a ripp off,"I bought this and I regret it, what is the point of Gold subscription, to watch netflix, and Lebrons family TV show? I wish I had bought PS Plus instead - go Japan! btw Windows 8 is awful!"
3,Hmmm,How do you rate a Xbox membership card? If you like an Xbox then why wouldn't you want to pay for online gaming if that's your thing. Only gripe could be is the price which should be practically free considering the cost of the systems and then the games!
2,code didnt work,was on phone with Microsoft rep for 40 min.finall got it resoved| 7 more words required| 7 more words required
3,works and cheaper then the mircosoft store,"it beats paying the extra money when you order on your xbox, but if you live in AZ they are charging sales tax now which really sucks and was a big reason i liked shopping on amazon"
3,Hype Card,"I bought this to find out what all the hype was about. I was surprised that people are willing to pay to access services that are FREE on the PS3 (netflix, vudu, amazon prime, etc.). This card enables you to access these entertainment apps, but you still need to pay for the services those apps provide. The interface is a bit more user friendly than the PS3 interface, but it is not worth the $."
2,Not user friendly,Not the deal I wanted all I wanted to do was save. It's a gimmic to make you pay for something should be free.
5,I love it,Very good price.I was pleasently supprised that it comes with key board for the Xbox controller and headphones. I love it.
5,Good value,I have always bought my Xbox live member cards from Amazon. The shipping is fast and the price is usually better than getting it through the Xbox.
4,Love live,I love how my husband and his brother are able to talk to each other via xbox. They live on opposite sides of the country and now talk to each other several times a week opposed to a couple times a year. I would like it to be cheaper. But what can you do. My kids and I use the Xbox live to watch netflix. Which altogether is pretty sweet.
5,My Son love it,"Easy to set up. Received on time, and price is good. My son enjoying and worth the Gold membership. Too much money charging by microsoft."
5,Quick and Easy.,Came quickly in the mail. It was easy to find and input the code and it is a deal compared to buying monthly or semi-annually.
5,XBL 12-month Gold Subscription,Gold Subscription has all the perks that any gamer needs to play online. A great buy!!
1,failed to activate,The code failed to activate. Called the XBOX customer service and was asked to wait for 3-4 days. After 3-4 days no progress. Told to wait another 7 days. Haven't seen such poor service anywhere else.
1,This is redic.,"so, I bought the product, and it didnt go through right away, SO I read some of the reviews, and they talked about non working codes, so I called customer support, and he refused to refund my money, even though it says that they can.. Needless to say, I will be going through xbox itself, never mind the 5$ of saving.."
3,XBOX LIVE GOLD MEMBERSHIP REVIEW.,I BROUGHT THIS FOR MY SON AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT. SINCE HE LOVES PLAYING VIDEO GAMES. SO I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT. BUT HE KNOWS ALOT ABOUT THESE MEMBERSHIPS. SO I WOULD SAY IT IS A GOOD BUY.
5,Best Membership Card,"Can't complain about the membership. It's a must have for Xbox users, and I'm really enjoying my Xbox Live membership!"
3,dfsdf,It took forever to figure out how to apply it....not very good instructions for someone using for the first time...
2,X-Box Live Card,"Was really disappointed when I found this way cheaper on another site, (only difference was no card, still get the code to use it) So I guess next time I'll have to look around more!"
3,"An OK deal. (Not great, not bad.)","A 12 month membership for $40 is alright, and a much better deal than on Microsoft's own website, but there are always deals and specials going on elsewhere where you can get a membership for $5-10 less, or free bundled with some games.I would tentatively recommend, but only if have no patience for looking around the internet for deals."
5,Why am I still paying for xbox live,"Good deal, but I still don't know why we have to pay for online service when we pay for everything else associated with our xbox. It's time for Microsoft to take a chapter out of Sony's book when it comes to online services. FREE ONLINE PLAY!!!"
4,"Great, but not so great","When I ordered this, it took about a second to appear. The only one problem I have is that they don't email you the code. The code is there for you when you purchase it. Supposedly you were to press the refresh button by mistake. That's a twenty down the drain, unless you would take the time to complain. This is great, but could be better!!!"
3,Cool,If you want to save money just get the year membership because this product is making u pay like 7 bucks for a month wich sucks compared to the year membership.
5,Fast and Easy,Purchased these Microsoft points and within a few minuets received the code via my e-mail and was playing the new map pack I wanted without a hitch.
5,Adds on to existing membership,Just purchased the online code with the $25 discount for ordering Modern Warfare 3. My son's account was good until 9/2012 and this added on to that an additional year to 9/2013. Can't beat $35 so this is a good deal and very easy to do. Would recommend anyone who ordered MW3 to take advantage of the $25 discount...
3,You know what you're getting,"If you've an xbox 360 without xbox live you might as well just own an original xbox. You know what you're getting if you purchase this membership, access to all the streaming content from the apps you can download as well as internet explorer on your tv and of course online gaming for your games. Should it be free like ever other streaming box out there once you pay for it (not to mention like its main competitor the PS3.) But Microsoft loves to nickel and dime you and this membership gets you that stuff you really bought the xbox for, so a necessary buy.Two stars off because this product shouldn't exist. 3 stars because I don't have to get off the couch to get a membership."
4,Though Annoying To Have To Pay To Play Online Still Was Reasonable For A Year Subscription,"While it's always going to be annoying having to spend money on anything,for $40.00 dollars for a year subscription on Xbox Live I can learn to live with that. Also it's helpful and convenient to be able to get the code online after purchasing the card instead of having to a gamestore and but the card there. Once you punch in the redeem code you good to go, again while a little annoying for $40.00 dollars for a year of XBL I guess its' an affordable price for any Xbox 360 gamer."
5,Xbox live,i got this year live card for only 30 dollars! dont buy this full price like at a walmart or target or some store like that buy this at amazon.
5,Xbox Live Code.,"Todo perfecto, este metodo es muy rapido y el codigo funciona sin problemas. Ademas es mas economico que comprarlas directamente por xbox live."
4,LIVE,This is an XBOX Live Membership. Haven't acctivated it yet but am upset that I paid $63.00 when you can go to any store and buy it for $50.00 plus tax. I was duped for convience.
4,Peggy's XBox review,"I bought this for my son. I love the low, reasonable price. I also like that it was delivered within the time frame that was quoted. No surprises. My son had no problems entering or downloading the code, and has had no problems so far with the service. Thank you!"
5,it works,You save ten bucks as opposed buying it directly from Microsoft. The choose i bought works. I don't know if there's much more to be said than that.
5,Save money and buy this for your annual renewal,You can buy this and use it when it is time for your annual renewal on Xbox live. This saves you abut $10 from if you were to renew (automatically or otherwise) on xbox live. All you have to do is logon to your xbox live account and redeem the code you purchase on Amazon. This will extend your membership.
2,call xbox customer service,"Its cheaper than buying it at wal-mart,but the real trick is calling up xbox customer service and politely asking them if they are running their 34.99 .....12 moths subscription and if so can you renew next year at the same price and write it in your xbox360 profile for you."
3,XBOX Live,So I have had a PS3 for the last 4 years and I just recently got a Xbox 360. I got online because I am a fan of the online play. I really like that you can listen to music while playing a game. But I haven't seen a lot benefits that makes it worth the money compared to PSN for free. If you need xbox live this is the way to go. It is ten dollars cheaper on amazon with the code then from microsoft so get it from Amazon.
1,Keep in mind,this is from microsoft. expect to have wait 20 minutes or so for required updates and patches to downlaoad and install when you really want to use it
1,Not telling you everything,"Dont think when you purchase this card thats all your purchasing. I purchased this card towards the end of August 2012. All seemed normal and fine with the deal. Then my wife shows me that Amazon Digital has been still charging our account $9.99 a month after our original purchase. Their explanation was that when we made the purchase we entered a subscription service. When I asked where was this subscription service anywhere in the product description, they couldnt answer it. I would recommend away from purchasing anything from this seller."
1,Not Instant!,Was supposed to be an online game code so that I could play instantly without running to the store or waiting for it to be mailed. Amazon lags the processing for payment verification purposes and it can take up to 4 hours. This isn't stated in the product details. This is supposedly to prevent rampant fraud on such orders but I want to play now!
1,Well I'm sure if it worked.....,"Well if the code they sent me even worked, that would be cool. First time this has happened to me from amazon. Now I have to wait 7 days just for a replacement. Or whatever. Well I guess next time I'll go to eb or something."
2,Not as advertised,"How do you review a product like this? It either is what it says, or it isn't. In my case, it wasn't. It was advertised as a 12 month +1 card. When I activated it, I only got a 12 month subscription and there was no information anywhere on how to get the bonus month. Be warned."
5,Best possible price by far anywhere!!,I am very pleased to say that while not everything on Amazon is the cheapest. It's always worth while to check various prices. This is a HUGE find! It was one of those purchases that I thought was too good to be true. But it turned out to be everything I needed. One more year of good times of online fun!!Thank you Amazon!Jim
5,I love it,"Great for watchign Netflix, ESPN downloadign game demos and playign online games. Much better than the free PSN - Sorry PS3 owners."
3,Fast and easy,"Over payed, but it was fast and there when I needed it. eight more words, here you go, okay done."
1,over rated,when you switch to the 360 live you have to pay more money to do so. just buy the 360 card and have no problems like i did.
1,"Online gameplay is fun, but ads!?!?","There are now advertisements to all people who bought an Xbox LIVE Gold card with their hard-earned cash, yet the high price for the subscription is still the same, if not higher. If you would like to block these horribly annoying ads, fear not! Go to [...] and follow the steps on there. Blocking rad.msn.com will only block half of the ads. Look in the comments to find the other sites you may block to entirely eliminate ads from your console."
1,Live purchase only with US Billing Card,"I don't understand why Microsoft being an international company, would only accept cards billed in the US. I am currently out of the country and will be back perhaps in 5 years. I have to go to the hassle of bothering someone in the States just to purchase a dam card when I should be able to use my international visa card. This is definitely STUPID"
1,Complete Waste,Why pay to play online when XBox competitor PS3 is for free? Stop spending $59.99 a year and save it for a PS3 game yearly. You'll thank yourself for it in the long run.
1,it didn't work because of different region for my Xbox live account,"it didn't work because of different region for my Xbox live account, after i try to read the code from the xbox dash board its give me error."
5,Simple to use,"Purchased the Xbox Live Membership via Amazon, got the code, and added it to my Xbox Account. It was a whopping 5 minute process, very pleased."
5,Cheaper,I found this to be a lot cheaper then going to the store. I can usually find at Ebay cheap also. But without having to bid I still got a good deal on the XBOX 360 membership even though I hate the fact you have to pay to go online and play when on PS3 you don't.
1,Not a game - rather game time online.,"I used the card the day I received it hoping to bypass my credit card deduction. There were problems with the server when I tried to redeem my code. I re-entered the code a few days dater, received an error, ""This code has already been activated."" Yet I had no addition to my Xbox live account. Now my Xbox Live account is denied.I don't know who to blame because neither Microsoft nor Amazon have anything answering their phones execpt for robots who aren't equipped to help me.On top of this, I know my post will require my credit card info or mailing address, so the two companies that failed me can both email me and send me junk mail in the post."
4,Instant XBox Live,"These online game codes allow for purchase of XBox Live Gold from home without having to share my credit card information with Microsoft. I have used these in the past and never had a problem with them. Once you recieve the online code, all you have to do is imput it into your ""Redeem Code"" section on the XBox Live marketplace. DO NOT loose the code. Have Amazon email it to you as well as writing it down. Enjoy."
5,Lets play,This is Funny and good for the peoples that are playing in XBOX life.Not expensive. Easy access. Thank you Amazon.I will recommended.
4,"Received code instantly; however,...","I bought the online code and received it instantly upon purchase. However, it took about 5 minutes for my Xbox to accept the code. It kept saying it was an invalid code. Luckily I was persistent and kept trying it while looking up how to contact amazon about it. It eventually accepted, and I was so relieved!"
5,ONLINE GAME CODE ROCKS!,"Dont give microsoft your CC info as there has been ""issues"" with them not canceling your account when you ask, just buy your prepaid code from Amazon!"
5,Another pleased customer,"I was very pleased with this transaction, its an online code so it comes instantaneously and you can use it immediately on your xbox. It also saved me a bit vs. buying it from the retailer or store."
5,Great Price!!!,Bought this for $35! That is the best price I've seen for this card. Usually I have to pay $60 . Thanks Amazon!
5,live 3 month online code,Works great. I get the code right after I pay and It works no problem. Save a couple bucks rather than going to the store.
4,"Great Price, slow process.",I cant believe i got this xbox live membership for $20 LESS!!! I am so grateful for Amazon selling this membership for such an affordable price and it saves me $20 for i can buy something else :DThe bad thing is the Amazon servers took too long to process the payment and deliver my xbox live membership code through my e-mail. The maximum time they said was 4 hours. I cant wait that long for i can be able to play with some friends. Hopwfully they fix this problem and have the codes e-mailed directly to their e-mail as soon as the buyer confirms the purchase. Thanks Amazon
5,a nice gift for my brother,"My brother just got a xbox 360, and I got this as a gift. this is a good option , Like a boss"
5,Awesome price!!!,You will never find a better price in town unless it was given to you as a gift. I plan on getting another one so that my other son can have his own 12 month gold membership. I garrantee you will not find it any cheaper ANYWHERE!!!
5,Best deal you will find....,"12 months for 35 bucks!! Now i'm no mathmatician (i don't even think i spelled it right), but i think its less than 3 dollars a month. What a deal!"
5,cheap and great instant code,Quick and easy. And I saved 20 bux not too mention the tax from going to walmart. I bought the online code and seconds later I was on xbox live.
5,MUST HAVE FOR ANY 360!,Amazon is cheaper than most regular stores and online through Microsoft. It is important to add this is for one account not every account on the Xbox so a family with multiple players will need multiple cards.
5,Great deal!,I got this when it was an Amazon deal of the day and it made it so I was only paying $3 a month vs 10 a month with a subscription!
2,Download Code Vs. Shipped,"So having this emailed to you cost more than them to ship it? That is plain stupid, they should make the email one cheaper because they dont even waste money on shipping"
5,Xbox Rocks!,"At over 30% off the price you would pay at Best Buy or to Microsoft with your annual renewal, this is an awesome deal!!!"
3,Beware,xbox is great with kinect but the apps are not all free hula plus and a few more you need to pay to view
4,Microsoft Points,Amazon sells xbox live points=instant gratification without giving your credit card number to microsoft to float around online. This is the best way besides ebay to buy these points. If the price was lower it would be a even better.
5,A bit pricey but cheaper than anywhere else!,"So I looked around before purchasing and found that amazon had the greatest price. The item comes in a small box and in my opinion not necessary, the card should just be placed in a packaging envelope. Though this is great if you play online games or watch Netflix. I'd definably tell anyone buying a subscription to get it from here."
5,xbox live prepaid,"just got my prepaid card via ups today! i didn't do the online code because it was almost as much as going to a local brick and mortar store and just buying a card. but i waited the three days and saved $12 off what Microsoft and the brick and mortar stores wanted for a year subscription. BTW Xbox Live got MLB.tv, HBO Go and Comcast Xfinity today! So I'm excited for my next year on Xbox Live"
5,Xbox live 3 month membership,What more can I say? It's a membership. It takes a few minutes to setup everything. It works and my son enjoys it.
5,good,"Came pretty quick, the box was a little much I though, but then I pulled out the card with the code on it and realized why. They are huge! Kind of a waste of paper, but oh well I got what I wanted.5/5 Awesome"
3,Nice,"We haven't really gone live, but I had gotten this for my husband nonetheless when I bought the console. Will see how it goes"
5,Got it,It worked perfectlynot much more I can say because this review is perfect why do i need to write
5,Easy Peasy!,"What can I say that hasn't already be said? Simple purchase with the code given to me instantly. Put code into my son's account and BAM, worked perfectly (as to be expected)!Will continue to purchase from Amazon/Microsoft online!"
5,"If you have a family, read this...","This membership works great, but if you have a family and want to setup multiple accounts, you need to buy the Family Xbox Live Gold membership. Didn't realize this until I bought this one, BUT... If you buy this and register it on your Xbox Live account then go to Xbox Live website and purchase the Family version, they will credit you for this purchase and give you the Microsoft amount not the amount you paid for which I believe is $69. So you can still save however much this cost you. With the Family version, you can assign up to 4 family members to be able to use the Xbox Live account plus in the Xbox you can control what they can do with the Xbox Live (Parental Controls). With this membership, you can only have one avatar / account on the Xbox that can use the Xbox Live features."
2,hope I can get money back,Grandson got one from someone else. Is there any way to deactivate and get money credited? Otherwise he will have to wait a year to activate
2,Could've been 5 star,"It came quickly in the mail, package was only a little damaged but not that it really mattered. Only problem is it was completely in Russian! I had to get another one because I couldn't read the instructions."
5,ljdfcjacpiajv,i do not know what im writing i dont sell anything on here ui just buy so if ur reading this it is wasting ur tikme
2,Daughter Unhappy,My daughter says she has to pay extra for every different application wheras we thought this covered the cost for all applications a a trial. We were obvisouly dissappointed int the limeted activites compared to the playstation 3
5,I can justify the monthly rate no longer,"I was the type of subscriber who would rather pay the minimal monthly fee than the larger lump sums, despite the overall savings of choosing the latter. But this? THIS? Way too great of a value to pass up. I don't know how Amazon does it, but they do it oh so well. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got some fragging to attend to. See you in the fray."
5,Great Purchase,"I was awe struck to see the price that this xbox live gold card was listed. Purchased it on the spot and haven't had any regrets since. Great Great Great purchase, no issues with the code, or the costs."
4,It worked,It worked. It added time to the end of my existing xbox account. I would buy it again if it was on discount.
5,Cheaper and easy.,This is cheaper than what you can get thru Xbox and they give you the code so it is quick and easy activating it on your Xbox live account.
5,Surprise!!,"Nice to give it in the Christmas stocking instead of just renewing, now its more of a gift instead of just expecting it"
2,WRONG PRICE,"THIS WAS A DAILY DEAL.THE PRICE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE 35.00,BUT I WAS CHARGED 49.46.I DONT THINK THIS IS A FAIR DEAL FOR LOYAL AMAZON.COM CUSTOMERS."
5,xbox live,"Xbox live is the greatest way to game online. Especially when Amazon sells it for $35.99. What a deal. Xbox live is worth every penny, don't listen to those PS3 fan boys, xbox live is by far the way to go."
5,great value,This was a great value for the money and we were able to use it right away. It was great to find this xbox sign up on amazon!!
5,Very convenient option,This is a great and convenient option for purchasing your online Xbox live membership. i simply made my secured payment and received and instant code and it was a neat way for me to give my little cousin a gift.
4,"GREAT for the price, but...","The only downfall of buying this is that the code isn't emailed to you, but instead is shipped over snail mail. Oh well :/"
4,meets expectation,"arrived on time, a very good dealused 1 of 3, works for now, would recommend for the price .."
5,Worked great,"Loved that I didn't need to go out to a store, nice to just get a code & put it on my son's x-box 360!"
5,excellent,Quick and simple to get you back online and playing. Only took a few minutes for the code to show up.
5,Exactly what I wanted,"Not much to say really, it's exactly what it says and exactly what I wanted. It arrived in good time."
5,Xbox live 12 month card,Picked up the 12 month card on Amazon for the awesome price that it is in comparison to retailers. Would purchasae again when my subscription is about to expire. Cannot get enough Xbox live!!
2,Microsoft Nickels and Dimes,"I have the same complaint as everyone else who thinks this is a ""cheap"" way for Microsoft to squeeze even more money out of their customers. Yes, I know I have an alternative, which is to simply not buy their products, but this is a review of my opinion of this product - and I gave it."
5,Great buy,These days everything has to be connected to the internet. I found this at a great price and everyone uses this at my house. Great buy
3,Overpiced as hell,"Only buy actual monthly memberships if you're REALLY desperate. Otherwise, it's better to wait around for deals. Microsoft themselves usually have a month for a dollar for silver members, but they don't come up right away, and also you may sometimes need to create alternate accounts to find them.If you really want to shell out more than $5 for a month, I highly suggest looking for the best deal possible, which can usually be found on here or newegg. $25 for 3 months is ridiculous.Although, Xbox LIVE is still a pretty great service, despite the price. They're arguably the most reliable, as PSN and Steam have downtimes that are much more often, if I recall correctly. And the connection tends to be the best on LIVE, and LIVE gets some stuff early, because Microsoft is, well, evil about that.Although, PSN and Steam have a much better selection of games, in my opinion."
4,"Not for me, it's for my son!","Tired of paying $9.99 per month for Xbox LIVE. A friend told me about this, so here I am. My son loves that he has a whole year of LIVE and I love that I'm not paying $9.99 a month! It was easy to order and easy to use the code."
5,I am an actual customer....,Xbox 360 12 Month Live Gold Cardi bought this like 4 days ago n i jus recieved it......it is amazing. i mean its realli cheap n the shipping was super fast. im realli gonna reccommend this to anyone...thanx amazon
2,A waste of money.,A waste of money. Psn is better and free. It is an absolute ripoff. Luckily i only spent thirty dollars.
4,It's XBOX live,"Xbox Live is great for playing games online with your Xbox. I wish it would give you the xbox music (zune) subscription on Windows 8 as well, but I guess I will just have to keep wishing for now. Don't buy this at full price, as deals are constantly coming and going."
5,good deal,good deal save me time from running to the store and money too recevied it in good time my son was super happy thanks
5,The Price Was Right!,"I'm not going to review XBox Live as a service here. Chances are, if you're looking to buy this item, you already know what to expect. However, for the minority that don't know, it's awesome. Don't pay full price ($50) for this though because it can usually be purchased for $40 and sometimes even less. But, if the price is right, buy it. XBox Live is a great service and worth the yearly fee."
3,Price is High,It'd be cheaper paying for the 12mo. subscription plan in the long run for $60. [XBL Gold is $5 per month.]
5,Best way to get xbox live,It was quick easy and it saved me a few bucks. I had my code within 5 mins of my purchased and it worked immediately. Ill never get my card at the store again... unless i can save even more lol
3,GET IT CHEAPER IN BEST BUY NOW,Best buy has it on sale for 40 bucks right now (1/4/12). don't overpay!tried to get it on ebay but best buy was cheaper than auction. it you want one hurry before deal is done!
3,It's ok for deals and other stuff,IThe fact that its required to use netflix or play online kind of stinks.Playstation offers pretty much the same thing for free.
3,Cheaper elsewhere,I buy these every year as stocking stuffers for my sons. I wish I had waited to buy them because now they are $10 cheaper at the wholesale club I'm a member of.
3,"As usual Xbox live Gold delivers, but why does it cost so much?","The title says it all: Xbox LIVE Gold Membership is essential to anybody who has an Xbox 360: the console doesn't really shine until you connect a gold account. That being said, it feels like Microsoft is overcharging for a service that ought to be much cheaper."
1,Rip off,Code didn't work. Not going to make the same mistake twice.vv vv vv vv vv vv vv vv vv vv vv vv
4,Xbox 360 12-Month Live Gold Card,"I had been wanting to upgrade to Gold for a while, and when I found a great deal on this card on Amazon, I bought it. Everything was just as expected. The code and directions are on the card, so it was easy."
5,best value,always the best value for your xbox live subscription. wait for these to go on sale then jump on them
3,"Needed Live in a hurry, setup was easy","I had some friends over and realized that I hadn't yet purchased Xbox Live, so I quick bought and downloaded this code and set it up in about 20 minutes. The Xbox Live setup is kind of a pain, but it's not this item's fault. The code works fine.Buy the cheaper mailed card instead of a downloadable code if you're not pressed for time."
5,"If you don't have a gold Xbox live membership, you're missing out!","I only buy the 12 month memberships for Xbox live, and I usually wait for special sales like this one on Amazon at $35 for the year! I've gotten so many free games from being a gold member over the last 6 months, it's awesome. Especially when Xmas time hits."
4,Xbox live 12month card,I gave it as a present and they really liked it! They play with their friends on line all the time.
4,Why pay more?,"The card arrived within a very timely fashion. I was able to download it with no problems. I recommend purchasing this product from amazon due to the $20 price difference in retail stores. Also, using online versions of your typical 360 games allows you to explore a whole different level of entertainment> competition against random thinking individuals who don't mind using creative ways to compete to win. Hey,make the purchase and have some fun."
2,overpriced,the product itself is good but amazons price was outrageously high the same product at Walmart was 30 dollars compared to the 50 i paid here.
5,Works,"Worked and was very easy to input. As soon as the code was input into my profile I was ""LIVE"" again"
5,Cheapest I could fine,I simply bought the membership here because it was the cheapest 12 month membership I could find. I had no problems with the code.
5,"If you own an Xbox, why not?","Seriously, it makes your Xbox 360 into a multimedia capable machine.If you like to watch movies and TV as well as game, and also be connected to your friends, why wouldn't you have this?"
5,"Buy Prepaid, Risk Free","If you are going to subscribe to Xbox Live Gold, buy the prepaid code. There are several reasons for this:1) It's cheaper. Every time I have checked, you can get 12 months cheaper using a prepaid code vs. giving your credit card number to Microsoft.2) When it's done, it's done. If you want to re-up, buy another prepaid card, it will again be cheaper, and you will keep your credit card number safe. If you don't want to add more time, then just let it run out. No calling to cancel a charge, no dealing with Customer Service (Sales). I would also use other websites to track the cost of this item and buy at it's cheapest.I would also urge you to only buy these cards and codes NEW and from a reputable site such as Amazon. The code they give you is guaranteed to work, no worrying about being scammed because you went for the 'too good to be true' discount offer."
1,Untrustworthy,"I never recieved this product. I was untrustful with online shopping before this puchase, now im completely apphalled and will never trust online shopping. Horrible experience! Now im not sure what to do about this MIA xbox gold membership card.."
1,Waste of time,The item was shipped in a timely manner yet when I tried to use the xbox live card it was not activated . I tried contact the seller and gave him a week to respond but he never did. Therefore I was forced to file a claim on this seller. This was a waste of time for me because now I still have to get a xbox live card.
1,Havent recieved item,"It was supposed to be here August 16th, but now its the 20th and i still dont have it."
2,Boot the modders and hackers. PLEASE!!!,"Modders, hackers, cheaters, glitchers, and boosters have ruined the Xbox 360 live experience for me. If Microsoft is going to charge us for Xbox Live, the least they could do is boot the modders and hackers. I actually wouldn't mind paying for the service if I thought I was getting something for my money.I will be renting most games from now on, only playing the single player, and avoiding the online multiplayer."
4,1 Year X-Box Live Review,"Our home had two X-Live Subscriptions expire around the same time. My wife thinking she was being helpful renewed the two accounts with Microsoft's 1 month subscription of $10.99. This was a re-occurring charge that would have come to a total of $131.88 for one year of X-Box Live. Now times that by two, $263.76! I didn't even realize what she had done until I reviewed my bank statement. I quickly went online to find the cheapest solution and it was Amazon. At $39.99 for one year I quickly grabbed two and canceled the re-occurring monthly from Microsoft. Amazon shipped free in two days and we were up and running. My savings annually overall was $183.76! Thank you Amazon!"
4,Xbox Gold,"Product came in a timely manner which I always appreciate. I didn't expect it to come with a spanish case/writing though. lol That threw me off a little bit. But in the end, a card is a card and it was just fine. Thank you for your speeding timing."
1,Don't Buy,"Attempted to redeem this code on my computer and it did not work, attempted 30 minutes later and It still did not work. Save yourself 6 dollars and buy this on the xbox."
1,Waste of $,"Code didn't work. I tried multiple times, both on website and console. This was a real disappointment since I read all of the great reviews before hand. I guess its just bad luck for me. Amazon is absolutely no help. This is a black hole item with no seller accountability. Buyer Beware!!!"
1,Code Didnt Even Work,I got a code that didnt even work. Amazon wont answer my call and I have been on hold for 20 minutes now this is ridiculous never doing this again with amazon.
5,Unbelievable Deal!,"Current Xbox Live Gold subscription is $59.99 + tax. I haven't seen a discounted Gold membership through Xbox for at least a year now (since the last price hike).This is absolutely the cheapest alternative you can find to renew your Gold subscription.I purchased the code, received the code via email, and renewed my 1-year Gold subscription in less than 15 minutes. Amazing!"
5,Cheap and Easy,Getting the online code from Amazon was cheaper than it would have cost me from Microsoft and just as easy.
5,Convenient and cheaper than regular price,I bought the online code and got it immediately at check-out. When I redeemed the code it kept giving me the error. Turns out if you have a suspended account (because your payment for auto renewal isn't valid) you can't redeem the code. So I had to call xbox support to cancel the automatic renewal. The whole process took like 15 minutes total on a saturday morning so it wasn't that bad. I wish they let you do that online.
1,Bad service and seller,"I bought a X Box 360 12 month live card from a seller on amazon marketplace and it was for my daughters birthday. When she opened it is was so family could see her on her birthday with the kinects using the internet. We were unable to input the card and to find out it was never activated, so the card is worthless. I called X Box and they are looking into the situation. Now the seller won't refund all the money, only part of it."
2,Amazon Digital Content Policy,Like previous commenters I was burned by asking for gift cards with the intent of purchasing this product. After speaking with multiple agents with Amazon's customer service I was finally told that all digital downloads require a credit card to be added to the account to verify the purchaser is in the States. While this is a requirement (legally or contractually I don't know) Amazon could go a lot farther in making this clear.
1,"Another 50$, really?","I got it for kids for ""CHRIST""mas. All their friends play on it so what the hell. Sad that it is yet another bill. Have to have the net to get it to work and then add this price to it. Makes me sad. And now it is starting to bait the kids into, movies, music and additional game downloads. Oh well, enjoy kids! Cause Daddy aint throwing anymore $$$ at it."
1,god damnit,"I hate that I have to buy this to watch netflix or play halo with pals. what the hell microsoft, you got enough money already, stop this."
1,Bull Shmack,"I think that Microsoft sucks by making their customers who have already spent hundreds of dollars on the gaming system buy a Gold Membership in order to access Netflix...which a consumer has already had to pay for internet as well as netflix for..... Microsoft ""Let's just stick it to them some more"".... Wii and other consoles dont require this type of extra costs."
1,so bad,"I live in Clombia, and I dont know that code is just for USA, so if someone of you wants to buy me the code I can give you cheap"
5,Fast!,I bought this item and it appeared on my e-mail within 2 minutes. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to get their membership fast and wants to play that night.
4,XBOX Live 12 Months Renewal Review,"After purchasing, the code came in my email really quick. Good price and convenient compared to buying the full price at stores."
5,Great,"Got it for my husband, he goes on live everyday now! Its a good price for a year membership and I would def recommend it"
5,easy,"Much better to get code online than picking up in store. Use this if you play a lot online games with Xbox and if you want to get full use of Netflix, Hulu and other apps"
1,Code didn't work,I got the code and it didnt work. I sent numerous emails trying to get a new code but no emails back. Don't buy these codes
1,"4 hour wait for an ""instant"" download code","Tried this for the first time today for ease of use and it is supposed to be instant. Took over 4 hours for the code to get emailed to me, better to just run up to the store and buy a prepaid card. NOT recommended, bad expirence."
1,Xbox Live,This took way too long for me to access my code. Very Disappointed. Amazon should do a better job. They should give the code upon purchase so an accident is not made and no one buys a second code.
1,error,that card or code dosnt work say something like have a mistake or that code is unable for that aplication or somehing like that please i need a solution or i need my money back i really appreciated your help
3,Get what you pay for.,"The delay in receiving a code for these is a bit unsatisfactory, but aside from that you definitely get what you pay for."
5,Great!,This is online access/play for the Xbox at an affordable price which makes my teenage son happy...what more needs to be said?! :)
4,Easy to purchase and use,The key comes immediately and you can use it right away. The price is half off the month to month so you save a few bucks as well.
3,Too expensive!,"Better than buying through MS and normally cheaper too, but I find both this and the xbox live points to be too expensive."
5,Exactly what it says,"Good purchase, this was less expensive than some other places, so I bought two one for myself and the other for a sibling so we could play live together. I'd purchase this again."
5,Works in Canada!,"I was a little concerned about this, since it states USA only, but it was on sale, and I figured it was worth a try. THe code works even in Canada!"
2,"can not be used out of U.S, and it did not mention in the description.","can not be used out of U.S, and it did not mention in the description. I have wasted $25... sad~"
4,Great Price,"Great price on the 12 month membership card when I got it. Works as expected, would purchase again."
3,Really?,"Really, Amazon? You want me to review my purchase of an Xbox live membership? Shall I also review my cable bill? This is a necessary annual purchase if you want to take full advantage of the Xbox' online features. The purchase was compulsory, given that I want Netflix on my TV and the ability to play the online multiplayer modes of some of my games. Amazon labels three stars with ""It's OK"", so there you are. I am neither impressed nor disappointed in what amounts to an elective utility bill."
1,Too expensive just to use basic services,I understand paying to use Microsoft's online services but needing the account for things like Netflix is ridiculous. I won't be buying another Live membership.
1,no good,The code i recieved for my membership did not work. My xbox kept saying it was an invalid number. I would not take the chance and just buy it from a store in person.
1,wow microsoft code didnt work?,"I purchased a code from you and immediately tried to enter the code on my xbox 360, but it said the code has already been used!!!what?!?!?! who sells used codes on amazon? I deserve reinbursement"
2,Didnt even use it,"I did not get a chance to really use it, but it seemed if I took the time to I would of liked it."
1,"Yeah, something not quite right here","Waited for the delivery which didn't happen due to a mis-communication which does not rate the one star. As soon as I emailed them they sent me the code by email within a day. So far great. Took the code down and gave it to my nephew as a birthday present the following month. By the time he got around to keying it in it said that code had already been used. Okay, now the down hill slide. Emailed three times with no response on it and ended up using Amazon to get my money back which I then promptly used to buy a digital code from them. So shifty would explain it best."
1,Don't Buy it,I bought 2 cards and a month later Microsoft said my existing account was closed due to lack of payment. Microsoft said that they would honor the card if I could provide the number but lets get real who keeps the card after you use it.I will never but this type of item again I would rather pay Microsoft.
1,12 single month cards!!!,"I was sent 12 single month cards instead of one 12 month card. That's a lot of numbers to enter and bad business, I'll be ordering from a different company next time."
5,absolutely flawless,":) I was paying $29.95 per 3 months - only for convenience at the time - but wanted to get back to my yearly gold membership. Bought it, got the code and had my renewal up and running in 5 minutes. Yes!"
5,Let the games begin!,Ordered the Online Game Code and once the payment process went through I was given my code right away. Redeemed it through my Xbox account the same moment and started playing! Thank you!
5,Xbox LIVE 12 Month Gold Membership Redeemable Card,"Great price, saves me a lot of effort from monthly bills of 9.99.Worth your time, look for those sales."
5,really fast,Loved that I could ge the code right away. Great feature and save a little money as well! Thanks Amazon!
5,Fast & Easy,"I prefer buying the codes for XBL versus using my credit card since Microsoft seems to automatically sign me up for auto-renewal, which I am not a fan of. I got this code and it was immediately emailed to me. Also, getting this code is a bit cheaper than getting it anywhere else."
3,XBox Live,"We ordered this this for our sons to share. We found that only one person can be on a membership, not two. So, for us this was a disappointment."
4,Simplicity to the Max,"This is an amazing idea. I saw a few other xbox live offers while shopping but this is the only one that actually gives you the code right then and there. No shipping fees or waiting around for it to come. You just make your purchase and they give you the code right after you hit purchase. I told them to email it to me but it never came as an email, that is the only reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5. But I had my xbox ready to go and just entered it right from the page. If you're not doing it right as you buy the code I definitely recommend you take a screenshot of your code because personally, the email never came with the code."
4,Just what I expected,"Just what I expected, it gives me the chance to play my favorite games y watch my favorite movies, I really recommend it."
1,Didn't Woork,"I got an email telling me my promo code and it was invalid. First of all my promo code wasn't even 25 charters , what a rip off!"
1,unredeem,I bought for second time a code for my son's xbox live and for second time doesn't work. I unbelievable that you sell online codes that are wrong.Xbox LIVE 12 Month Gold Membership [Online Game Code]
1,"Too much wait, Not instant !","It is not Instant at all, I'm waiting for it and its been an hour. Bad service!Disappointed alot, -1."
1,Ripoff,"Why raise the price? Getting a one star, can't stand this. Look somewhere else!!!!!!!!!! I'm sure you can get this for less away from Microsoft and Amazon"
2,Do they send you the code by email?,because im confused by the two opions they give you and the custmor service does not help at all with my issue
2,code Didn't work for me,I went to use the code and it didn't work for me and now i'm out the 20 i spent on it
4,Super Fast,So i bought the code and got it instantly. I wish the price was cheaper more of the 30 dollar to 35 dollar range. Other than that great service and nice deal on getting it cheaper than retail.
2,Shun World Wide Sales,Companies that lure customers with their 'deals' offset by outrageous S&H need to be dissed and derailed. That kind of practice reeks of deceit and deception. Prova*tage has a 12 month subscription for $38.41 with reasonable S&H--that's about as good as anyone will get for now.
1,Customer Service Nightmare,"I purchased this item as a gift. The code was entered on the exact date that the current subscription was scheduled to end. On the same day, Microsoft attempted to charge a 3 month renewal to the same account. Somehow, it caused this account to become a 15 month subscription and we were locked out. After calling Microsoft, they cancelled the entire account and re-issued a 12 month code via e-mail. This code does not work, and Microsoft has told us there is nothing they can do because they sent the code and our e-mail must have been hacked. Basically, I have wasted my money because I have no way to use the product I paid for. DO NOT SUPPORT X BOX LIVE."
1,doesnt work,The code was not accepted. I would like money back please. I treid it several times and the xbox would not accept it
1,The only bad review for Amazon purchases - Wish I could give 0 stars,"This should be a 0 (ZERO) star review, but I have to select at least 1 star. I placed an order for an Xbox membership from this company and never got it. On top of that, I sent several emails to them and never once got a reply. When I called Amazon to ask about the order after 34 day, they said the company canceled the order. Uh, why wasn't I notified of this?? Why does my order status still say ""pending shipment""?? I will not buy something from this company again."
1,I don't know,"I am still trying to figure out what good is this thing to have. To be honest I still don't see the benefits. I do not see anything that I couldn't get on my own computer. I got it to have access to Netflix. I still have to pay for Netflix, so I am not renewing this thing. I will just get different device like a blue ray $60 to have access to Netflix."
1,still hasnt arrived,well i ordered this about a month ago & i still havent got it. had to pay for xbl gold until it arrives
3,gewat product,great game. My order was processed and I received before the date that was predicted. I trust Amazon to stand behind their sales.
3,it's the cheapest,"I use these for Xbox Live to play on-line with my friends, it's the cheapest way to do this, you can get a 1 Month card and there is a 3 Month card, But the 1 year is buy far the cheapest way to go."
5,quick and easy,just enter your debit/credit card information and you'll get the code simple as thatNOTE: do not close the window after entering your card information or you'll lose the code!
5,It's Xbox LIVE... Do I need to say more?,"It's Xbox LIVE. You can stream Netflix, HBO GO, Amazon Instant Video, Pandora and a slue of other apps and of course, play multiplayer online games with people from all over the world. With the recent deal bringing HBO Go and a few others to Xbox LIVE you can tell Microsoft is looking to compete with TV providers."
5,Xbox live gold in 5 min,"A few clicks and I was already online on my console. It took me 5 minutes for ordering, receiving the code online and activating it."
5,It is what it is,This is exactly what it should be. If you can watch and get it at a discount for $35 that is a great deal.
5,xbox live membership,when i ordered this game code i wasn't ready for the quickness that it took for the code to be entered and operating on the 360 xbox. it was without any question the easiest purchase i ever made. it works very well. thank you and keep up the great job.
4,A great gift,"I bought this as a gift for someone who plays a lot of Guitar Hero. It is a gift certificate, not a game. I purchase a lot of items from Amazon, and have yet to be disappointed!"
3,Alright,"Alright online, nothing to be excited about. Tons of ads on my dashboard from online that I'd rather not see, but whatever since I have to use it to play online with others in games."
5,EXCELENTE PRECIO!,"Ví que este producto estaba en oferta, como 35dlls, y lo compre un poco escéptico pues lo pensaba usar en México. El código me llego a los 10 minutos a mi email y funcionó de maravilla. Estoy muy contento."
4,"Good deal, tricky set-up..","This is a really good deal. You won't find a 12 month XBOX Live membership for cheaper. It was tough setting up...don't know if that was me, the xbox, or the code...hmmmm. Either way, you won't find a better deal. I believe this membership retails at 2x this price."
5,Excellent price.,Shipped quickly and was a great price. I hope they have this deal every year when its time to renew.
5,"good price, very easy",The title says it all. Always keep an eye out on amazons xbox live prices. They are always way better then the regular price.
5,"Fast, Easy & Reliable","Overall I was very satisfied with the item that I purchased. I chose the Online delivery so that I could recieve the code quickly without paying a shipping charge, and I was very satisfied. The code was displayed within seconds after my purchase was complete."
5,Instant,"I bought the card, and the next page that loads gave me the code. Great for if you need live, RIGHT NOW!"
3,Bought 2 got 1,Bought 2 of these guys for $12 the other day; i decided the digital copy would work best because i would get it right away; well i got one code almost instantly the other was emailed to me a few hours later; only problem is they are both the same code. Not sure if anyone else has had this experience.
5,Instant gaming,I really appreciate the ability to purchase this card and receive an instant access code. My boy was very happy.
5,Best Price,Very good quick delivery and you save money instead of auto renew on XBOX LIVE.I have been ordering my Xbox Live cards from amazon for a few years now.The price goes up and down so keep an eye on it you can get a really good deal
4,Love being able to receive codes almost instantly,"Xbox live Gold is required to play games over the Xbox's online service with your friends as well as enjoying other things such as Netlfix video streaming. These 12 month memberships used to be around 30 dollars when they go on sale, now that Microsoft increased the price on their Xbox live gold services, they only go as low as 40 dollars and can be found at this price multiple times within a year. Buying from Amazon also offers a few more pluses: It feels more secure handing your information over to Amazon instead of Microsoft, you get the code instantly after ordering (not always though), and there is no tax for most people! I just wish the instant code service was a little more reliable. A few times already I've had to wait a few hours for the code to come."
5,GREAT DEAL for XBL!,This is the greatest deal for Xbox Live! No need for automatic renewal at $50 a year. Just get a discounted card through amazon.
5,Great price!,Eveyone knows xbox live so I dont need to talk about that. The price is great at amazon. I will be buying one again when this one runs out. Shipped fast with no problems.
5,Great deal!,"By purchasing the 12 month card you save a lot more than you would if you paid with a credit card. In the end, the membership will cost you less than $5.00 a month! Absolutely recommend it! It takes some time for it to activate (it took about 4 hours for me), but it's definitely worth it."
5,Good Value,"Amazon seems to always have this on sale, which is fantastic because Microsoft requiring Gold accounts to use all features in games (online play) is pathetic."
4,SUPER FAST AND EASY TRANSACTION!,"I ordered the live code and as soon the transaction was complete, I got my live conformation and code!! I was a bit skeptical about how fast I would get my code but I can tell you that it was almost instantaneous after paying for it."
5,Thank You Amazon,"I love you amazon. I can't tell you how greatly I appreciate the online code version of this gold membership. You are the best, and my 1st choice for anything when I'm shopping online."
3,.....,"If you know what you're buying, what can be said about this. I didn't have any issues redeeming the code from Amazon. My biggest gripe is that Microsoft charges for use of their network and I don't play games online. I use the network for streaming movies. Now that I have a PS3 I don't have to pay to use Netflix or Amazon Prime apps. Thank you Sony!"
4,"Well, if I must pay",At least I only had to pay $10.99 for 3 months in order to play my Xbox Live as oppose to the regular price of what is it? $29.99 fro 3 months?!!!! I needed it to play all the goodies I got this holiday ( aka my new Halo Edition Xbox 360 and of course Halo 4!)
5,Great for never leaving the couch,Buy this and take a glimpse at the future of never having to leave your house for anything ever again!
5,Membership!,Xbox live! Did not realize all the stuff you can do on a Xbox. The membership really opens the door.
5,Great Price!,"The xbox live 12 month gold membership is great! Especially for the price, there's nothing more than buying something that is less expensive than other stores. So don't hesitate to buy this for a good price, better than WalMart that's forsure."
4,xbox 360 gold membership,works fine good price child happy and now im happyworks fine good price child happy and now im happy thks
2,invalid redeem code,I get my Xbox live 3 month redeem code in the mail from Ups order from amazon & my code is invalid and isn't working I would like a new 3 monthly please
3,still waiting,i ordered for my son after he spent all his birthday money buying an x-box and games. we have been waiting 2 hours now for the order to be processed and believe me he aint to happy. if i could cancel the order i most def. would. I mean its only a code that is getting e-mailed not something coming via pony express
3,Why do I keep paying for this?,"I picked this subscription when amazon was having a sale. I got it about 50% off the normal price, so that is good.But I don't know why I keep subscribing to xbox live. Or more importantly why do they keep charging for it. I just feel it is about time that this service became free.*Full Disclosure* I don't game as much as I used to. And the little gaming I actually do isn't online multiplayer. I know I am not getting the most value out of the service I pay for, but it just doesn't fit my lifestlye anymore.So here are the things that Live does very well that I enjoy1) the BEST netflix streaming ui out there2) UFC without a cable subscriptions3) a watered down ESPN, but without a cable subscription.For now I'm in for another year, but we'll see about next year."
5,great,It was delivered on time. Great price for this product. My son wanted this for christmas. I'm sure he will enjoy very much. He seems to be hooked on xbox live.
4,To Avoid confusion,"So to avoid confusion that some may make is that this card is to only access you to Microsoft's server for Xbox, get pionts and try out new games. This card does NOT include an account to Netflix. You have to pay that seperately. So if you are an occasional game player, don't bother with it. Otherwise it is a great deal for this price. I like the description that the vender placed, defining that Netflix is sold serperately. Meeaning a different subscription. If you own a WII or a computer and just want to download movies and not game with others save yourself some money and use the media listed."
5,Excelent experience,"Excelent experience!! If you wanna play With all yours friends, dont miss this, i play With all World's People and this is the better!"
5,A lot of fun!,I never went a year without buying this and makes the Xbox 360 so much more enjoyable. Allows you to go online and play games against other people and many other things that is listed in the product description.
5,10 bucks cant beat that,black friday ligthen deals n it was real cheap its better cuz u dont have renew each year if ur ot a heavy gamer
4,You get what you pay for =),This is cheaper than paying $60 at the local store or through Microsoft. The redeem code works and would recommend to anyone that wants to save a few bucks and a trip to the local store.
3,Meh'd.,"The price is good, but for the life of me I cannot understand why Xbox live is a paid service when the PSN network has so much more for so much less money. Well, to each their own."
2,code right away..dont think so,i bought the online code version because i could use the code right away then waiting......i didnt get the code and amazon stated it was taking extra time for processing? just go buy it
5,Amazon has the best price!,If you are looking to upgrade your XBox Live membership to Gold than don't look any further. Amazon by far has the best price anywhere. As for the product itself no complaints. Pretty straight forward and very easy to redeem.
5,No problem,I did not have any problem at the time of purchase and is a great way to buy it and enjoy itThanks !
4,if you catch a deal it's worth it.,"as the title says, if you catch a deal it's worth it. sucks you have to buy the internet from these guys but oh well."
4,A superb and exciting story,"This is a superb book telling of a vital battle between Australian and American aircraft and pilots and the Japanese who were attempting to reinforce their forces in Lae with the prospect of attacking the allied forces in this area of New Guinea. The result of this battle was vital for the allies as a positive reinforcement could have seen real problems for the Allies who would have been outnumbered at any given point.The author relies to a very large extent on diaries and personal remembrances, along with unit histories, to tell his tale. He focuses on the individual planes to a large extent and takes you into the cockpits with the crews and also sees the battle from the point of view of individual Japanese soldiers who are undergoing attack. This makes the description riveting, enthralling and very personal.I would recommend this book to anyone looking for an exciting retelling about this pivotal battle."
3,True life account from survivors,The book was a factual account from survivors. The author has done a good job of researching and including written accounts of the battle from both sides.
1,Horrible print - but you may have an alternative!,"As others have posted, this was possibly the worst print of the movie they could find - it is full of very noticeable scratches and horrible cuts that cause momentary gaps in the movie at various places. Plus it's a pan & scan. What they did to this great film is an embarrassment to the DVD business.But, there is now an alternative...If you have a Region 2 compatible DVD player that can handle PAL (or a computer that can read and play region 2 DVDs - which is more common), then you can buy this version from Amazon.co.uk.http://www.amazon.co.uk/Melody-DVD-Jack-Wild/dp/B002VD5SA6/This version (which I ordered and had shipped from the UK) is an absolutely stunning print - not a scratch to be seen. And it's a wide-screen version as well."
2,Superb movie spoiled by poor quality DVD,"This is easily a five-star movie, one of the best ""school days movies"" ever made, and the audio quality is quite good, but the quality of the video is poor with scrapes on the film not repaired and carried over onto the supposedly ""digitally remastered"" DVD. It would also have been nice, considering the price of this item, if the disc had included subtitling for those who are hard of hearing, but the biggest problem with this product is the poor quality of the video. For a movie from the early Seventies, better prints should be available."
3,"good movie, bad sound quality","Love the movie, saw it in Mexico when I was young. The quality of the recording is not too good, but I am happy to have found, and now own my copy. Shipper was very professional. Product was shipped very promptly."
2,Melody,The reason why I didn't like this product was that the copy of the film was bad to watch. The film starts with a bad picture that has lines down it and what I can describe has green burn marks flickering. To be fair it does get better has the film goes on but then it does happen later in the film.With the quality so poor I had to buy the product from another seller has I'd originally brought the 1st copy has a birthday present. I wouldn't have been happy to have given this to anyone.
3,"If you like the Bee Gees, you'll love this","I found this movie because it is apparently an influence for Wes Anderson's _Moonrise Kingdom_. I can see the influence, but it's definitely not as charming. Maybe it was just getting used to the accent. The movie seemed to be more about the relationship between the two boys than the boy-girl relationship. In fact, it isn't until about an hour into the movie that we see them express their feelings for each other.It's full of songs by the Bee Gees. I liked the music a lot, but it's not music-driven the way _Moonrise Kingdom_ is. Maybe my expectations were too high? It's a good movie, but not a great one."
1,Just Don't,"I give one star for Todd's artwork, but this comic stinks. Maybe it's unfair to compare this with Frank Miller's brilliant Year One. So I won't. All things being equal, this is just a bad comic. For some reason they seek to answer the question: why doesn't Batman use guns? The answer: who cares? This is just a series of bad ideas wrapping up with an ending that makes you wonder why you bothered with this in the first place. One of the worst Batman books I've read."
2,meah...who is this Batman?,"Not the greatest story ever told, but It was entertaining. In this story Batman teams up with his parents killer (joe Chill) to stop a deadly killer called the Reaper. What I didn't understand about this story is why would Batman ever team up with his parents killer and how is it that an old ass man with little training is able to smack Batman around like a little girl? What I kept thinking while reading this book was ""where is the Batman I know?""Id say only bother with this book if you like me are a collector otherwise, there are better Bat tales out there."
3,Weak followup to Year One - an opportunity squandered,"I was disappointed in Year Two; it failed to convincingly follow the groundwork developing Batman's formative years as laid down in Year One (a STRONG story) and The Long Halloween. In Year two, I would have hoped to have the emergence of a longstanding Bats villian, even if a minor one such as The Ventriloquist or The Riddler, but sadly that's not the case. While new villans can be entertaining, the so-called ""Reaper"" reminded me too much of the ""Phantasm"" from the animated Bats movie ""Mask of the Phantasm""; there was no real depth provided to the villian, and the back-to-pick-up-where-I-left-off bit is a tad stale, even at the time this was written. The art was fine; the story good as a standalone tale, but there was really no reason the tale needed to be set in ""Year Two""."
1,Weak storyline fails to capture the essence of Batman,"The book begins simply enough. Batman goes up against a gun toting maniac. However this isn't just any gun toting maniac its his predecessor vigilante the Reaper. The Reaper has no mercy for anyone and is more of a menace than a vigilante. My big problem with this book is that Batman is supposed to have trained for twelve years and be a human paragon. He is also supposed to have the resources and skills to stop a maniac with a gun, no matter how insane. The fact that he decides to work with the man who drove him to become the man he is and use a gun is ludacris. Batman is a Dark Knight. He is called a knight because he posesses chivalry. He's known from the moment he was conceived in crime alley that he can never become what he fights. That is what makes Batman a true hero. However just to see the idiocracy of this horrid book pick it off of the rack. The real Batman Year two is Long Halloween I highly recommend that book instead of this one."
4,A bit less compelling than Griffin and Sabine,"I rushed out to buy ""Alexandria"" as I have done with all of Bantock's books since I was first gifted with ""Griffin and Sabine"" many years ago.I love his work....his books are such a visual treat that even if I do not know what is going on, I enjoy them. I love handling them and looking for hidden clues in the drawings.That said, I feel that I don't know Isabella and Matthew as well as I knew Griffin and Sabine. G and S were much less mysterious and I was able to make more sense of what was going on. I also felt that Bantock wrote each of his original trilogy without resorting to cliffhangers, a device which I find a bit off-putting, and which he used in ""The Gryphon"" and again in ""Alexandria"".However, none of these complaints will stop me from buying anything Nick Bantock writes!"
4,Griffin/Sabine fans will not be disappointed,"This book further explores the relationship between Matthew and Isabella, while Griffin and Sabine offer their support.The love letters between Matthew and Isabella are reminiscient of the letters between Griffin and Sabine. Artwork is top notch.Thought it was a bit weird that there are two postcards (between Sabine and Matthew) entirely in French - thank god for Babelfish!"
2,Griffin & Sabine Alexandria,"I ordered the Trilogy of Griffin & Sabind books from one source, and 3 other individual Griffin & Sabine books from 3 other sources. Four (4) sources in all. The other 3 sources sent used books, but in good condition, with jackets for each book, and no marks. This Alexandria book was received with markings on the front cover, and NO JACKET at all. Very disappointed with the quality of the product, especially compared with the other items received. I plan on returning the book to the source."
2,Down fall,This was a really great story told in a really cool way but with this last book it almost all gose down hill. What was mistrious is now sappy a qultia. This is the down fall of the a great story.
2,All facts!,I was very disapointed in this book. It seemed more like a collection of facts than a insightful biography. I felt I learn little about the two man that I could not have found in a enclopedia.
4,EDUCATIONAL TOOL THAT IS ENTERTAINING,"This film brings the reality of how the working poor fare in the United States. I teach in a public high school and use this DVD to point out the importance of completing some type of post-high school education.The film clearly reflects the strain placed on an individual with children who has not attained an educational degree that will earn higher salaries. At times it is a painful film to watch because of the constant setbacks and roadblocks the four individuals face but it has some lighter moments and one success story. The fact that one of the four was able to escape poverty points out how difficult it is to attain the bottom rung of middle class, when saddled with children and no education.It would be interesting to see an up-date of the four individuals and see how they are doing."
5,"Hollywood, what are you waiting for ?!","It is action-packed like ""Pearl Harbor"", dramatic like ""The Pianist"" and heroic like ""The Band of Brothers""."
4,Great Book,This is a interesting account of a group of Polish solders that were instrumental in the WW II victories of the RAF
3,"First half good, second half ok","I'll keep it short. The first half of the book, which actually talks about the Kosciuszko Squadron, was great. The second half, which relates the political squabbles between Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin, was boring. Dead boring."
5,A Question of Honor,"The story is heroic and very touching to have gone through so much,and not to be able to go home and not to be able to participate in the victory celebrations after the war must have been a bitter pill to take. After all the reason for WWII was the invasion of Poland.I highly recommend this book."
4,Yes,".easy to put up....deliverd on time ,look like its really well made, but i'll keep you posted ,but so far so good"
2,Spare tire carrier,"The carrier was delivered promptly and appears to be well made.Unfortunately, I waited until just recently to try it on my trailer spare and it does not come close to fitting on my 15"" 5-hole rim.I would recommend that you try it out immediately and return if you have a problem with it fitting your rim."
2,Does not work as Described,"Purchased this for my 15"" spare on my flatbed, will not fit any way you mount it even though it says it will. Your experience may vary but I would steer clear if you have a 15"" wheel."
4,Spare tire for ATV trailer,This spare carrier was perfect for my ATV hauler. I simply bolted in onto the back in a location that would clear the tail lights. Pretty quick and straightforward install although I had to invert the direction of one set of mounting bolts due to tire interference.I would have given a 5 stars if there had been a way to use a security cable to secure from theft. As it is I will have to run a cable through the tire somehow instead.Big Red
4,Simple installation,"This was a very easy installation. I had a small bit of difficulty getting the tire on, but that might have been a user error (me). I would have liked some kind of locking device that I could use to make it a bit more difficult to steal the tire."
5,Wonderful Blanket,This is one of the softest blankets I have ever felt. The quality is awesome and I love the different designs offered. I have fallen in love with Baby Star products!!!!
3,Acceptable,"Given the price of tools, these are a fair deal. Finish is generally OK, though the edge fit is a tad off and sharpness is not great. They do work, and are specialty tools at about the price of ordinary slip-joint pliers. My main complaint is with pre-shipment storage/handling: mine came with superficial rust despite all the oil, especially on the most sensitive sharpened surfaces. I may try dressing the cutting edges with a whetstone, but it's easy to damage these complicated curves beyond repair. Meanwhile, they do work and are comfortable to handle, even if they don't make as easy or clean a cut as one might wish."
4,Like angled mini-Farrier nippers and half round,"The is currently a movement among horse owners to emulate the durability of the wild, unshod, hoof. Many women are joining this movement, and finding that the tools of the trade were often designed for bigger hands, or greater strength. These smaller tools, the concave cutter and knob cutter, are useful for trimming, nipping, and shaping tabs, raggedy edges, overgrown frogs, and laid-over bars.In general, the tools are sharp, the blades align perfectly, and they are easy to handle. They are well worth the money!"
1,BAD,"I took these put of their packaging, and noticed they came with a hole in the crotch. I thought, no big deal, but as I tried them on I had trouble getting them up in (and I am very petite) and as I was struggling, they ripped in two places. I have never had this happen before, with any pantyhose, ever. I just wanted a cheap pair because I wasn't going to wear them often, but I had no idea they'd be THIS cheap. Horrible."
4,Good product.,The product was a bit difficult to put on at first and it seemed too short. After a few adjustments it fit on fine. It feels nice on the skin and looks nice as well. It was a good purchase.
2,OK if you order the nude color,"Agree with other people on the snags already in the stockings, I ordered nude so luckily you dont really notice them as you would in black. Def DONT order black...but they will do the trick for the look I am going for. Also the ""seam"" is pretty raised and not flush with the stocking, not a prob per se just an observation."
2,Doesn't Fit Right,"I bought these for my wife, and although we did receive the package quickly, the product picture is misleading. The black part that you see on the bottom of the foot in the picture came up 3 inches above the shoe. My wife has size eight and a half feet and she is 5 foot 6. If she was to pull the back down to the point that you wouldn't be able to see it then it wouldn't fit around the waist or anywhere else. So be aware that this may not fit exactly as pictured."
3,Could be more durable.,"Leg Avenue is usually hit, but on this one they missed just a little bit. The stretch takes a bit longer to wear in, and you must be careful if you're like me and have solid legs! Stretch on these is fair, hence four out of five, seams are a little difficult to get straight on the first go (which is why you have your boyfriend help) and the reinforced feet are wonderful! Will definitely be wearing these when the weather cools a bit.Update: Reducing the review to 3/4 because the back seam has started to come undone after light, more than reasonable wear."
1,Not sheer/nude,"THESE ARE NOT SHEER. They were absolutely black on me. I'm short-ish. But I think the picture is misleading, I thought they were nude."
1,I hate these pantyhose!,"I am 5""7 and these pantyhose are NOT ""One size fits all"" they are too short in legnth, The crotch of these pantyhose starts right above my knee and I would prefer a FULL REFUND for the 3 pairs of these pantyhose!!! I will never order these pantyhose again!!!"
1,Runs Small,"Given that these say one size fits between 90-160lbs I though I would be okay to wear them (I'm about 150 and usually wear tights in this size range), but that turned out not to be the case. They were very difficult to get on and got a huge run in them before I even got them to my thighs. If you're on the smaller end of the spectrum they may be fine, but these are definitely not a good choice for anyone bigger/taller."
2,It Runs Easily...,...unless you wear a pair of regular tights underneath it so at least you can put it on and have a chance of not running it...
1,movie sucked,This movie was the most stupid movie ever. my girlfriend bought it and didnt even watch the whole thing !
2,Not even close,"Not even close as good as the first. I watched it once which is all its good for. Worth a watch if you got nothing better to do, but wouldnt advise buying it!!!"
2,unrelatable and somehow off beat,"I was curious about this movie because Amber Tamblyn is in it. Having not particularly been able to relate to the characters of the first Havocmovie, I found myself at even a bigger loss here. These are lost, lost souls and the characters that are the most redeemable are more lost than everyone else. I'm not sure if the movie was going for a non-judgmental feel or simply didn't know where to take the storyline."
1,Don't waste your time,"If you loved the original Havoc you will HATE this movie. It does no justice to the original which was smart, gritty, and insightful. This is just stupid. Don't buy it, its 2 hours of your life you'll never get back."
3,Not exactly what the picture shows,"Pros: This costume got to my home very fast! I went to go check the tracking and it was already in my mailbox! Wow! The price is reasonable - not the best quality, but its for a one, maybe two time, wear.Cons: The dress that arrived is not exactly what the picture promotes. The white puffy sleeves the picture shows, are actually purple. The white fabric on the chest is also purple. My costume is going to be the Queen of Rapunzel (good mom), and this picture matched perfectly. So although I'm still going to use it, I am a little disappointed I need to modify it a little."
3,Good information - high price - Get book instead,"We bought the DVD for $1.95 at a used bookstore. We immediately bought the book which contains a lot more information. The book is a must read for anyone wanting to eat healthy. If the DVD was $9.95, we would have bought several for friends, who would have then bought books. Not a wise marketing decision in my opinion."
3,Professional quality here.,1. Large target area.2. Wearer has great protection.3. Leather smells heavenly.4. Classy looking product.5. Comes with a tote.6. The glove portion is excellent- velcro adjustment for a sure fit.Buy quality products like these.
4,You Need Only One Reason,"The reason I bought this single was for ""Fog"". I heard the live version on Napster, and simply had to have it. The live version is such a dark and beautiful song that has been Radiohead's calling card. If you are lucky to have the live version, keep it! This is not the live version that features Thom playing the piano and singing, but an interesting studio version with the entire band. It maintains the dark tone of the original, but midway through breaks into a U2-esque guitar bit and then crescendos into an instrumental climax that is completely unexpected. This song is why this single is a must have, and its offering doesn't dissapoint."
4,Radiohead at their most creative,"This single contains all the tracks from the two 'Knives Out' singles released in the US and elsewhere. It doesn't, however, have the superb 'Pyramid Song' video found on one of the other 'Knives Out' singles.Radiohead's 'Kid A' and 'Amnesiac' era work is inarguably their most creative and inventive, and this single isn't a bad reflection of this. If you're a Radiohead fan, you'll be getting your money's worth with tracks like 'Cuttooth' and 'Fog', which are certainly worth the purchase. The 'Pyramid Song' single, however, is their best from this period, so if you're tight and only want to purchase one of them, go with that. Most Radiohead fans will agree, though, that both are worth having. As with all post-bends Radiohead material, it grows on you the more you listen.Overall an enjoyable, worthwhile purchase, for anyone who enjoyed Radiohead's 'Kid A'\'Amnesiac' era work, provided you don't already have the other two 'Knives Out' singles."
4,"Old-school Radiohead, Part Deux","Like CD1, CD2 contains more up-beat and catchy songs we haven't heard from Radiohead in a while. ""Worrywort"" and ""Fog"" are not amazing tracks, but they are a nice departure from the non-radio-friendly Radiohead style of late, and I really enjoyed listening to the happier and more melody-driven sound."
4,Life in a glasshouse surely not over ambitious,This single helps new new and old fans alike to appreciate what got them to this point in their music. If you listen to kid a and amnesiac you will certainly understand and see that the bends is on every album. Knives out is certainly one of these songs. And the single release of cuttooth contains new and old radiohead riffs. And life in a glashouse is perfect the way it is. They are not over ambitious.
3,"If you have the album, its not worth the single.","Knives out, while not the best radiohead song ever, in fact one of the weaker songs on amnesiac, is a good choice for a second single. But for a huge radiohead fan that already waited till midnight to get Amnesiac, is it worth it? The answer is no. There are 2 b-sides, and both of them are weak, and you can tell why they werent on the album. Track 2, the amazing sounds of orgy, isnt what the title sounds like (lol) and is pretty easy, boring, and quite repetitive. The third song isnt that much different from the album version. The only good thing about this CD is the pyramid song video. But if you must have it, you can download the songs off of morpheus or something, because there arent any booklet inserts or anything. If you can find this for a good price, you should get it. If not, dont even bother, and get some of the singles from OK computer."
4,Saga does it again.,"This album follwed up their hit ""Worlds Apart"". Very underrated CD from a very underrated band from Canada. Hopefully they will be re-discovered."
5,Buy it if you can find it,"This and Worlds Apart are my 2 favorite SAGA albums. Oh yeah, for a previous reviewer's info... SAGA IS STILL AROUND. Check out their website if you don't believe me."
2,DVD Limited - No real visual techniques.,Thought this might be nice to learn better sensual massage techniques or love techniques...dissapointed...no good closeups... no real instruction - CHEESY..
4,Lock out,Purchased these for our service engineers. It is required for them to work on electrical machinery and provides a safe enviroment for them.
5,Great for Strong fighting reds in the Kenai,I just purchased this reel for fighting Reds on the famous Kenai. It's breaking system was awesome. I would highly recommend this reel for anyone looking to catch tough fighting fish.
4,This book is a must for the rookie intaller!,"This fabulous book explains the technical installation in an understandable fashion. The pictures are pretty lame, but they do a good job of showing you what you should and should not do. Everthing from amps to speakers to decks is simplified in such a manner that anyone should be able to install their own stereo after readin' the book"
3,Helpful,I have used this book mostly for ideas. And building my doors and front pods. It covers many helpful things most other books don't.
3,To Basic,"I bought this book for my son, who is 15, he said the book didnt tell him anything he didnt already know. We are looking for a more advance book."
1,not worth the time,"I bought this book because I was looking for help in hooking up my stereo system, in my car. I'm still looking... This book MIGHT have been half-way helpful if they had some more detailed wiring diagrams. Although the fact that everything in this book is something along the lines of 10+ old tech. The guy with the mullet in alot of the install pictures and the presance of tape decks all over the place really tells you just how outdated it is."
3,What if a French Alan Lomax visited the Netherlands?,"Songs borrowed, adapted, and morphed, many probably left by Napoleon's troops, are the Dutch ""traditional"" works highlighted here, sung as remembered and matched to extensive notes on French sources. Streektaalzang sources online are hit-or-miss but offer far more flavors of ""Dutch"" music and discography."
1,I wasted my money on this,"This book LIGHTLY touches on different methods of accessing databases, and mildly covers Oracle. It never even mentions Oracle new tools for Web related developement (a glaring omission in my opinion, it's what I was really hoping for given this books misleading title), it just covers generic methods for accessing databases from the web. It takes 300 pages to get to some usable code(!), and even then it's a pretty lame choice of technological solution as to how the access is done. A coulple of chapters are spent blathering on a about Oracle's SQL Administator (Why? of what use is this for this book?). Also covered is a basic primer on Oracle SQL that is also unneeded. I had high hopes for this book and was VERY disappointed. I would NOT reccomend this book to anyone."
2,Insufficiently detailed description of tool,"As a means to understand how to use the Developer 2000 series of programs, this book lacks detail or explanation. It tries to straddle a description of methodology and that of program function, and does a poor job of the latter.We already have a good understanding of how to get the job done -- we just wanted to use the tool. Thus, we only skimmed the parts of the book we considered were just a tepid introduction to Yourdon.If you already comfortable with task analysis, problem decomposition, and normalization, and simply want to know how to use this tool to develop a system, move on to something more practical, such as ""Rapid Application Development With Oracle Designer/2000"" by Chris Billings, et.al."
1,Still contains factual errors,"I was hoping that this edition would correct the problems of the earlier edition, but I was disappointed to find that many of the errors remained.In addition, the text appears to be poorly edited, and the content is sometimes confusing and obtuse.Overall, I was disappointed in the content and the editing."
3,"""Handbook"" should be changed to ""Description""",This is just a description of Oracle's product Designer2000. Usually the fact that a book is not detailed enough is due to the authors' lack of technical competence. I recommend this book to non-programmers such as managers.
3,guideline for beginners is missing,"if new users are teken this book as a guide its very difficult learn the designer/2000. i think this book has to concentrate more on module logic, application prefrences etc. when we are little bit familiar with the tool, then suits good."
3,GOOD INFORMATION,I THINK THIS BOOK IS OF GREAT QUALITY.THE INFORMATION HAS BEEN SIMPLIFIED SO THAT EVERY ONE CAN UNDERSTAND.EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE THIS BOOK IN THEIR HOME LIBRARY.
3,George Evans,I enjoyed this but again it lacks what I'm looking for. I knew Jerry Fuller very well and am sorry he's gone. We did a lot of playing together. When I lived in Canada I thought I knew alot but NY teaches one that they know little and opens up your ears. It's all here. Decent cd.
5,I love Howard Zinn!!,"I have listened to many of Howard Zinn's talks and could not turn it off. After listening to his speeches, I could not help but purchase his books."
5,Greatest Asset: It's Enjoyable,"Howard Zinn's encyclopedia of knowledge is in no way bland. Rather, he's uses cunning story telling to bring what is normally a dull subject into an exciting and sometimes horrifying reality. Speaking from the viewpoint of the minority, Zinn picks up where history class left off. He forces us to question our past and present actions. Unearthing subjects never questioned, Zinn asks those tough questions. His chapters dealing with Native Americans and Blacks in the early Americas are my favorite chapters. Empowering the minority, Zinn sends two messages. Can progress still be justified if it is an the expense of others? And, Is our nation's history our own history."
1,A peoples history of the United States: 1492-present,"Distorted, leans so far left it was difficult to read. Please spare the bleeding heart liberal slant on history, life is not fair - period. Without this country and the principles it is founded on, life would indeed be misery, for millions more people than are currently suffering in Third world countries, or under the hammer of communism. Please let history speak for itself,good or bad and don't inflate or deflate it according to personal agenda."
1,Old and tired,"If this were 1967, at least we could excuse the writer and his fans as understandably being caught up in the revolutionary drama. But, now over 30 years later, all that remains are tired lies told by a tired old man who practices a dead blind faith in a forsaken religion. Enough, already."
5,An Important Message : Study History Beyond The Classroom.,"As Americans in grade school we are often taught through our American history textbooks to be patriotic, proud and forgiving of America's small flaws.Howard Zinn paints the true story of what America has become through another point of view : the victims.Often people discount such works as lies because it does not mirror their own ideologues and offers different evidence than often taught in the schools across America.The message taught throughout this book leaves you to question almost everything you were taught.I may not agree with all of the words Zinn uses but his point is still as valid when the book was written, whether or not you agree with the book : Study history beyond the classroom."
2,The other extreme from history books,"I first must say Howard Zinn has the correct idea. Write a history book the opposite of what many read in school. In other words, tell the bad or seedy parts of United States history. After reading this book I have to say Mr. Zinn has done as much disservice to our countries history as the other history books. According to Mr. Zinn nothing was done anytime in the US that was for the good of the people. Nothing. Ever. With a BA in history I spent many hours studying our country. Yes, we have done bad things throughout the years but we have also done good things. To categorize every episode as a capitalistic endeavour controlled by the rich is a one-sided view of the events. Instead of A People's History of the United States this book would do better with a title more a long the lines of The Other View of the History of the United States."
5,Eye-opening!,"This book was given to me by my brother, and I really liked it. Everything was well-written, and it is a great antidote to school-book history. If you like this book, you should also read ""Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong"" by James Lowen."
5,"An excellent work, in its context.","An exciting reed which opened my mind a bit towards American History which, at first, I thought was shallow. Some have called this book as extremely politically correct babble. Those who say this have apparently not read the book in enough detail. It is a polemic as he states rabidly in the first chapter and cannot be expected therefore to be argumentative. A reader wanted a balanced view would have to read this in corroboration with other works on the same topic. It is exciting and a pleasant read for the passive reader."
5,the most inspiring and interesting history book I've read,"This book was one of the first history books I've ever been able to read cover to cover (and I was a history major!) It was far more interesting than the nautious repetitiveness of those historians who tell U.S. history from one president to the next. (and who cares what size his bed was anyways?) So what if the author is radical in his views? Isn't it about time we heard something fresh, something different then the uninspried mainstream goo we wade through all our lives? I think this book just might change my life."
2,Fight Fight Fight for Revolution!,"Pray pray pray for social schemes, We will drag them down, And we'll grind them in the ground, And replace them with a working-class regime!If we ever really had the kind of working class/populist/participatory government Zinn seems to want, the first thing that such a mob would do is burn down the BU campus and Howard Zinn's house. I liked the book when I was 17 and stupid, but after reading real historians like Braudel and Woodward, Zinn seems laughably amatuerish.... END"
3,knee-jerk history,"History is a sort of science. There are right and wrong ways of doing it. Zinn does a wonderful job of pointing out how traditional history books are incorrect in numerous portrayals of the past. However, he commits the same sin as the traditional textbook. Instead of finding the happy medium, he swings to the left and leaves readers in the dust.Zinn does a fine job of pointing out hypcoracies in American history but does not discuss why they occur. These reasons are usually political, but Zinn decides not to explore them further. He just makes the reader think if something is a hypcracy it is therefore wrong, end of discussion. This theory is as tunnel visioned as the conservative accounts of history Zinn is fighting. I am not arguing for hypocracy, I am arguing for a fair treatment of past events."
4,"Not the Whole Story, but...","What Howard Zinn has purposefully done is to look at history from a different viewpoint, the viewpoint of the poor, of the oppressed. Does he support socialist/marxist principles? Yes.Don't let yourself prejudge this book, though...I feel it absolutley deserves to be read, no matter what you think of Zinn's political beliefs."
1,Have you ever heard him lecture?,"I would simply like to ask if any of these people have ever heard him give a lecture. Not only does he not follow a logical pattern of thought, but preaches the need for a revolution. My reason for not caring for him is not because my views differ from his, the reason is that I can't listen, or read, from a person who cannot form a clear thesis, argue it, while still finding time to dispel doubts by disproving the oppositions arguments. Howard Zinn simply spurts out ideas without having any back up. This book of his has the potential to be good, but before I would ever call it so, Howard needs to learn the finer points of making an argument."
5,Far more interesting than history class,"If you are a student at a junior high or high school, read this book and just try to sit through your blindly patriotic Bougeoise History class with a straight face. Some of the facts in this book simply will never appear in your history book until our society changes drastically."
5,Greatest High School Text book I have used,"I am currently a 11 th grader @ Hamilton HIgh School . This Book is being currently used in the Ap classes and in the Humanities Honors classes . This book not only reports the common man's story but it in a elegant way does not romanticize the victim who tend to be the common man. I would reccommend this book to any person who does not want to hear the cleaned up version of history. Another book that does the same thing is"" Lies my Teacher told me "" this book also deserves a five."
5,A real history about real americans,"A useful contrast to the official, jingoistic histories taught to America's children, this book is essential to a full understanding of US history. Some have complained this book is anti-American and rated it low for that; I say that it provided a startlingly different viewpoint that will be invaluable to those who study history.Zinn quite clearly states that his sympathies are not with the rich and powerful (who seem inordinately fearful of his analysis). I have found no factual errors in his work; anyone who can demonstrate he got facts wrong is free to point to specific instances and complain. No one has done that yet."
4,History from another point of view.,"First of all a very well written book with a casual style that makes for easy reading. I really felt, however, that Mr. Zinn has nothing at all good to say about the capitalist system. I cannot say that the US system of capitalism is the perfect system by any means, but nothing else has done so much for so many. Socialism, Marxism, Communism, Fascism, Collectivism, etc. None of these have stood the test of time. Why is it that even after more than 200 years of ""horrible"" capitalism that millions try to immigrate to the United States every year? I think the answer is, ""as bad as we are, we're the best there is."""
4,Entertaining and Informative,"I had to purchase this book for my U.S. History class. I can honestly say that this is the first text book that I actually enjoyed. Zinn gives the reader a different perspective from the mainstream history books. He gets to the crux of the matter and isn't afraid to show Americans what really happened.I gave it four stars because there is a definate bias throughout the book. Some may not feel comfotable with it.However, overall it is a good book. Buy this book whether or not you're taking a U.S. history class!"
4,Great for History Buffs and Interested Readers Alike,"Tis is a great book for history fans who want to know more obscured viewpoints of historical events. Instead of giving a play-by-play description of the battles of the numerous wars in American history, Zinn shows how these major events affected the minorities during the given time period. The book is filled with interesting and relevant primary sources (letters, journals, etc. from the time period) that makes it an excellent book for not only research, but also pleasure reading (if you like history, that is.) But if you have a short attention span or are easily distracted, it may be hard to fully understand the book because you need to fully absorb what it has to say in order to understand it well, which may leave you bored after a while. To tell the truth, I havent finished my copy, but I still find it enjoyable on calm, non-stressful days when I can fully pay attention."
1,Don't Bother with this one,"This book is is nothing more than a recounting of all the dark moments in American History. These moments need to be documented and remembered, but not told all together in one breath as Zinn has presented. He seems to take pride in exposing all the ugly horrible things that have happened in our history and not presenting suppporting evidence for the contrary.There is a brief section on the Vietnam War which seems to be more impartially documented, but the rest is a witch hunt for negativism in AMerican History.To clearly understand the issues he writes about, I stongly advise reading other books focued on each subject-- for instance, A Womens History of the United States, A History of Black America, the sad tale of the Real Americans etc.I honestly believe that Zinn has presented these issues in a way that will blurr proper understanding of these sad characteristics of American History"
4,"A Worthwhile Read, Despite a Misleading Title","To use the title of a ""People's History"" is misleading. While the author is up front in saying he will be selective, the title still infers something that it is not. Still, it is an interesting read and helps expand our depth of America's history for those groups traditionally ignored.One question begs to be asked about this book. Based upon some of the comments for this work, and its abridged edition, can its sales be weighted by teachers making it a required reading?Despite this question, I can recommend it to anyone interested in American history."
3,pretty but scared to use,"I am thrilled with how well this matches my grandmother's Franciscan Apple set but am scared to use it in the oven. So far, I haven't cooked in it as I am not sue how well it will hold up."
3,couldn't use it,It is made for a small mouth (or maybe my husband just has a big mouth)as far as the area around the teeth but you would need a wide mouth for the area between the teeth. I hope that isn't too confusing. It just didn't fit very well or comfortably but others may find it suitable.
1,Horrible,Not only did it take me almost 30 minutes to get a sub par fit but training with it was really uncomfortable. Is very hard to breathe when using it.I did not recommend this product.
2,For the Kids only,"This is a decent mouthguard and has two very nice features; one it protects the upper and lower teeth and has a nice air vent to aid in mouth breathing but the main downfall is it is SMALL! Like very small, kid size only. Not recommended for teenage or adult males.The description does not mention it is really a junior size but it is.The only other downfall is that it does not come with a case so you will need to keep it in a ziplock or buy a container separately for it to keep it clean."
2,Mouth guard,"This type of mouth guard is durable but the only problem is, even though i am an adult it was difficult to fit in my mouth which made it uncomfortable to wear"
2,Maybe mine is the only one cheaply made?,"Not exactly sure why there are so many good reviews about this mouth guard. For one, like one of the only previous bad reviews stated, it doesn't shape itself at all. This wasn't that big of a problem for me since it seemed to fit pretty well for what little amount it did form to fit my mouth. Anways, since I've never used a double mouth guard before I wanted to get used to it, so I decided not only to train with it on the mat and the ring (MMA of course), I also decided to run with it. This would help for me to get used to breathing with it. After about three weeks of use, the bottom guard started to get really flimsy...and actually tore on the inside. I'll be sticking with single mouth guards from now on."
3,I was disappointed,"I enjoyed Sister Sister and expected a similiar style of writing but I felt like everyone was talking at once. I am an avid reader, 4-6 books a month, but I forced myself to read half way and couldn't take it anymore. Much success in the future Eric."
4,YOU HAVE DONE IT AGAIN,THE WAS A VERY GOOD BOOK .IT FELT LIKE I WAS THERE EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.I FELT LIKE I KNOW THESE PEOPLE.ONCE AGAIN YOU PUT ME RIGHT THE IN THE MIX.CAN'T WAIT TO READ THE NEXT ONEA LOYAL FANSUNNY
4,So Good!!,"I read this years ago, but the characters are still very clear to me.The story line of friends and falling in love is classic, but EDJ has a way of making you one with them. This book will make you laugh and cry at the same time."
3,I Don't Know...,"Ever since I read ""The Other Woman"" by EJD, I wanted to get my hands on everything's he's written. ""Friends and Lovers"" was mediocre and I pretty much just finished the book, just to finish it. I found it very hard to like Shelby. She was really starting to get on my nerves with her damn attitude. I wish someone would have punched her in her kidneys so she'd shut up! I'm a black woman and I know black women can have attitudes, but hers was annoying. I tried to get a clear picture of everyone involved but I felt like too much and too little was going on at the same time."
5,A Oustanding 5* read that u cant put down until its done!!!,I really enjoyed this book. Each character was given their due time and time to shine as well. Tyrel was a handsome find. His character was portrayed with such depth as was every one of the people involved. He & SHelby's relationship seemed rocky yet so solid at times. Leaonard he was a man of standard and he had been like Tyrel's brother in being such a good friend... Tyrel was dealing with a married woman who did him no justice.. Leonard let him know that and so the story goes.... they both wind up with some really special ladies and i dont want to hurt the plot any for those of you who havent read it but Eric has put such spin on this book that it will have you reeling from the beginning to the very end.. Eric Jerome Dickey has a real flair for writing and i hope that you all enjoy this book and many of the others. I have read them all.
5,A fabulous new writer with powerful and real characters.,"Eric Jerome Dickey creates unforgettable characters who live in the real world. These men and women struggle with all the day to day worries of relationships, jobs, and finding the meaning of life for themselves."
5,Best love story from a male perspective.,"This was one of the most enlightening book I have ever read about romance from a males point of view. The turn of events keep you wanting to read more. I myself found it hard to put down. I would recommend this this to anyone who needs a good cry, laugh and smile."
5,A great read that was long overdue,"EJD captures the thoughts and emotions of not only one chracter but four. Just as you get ready to put the book down, you stumble upon a line that makes you read another chapter, and another chapter, and another... Truly a literature that not only impctes the reader, but teaches the reader. Keep them coming EJD!!"
5,It is a great book to read and pass on to a friend,"This book has many underlying elements of African-American love, heartache and understanding. Shelba and Tyrone are the epitomy of Black Love.....breaking up and getting back together; making things right and fighting for what they believe in and want."
5,This book is fantastic!!!!!,I just got through reading FRIENDS and LOVERS and it has been the best book I've read so far. Eric Jerome Dickey did a good job with this one and I could really relate to the characters. I felt as though I knew them. There were times when I thought I was watching a movie instead of reading a novel and I even caught myself crying a few times. Not once did Dickey bash brothers or sisters. He just kept it on a real level with real black relationships.
1,Unbelievable,"Friends and Lovers starts off good but then it reaches a point where you say ""Who the hell cares?"" I hate when the plot gets mangled up by sub-plots that no one cares about. Dickey has a tendency to tack on ""I ain't got no daddy"" or ""My daddy is no good"" subplots that always makes the story go in a dull and unnecessary direction. I usually skip those few chapters and try to find the more exciting parts. Other than the boring sub-plots, F&L is an okay read."
3,Friends & Lovers,"To me, the book was incredibly boring. The chances of something like that happening in real life is so far fetched it's unbelievable!"
1,Bad bad bad,"I really don't understand the good reviews this book has received. There was an overuse of ""sister"", ""brother"", ""light, caramel, ebony, mocha complexion"", product placement, ""kente-wearing"" afro-centric references. It was quite distracting. Why the author couldn't just focus on the plot without interjecting the various skin tones of the BLACK characters I will never understand. I quit after the second chapter because I was tired of lines such as ""with two shakes of my tail I could hypnotize a brother and any other""."
4,Eric Jerome Dickey Does It Again!,"This is my second Dickey novel and I loved it!! He is very talented in his way of making paper come to life. His charaters are real, strong and life-like.This story is of two girlfriends who meet and fall for two buddies. One relationship works like clock-work and the other (although it is intense) doesn't. The story deals with friends trying to deal with crossed bridges, hurt and history.... as well as what to do when your lines cross too much.And with the hurt of real life; and how those broken-up bridges don't really matter when relationships are strong.Read this book!"
2,BORING,There are SO many other reviews that I don't think I can say anything new. It was just very boring. I just don't see the greatness and excellence that others saw in this book.
5,I LOVED IT!!!!!,"I just finished reading Milk in My Coffee and loved it so much that I decided to go back and give Friends and Lovers a try. All I can say is, I'm so glad I did! Now the difficult part is trying to decide which one I enjoyed more. Dickey is such a talented writer. His skill for weaving complex and unpredictable storylines coupled with his uncanny ability to speak in a convincing female voice keep readers like me begging for more! You did it again, Eric!"
5,This is a geat book,When I first saw someone reading this book I thought it looked like it was a good book. So I went out the same day and purchased the book. I couldn't read it the first day I got it because i was busy. But when I finally had a chance to read it i couldn't put the book down. I felt like I was a part of the book.I have to say that this was an excellent book!!!!!! I Give Eric Jerome Dickey a thumbs up and I look forward to reading his other books
3,Friends and Lovers was a good book but...........,"This was my first time reading a book by Eric Dickey, and I had heard so much about it. I think that my expectations were set to high for this book. The book was alright, but I'm definitely glad I didn't buy it. I just wasn't into the book like I thought I would be. The characters weren't developed enough for me, and it seemed like he didn't complete one scene before jumping to the next. I didn't like the way the book hinted that something might happen, then when it did, it left no explanation of how or why it happened. For instance, when one of the characters just jumped up and got married. The story went on leaving me confused and upset. This was definitely not one of my favorite books!"
5,"Once you get past chapter 3, you're hooked!!",This is excellent writing. It will make you laugh and cry. Great reading!!
5,Get out the tissues,"After I'd put away the Kleenex, I ran to the bookstore to find a way to focus on someone else's drama other than my own. This was not the book. I was easily pulled into the storyline, not simply because I knew the locale; EJD has a writing style that is smooth, rythmic and realistic. The characters were well developed, could've been anyone you know, and I found myself getting particularly p'o'ed at some of the choices made by Shelby, one of the main characters. Throughout the book, I laughed, I got mad, took long walks down memory lane, and ultimately cried my eyes out focusing on someone else's drama. I have one complaint though: there isn't enough of his work out there yet. I want more. And one suggestion if you're there, Mr. Dickey: please don't mention real people's names. They just might be the one your reader is trying to forget."
5,This is the best book yet to come,"I HAVE NEVER READ ANYTHING MY AN AUTHOR AS REAL, TALENTED, AND OFF-THE-HOOK FUNNY LIKE ERIC JEROME DICKEY. HIS WORDS ARE SOOO REAL, WHENEVER I READ ANY BOOK OF HIS..THE PORTRAYAL OF EACH CHARACTER SEEMS SO REAL...I COULD ACTUALLY SEE THROUGH HIS WORDS. I'VE READ AND LOVE ALL OF HIS BOOKS..BUT FRIENDS AND LOVERS IS MY ALL TIME FAVORITE.."
4,Friends and Lover,I thought this was a great book to read. I always enjoy reading Eric J. Dickey's books. Once you start this one you don't want to put it down.
2,"Thin, Predictable Plot & Terrible Ending","This book opened with great promise. I hoped the leading male character would continue to explore his past for insight into his relationships with women. Instead, the chapters droned on with the same kind of excessive-adjective-use, name-brand product-advertising, and unnecessary-sex that has kept me away from most of the modern African-American fiction writers. Oh well...back to the classics."
5,Just one of Dickey's OUTSTANDING Books!!!,"I had never heard of Dickey before my girlfriend showed me Milk in My Coffee. That was also great. Friends and Lovers had me in tears. The characters are so real and you find yourself in some of the same situations, maybe with different outcomes. I was unable to put the book down. The way he described each intense scene made you want to hurry and get to the next page and see what was happening."
4,AWESOME!!!!!,"""Friends and Lovers"" definitely shows the growth of Dickey as a writer. It is mature, insightful, passionate- just awesome. My sister and I have read this novel and enjoyed many lengthy conversations; especially about Shelby, Richard, and Tyrel's thang. ""What is up"" with that? The book was an emotional rollercoaster, especially what happened to Leonard. But who says that life isn't always flowers and candy. Even though Shelby got on my nerves, I loved her anyway. It is apparent that Dickey took efforts to make this story real. I thank him for allowing me to know Debra, Leonard, Shelby, and Tyrel while taking the chance to visit with Chiquita once again. I laughed and cried as I learned lessons I'll never forget. ""Milk in My Coffee"" is definitely on my list for September."
3,mediocre in the genre,"I loved ""Sister,Sister"" and could not wait to read ""Friends & Lovers"" so I ordered the hardcover. I could not have been more disappointed with my decision to do that. I got over the way the chapters are set up for a different character first person to the point of always wondering who was speaking and I still could not get into the characters because there was nothing to get into. The relationships jumped from situation to situation .. . I ""missed"" a lot of moments that I felt was vital to the story. When Leonard asked Debra to marry him, I was not there. I was there when they talked about doing it but not when it happened. The same with Shelby's abortion, I was not there. I could go on but I think you get the picture. I will wait for the paperback of your next venture.. . maybe a sequel to ""Sister,Sister."""
4,"I agree with reviewer Christina Menard of Houston, TX","This book was riveting! It reads like a movie waiting to be made. Interestingly enough, I also saw the young woman that plays on ""For Your Love""----just last night------and I thought, ""That is Shelby""! It would be a shame not to make this book into a movie. I had trouble putting the book down. I do agree, that in some places, you got a little lost as to who was telling their version of the story, but that was a minor problem. This book was anything BUT boring!"
5,Dickey Has Really Outdone Himself,"""Friends and Lovers"" by Eric Jerome Dickey is a sensual tale of the lives of four people: Debra, Shelby, Tyrel, and Leonard. Once you pick this book up and begin reading, it's hard to put back down. This book is filled with drama and suspence from beginning to end. If you have ever been in love, you will find yourself laughing out loud and losing a few tears. The words truly jump off of the page and into your life. Erick Jerome Dickey has really outdone himself with this book. It can only be called a Literary Work of Art."
5,maaaaaaarvelous,"I first read Cheaters and I was so overwhelmed by Mr. Dickeys work that I went out and bought all of his book. I read Sister Sister, Friends and Lovers, and I've just finished Milk in My Coffee. I get so caught up in the characters it's crazy. All I have to say is mover over E, Lynn Harris, there is a New Sherriff in town."
5,Great Energetic and Suspense,I enjoied reading this book. It reminded me so much of me and my cousin. I or shell I say we related so well with this book. I read this book in three days.
5,Best novel I've ever read!!!!!!!!!!!,"Eric does a great job of relating to male/female relationships. I cried, laughed, and totally related to my sistahs in the book. I constantly had to look at Eric's picture on the back of the book to believe that a man wrote this book and related so well to black women. I'm still in search of my Tyrel!"
5,Impressive! I could relate to every character.,I have never encountered a male author who could write women so well. This book captivated my attention from jump street. I could relate to almost every situation in this story. I have read it four times already and find something new in each reading.
5,Good read,Attention to many common questions and easy to read. Can be a good reference as well as an introduction to serious study for a beginner.
4,"""Answers to the Questions You Have and Those You Did Not Know to Have""","Some of the questions that Bickel and Jantz answer in this book are questions that have been asked since the beginning of Christianity: Why should we suffer for Adam's sin? What is the right way to worship God? Why does God allow children to suffer?With amazing patience and respect, the authors simply answer the questions asked by adults and children. Scripture backs up each response. Each response is brief. The answers are what you would expect from mainstream Christianity.Then, there are the more complex questions: Do blacks and whites see God differently? What about Roman Cathoicism? These testy questions are answered in such a polite, yet direct manner.To get real answers to Bible questions, read this book. Anyone of any age will find it helpful on their Christian walk."
4,Nooks and Crannies,"Having multiple copies and just about every conceivable arrangement of his father's works, I decided to take a stab at CPE's own prodigious output and jumped in at volume 11 having heard one of the tracks on a radio program.First rate musicianship, but alas, the music itself is not quite up to his father's impossibly high standard--what composer's is? I do hope that the label puts out a compilation or highlights disc for this series because CPE Bach was a gifted composer. If you need to be able to lay hand on anything written by CPE Bach and to the extent a series may be judged on one volume, than this is a must buy. However, this reviewer finds J.S. Bach's oeuvre quite enough for several lifetimes and doesn't yet feel compelled to complete the Bach family collection."
1,Amazing!,"This is a volume with definitions of most statisticalterms. Some are missing, such as:Definition of chutzpah:someone who asks 4000 dollars for a 9000-page encyclopedia which was obtainedby asking hundreds of statisticians to volunteer sections forfree.Definition of mensch:someone who writes surveys on his field of expertise andplaces it on some web site for the whole worldto enjoy.Luc Devroye, Montreal"

2,Get lessons from a pitching instructor,"I bought this thinking I could teach my daughter how to pitch. There's so many things that affect a pitch that aren't covered or only touched on. The kid in this video obviously already knows how to pitch. You can get a few tips on how to pitch, but you're only going to be a little better than someone who just swings their arm in a circle and releases the ball. My advice is to save your money, find someone who teaches pitching, and spend your money there. My daughter learned more in one lesson with a live coach than watching this video several times, writing down what should be done, and analyzing the pitcher's motion in slow motion. A coach can give you immediate feedback, corrections, and drills to improve your pitching. Save your money on these videos. (I bought a couple others and never got my money's worth out of them.) Sorry Ernie."
3,Effective but difficult to assemble/use.,"This bike is a good workout. But, it was very difficult to assemble and is hard to use to maximize the benefit. The monitor is powered only while you're peddling. So you have to peddle while you lean forward and try to enter your settings. I haven't mastered that yet. It's also extremely heavy so it's difficult to move."
2,Very bad recording!!,"You'd think with today's technology that they'd be able to make this CD sound better. The vocal tracks (except for ""Santa Claus Is Coming To Town"") sound like they're coming from the bathroom down the hall. There's an echo-y reverb that gets annoying before the first track is done. Also, the ""I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus"" track is actually sung by Bobby Helms, not Bobby Sherman! This CD would actually be good if it had been recorded correctly to begin with.Track listing:1. Christmas Wish2. Blue Christmas3. Jingle Bell Rock4. Yesterday's Christmas5. Christmas Is (Make It Sweet)6. I Saw Mommy Kising Santa Claus - Sung by Bobby Helms7. Christmas On Her Mind8. A Song Of Joy9. Santa Claus Is Coming To Town10. Love's What You're Getting For Christmas"
1,Horrible reissue of a decent album,"This is a horribly mastered, shoddily packaged reissue of most (not all) of the songs from Bobby Sherman's original 1970Christmas Album. And, yes, as Mr. Reilly suggests, one of the songs isn't even by Bobby Sherman. Seriously, I've bought thousands of albums in my life, and this is absolutely the biggest rip-off of them all."
1,Hey Little Sherman?,"What was Bobby thinking, allowing this to be released? This recording sounds terrible. I'm glad I didn't pay for it. If anyone wants one, find me, and you can have mine."
3,Bad sound,"The model is so nice, but the sound...it's ugly!!! You don't expect that sound, doesn't correspond to the image of an HD motorcycle!!!"
4,KNG HD Fat Boy Phone,This is a nice phone but would be nicer if it were cordless. Of course the only reason a corded phone was purchased was because it is a HD Fat Boy Replica.
5,NIGHT LIGHT,Outstanding product and great value. Purchased as a Christmas gift and the recipient loved it. Would recommend it for gifting or for keeping for oneself.
5,Cute...,Love this nite light! I think it's sweet and nice light for my bathroom. Very pleased with all the Ibis & Orchid designs!
4,CLASSICAL MUSIC,this was a brilliant hardcore him song and i think you should buy it just to listen to it once because even if you don't like it you will always have a special place in my heart!
3,Fascinating,"Plods along till page 180, then gets very exciting. The beginning chapters have WAY too much personal narrative and introspection. The book suffers from what I call, ""The Blah-Blahs."" Reading all that ""what this quest means to me"" stuff is plain old dull.BUT.The final 140 pages overcame the poor start and proved un-put-down-able. I enjoyed it very much and have recommended it several times. Chiasson makes a cohesive, coherent, and compelling case that there was a civilization there.Is there any reason to explore whether it might not have been a Viking civilization?"
1,Sloppy scholarship,"I am an ethnic Chinese from Java, Indonesia, where Admiral Zheng He actually landed; that historical fact is backed by written gazettes by Chinese historians and archeological artifacts. Not this book. This book is full of pure speculations. The photo examples that the author gave to compare clothing costumes between the Chinese and the ""early settlers"" are not even Chinese. They are Manchurian, who occupied China as the Qing dynasty, hundreds of years later than Zheng He's time (oops, sorry, wrong dynasty). This book was given to me as a gift. I expected it to be at least entertaining, but it is so sloppily written and researched that it's not even worth your time."
5,wonderful,"Great discovery book and warm human story of the author and his family.This book made me up for all 13 hours flight to Seoul from DC.It reminded me of the fact that History is not just past, but your viewpoint, angle and something you have to work for.Thanks, Mr. Chiasson."
1,Public deception by Random House and Mr Chiasson,"The work ""Island of Seven Cities"" by Paul Chiasson suggests the existence of vestiges of a 15th-century Chinese settlement on Cape Breton. The complete fiction of these claims are demonstrated by detailed rebuttals here: www.1421exposed.comThe publishers Random House Canada have published this fiction as non-fiction with not one effort at verification of the claims within. They have in effect colluded with Mr Chiasson in deceit of the public and there needs to be public censure of such publishers who engage in such deceit with complete contempt of the public's interest."
1,No sure what to believe,I book leaves me wondering. Dont buy it. I saw on the website its all FALSE.
4,Boy versus Girl,"My husband and I both read the book. I thought that it made a lot of valid assertions, however, I am not as aggressive or progressive, I guess as many of the women who were interviewed. My husband loved the book. So, I intend to read it again. I do think it was valuable, and worth the money, but I wish it had spent more time on people who are in committed relationships...perhaps this is the NEXT book topic!"
3,ok,"Denene Millner, and her husband Nick Chiles gives us their opinion on todays' relationship. I would have liked the book more I think if i was more out there, like the situations in the book"
4,Hallelujah Slide track review - haven't heard entire album,"I haven't purchased this project, but I heard the Hallelujah Slide on the Gospel Music Choice channel on cable. It was cute...enough for me to actually look it up on Amazon.com. Not so crazy about southern gospel, but I definitely intend to purchase that track. Cute, fun and different enough to put in the playlist for Christian social events. Title made me nervous that it'd be corny, but I found the actual song pretty clever."
2,The Bare Minimum,"The back of the dress is pink. It does not match the front which doesn't make any sense.The wig would be great if they actually had hair on all of it! The wig hair stops about halfway (moving from forehead to mid-head). In other words, if you're wearing this wig you look completely bald in the back.Overall, the maker of this product neglected the back side of the costume. The back of the dress is pink and the back of the wig has no hair on it."
2,"Disappointed, but you get what you pay for","That says it all, you get what you pay for. The dress is so thin you can see right through it. I will not be wearing the wig, it is going in my child's dress up bin. I guess it was worth the money just to be able to have a start to Sally's dress, I will be modifying this like crazy because it's not wearable as is (if you want anything other that a cheap last minute costume).Hey, shipped fast though!"
3,Good costume horrible wig!!,"I actually purchased the sassy sally, the costume is ok but the wig, well, it stinks. In process of sewing in more red yarn. its hard to belive that they would make something so screwed up but here it is in front of me. Its like only 1/3 of it has yarn, so you look like a balding sally, not cool."
5,Great,"Just as decribed. Thanks so much, my daughter loved it and she got so many compliments on Halloween. It really made her night."
1,Don't buy this--is all pink in back and cheap,"I returned this outfit. The wig, as mentioned in another review is not full, and the cap is small. I do not have a large head and could not put it on. The outfit is completely pink in back--it does note have the same pattern as the front. The material is very thin and shiny--not very Sally-like at all."
2,Nightmare Sally costume,"This is a very simple costume and I ended up cutting it up to make a pattern to make a real costume. This is a nylon print sheeth, comfortable, but just not up to my standards for a costume. The wig is a cotton cap with some very red yarn sewn to the center, very cheezy and not attractive. Sally is one of my favorite charactors and the costume was a disappointment."
4,postal,"This movie was a definite classic. You can see how the movie industry has evolved in the making of sci-fi movies, but all in all this movie is right up there with the best of them. I really enjoyed this and would recommend it to any movie buff."
4,A classic science fiction movie from this time period,The plot was pretty much what one would expect. Ther special effects while not always the best did have some high points. I feel these type of movies are more entertaining when you relize when they were made and just sit back and enjoy the movie. I own a copy of this movie and would recomend it to anyone who might think of buying it.
2,It Came From Beneath The Sea,"At first I thought this was going to be a great DVD. But even though the feature to toggle between color and Black & White is a great feature,it leaves a little logo on the screen at all times, right over the movie itself, just like those logos on TV channels. It is very distractingand extremely irritating. There is a black band at the top & bottom of the screen which it would of fit into, but they have right over thefilm itself. Wish there was a way to make this disappear."
3,Yeh gimmee a QUINTOPUS to go and hold the fast forward?,"Modern technology and super low 'Zon pricing combine to make this a welcome addition to your HARRYHAUSEN Chronicles. Yes, the modern technology is the remote with its 'fast forward'feature. You can plow through the interminable talking heads , all the while supplying your own dialog from all the times you saw it on commercial TV (and didn't we SCOUR the TV guides, hoping against hope, in those days?). My favorite shot has to be the poor people pulped by the Giantentacle as they foolishly try to flee along Battery Street! Remember Forry's homage to Ray from 'Famous Monsters of Filmland'-long about Issue #5? He'd recommended the cinemagician to a guy producing a monster flick who gulped, ""He charges ten thousand dollars a tentacle!"" No wonder ""IT"" had only five! So buy it already for ten QUID!"
3,If you lived in San Francisco.....,"and were about 5 years old (as I did and was) when this movie originally came out you never traveled across the S.F. Bay Bridge without holding your breath for as long as you could praying that you'd make it across BEFORE the Beast through it tentacle over the exact spot you were at on the bridge! By today's movie standards, it a simple ""B"" movie -- very lotech and maybe even cheesy, but way be fore it became fashionable, it had a lot to say about what the nuclear tests and waste products of the day could do to living things --"
2,Only thing good about it were the monster scenes.,This film could have been better if they had more monster scenes.Harryhaussen did a good job with the effects but that was about all I liked about it.Another thing is this monster died to easily.Godzilla could have taken lots of torpedoes and he would have been hardly scratched but the giant octopus in this movie died after being hit with one lousy torpedoe.
2,It came from Beneath the Sea,"As a fan of the 50's SCI-FI movies and Kenneth Tobey, I was disappointed in this movie. It had a shallow and predictable plot, not much in the way of special effects and chemistry that just plain didn't work very well."
4,ILHM Reviews: It Came From Beneath the Sea,"After his atomic submarine is attacked by a giant octopus, Commander Pete Mathews sets out to stop the beast before it can destroy all of San Francisco! IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA is the second film to feature the amazing special effects of Ray Harryhausen. Although the plot is little more than a rehash of earlier Atomic Age horrors like THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS, it is still competently played and never ceases to impress with Harryhausen's stop-motion animation. The film's signature scene involves the creature's attack on the Golden Gate Bridge. It has also become infamously well-known for Harryhausen's cost-saving techniques in giving the octopus only six arms instead of eight. Scripted by THEM's George Worthing Yates and starring Kenneth Tobey from THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD, IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA has all of the right elements for a successful Sci-Fi adventure!-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"
2,"YEA, IT CAME FROM BENEATH SOMETHING",I love the work of HARRYHAUSEN but this just wasn't up to par with some of his other films. I didn't really feel the atmosphere this movie was trying to go for. 2 stars just for HARRYHAUSEN.
4,Harryhausen the special effects wizard of the 1950s,"As mentioned in some of the other reviews, Ray Harryhausen's special effects are the real stars of the show. One of my favorite scenes is when the octopus pulls the ship under water. Determined, it tugged and tugged until enough water had flooded the freighter so that it would go under.The final 20 minutes of the movie are done well and keep you on the edge of your seat as the octopus reaches out from the harbor looking for a quick meal. The people getting crushed under one of the tentacles is very convincing.A classic sci-fi movie from the 1950s. I have seen and recorded a number of them, and this is among the best. Solid script that doesn't drag along, and great special effects."
4,"Best practice tests, but found an error","I am a private math tutor and author of Math Study Guide for the SAT, ACT and SAT Subject Tests: 2012 Edition. Although there are only four practice tests in this book (two for level 1 and two for level 2), they are the best available. I usually have students start with practice tests from third parties such as Kaplan and Princeton Review, but always have them finish with these tests.I found a mistake in problem 37 of the second level 2 practice test. The page number varies depending on what printing you have, but the tests themselves did not change. The problem uses the triangle inequality, which states that any side of a triangle is strictly less than the sum of the other two sides. The solution to the problem is wrong because it uses less than or equal to rather than strictly less than. So for this problem 7<(b-a)<17 which means that there are two correct answers to the problem, either 5 or 7."
3,SAT Subject Tests,"I expected the book to be a little bigger and with more practice tests. There was a small tear on the front cover of one of the 2 books I ordered. In the end, the books were helpful in my tutoring business."
3,Disappointing,"Unfortunately, this book only has two practice tests. It is really tough to adequately prepare for this exam with so few problems. I recommend Barron's book instead."
3,Pretty Good,"The new Math Level 1 and 2 Book is not too bad. However, it is overpriced. This book is the same price as the SAT book with all the Subjects. Just because it has the answers explained does not mean it should be this expensive. I recommend buying from Amazon, since they significantly lower the price by about 30%.I took the Level 2, so I do not know what the Level 1 was like. In actuality it only has one test for each; the second one they give is in the old SAT Subject Tests book (the one that's Red, white and blue).This is a good supplement to Barron's. I took Math Level 2 the first time in October for a score of 720, then retook it in December and got 800 with this book and Barron's."
3,"Good, but only after a solid review of the material","This book is great if you need self-confidence.In fact, the real tests are much easier than in any other preparation textbook I've used (Barron's, Kaplan, Princeton,etc). However, it's certainly not enough to ace the SAT.I advise you to first work on ""hard"" tests. Even if they are not similar, they still give a very stable amount of knowledge. Then, pass the ones in this book only to have a good idea of what to expect on the actual exam. A month or two depending on your math level will allow you to prepare."
2,Not very useful,Not very useful if you want to study for maths level 1/2.only useful for part time end moment practice but not worth its money.
2,NOT REALISTIC!,"This is one of the workbooks my daughter used to prepare for her SAT subject test in Math Level 1. Although she did well on the real test (760), she didn't find this book particularly helpful because the 2 tests provided were overly easy and don't resemble the difficult problems that appear at the end of the real test. She finds Barrons and Kaplan books more realistic in that they reproduce problems closer in difficulty to those found on the real test."
3,Disapponted,"The content of this book is exactly identical to the official guide to all subject tests. Little did I know I'd be burning money by buying this. While it does contain an extra test for each paper, it is hardly worth the money.Better to get the Barron's or Kaplan books rather than the College Board stuff."
4,The Official SAT Subject Test Study Guide,"A necessary evil these days, preparing for the SAT Subject Tests is much easier with this book. This is the Offiicial Guide, written by the people who wrote the test, so it's the closest to the real test day. My daughter takes the tests this Saturday--fingers crossed!"
2,ONE OF AEROSMITH'S WORST SONGS,"THIS SONG WAS JUST STUPID AND DUMB. AND IT JUST DIDN'T ROCK. I'M ONLY LETTING THIS SONG GET BY WITH 2 STARS BECAUSE IT'S BY AEROSMITH, ONE OF MY FAVORITE BANDS. OTHER THAN THAT, THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST SONGS THEY DID IN THEIR ENTIRE CAREER!!"
5,A great set of stories Well Told,"I have listened to this CD numerous times. This is a spoken word CD with background music and sound effects. Calvin Davis has captured the essence of a frog in love and seeking his fortune in the world. This CD is about a frog that can say his name in ""human talk"" ""Chauncey Chauncey Chauncey"". Thorough Calvin you meet Chauncey, his friends, his family and his environmentally sound human family who are the protectors of Chauncey's pond. This is a great gift for all seasons. I am giving this CD to my 8 year old neice for Christmas."
4,Fairly good page burner,I enjoyed this read - the author is great at quickly helping you connect with the characters. You somehow naturally fall into interest and then outright concern for the characters. The storyline challenges taboos in light of love to the point you might find yourself urging the characters to ignore taboos and accept their destined love.
4,Secret lives,I enjoyed the book as the plot hooked the reader and the character descriptions were really very good. It is an exciting novel.
5,Very good read,"Enjoyed this book thoroughly! This book started out a little slow for me but had lots of twists and turns. Unfortunately, the ending was a little predictable but not how the author brought you to the end. Very clever and poignant story."
1,Did Not Like,"I read this book based on all the positive reviews. I have never read a Diane Chamberlain book. I am sorry to say I was disappointed. At first the story captured my interest. I just did not like Eden or Kate at all; therefore could not give the book a fair shot. They were dysfunctional and pathetic in my opinion. I also did not like some of the subject matter in this book or some decisions the characters made. The author's style of writing flowed well. I guess I just could not be objective with this book. Perhaps if I were moved at all by reading this book, I would be able to give more stars to this review. However, the only emotion I had while reading this book was disgust. Instead of feeling remorse or sorrow towards the characters, I felt no emotions at all. Not sure if I am willing to read another book by this author."
3,Disappointed,"This book was definitely a disappointment - very much like a daytime TV soap, complete with just enough sex to fulfill the formula. Predictable plot and preposterous lead character. I won't be reading any others from this author."
5,Enthralling,"This book draws you in from the very beginning, in the middle you start to think you know how it will end, You don't!The story weaves magic and you will find yourself drawn into the lives of each character forming distinct opinions about each of them, loving some and others not so much. Your emotions will be as one with those of the characters so artfully created."
4,Secret Lives,Diane developed her characters so well that you could not wait to know what they were going to do or how they were feeling. This is one of those books that make you ponder for days after.
4,secretlives,This is the first book I've read by this author. She came highly recommended by my colleagues. This book was very moving and I was never exactly sure what was coming next. Very well written. I am sure I will read more from Diane Chamberlain.
4,A great weaving tale,"A great read, many items intertwine, it will hold your interest from beginning to end, i am ready to read another book by this author."
2,Difficult,Something is wrong with the print as it isn't lit up. It started out correct but didn't continue beyond the first few pages.
3,Not a bad read,"A well written book that seems to suck you in. Follows the lives of a family who find themselfs in unusual situations. A book of Trust, Love and Secrets."
2,why all the 5s?,characters are so fake and storyline so predictable....with the great reviews I didn't expect it to be nearly as boring
4,loved the journals,"For the price, the book was worth every penny. The journals of her mothers life made the book, just loved those characters. The story outside of the journal was a bit predictable and paled in comparison to the story within the story, but definitely worth the read. I will remember her mother for a longtime."
5,love,I love this book! The characters are stunning and unforgetable. I was hooked on this book from the beginning. I will remember these people and places for a long time.
4,Good Book,"Got it at a reduced rate. Definitely worth a read. I don't think I'd have liked it too much at regular price, but at a reduced rate, it was pretty decent."
2,Boring,I found this to be rather like a serial in a magazine. Predictable and boring. Nevertheless I perservered and finished. Would not recommend.
5,Great for couples!,"This is a good deal. Two of the DVDs are for women and two are for men, but all four made enjoyable viewing for us as a couple. Each DVD features instructional information, interviews with real people, and hot sexy scenes with good-looking real-life couples. It is obvious the couples care for each other and are not just porn actors. That made a big difference for us. This is a great tool for any committed couple - and for singles as well!"
2,Meh...,"I thought this would be good for my wife and I. Well I was wrong. This is just porn, and bad porn at that. The people in it are unattractive and actually turned us off with the bad acting. Get yourself some real porn if that is what you are looking for. If its is help you want, then this wont help there either."
2,There is better material out there...,"These videos must have been shot in the late 80's/early 90's. This set is full of bad acting, not very attractive actors & actresses, and the information found within can be discovered for free on countless websites on the net. My wife and I actually laughed while we watched the videos and were unable to take any part of them seriously. There are better instructional video material out there for your hard earned dollars."
3,Cute. Sometimes insightful. But sometimes pretentious.,"The pictures are cute, and mostly seem to fit the aphorisms that they're paired with. Some of the aphorisms are deeply meaningful, highly insightful, and very thought-provoking. Others are, at best, pretentious. (""Whatver interests, is interesting."" William Hazlitt) (Well, DUH.) Overall, I've just never been impressed with Zen. I'm just too middle-American white-bread, I guess. But the book's worth a look for the cute pictures, if nothing else."
4,Great Product - BUT IT WAS EXPIRED!,"Bene-Bac is a five star product for it replenishes the necessary bacteria that birds need for good health and is veterinarian recommended. However, the product I received expired August, 2010. It has the same Lot Number and Expiration Date that Diane reported in the previous review. Surely the stock people at Amazon could take a few seconds to check the Expiration Date before shipment.I called Amazon and they are refunding my money. They said a stock check would be made to remove any additional expired product. Because this is such a great product and the money I paid for it was refunded, I give this transaction four stars."
3,You better be able to use your legs!,This product is fine if you can use your legs. There is an upper body part but it is short and a lot of leg work is included. Not good if you are in a wheelchair and paralyzed like me.
2,Light workout,I found this workout very light and a minimal workout. If you want to burn calories I would recommend Chair Boxing or Chair Salsa instead of this dvd.
5,bellydance-chair aerobics for everyone,this is a great dvd for exercise that is different and fun. It is a very graceful type of dance that is very benefical.
5,Mystery Heaven,"What a treat to have some of the worlds favorites sleuths such as Miss Marple, Hercule Poirot, and Colonel Race all in one collection of eight mysteries. And Agatha Christie doesn't disappoint with exciting mysteries such as Murder in Three Acts, The Man in the Brown Suit, Murder is Easy, and Thirteen to Dinner. It's a pleasure just spending time with some of the great actors that have given so much pleasure to so many over the years such as Helen Hayes, Peter Ustinov, Olivia de Havilland, Tony Curtis, Jean Stapleton, Bill Bixby, Tony Randall and so many more."
2,Horribly remade,"This is perhaps the first time for me that Amazon reviews have been totally amiss. This series is a set of poor adaptations of the original christie novels, which are set in 1930. The sets are cheap, the actors second grade and stellar performers like Bette Davis wasted in guest roles. The only saving grace are Helen Hayes as Miss Marple and Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot. Most of the episodes drag unbearably with lot of drama, no music or slickness in direction and no real backbone to any character. The David Suchet series is highly superior and worth keeping compared to this. Am waiting to get rid of my set, total waste of money."
2,Agatha Christie Mystery Collection,"These 8 made for TV films are among the weakest modern Christie offerings. Any of the PBS versions are preferable. Ustinov makes a silly Poirot in 3 of the films, Helen Hayes is a passable Marple in 2 films and plays a brief role in a third one. The Man in the Brown Suit is fun, but fluff. Christie fans should look elsewhere for satisfying film versions."
2,Chill bumps--from horrid retro 80s pop culture,"I know we have been spoiled by David Suchet and the period filming, but these are extremely dated--with poor acting to boot. Poirot is a bumbling buffoon. It was a waste of our money.The only one that half way kept our interest was ""The Man in the Brown Suit.""Conservative viewers BE WARNED: they were trying to stretch whatever immodesty that they could get away with on T.V. at that time. A number of scattered scenes and wardrobe items were complete voyeurism.I love Agatha Christie, but these left me chill bumps of revulsion rather than excitement."
1,Not worth it,"Sorry, but the more recent Agatha Christie's in the past 10 years are good, these were corny and badly scripted, but good casting. However, not worth watching, as I turned it off as we just couldn't agonize through it all. I'll probably give them away to someone less discriminating. I'm a prude!"
1,I dislike these movies!!!!!,These are the worst Agatha Christie movies i have seen. I did not want to even give a star. i WOULD LIKE TO GET my money back if possible. I cannot bear to watch the rest of them. They do not have the class as the other movies have . I will ONLY WATCH THE first type of movies i brought with Hercule Piroit as the leading person. Money wasted.
4,AC CLASSIC MYSTERY COLLECTION,"This collection is a must have for a true AC Fan. All the usual suspects we try to catch on TV but end up mising them, due to their TX times, are here. Some are far better than others - hence the rating I have given the collection. It would have been nice to have a few extras on the DVD's, but you cant have everything. Hours of sheer magic and suspence."
4,Camp but fun,"It is vintage Poirot and Marple, but such fun, including seeing stars like Anthony Andrews David Suchet in supporting roles. Who remembers that David Suchet was not Poirot? I certainly didn't."
3,Oldies but OK,"Peter Ustinov is way too untidy to be Poirot but these stories are good none the less, if just a little bit long winded. I still prefer Joan Hickson as Miss Marple too but since some of these haven't been redone, they're good to have in the collection. They stick fairly close to the book, unlike the new 'Marple' abominations."
2,Use Caution,I got this with the anticipation of seeing some of the better actors/actresses who've played Agatha Christie's characters on screen. I was very disappointed! The films were poor quality and poor adaptations of Ms. Christie's stories. I re-sold it as soon as I could.
3,Always fun - not the best,Lovvve Agatha and all the movies. That said this collection is not standing the test of time BUT is a joy to watch for it being a Christie collection.
1,not worth its money,"This so-called ""tourist map"" is so old that it already drops dust when you take it off the shelf in a bookstore. In Mexico it's not even available anymore. One-way streets marked in the wrong direction, tourist information booths that don't exist anymore (and missing new ones), or pedestrian areas still shown as thru-streets are just a few examples of the many mistakes this antiquity has. Better buy other, more up-to-date tourist maps that earn their name, available in Mexico City at many newsstands, at Sanborns, or bookshops."
2,"General, yet interesting.","While this book is exceptionally general in its treatment of such a broad topic, it may still find a place in the interests of readers unfamiliar with the subject matter at hand. The tone is certainly approachable, and a lack of technical or academic language makes the contents easily graspable. Yet the book is wanting in its lack of detail and depth: at best the reader is left wanting something else -- and while this may, perhaps, have been the author's intention, it certainly poses a substantial flaw in the final outcome."
4,The human art of seeking,"What makes this book unique (and an uniquely excellent read) from among the many intellectual histories out there is the perspective from which Boorstin approaches his subjects and the aspect of his various subjects which he focuses on. Rather than looking, as most intellectual histories do, at what the conclusions, ideas, and dogmas of their various subjects are, Boorstin instead examines the act of seeking itself. In the process, he introduces us to the means of seeking answers to life's greatest questions as they have been applied by some of the greatest seekers of history, from biblical figures like Job to Greek philosophers like Plato to modern day scientists like Albert Einstein. Boorstin's work is a masterpiece of appreciation for the amazing capacities of the human mind and the restless nature of the human spirit. His book is a paean to humanity."
2,Found: A disappointment,"Having enjoyed ""The Discoverers"" and then a bit disappointed with ""The Creators,"" my expectations for ""The Seekers"" were mixed. I was hoping to read a description of the historical development of philosophic ideas. Unfortunately, I found ""The Seekers"" to be a disappointment. It is not clear for whom this book is intended. Philosophic schools, historical and social trends, and the people who sought truth are described in brief and somewhat disconnected brush-strokes. Most disappointing is the apparent inability of the author to shed a narrow focus on people and their times (often with idiosyncratic and not always relevant pieces of information thrown in) and not place ideas and works in a broader social and cultural context. Without other knowledge, one would have a difficult time understanding the importance, and particularly the historical consequences, of the ideas that are described."
2,An Esoteric Sound Bite,"Frankly, to attempt to present even an admittedly brief history of seekers like this volume is nearly blasphemous. This is the fast-foot, USA Today version of the history of seekers. This was not a whetting of the appetite for more--this was inappropriate. This is like the Reader's Digest Version of the Ring of the Nibelungen or the Eroica Symphony. To hear only the first minute of the first movement is less than a insight. It is, like this book, a meaninglless waste of time. I can find little good to say of this supeficial survey. In its attempt to ""accessibility,"" it presents unsatisfying fluff. Some things, i.e., the history of thought, must not be reduced to bathroom reading. With his other more ample volumes, what happened here? Did the author run out of time? This is consumerism at its worst."
3,the weakest of this set,"i loved discoverers, liked creators, got bored by seekers.a rela let down.still, it is a good book and there is great stuff here but, i expected a lot more."
2,Disappointing after Creators and Discoverers,"I've read and re-read The Creators and The Discoverers. Maybe my expectations were unrealistically high for The Seekers. The relatively slim size didn't bother me; I trust Boorstin's scholarship and assumed that he simply stopped when the material was covered. However, my impression is that for some reason the author or the publisher needed a book in this niche in time for the holiday market, and rushed this one.In the Discoverers, Boorstin's powerful use of language enhances the flow of ideas from one seemingly unconnected concept to the next, along with a thrilling feel of mystery. In The Seekers, rolling tides of majestic adjectives seem a little empty and pompous. Maybe I needed a little more, or a little less, eggnog."
3,liberal and communist ideology,A Valuable introduction to some of the foundations of liberal and communist ideology.
2,Bad,Dolph never was an actor but he is still a S... Kicker. I had a difficult time counting the number of people he killed or broke their arms.
3,Lundgren is Hitting his Prime.,About halfway through the movie I thought it was going to be like a Rocky movie and I do believe it had that potential. But somewhere the potential was lost. Maybe it was when the lead character had sex with his ex-wife before she checked on the well being of her daughter. That's something that absolutely wouldn't happen in real life. I was a little disappointed that the potential was lost.
3,"Fun space opera, but beware Pyramid 1967 printing","This is a decent space opera, with bizarre aliens, rocket ships and ray pistols, treachery and revenge, and a large scope (entire planets are at the mercy of the invading aliens!) Jack Williamson is a solid pro, with a smooth writing style who includes a good amount of both psychological terror and comic relief without going overboard in either category.I read the 1967 Pyramid paperback (x-1634) with the charming green Jack Gaughan cover. While the cover is easy on the eyes, the text is full of typos and printers' errors, which is pretty annoying. I have not looked at other editions since I was a kid, but I am going to guess that other editions will be less irritating to read."
4,"A great ""how to"" dvd for healthy eating!","First let me say that Dr. & Mrs. Fuhrman are not professional entertainers, so this dvd won't appear like a show from the Food Network. But they demonstrate how they make some of their favorite healthy meals and they give tips on preparing larger quantities so you have food ready in the fridge when you get hungry (to keep from being tempted to munch on unhealthy snack foods because better choices are not at hand). My wife and I enjoyed the dvd and have already prepared the stir-fry (big hit), the hearty vegetable soup and the kale. While the recipes require a relatively large number of ingredients, the results are pretty impressive. It's a wonderful help for enjoying the journey to better health!"
4,Eat to Live cooking class,"This is not of the caliber of the Food Network, but it is charming and informative. It was enough to get me convinced to start the ETL program, seeing that it was not that difficult to prepare. I will admit I also bought the VitaMix blender after this as well -- I was amazed at what they were able to do with whole veggies -- even more than my food processor. But then, I am a kitchen gadget junkie! Back to the DVD, interesting recipes included and demonstrated -- a great accompaniment to the book, Eat to Live."
4,Dr. Fuhrman's DVD,The DVD had helpful ideas but many of the ingredients are not readily available. I had to search the internet to get some of the stuff he uses in the DVS.
3,Nothing here that's not in the books.......,"This really wasn't what I was expecting. It's not a very helpful addition to the book. What it does confirm is that while the dietary concepts may be valid and workable, the kitchen techniques and food combinations are pretty sad and uninterresting.I would suggest any number of really outstanding vegetarian cookbooks before any of Dr. Fuhrman's. It seems he's in it to sell his own special products and recipes."
2,Fuhrman's home movies,"This DVD was not what I thought it would be. The title says ""Secrets to healthy cooking"", well . . . they're still a secret. What the video amounts to is an unscripted amateurish display of Joel and Lisa Fuhrman preparing their favorite dishes. Most of the recipes are concocted in a blender or VitaMix, with the Fuhrman's usually forgetting to mention all the ingredients in the recipe. The recipes are never repeated at the end of a presentation so you have to rewind to make a note of what was included. There is none of the in-depth explanation for combining foods, or heating vs. raw foods, that I was expecting. The recipes are no doubt healthy and tasty, hence my two stars, but the DVD was not especially informative."
4,Gave as a Gift,"While I have most of Fuhrman's titles in my personal library, this I gave as a gift to a family member who really needs to learn the material. That family has now begun having daily Green Smoothies, and I think this contributed to it. I also gave them ""Disease Proof Your Child' and ""The Adventures of Mitch Spinach"". God Bless Joel Fuhrman!"
5,Thank you,"We eat to live every day and love knowing weare healthy and full of energy, and in our latefiftys too!"
1,Saturday NIght Live Skit,"This was the worst video I've ever seen. It was like watching a video for Bass Masters on SNL. The presentation was so amateurish and the stories were so lame, I was embarrassed that I bought it. Seriously . . ."
3,"Wonderful cards, BUT....","Wonderfully useful cards, lovely design, and so forth. Very potant when used as a clarification to a Tarot reading. I once read a friend of mine a Celtic Cross spread and though I'm rather good at Tarot, he wanted clarification...so I pulled these out and they really helped him, and they help me a whole bunch as well. The art is simply beautiful. Well done:)Here comes the ""However"".HOWEVER.I wasn't quite as fond of the book, passed whatever page it was that taught you how to use the cards themselves. Sorry dude, you came off as a bit Ego-centric. No offense!I'm not wonderfully adept at Astrology and would love to learn. Perhaps I'll give the last chapter another try.Goddess Bless,~Astarte RoseWillow"
5,Excellent Learning Tool!,"Having taught astrology for the last 10 years, I have found the Karma Cards to be an excellent teaching and learning tool which promotes a deeper understanding of the Science of Astrology. This oracle remains one of the most user-friendly decks I have ever owned, giving direct and practical advice to the querent pertaining to immediate action and/or outcome of any given situation. This oracle can help the querent specifically look at several proposed plans of action and their subsequent outcome before choosing which will be most to their liking. Lastly, the art images are a stunning representation of traditional astrological imagery. An excellent addition to any collector, novice, or wisdom seeker."
5,Every Woman's very do-able workout,"I loved BOdy Change but found the workouts weren't always convenient for the amount of time they took. I loved Body For Life because it gave me an alternating schedule for workouts but 6 days a week was just too hard to maintain.Wini has taken the best of her last book and made it do-able for the average woman. I'm a working mom and now have focus in the gym on my 4 days/week schedule. Not only that, it's so effective and a great powerful use of my limited time.The stretches are an added benefit and as I'm learning from my mom, an essential thing for women to practice to aid in aging without pain. These workouts are completely balanced and the stretches just reinforce the time we need to focus on ourselves.I highly recommend this book and can't wait to see the long term results. Thank you, Wini!"
3,Great for beginners/intermediates,"I'm not sure that this book is for the individual who is already in shape. I have been working out for years and even while using heavy weights, I did not feel like I worked my muscles sufficiently. I also felt like some muscle groups were left out in the advanced portions. I do agree with the other reviews about the great production and instruction."
5,Great M. S. Classroom Resource,"Found a copy of this book at the used bookstore. It looked like a good resource for my 7th grade students. Largely Hispanic, good comprehension skills, their limited vocabularies handicap them in reading and writing. The students actually fight over this friendly and informative resource, even choosing to read it during free choice reading."
4,A view from a non-fan,"Since the only other review of this book is by a professed Thurber fan, I thought I, who had been relatively unaware of Thurber's work before reading this book, could write a helpful review. It is basically a series of portraits of people that were either important in Thurber's family history, important in Columbus, Ohio from the 1910's to the 1930's, or his journalist friends from Columbus. Thurber had a subtle sense of humor, and he uses it to full effect in describing the sometimes outrageous activities of his subjects. The anecdotal history of Columbus that is slowly revealed proved to be quite interesting (I'm a native of central Ohio).Each chapter did end on what at first seemed to be an overly sappy note; however, this is understandable since the book was first published in the early 1950's, when such things were probably expected by Thurber's audience. Overall, this was a very fun read."
2,"Nice idea, doesn't clamp on firmly.","If this clamped on firmly to the table top, it would be very slick. As it is, it hangs loosely."
1,Do NOT waste your money!,"Typical Belkin junk. I just got this home and tried to ""clamp"" it on to several different thicknesses of wood on my desk. This thing flops around like an old man's johnson. The clamping feature is useless. I'm taking it back to the store tomorrow."
3,Beautiful,This ring is stunning! Looks even better than the picture. My only complaint is a diamond has already fallen out. I've only had it a few months. I always take it off when doing dishes etc. Disappointing because I love it so much. If someone comments on it I always make sure that part of the rings isn't showing.
3,"Early Thunder, Book Review By Me","Early Thunder is a book about a boy grwoing up right before the Revoloutionary War. He is a Tory, which means that he supports the King and British rule.Daniel West, a 13-year-old boy, is a loyal Tory with a father who happens to be a doctor. He has a little sister and brother, and a best friend named Beckett Foote.Daniel watches as the events that lead to the American Revololution take place. He questions his loyalty to the King, and in the end, shows whom he supports loud and clear.I would recommend this book to people who are interested in The American Revolution. If you aren't, you probabaly will be after reading this book. It has a lot of historical facts and places, plus some not so important events. If you combine these, you have a very cool historical fiction book."
3,Early Thunder- Read it or Kick it?,"Early Thunder is a book about a boy grwoing up right before the Revoloutionary War.

If you aren't, you probabaly will be after reading this book. It has a lot of historical facts and places, plus some not so important events. If you combine these, you have a very cool historical fiction book."
3,"It's okay, but I wouldn't recommend it.","Early Thunder is about a boy, Daniel West, who is caught in the middle of the battle between Tories and Whigs during the American Revolution. It wasn't the best book I ever read, and as another reviewer mentioned, it has a slow start. The book is mostly centered on Daniel's personal conflict, so if you are looking for action, you won't find it here.Besides that, the book was okay. I guess I am a little miffed because I have to do a project on the book (LOL), but I wouldn't recommend it. People interested in the ordinary people of the Revolutionary War might enjoy this book, so don't let my opinion stop you! A friend of mine read the book and throughly enjoyed it."
1,LONG UNDESCRIPTIVE BOOK,"I thought the book moved very, very slowly. I like action, adventure, and/or survival books. This was not any. I don't read much and this is the kind of book that makes me not want to read. I read the back, looked at the cover, and thought it had to be one of those. I thought Daniel would run into trouble more than he did. I thought there would be more action and excitement. The book isn't even a good for telling you what it was like in the 1800's. The book didn't go into enough detail in anything (except that new governor.) I would suggest pick it up from the library, and if you really do like it then buy it."
2,Extremely boring most of the time. Fair plot.,My 6th grade class read this book in school and I must admit that no one thought highly of it. It was unbelievably boring and the plot wasn't great. The teacher didn't think it was a good book either and in the end we agreed that Jean Fritz has written better books. If you are looking for a book on the Revolutionary War I'm sure you can find better than this.
2,A slow and boring story!!!,"In my opinoin, this book is a poorly told and poorly sturctured novel about the Revonluntionary war. Although I'm sure many people enjoyed this story, I found it slow and pointless. Also, the plot was hard to follow. The end of this novel was bearable, but I strongly recommed that you stay away from this book."
5,Great Movies,"If you are a fan of Agatha Christie, Hercule Poirot, or Peter Ustinov then you must have this item. All of the movies are amazing. And no one plays the role of Hercule Poirote quite like Peter Ustinov!"
3,away with hastings!!!,"the three poirot films in this collection show a sharp decline in budgets from the previous ustinov poirot stories. as they were made for TV is easu to explain. there are some excellent performances, especially tony curtis and faye dunaway. the annoying character is hastingd as played by johnathan cecil. he's a complete ass, and should be in a PG Woodhouse book, the silly twit! ustinov had the role down pat by the time these were made. the three stories will keep you nicely occupied. of course none have the style of the DAVID SUCHET tv films."
4,funny thing,"i love agatha christie therefore i love everyrthing agatha christie, but i love hercule the most. peter ustinov is so perfect as a poirot. and helen hayes is just lovely as miss marple. i don't like the new ones in the british series, esp the guy who played poirot. but this dvd is for collection. i'll buy again and complete the series."
4,Hercule Poirot DVD,"Peter Ustinov is the best portrayal (my opinion) of Hercule Poirot. This particular DVD set is from the TV series, as you can tell from the periodic (commercial) breaks though they are done as fades. Set in the 80's and with less buget than the movie versions, they are still a pleasure to watch."
1,Warning: Poirot is out of place in the 1980's here!,"I'm a huge Poirot fan and thought that I was open minded enough to see Agatha Christies' Poirot in any sort of reputable production. I like variety. But this ""variety"" was too far afield. The entire setting made no sense to me. Poirot set in 1980? The foundation of Poirot's character has no place there (nor in this production) Great actors (expecially when David Suchet plays Japp in Thirteen at Dinner) set in a production that is so horribly flawed I will never watch again. I hate to even give the DVD's to anyone. What a waste.I wish I had believed the other reviews saying this before I ordered. Warning, this will ruin your immage of the Agatha Christie Poirot. It will."
3,An unlikely Poirot,"I agree that the production value and the music scores are top notch in these made for TV releases. Ustinov, while engaging, is nobody's idea of Hercule Poirot. Still, ""Thirteen at Dinner"" and ""Dead Man's Folly"" which also features a great Miss Oliver, played by Jean Stapleton are certainly worth a watch. ""Murder in Three Acts"" is so unremarkable that I am surprised they even released it on DVD."
4,"Not the ""complete"" collection!","This does not contain two wonderful espisodes, Evil Under the Sun and Death on the Nile. It's great to see more of Peter's portrayal of Poirot, but to the unintiated, they would miss some great Ustinov acting.Be sure to check out ""Agatha Christie Mysteries (Death on the Nile / Evil Under the Sun / The Mirror Crack'd) (1978)"". Although ""The Mirror Crack'd"" isn't Peter, the other two are the movies I reference above. Check'em out!!!"
1,A silly waste of Peter Ustinov's time and talent.,"Hrcule Poirot acted by David Suchet is so far superior than the Peter Ustinov's portrayal. He had a silly accent; David Suchet as Inspector Japp was terrible and while the whole thing I think was meant to be tongue- in-cheek, their tongues should have been bitten instead."
4,Fun Films!,"I enjoy Ustinov's work, and particularly his Christie stories. I found a certain loss of charm in this particular collection due to a kind of modernization. The period aesthetic was missing in at least two of them. Nevertheless, I will watch them repeatedly (mostly because I enjoy watching Ustinov). Thanks, nick"
5,Finally Stress Free,"I am finally stress free as I have been looking for this collection of movies for a least 4-5 years, as every place I attempted to help me find or order them gave me the run around or supplied me with information which resulted in nothing, so I finally gave up. Thank you Amazon, I can now live a stress free movie life as I enjoy my collection. The product arrived in good condition, and the quality of the dvd's was excellent, and I will be using your services again."
5,Wonderful!,This album is nothing but a masterpiece. A must have for anyone who likes Brazilian music.
5,Meant To Be,A book by an author that makes you want to hurry to find out the future and read slow to make it last.
4,"interestng characters, interesting plot","I have purchased almost all of Edie Claire's books because she usually has well-developed characters dealing with realistic conflict, and the ending is almost always satisfying. I enjoyed this book, and, as usual, sat up way too late reading it because I HAD to know what was going on. It was fun, kept me interested, and had a satisfying ending. That said, I'm thinking this is one of Edie Claire's early books, because the main character, Meara, is a tad stereotypic, the plot that has everyone an adoptee is cutesy, there's no explanation for why she and I just couldn't believe the whole bit about inheriting the entire mountain top. Maybe I've just developed a high level of cynicism over 36 years of working as a mental health counselor..........I dunno! I want to emphasize that I liked the book overall - it is well-written and satisfying - just a bit too coincidental in some of the plot."
4,Meant to be,A well written book. You will enjoy the read from the beginning to the end. Read this author. You will enjoy her work
3,Are we at the end yet,"The story line was good, but way to much detail on little things in the book that become pain stakeingly boring."
3,Meant To be,"Fun, easy reading story. Some romance, but nothing overdone. Will probably read others. Would recommend it to anyone looking for an easy read.."
5,awesome,I've think the music is unique and beautiful. My seven year old loved the music too. So fun for her to dance to. Music for kids but I find myself singing along.
5,Talented new author shows her talent!,"Lynda Sue Coopers, Unguarded Hearts is a story about Nina Wild, an ex-Secret Service agent, trying to prove herself as a professional body guard. The body she's guarding belongs to Mitch Halloran, a pro-basketball coach who is being stalked and isn't especially interested in being guarded. A whodunit that leaves you guessing wrapped up in a love story that is sure to touch your heart. Lynda Sue Cooper is a new author who's moved onto my auto-buy list!"
3,"Good, bad, but not necessarily ugly","I liked this movie since I first saw it too many years ago. I had an old VHS copy that was in poor shape that I would watch whenever I needed a little cheese. You know, bad dialogue and questionable plot. I always liked the music and the racing wasn't bad, although much slower than the real thing. I knew there was another ""european"" ending and this DVD has it. I wish I had never seen it. The other ending takes a tolerable bit of entertainment and turns it into crap. I would guess that the makers didn't know how to end it so they did this.What a waste. Unfortunately both endings are here but you have to watch the european version as the American endind is just tacked on afterwards."
5,Exactly what my husband wanted.,This is an old movie about motorcycles and my husband had looked for it for years! He has ridden motorcycles for over 30 years and loves this movie. Product arrived on time and in good condition.
5,I have been looking for this dvd for years,I use to watch this movie all the time on cable back in the 80s. But i forgot the name of the movie. I figureed out one of the actors names Beau Bridges. and did a seach on his name and found the moive.this is good underdog moive and motorcycle mouive
2,Silver Dream Racer,"This is one of those movies that you can tell while watching it, that you know you're seeing something bad. But I continued to watch. Only to be completely ""blown away"" by the horrible ending. What a waste. I basically watched the entire movie to get the big race at the end, and I'll admit that I was slightly more interested in the characters at this point, so what do they do? KILL the star, and thus, the relationship with the girl. If your into torture, or a laugh then rent it."
4,A quick and easy way to hang your flat screen TV,I needed a way to mount my flat screen (32 inch) in our motor home. I chose this mount because I liked the way it looked. It's tough and heavy duty. It work just the way I was hoping it would. It was easy to install and functions well. I would recommend this mount
3,"Great product, horrible directions.","I was so excited to get my first wall mount for my flat screen until I opened the box. The directions were a nightmare, so many extra nuts and bolts! Other than that I cannot complain!"
4,very usefull resource,"This book contains a lot of useful information as far as basic nutrition provided in a format that is easy to access and comprehend. It is not going to give you a quick fix or magic cure, but instead reinforces the concept of treating the whole body nutritionally to attain a balance. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in health and nutrition and would like a reference tool."
5,Excellent,This book is an excellent overview of natural methods to assist the healing process. An excellent read!
4,"good shape, useful book","Received the book very quickly, it was in very good shape - like new. Did not use it much lately, but think it could be really helpful. Thanks"
4,One for the Library,"I have always used Prescription for Nutritional Healing as a reference book and this one is the perfect companion. The only problem I have with it is the assumption that everything has a remedy. I prefer the holistic view that encompasses the entire person and use the remedies as ""tune-ups,"" rather than as ""the answer."" Great reference book, but again, I prefer ""Forget the Cures, Find the Cause,"" both books to really get started at being well and then referencing this book for finer details."
4,Great Resource!,This book is definitely a good catch. Very informative in alternatives to natural remedies and in explaining the symptoms of each. Very good book.
2,"Some good advice, but also some bad","This book helped me diagnose my candidiasis about 9 years ago so I'm grateful for that, but now that I'm much more of a critical thinker and more educated I know it has some bad information in it as well.It promotes homeopathy throughout the book which I'm passionately against. Homeopathy is not supported by scientific evidence and isn't even plausible so it wouldn't even be good speculation. It also has minor mentions of reflexology and other dogmatic advice which would waste someones time when they could be trying a proven treatment.So instead of weeding through the bad advice in this book, I would just recommend getting another book, such as my favorite: Health and Nutrition Secrets, by Russell Blaylock M.D. Dr. Blaylock doesn't just give you advice but also the reasons why and the evidence to support it."
4,Leading edge comedy,My jaw dropped the first time I saw this show. Hysterical send-up of Tori Spelling's career and publicity. Interesting take on reviving and surviving Hollywood celebrity. Wish there were more. and ZACHARY QUINTO!!!!extra plus: fat dog!!
4,Too bad it didn't last longer.,"A cute show that was yanked off the air too soon. Tori Spelling basically makes fun of her life for laughs. She figures everyone else makes fun of her, why shouldn't she? You'll love her little mental flashbacks to her younger years that make her the way she is. Her memories of Shannon Doherty are hysterical! Loni Anderson as her mom is great. I can understand why her real mother wasn't so thrilled with her ""role"" on this show. Her friends are funny and make her look like the normal one. Check it out!"
5,hilarious!,I bought this series because i love tori spelling and i wanted to see another side of her besides he one in bh90210. I love bh90210 and so i thought i would buy this and check it out. It's so funny so far and im on the 4th episode. I wish it went on longer than just a couple of episodes though. check it out if u love comedy and tori spelling :)
5,great series!,"So NoTORIous is a funny sweet series! Zachary Quinto plays her gay friend so well. He is very funny, witty, and has great comedic timing. Not to mention his good looks! This show was rooted in reality but has a spin on it. They have exaggerated and embellished her real life stories and friends. This show is very enjoyable. The DVD has bloopers for every episode and has many deleted scenes as well as having included an extra episode previously un-aired! I would recommend anyone getting this series whether a fan of Tori's Zach's or just feel good comedy!"
3,worth the price,"I'm a huge ZQ fan. Just love the guy, so when I heard he'd done this series with Tori, I picked it up.Imagine my surprise when I discovered the show was pretty good. Considering it was done on the cheap, the episodes mostly all work. The ensemble cast plays well together and all get their moments to shine.Now...how good is Zach? Huh. Very! He's the reason I bought this DVD and he will be the reason I watch it over and over again. Sasan is a hoot. ""I'm Iranian, Muslim, and gay. All my personalities are at war with each other. It's amazing my complexion is as flawless as it is.""Zach rocks this character, and he's in every episode but one. So worth it!If you get this set, make sure and watch the outtakes; they alone are worth the price!"
4,this show should get more credit,"i think that because of everyone's previous feelings about tori spelling clouded the greatness of this show. which is sad, because in reality it's clever and funny.when it first aired, i wasn't one of those people who had any preconceived feelings toward miss spelling. i didn't like her but i didn't hate her.but once i saw this show, i really loved it and one day wanted to purchase the dvd set.so i was in blockbuster and the whole season pre-viewed was in this discount bin for just $3.99! score!i'm sooo glad i bought it, too. it's hilarious and you get outtakes from each episode!! it's wonderful!!"
4,TORI-ific ! Comedy is where this woman belongs!!,Even if you hated her acting on 90210 this is NOT what you think.This is extremely hilarious and I just can't believe they didn't pick it up for a second season. I wish they would pick up another season. Please please VH1
3,Kinda disappointed...,"When looking for a watch box, I really just wanted a sleek, black leather box. I didn't care whether the leather was real or fake. This box is REALLY textured. I know that the description says textured, but not only can you see the creases, but they're light blue/white in color. I wouldn't have minded so much if the box was completely black. I wanted something modern and the color definitely does not fit the bill. It reminds me of acid washed leather x_x"
1,Not What We Were Expecting!!!,"Our local children's museum is hosting a Magic Schoolbus exhibit just in time for our daughter's birthday. We wanted to play the theme song for background music so we purchased this cd. It's NOT Little Richard singing and not the version our child LOVES. All of the songs are done by the same person. I will give them credit for annunciating and making the lyrics clear unlike the originals but they should make it more clear that that is what it is. Through the laughter, my husband summed it up best, ""It's like we're at a class reunion at a Holiday Inn w/ a cover band."" Now, none of those things are necessarily bad it's just not what we wanted or expected. Be forwarned!"
5,Wow,the definitly best song on this c.d. is the last song. PERFECT WORLD. Miss Mikalah Gordon sings it wonderful. She is ONLY 12 at the time! She recenty was on American Idol.. (Season 4 this year)... and placed 11th... she's amazing. I recomend buying this c.d. b/c of her and b/c her dad is very talented also.
5,A great buy,Mesmerizing. An uncomfortable subject finally considered. A must have for Civil War buffs and at a very reasonable price from PBS
5,Death and the Civil War,"Just yesterday on our PBS station I caught this program entitles Death and the Civil War. I found it informative, interesting and heartbreaking. I heard about things I never knew before. I am now purchasing it for my home library. This is one that our kids studying the Civil War should see."
1,Total dud of a book - don't waste your time with it,"Very predictable, poorly written, with the only half-decent lines in the book stolen straight from Fight Club. I paid $2.00 for this book from the bargain bin, and after reading it felt as though I had paid far too much for it.I would absolutely recommend NOT reading this book - watching paint dry or grass grow would be preferable."
5,Informative,This book gives a very good historical analysis of the Phoenician people. The book also offers many insights into the people the Phoenicians traded with. There is quite a bit of interesting history in the book such as the trade and alliance between the Egyptians and the Phoenicians. The information seems to be well researched and very well presented. The book brings history to life.
2,Dodgy...,"'These sea-traders supplied the Minoans on Crete, and competed with the Mycenaeans of Greece.' Surely it is the other way around...? If this is the quality of the review it does not say much for the book."
4,A fascinating narrative,"Sanford Holst has created a fascinating, accessible, and intriguing narrative of the Pheonicians. It explains how the success of trade and the necessary inventions, including the alphabet, developed in the civilizations in the Mediterranean. There were many peaceful people and tolerant societies in the ancient world, including the people of Malta, Crete, and Phoenicia. Since that is different from Roman culture, however, some people prefer to say Phoenician society could not have existed. This book shows there were several different cultures at that time, and we can learn from each of them."
2,Drama-mentory,"This is more in the vein of Sharon Kay Penman's triology (Here Be Dragons et al) of early Wales/England. Sadly, it is not quite as well written as that.In spite of this being my grandfather's heritage, I could not maintain my interest in continuing reading. It would have been far better to present the actual known facts and how it is that we know these facts (i.e. what evidence exists to support it).Perhaps, one day, someone will actually write a history of these worthy people. This just isn't it."
2,nice,I like this camisole. It is soft and sweet looking. I thought the price was a bit high for what you get. Fit true to size.
1,Cuddly Duds Camisole,"This is NOT the product I thought I would get. The material is too heavy with a nylon knit on the outside and a cotton weave on the inside. The lace is not the one I expected, it is also too bulky. I am looking for a ""finer"" material as I had bought before, but perhaps Cuddly Duds does not make them that way anymore. 20 years ago they produced them of a jersey type knit with a very pretty, light and expandable lace top. If they produced that type again, I would certainly purchase it in quantities. But this is not what I was looking for."
1,It never arrived to my home,"I bought this book, then I recieved an invitation to review this book, but I can not do it because the book never arrived to my home (of course they took the money out of my credit card). I guess I wil have to buy it somewhere else"
3,Pyrex Dish,"Love the shape of the dish and good size but lid is so tight, I always have to ask my husband to help open it."
3,Not worthy of the money,"it's hard to tune in and out to shorten or extend the legs, and when you hold the camera, you don't want to get your hands dirty by holding the legs which may stick into the dirts to tune it back in. also, it's not always tuning the far end first then the upper ones, so it's awkward once a while."
3,Too Expensive,"I own the MS reader version, which I bought for [money] or something. The story is usual JB, and it definitely steams, but there is no way I am going to pay [money] for the book. I would have given the book 4 stars, because although it's good it isn't the best JB I have read (I own all her books), but the price is way too much. If you can still purchase this book in eformat do it. The entire book is is probably less then 120 pages. Ask yourself if you want to spend [money] on that!?"
4,Pleasant Surprise,"I say surprise because I never knew Alan Titchmarsh was a writer. I loved his television show ""Ground Force"" (wish I could get that on DVD). What a lovely story is ""Rosie"". I can hear Alan's voice as I read it. Well done and most enjoyable. I look forward to reading his other books now."
2,Ruby In Paradise,"It Isn't The Sellers Fault, but The DVD ""Ruby In Paradise"" Looks Like It Was Filmed Off of TV, Kinescope Style, and Then Processed........Very Poor Quality DVD.."
5,theres nothing like a good small film,"Amazon's review pretty much says it well: this is a extraordinary film, and Ashley gives a star making performance. So why isn't it on DVD?!!!"
2,A Slice of Life,"A quiet, unassuming film about a woman searching for her identity. The film is about ordinary people in ordinary circumstances which does not make for exciting cinema. Judd gives a fine performance but I found myself bored with the story. It moves slowly with little drama. This film is too much like everyday life. Not very entertaining nor enlightening."
5,Ruby in Paradise,"One of the best films ever! A classic, with Ashley Judd, Wow! I recommend to buy, but dont play, DVD is worth more than seller is selling! Great deal!"
5,Ashley Judd at her best,"Too bad she never has anything this good since... Guess she chose to be a star rather than an artist.This is one of those low key, low budget indie film that manages to grow into you if you allow it with open mind and patience. It's rare gem hard to find anywhere these days. Guess Ms Judd wised up after this film and decided to dive into the big money pit only to support her other priority - charity. She's in it for real and never looked back. I also loved her small supporting role in ""Heat"" (De Niro and Pacino). She is one of those rare actor/actress who leave deep imprint long after the movies finish. Memorable..."
4,myself surprised,"I have enjoyed reading Alan Watts' books and listening to his taped talks. He is my favorite philosopher. I was quite startled to learn that he had such an addictive personality. He overused both nicotine and alcohol. The fact that Alan Watts had substance abuse problems doesn't reflect on the wisdom of his teachings, but it does raise the question as to the value of these teachings to positively effect a person's life. Obviously, these teachings did little to help Watts. His early death at age 58 could be considered a deliberate suicide through the abuse of the legal drugs nicotine and alcohol. The author may have sensationalized some parts of Watts' life, but I believe that his private excesses have been well documented elsewhere."
2,Apathetic and disappointing,"Both my parents work in the ER so I've heard ER stories all my life and I know that people who work in ERs have ample justification for discontentment. That said, I was repelled by the apathetic way Dr. Grim dealt in her book with her disaffection from emergency medicine. If there is a problem, why not directly address it as Dr. Pezzi does in his book ""Believe It Or Not! True Emergency Room Stories""? Furthermore, Dr. Grim does her readers a disservice by leaving us hanging at the end of the book. She spends countless pages describing the rationale behind her exodus from American ERs, and then . . . nothing. In her afterword she gives updates on some people mentioned in the book, but curiously she doesn't utter a peep about the central character in the book: herself. That's inexcusable given that the main theme of this book was that she was burned out and was trying to figure out what she should do with her life."
5,Just here trying to save a few lives,"This was an excellent book, great material and well written. You could actually put yourself in the authors shoes."
2,Thin Fabric,"The product arrived in a timely manner. The fabric of this shirt is very, very thin. You can see thru the material. I have only had it for 3 weeks, so I will see how long it holds up to washing."
1,wrong computer,Not the computer advertised. I has a slower processor. It came with no power cord. It didn't come with the advertised keyboard.
2,We'll See,Has't arrived yet even though it was ordered over three weeks ago. Still waiting too see what shows up. Hope it's worth the wait.
3,Loved it but hated it....,"This machine was a beautiful piece to our living room, was super fast, just all round fabulous until one month following the warranty these vertical lines started appearing on the screen one at a time until the screen was no longer useable. Myself and some 5000 other people (on an on-line petition that I participated in) had the same issue and the Apple technician that I spoke to stated that they knew nothing about it. The machines manufactured in 2006 were affected by this defective display issue. The part to repair is $724. My advice for anyone purchasing this unit is UNLESS IT COMES WITH EXTENDED WARRANTY STAY AWAY!!! I have since purchased a 27"" iMac and a MacBook Pro and both are great."
5,"Apple iMac Desktop with 17"" Display MA590LL/A (2.0 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 1 GB RAM, 160 GB Hard Drive, SuperDrive)","Computer love!!!!! Say what you will about your pc's... and I own both... when it comes down to it, you can't beat a Mac!"
1,I just receive it and i had a problem with the logical mother board,"After 15 days that i received my imac , i had a problem with the logical mother board, then i shipped it to apple warranty repair office and after 12 days fixind my machine at the Oficina Eletronica in So Paulo and $80 spent wiht freight, i received my imac , but this time with another problem. I'm trying to contact apple in Brazil to figure out what i should do to get the machine working fine."
4,The Big Change over,Hard to convert from Microsoft Windows XP over to Apple's system. It's entirely a different system.Other then that it's OK.
5,A MUST FOR ANYONE INTO HOLISTIC AND NATURAL LIVING,"This book has changed the life of my family and I. I help further our journey towards a totally natural and holistic life, for your spritual, physical, and mental body."
4,Heal Thyself,"Most of the information was repetitive, It gave a lot of information on fasting. It was a source that I could incorporate in my quest to be healthy. Heal Thyself, something we could all use."
5,Excellent Book for improvingyour physical & spiritual health,"We at Fibroid News thoroughly recommend this book to our readers. It is a refreshing book, that makes the journey to optimum health an enjoyable one. Queen Afua expresses words of encouragement and positivity throughout the book with simple fruit and veg diets to improve the body. I followed the book and I feel great. I would recommend this book to all women and men."
4,Stainless steel value,"Looks great in the kitchen with the other steel/black components. The dial (rather than number pad) takes a bit of getting used to but works fine. I love the popcorn button! It cooks fast. We moved from an 11-year-old Sharp carousel R-230 rated 700W -- but this Panny cooks in about 2/3 the time with only 100 watts more rated power. We have 1000W Sharp microwaves at work and this is just as fast. I think Sharp overrates their magnetron power output. Only quibbles are: power cord attaches to the underside front right, so it is more visible than I'd like; the green LED display could be brighter; its made in China so long-term reliability is a question mark. For the money, though (under $100) this is a handsome, powerful unit. Great value."
2,The devil's in the details.,"I find two things about this microwave very annoying on a daily basis. There is no number pad on this product. Any time I want to enter a number, whether it is setting the clock or entering a cook time, I have to turn the dial. The dial seems to work: 10 sec, 20 sec, 30 sec, 5 minutes. Come on guys; how much money did you save by eliminating the number key pad. Second, the glass plate has three notches to synch up with the gizmo that turns the plate. However, the gizmo has only one element. Therefore two of the plates notches are not aligned with anything, which caused the plate to slip and clunk until the parts line up again. It appears to me the manufacturer has done minimal cost reductions at the cost of customer satisfaction."
4,nice choice,"it works well. A little bit noisy, but it's supposed to be when working!The light is a little bit dark, but still enough to see.Enough functions.It looks pretty cool ^^ especially for modern kitchen."
3,A little problem but its alright for what we do,My wife uses it to mix and knead the bread it works great for that. I used it the other day in the cook cycle and the fan for the convection oven sounded like it was hitting the shroud housing. It was a factory rebuilt unit and I guess they missed that part. I will just live with it because the mixing part is great and we cook our bread in the gas oven.
2,Refurbished may equal used,"I thought this was a great deal. I thought refurbished meant in very good condition, just slightly used at most. The one I got was scratched all over, and bread crumbs were visible in the crevices. I promptly returned it, and after reading more negative reviews about this product, bought a Breadman Pro. We are extremely happy with the Breadman Pro."
2,A Disappointment,"Made by Cuisinart. Must be good, right? Like the Sham-Wow! guy says, ""We all know that Cuisinart makes good stuff"". Except this one does not work well for baking simple loaves of bread. My trusty Hitachi HB-B301 had a broken drive belt, and as Hitachi stopped making this item a dozen years ago, supplies of replacement parts dried up a half dozen years after that. So I bought Cuisinart. The whole concept of its system is different. Two paddles instead of one, a horizontal loaf rather than a vertical one (looks more like the loaf you'd buy at a bakery), and a zillion options to do all kinda of fancy things from fruit cake to jam, but the bread it what I got it for. And the bread was a disappointment."
2,Defective Baking cycle,"This is a convection oven bread machine, which is great! Accept the baking times in the programs are for traditiuonal ovens. So any thing prepared that requires baking will be burned if you allow the program to complete. You need to terminate the baking cycle 10-30minutes early. The items still does all other functions well. Please keep these coments in mind before you decide to purchase this unit."
4,Great for the money I paid.,"I got this from Big Lots (same factory reconditioned model) for a bit less cost wise. Anyhow, the first one ... the paddle kept turning after it should have (had to unplug the machine). So, Big Lots replaced the item, and the new one works fine. This has a 90 day warranty from Cuisinart as well. Anyhow, for the money I paid, I cannot get one near as nice as this one is, that bakes the loaves as evenly. I have to alter the recipes, and it still does a great job when I use a combination of rye, potatoe, and soy flours instead of any wheat, etc. Personally, I love the looks, but I bought it for the functions it does for the cost. I really can recommend this machine. I would just wait for it to get to $80 or less is all."
3,Cuisinart Bread Maker,Very large for the average kitchen. Requires constant attention to add ingredients and remove kneading paddle at appropriate time.
2,Hard to read,"I found this book to be difficult to follow. It's not just the text and layout, but the book just plows into technical detail with little regard for what makes sense or what is practical. In some cases the book goes too far into scripting with little regard for the fact that this is an Acrobat book. It tends to get lost in the technical details, making it hard to see the forest through the trees."
1,The book is terribly poor,"I agree with the guy that rated this book only one star. If I had the opportunity I would have given less than one star. There is nothing in this book that has not already been covered in other books of econometrics. You want time series? Buy Hamilton. You want panel? Buy Baltagi. You want statistics? Buy Mood.I only got a big confusion going back and forth between chapters.If you need a list of references on each topic, ask your econometrics instructor and save the money of this book."
5,Shadowland,I loved the Spider World series. I loved it so much that I hunted down a book that was out of print so I could complete the series.
2,Only two of the dvd's feature Miss Marple,"This box is a bit of a trick. I really loved two of the movies on this 3 dvd box set. Helen Hayes is great as Miss Marple.Caribbean Mystery was my Fav.The third movie Murder is easy has Helen Hayes in the first five minutes of the movie and NOT AS MISS MARPLE! Unless you are big Bil Bixby fans this movie is not for you, THE STORY DRAGS ON AND ON. BY THE TIME THE MYSTERY IS SOLVED YOU COULD CARE LESS. The BOX lies. big surprize a movie studio is trying to screw you. Only TWO dvds feature her. If you can buy the first two i would do that. IF I HAD KNOWN BETTER I WOULD HAVE."
3,Good but not the best miss Marple,This was a good attempt at an American Miss Marple but there are so many British examples that are far better. Not bad but in all things Marple I would leave it to the Brits.
4,JUST AS I REMEMBER THEM,"Helen Hayes was wonderful as Miss Marple, but I was dissappointed in the episode where she only appeared in the beginning! This was the way mystery stories used to be told. No blood, no gore, just ""mystery"" to try to match wits with the characters in the story. Helen Hayes was perfectly cast!"
2,not what I expected,"I must say, that these movies were not what I expected. My family and I are great agatha christie fans, but were disappointed in these productions. We didn't even finish watching Murder with Mirrors. Murder is Easy was the best of the bunch, but Helen Hayes plays just a small bit part right at the beginning. All in all, these were a disappointment."
2,Disappointing,"I love Helen Hayes and I love Miss Marple Mysteries, but this set was so disappointing. It reminds me of the typical 80s B rated movies. Maybe it's because I'm glad the 80s are over, but this series just seemed boring to me."
1,HARDly misleading...,"Just to clarify....this movie available from MKS studios is not the movie about a gay cop and cruising serial killer. This title is actually a soft porn production with many attractive, non-starpower names/bodies. Not bad for what it really is, it's just not the movie that it seems to be when searching for the movie HARD directed by John Huckert (released in 1998) starring Michael Haboush, Noel Palomaria, Charles Layner, & Malcom Moorman. Don't find this out the 'hard' way, make sure you are getting the real title you want."
3,A bit disturbing....,"A very dark and violent movie. There is no Hollywood happy ending at the end of this one! What is bad is still bad, and there wasn't much good to begin with. The movie deals with the homophobia that a closeted cop faces while trying to find a deranged serial killer. The story is complicated by the fact that he slept with the killer; who is now trying to frame him for the killings.This movie isn't for the faint of heart or anyone who has the slightest problem with homosexuality. The violence is graphic and disturbing, and there is a lot of male nudity (and not just NYPD Blue rear views either). However, the characters are engaging and are the real focus of the movie!Stereotypes (we have seen the killer before in movies like Cruising) and formulas (closeted cop is outed while trying to solve a murder) aside, this is a good movie worth owing - or at least watching!"
1,not the movie i expected,"what I thought i was ordering was a sundance introduced murder mystery based on the premise of a gay detective having to 'come out' while trying to solve a series of 'gay' murders. the movie dealt with the harrassment he faced on the job. This was NOT that movie. This was a soft core porn movie, made up of a few trailers and teasers. Not even well done. I would suggest taking this out of circulation, since it is basically a promo tape."
5,Amazing,This product does exactly what is says it will. I used it to hold an exercise mat to a carpeted area. It actually stays in place throughout my work out. It even held up when two young boys were wrestling on it. Just what I was looking for.
4,Great DVD that breaks down the swing,"This is a great DVD if you're looking for ways to break down the softball swing, and ways to coach girls into doing those things. Things like turning their hips, ""squishing the bug"", keeping their hands back, etc."
2,Will lose suction from smaller shields.,"Some suggest that the bigger the better, so I got this size. I am a D cup with nursing and a C before. The one that came with my pump seemed way to small, so I got the biggest size based on reviews. It works better, but I'll have to get a smaller size. Using this size seems to drasticly reduce the amount of suction I get with my manual hand pump. Too bad you can't just buy one to try it!"
5,Nothing to complain,"They didn't have is size at babies r us so I had to order it, they're great. They fit well and they're comfortable"
2,Sexual Secrets Review,This collection comes on ONE DVD and has an irritating intro that you cannot skip each time the DVD is viewed. It is a marginal to poor DVD unless you are a beginner in the area of sexuality.
2,Disappointed & Amateurish,"I am a Mike Dooley fan however this DVD was terrible. I don't like to use the word ""hate"" to describe anything or anyone or I would have placed 1 star as a rating. The camera angle was annoying, his joking was annoying and the DVD was amateurish.The message he is trying to get across I don't believe he ever did and I didn't get anything from it.Unfortunately, this DVD seemed more like a commercial to let the world know that he writes ""messages from the Universe"" and his goal is for everyone to receive it. I'm over exaggerating a bit but if this was the one thing I did remember from it than that is telling.I would expect this type of DVD to be produced by a person who doesn't have the funds to produce a quality presentation.You may get more out of it than I did so if you like Mike Doole you should buy it and come to your own conclusions."
2,not a strong point for Naipaul,"I am a huge fan of V.S. Naipaul. The premise of this book--exploring the effects of the colonial situation upon the lives of three men--is excellent. However, this book is a confusing conglomeration of three separate and unrelated stories, and there were times when I found myself wondering what was going on. I love Naipaul's flair for narrative and description, but the sections on Miranda are almost entirely dialogue, with lots of obscure references. I actually skipped over the last section on Miranda because I just could not get through it, whereas normally I am unable to put down Naipaul's books. Not one of his best works...in fact I don't recommend it to anyone aside from those hardcore fans who are determined to read everything this great novelist has ever written."
2,Not a bad book...just sort of 'scattered',"To borrow the authors' own words...this book is a slippery piece of work. You slip about and lose your footing. It's nice and easy and clear and brilliant for many pages...then, you suddenly feel you've not been paying attention. The author would say those periods are precisely the places you (the reader) have to identify as that is where the writer decides to add and hide things. The book is VERY well written. I learned a lot from the historical aspects of the novel. There are four intersecting stories going on in this book and I think four separate EXCELLENT novels would have been a better arrangement. It does assist in telling you that 'I have to discover myself again'. And it profoundly hints that success comes from a little good luck, talent, knowledge and prestige. I also laughed when I read a line in the book: 'You are tormenting yourself needlessly' as that was how I felt at certain moments of reading this novel."
2,It was barely watchable,This movie featured some good actors operating with a poor story line. It was tedious to watch and I waited for something to redeem it. But it didn't happen.
4,Surprising,"For the first half hour or so, I didn't think I'd get through the whole movie, but I'm glad I did. It really surprised (and even shocked) me so that I changed my opinion of it. I ended up really caring about each person and was happy they remained friends. Don't watch this movie if you expect great acting and/or story lines, but if you can overlook it's flaws, this movie does deliver. I am sure I'll watch this one again.Originally I chose to watch it because I absolutely love Montana, and the scenery definitely is incredible! For that reason alone, it's worth watching!"
3,Pyrex,"It's great that this set has covers however, the cover on the square pan makes it too large to fit into a small microwave. It is convenient that they can go from a microwave to fridge to dishwasher. Covers also seem very sturdy and seal well."
3,"Product works perfectly, but the price is outrageous after seeing what's in the marketplace","Short and sweet, this bucket is a great product, performing great, looking great, and rolling around just as it should. However, early on I fell for the same thing I know a lot of detailers to when expanding their business, and thought somehow this was special enough to merit the price tag. You can get any 5 gallon bucket for pennies basically at many stores, and the ""grit guard"" which is meant to separate dirty water with dirt particles from mixing with fresh water (to hopefully reduce marring and swirls in the paint) are a nice addition, but not entirely necessitated unless you're a stickler for truly treating your car to the best of the best.But... if you're just a daily driver point-a to point-b kind of person, just buy two five gallon buckets from your hardware warehouse, and call it a day."
3,"Robert Cooper's writings chewed up and ""Dummy""-ized","Leave it to a Certified Management Consultant to put the best advice and writings of Robert Cooper (Winning at New Products, 1993; Portfolio Management for New Products, 1997) into For Dummies ""shrink-wrap"". The content is not new, there are no new ""silver bullet"" insights -- just repackaged content from the past decade of PDMA (Product Development Management Association) research and conferences, and Management Roundtable seminars.I bought my copy for $5.99 at the local discount bookshop. It was worth that just to have an amusing ""most all in one place"" reference with such amusing jacket promises as: ""Idiot-proof steps for making the most of market research""...Get the real references first."
1,Doesn't Work!,"Don't waste your money on this jellyfish sting protective lotion. After reading of the instruction, I and my wife carefully applied a good amount of the lotion to cover every inch of skin that can be exposed before getting into water. We checked each other and made sure to cover ever inch of exposed skin. Guess what? We still got stung by jellyfish, not once, not twice but a lot."
1,"Crude, rude & lewd & not for cat fans!",I kept thinking this was a joke but it wasn't. I don't want to meet one person from this book - they are all white trash! I'll re-read Lilian Jackson Braun a thousand times over. This is soft porn for a so called mystery. The cat did nothing except show up on the cover. I won't be taken in again by this author. I threw the book at the wall after 5 chapters & don't care who killed the movie director.
2,natural food is not always tastiest,"Item is naturally produced and dried. I got spoiled and preferred the bucket dried pineapple rings drippping in deadly sugary crap. This was the opposite of that. It probably is ""beeter"" for you but I returned it as it was dried and tastless compared to what I was used too. maybe natural is not fr everyone.IF your slightly diabetic this is for you.Amazon refuned full amount without delay, so I am eager to try differnt product as amazon wont stick it to you like some other stores do regarding returns; at amazon they have no quibbleno BS return . I am sure you have to act withina reasonable amount of time and they have always treated me more than fairly!"
5,One of the best British Comedies,"This is a hilarious and funny film set in World War II England, when a girls school is accidentally evacuated to a school for boys. The story is a classic, however it is the top players who make this film so very memorable. Alastair Sim and Joyce Grenfell are incredible.For those who love old movies, or are just plain fed up with a fare of slick, expensive, plot-less Hollywood movies, I guarantee you will love this."
4,The Pleasure of Their Company,"I rated this film with 4 stars due only to the fact that the original play it is based upon was & is a bit creaky to begin with. However for devotees of British cinema and comedy I need utter only three names: Margaret Rutherford, Alistair Sim and Joyce Grenfell- enough said already. These comic geniuses redeem, transform and illuminate an average vehicle of this most British comedy of errors centered around a public school. And yes, growing coffee in Tangynika sounds like a great opportunity."
5,Best book in ages,"I looked forward to reading each time I thought of this book. The author's descriptions just captured me and I'm not really sure why. I think some of his characters experiences were similar to mine since part of this book takes place in Madison but it was more than that. Wonderful writing, I really loved it!"
5,Crossing Safely,Read this along with End of Life Book Club and loved it! Lots to talk about in with my book club friends.
5,Human interest,Stegner is a wonderful developer of people and their personalities. You get to know each one and have your own opinions about each one as you read along. Wonderful book.
3,Being from Wisconsin,"This book takes on special meaning since I am from Wisconsin and recognize most of the places mentioned. However, the book drags on, especially toward the end. Maybe I would related more to the story line if I were at a different place in my life right now. I recomend the read, but leave your expectations at the foot of your statue of the Buddha."
2,Print too smal,"The story is wonderful but I had to buy another book. The one I purchasedwas a ""small"" book with very small print. I couldn't read it. I didn't realizeI was purchasing a 1/2 size book."
3,A Journey of Friendship that lasts a lifetime,I read this book because it was talked about a lot in the End of Your Life Book Club so we read it for our book club. They were aspects of the book that I really liked and at times I thought Stegner was way to wordy in describing moments in the book. An example would be when they were standing on the door step waiting to ring the door bell. But on the other hand it goes into the lives of both couples and how they were intertwined over a life time. There ware things we can learn from this book both good and bad.
3,Great idea....lost momentum,It started out great but the ending dragged on and on. Was expecting it to have more depth. Enjoyable but not a favorite.
4,Great Condition,"This book arrived and it was a pleasant surprise to find the book to be almost new. No page creases or soiled areas. Why buy a new book when you can get a ""like new"" book that is fine? Great seller too."
5,beautifully writte,"As a Madison alum it was really great to read a book based there. It is beautifully written, a classic"
4,Time and friendships,Young friendships are so full of possibility. Those that endure our lifetimes are so full of forgiveness and have been charged by the courage that love demands. I am glad that this novel has come to me at a stage in life that allows for reflection.
3,Crossing to Safety,"Wallace Stegner is a prolific writer. I don't know why I haven't heard of him before. His characters are very interesting. The story itself was a narrative more than a story. Yet, as the reader I did want to find out what happened in the end. As he said, nothing much happened out of the ordinary and that was its main draw. A description of the lives of regular people trying to live decent lives."
5,The meaning of life...,"A veteran of Stegner's novels, Crossing to Safety took me by suprise. His prose was as captivating as ever and his characters as beautifully developed, but reading this novel of life-long friendship profoundly affected me. I fell in love with the Morgans and the Langs and at times even found myself jealous that they had found each other. I desperately looked for parallels in my own life. At 27, I wondered who the Sid's, Charity's, Larry's and Sally's of my life would be. Surely this deep rooted, long lasting friendship is an essential ingredient in life. Or, as I now believe, maybe it is its purpose..."
4,"Nice follow up but I still love ""Angle of Repose""","Crossing to Safety is a nice follow up to Angle of Repose although lacking the depth and detail of Stegner's prize winning work. The prose is fairly tight with vivid images, interesting plot and detailed character portrayal. Substantial but again, just love 'Angle'!read it. you'll definitely walk away satisfied."
1,Disappointed,"The reviews for this book persuaded me to purchase it, however, I was disappointed. It was a rough read. The sentences seemed to run on and often I got lost. The ending was no ending at all."
2,I stopped on page 50,"I took a course on the art of reading at the Teaching Company. The professor, who was very good, told us that we should give novels that we don't immediately like a chance. If, after 50 pages we still don't like it, he says we can put it aside without feeling guilty about it.So I made it to page 50 before giving up.I gave it two stars because the quality of the writing is excellent. The characters are round. But the plot is lacking. Nothing happens. The people aren't terribly interesting. They have career and medical problems, just like everyone else.Read it if you're a writer interested in literary fiction. Otherwise, I would skip it."
2,CROSSING TO SAFETY,"Though the writting in and of itself was not bad, there was virtually no story of interest, no depth to the characters or their interaction, no educational value as to learning about new things, new places, or new ideas. This was the incredibly boring story of the very long relationship between two couples. At the end of the book, when finally some attempt is made to understand the dynamics of their relationship the book simply ends, leaving the reader frustrated and asking why they even bothered to finish it. It is a sad reminder that too many people live life on a very superficial plane and are content, as it is clear this author does."
1,"Lousy, manipulative, melodramatic","One-quarter of the way through, I had to keep forcing myself to finish reading this book. But read it I did, every insipid, insufferable page. The author tries so hard to make us love the narrator and the other three characters but I failed to see their charm. I found them unsympathetic and unbelievable. Ultimately this is an old professor's fantasy, with the oh-so productive yet self-effacing wise narrator, his virile friend who, despite his wife's resistance, only wants to write poetry, and of course their supportive wives. The friend's wife is revealed to be somewhat of a nag and control freak but we love her anyway. Sure enough, each wife becomes seriously ill. With little effort, you can see how this book could be adapted into a movie for the Hallmark television series. This schlock is dated."
1,Crossing to Safety,"I have talked to others and all either loved the book or could not even finish it. I could hardly finish it. The problem is nothing happens which makes the book too drawn out. I found the first 1/3 of the book was enjoyable enough, but after that I felt nothing was going to happen, and realizing this, I did not want to continue reading to discover I was correct. All the while, Stegner congratulates himself that a book can be written about nothing and people will enjoy it (one main character is also an author, maybe even Stegner). If you want to read about two couples, one with a very controlling wife, and their not too exciting lives then this book is for you. But do not read it for other reasons because the writing, the character development, even the description of the couples' relationship is average at best."
5,"I like the book, but...","Crossing to Safety is one of my favorite books from my college literature class and it has helped me to survive during the hardest times in my life. I would recommend this book to everyone, but I really hated this edition published by Modern Library Classics. There were a lot of misspellings and typos in this edition."
4,A great bookclub read,I enjoyed it. It was a sophisticated look at a seductive culture and the intricacies of relationships. What we choose and why we make the decisions we do. It was insightful.
4,Character driven novel,"This novel was very readable, and very intelligently written. Although there are few dramatic scenes, the story is carried quite well by the four main characters. Very enjoyable!"
5,beautiful writing,"This was my first time reading a Stegner novel, and from the first page I was immediately aware that this is great writing. The story was engaging to me. Some of that probably comes from going to college in New England and the novel providing a bit of a window into the New England academic world. The book's appeal is its wonderful writing, its interesting autobiographical parallels with the life of the author, a view of academic life before and after WWII, and is examinations of marriage and being a writer."
1,Ugly Violence and the Worst of Youngster Stereotypes,"Attactive animation and the use of the voices of regular kids does not justify targeting the youngest of audiences with junk like this. The parent bunnies appear briefly in this and set the correct example, but the rest is nightmare. Our toddler even cried which watching the second unexpected round of violence."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT UNLESS YOU LIKE TO WASTE MONEY,"If you already bought this, call Microsoft and get your money back before the 90 day warranty is up! This program is lacking very much vital information which was on previous versions. For example check out San Francisco. It will tell you when you check nearby places that within 10 miles of San Francisco there are 0-Post Offices, 0 - Taverns & Nightclubs, 1-cinema and the list goes on. Huge dissapointment - AND the customer service number to call for help with this program is not Toll Free. I spent about an hour on the phone and Microsoft is refunding my money for the program and the phone call. Microsoft reps have been great about resolving this, but I would rather have had a program with all the correct information."
2,Broken feature in Streets & Trips 2003,"I like the way the program works, but one of the most important features is broken with no update to fix it. You can not update the construction data with out manually searching MS's web site for the file then downloading it and copying it into the Streets and Trips directory. The message I got from MS support was that this was a problem in the software that was 'hard coded' (their words) and so when trying to update construction info you get a message that says 'can't find the update server' - evidently they moved the location of the update file and neglected to update the software. I would recommend holding off on purchasing this product until a) MS has an update, or b) the next version is released - hopefully without the broken feature."
2,buy Delorme,"I wish that the people at Delorme and MS would get together and create one good program. Delorme Street Atlas deluxe is a far better program than MS Steets and Trips, however; the printable map quality is horrible w/ Delorme's product.Delorme does better with routing (no vias in MS, only stops), GPS options and downloadable waypoints. MS does a better job w/ quality of printable maps and creating a web page.I use these programs to create motorcycle tours, give turn-by-turn directions to the participants along with maps, and look up GPS waypoints.If you don't need to print your maps or create web pages, go w/ Delorme."
2,microsoft streets 2003,"If you have an older version keep it. some street info on my 2000 version is more accurate then this version ""my home address"". I purchase it for the GPS feature, if it was not for that feature I would have returned it and continued to use the older vervion"
1,DON'T BUY IT!!!! MS really screwed it up compare to 2002,In whole Boston area it could find NO nightclubs or taverns (version 2002 could)! Even Museum of Fine Arts is missing!!!
1,Useless for Canada,"I've purchased the last 3 versions of this product and the Canadian street names have gone from inaccurate (2001) to accurate (2002) to inaccurate (2003) for Toronto. I uninstalled version 2003 and reinstalled 2002. If you're from Canada, save your money."
3,Hurts if this style thong is new to you.,"I love my Merrell Mandolin sandals, but was looking for a more contoured sole to increase stability. Unfortunately the Gardena thong cuts into the skin between the toes -- if I already had calluses there it might be bearable. I wear plastic flip-flops with no problem. Good quality construction and materials, in keeping with Merrell standards. Planning to return the Gardena and try the Sundew, which is shaped more like the Mandolin."
5,Love these!,I read all the reviews on the Merrell Gardena thongs and I am happy to report that I agree!They were comfortable from the first time I wore them and look forward to wearing them onmy vacation this summer!
5,The most comfortable sandal I've ever owned.,"I am purchasing these sandals as replacements for the very same item I wore out while on a tour of Europe. We walked on flat surfaces, stone surfaces, in the ruins, and up and down many, many stairs for 12 days straight and we were worn out at the end of each day. I took students on a student trip and we were kept busy from 6am to 10-12pm each day and probably walked at least 120 miles total. (Okay, maybe it just seemed like it.) I had these sandals several years before and they were wearing very well. They aren't dressy but they are cute with skirts for teaching (even the high school kids comment positively on them) and they conform to the foot well, which is great as my feet like to slide forward. I cannot rave enough about these. I usually wear a 6 to 6 1/2, but in these I wear a 6."
1,Disappointed in product,I purchased this sandal 4 years ago in a department store and loved it. Recently noticed that the sole was turning my foot black.Ordered this pair and experienced the same thing immediately!!!Very disappointed :(
3,Not made like they use to be.,"I have several pairs of these sandles, but needed a new pair in black. They are NOT made like they use to be, very narrow, don't seem to be the same quality."
4,"Comfortable, but not for a distance walker","I purchased this sandal and like it very much. My only issue is that the front bed is a little on the thin side and does not provide much support when you are walking 14-18 blocks each way from the train to work. After a couple of days, your feet may hurt a bit because of that. It is a great product though - the better one of all the sandals that are out there - so I do recommend them. They do look very nice with a suit."
5,A must have for any teacher!,"I bought this book as a requirement for a teaching writing course I once took, but I still refer to it on a regular basis! It has lots of great real world activities you can use in the classroom and provides examples of them. Everything is very well organized and broken down step by step. A must have for any teacher, especially writing or ESL instructors!"
2,Not up to par.,"Might as well be guaranteed to break just a few weeks after the warranty expires. A few of my friends have the same player, and all of theirs did the same. If you're looking to spend $80 on 90 days of music, this is the player for you. But if you're looking for permanence, don't stop here."
2,Good player for about 6 months,"I had this player for around 6 months; I was working in Wal-Mart's electronics department and I bought it off clearance. The player worked great for those six months; it was easy to use and transfer all types of music to. I didn't have any problems with the headphone jack either. The voice recorder even helped me during my journalism classes. Then after those six months, the player just died on me. It seems that the memory mysteriously erased itself, and I was unable to put any songs on it again. It froze my computer when I tried to plug it in there again too. To this day (its been almost a year now since it broke), the player still doesn't have memory."
1,Glitch City,"I bought this mp3 player before iPods gained fame. It worked well at first. It was easy to load songs on it. When you would turn it on though, it would have to register each song individually into the player -- it calls it ""indexing"".After a while this player has had so many Error messages and glitches that it doesn't work properly anymore. When I tried to get support online, there was no help from the company that makes the ILO. The people I talked to were rude and just unhelpful.Today, I can't get it to work right. I turn it on...it says it is updating the index, but never finishes until I decide to not waste anymore time with it and remove the battery.It was a waste of $80."
3,Cosmetically a disappointment,"When my oven was installed, I noticed that I could see metal parts and wires in between the control panel and the handle of the door. I requested the part and JennAire kept sending me the wrong part. After over one year, my husband and I made the part ourselves out of an aluminum plate painted black. I think the oven is a good one, but JennAire has horrible customer service and I will never buy a JennAire appliance or any appliance affiliated with them. I sent them a letter of complaint and have not received an apology or any retribution. I will continue to ban JennAire and affiliates."
1,Don't Buy Jenn-Air!,SO sorry I bought this oven. Jenn-Air discontinued our perfectly nice beautiful duel fuel slide in convection range. We needed simple parts to replace a poor install of the gas line and nothing is available and Jenn-Air had nothing to offer in terms of help of referrals. What a shame. This beautiful oven is now worthless and we must start all over. Strongly recommend you avoid this brand.
2,Historical curiosity from 1887,Be aware that this is a book from 1887.It has been poorly formatted for the Kindle--it has hard line breaks and the text doesn't reflow.
3,SPOILER!,"I read this book within 2 days, and was really enjoying it until the very end! The fact that Hero had a child with the Heroines STEP-MOTHER ruined the whole thing for me! Did this happen to anyone else? I just couldn't get over it."
5,Excellent,An excellent book - I could LITERALY not put it down. A wonderful story of the relationship between a woman and a lost child. I want to read more and there's no more pages!
5,Excellent,"One of the strongest American GMs alive writes books, too. This is his most recent and best ever. Not for the beginner, most of the games are GMs dueling it out. If you don't know how a knight moves, this book is not for you. However, if you have the time to play the games out, you will learn from Christiansen's clear advice to greatly increase play.He is clearly an attacking type, and shows the best attacking games he's seen. However, this book talks little about defense, so get another book for that.From this book, one will learn to sacrifice appropriately, wait for perfect moments, and destroy the king's cover. The amazing thing is that it's done within 160 pages. Intertwined with the actual chess is the story of how Larry increased in skill in chess.You can't go wrong spending a few bucks on this treasure. This raised my rating 300 points in two weeks! (990-1320) and I'm still going on strong. Thanks Larry."
4,Worthwhile book,"The book is loosely organised in 8 chapters, the last of which covers some of the most scintillating games of the nineties. There are good examples of attacking play throughout the book, many of them exemplifying the dynamic style prevailing today. Games of Kasparov, Anand, Ivanchuk, Shirov and Kramnik are well-represented here. The book should be enjoyed for these examples of sparkling play. While it doesn't pretend to be a treatise, there are nuggets of wisdom interspersed in the notes.A word of caution: some readers may already have seen many of the games in Informant or New In Chess magazine.Other books on attack that can strongly be recommended are 1) The Art of Attack in Chess, Vukovic 2) Attack with Mikhail Tal, Tal and Damsky and 3) Attacking Technique, CrouchOne can also recommend the books on sacrifice by Spielmann, Vukovic, Shamkovich and McDonald."
1,UNREMARKABLE,"Having read this book, I must say, I don't see why all the glowing reviews. Completely unremarkable. Gives Larry a chance to recycle his games, but beyond that, I don't see any reason to recommend this book."
5,Outstanding,"This is an incredible book. I found the games extremely enjoyable to play through and the sheer number of them (over 50) stocked my brain with all sorts of attacking patterns. The last section of the 11 best recent attacking games is worth the price alone.Crouch's attacking technique is really good too with its example of the ""three piece rule."" Typical Gambit quality and a solid treament of my favorite part of chess."
4,GOOD,Not a bad item. Bought it for a friend as a gift; she didn't like the ball movement; thought it was too tight; returned it; no hassles; seller very accommodating; very prompt on handling the return; didn't care for the 15% restocking fee; will read the fine print more closely the next time.
5,Amazing Photographs....,I saw an exhibit of this photographer's work at the Boston Mueseum recently. I especially like the way that his work makes you realize the scope and magesty of natural landforms and the beautiful patterns that echo throughout natural landscapes. The photographs are black and whites and frequently emphasize light and darkness.
1,Never received,"I was anxiously awaiting this book - it is very hard to find - but I never received it. The seller (not Amazon) accepted my purchase, then sent me a different book. When I asked for an exchange, the seller admitted that they did not have the book.So, it appears to be an excellent book, but I am still looking for it."
2,It cost a lot less than Adobe but that may be the best part of it,"It creates pdf files just fine but I am not sure why it is labled as ""professional"" version. It does not create pdfs with enterable fields. It will not edit an existing pdf. It seems to be an obsolete version that has a lot of catching up to do."
1,You get what you pay for,"Does not meet my needs at all. I combine separate pages/files into one document. The procedure is very cumbersome. You have to print each page/file into memory before they can be selected and combined. I am used to Adobe which lets you import from files very directly.Also, I need to add text boxes to the pages for reading and printing, but this will only let you post note icons which have to be opened to read.I would send it back for a refund, but I would spend half of the price on shipping."
1,Don't waste your money or time.,"This is a worthless program. It is clunky to operate and it's own ""help file"" will not open from the program button, and looks every bit to be a BETA version of a program that never really should have been sold retail! The help PDF file has it's problems... translated from German with many semantic quirks.Biggest gripe I have is that it does not edit existing PDF files, (which is the only function I wanted) and you cannot even select text to be copied to your clipboard!If you want a program to make PDF files, then just go to http://www.primopdf.com/ and download a much better program which is free.Amazon you have disappointed me by offering such a low quality item. I shoulda' know better."
2,Disappointing and misleading. . .,"For those readers who have grown up with and enjoyed the ""Little House"" books by Laura Ingalls Wilder (like myself and my children -- both male and female), these books may be a tempting purchase. After all, they purport to ""fill in the blanks"" after Laura and Almanzo were married and moved to Missouri.Let the buyer and reader beware. These books are works of fiction, only loosely based on the life of the Wilder family. The writing is average, at best, and the purpose of the books seems to be to an advertisment of the author's own series concerning a fictional pioneer widower clergyman and his children. Essentially, what the author has done, is to use a popular and well-known name, that of Laura Ingalls Wilder, and to take advantage of that name for his own future publishing profit.Not worth the time or effort.2.5 stars for average children's writing -- 0 stars for what seems to be the author's intent. Let's call it a generous two stars and leave it at that."
2,Don't be fooled,"Don't be fooled into thinking these books are even remotley based on the Laura Ingalls Wilder of the ""Little House"" books. She is presented as a minor character and this very fictionalized version of her life in Missouri. Pass this series by and get ""Rocky Ridge"" books by Roger Lea MacBride instead."
3,Half and half,"In my opinion a ""strange"" CD. I find five out of the ten tracks of this CD absolutely outstanding (2, 4, 7, 8, 9, five stars), but the other five range from disappointing (3, 5, two stars) to awful (1, 6, 10, no stars). If all the tracks were at the same level of the five which I love this would be one of the best CDs I have ever listened to."
5,Writing about Reading,This is fantastic... a must read for teachers of writing. Very informative with ideas that can be implemented immediately in the classroom!
2,Not so much shine,"I have nothing against Stoner and I like trying new products for our cars. I was hoping that this would, as advertised, give a nice, glossy shine to my dashboard and other plastic or vinyl inside the car. It really did not. I think it may have imparted a slight gloss,but not the type of shine you'd get with a liquid product and certainly not detail worthy. Luckily it was inexpensive."
5,Well worth reading,"If you go into this book with the right expectations, you will find it a real page turner, despite what some people say.It is not about software development, or about the technicalities of the NT design, but about the people, the tensions, and in short, the environment surrounding the development of WindowsNT. It is not just for the programmer, or just the average computer user, or even the person who has never used a computer at all. It should appeal to all of the above, but that said, you must understand that it cannot satisfy all the questions that people of any one of those groups might have.Knowing that, and expecting it, I think you will enjoy this book quite a lot."
4,You get a feel for how it's done.....,"This is a fast read in a very casual style. It doesn't cover any code, but gives you a feel for the characters that come together to accomplish large projects. For anyone who uses this stuff in their PC, it's a worthwhile read."
2,Tech Ed book,I had to purchase this book for my grad. class. I don't like it at all. It is almost a how-to book. Not an easy read.
2,"""required"" but out of date","This book was required for the Masters in Ed Tech in which I am enrolled. However, our first assignment was a ""technology timeline"" - this book only covered into the 1990s. Info was available elsewhere, but what a bad start! That's far too long a gap for this to make sense as a resource. In general, though it was probably terrific when first published, now the information is passe and obviously irrelevant to today's tech developments."
3,okay,"The textbooks came with packaged torn open at the side and many pages crushed, but as far as the book itself, had no writing or highlighter inside. I guess you get what you pay for."
4,Book Condition,"The book was listed as ""like New."" When I received it, it was water damaged. Nothing, harming the usability but past orders was in better condition. I was expecting it to arrive much sooner. It took more than two weeks to arrive. I was able to work without it but it was a disappointment."
4,Good,This was a well written text book where I learned a lot. The different learning methods and extra learning material on the web was a good idea. I never had the time to do those but it was good.
4,Good overview with specific examples,This book is helpful for a variety of people involved in education. It provided a good overview of technology and offered many scenarios and applications.
2,For true technology beginners,"This book is potentially useful only for true beginners in the world of technology and education and only in very general terms. In my case, it provided information that many language teachers would object to, and it was an unfortunate loss of a lot of money."
3,Textbook,The book was exactly as described; however shipping was not. I needed the textbook for class and paid for fast shipping and it was Late! I was disappointed when I contacted amazon and got no response.
2,How do you say it...,"Propaganda. BS. In a big way. Required for courses, too bad. Tech in the classroom has so far to go. How many F-22s could provide broadband in every school? Not many. But this book is not looking at that. Bland writing, rehashed, cheerleaderish. Get a clue."
2,An Unsuccessful Portrait of the Muse,"The Bride of the Wind, while scrupulously researched, fails to bring its subject to life. Alma Mahler must have been possessed of much charisma and fire to attract the geniuses that she did, but Keegan's dry account of Alma's self-absorption and reputed beauty left me wondering what she had missed, since the portrait does not accord with the events of the subject's life. (The movie of the same title, by the way, has the same flaw, though it at least paints an atmospheric picture of turn-of-the-century Viennese society, which the book also fails to do.) The book also bogs down with information about Austrian history and classical music that is far too inside-baseball to be interesting to a general reader."
5,You Are There!,"As with the previous reviewer, this too is my favorite Beethoven #3. Mr. Savall and company give this usher of the Romantic period , the work that made Beethoven BEETHOVEN!,a brisk(not rushed)and spirited reading. It will grip you and leave you breathless as it should. Romantic with a capital ""R"". The sound is a revelation!Top drawer detail, boundless dynamics, and a real sense of the acoustic space in which it was recorded. I wouldn't give up ny Telarc version with Dohnanyi and Cleveland but this one has them beat!"
2,Pretty Obvious Stuff,"Fairly interesting, but obvious stuff. Only a completely blind and ignorant person could not see that the ""Left"" has been lying, distorting and manipulating the media, courts and general public discourse for at least the last ten years. A group of amoral people guided only by power politics is bound to be treacherous and and dishonest. That's what feminism/homosexualism/liberalism are all about. What's new ?The question is: what are we, the vasty majority of citizens, going to do about the Lying Left ?"
1,"A silly, dishonest book.",As if the left could arrest someone for thinking their mind. Best to look at 'conservatives.' With A.G. Ashcroft cutting up the Bill of Rights it will be the Right Wing who will be the Real thougth police with Real power to arrest those who disagree with the Government
5,Great Book!!!,"This book shows how terriabley close our nation is coming to being tottaly controled by the government. Even our thoughts are under attack. This book exposes how this is being done, and provides numerous examples. This was all written by a former Liberal who use to support these kinds of actions. I recommend this book to everyone."
4,Understand the source,"If you really want to understand the source problem, read Leonard Peikoff's ""The Ominous Parallels"""
5,Left wing ideology is not liberalism,"From the introduction, I was hooked. ... I found her book refreshing in its candor about how the Left has lost sight of the founding principles of our country and no longer knows the true meaning of the word liberal. You are only a liberal if you agree with them; tolerance for disenting views is branded evil. It is clear that groups that once espoused equality for certain segments of our society (NAACP, NOW) are more interested in dividing not uniting society so that they can continue to perpetuate themselves-- much of it boils down to money and power (what else?). Political correctness is a Frankenstein's monster that is rampaging out of control.If you are willing to tolerate exposure of the intolerance of the Left (note once again this is not the same as liberalism) this thought provoking exposure of the Thought Police will open your eyes. Even if you don't agree with all of her viewpoints, this excellent book will make you think."
5,"Tammy Bruce hits a home run, but the liberals will miss it","Tammy Bruce has written an outstanding review of our society today. This kind of honest criticism is right on target, andit comes from an author one might expect to take the other sideof these issues. I agree with her on virtually every point, butthis has to be a book that the liberals will not criticize but will totally ignore. Well written and interesting; it is difficult to put down."
5,"I'm A Conservative, and I Agree with Her!","Well, I agree with 90% of what she believes in. Ms. Bruce has written an exceptional book. I encourage all Conservatives to read this book. She takes you on the inside of NOW, where the media won't show you. And she also takes you inside of a lot of subjects where Conservatives won't go, and shows how some liberals REALLY are. She's a very intelligent writer, and I hope for another book from her soon."
1,Irony At It's Highest,"I find it ironic that the conservative voices who have attacked ""poltical correctness"" taboos are now the same ones who will suffer no dissent on the discussion of the war. I agree with some of the basic premise of Ms. Bruce's book, that forced conformity of thought is detrimental to the proper functioning of a democracy (spare me the Republic vs. Democracy argument). The reason I gave the book one star is that the same people who hold freedom of expression so dear are now the same ones who label any dissent from the current administration as ""Anti-Americanism"", and I feel Ms. Bruce would be among that crowd."
2,A sophomoric read.,"Even though I find my self in agreement with most of the author's opinions, this book is not terribly interesting. Though Tammy does get in a few eloquently written pages, most of the book reads like one of the better composed messages on an internet chat room thread war.Any reasonable informed person won't find much that is new or insightful here. This is a collection of a few personal anecdotes, many pages that amount ot nothing more than expressions of personal angst with the left, and yesterday's headline news.I would rather read a well composed treatise by someone I vehemently disagree with than a pedestrian work by someone who shares my views. Skip this book unless you really have nothing left on your reading list."
3,Read Death of Right and Wrong first,"Her second book is much better than this one (The Death of Right and Wrong). Still though, a great read. 'Death' is much along the same lines and to me is much punchier, better written, focused edited and thought out.I look forward to her third book. I am disappointed she doesn't write more daily columns."
4,1st Amendment and the control of the national debate,"Ms. Bruce succinctly outlines how the left has used thought control and political orthodoxy to stifle the national debate on such topics as racism, gender equality, abortion and other issues.The most shocking revelation is the use of public funds to bribe the National Organization of Women during the Bill Clinton scandal and perjury era.Ms. Bruce's book should be a warning to progressives, liberals, and conservatives alike that the suppression of free speech through intimidation will lead to tyranny. The though police are in full swing now. The Republic is in danger of becoming a dictatorship. Moral values are set aside for political convenience and the 1st Amendment is in disarray!"
1,Misses the point,I really hope she doesn't expect anybody to believe that the Right doesn't do the same things she accuses the Left of. I also suppose that this would be a good place to point out that the media are only as liberal as the conservative corporations that own them.
1,horrible book,"Sorry, but she is closed minded, doesn't bother to look at all sides of an issue.....and drasw conclusions that to me should be kept to ones self."
1,wah! daddy didn't let me have the car tonight,"This Bruce's claptrap can be summarized by that.Learn to think, Tammy, the other Bruce, Lenny, died for your sins."
5,"One if by land, two if by sea","The British are coming!!(Okay, the liberals are coming.) And they want to control your thoughts not just your actions. The liberals want you to be so afraid of saying or doing the `wrong' thing you will be afraid to even think the `wrong' thing. And of course the liberal establishment is more than willing to let you know what is right and what is wrong.Tammy tells some amazing stories from her years as an activist for the liberal causes. I am sure some liberals feel that Tammy is a traitor, since she exposes many of the prominent liberals and their scary agendas.But she has not deserted the liberal cause, it has deserted her. They no longer want strong minded independent women or anyone else that thinks for themselves. They want someone they can control and that will help them control others.The book is very well written, easy to read, hard to put down. (in several ways.)I recommend it to people often and will be giving it as Christmas presents."
1,wah! daddy didn't let me have the car tonight,"Bruce's claptrap can be summarized by that.Learn to think, Tammy."
5,The left exposed,"Bravo. Concise and well written, this book will open many peoples eyes. If you liked this youll also like ""Showdown"" by Larry Elder. Ironically, because the leftists are really some of the worst bigots around, these books will do their eye opening partially because one was written by a women and the other by an african american.The way Tammy exposes the left reminds me of the way Christianity is exposed in ""Christianity Exposed"""
5,Absolutely Excellent and Thought Provoking,"It's no wonder that those on the far left attack Tammy Bruce - she's exposed their hypocrisy and their attempts to abduct each person's individuality in favor of group mentality spouting what the far left thinks they should spout. It's scary, frankly, how these people can manipulate not only the media, but individual's thoughts and actions, and how some people let them get away with it, following their advice like meek little sheeple. Bruce doesn't let them get away with it, as she pulls no punches, but is honesty and intelligence at their best. Anyone who cherishes and believes in the rights we as people *should* have, including the right to freedom of speech, and sees those rights slowly being eroded by the Thought Police, this book is a must read. It should also be on your list of gifts to give. The more people who read it, and who speak out, the less chance the Thought Police will have of abducting the rights of all of us. ~ Mary Ann"
5,The Truth Hurts,Tammy Bruce clarifies for many of us what we've known all along; the weak are like pack animals. Much of what she points out in her book made me angry. But the truth hurts. Beware of the New Though Police. They must be stopped - before it's too late.
5,"Bass Player Magazine, September 2006","""Bass Guitar: Total Scales Techniques and Applications - ""Total"" is the key word in this improved version of MJS Publications' best-selling bass book. Bass Guitar: Total Scales, Techniques & Applications ($25 list and street) includes new sections on slapping and popping, pickstyle, and fingerstyle. That's in addition to lessons covering every position on the fingerboard, in every key, and different ways to use them."""
3,Ok I guess,"This book does cover a lot of material, but I did not find it to be the mesiah of bass instruction books. A lot of the material is gone through rather quickly and it really seems to be an adaption from his quitar book. I definately would not recomend to a beginner."
2,There's no substitute for a music instructor,"I'm just beginning bass, but I'm already a musician so I've got a little insight into the process of learning a musical instrument. I play horns, so I have to learn guitar techniqe and reading bass clef to learn to play the bass. This book, by itself, really won't help you much, there's really no substitute for getting a professional music instructor and taking lessons. Now, in addition to lessons, this book is a somewhat useful reference, but here are some gripes: 1) it's a think paperback, the way it's bound, it won't stay open to a particular page on a music stand unless you pretty much destroy the back, then you have a bunch of loose pages. 2) The stress here is on basic techniques, not reading music. The techniques are useful, but the book isn't particularly good at helping a novice learn to read bass clef notation and play the notes on the bass guitar."
4,"Great pictures, but...","Joe Cornish is one of Britain's best landscape photographers and his talent has been recognized in many books. I have his 2002 publication, Light and the Art of Landscape Photography, and bought this one unseen because of that.The pictures certainly live up to my expectations, with richly coloured, razor-sharp explorations of the amazing Scottish coast, complete with dramatic skies that shows he worked hard to get it right.My only complaint it this book is not so much for serious photographers. Unlike Light and the Art of..., there are no detailed captions explaining how each picture was made. Sure, there are what Cornish calls ""field notes"" at the end, but they are far too brief and it's annoying to have to skip back and forth from picture to field note. Because of this, I would recommend Scotland's Coast for non-photographers only."
4,It's okay,"The stylus gets the job done...but for me, mini doesn't do it it. It's the length of my pinky finger and the cord is too short. I want a stylus that stays attached to the phone while I text so that I don't misplace it. The rubber tip works well and did not break apart like another Box Wave Stylus I bought."
1,not great,"Mostly a collection of bad neighbor stories. The solutions offered are pretty much common sense: ""Build a fence"" or ""bring some home made cookies"". There's a section on how to inflict revenge on you neighbor...that's pretty interesting."
2,need some more proof,"Listened to this cd, but didn't care for it too much. Their sound is rather odd, but I have to admit that the bass player ROCKS... both ON stage and OFF. Definitly keep an open mind when listening to this cd... and it would help to be just a little bit lit. 1 thumb up."
3,A Mother's Gift,"Title: A Mother's GiftSetting: Biscay, MississippiAuthor(s): Britney and Lynne SpearsCharacters: Holly Faye Lovell, Wanda Jo Lovell, and Lydia ""Ditz""Publisher: Delacorte PressCopyright: 2001Brief Syn: Holly Lovell has won a scholarship to Haverty School of Music because of her incredible singing talent. Even though this has been her number one goal, she still feels really down because she will be separated from her mom for the first time. Her mother has an unusual birthmark on the side of her face that often embarrasses Holly. At the school, her roommate is a rich girl that likes to be called Ditz. Also, when Ditz and Holly visit Wanda Jo for the holiday, Wanda reveals a deep secret to Holly."
4,This was a good book,"""A Mother's Gift"" was a really good book, a riveting read. I bought it over the net, hoping it would be a good book and I was right! Britney and her mum wrote a really awesome story, and I like Britney even more now, then I did before.It's better then the ""Heart to Heart"" one, which I also have. This one is a fiction story, mostly based on Britney's life, but the characters have different names.I won't give too much away, read it for yourself and you'll see it's a lovely book, well written and interesting!"
1,Quite the worst book I have ever read,"Judging by some of the fawning reviews this 'book' has received, Ms Spears and her mother are laughing all the way to the bank with this little number. Plotless, saccharine sweet, living the non-existant American dream, ""A Mother's Love"" is an insult to the intelligence, a comdemnation of the dumbed down, easily pleased society in which we live.This book will give me nightmares. Good thing I didn't pay for it, I'd be asking for my money back. Plus compensation.Avoid."
1,bad,"... what really bothered me about ""A Mother's Gift"" was, that it bordered (in my mind) on vulgar propaganda. It seems, that it was designed to rehash the cliched ""rags to riches"" story (the real Britney by the way only has the latter part of this story in common with her literary counterpart) in order to offer young girls and boys a vision, an image, a possibility (however remote) of achieving stardom. While this visage itself may be helpful for young people, it had an exaggerated, self-caricaturing effect. Most importantly, however, it was designed to create an imaginary solidarity between Britney and her fans. By implicitly suggesting, that anyone can become a star, it lowers the star's pedestal and puts her (in the minds of her fans) into the category of ""beloved"" (however fabricated and untrue this may be), rather than ""admirable"". If ""A Mother's Gift"" had been a pamphlet instead of a novel, at least I could have respected the authors for not calling their creation ""art"" ..."
4,What can I say...?,"I'm a Britney fan, not a big one but still a fan. And I admit that I brought the book because she was the author, not because of the plot or anything. It's very unusally for me to read anything that was not Stephen King or Christopher Pike. What did I expect? Nothing really that great. I gritted my teeth as I spent that 15 dollars. To tell you the truth - I didn't really want to. But I did want to see what kind of writing it was. I was surprised - the plot wasn't great. It wasn't that original, but I didn't expect a legend. But it was good writing. I like the way she writes, but I had to re-read some of the sentances to understand them. I read somehwhere that this book for orginally for 8-12 year olds. 12, yes, not 8. Anyways, I liked it. It's not going to be my all time favorite from now on, but I liked it."
4,Really Really Good!,"I am not a big Britney Spears fan, but I bought this book last year when it first came out and it was really good. I could hardly put it down. Its just a really good book that I would recommend for all ages!"
3,Seek more,I thought I'd try reading this just because it was available on the shelf of a teen reading section in our local library...boy was i wrong....I must admit the plot was well thought out with good characters and a good sense of direction to where the book was going~ it gave good lessons and suprised us w/ a few hidden meanings but it lacked one thing- development...the book is good~ for a fourth graDER but dont try it unless you enjoy narrow thinking and low reading level with no challenge
1,Poorly written.,"I grew up reading teen romance dimestore novels that, although low on substance, were written in charming prose, with engaging characters, kept me entertained and only set me back about $2. I ran across this hardback for $1, and decided to give it a read. What a waste of a buck. I've discovered numerous typos, creative sentence structure, and an annoying hick's-view-of-the-world perspective that was offensive to anyone who lives in rural areas.I feel sorry for those who spent $15 on this -- it wasn't worth the $1 I paid. Skip it."
1,Why not...?,"She has seemingly done everything else so why not write a novel? Well I'll tell you why not, because this story was badly written. The plot (granted, though quite different) has too many similarities to her actual life for my taste. It doesn't seem like it took an awful lot to write this. I hope, if there is another novel writen, that Britney can take time out of her busy schedule to write a real book."
4,A Great Book!,"This book is wonderful. It is not well written, but it is heartfelt.Holly, a fifteen year old with a talent for singing and Wanda, her sweet mother with an ugly, mysterious birthmark, are as close as close can be. They might be short on money, but have never been short on love.But when Holly gets into one of the best schools of the arts in the country, Haverty School, Wanda can't help but wonder whether Holly is going to want to spend time with her in the small town of Biscay anymore. And she might be right. Holly starts to act like she doesn't look up to and appreciate her mother anymore.At school, while making a new friend, Lydia, nicknamed ""Ditz"", she starts seeing the world in a new way. A bigger way. Sounds predictable, right? Wrong.The end gives Holly the courage to show Wanda what she means to her. This is a basic story, but with wonderful characters and a creative ending. This is worth reading for girls aged 8-12."
2,Um...no,"I didn't really think that I would enjoy this book but I went ahead and read it just to ""see"" if Britney had any writing talent. I do have to admit that Britney and her mom did a nice job with details and sentence structure but the plot was HORRIBLE! I know that it's a good idea write what you know and I'm sure Britney knows about or has experienced some of these kinds of things, but it was WAY too cutsie pie to be enjoyed or taken seriously. Maybe a 9-year-old can appreciate this story line but I think it will be hard for anyone else to take pleasure in reading this book. It was...OK, and I think I'm being nice. Good try, Brit, better luck next time."
4,"I DON""T like Britney Spears, but this book surprised me!","I am very surprised with this book that Britney and her mom wrote! I just want to tell everyone that whoever isn't reading this book because they don't like Britney Spears is making a big mistake! If you like to entertain and/or sing then this is the book for you. You may not like this book review, but this is just a recomendation for the book. I hope that you find this helpful to you once you take my advice and READ THE BOOK!! :) have a cool day!!! Bye"
4,Very good book for Mothers and Daughters to read together,"This Book is a great book for mothers and daughters to enjoy together. I think that Britney and Lynne Spears did an excellent job. I do have to admit that i do not like Britney Spears too much...but do not have anything at all against her. She is a great singer. To read this book I think you must start reading it with an open mind...and forget who wrote it. Because it IS really a good book and i think people under-estimate Britney. I love their style of writing, although i do think the book ended awkwardly and the ending was a little corny, it was very touching at the same time. I really do suggest it."
1,Omg Take It AWAY!,"First of all I am not a Britney fan, not even close. But even if she doesn't have talent in singing maybe she will in writing. Umm, no. This book was so...simple! I mean, ugh. Completely a sugarcoated book that a 5 year old could read. Nothing stimulating here. But hey, what was I expecting? This is Britney we're talking about."
2,Not the best brit product,"im sorry, but does sappy come to mind when reading this book? it comes to my mind, quite alot actually. This should have been a autobiography, except for the drama thing with Wanda's embarassing scar. Ok, so her mom has a burn mark, big deal. its apparently the world to Holly in this book. It does portray staying with your dreams even though you feel left out with everyone else around you. But i couldnt see Holly actually being a real person. not at all, and i dont think you will either. its like being thrown into a perfect made world, Brit, i mean Holly as the star."
1,not worth your time,"There are so many other books that you could be reading. The characters are flat and difficult to relate to, while the plot is unbelieveable at best. If you're looking for something with substance, try something else."
1,Not recommended.,"I think Britney should stick to singing. If you're a britney fan I'm sure you'll love it simply because it partly by her, but if not I wouldn't bother. This is simply not a very good book. It's too saccarine and sweet and not realistic at all."
3,In Limbo...,"This book can't decide if it is a coffee table picture book or something more serious and suffers as a consequence as it is not particularly good at either. I suppose it might be a nice, very non-technical introduction to the study of Mars for the very non-technical. If you are looking for a nice picture book (which I was) I think you'll find this falls a little short. I was hoping for something analagous to the NGS book, Orbit, and I did not get it."
4,Pretty Good!,"It takes a long time to brown the dog and, unfortunately, you can't leave it to rotate for an hour or more while you swim/watch television/do other cooking. While it makes delicious sausages and hotdogs of any sort, you do have to be careful if they're curved at all or they go flying! However, it's the perfect size for your average family. It's easy to clean, and most certainly, just as delicious as ball park franks with that wonderful ""snap"" to them. I got this for my parents and this is one device they'll use. It also makes fat free hot dogs a lot more delicious. However, the bun warmer tends to make bread more stale than anything else. Great purchase though!"
3,No replacement for a real rat,"This is an easy way to spare a living subject's life. Being able to ""isolate Sniffy"" and speed up time during a programed experiment is handy. However, if you've ever experienced working with a real rat, Sniffy may leave you disappointed. It feels like a computer generated set of shaping expectations -because that's what it is. I certainly would have never invested in this product if it hadn't been required for class."
2,Needed for school,"Needed this book for school, it was a very confusing book , not amazons fault but the publishers fault, and the professors fault for recommending this book for class , however the price was just right from amazon."
2,hmmm... no thanks,"So, whats wrong with working with real lab rats. No doubt sniffy is interesting but the book was very bland and even a pain at times. I will say that it has potential to one day be a great educational tool but for now they are still working out the kinks. Not to impressed."
1,Terrible,"If you are a college student and need the book titled ""Sniffy the Virtual Rat, Pro version 2.0 that comes with a CD; do not order it used because I have ordered the book twice from the amazon website and both books did not have the CD and because of this I can not do my homework which has caused me to be late to turn in my assignment!!!!"
5,Sniffy is the best,Este programa es lo mejor para ensenar a una rata y asi no estar molestanto a las ratas verdaderas. Es una herraminta fabulosa para ensenar.
1,NO CD,I was very dissapointed in this purchase. I only bought it for the CD and the CD did not even come with it at all
1,Disappointed,"While the little quotes are nice on each page, that is about the only thing this book has got going for it. It does not lie flat to allow for easy writing in it, and the cover feels like an old textbook. I was very disappointed."
2,coffee grinder by capresso,"I happen to have gotten a bum grinder, it does the job, but it sounds like it is going to fall apart. I have another capresso in another place and it works fine, other than the shell is cracked. I tried the cuisinart coffee mill and coffee grinders and did not have much luck with them, as to the consistency of the grind. The coffee mill did OK, but after a year it jammed because I did not know you have to clean the opening every so often, otherwise it plugs itself shut. I am still sold on the capresso, it is a nice grinder, but next time, I shall go to Bed Bath and Beyond, so that if there is anything wrong, I can return it exchange it instantly."
4,satisfied but...,"I bought this grinder off of a top review from cooks illustrated/america's test kitchen. The grinder DOES have a LARGE cup, I can grind enough coffee for a full pot in one go. However the cord for the grinder is about 2 feet long, and my outlet is near the floor. I reaches the coffee cart I have it on, but barely, making emptying the grinder a chore."
4,Lid hard to open w/ dry fingers,"Used for flax seed. Fast, but left partial seeds at the bottom. Had to use a fine-mesh strainer. The lid is too smooth for me to flip open with dry fingers."
2,Not a consistent grind,"The grinder at the office broke and we replaced with the Capresso Cool Grind Model 501. The big problem is that some of the coffee beans don't grind at all (or just get broken into ""quarters"") and grinding longer doesn't result in a finer grind. The result is a mix of grind size and no control over the level of fineness. (I consider this a basic failure of a grinder)On the plus side, it holds a -lot- of coffee beans. If you have a 15cup maker (or larger) this seems like it would handle the number of beans required. For our 10 cup maker, we fill it about half to 2/3 full. (Note - variance in the grind size is independent of filling the grinder or only partially filling the grinder)"
1,Broke after 8 months,"Mine worked fine but after 8 months it suddenly broke, the blades wouldn't turn when I pressed the button, I just heard a humming sound. Since I didn't keep the original receipt I had to throw it out. Will not buy this model again."
1,piece of junk: uneven grind AND broke < 1 month,"They definitely don't make coffee grinders like they used to!I bought this Capresso grinder as a replacement for a Melitta grinder that had given out after 25 years regular use (4 or 5 times per week). The new grinder was inexpensive (my Melitta had also been quite inexpensive). The Capresso's design was also very similar in to my old Meltita (at least that's what how it seemed). However, the texture of the ground coffee it produced was very disappointing: very uneven -- small granules plus lots of big chunks -- and additional grinding didn't fix the problem. I was grudgingly willing to put up with this situation rather than hassle with returning the grinder and selecting another...... Then, after less than 1 month of use, it died. While grinding one morning, I detected a burning motor smell (motor oil), saw fine wisps of smoke, and within a 1 or 2 seconds it konked out.What a piece of junk! Very very very disappointing."
4,Capresso 501 Coffee Grinder,I have only been using this grinder for less than a month. So far it seems to do a fine job at grinding coffee. 25 seconds grinds it just right for my liking. The capacity is slightly larger than the old grinder I replaced.
4,"Nice, inexpensive coffee/spice grinder","So far so good. I needed a coffee grinder in a hurry, but my local Bed Bath & Beyond was out of the model I wanted. In a pinch (and at a very reasonable $19.99 minus the usual BBB coupon), I purchased the Capresso 501 Cool Grind Coffee Grinder in black. I am using this for spice grinding, and I did notice that it took quite a bit of grinding - at least two runs at 30 seconds a piece - to get an even grind for each spice. But it works: stays cool, has a very large lid that balances on its own when inverted, and grinds whole allspice berries and dried orange peel to the required powder. I can't swear it's the greatest grinder of all time or that it will do the trick for those needing very fine coffee grinds, but it currently suits my needs and was inexpensive."
1,Capresso Coffee Grinder,It is less than 3 months old and wasn't used for two weeks over the holidays. The blades have quit working so you cannot grind coffee.
5,Great grinder,This grinder is perfect for 12 cup pots of coffee with no overflow. It's a little loud but grinds nice and fine for our coffeemaker. Very pleased.
4,Capresso,"I am new to the world of grinding my own beans but am very happy with this grinder and Amazon shipping. I also have a Capresso coffee maker and am very happy with that. My only concern is that a layer of ground beans gets kind of stuck in the bottom of the ginder cup. I need some kind of brush or something to get it all out. Perhaps this true with all grinders(?) Anyway, it is a nice push button grind and hold to the level of fine or course grind you need."
2,"great for spices, bad for coffee","If you need to grind up bay leaves or coriander or what have you, this little thing is perfect. However, for grinding coffee it comes way short. If you grind for the thirty seconds it wants you to, then the grinds it produces are way too dusty. Dusty grinds makes for a bitter, gross coffee. Grinding for only about 10 seconds makes some nicely sized grinds with a lot less dust, however there are still entire beans left in the finished product. I have to pick out some of the larger chunks and re-grind them. I'm not a coffee aficionado, but I can definitely tell that going by the instructions with this grinder produces practically undrinkable coffee.For a cheap grinder, it's certainly held up well over a year or so of occasional use. No problems on that front for me."
3,The good balances the bad,"Based on a review by Cook's Illustrated, I purchased this to replace a Krups coffee grinder that had given me many years of good service. I very much liked the size of the bin compared to the Krups. But I *think* the blades turn slower (fewer RPM) than the Krups. Also, it has seized up occasionally. I was worried the first time, but the blade was just stuck and once manually unstuck (AFTER unplugging - safety first!) it worked again. This was in less than a year of service. I get the feeling I won't get the same long life out of this as I did from my Krups, and I'll have to make a choice when the time comes to replace it."
2,Capresso 501 Cool Grind Coffee Grinder,"My wife is the coffee drinker in our house. She has purchased two of these. The first one lasted about two years and the motor froze. It was replaced and the motor froze in about 6 months time. She seemed happy with the grind, but I'll look for one that lasts longer. Unfortunately, she threw away the receipt for the latest purchase."
2,Disappointing performance from this highly recommended grinder,"I purchased this grinder about two weeks ago after our 22 year old Krups died. With Cook's Illustrated recommendation and the recommendation of the salesperson, I purchased this Capresso. It does grind a large amount of beans at a time but the grind is uneven even with stopping the grinder and shaking the beans around. Some beans are powdered and there are still unground beans in the filter when the coffee has been brewed. I never had this inconsistency with the Krups; I wish I could return this grinder as I'm very unhappy with it performance."
1,great grinder....,"I bought this grinder because my old Melita broke after 20 plus years. and this one seemed like a good deal similiar in looks to my old Melita,But it only lasted me 2 weekends then the blades froze up and it stopped working..it comes on but blades won't move and it just makes a humming sound..so now I have to buy a new one..think i'm going back to Melita"
5,Fast and easy to use,I bought this due to the Cooks Illustrated review. I was not disappointed. It works fast. In 20 seconds my coffee beans are ground. It is easy to wipe out to clean and it is big enough that I can fit a whole pot's worth of coffee.
4,a lovely book for very young children,Ideal Easter book for a toddler. The story is easy to follow and the artwork is beautiful. The shiney eggs are hidden and fun to find.
5,Wonderful book even beyond Easter,"My 2.5 yr old son received this as an Easter gift and just loved it. It is still his favorite book and 2 months has passed. He loves the shimmery colors, illustrations, flaps, words...everything. This is a great book! As a parent, I like the book as well. It is a classy book."
1,probrably put you to sleep,"I bought this book unfortunately not at amazon and paid full price. It uses chords to lead you through the key you are in and shows you the more popular chords, but does not explain why they are used so much or how they fit together, very vague. I am going to try and get my moneys worth and get through the agony of finding some good explaination in the book but so far he shows you chords but does not explain how they fit in progressions. Also poor choice of weird open chords to lead you through the key, I would never play half of some of these chors he uses. If your a begginer and want the essential chords other than 11 and 13 th chords, try Happy traums The guitarist's picture chords."
5,Extremely Worthwhile and Helpful Book,"This book is very helpful, and many chapters are exceptional, particularly Image Love and Relationships, Exceptional Mediocrity, Meaning and Joy, and Balancing Work and Life. The way each chapter is introduced, the use of specific human examples, the questions provided to enable the reader to explore the depth of his or her own problem, and the suggestions offered for conquering performance addiction are superb. The realistic tools provided at the end of the book to enable the reader to assess progress in conquering this addiction are most useful."
5,Hope and insight for many who are driven to perform,"Dr Ciaramicoli speaks with clarity and compassion and makes the 'syndrome' very understandable. Using the subjects in his practice as examples, I could easily identify with aspects of their driven nature. He makes a strong statement about why we feel compelled to maintain this compulsive lifestyle. Still, it was written not to sound like some dreaded character flaw but a general trend in our society that is creeping into the fabric of our cultural belief system. He offers us hope and insight into how we can better slow down and enjoy our lives and ourselves."
5,A Model Under Pressure,"I have been working as a model for 6 years. My life is extremely pressured, I am always trying to perfect my work, my body and my children seem to never accomplish the way I would. When I saw Dr. Ciaramicoli on Good Morning America, I could not believe the story told by one of his clients. She could be my sister. I got the book last night and read it through till 2am. This book is my savior, a guide to change relentless demands I place on myself and those close to me. I never realized why I have such difficulty parenting and loving. The Chapters on Image Love and Performance Addiction and Parenting make so much sense. I wish I had read this book earlier but hopefully it is not too late for me to change the course of my life. I know I drive people close to me crazy, now at least a have a map to help me to relate better and work with less intensity."
5,"This is not ""Muskrat Love""!!!",Don't let the fact that this CD features 1/2 of The Captain and Tennille. Toni Tennille can sing!! Great arrangements and a great voice.
1,Things AREN'T Swingin...,"I'm so very sorry to say, that things aren't swingin' here. Toni was trying to cash in on the 90's swing revival, but her attempts were ametuerish and unprofessional. And franky very emberessing, none of her standards sessions shoudl ever have been released, however her name is big enough that forty-something people will see her name, and see good sonsg ,and buy the cd, and they will accept it, even though she doesn't possess a swingin' bone in her body, these stiff and ""?dillatante-ish"" performances will make you realize, as I have, that she should stick to pop music where it really doesn't matter if you have actual skills and talents."
1,Terrible,"I've read many books but I've never felt compelled to write a review until now. I don't want anybody else to waste their money. The book is laughable(and not in a good way). Although the reviewing guideline says not to mention other reviews, I think it's worth noting that all four previous excellent reviews were by the same person. The book is presented as non-fiction, it's clear from early on that it's complete fiction. Which is fine if that's what the author is selling, but from reading the editorial review and the about the author section it's implied that the book is a true story. The author may have worked for the CIA(I have my doubts) but the book seems to have been written by a teenager. If you're looking for a good assassin novel(and make no mistake, Odin is a novel) try The Bourne Identity, The Day of the Jackal, or Hit Man. You can thank me later."
1,Not worth of risk,"I have tried this product on my 6 boxers per package instructions. 4 out of 6 dogs broke in hives next day. Any kind of a pollen allergy, dogs can have an allergic reaction to bee pollen. You do not know until you try and with this product risks outweigh the benefits (if any for dogs."
3,"Nice collection, but not anything you can't find elsewhere","The book contains a nice variety of works from early Christianity and to some extent the old testament era. If you are a beginer of the study of such works this is a nice starting book as you can see a small sampling of each of the many types of works that were written and the very different messages these books sometimes gave (part of why they aren't widely studied today in Churchs). However, every book contained in this work is to be found in other collections and I know of single collective books that contain most of these works and more with better translations. A nice starting point but not something that is really valuable to someone who has been already been studying other works from the time of the formation of the cannon."
2,Lost Books of the Bible,"Book had been well used, annotated throughout with plenty of highlighting. I'd rather do my own."
1,NOT for one who believes in the Bible,"If the Bible is to you just a collection of stories then doubtless you'll find this interesting. But if you do believe in God and in Christ then you will find these texts horribly offensive and blasphemous. In particulaur the Infancy Gospel, which portrays Jesus as a spoiled brat with supernatural powers. Contrary to the review below, NO Bible writer quoted from these books. If God inspired these texts, He would have assured their inclusion in the Bible. Don't read these myths and fables; study the prophetic Word of God!"
3,"Good information, bad layout","This is great source information to be able to reference some of the material available to the early church, just because it is not ""scripture"" does not mean it is not helpful.... try telling a group of pastors to get rid of their entire libraries because they are not ""scripture"".These are likely some of things Paul early church people would have read... ever wonder what kind of things would have been in the ""scrolls especially the parchments""? Paul requested be brought to Him... well it would not have been his letters..."
5,Ancient texts omitted from the canons,"I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in the bigger picture of biblical topics. Keep in mind that some of these writings are most likely pure fiction. I found that the book is in need of an update, taking into consideration new discoveries such as the Dead Sea Scrolls, as well as taking into consideration the need for inclusive language. The introductory paragraphs, and etc, are still worded exactly the same as in its first copyright of 1926."
3,Classic Collection of Ancient Books,"This is a classic collection of books that arose in Jewish and Christian worlds alongside or after the Bible. You won't find the same kind of quality, insight are sense that you do in the Bible. The differences are clear and no one would think these inspired. But they do provide a background to history and culture in the biblical world, and maybe a fact and truth or two. Nor were they ever ""suppressed"" like some claim. Good for students of ancient books and the Bible, however, newer translations are available. To see how some things from these ""forgotten"" books could be intergrated with the Bible, see the novelsEnoch Primordial: Chronicles of the Nephilim Book 2andNoah Primeval: Chronicles of the Nephilim Book 1."
4,For the discerning only,"While I have yet to purchase this volume, I have read some of it online. I have a problem in the forward where the author identifies ""The Sons of God"" of Genesis 6 (this applies to the Book of Enoch, which greatly expands on the enigmatical v 2-6 of that chapter) as the Godly line of Seth (Seth being Adam's third son after the murder of Abel by Cain), and the ""daughters of men"" being pagan cannanite women. Every ecclesiastical as well as scholastic authority states that the ""Sons of God"" were fallen angels (also known as the Watchers), and that is plainly evident in the Book of Enoch (which the author of the forward obviously didn't read or just missed that part). I've only read The Second Book of Adam (as well as Enoch and the aforementioned forward) as well as some reviews which say that some of the books should be ignored.My main purpose in writing this review is to correct the aforementioned error for the benefit of those who might purchase this book."
4,Quick & Dirty,"This book appears to be a shorter, more concise version of Stallings' ""Cryptography and Network Security: Principles and Practice."" It has a much shorter, and therefore less complete treatment of security concepts in general and specifically cryptography. It might be good for a focused introductory course on network-level security, but there's not much there about application-level security. Overall, I found it a little terse. I like Stallings' books on networks and computer architecture better."
4,Pretty good book for serious beginners,"Pretty good starting book for serious beginners in the network security area. Give you an in-depth overview of cryptography (part 1) and network security (part 2). The system security (part 3) is kind of weak. Most of the discussion are rather theoretic than practical, so you need another more practical book as companion. Anyway, understanding the contents of the book will lay a solid foundation for further exploring in the network security. BTW, if you hate math, this won't be a book for you!"
1,Stay away,"Comeplete and utter garbage. I am an officer in Ocean City and am constantly busy during the summertime. I just started using this holder in May and it not only ripped at the base, but also ripped off my belt entirely. Completely disappointed with this product"
5,Great holster,"It was too big for my flashlight, but it's a great holster. Would buy again if I had a bigger flashlight, haha."
1,Not Ok,I should have listened. I checked Streamlights web site and double checked the part number and thought I'd check it out. The other reviews are right. I have a Polystinger ds led and it does not even come close to fitting. Not only is the case too small but the length is way off as well. Try another!!!
1,Nice looking faucet filter but get ready for surprises!,"The first filter developed a leak after about 3 or 4 months. After a free replacement from the company (which took months), the second system decided to blink the red light after a week's use. We decided to just keep it and use the old calendar instead of relying on the electronics. Then, after about 3 months, my 6 yr old son accidentially pushed on it and it broke right off. For what you pay, a bit of abuse like that should not just break the whole thing off, making it impossible to repair. Why not use metal instead of flimsy plastic that develops inevitable leaks? I will not continue to buy any Brita products, however sleak they may look. Don't be deceived."
1,Horrible Waste of Money,I had one before and it worked fine. But had to leave it at my old apartment. Got another one and this one worked for only a day and then it was done for. It trickled. I mean trickled out and then stopped completely giving water. Not dependable at all.
1,Horrible Waste of Money,For those having difficulty understanding why I don't like this filter.1) It doesn't filter water2) When it does filter water it doesn't do it well enough- so you may not get that much clean water.3) The blinky light can break.4) It will cause your sink to get a leak.5) The leak will then seep into the filter.6) Your slow flow of water will then become a small line of water practically nothing.7) You will try to open it and find the top is hard to lose.8) It is unfixable unless you contact customer service.9) You will either end up wasting your money or you will buy another that will do the same thing.BUY THE PITCHER PLEASE AND SAVE TIME< ENERGY<AND MONEY
3,Filter leaks,"After using the Brita faucet-mounted filter for over a year, a leak suddenly developed under the ""collar"" part which is attached to the faucet. It had nothing to do with the washer, which we checked. The water started spurting out in all directions.When I called the Customer Service, however, they promised to ship me a replacement without asking too many questions. I suspect this problem is fairly common as I have read about it on other review sites (some people started having this problem after 3 months)."
1,Worked great for 3 months then started leaking badly,"Same experience here. I hoped this would work out for me, and it did- for three months. After the three months of perfect use, the crack above the Brita logo started leaking. the indicator light stopped working, and i could see the water streaming out above the area where you insert the filter replacement. We tried buying another filter, but that only worked for three days before the old problem returned. This makes me think the problem is a design flaw, especially since others have experienced the same problem. I guess you get what you pay for, and I'm planning to spring for a more heavy duty water filtration system instead of using one of these [inexpensive] screw-on ones."
1,Leaks all over,This is the SECOND Ultra faucet system I got after having leaks with the first one and this does the exact same thing. It sprays and leaks from all over and no amount of tightening or adjusting helps. I am going back to my good ol' pitcher.
2,The filter light stopped working after 1 month,I bought this filter for our kitchen sink. It was working perfectly and we were very happy with it- but then 1 month later the filter indicator light blinked red.{That is in indicator to change your filter.}We couldn't believe that- since it is supposed to last longer than 1 month.A few days later- the indicator light completely stopped working.I returned the item- and I am now looking into the PUR brand.I don't know if the problem was with the indicator light itself- or with the actual filter. When the indicator light completely went out we didn't know if it was filtering the water properly.I have heard good things about PUR- but I have no idea if their faucet filters would have the same problem or not.
2,Here's why faucet filters don't work...,It doesn't matter whether it is the Brita or the PUR. The problem is where they are installed: on the end of your faucet. Guess what happens about ten times a day? They get bumped. They get banged. They get whacked. They get loose. They start to leak. They break. That's it. Simple. They make perfectly good filtered water but they don't last because they mount in the worst place possible: right where you wash your dishes. You cannot help banging against them all the time. You can buy new ones over and over and they will break. I guarantee it. Get the countertop pitcher and be done with it.ekw
3,brita sink filter,"This product was great for maybe at the most 1 year. The water was excellent, no chlorine taste and ran faster through the filter then the Pur system I had before. Now I have to reorder it though, can't find a new one in any store. The part that connects to the faucet has been leaking when the sink is on and spraying all over the sink, surroundings and me. We had to disconnect it. Since there are so few on the market I am getting Brita again, Pur drove me nuts cause it worked so slowly. I also am probally going to get the one that comes w/ the sink connection and the pitcher since it is only $... more for the sink filter alone. Go figure."
4,Great product,"The price might seem a bit high, especially once you factor in replacement filters, but it is worth every penny. The water tastes great and filters last long enough to justify the expense.Installation is as simple as screwing it on to the end of your faucet and installing the filter.Other reviews have complained about the quality of the product. Personally I have experienced no problems. The plastic is very solid and it doesn't leak as long as you make sure it remains tightly attached to the faucet.One word of advice: If you're going to order this, pick up a couple filters ahead of time. I found the price of filters in retail stores to be quite a bit higher than the prices here."
3,"Brita is easier, but not necessarily better.","I had a PUR water filter for about 3 years and it worked fine. It came to a point, however, when changing the filter became too difficult. I purchased a BRITA water filter and was happy at the ease of replacing the cartridge. Plus the filter worked as well as the PUR filter (with the added bonus of a spray setting on the faucet.) When it came time to replace it again, I was dissapointed to see that the green indicator light was not working...(in fact no lights were working.) Now I am stuck with a filter that may not even be doing its job."
2,Boring...boring...boring,"I can hear lots better than this locally. Don't get the ""excitement"" about him at all. Sorry. Save your dough..."
2,soulful? More like soleful,"A cross between Elvis Costello and NRPS...whiney instrumentals, honking voice-overs...nice lyrics but painful to sit through"
2,Nice but still too many cliches....,"The man is overrated. He has written some fine songs through the years and there is evidence of growth on this record. Yet no one seems willing to admit that many of his songs suffer from really sappy and badly cliched lyrics that don't rise above the fluff of radio pop. I wish he'd take on a writing partner, to save him (and us) from the hackneyed gunk he all too easily spills out."
5,Escovedo's latest is his best.,"Alejandro Escovedo is one of the best kept secrets in rock. His sound is a combination of rock, country, folk and pretty much falls through the cracks as a particular genre. Man under the Influence is his best CD to date and that is saying something. This is a masterpiece, one of the best of the year. Escovedo's lyrics are dark and very autobiographical. His voice is distinctive as his songs, however it is the arrangements and production that make him so good. No one uses cello, violin, and pedal steel as intuitively as Escovedo. Your kids will not like this, this is rock and roll for adults. If you are looking for some musical adventure, look no further - Man Under the Influence is it."
3,Up and Down,"The theme of this book has been used before so it was not unique. Leather does not create enough negative energy in the drug lord the good guys are after, one almost feels sorry for him. Shepard the under cover agent in the prison is tough yet sensitive, mean yet gentle, smooth and rough at the same time which is counter productive to full impact of what is really going on. The prison inmates are too human and somewhat caring to get one's attention. The end was predictable, Leather needs to incorporate more twists and turns and make the bad guys really bad, not misunderstood. All in all readable but somewhat flat."
3,A decent prison / military action thriller,"Novel. I thought this book was a decent thriller, but some of the plot events were jarring because they were just so unbelievable, even for a novel. The pace of the book was steady for the most part, not particularly packed with action, with only a big plot jump in a couple of places.The ending really bugged me because the last action scene and the whole book wrapped up in about 3 pages. Way to quick and empty of details, compared to the pace in the rest of the book. The book would have been much better with another 30 pages devoted to a more satisfying ending (the 30 pages could have easily been chopped out here and there in the rest of the book, to pick up the pace a bit.)The writing and dialogues were decent, no question about the writer's skill there.It was certainly worth the money I paid for it (1.66), but at full price I would have been disappointed."
5,Classic Shepherd.,I read this book a number of years ago and fell in love with dan Shepherd straight away.(not in a gay way I may add)and was over the moon to see it in kindle format. An excellent read that reminded me of Dan Shepherds entrance to the undercover world.Cant get enough of this modern hero!!!!!!!Great writer and so easily read and so difficult to put down.Thanks Mr Leather for producing Mr Shepherd!!!!!!!!!
2,Hard Landing,"I was expecting more from this book, with me, I like to feel like I can relate in some ways to the character I am reading about. Sadly this did not happen, I also found there were holes in the storyline that I could drive a ""B"" Double semi through, being ex-military, I also found basic floors in the story in relations to military ways of life they were referring to, yes including the SAS.At the end of the book I found loose ends that were sort of just left dangling there, it seems like the author was wanting to just finish the book and get it onto the shelves.Thinking that it was the first book, I would give the second a chance, (to see where the character would go) the second is a tad better but the waffling (filling the pages with nothing speak) is still there. On a wet day with the TV broken, give Hard Landing a go. There IS something good in the books but it is not getting to me just yet."
3,Stephen Leather,"While this was a decent book, Leather's later novels were better. He is a darn good writer that has honed his craft.He is an English author who has not caught on in the U.S. but he will and I see movie contracts in his future.Norm"
1,HORRIBLE ! DO NOT BUY !,"I ordered this item as a gift for christmas. When I opened the package to look at it I found that the box was damaged and filthy looking. It was not sealed at all. I would of been able to look past the dirty, ripped package if it had not been for the tag that appears on the front of the base of the nutcracker. IT WAS PUT ON UPSIDE DOWN and there is no way to fix it without destroying the nutcracker. I am very displeased with my purchase and will be returning this monstrosity."
5,Glad I bought it,I followed the prep directions regarding soaking the filter before using it and I've had no problems with charcoal residue in the filtered water. There's a significant difference in taste between what I used to drink straight from the faucet and the filtered water. I recommended this product to my daughter and her family and to friends who questioned its necessity.
3,It works. Low capacity and questionable design decisions.,"Pros:- It makes my city water taste good, removing much of the chlorine taste.- Slim, attractive designCons:- Low capacity. I only get about 3 glasses per refill, and when you drink a lot of water, it gets really annoying. I just stopped using it, because it became too much of a hassle. If you are a heavy water drinker then this is NOT a good choice for you. Consider a larger capacity pitcher or a faucet filter.- The top part could have been designed better so that you can pour yourself a glass during the filtering process. As it is now, if you try to pour a glass while the water is still filtering, it will leak out the top and black granules will get in your glass."
