3,nice game to play with a friend,"This is quite a nice game to play with one or more friends...Its really humoristic and quite exciting to play if you and your friend are equally skilled. And its easy to learn: in about an hour you can learn the basics.But worms 1 was far better... I gave away my worms 2 cd to a friend, but no-one touches worms 1 !"
2,Rather spotty,"I am disappointed to find that the selections in this book are rather spotty. A number of major poems are left out, while some less good ones are included. Also, I dislike the concept of trying to duplicate the French meter in English. The translator has to twist and torture the author's text to the point that the English ""equivalent"" is often far removed from the original French. In my view it is best to avoid trying to convey rhyme and rhythm and sounds in English and stick to the the words, the concepts and connotations of the French text. I am very familiar with a number of the poems listed, but on first reading these English versions I just couldn't recognize the original at all."
4,Quick and entertaining,"This was a very fast but good read.Found that the author told some interesting stories on the lives of a myriad of boxers and they were quite startling and sad at times. The content of the book (lots of stories on a sizable number of fighters) meant that the chapters had to be breezy.The largest section was devoted to a favourite of mine, Sonny Liston.All in all, a good read, not meaty with information but worth your time."
3,Informative despite its flaws,"The shortcomings of this book are by now well known. A fair number of the author's citations sem to be fictional, and the attack on the Sibornes is unsupported. However, the actual campaign narrative in this book is really rather good. It takes a broad perspective, unlike many other accounts, is full of useful insights, and is well-written and entertaining. No doubt it contains flaws, though it is interesting to note that most of the critics of this book focus on inaccuracies in the citations (and the attack on the Sibornes) rather than specific errors in the campaign analysis itself.By all means ignore the rant against the Sibornes, and read the portions alleging various conspiracies against Napoleon with a healthy measure of skepticism, but don't dismiss the campaign history. It may not be the gospel truth in all particulars (what historical account is?), but it is more insightful and informative than most treatments of the Waterloo campaign."
1,"Bad History From a Bogus ""Historian""","For anyone to claim that the contents within Hamilton-Williams' book ""enlighten"" the reader is to demonstrate a very limited knowlege of Waterloo, or of Napoleonic source material. Many of the claimed sources simply do not exist, and of the ones that do, the author takes some from other historians' work. As a result, if one is to include this book in one's Napoleonic library, then it should be placed with other works of fiction. But insofar as a work of history, it is an execrable excercise resulting in nothing more than intellectual dishonesty."
1,Fraud & Fantasy,"It is amazing how many defenders this author has. Having been exposed for what it is, one would have hoped that everybody would steer clear of this book an other works of fiction by this ""author"".One wonders what motivates people to defend the indefensible and excuse the inexcusable. Maybe they went to the same ""school"" as the author."
1,Well written and entertaining?,"Yes, it is. But it is FICTION. Sharpe is just as good, and it isn't pretending to be something it is not."
1,Horrible,"I ordered a three-piece set of an earpiece, phone cover, and car charger for my Motorola i860 phone. When I get the order, the phone cover, custom supposedly, was too small for my phone. My earpiece worked temporarily, then it started shocking me, now it doesn't work. The only piece, the one I didn't need, that worked was the car charger. I'm very unsatisfied."
4,Good snack cookie,"These 1"" squares are low in fat and sugar, so parents can feel good about serving them to their kids. I wouldn't say they have a deep chocolately taste, but for a healthy snack they're pretty good."
3,Very Chocolaty,"I ordered these for my kids thinking they would be more like the Annie's Chocolate Bunnies snacks, but these little cookies have a very sweet and rich chocolatly flavor...more similar to an Oreo. In our house these would be for a special occasion dessert instead of a weekly snack. They also arrived with 2 bags popped open and only 1 month for use before the expiration date on all 12 packs. My husband and I ate most of these as a snack after the kids were asleep just to get rid of them. Won't be purchasing these again."
5,Tried & True,"What I so enjoyed about this book was the very hands on, forthcoming approach the author has in dealing with his subject. He very much encourages the reader in a way that gives you the feeling you are in his garden with him.No the book doesn't cover a million plants by any means...but those it does discuss provide intersting, precise & tried & true information.I refer to this book often for inspiration..& sometimes just the pleasure of gleaning insight from another gardeners life experience with all these plants & their quirks etc.Highly recommend this for any novice or veteran gardener in the Midwest!"
5,All titles!,"I'm a huge fan of Andreas Vollenweider, in fact I purchased ""Caverna Magica"" when it was first released on vinyl. I have several of his albums which I've recently purchased on cd. The sound of his harp is truly mesmerizing!"
5,This CD Takes You Places,While clasified as new age this CD will take you both backwords and forword in time and place.
1,BICYCLING Magazine Best Gear Pick (The Wrong Pick),Having read many reviews about different gloves the BICYCLING magazine gear of the year pick for 2006 was the Pearl Izumi Gel-Vent Pro Glove. Purchasing a pair I found that it was clear that the BICYCLING testers hadn't worn their gloves for very long. Within a month of regular short and long distance rides a hole developed between the thumb and index finger. After a summer of use more holes. A good pair of gloves (while in rotation with other gloves) should last a few seasons (with-standing light washes with the rest of your cycling gear.) This pair barely made it through one season of good weather riding. I would highly recommend looking at either a different model of gloves from Pearl Izumi or to a different brand altogether.Happy cycling!Pro-Great venting for hot ridesGood paddingCon-Terrible construction and materialsPoor value
2,the best comfort in the biz is not worth the low durablity.,"My pair wore holes after just 6 months of use. Pearl replaced them with their lifetime warranty but it still, its not worth the hassle."
4,Really nice watch!!,"I ordered a second one of these about 2 yrs after I got the first because the price is so great and I really like the watch. It's very attractive and as I've experienced with Seiko watches over many years, they're pretty sturdy and hold up well!!"
4,My Favorite PSX Game,"Although this game is my favorite for the PSX, I still gave it four stars. The gameplay is excellent. You can do anything and everything with this. You can have little clips and have people shooting and blowing eachother up with grenades (thats what I did). Make your own weapons, magic, monsters, and all that great stuff. The reason why I gave this game 4 stars is because one has to type with the controller. It should of came with an optional keyboard. If it had a keyboard, this game would of conquered all oppositions."
3,"Fun concept, but so, soooo time-consuming...","I'll admit, the thought of making your own rpg is very appealing, but there are just too many downsides to this game! The most annoying is the fact that you have to type in text with your controller... is this some form of medieval torture? The graphics are definitely NOT what I'd expect for a psx game... another letdown. And let's not forget about how incredibly long it takes to complete even the most mediocre of rpg's! If you're like me, you'll be fighting the urge to heave your psx out the window... so what I'm trying to say is, rather than spending around ... on this game, try renting it first, or even better, download a little program called graal ... and build your own rpg for free, with much better graphics to boot! (I swear they're not paying me)"
2,Patience,"You'll need a lot if your going to make a serious adventure. You have a simpler concept to use, since it is mapped out for you in text windows. The game itself is simple too annoying to play. After seven hours, I completed one half-finished village. Imagine how long for the whole game. Plus you need to use the playstation controller to write out anything that your characters will say. Scripted events are near impossible to make, bug testing is not fun, and you will start to go insane at the point of 20 hours.Whenever you hear someone say ""I Could Make A Better Game Than That!"" shove this game in their face. It ought to put him (or her) in their place. Only recommended for the extremely super patient."
3,This is not a game!,"This is for people who are interested in creating their own RPG and sharing it with others, or people who want to just play games that others create. As far as game wise it is a poor investment if you don't have the time. I just wish that thier was a more visual guide one could buy to help out with the creation process."
2,This is the most boring time consuming game ever,"When I first saw this game and read the reviews I admit I was psyched. Finally what I had always wanted a game to be make my own role playing game wow it was all most too good to be true! But to my disbelief it was too good to be true. Some aspects of the game were simple and fun but as I went on It became confusing difficult and down right frustrating. I give it two stars for the pioneering effort in hopes that they will make a different version someday. But until than you won't find me wasting my time on this lame fall on it's face of an attempt to make a true ""RPG Maker"" and I don't advise you to ether. Mabye you'll like it but don't say you wern't warned if you don't!"
1,NO!!!!,"This game Sucks!! Sure it looks really sweet.But:I spent about 70 hrs on this and it took my 17 year old brother(a total complete technophobe who never plays vidio games ,espsially RPGs) 1/2 an hour to beat the fric'n thing. Total waste. Do not by this!!"
1,Don't even bother,Don't even bother buying it I thought it'd rule when i started playing it I was like this is so (...) it is way to long to make your one Character and (...) DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY IT IS A DISGRACE FOR ALL PLAYSTATION GAMES AND HAS LAME GRAPHICS!!!!!! BUY SOMETHING BETTER LIKE A PLAYSTATION 2!!!!
1,Don't Buy this game.,"If you want to make an RPG, don't use your playstation, because it'll take you years to type out all those scripts with a controller. It's a pain to use, as well as extremely limiting, and ungratifying. Your games can only be played by others who have the game, and it involve memory cards which can easily be accidentally erased. This product is just all around bad. ..."
1,Crap!,its a stupid game when i played it i couldent even get a Dungen completed (i no its sad) u sould save ur money
5,One of the greatest,"RPG Maker is one of my favorite games for PS1.LET ME JUST SAY IF YOU HAVE NO PATIENCE DON'T BUY THIS GAME! If you have the time this game will be one of your most used games ever! You should at leat give it a try. I did and I personally love it. I'm even working on my own game it's called Dragon Masters.I've put more than 30 hours into mine and I've got a pretty short game. The graphics are okay. Well, at lest for me, they are 2-d mediocres fom SNES. The music is good but it needs more. It took me weeks to figure most of the stuff about RPG Maker. I can say the hardest thing about this game is event creation. Be prepared to put hours figuring it out. Don't worry it's all worth it."
3,RPG Maker's shortcomings,"It is the only of its kind that I know of,but this game is woefully generic+lacks good graphics.That aside,it is also very simple,and learning to use it took me minutes.A must for anyone who wishes to avoid certain games... and wants a game with something newer games lack:gameplay."
4,"Good, But Tiring","This is a great game, which is used to make your own two-dimmensional RPGs, but it lacks easy compatibility to trade games with friends and it lacks the ability to import your own graphics or even music. It is still custamizable, but, for example, there are only 68 songs you can chose from. Also get ready to be tired of typing a lot on one of those screens with a cursor moving to from letter to letter. It requires a small amount of knowledge and understanding of variables to do anything right. Taking upto more than than 15 blocks (if you have a larger memory card, which you must if you want to make an anywhere long enough RPG) it does not deserve a very good scrore except for that I liked the battle system and the effort. Next time though it should be more customizable."
2,Not my favorite journal...,"Although I really like the cover and the generous number of pages, I was very disappointed in the lined pages. The lines are so light that I can not even see them as I am writing on a page. It's very frustrating and makes my pages look very sloppy.I do feel that the maker of this journal shouldn't even bother with lines if this is what they are going to provide to their customers. I know that I won't buy another journal from them."
2,not williams' best,"having been a big fan for a long time (and still is), this was a bit of a disappointment. Robin has always relied on his quick wit and his ability to act on impromptu (or at least the perception of it). this piece felt toned down, and his material not quite as original. For example, the scene where he had to use slow-motion effects to get the joke across. this review is based on comparison with his previous 2 releases: live on broadway, robin at the met. He's still one of the best in the industry, and i'll be adding this to my collection."
2,Disappointingly not very funny,"I love Robin Williams' previous works, but this one was more vulgar and not nearly as funny. I was disappointed."
2,Well what can I say,"Of course Robin is funny at times during this performance but it's hard to enjoy his show when he's so clueless about what's really going on in the world. He obviously sits in front of the television watching CNN all day for his political perspective and jokes. It's hard to respect someone who doesn't seem to read even one of the HUGE number of books out there now informing people of what's really happening in the world and especially with our government. Instead he listens to the prepackaged homogenized news that TELLS you what to think (CNN, MSNBC, FOX, ABC, NBC, CBS). I always thought Robin was more intelligent than that. I've completely lost respect for him. He's no Bill Hicks. A suggested reading list for Robin would be:Confessions of an Economic Hit manUnequal ProtectionEmpire of IllusionCracking the Code"
1,poor delivery,I have gone through circles at my mail room and we have come to the conclusion that the dvd had never made it to my address. I was not satisfied how this order was taken care of.
4,Its not bad!,"Alright.. so I bought this and have listened to it a few times.. It's not bad at all, but I don't think it's golden.. worth the $11? Yeah.. i think so.. plus I do like Robin Williams! :)"
2,Robin Could do better,I love Robin Williams but this show started off funny but after awhile I lost interest. Seems as though he as tired. DVD was in good condition.
2,Not a favorite,Didn't are for this one very much. Live on Broadway was much better. Kind of flat. We watched it the one time and haven't watched it again.
5,So funny!,"Robin Williams is hilarious!! I laughed so hard that I started to cry!! You can't go wrong with this DVD, just make sure that there aren't any kids ANYWHERE around because it is not at all PG"
4,Robin... better than ever!,"I found this to be one of his best DVDs, but you should be aware that it is DEFINITELY R RATED! If that doesn't bother you, then I would definitely recommend it."
2,Robin's Routine Hasn't Grown Up With Us,"A bunch of stuff about sexual acts that most people will never practice, and which most people who have, now regret. And, a bunch of predictable, easy jokes that are based on myths (i.e. the lie that child abuse is more common among Catholic clergy than other religious people, or in secular schools.)Just boring, dirty talk based on easy lies.Dennis Miller sounds better and better all the time."
5,Hilarious!,"Robin Williams is brilliant in a great variety of performances, but this was a hilarious reminder of his ability to do standup comedy that never even allows you to catch your breath from laughing so hard."
5,I loved it,Robin williams is still the king of comedy my mouth hurt after from luagphing that much it was smart and funny
4,Interesting & Funny,"I just finished watching this yesterday. It was a pretty good show. There wasn't as many laugh out loud moments as I would've expected. So that's why it doesn't get a 5 from me. It took a while to really get going in my opinion, but overall it was very funny. He does get more political than I'm used to him being. So that surprised me. But, overall a good DVD to watch. I love Robin Williams!"
3,Kinda Boring,"This one is kinda boring. The first half is pretty good. It is about current and political events that I understand what he is talking about. The second half is just boring. You can see that the audiences are pretty much quiet. The second half is more about some specific people. This is a hard sale because I don't know the people he is talking about. So, I don't know why it is funny. There are also many recycled contents like the French, the Jamaican, and the water bottles.The DVD itself comes with many old clips. I really like the golf clip from Live On Broadway."
1,IT DOES NOT LIKE VISTA,"I spent several hours trying to get this game to run with Vista. To begin with the Starforce brand of protection drivers had to be updated from their website, then the game patched to run with Vista downloads from the CDV site, and trying to communicate with CDV, forget about that, anyway I never did get the game to work but at least BLS Mart, here on Amazon, gave me a refund."
3,Panzers Phase two review,it was fun but i have so much trouble playing it theres something wrong with the game. i tried playing it in both of my laptops and it wont let me. it says theres no cd and sometimes that theres errors. i have only been able to play it like trhe times
2,It should have been a patch.,"This game should have been a free patch to codename panzers one.I don't now how stormregion had the nerve to charge 40 bucks and tax for this game.I really enjoyed codename panzers one and was looking forward to the release of this game.Its little more then an improvement on the gaming console and a slight extension of the game.I really do feel robbed,I'm sorry."
5,Unique Blend of Classical and Jazz...Toe Tappin' Fun!,"I am a huge fan of this music! Bolling and Rampal serve up music that is beautiful and moving (literally). I guarantee one listen and you'll be hooked! I have purchased everything I can find by these two very talented music men-Gershwin-like and yet unique in their own right.This disc is a feast for any fan of music...seriously this is superb! Buy it, savor it, cherish it. It is 48 minutes of musical bliss!"
3,Just a popular history,"This popular history of SS colonel Jochen Peiper's exploits turns out to be short on substance, as well as substantiation. Still, it reads quickly and does flesh in some of the action surrounding the old storm trooper. Not a very satisfying read for die hard history buffs (most of it is already well known) and the editing is an atrocity, but for youngsters and others unfamiliar with Peiper and his role in the Battle of the Bulge, this book will probably serve to stir some interest in the events of those days."
1,Wonderful....at first...then....,I was thrilled with my new vacuum at first. It worked GREAT and had strong suction. My carpets looked new. AFter about 5 or 6 uses I noticed a decline in suction and after about 3 months this vacuum is useless!!! It suctions up the dirt then in a flash spits it back out!!! WHAT A MESS!!! I am dumping this heavy piece of junk to the curb as soon as I finish my letter here and getting a DYSON!!!
2,Works well at first . . . .,"The vacuum works well at first on carpet. The suction seemed great. However, it clogs extremely fast, and now (after having it for 4 months), I'm going to garage sell it.I should have learned my lesson. We bought a slightly cheaper Eureka and gave it away because the suction got worse and worse.Very disappointed. Should I go back to bags?"
1,Useless!!!,I don't usually do these reviews but this is such a terrible product! It is so poorly designed that you will spend more time trying to unclog it than you will vacuuming. Quite honestly it's completely useless.
1,Three weeks 36 houses 9 hours a day the roller brush motor stop working,"I purchase your Eureka Boss 4D Upright Vacuum - 5892BVZ and used it for three week until the roller brush motor stopped working. I just want you to know that this is a very good vacuum. For the three weeks I had it, I was able to vacuum in 36 homes for a total of 324 hours. See I clean homes. And the owners have pets. This vacuum would clean pet hair off and out of carpets very well. The carpet would look EXCELLENT. I always maintain my vacuums which have been Eurekas."
1,Worst. Vacuum. Ever.,"I know I'm beating a dead horse here, and others have said everything I am about to say about this monstrosity of a vacuum. It's the every-other-day frustration of using this machine that compells me to keep writing what others have already written. I hate this vacuum with every ounce of my being. The attachements are cumbersome and the hose is too short. The dust wand attachment is a gimmick. This vacuum had good power at first, but that declined very quickly. I suspect many of the 5-star reviews on here were written right after the vacuum was purchased. It doesn't pull well at all, and what it does pick up seems to come back out as soon as the unit is turned off. I've dutifully changed the filters, checked for clogs, and emptied the dust cup, but nothing helps, and the cursing continues. Don't buy this vacuum. It's a piece of junk."
1,Awful vacuum!,"The first time I used it I thought it was great. The second time, it smelled like it was overheating and so we needed to unclog it and clean it out. Wish I would have returned it then! I've had it a year and a half now and after each room I need to empty it out. Most often the dust and hair goes into the filter on top, not the container below. It is constantly overheating and makes awful noises!"
3,Great on carpets terrible on floors,We loved this for thick pile carpet--nothing better. But on wood floors it spits more dust around the room than it picks up.
1,How do you hate a vacuum?,"I know now! Believe me, I'd give it ""zero"" stars if possible. This is the cheapest piece of garbage I've ever owned! I had to duct tape the filter on because even the normal back and forth motion would make it pop off. After each room I have to take the hoses apart and un-jam it, if they haven't popped off before that. It spits out balls of carpet fiber instead of sucking it up.Honestly there isn't one positive thing I can say about this hunk of junk! Don't buy it!"
1,A huge waste of money,"I bought this vacuum when my Windtunnel kept malfunctioning. I thought I would buy a nice cheap vacuum this time after investing in the more expensive Windtunnel. This vacuum is NOT for pet owners. The canister is small and fills up almost instantly. You need to empty it after every room and it is messy to empty. The filter clogs constantly. The attachments are clumsy and hard to use. My preteen son used it in his room and didn't realize the canister was full because it is hard to see in. When we emptied the canister it spilled everywhere. The vacuum is useless on hardwoods, and even on carpets it spits back hairballs.Don't waste your money on this."
2,"Heavy, difficult to use and poorly attached handle...","I bought this vacuum based on the many positive reviews I had read, and the suction was good. However, it was so cumbersome to use that the great suction didn't really matter to me. Because so many parts (like the handle, the dust attachment) are attached after you get the vacuum, they are constantly falling off, which makes it very difficult to use. Added to that, because the vacuum is heavy and there is so much suction it's difficult to use around tables and the edges of the room. And the attachments are basically useless.So if you want a vacuum that will do a fabulous job for the center of your room, or for a room that doesn't have any furniture in it, this is the perfect vacuum. If not, then it isn't."
1,DON'T BUY THIS VACUUM,"This is a terrible design for a vacuum, unless you do not generate any kind of dust, etc. It the bagless cup holds nothing and you are constantly emptying it. I tried to contact Eureka regarding the design of this vacuum and they never even responded."
1,Returned after 2 months,"I bought this vacuum about two months ago and thought it was the best thing ever at first. It had incredible suction. However, after about a month, it went from sucking up everything in sight to leaving a lot of debris around our home. One time it wouldn't even start. I spent a few hours cleaning out the filters and making sure the vacuum wasn't clogged a few different times. Plus, the vacuum was very heavy (but that wasn't why I returned it). So I finally just returned it last night and bought a Hoover WindTunnel (which so far is great but I loved this one at first too)."
4,just bought this vacum today,"i think i found a new friend. my other vacum lasted me 5 years. but i think it gave out about a year ago. lol. i just vacumed with my old one yesterday. and revacumed with this new one today. the WHOLE canister was FULL!!!! gezzzzzzzz. it IS a heavy machine. but i dont care. its got a heppa filter, which my dermatologist recommended to me, its got that cool duster thing, that i didnt even think i would use, and it SUCKSSSS major dirt and dust, and i LOVE the yellow. for those who are complaining about not doing well on barefloors....ummmmmm, its called a BROOM. if you can handle a heavier vacum, than this is the one i recommend. ESSPECIALLY for the $$$! i paid about $200 for my old one, and i dont ever remember it working this good. and it was barely $70...."
1,I couldn't believe it...,"My wife actually was the lucky one, as she got to use the Eureka 4D Boss, and all its little gadgets, before I could actually get my hands on it. We picked this vaccuum up at WalMart one night, took it out of the box the next. She vaccuumed the downstairs with it, had some issues with the way it handled. After she went to work, I vaccuumed my office with it, only to find out that the roller brushes didn't work. I tried and tried and tried to get them working, even succumbing to dismantling the cleaner to see if the belt slipped off. After being unsuccessful with the repair job (I could never get the thing apart) I immediately took it back to WalMart.I knew better than to buy a Eureka. I knew better but got one anyways. Thank god for sales receipts and return policies."
1,"Bought on ""sale""","Will not buy Eureka againMy 5892BVZ stopped working and I checked the wire connections on the on/off switch and the black and purple wire connection was burnt at the connection point and the wire melted about 2 inches down.This thing requires a lot of maintenance to keep in good condition, and even doing that It still fried the wiring."
1,Don't Buy!,"This vacum is the worst purchase I ever made. It doesn't pick up very well and what it does pick up it spits back out once I have turned it off. It is very heavy, I can not sweep my stairs with it. Do not buy!"
1,Total Junk,"Like a couple of other reviewers, I picked up this machine at Walmart earlier this year (Feb 2010). It worked great for the handful of times I got to use it. I don't need to vacuum very often so haven't used it much. Yeah, it died on me today. The motor runs in bare floor mode but not carpet and it's not sucking up anything even on bare floor mode. I'm out $150 and Eureka will never have my business again."
1,"The worst ever vacuum, clogs everytime",This is the absolute worst vacuum I ever owned. It clogs every time it's used and is a dirty mess to unclog. The attachment brush no longer spins. I've changed the filters twice but it's still horrible.
2,Worked for about a year...,"This vacuum worked fine for about a year and then suddenly became pretty useless. I have a two bedroom apartment, so it's not like I have a huge space to constantly clean. My biggest problem is that it seems to shoot the dirt right back at my feet, which not only means I'm wasting my time using it, but it also hurts! Filters are clean, so there is no reason why this thing doesn't suck, except in the figurative way."
4,Disney Studio Trivia - Rocks!,"This is a great game. I am a Disney buff, and on the medium level I only answered 60% of the questions correctly. I can not wait to move through to the hard round. I do wish that they had more token pieces to chose from. The graphics are incredible and so is the sound. EXCEPTIONAL buy!"
4,Fun but tough at times.,"In this game, you go around the Disney studio answering questions in five categories. Once you've answered a question in all five, you then go for a game winning question. Sort of like Trivial Pursuit, Disney style. You need to have the disc in the PC when you play the game."
4,Comprehensive Reference Source,"I used this book to research the two Batman movie serials made in the 1940's. I found it to be loaded with valuable information about not only the serials, but ALL of the Batman live action movies released between 1943 and 1997. I highly recommend this book to serious Batman fans."
3,Quite an informative look,"Found this at my local library and it was hard to pass up. While it's not very well written and is, as others have stated, very repetitive, I did find it very informative with a lot of great information. I wouldn't say no to an updated edition with grammar corrections, less detailed synopsis of every project and new Batman projects after 2005."
3,Great USFL cover - quiz - name that player ATTEMPTING to make the catch...,"Wrong, it's Ken Dudek, reserve TE forthe Baltimore Stars, formerly the Phillystars on the cover. Fine USFL clips in-side this VHS tape. Get it while you can!"
5,B-17 Flying Fortress,"I had a good experience with this purchase , It came in a timely manner and the quality was good .Thanks again Bill"
1,Wish I would have known,"My daughter opened the camera and it was a hit!! Then we tried it, still looked pretty good. She took it to school and had a great time. The bad thing is that we tried this 3 times. I took the camera to her soccer game thinking that maybe it was something she was doing. No such luck! The camera will not store pictures for very long, not even long enough to drive home. The software is terrible, no Bratz content what-so-ever. So much for the scrap booking idea! Don't buy it, and if you ever find a good kids 1st camera please rate it so I can get one. Very disappointing."
5,Marcus Roberts Trio: Celebrating Christms,"Marcus Roberts is an amazingly talented pianist - either in Jazz or Classical music. I'm so pleased that he has made such brilliant career moves. (He is a graduate of and a current Associate Professor at The College of Music at Florida State University, from which I retired in 2003.)I purchased this CD for my older daughter and family who live in Germany. Once they received it, they had nothing but rave reviews for the album, the selections and the performances.I recommend this and all of Marcus's CDs and guarantee that you will not be disappointed!"
4,A Big Surprise,"I first heard this album on NPR, on the Michelle Martin show. It was so unusual I had to have it. It is a big pleasant surprise and I would strongly recommend it to any one looking for an unusual Christmas albutm"
3,They were madly brave,"They were madly brave, I remember them from the action at Guisa in November 1958, and write about them in my manuscript in preparation ""Narrations of War in Cuba.""It does not detract from their honor that they were excited by battle to the extent of making love when underfire.The fact that this book ""Marianas en Combate"" is a propaganda vehicle does not minimize from their courage.My memory of them on that hill at Guisa swaggering in their tight trousers while under a sparse rain of bullets conjures a memory as sharp today as fifty years ago. That image is something this old man will take to his death bed. I know one day their full story will be told."
4,review for apples to apples jr. ...,This game I got for christmas a few years ago. It is so much fun! It has been in and out of the game box at least 200 times!
4,"Good game, but small version","My family loves Apples to Apples. The rules are simple, but it's lots of fun to play. I bought this set on-line for my sons' friend, and was disappointed to see that the game only came with half the cards that Apples to Apples Junior contains, for the same price."
5,Great game for all ages -- even the kid version,This game is a great game for kids of all ages. I love this version for those times when you have a variety of kids playing together. This crosses that 8 to 18 barrier that sometimes comes when trying to get different age kids to play the same game together.
4,game for grandparents down to toddlers,"I spent a lot of money this Christmas trying to find a game we could play that would include the 3, 5 and 7 year old grandchildren. We tried six different games with varying degrees of failure. Then we opened up the Apples to Apples. I bought both the adult & children's version and, to tell you the truth, we could almost have played either. The children's version is geared to seven year olds but the five year old had no problems & the 3 year olds were fine on Daddy's lap helping. Even the adult child who hates games loved this one! My only complaint is that I wish there were pictures so the youngest could play without an adult partner. Children need to have reading skills to play the junior version and it wouldn't take much of anything to add a picture. Still, we had a wonderful Christmas evening playing the game with the entire family sitting around the dining room table and you just can't buy that!"
5,Apples to Apples Kids,We enjoyed playing this over at a friend's house and just had to have it. Very entertaining if you don't get too serious about what is being matched because there's no telling what's going through the other person's head.
1,Not such a good deal,"The younger kids thought this game was too confusing and hard; the older kids thought it was dopey. The games turned into popularity contests complete with tears and hurt feelings. I also bought the adult version of this game and all the adult members of my family think that's dopey too. We keep ""accidentally"" leaving it at someone else's house to get rid of it."
1,not the original book,"I have an original copy of this book and wanted to get a new copy. When I opened it and began to look, there had been many changes made to it. It is not C.H.Spurgeon's original work. Someone has taken his writing and changed it much and then put his name on it. Even the original translation of the Bible that he used has been changed.I can not recommend this book."
5,I h..e..a..r..t Trumpet Concertos!,Wynton Marsalis' execution and interpretations of the works of these three minikin musical greats are spot on! I love trumpet concertos and have played this CD a dozen time since I received it. I'll probably have to purchase another one soon as this will be worn down in no time.
2,Technically perfect but no soul,"Marsalis is an astounding trumpeter and his technique leaves you speachless. The interpretation however lacks spirit. It is cold, it has no soul, it's not sexy. The balance in this studio recording is strange and sounds unnatural. Smooth violins, but the other instruments are distant (flute, cembalo). A record that you would give to your neighbour who just started to play the trumpet. That should shut him up!"
5,Lots of vital info,"Ted Weiman' s Warrior Speed is crammed with information that will help you get that coveted attribute sought after by every martial artist- speed. The author researched and experimented in the areas of physiology, kinesiology and psychology to learn and then document in this book ways to enhance speed of movement, perception and reaction. He has filled the pages with techniques, tactics, and exercises that, when applied with diligence, will bring out your maximum speed. As an author of 12 books on the martial arts, I highly recommend Warrior Speed."
5,The Best Book on the Topic,"As a trained martial artist with over 25 years experience in Chinese, Korean, American and Philippino arts as well as degrees in Chemistry and Engineering, I think that Ted Weimann's book is the best out there for developing speed as well as maintaining conditioning in middle age and after. His detailed discussion of musculature, its operation, and the keys to maximizing better speed performance without the use of supplements is inspiring in an age when mass and weight seem to be the main priority for young athletes. Also, his discussion of the effects of aging on athletic performance, and how to forestall the effect, will be a great benefit to any individual who desires to keep a maximum level of fitness as they grow older.You can't go wrong by owning this book!"
5,A total understanding of his work!,It is very evident that he understands and has researched this topic. It is a bit overwhelming at some places and may take a couple readings to cover but it is well worth it. It is a book that every martial artist should have.
2,And then it died.,"I am a Mac user and every time I switch functions on this printer (i.e. to scan/copy), it needs to be reinstalled on the computer or it won't print again. After 2 years of ink-guzzling use, it has developed an error message implying it has a paper jam. It does not. My only option, per canon, it to take it to be repaired for $80 since it is out of warranty. And now I know why the world is full of so much electronics garbage; poor customer service and poor products that are not designed to last.I will say, when it worked it printed nicely."
2,Dead before age 3; Mediocre Prints,"I purchased the Canon MP510 in August 2007, my first Canon and first multi-function printer. It died this week for no apparent reason, having sat in the same place for about a year (34 mos since it was purchased). During its lifespan it 'did the job' of printing satisfactorily. I rarely printed photos, and when I did, found the quality well below that of my previous Epson printers. Even black-on-white printing was substandard. The MP510 is an ink-guzzler, too. Scanning and copying were fine for our home purposes.Generally, I love Canon products but the replacement will likely NOT be a Canon."
2,Does not hold up,I bought this printer for my daughter attending and college and liked it so much I bought one for myself. Neither of us used it on a regular basis and they both quit feeding paper at the same time - about 1-1/2 years later. Very frustrating since we both had just bought new ink.
4,Incomplete support for Linux and Ink cartridge recogniztion problem,"I bought this printer to use with a PC on which I am running Ubuntu (debian Linux variant). Canon has put out drivers for Linux for all their printers. Unfortunately they dont work very well for this particular one. The color printing comes out with different colors scaled differently. I had to buy a $39 print driver called Turbo print, which works quite well. Scanner works fine with Scangear. The printer itself is very good. If you however print out quick low quality photos, you will find if you look closely that the picture has bands. This does not happen if you choose higher quality printing.After a few months of use some of the color ink cartridges are still half full but, now I have a ink cartridge recognition problem. The printer is basically not usable at this point."
4,Top Notch Resource,One of the best single resources for cover letter help. The new edition is an excellent update. This is the kind of material you plagiarize.
1,It broke quickly.,It broke the second time I used it. Flimsy plastic at a critical stress point was the problem. Don't buy.
1,Broke on the 1st use. Don't waste your money.,It broke the 1st time i tried to scrape ice off my windshield. The scraping blade broke into many pieces and is worthless as a scrapper now. I give it one star for the brush.
1,Looked used,The snowbrush was cracked and looked used. The bristles had what looked like dirt all over it. I am still using my old dirty one over this.
2,Skip this and wait for the Playstation/PC version,"I've had the original Namco Galaga/Galaxian Game Boy cartridge for quite a while, and it's one of my favorite games on this platform. I was curious about the new Galaga and picked it up... thankfully, I didn't spend *too* much money on it. The new Game Boy Galaga is a staggering disappointment. There is almost no challenge to it, with more time having been spent on the scrolling background graphics than on actual game play. The original Galaga cartridge demands a lot of the player. This new edition only demands that you stay awake (hey, sometimes it's hard!). The Playstation/PC version will certainly be much better than this, so save your money and wait for that one."
3,Unanswered Riddle,"Brutal,, shocking and ritualistic murders throw J.P. Beaumount and his new partner, Sue Danielson into an investigation that has more questions than answers. Else Didriken disappeared from Beau's life thirty years earlier to return as the widow of one of the victims.The pace is pure Jance, but the trip is convoluted and many threads never unravel the reader is left wondering if a sequel is planned or if answers were dropped on the cutting room floor.LYING IN WAIT is a fair read for J.P.'s fans.Writing as a Small BusinessHaintsTravelers"
3,Lying in Wait,"As a recent JA Jance fan, I have read all but her latest 'Breach of Duty"". This was my least favorite. The storyline had too many nooks and crannies (false leads)- normally the spice of Beaumont - which were focused on for far too long. It is lovely that the names in this book got there by making charitable donations - but perhaps the size of the donation correlated directly with the amount of focus which maybe lead to this ""lull"" time?"
3,A Fast JP Beaumont Read,"While I much prefer Beaumont to Jance's other character Joanna Brady, this Beaumont novel falls a bit flat. It's fast paced. The story becomes a bit predictable. The twists in the story are just not surprising enough. It's an oldie (1994). It's worth a quick read, just don't look for a major thriller in this one"
2,"Humorous, but slightly disappointed","I was given this book as a gift and read it in two sittings (its a quick read). While I like the ""snippet"" style of writing, I found the book annoying. Many of the etiquette topics were repeated not once, but two or three times (i.e. how to approach the ""no kids"" policy and gift registry manners) which left me wishing for a wider breadth of issues to review and/or wacky wedding stories to read.As a graphic designer I pay attention to the layout and typesetting more than others, but I found the many different type treatments of the blurbs confusing. I also felt the design was a bit dated.I do give the author E for effort, though."
3,Tasty but not a chocolite bar,"I purchased this Aero bar thinking it was similar to the now long-gone Chocolite bar that I enjoyed as a kid in the 70's/80's. It has air bubbles in the bar and although it is tasty, it is not the same as the Chocolite bar was. The taste was ok but hard to eat, as it kind of falls apart where the bubbles are. As far as the shipping, there were no problems. In fact, it arrived very quickly and in great condition. Hope this helps."
2,aero or chocolite?,"I read that the aero bar tasted similar to the choclite bar. Upon trying the aero bar I came to the conclusion that the chocolite bar is the better candy bar. Nothing comes close, I wish they would start making the chocolite bar again.I'm deeply saddend :("
4,"good visuals, but pretentious narration","This DVD is very good at giving the viewer a true sense of traveling on some of the finest trains in the world. Unlike some train travel vids, this one focuses as much on the train itself as it does on destination and sights en route. On lesser trains that might be tedious, but here it is very welcome. One drawback: everyone interviewed is falling over themselves to tell you how 'faaaabulous' the train is. By the third episode, I started mocking them in Monty Python voices. I checked the prices for these journeys on the internet and they are certainly pricey, so I can understand their desire to make them sound luxurious (which they are). But they lay it on way too thick. I found myself hitting the mute button whenever they paused to interview staff."
2,PoE listed not compatible,"The D-Link DWL-P200 Power Over Ethernet Adapter listed in October of 09 as the 'Frequently Bought Together' item is not compatible with the BB-HCM531A. Come on Amazon, get your accessories right before you recommend them."
3,technology is outdated,Here's the deal. I'm not an i t specialist but this is what my guy told me about the camera. 1. active x is a product of microsoft so you pretty much have to use internet explorer to use camera effectively...most people do not have internet explorer on their smart phones. 2. wep vs.wpa?? not sure about what that means in technology speak but if you intend on recording with a p c on a network using the wireless capability of the camera you will be very vulnerable. 3. recording with one camera is possible without buying additional software but you are not able to export the image with out additional software which I think is discontinued. If I had to do it again I would buy a more up to date camera and would commit a lot of time reviewing the software provided by the manufactuer.
4,Real soundtrack music,"It seems that, what with the sweeping Wagnerian style of John Williams, all soundtrack composers are expected to turn every little snippet of music into a suite, or two.The reality is that soundtracks are supposed to serve the film they were composed for. And so it is with this score.It is repetative, and you have to hunt for the really choice parts, but that is the nature of scoring for film.One of the compensations is the Hungarian National Orchestra,who are right on top of things. They played like the pros they are."
5,listen carefully,Yonder rocks. This album is another of their well-captured live shows and is deffinitely good tunes. Go see them in concert.
5,The only strategy game that ever mattered.,"This is THE word in strategy gaming. I find it hard to believe that anyone who has been playing war games for very long has missed this one. In my opinion, this is the best game ever made, for any platform. Civilization is based on the original game ""Empire"" by interstel. In ""Empire"" you controlled armies that invaded foreign lands - discovering as you conquered. In Civilizations I and II, you build an empire from the ground up. Political, economic, scientific, military, and social issues abound. If I were to encounter an alien who did not understand anything about human culture, I would give him/her a copy of Civ II with a Pentium 300 and check back with them in 3 months.Unfortunately they would probably have taken over the world by then....Shawn"
5,Hard to get bored of this game,"I've been playing Civ since 1995, when I first managed to get a copy of the original game.I like to compare Civ with the movie The Godfather. I think Civ was to strategy gaming what The Godfather was to gangster movies. However, Godfather Part II is a more epic movie. Well, so is Civ 2. A much more complex game, that fully beats Civ!I've been playing for 9 years, and I still enjoy one whole night playing a Civ 2 game.Civ 2 has changed me so much as a game, and I would rank among the best ones.P.S. Godfather Part III wasn't so good, so isn't Civ 3 mainly because it is slow. Civ 2 goes right into the game right off the bat."
5,Civilization 2,"Great. My teacher put it on the computer at school and all the boys love it. Good planning and stratagey are a key to this game. Kids in my class even went out and bought the game. If he finds the game, he will buy some and sell it to the boys."
4,Golden Oldie,"For pos computer's like mine Civ2 runs blazing fast. Yeah it is old and yeah civ3, 4 and so on rock...BUT this started it and if you have to get a Civ fix and you are poor or seriously out-of-date this is the game for you. It really IS fun."
1,Disrespectful,"It is disrespectful to get a costume in these conditions, costume broken,loose threads, poor quality, size less than publicated. I paid addditonal shipping to my country Colombia to receive this costume,I had to run to buy a new costume the night before halloween. Its a shame amazon has these products in its catalogue."
1,Poor Quality,This costume looks great in the picture but when I received it I was very disappointed. The quality is poor and the arms did not look like they would fit a doll let alone a child. The hat was flimsy and looked like the anchor was drawn on with a crayon. I returned this item and still had to pay for postage and handling fees. I would not reccomend this costume.
3,Mixed Feelings About This Title,"Watching this tape, there is no doubt about Father Stan's love for Christ and the Mass. His enthusiasm overflows on this tape. You will learn a lot from this tape and will come to appreciate the Mass more. This said however, there are some problems. The video quality is fair to poor and its hard to watch. The sound quality is even worse. They simply used the mic from the camcorder and picked up the sound in the church. Its a shame that the form of the piece comes into play but it makes it hard to watch at one sitting. Don't expect profession quality and you will not be dissapointed. Just be prepared for some stories not related to topic at hand (Father Stan likes to go off on tangents."
4,Undeservedly Obscure,"With the exception of Tornado Weather, which seems to drone on for far longer than 4:32, The Blacklight Trap is another excellent album by Milton Mapes, a band that deserves a bigger audience and a much higher national profile. As on Westernaire, I like the ballads best here, especially Bowie AZ and Craters of the Moon, a simply beautiful love song. Nothing on the CD rocks, but even as the songs are slow, the band can get a little noisy and that is welcome on the first two cuts and the Rudyard Kipling reference, When the Earth's Last Picture is Painted. In the interest of full disclosure, while it doesn't bother me, band leader Greg Vanderpool has a nasal vocal style that may grate on some ears.If you like alt-country, Texas music, but haven't heard of Milton Mapes, they are definitely worth an impulse purchase."
5,Best Children's Book Ever,"I still have my original copy of The Wish Tree by John Ciardi (from 1962)-- to this day, it's one of my all-time favorite books. The word carved over the door in the tree trunk (""TAKECAREOFYOURWISH"") haunts me even today when I'm faced with life's greater decisions :) If you don't have this book, get it."
2,"dont read, watch!",dont read a book to learn stuff like this. watch video tutorials! there are tons of websites offering video tutorials. look 'em up!
5,LIBERALS WORST NIGHTMARE,"Savage you are 110% correct!!!! This book is a must read for everyone who calls themselves ""patriotic Americans."" Savage speaks the truth and the liberals are scared. Thats why in their reviews all they can do is whine and call Savage ""rascist"" and ""gay-hater."" Savage is a wonderful author and an even better talk-show host. I suggest anyone who enjoyed his book to tune in to his show. There is nothing I enjoy more than some idiotic liberal who calls his show and tries to argue with the master himself. Thanks Savage!"
5,Right wing right way,"This is a book you can judge by its cover.The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help me God.Oh, I offended you, so,so sorry. Thank you, Savage for writing it.The USA rocks!"
3,This is good book.,This is good book. I is conservative. I like to read. Bill Clinton is bad man. I don't like him. He does bad things. George Bush is good. He does good things. I vote for him. I is conservative. I like to read.
1,This guy is a crazy old loon.,"I have come to the conclusion that Michael Savage is mentally ill. His rantings and rhetoric are simply bizaare, and he comes across as a cartoon caricature of a typical conservative. His book ""The Enemy Within"" is typical of the Republican Taliban and its efforts to turn America into a theocracy like Saudi Arabia, a Republican's dream country."
2,okay...i guess....,"michael savage is very very angry about a lot of things... he's probably still mad about the holocoust... i do hope that savage realizes that everyone is a liberal then they turn conservative... everyone has a stage where they don't like the way something is going and they change it... then they get old and die conservative (or liberal if they do something really stupid)... i guess everyone, no matter what, can write a book... if the media is liberal, how do conservative books keep getting published?.... oh well...."
2,Sometimes Entertaining But Very Loose With Facts,"Savage (nee Michael Weiner) can't seem to make up his mind whether he's an arch conservative or a liberal. Although he professes to hate the latter, he does have some liberal values among his core beliefs. Mostly, however, I think he's just schtick -- saying or writing whatever he needs to for ratings. Unlike Limbaugh Hannity and their imitators, he's not a shill for big money. He's more of a crochity xenophobe, with a touch of decency and liberalism.Just be careful about his ""facts."" Recently I heard him talk about the 400,000 Russian casualties in taking Berlin at the end of WWII. He mentioned this a few times, so I bothered to read the Battle of Berlin and Savage was wildly wrong. He also overlooked important facts that contradicted the parallel he was trying to draw between the Battle of Berlin and the U.S. invasion of Iraq.Bottom line -- don't buy the book."
1,"The elite ownership-class who owns and control the Schools, Military, and ""Faith"" are not liberal at all.","The elite ownership-class who owns and control the Schools, Military, and ""Faith"" are not liberal at all.The Bilderberg Group is not ""liberal"" at all."
5,Every American should read this book,Savage tells it like it is. This is an excellent book especially for recent college grads who have no idea as to the extent of thier socialist brainwashing.If you're looking for a book that will forever change the way you view the world - look no further. This is it!
4,How do they like it?,"To me, people like Michael Savage are just what the Right needs; for DECADES the Left has employed the ""politics of attack."" Now, finally, people like Savage and Colmes and Coulter have had enough and have decided to play the Left's dirty game, and the left doesn't like it!"
5,passion,Only a book that hits close to the truth could inspire as much passion as the previous reviews. After reading the Savage Nation I find Michael well educated and insightful. I also fear for this country because of the politically correctness prevailent in our society. I can't wait to read The Enemy Within
1,"Plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose","Readers who enjoyed this book may also enjoy a book by the same title written by Wm. J. Simmons, founder of the modern Ku Klux Klan:America's Menace: or the Enemy Within (1926)http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00085M8V6/qid=1122117841/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-3837993-1755823?v=glance&s;=books"
2,Not worth the money,"I like to listen to Savage once in awhile. He is intellectually dishonest, but that's okay. This book appears to be typed up transcripts of his radio show. It works better on the radio than it does in print."
4,Savage is RIGHT ON !!!,"Politically I consider myself an independent. Obviously Savage is a very conservative Republican and his views model the party platform and perhaps go even further to the right. However, Savage is RIGHT ON THE MONEY when he speaks of the ills in our country being directly linked to liberalism. From the anti-God , anti-family ACLU to the king pins of the Democratic party, our schools, military and democracy are all being threatened by these shady people. There are far too few conservative voices on the radio and television these days. Time and Newsweek mags are dripping wet with the stench of liberalism. Finally we have Savage, Hannity, O'Riely and others who are challenging the liberal left and standing up for the conservative ""mainstream"" America. THIS BOOK IS DEFINITELY WORTH READING!!!dhansen@novell.com"
3,Savage Solutions,"Excellent points raised, though I can't agree with all. Extreme talk from the right without solid thought out solutions is lacking, and overall harmful to the very issues Michael is trying to bring to the attention of his audience. Substantiated facts, dates, and documentation are also short. As a Independent Conservative, I find much on the mark. However, I feeel his ""society"" goes a little too far to the right for my taste - and would be happy to expound on those points of weakeness with Michael, as they serve to limit his possible audience. I don't think he's hard enough on some of our ""so called"" Conservatives in office and their lack of backbone. I'd hate to see him turn into a character like ""the other"" Radio host - that fat two-faced phoney pill popper! Remember Michael -Power corrupts, and asolute power corrupts - absolutely (just ask Rush, Jerry Falwell, or Jim Baker - to name a few who made it on radio)."
3,"Intelligent arguments, but ultimately self-defeating","Dr. Savage makes several good points in his book assailing modern liberalism; however, too often he relies on hyperbole and insults to make his point and his credibility takes a hit. His statistics on funding for HIV/AIDS versus other diseases was eye-opening."
1,The Enemy Within- has there ever been a more ironically titled book?,"What is evil?Evil is a man of high intelligence, verbally gifted, with good critical thinking skills, who willfully and knowingly makes a career out of inciting the latent fear and hatred lurking within us all. Evil is loving fame and money so much that this man finds a niche spreading the most hateful, paranoid, and violence-inducing propaganda imaginable, which he himself does not believe. Evil is this man using his verbal skills and intelligence to cloak this poisonous rhetoric in the garb of patriotism and religion."
1,"There are More productive ways of ""Saving America""","This book is full of hate and ignorance. It's the same angry fear injecting stuff that is being regurgitated by so many others. I've been looking for an anti-progressive book with substance (I like to keep myself in check with good counterpoints to my own beliefs,) but sadly have not found one for a long time. My advice would be to save your money. Better yet use your money to help your church, give a phone card to a soldier, or buy some school supplies for a child who cannot aford them. This would be a much more productive way of ""Saving America...Our Schools, Faith, and Military."
1,The Enemy Within,"I read about 3 chapters in this book and thought it was terribly crude. I don't usually throw a book in the trash, but this one made to ""file 13""."
1,"Moronic, lies and half-truths - the Right will love it!","Hard to believe that this idiot has a radio show, gets published and has a devoted following. I borrowed this book from a friend and found myself laughing at something on every page. Clearly written for the wacko Right, this book has no coherent thought process or supporting facts. But, judging by the comments, the wackos love it - somewhere Savage is laughing as he rakes in the cash and calling all his Savage Nation ""suckers!"""
2,This guy makes me laugh!,"Michael Savage is an entertaining man. I really get a good laugh when he's about to pop an artery over a topic that drives him nuts. On radio, his incessant daily rantings about ""The enemy within"" and ""red doper diaper babies"" is hilarious. Thankyou for writing a book that both Liberals and Conservatives can laugh about with equal enthusiasm. Other conservative books are boring, by comparision.Here's a tip: if you don't find humor in one of his chapters, just picture in your mind Michael Savage spewing his hatred while wearing one of Arafat's head-dresses...they'd look like twins ferrchissakes! Sorry about that, Yasser.Hey, why did he change his name from Michael Weiner to Michael Savage? Inferiority complex? Wouldn't be taken seriously? Didn't work!"
4,If I were a liberal...,"If I were a liberal, I'd have probably given this book two stars as well. Great read...really good insight on what the left is missing."
2,Better than his first book,"I read Savage Nation, and Enemy Within. The problem with enemy within is that Savage generalizes a lot. He thinks everyone in Marin Co. is liberal, like when he complains about the college student in line in the restaurant. This generalization is coming from a conservative living in the Bay Area. He also generalizes liberals as judges, even though he doesnt know their ideology.Savage does has a bibliography in this book - so it is more respected than Savage Nation.The book is slanted, but Savage voices his opinion."
5,Super,bought 2 different kinds of deburring tools to try them out this one had a big groove down the middle of each triangle side and the other one I purchased did not just something different
1,"I bought, I read, and I donated","I did try very hard to read on, but this book involved H.K. and Chinese, again, inevitably and totally blew me out of water! Sorry, too ridiculous and outlandish. After tried and failed to finish, I finally donated it to the local library; maybe my poisoned egg-roll was someone else's double cheese burger, I couldn't care less and in the meantime, to love this author with joy."
3,5-year limitation on connected equipment guarantee,"Overall this surge protector has nice features including three widely spaced outlets for transformers, two separate protected coax circuits, a six foot cord with flat profile plug, and an easy to read indicator of grounding status and proper functioning of the surge protection capability.However, you may need to replace it in five years, because the connected equipment guarantee is limited to five years from the date of purchase - not for lifetime as some other surge protectors. You also need to have receipts for the damaged equipment as well as the surge protector."
2,Nice to look at for the first 10 minutes or so,"but it gets old pretty quickly after that. The terrain looks good and the controls are very easy to operate. But there aren't any combat missions; your entire selection of combat options are dogfighting against either one or two enemy planes. Most of the game consists of target shooting, flying around courses and shooting at baloons. This might be a good choice for a younger child who just wants to fly around some nice scenery and maybe learn to land the plane on the runway. I played it a total of about 2 hours and lost interest."
5,A superb ending to a fantastic trilogy!,"The wonderful Circle trilogy is finally complete...and it was well worth the wait. This trilogy is a MUST READ! Suspenseful, insightful, fast-paced, and certainly life-impacting. Ted Dekker is a master of bringing Truth close to home, in a way that causes us the readers to see and feel it in a fresh way...Black, Red, and White paint a picture of mortal life, redemption, and spiritual life that will draw you in and leave you glad to have been a part of the journey!"
5,Best ever!,This triology is absolutely the best I have ever read. A cross between C.S. Lewis and Frank Peritti.
4,The circle trilogy,"Very enjoyable read - you can read each on its own, but it makes for a good series"
4,A satisfying end,"The trilogy's final sequence will convince my doubting friends that Dekker is actually a Christian writer. The intensity doesn't ease up, and the last chapter is so completely fitting! The whole series embraces JPII's Theology of the Body in its defining of relationship. Fascinating!"
2,Thin and thinner,"The trilogy began interestingly enough and by the end of the first of the three, I was engaged. And then we began our descent into facile, paper thin allegory.I appreciate the effort Mr. Dekker has made in creating a Christian science fiction. Unfortunately, his understanding of Christianity is closer to the current State religion than to any basic biblical approach. Shallow moralisms allow the death of thousands without any qualms.But, to the literature. Characters are 2 dimensional at best. Inconsistencies are glossed over. Passages and sentences are repeated in a way that makes one think that this was a group effort over the burning light of a word processor.Limpingly bad, like watching a train wreck over 3 volumes."
5,Exceptional Series,"All the things I love all in one place ~ Spirituality ~ Science Fiction ~ Time Travel/Alternate Reality combined with Romance, Suspense and Intrigue. What a series! I was lucky to read all three books at once without having to wait. I zoomed through them and was very pleased with the ending as sad as I was to see it. Ted Dekker has an incredible gift of going where no one has ever been and taking you with him. I am a new fan and highly recommend this book. Be sure and start with ""Black"" first!"
5,My favorite of the first three,"White is my favorite of the original trilogy. Haven't read Green yet, but I thoroughly enjoyed White. Such wonderful pictures of courage, love, and honor. Five stars."
4,I came away much richer for these three books,"Redemption became much clearer but I wasn't quite prepared to face sacrificial love. I came away much richer for having completed this trilogy.Ray Ruppert, Author of ""The Sovereign Reigns, or Does He?"" ""The Sovereign's Last Battle"" and ""Revelation: A Layperson's Reflections"""
5,Delicious Healty Biscotti Cookie,"Choconut is my favorite Almondina cookie. The Chocolate taste is very satisfying. Almondina cookies are low in fat and have NO trans fats or saturated fats, so are better than many other cookies. Highly recommended!"
4,Great easy bread,Just as easy to prepare as the package says. Just need a good loaf pan and great bread is only 40 mins away.
5,Good whole grain taste,Tried this bread tonight and I'm in LOVE. Easy to prepare - just add water and bake. My dh said it tasted like the bread I used to bake way back when. Love the healthy ingredients. I did the math and each loaf is $3.00. Much better than the expensive brands at the grocery. A little crumbly for sandwiches though. New input: add an egg to the water before mixing. Makes the bread less crumbly.
4,Long Live The Irish!,"We bought McCann's Quick Bread, Irish Brown. We bought the Pyrex the same day with the perfect size to bake the Bread and the rest is history. We are sold and bought for! Our very first bread met all our expectations and Big Mama ate it all in just about a blink of an eye. We also have this product on Subscribe & Save (every 3 months) and it is tasty. The preparation and the baking worked as instructed and the cooling period was shortened by half for Big Mama was marking time and ready to go! Never knew about this bread but because I am always hungry and looking for what's out there and because Amazon has a way to point things out, I found it. No disrespect intended with 4 Stars, I would have gladly given it 4.5 for the convenience, taste and value. Great Bread and Long Live The Irish!"
5,Excellent music and video for kids,"The music is an excellent way to teach your child (and yourself) Bible texts, and listening to it over and over again hasn't driven the adults in our home crazy...on the contrary, we all enjoy it as much as the kids do. The DVD is great to watch too, although it is definitely geared to school aged kids, as opposed to the second volume DVD which is great for preschoolers as well as older kids.When it comes to Steve Green's music for kids, you can't go wrong. Everyone in the family will enjoy it."
5,very meaningful,"There are very few cds and dvds out there that teach bible verses, in a meaningful and not odd way. This is definitely at the top."
4,solid scripture cd dvd,"This cd/dvd is straight from the bible. scripture verse made into songs just as the description says. the dvd is pretty outdated...stone washed jeans, crazy hair cuts ect. but, as fars as the content it is EXCELLENT."
5,Roland and Curt are back!,"I've recently heard a few tracks from this forthcoming record (out Sept. 14, 2004). This is incredible stuff! It's as if Roland and Curt haven't missed a beat in 15 years. I can't wait for the full album release! In the meantime, check out some of the tracks on the official site (www.tearsforfears.net)"
5,A great read for investors of all types.,"An easy-to-read book. No matter what your level of expertise in the stock market, the investor will get extremely useful information from this excellent work. Appears to be extremely well-researched and thoroughly covers the contrarian approach to buying stocks. Particularly worth reading during this time of extreme volatility are the passages on past market manias, which give some neat histories of investing bubbles and remind us how the masses can sometimes get carried away. The well-structured rules provide a framework that can only help any investor embrace the contrarian approach. The breezy, conversational writing makes this a really fun read which is well worth the time for anyone who is a student of the stock market. An A-plus."
1,I expected much more!,"The claim to fame of the book is to buy stocks down atleast 50% from their 52 week high and to look for insider buying at these levels.While good advice its far from perfect nor very insightful or original. I think contrarian investing is a very interesting topic that has huge potential, so when I read this the authur made no attempt to prove his superior insight in to the markets."
5,Contrarian = Value,"Contrarian investing is not simply investing against the crowd. It is investing against the crowd when the crowd is wrong and overreacting. At the start of this book the author says, ""Investing is a strange business. It's the only one we know of where the more expensive the products get, the more customers want to buy them. That doesn't happen with a car, a house, or a VCR. Usually, people shop for bargains."" This one quote says it all.This book is simply about value investing with the title Contrarian Investing. Being a value investor is not simple because one has to be willing to pull the trigger when the majority of other investors have the opposite view of the market. I really liked this book because in my opinion, the investment philosophy described in this book is the best way to invest.- Mariusz Skonieczny, author of Why Are We So Clueless about the Stock Market? Learn how to invest your money, how to pick stocks, and how to make money in the stock market"
2,'taint Recycled...,"This ain't Recycled, in fact it's not prog either, it's ... This outfit should have stayed retired. This outing not only sounds dated but is one cliche after another. The lyrics are equally useless. For contemporary prog worth obtaining turn to Yes (Magnification), Camel (Rajaz), Oliver Wakeman (3 Ages of Magick), Flower Kings, Ian Anderson & co., Museo Rosenbach (No Exit), Steve Howe (Natural Timbre), Tomas Bodin or Transatlantic but not these fellas, their done. Stick a fork in 'em. ...the truth is this recording is bloody awful. With all the good prog out there you should give this one a pass."
2,Obee don't know me,"It's obvious: ""Obiwanbeeohbee"" is a putz. Stop criticizing the critic! Everyone is entitled to his/her own tastes. Let's face it, these ""citical reviews"" have become nothing more than chat rooms, venues for adoring fans to make fools of themselves with lavish verbose praise. But to take such a vitriolic attitude towards a reviewer who is simply expressing a personal opinion is too close to fascism for my taste. Vent your spleen somewhere else or lighten up. There ARE more important things in the world young man.By the way, I agree with Mr. Delahanty's assessment. The music is forced & disjointed with no identifiable connecting theme. But no one's perfect. I'll bide my time until the next album appears."
2,"Oh, how I wanted this to succeed...","I ""found"" Nektar when I was in college. An impressionable period, right? Well, I was impressed! So much so that I purchased all of Nektar's albums. I still enjoy listening to them; it's one of the reasons I recently replaced my old turntable. Their music conjours up fond memories. But not this album. It is disjointed & forced. Noting that they have just released a reunion CD, I am sadly fearful that they took a look around &, borrowing a Cranberries title, thought ""Everyone else is doing it, so why can't we"".Having said that, I offer this disclaimer: It's only my opinion. Taste is a very individual thing. I'll take a Three Stooges short over Citizen Kane almost any day..."
4,Objective and Respectful,"Alfred Metraux's study of Haitian vaudou is as comprehensive as one can imagine an outsider can achieve. The book covers the history, social framework, gods, spirits, and loa, rituals, magic, and what The Church thinks. There are antecdotal stories that illustrate the powers and beliefs of vaudou practitioners. Metraux's direct observations are ususally imparted without condescension. I found the writing to be scholarly as well as approachable and entertaining. An excellent resource for those interested in this misunderstood Creole religion."
4,"Straight, objective anthropological overview of Vodoun","This, and Zora Neale Hurston's <I>Tell My Horse: Voodoo in Haiti and Jamaica</I>, are probably the best straight-up objective studies of Voodooism as it is seriously practiced. This books gives the reader the ""white anthropologist's"" point of view, and is somewhat more objective than Hurston's book. Not making any judgements abotu the religion, all it gives is 100+ pages of defintive facts in the forms of text anf images."
4,excellent early anthropological work,"One of the first, if not the very first serious scholarly work on the voodoo religion in Haiti. No lies about human sacrifice or horror stories about cannibalism, just an excellent anthropological text. This and Zora Neale Hurston's ""Tell My Horse"" are an excellent introduction to Voodoo as it was practiced in the first half of the 20th century"
3,"voodoo, Haiti, Diaspora religion","One cannot dispute the scholarship in this work or its basic content. It is a classic and a good primer in many ways. It is a bit dated in its attitude towards voodoo as a collection of cults. Today it regarded as the national religion of Haiti and is seen as valid in that it has a clear core of ceremony, priesthood, and belief with many variations. -a fine book overall."
1,Almost every single recipe contains at least one trigger!,"I am following the 1-2-3 Migraine Prevention diet (book ""Heal your Headache, Buchholz). My entire lifestyle has changed since I have been on this diet (but have cut my migraines almost 80%!)and it has been extremely challenging to cut out all the migraine dietary triggers, so when I found this Migraine Cookbook, I thought it was going to make things a lot easier. However, I don't think I can eat a single recipe in this book! The author even points many (not all) dietary triggers and still continues to use these ingredients in most/nearly all of her recipes. I am quite disappointed and do NOT recommend this book to others trying on this diet."
1,deceiving,"This book is deceiving as it has many trigger foods in a lot of the recipes. The author is suppose to be an expert on migraines, if I am not mistaken, so I was surprised. There are a lot of recipes that include mushrooms, which have a naturally occurring form of msg, but these recipes are marked to not have msg. Glad I bought it used and did not spend much money on it, as I don't think I will be using it much, if at all. The recipes that are free of my triggers are rather complex. People with migraines, especially people with chronic migraines like me, need more simple recipes, at least in my opinion. My advice is to save your money! Figure out your triggers, then just surf the net for different recipes. The Food Network has a lot of goo ones!"
4,"Good ol' boys, good ol' music!","A variety of music to capture whatever mood you're in. Sultry and intense guitar playing, good vocal harmonizing and an awesome keyboard/organ captivates your attention. Can't wait to hear the next cd!"
2,babe ruth book,nice book but thought it was a little childish...thought it would be more autobiograsphical...reminded me of a formal comic book
1,Nearly worthless,"This book desperately needs to be updated and rewritten! I brought it along on a bicycle trip the length of Yunnan in the spring of 2005, but found the information extremely outdated and nearly worthless. None of the hotel and restaurant listings were useable, and the sights were poorly described. The writing also failed to capture a sense of the place. I found Lonely Planet's South-West China (2002) far superior; unfortunately this book is getting old and Lonely Planet does not plan a new edition. Lonely Planet's China (2005) skips over some of the best places--such as the southeast--of Yunnan. Yunnan is a marvellous place to visit, but needs a comprehensive, up-to-date, well-written guidebook. The 2001 Bradt guide isn't it."
2,Lots of Inaccuracies,"We are living in Yunnan Province for this year so we were excited to find a guidebook targeted at Yunnan, especially one that was published only a few months before our departure. The book has however been a huge disappointment! Prices are very inaccurate (often off by a factor of 10), many of the maps are inaccurate and the level of detail is poor. Sometimes it feels like the authors have never been to the places they are describing. We have stopped carrying this book with us. We prefer the Lonely Planet China Southwest."
3,steamy sex... poor story,"As the French say, chapeau to the writer's (a woman) ability to write long hot sex scenes between two males. Luckily enough they represent more than half of the length of the book, even if I really feel like complaining about the vision of some authors who tend to think gay men are sexually either passive or active.If you read the story quickly, enjoying the steam, you may pass it as great: unfortunately I am not able to: even in hard core books I look for quality and here the problem is characterization: Bram is just too perfect to be real, gorgeous, blue collar like, sensitive, sweet, clever, rich, etc. etc. etc.; Jamie too cub-like, defenceless, vulnerable.If the characters are not believable, the best love story grows stale.And please... will someone tell the publisher to have an editor correct all those typos? I counted I do not know how many..."
3,Please don't speak,"I thought this book would truly be a gay romance. However, what I have found is a book chock full of sex...pretty intense sex as suggested in the title. I will admit that those scenes are well written. There is so much descriptive writing that it's quite easy to visualize the characters Bram and James, as odd a couple as they may seem.What I found most frustrating about this book is the dialogue of the characters. I just can't accept some of the things that Bram says to James. Much of the dialogue is so corny and saccharine that it makes me blush with embarrassment. It's almost as if two people wrote this book; one wrote the descriptive scenes and another wrote the dialogue.The storyline itself is quite romantic in an unconventional way, and the endless occasions of sex are quite exciting, but the sappy dialogue is a definite minus for this book."
2,Not what I expected,"If you want some very hot male-male sex, read it, but that's about all you'll find. It's a fairy tale, no pun intended. Bram is perfect, James is a woman physically described as a man. Plot was predictable and insipid.Being pretty new to this genre, I usually determine what to read by the recommendations in the related Amazon threads. This book, and it's sequel Roughousing, were some that I read based on this. Thankfully, they have been the only duds so far.If you like your male-male romance to happen between true, grown-up men, stay away from this book."
2,PWP,"If you like PWP (porn without plot), this book is for you. I almost fell in boredom-induced coma."
2,Overrated in every way,"Large can certainly write a smooth and engaging narrative. But that's about all that I can recommend about this book. Large's caustic and cynical view of Berlin and Berliners is can be extremely off-putting, bordering at times on the offensive. I found his particular comment that the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church looked better after the carpet bombing of World War II than before to be extremley offensive, especially in light of how many thousands of Berlin's civilians were killed during that particular episode of ""architectural improvement.""Add to this that the book seems to lack any sort of historical context, placing artistic, social and political movements apart from similar movements that were sweeping through other European cities of the time, and I find it very difficult to recommend this book to anybody."
4,....Berlin said best....,"Once again David C. Large proposes that college required reading and a sense of humor can be assimilated. Stating that the ""Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church looked better after the carpet bombing of World War II than before"" is comical, yet sadly true! Large educates the reader about Europe's most captivating city, Berlin! He manages to not only remind us of its beauty, but that it is a romantisch city that need not be known only as the former Nazi capital. A consistent and entertaining book, an asset to history itself. Steve Newman"
1,Caddyshack Gopher,"I had previously purchased this product years ago and placed it in storage until last year. I gave it to my grandson, who played it everyday, nearly all day, for a year before it wore out. My grandson loved it. This product I purchased in June, is smaller than the first one I purchased, and stopped working after less than two months. Because of its durability to last less than a couple of months, I would not recommend it."
5,White glove treatment,"Needed washable, economical cotton gloves to wear with hand cream to fight the ravages of dry and cracking skin. Since my husband and I started using these gloves (with ointment) occasionally we have not been bothered by painful skin cracking. These gloves are just what we needed! Don't have to wear them everynight, or even all night. Just for a while! They do the job!"
1,"Very Cheap Quality, split the first time I put them on","The gloves were purchased to go with an Uncle Sam costume for Halloween - my hands are far from X-Large but I wanted to make sure there was room in them. Size was a slight bit bigger than my hands (a standard medium glove size). I slipped the glove on before the event only to watch the seam down the outter edge give way on both gloves. The entire side of both gloves just feel open. I was angry to say the least. Ended up going to a dollar store to get a better pair for the event. I will probably hand sew them and donate them to s kids group to use later.Would not recommend this product, very cheap, sizing is way off."
3,Not as polished as it could have been,"Walken is a joy to watch, but the whole movie is bland. There is no cohesive feeling of a city and its people. We do not get a flavor of the population in and out of New Orleans. The violence is too contrived and meaningless. We see no real port, just a market where the central action takes place. This is a very low budget film and it shows. The history involved is not accurate."
2,Not what I was looking for...,"I am a Christopher Walken fan and did a search using his name for movies he has been in that I might not have heard of. You know, a hidden, unseen by human eyes, jewel. To quote a famous guy ""Dis ain't it"". Chris makes a couple of good appearances but the movie is centered on corrupt politicians' attempts to lengthen their hold on the local economy by eliminating the competition through nefarious means.If you're looking for more of Chris, I'd pass."
2,For Beginners Only,"Hair Rules is good if you know absolutely nothing about taking care of your curly or kinky hair. Dickey excels at giving general advice and information about products and simple maintenance, but if you're looking for detailed instructions on how to style your hair at home, this is NOT the book for you. Dickey refuses to recommend any specific products (not even brands), so this book is even less useful than, say, a monthly women's magazine such as Essence or Shape. Also, the photos are mostly black and white, and lack any kind of detailed captions and close-ups that would help readers replicate these styles at home. Borrow it from the library or buy it used."
5,I recommend this book highly!,"I'm black too and I love this book! I still refer to it regularly. As I have been growing out my hair from its very short natural, I have found this book to be invaluble in helping me to condition and maintain my new curls. While it's possible that this book may help black women more so than others, I have had numerous conversations with my caucasian friends of wavy/curly hair and have found that our issues/solutions have been very similar. So overall I do think this book can be useful to all. I also look forward to exploring the other books mentioned by the other reviewers."
3,Hair Rules is Not for Everyone,"I purchased this book thinking it was about all women with curly hair, because the dust jacket and introduction leads you to believe that all women with curly hair can benefit from reading it. While this is probably true to some extent, its primary focus is on African American women. I would give it 3 stars for all women and 5 stars for African American women. So depending on your hair type, this book may or may not be a useful tool in caring for your curly locks."
3,"Good, but Overrated","This is a decent book, but its highly overrated. If you've bought ethnic hair care books before, you might be be disappointed by this one. If not, its a good primer for any newcomer to ethnic/afro hair care."
2,It's just common sense...,"I really wanted to like this but Hair Rules didn't tell me anything I already didn't know about caring for natural hair. I bought this at Barnes and Noble last week on a whim. Got home read the first few chapters, like Tamiko Frasier's story and how she finally went natural and skimmed the rest. Liked how the author reminds the reader to embrace their natural hair and that good hair is really clean, healthy hair, blah blah blah. The book doesn't really recommend many hair product options and I don't think it's a good idea to set hair when it's dripping wet (could get messy). I do agree that a hood dryer is better for your hair than a blow dryer but I learned of this two years ago. I guess this book did come out in 2003 but most of this is still just common sense. I returned this book the next day and glad I did."
2,For beginners,"I read this book and found it completely useless. No direction, general information that you can find off the internet and no hair styling tips. Get it from the library. Textured Tresses by Diane Da Costa was a little more useful."
3,Not for the Chem Free,"If you are a natural haired chick who believes in not putting cancer causing, drying, stripping product on your beautiful hair, then this is not the book for you. I wanted to like this one I really did! Thing is I am all about healthy hair not hair styling.. and there are sections in this book where the author downplays the danger of PARABENS and MINERAL OIL!SILICONES TOO?!? Are you kidding me? . The weave section is pretty ok for everyone though.This book is more for people who want to find product for hairstyling, not healthy hair maintenance.Black people need not apply. when our hair breaks it's GONE!"
3,Doesn't give you all the information you need,"I bought this book hoping that I would get some practical tips or ""rules"" for taking care of my natural hair. The book did not provide practical detailed advice however gave more of a history of black hair. I am sorry that I bought it."
4,HAIR RULES,Great way to get your natural hair styles started. Good information on what works and why. Not a lot of pictures though
4,LAST STAND AT SABER RIVER,"THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE, BUT HERE IS A HINT BUY IT IN THE TOM SELLECK WESTERN COLLECTION. YOU WILL NOT BE LET DOWN."
5,"Good Cast, Good Western","Tom Selleck made a couple of made-for-cable TV westerns that were very good, and this is one of them. The always-reliable Selleck is convincig in the lead role and Suzy Amis is fun to watch to in the corresponding female lead. It's also kind of neat to see a very young Haley Joel Osment two years before he became famous in ""The Sixth Sense.""Once again, as these westerns tend to be, the viewer is treated to some beautiful scenery and in addition, a good story of a man taking taking family back home to Arizona - not the north or south - after the Civil War and not finding a nice welcome from the home folks.In this film, we also get two Carradines: David and Keith, villains but not as despicable as many are shown in other westerns. The Carradine family has produced some really fine actors over the years.It's just another one of these solid, relatively-unknown westerns that I am glad to discover. It's highly-recommended."
4,A moving story honestly told,"This film is beautifully acted by all involved. The story is original and moving. Sellick is excellent, but so is everyone else. Great scenery. Sheer enjoyment."
2,You must be kidding...,"This western may have the imprimatur of the great Elmore Leonard on it, but it sure ain't no ""Lonesome Dove."" The script is full of overly-obvious plot points, acres of unsubtle exposition, and unlikely characterizations. Everybody seems to be going through the motions, including Selleck and the Carradines. I'm sorry, but this just isn't that good of a movie. I've got nothing against Selleck & Co., but you'd be much better off picking up an old Randolph Scott film, if you just want something fun to watch. (Axton)"
5,highly recommend,"Well done, good cast, different spin on storyline all add up to an entertaining and quality experience. With limited recent western releases to choose from, this one ranks with the best."
5,Another Selleck classic cowboy,"I like westerns with morals. The good guys win, the really bad guys loose, and the not so bad guys get a conscience."
4,"The Rev Barry W Green ""Down Under""","I mentioned ""Last Stand at Saber River"" in a review for ""Crossfire Trail"" The two movies seem to belong to each other.Good plot, good casting, good acting. If you enjoy Westerns, you will find these movies satisfying."
4,A FINE WESTERN WITH TOM SELLECK.,"Though the western has all but disappeared from the cinemas these days, the genre is by no means dead. Instead, it has moved to the realm of the small screen. ""Last Stand at Saver River"" is just one example of the many westerns that have come on TV since the late 1970s. Featuring Tom Selleck as an ex-Confederate returning home, this is a fine film that deals with the effects of war on both a person and their family. While not one of the greatest efforts from TNT, the sometimes weak storyline gets elevated through terrific performances, including one of Selleck's greatest, and great gunfights and action sequences. Fans of the western genre will surely enjoy ""Last Stand as Saber River.""Movie/DVD Grade: B+"
5,Last Stand At Saber River (1997),"Great Movie, great price, great time on arrivel, will buy again from great vendor.Thank-you very much.JM"
5,I was in the mood for a GOOD western...,This fit the bill. The action and acting are both very good. A good watch for both my wife and myself. Almost as good as 'Quigley Down Under'.
5,Good western,"Tom Selleck is excellent in all of his movies, but his westerns are my favorites.This movie is somewhat out of the ordinary, but true to the form. Like QuigleyDown Under, this movie is a keeper."
4,Selleck Style,"Last Stand At Saber River is a good, old fashioned western movie. It tells of the plight of a family trying to reunite after their separation during the Civil War. Tom Selleck , in his typical calm , rugged style, intends to keep his homestead and raise his family while learning about the troubles his wife faced during his absences. Outside forces want to run him off his land but he won't be moved.Enjoyed it thoroughly. Carradine brothers lend awesome support."
5,Heike-ryu JiuJitsu,"Even thought the venue is out of date, the techniques and the presentations are excellent. Mr. Tamura demonstrates completely each move to make your self defense work! It is a great loss that these videos are out of print and the dvds don't seem to be available any more. Many folks have tried to copy the contents and even the title of these videos."
3,Too small for a rabbit,"I have a netherland dwarf rabbit and she's quite tiny for a rabbit and the cage is still very small. If you put nothing in the cage then it would be fine. But I have a litter box and an igloo (bunnies NEED someplace to hide/be high up or they will be very unhappy) and there's BARELY space for her to stretch out fully. Since she is litter trained and spends a lot of the day running around it's OK, but if you're someone who leaves the bunny in the cage all the time, then this is not a good cage. If you have anything larger than a netherland dwarf you must get something bigger. It gets three stars for being easy to clean, the top just pops off with minimal effort. It's still sturdy enough to carry though without worry of the base falling off."
1,Should NOT be for guinea pigs!! :(,"This cage is waaaaaaay too small! My cage is literally 18 times the size of this cage, and technically my cage is a little smaller than recommended. But putting a guinea pig let alone two guinea pigs in this cage is abuse!"
3,too small,"I bought this cage in a store, and it's too small for my adult rabbit plus her litterbox, toys, and water bottle. If you've got a big bunny, don't make my rookie mistake - save your money for a bigger cage.It's a fairly good cage otherwise. Two latches won't stay latched, but there are four others that secure the top to the bottom anyway. Bunny managed to pop open the front door once, and since then we've reinforced it with velcro strips. I'd imagine it would be perfect for a guinea pig or two."
1,Too small for a rabbit,"This ""starter cage"" is all wrong for a pet rabbit. Firstly, it is WAY too small for any rabbit to live comfortably in. Don't waste your money on this. Buy an X-Pen (dog exercise pen-see below) instead and you'll have a happy rabbit. Bunnies shouldn't be cooped up in tiny cages with wire bottoms anyway. Bad for bunny and bunny's feet.Midwest Gold- Zinc Indoor/Outdoor Exercise Pet Pen, 24W x 24H"
1,No,"This cage is way too small for a guinea pig. If you have a baby pig, then it could live in the cage for a few months, but no adult guinea pig should be in this cage.The food bowl is crap- guinea pigs will just tip it over. You never need a ceramic bowl that has some weight to it.The bedding they give you is also bad- it sticks to guinea pigs, and puts out a lot of dust (which is very bad for guinea pigs!)."
2,Good but Disappointed all at the same time,"I was soo excited to receive my cage set up in the mail however imagine my suprise to find there was no pet with it. After crying my eyes out for about 10 minutes thinking he had gotten loose from the box and cage, my friend and I trapped a squirrel from the yard and now peanut is my new pet."
1,Plastic crates or cages NOT good for house rabbits.,A plastic cage is NOT the place for a House Rabbit. They can chew through the plastic.Their diets should be at least 60% Timothy Hay then greens. There is so much more to a delicate rabbit's digestive system & eating their way through a plastic cage is not a good start.
4,Decent home for guinea pigs,"Decent home for guinea pigs...one pet, two at most...water bottle included not top grade--I replaced it immediately with quality bottle...check freshness of food included...Amazon's price $20 to $40 less than at pet stores for same product..."
2,TOO SMALL,"I have a 5 pound dutch bunny. I bought this cage because the worker at the pet store assured me it was plenty big enough for him. I can't put anything in the cage other than his food dish and litter box, and he still barely has room. I can't put his large dome in there that I purchased him. There's just no room, and I feel bad for him. The cage was a waste of money."
2,OK for Temporary,"This kit is OK for a little while, if your a beginner at owning a guinea pig, but avoid the bedding, it isn't good. The food is ok temporarily, but Oxbow Cavy Cuisine is much better and healthier. The cage is too small for even ONE guinea pig! Generally, the cage size for ONE guinea pig is 30"" x 36"" (7.5 square feet the minimum, it is prefered by your piggies to be more though) this cage is 18"" x 30"" (less than 7.5 sq. ft). Some people, including myself, are putting 2 or more guinea pigs in these cages! Please, do your little piggy a favor and get them a BIG cage, where they have room to run around and popcorn, and to do anything they please. SuperPet, we love your products, but this is a disappointment."
2,"Dangerous bedding, missing parts and some parts not to scale","1) Do not use the pine bedding that comes with this cage!! When we picked up our hamster from the MSPCA, they said this kind of bedding causes respiratory problems in small animals.2) Our cage came with a water bottle, but no wire to attach it to the cage.3) The ""toy"" is not the right size for this cage. It is way too long and hangs down in the litter, which is not hygienic for the hamster.4) I know you want a secure latch, but OMG, this cage is so hard to open.I wish I did not buy this online so I could return it without eating the charges! We had to make several changes so it can be usable. We bought proper bedding, altered the toy so it could be hung properly, and made our own wire hanger for the bottle. I won't play with the latch though. Not worth losing our hamster over."
3,homster home,"i find that this cage doesnt stop lilly from getting out, i've tryed everything to keep her in it. the bars are spaced to big. this would be a great starter home if only it would keep her in there. she loves her wheel tho and never takes a brake good deal and an okay product."
3,It's fine.,"I decided I wanted a second rabbit to be friends with my current one so I thought it'd be best to get a 2nd cage in case they don't get along. I had a limited amount to spend on a cage, so I saw this ""complete kit"" for $45 and jumped at it. The cage is way smaller than my current rabbits cage. I own a netherland dwarf and I'm getting a holland lop and I assume they should have at least the same amount of cage space but unfortunately no. The kit came with food, bedding a broken toy (oh well) a water bottle, a dish and a treat. Fine, all as expected and I'm sure if each product was purchased individually it would come out to about $40 so they were a great value in my opinion. The cage itself was flawed. The metal parts that were supposed to link together to keep the cage up were too wide so the cage wouldn't stay secured so I had to use pliers to permanently secure the cage. Kinda mad about that. Overall, I am satisfied, not overwhelmed with joy, not surprised, just satisfied."
4,Great record from the Songs: Ohia persona,"If you thought that the music of Jason Molina's band Songs: Ohia couldn't get any more austere or harrowing, then check out this record. It is very spare and may not be for everyone, but if you love Molina's work with Songs: Ohia, then I highly recommend this record. ""Honey, Watch Your Ass"" and ""Long Desert Train"" are two of Molina's finest songs. The simplicity of these songs belies a sophisticated emotional depth that may not be readily apparent with the first listening. This is not Molina's best release, but it is certainly a significant record with several memorable songs."
3,good back up tube,i was surpriced to see a presta valve with no threads so i keep it on hand for those times i(or a friend ) quick need a tube.i'm proablely just old school but i just like the threaded type valves
1,Disintegrated?,"This product is HORRIBLE, it disintegrated into dust in my yard. It is thin and definately did not block any weeds. I recommend not purchasing this product."
2,"Ok, but I need something heavier","This fabric would probably be OK in a flat garden. I attempted to use is on a slope and it certainly isn't strong enough to hold any soil in. Additionally, when I happened to spray it with a jet of water it shredded."
1,Waste of time Do Not Buy it!!!!,I would have given it Zero Stars if I could... Weeds and grass just grow right through it. Do not waste your Money on this product!!!!!
1,Disappointing for garden cover in FL,This product does not work at all as a ground cover or weed buster at least here in Central FL. I laid this down in April 2012 as a ground cover for some plants in a raised 2 foot garden bed. The first week of May 2012 I noticed that the material was already degrading and tearing. We have had some rain and lots of sun and the material just does not hold up. The ground cover tears easily and seems to be decomposing. No way there would be 6 years out of it let alone a month.There are weeds growing under the ground cover pushing it up. The weeds are healthy and green. I don't think this ground cover lives up to the Dewitt brand. Very disappointed. If you are looking for something to degrade quickly as a ground cover this would be your product. Maybe for covering seedlings until they mature but not for a weed buster as advertised.I use Dewitt ground covers a lot with great success but this product is not one of their better products.
4,Does the Job,"Just roll it out.Pile on the landscaping gravel and say good bye to weeds.Nice quality stuff, does the trick.Shipped totally free by 2 day air to me since I am a Prime member."
2,Not for garden cover :o(,"While this item blocked weed growth, it is not very durable. We put the covering down on tilled garden soil 25' long by 2 widths wide on May 1st, and by May 14th, the material was as tissue paper. The slightest brush against it caused disintegration. We used bent wire stakes to hold down the material, which worked ok. It didn't lift in the wind. But after being on the ground for 10 days, we attempted to cut a small hole to plant a tomato plant and the material fell apart when touched, even where it was dry. This item may work well when covered with gravel or other material, but is not good for garden cover to prevent weeds. Next year I'll purchase a more durable garden cover. Not sure what I'm going to do with other 2 rolls of this stuff. Maybe I'll try to double it and see what happens. I really wanted this item to work. Too bad."
1,Very POOR product,I purchased this product for our garden to help with the weed control. After 2 weeks of being installed it started to fall apart. I have never seen a this type of product fall apart like this. I have used other products of this type before and never had this problem.
3,Good Game,"Decent game, though not a lot of replay value. You get a choice 500cc, 600cc and 700cc Yamaha snowmobiles, but only 500cc to start off. You have to get 1st place on all tracks in the 500cc races to move up to 600cc snowmobiles and the same for 700cc. Overall fun game, but even when you win your races and get prize money to upgrade your snowmobile, the computer seems to upgrade theirs also....so you never really get an advantage. Good game for the ten bucks, but don't pay more."
4,Hours of relaxing fun.,"I'm an adult who likes to color while my husband is watching something I don't particularly care to watch on television. The discovery of this and similar books on Amazon has saved me from spending many a frustrated night watching ""reality"" TV. I like to copy the page I'm going to color so that I can use card stock when I want to use ink or markers and paper for colored pencils. Plus the added benefit of being able to color them again with a whole new color scheme. The geometrics also allow for choosing different areas to group together to totally change the way a picture looks every time you use it. Wonderful!I definitely recommend."
1,Pass on this puppy,"Received this collection as a gift from a friend. To say the least it was disappointing. The authors are so self centered they focus less on the food and more on their assets. The recipes are ok, if you can find the ingredients. Naturally there will be a few missing as well as I found. I was a bit surprised the James Beard group would consider this one, but the pictures are nice -- just don't try to cook from it."
2,Satanisn & bondage,I live in Price County and there is a lot of missing children.I read the horrifying story of John Weber. I think a lot is missing like details of the Lenz family. I also believe that there were more people involved with Satanism. I don't understand how Emily could be beaten that bad and cut up and the assailant John Weber had no scratches. I do not understand why one person is at fault and the others get away free. I believe Satanism should be exposed to the public for what it is so that people can protect their children from this evil. There have been other cases that involve Satanism that are covered-up.
4,Sad but true...,"After knowing something about some of the people in this book I think there is a lot missing. There should be more information on the Lenz's, especially Emily and her mother? Were they completely Innocent in this case or was John pushed over the edge? [Not that any one deserved to be tortured or killed]"
2,A Fast Paced Story,"The story moves right along, with many interesting facts about nuclear subs as the mystery unfolds. Believable characters although the sometimes arrogance of the main character is somewhat over the top. The book is flawed because of the many typos and one wonders why the editor failed to correct them."
2,Interesting Story Marred by Factual Error,"The author, a United States Navy Lieutenant Commander, writes an action packed novel, yet begins it with a glaring factual error. On page 8 of the book, the developer of the United States nuclear submarine program is identified as HIRAM Rickover. Students of naval history will immediately know that Admiral HYMAN G. Rickover is the person whom the author is attempting to identify. Are other facts equally flawed? The book is a good read, but probably should be taken with a grain of salt."
1,a xero copy,"I am completely dissatisfied with this book ""Miniature Schnauzer Champions 1952-1987"". I expected to get a book and not a xero copy. I expected to get colour pictures and pedigrees. There are very few pictures - all black&white of poor quality. There are some pages missing in this xero copy. This xero copy doesn`t fulfil my expectations in any means."
3,"Slovene, English-Slovene/Slovene-English Modern Dictionary","Das'a Komac provides a very minimal language dictionary that contains a pronunciation guide and a phrasebook. Among the 36 thousand entries, very few usage examples are included, and multiple meanings of the same word are not contrasted. The book is useful, yet consumes large amounts of time to make small translations, and it takes alot of practice to become accoustomed to the setup."
1,"Slovene, EnglishSlovene/Slovene-English Modern Dictionary","I was quite disappointed with this book. Being unfamiliar with the Slovenian dialect, I wanted a book to use for translation while doing genealogy research. I had some short letters and notes in Slovenian which I wanted to interpret. I was not able to translate many of the words using this dictionary. To put it bluntly, this book was totally useless."
5,Rare Footage,"This is the best video I've found dealing with the early '80's NYC club scene. Sure, its a little rough in places, but to get all of these bands (mostly before they were famous) is really a find. For anyone interested in New Wave and its origins, this DVD will be a great addition to any collection. Hope they come out with more."
2,Like Sturgiss?,"I'll never get to Sturgiss. I ordered this DVD so I can see what I'm missing and it looks like an absolutely awesome party. Bike rallies are the best and the number of bikers and bikes that attend Sturgiss is frightening.The DVD quality is good and the sound fine. Theres something for veryone, cool bikes, cool babes and grizzly old bikers. I enjoyed the interviews they had with rally goers. Some old geysers that have played a role in getting Sturgiss to what it is today and whom seems to be quite famous leaves me cold but others might enjoy it.Extra features includes pics of tattoos which I haven't managed to sit though yet (it's boring) and some bike pics from Harleys and Boss bikes which isn't on my DVD for some reason (edition?) but it's not missed.Theres some unexpected (not unwelcome) nudity - be warned - but if you've been to rallies this wouldn't bother you."
2,Not very good at all,"My main problem with the book was that there just wasn't much to it, both in terms of the writing (very wishy-washy) to the ideas. The author descibes 4 paths but does not do a good job of telling a person how to incorporate the concepts into daily life. Some other reviewers had much that was positive to say but I would argue that this book was like a cheerleading manual than a thoughtful guide."
4,The Four Fold Way,"Book arrived on time and in good shape. I really know nothing about the book itself. It was a gift, therecipient seemed pleased."
4,Four-fold Way,I like the book better than the CDs. There is a nice breakdown of information and a simple to understand text.
1,Extreme Sports Bloopers - Sports Gone Wrong,"Not very funny. No narration, not much in Major sports. NOT WORTH THE MONEY"
2,"ah, so boring","this dvd looks like it was put together by 1 amature in the basement. not exciting at all, little clips of skateboard, rollerblade, snowboarding just thrown on a dvd with little effort. what do you expect for this price. you can see better action on ESPN."
3,Early Taylor Mason,"Taylor Mason is a very F U N N Y comedian. This is when he was just getting started so you will find this is funny, buy, he has gotten funnier. He's a riot!"
5,Track Listing,Songs are: 1. Just Another Lover 2. Can't Get Enough 3. Anything Worth Having (Is Worth Waiting For) 4. Lady In The Shadow 5. Bring Your Love Around 6. Cover Girl 7. All Night 8. Penthouse Lover.
4,Anno's Counting House,This book is out of print. The copy I received was exactly as described and very satisfactory. It arrived in the expected time in good condition.
3,capturing and killing beauty,"A nice pair of close-up binoculars, a flashlight and boots could be a lot more exciting and respectful of these animals than drying them up just to copy their evolutionary path and call it art. The three stars are for the benefit of those who would have never known such creatures exist, that much this book has done. Why not get a microscope and take photos of bacteria, or take photos of metal detector screens. I prefer my animals alive in their habitat, and my art to really say something. Check out naturephotographers dot net. Now there is photography of nature."
4,"Excellent, as expected.","I like the set, for being the typical excellent quality from pyrex, but the millions of warnings it comes with are making me nervous. It hasn't given me problems with anything though. I can take it from the oven to the table to the fridge to the freezer, and back, with no problems."
1,Consumers be warned!!,"I've used pyrex for years with no problem, but last week while baking a casserole (with no sudden temperature changes or other misuse) my pyrex dish shattered into a million glass shards. A friend of mine had told me about a similar experience, but I had assumed that hers must have been a different brand. It turns out this has happened to LOTS of other people with pyrex - check out [...]. Statistically, your chances of it happening to you are probably low, but if it does happen the danger is very real. Sorry, but I'm getting rid of all my pyrex and recommending that others do likewise."
4,feet stay dry but...,"I like how your feet feel even if worn for an entire day, But they seem like they could potentially lose their snug fit over time. And they are very expensive."
2,Comfortable but not functional,These socks are extremely comfortable. The bottom of the sock is like walking on a plush carpet and has very long fibers. Unfortunately this means that they hold in moisture very badly. The bottoms are too thick and the tops are too thin.
3,Good socks,The sock is good quality but a little too thick for me. I would recommended for colder climate areas of the country.
2,Really disappointed,"As soon as I put these on they felt rough on the bottom of my feet. When running my feet got very warm and sweaty almost immediately. For $14/pair I will go back to my old plain cotton socks which feel and fit beautiful and cost around 98cents a pair. :( I only read positive reviews about these socks wherever I go but I guess they just don't like my feet. I was very disappointed. Yes, I washed 1 pair and had the same problem."
3,"Ok, not great for me","I have used these socks due to the glowing reviews. Unfortunately, I do not find them as perfect as others. The padding is somewhat bulky and in the shoes I use for running, they make the shoe somewhat snug.I have used Balega with great success.I do run 4-5 miles daily. For me, the wear is OK and the socks, fit, just not a fan."
1,Terrible and Terribly Misrepresented.,I've had all the toes amputated on my left foot and the two largest toes on my right foot. As a result my feet have spread and I need an Extra Large Sock to cover them. I purchased one pair of these because they are advertised as XL/14 but I couldn't even pull them over my heel. They were terrible!
5,absolutely perfect for me,"Great socks for sports and every-day use"". I have owned several pairs of these for several years and they are comfortable as well as they outlast anything else in my drawers. Great product, great value. And great for running...no blisters no more! These mini-crew a little bit over the ankle and thus higher than the ""micro"" ones, which are ""no show"".I would alwways prefer these socks before others, and I have tried so many..."
5,thorlo sock,"These are the very best socks out there for running,walking, no blisters,keeps you dry in all weather conditions. be sure to get proper sizing so its a good fit they do shrink a tad in the wash."
4,I Think These Will Work,"I did not buy these for running - I bought them for my hot feet that I am on all day at the hospital where I work. My feet get very hot but I need the padding. these have nice padding on the bottoms but the tops are thin and cool, so I think they will work out nicely. Still.....at this price I will have to really take good care of them."
1,First Richard Jury novel,"I am searching for a new author to read, so I picked up this Martha Grimes - therefore it is my first Richard Jury novel. I found it very difficult to follow all of the different characters and keep them straight. I also thought it took until about page 186 to get to the whole story - ugh, it was a bit frustrating. This is not a book I would recommend to people. I am wondering if I need to start at the beginning of the Richard Jury novels to enjoy her writing..."
3,"Not terrible, but not very natural","Grimes is a talented mystery writer, who rarely fails to entertain. While not laugh-out-loud funny, reading one of her books generally inspires a chuckle or two. _Five Bells and Bladebone_ is no exception-- the book is well-written, and the characters of Long Piddleton continue to entertain.The major problem with the book is the resolution. It's as though Grimes got an idea into her head about the clear-cut nature of murder and wanted to see it through even if it did violence to the characters as she'd already established them. I was very unhappy with the ending of the book-- I found it contrived and at least a little bit silly. Mysteries are better off character-driven rather than being pushed by Ideas of the writer."
1,The most confusing of all M. Grimes books.,I am an avid M. Grimes reader but The Five Bells and Bladebone has me stumped. I cannot figure out who was who as far as the murderer and the two women are concerned. Very unclear ending for readers.
4,Best of the Lot,"I thought this was the best of the Martha Grimes novels that I have read. I loved Tommy Diver, he was a great kid. Its got some coziness, some interesting settings, interesting characters, and a great plot. I, by the way, liked the ending, it made sense to me. One can commit an unprosecutable crime but then not be prepared to live with it."
5,A murder victim who gets his due,"Another addition to this wonderful series. I love the humor, and Melrose is my favorite character. And I look forward to more from that cheeky cat Cyril. This story took a turn I didn't expect. I became intrigued with the character, Tommy Diver, and am wondering if there will be more to follow about his role in the lives of this little English village and nearby. The author doesn't forget previous characters, even ones who met unfortunate ends. The adulterous murder victim in this book was indeed the villain. I think what I enjoy most about these stories is how the author treats our emotions when we encounter the disappointments that often come with our human encounters."
4,Sabas11,"My granddaughter was not only delighted to receive a book in her name, but she also found the story quite interesting. Now that she's a first-grader and on a higher reading level, she's really enjoying all the books I ordered that contain her name. Needless to say that I'm delighted as well!"
5,SILENT CRIES FROM THE GHETTO,"POSSIBLY THE SICCEST FRISCO COMPILATION-THIS ALBUM DELIVERS STR8 415 HEAT FOR THA'95 THANKS 2 PRODUCTION SKILLZ OF LES G & FLOWZ SPIT BY DEVIOUS,SAN QUINN,BIG MACK,TAY DA TAY,GUCE,YOUNG ED & MORE...DONT SLEEP"
4,Mystery & mysticism,"Lillian gives us another set of interesting characters mixed with mystery, British countryside, history, and mysticism! An enjoyable light read."
5,fence charger,This fence charger is top quality. It does a good job in keeping the cows in. I like the fact that it has a display that is easy to read and tells you when it is grounded out.
1,NOT for outside use,"This is for indoor use only.I didn't read the label on the unit that states indoor use only. Today it rained, and destroyed the charger.We replaced it with a Zarebra charger.I liked this charger, but what use is a charger for charging 100 miles of fence if it has to be indoors? Crazy."
4,US Navy Carriers,"This DVD contains extensive information on US navy aircraft carriers, from the early versions to modern supercarriers."
5,Greek cuisine,"There are a fair number of Greek cookbooks which repeat the same ""tired"" versions of Greek dishes. This book shows that the chef is truly a chef. He does not limit himself to past versions. I liked his ideas and they also taste very good. His creatvity comes through and should be applauded. Too often, I have heard complaints when a chef makes changes or comes up with new intepretations that ""This is not Greek food."" Well, yes it is and it is excellent."
3,Greek Cooking,"This is a cook book for beginners, who need to know the basicGreek kitchen. I preferred ""Real Greek Food"" by Theodore Kyriakou & Charles Campion.It was more original.Real Greek Food"
4,Great Release,"This is good stuff. Any Earl is great in my opinion. My only complaint is it sounds a bit dated. It has that early 80's overproduced country sound that I sometimes have a hard time enjoying, but overall it is still a fine release."
3,MONKEY PUNCHING,"THIS IS BASICALLY A CONTINUATION OF WRESTLEROTICA.WHEN YOURBORED AND YOU WANT TO PUNCH THE MONKEY, WATCH THIS DVD.IT WILL DEFINATELY HELP YOU GET THE JOB DONE. TAMMY SYTCH ANDMISSY HYATT ARE TOTALLY NUDE AND DONT LOOK TOO BAD.GRAB THEJOY JELLY AND ENJOY"
3,mammoth a miss - attached cart a big hit,"I like the mammoth but it's not a favorite of my two sons. They much prefer to play with the dinosaurs. The attached cart is a big hit and they contantsly drag that around so I'm not sure if it turned out to be such a bargain for me. I'm hoping it will become a favored toy and keep putting it out there but it usually sits on the sidelines. It just can't compete with the Mega t-Rex, Allosaurus, and all the other Imaginext dinosaurs. My only complaint is that this prehistoric animal comes with a patch of wooly hair, which is great for authencity but not so great for keeping it clean and hygenic."
4,My 2yr old really likes it!,"My 2yr old got this one and another Imaginext Dinosaur for Christmas and this one is by far his favorite. He loves attaching the cart to the Mammoth and moving them around.The reason why I give 4 stars instead of 5 is because the button to push down on to make the noise is not real easy. When you think it's pushed down all the way, you have to push a little harder to get it to make noise. Also, like the last reviewer I think the wooly hair is going to attract dirt and not stay very clean. But overall the toy is fun and very durable."
5,Excellent example of an FF book,"This was the first FF book I bought and out of the roughly 20 FF books I own I'd rank this as number 3 (right after Moonrunner & Deathtrap Dungeon).In this adventure, you're the last survivor of a pirate attack. Instead of outright killing you they decide to have a little fun and make you walk the plank. Luckily you end up in the middle of an ancient circle of magic that grants you gills. You have 24 hours to put together enough weapons and allies in order to get your revenge on the pirates that slaughtered your crew.It's an excellent adventure that makes good use of its undersea location."
1,Nice but not worth it,"A bit too pricey for what you get...just another version of Dog Fancy in terms of articles, photos etc."
3,Good for the Price.,"This excercize peddler is good for the price. However, it is a little tall at the peddles and so if you don't have a pretty errect chair or if you have a big belly you may have some issues using the machine. Having said this it seems sturdy enough for the average user and it does what it advertises. I bought it for my resistance chair and can see myself getting a lot of use on it on my chair in front of the TV."
2,melted? why?,"It worked great at first, I cranked the resistance all the way up to get maxiumum workout benefits. After only a week and a half I noticed it getting shaky and upon closer inspection found the small tube that holds the pedals had ripped from the platform. Now I know it had gotten extremely hot, I even put a small wet paper tissue on the pedal handle after pedaling and heard it sizzle, but to melt and break? Just from pedaling? It never left the underside of my desk and I never stood or dropped it or anything of that sort. Would been great if it didn't break... Not sturdy... Not recommended... All I did was pedal... Now if I pedal anymore, the upper half will separate from the lower half. Guess I'll fire up that soldering iron..."
3,Over-priced,"Cons-No ability to change resistance. However,the longer you pedal it seems like the resistance builds.-The pedals are not securely connected to the base.-After 30 minutes of use there is a rough vibration when pedaling on one side.Pros-Set low to the ground, it should be able to fit under most desks. My desk used to be adjustable and broke on the lowest setting so I have to set the exerciser off to the side and pedal at an angle to my desk.-The anti-slip grips work well on tile.-If you don't want to use the foot straps you can flip the pedal upside down. The straps do not drag on the ground.Overall I think that this product is worth $20, and not a cent more."
3,Pedal Exerciser,Works pretty well. Would recommend it to anyone who can't do more strenuous exercise.It is specifically designed for those of us who are very limited.
3,It's OK,I've had it for months and used it about 3 times. It sits in my living room and I forget it is there. I have short legs so I have to slouch way down on the chair or couch in order to reach it.
5,Pedal,I brought the isokinetics pedals for my 84 year old parents. Med A Care discontinue the Therapist who can into their home once a month. This is the same name brand Med A Care uses. They both enjoy the pedal because they can use it for their lower and upper bodies. It really helps with their bones. So now they have their own.
3,"So far, it matches what we paid for it.",It only works well at almost zero resistance. Less than that and the pedals wobble. More resistance than that and its resistance is jerky. It does well in providing a zero resistance motion to keep joints flexible.
4,Good,Its a great product that i just keep by my computer and whip it out whenever.....its easy and does give tension and the grip at the feet help hold in place perfectly. I only wish it gave more tension options...but i get what I paid for.
2,"Pedal Exercisers are a good concept, Pick another model/brand.","In short the quality is poor. As others have mentions the rotation is not smooth. Also the resistance knob does not provide enough resistance to be a real feature. The temperature of the metal parts becomes too hot, even after a short use, to be safe and can easily cause burns to the unsuspecting user. Also, possibly caused from the excessive heat, this pedal exerciser tends to fall apart.I love the concept of pedal excercisers but if you plan on buying one for yourself or as a gift I strongly recommend a different brand and/or model."
2,Get what you pay for,This item is not meant for anyone who wants to do more than a very slow steady pace for a short period of time. I bought it for my father after he had knee replacement surgery. It lasted a month. It would become too hot to pick up and move after using it (we are only talking 20 minutes).
4,"Works good, but squeeks.","I really enjoy using the pedal exerciser, especially with the weather getting cold, I do not have to go outside as often to walk. The only problem is that it squeeks alot."
3,Pedal Exerciser,One of the foot straps broke after about the fifth time of using it but it is still functional. The only thing I am really not crazy about is the way the base heats up when you use it. Stay away from it and you have no problems. I still use it when I am sitting down for a bit. It works well enough and is very sturdy.
1,flimsy,"strap broke on second use. not a good product. it may be inexpensive, but don't waste your money. it's flimsy."
3,its better then nothing,"Not smooth at all, but for this money what can one expect?It is okay! I did use one before, so I knew what I was gettingJ.E."
1,Be very careful,"The product is a **real** problem. The cycling motion is not very smooth, but more troubling is that when I picked it up after cycling for 10 minutes I burned my hand. ***Do not*** use this around young children. Not appropriate for older seniors who would have to move it right away so they don't trip on it!"
1,Not good quality,"After only used less than 5 times, one of the little knobs that hold the peddle strip broke off. Terrible. $30 gone."
4,Help elders to strengthen leg,"Bought this for an elder (mid-80s) who has blood circulation issue through the legs. Should be useful to keep the blood flowing while sitting down and watching TV, which is majority of the time during the day. The tension default setting is at the lightest which is good for the elder. So far with few days of use, it's promising as there is visible strength from the legs."
4,Mother loves it,I purchased this for my Mother ( 88 yrs young) and she simply loves it. She can feel a big difference in her calfs. She feels they are getting stronger which helps when she has to go for a long walk. She exercises every day for about 20-30 minutes.
4,"A nice, inexpensive little exercise bike.","I am finding this exercise bike a good way to get in a little bit of easy exercise. I have a chronic illness, and can't always get out to do other things. I used to work out all the time, and I miss it, so this little bike is a good addition for me. I have only used it for my legs so far, but plan to do arm exercises, too (need to set up a spot). It seems to be well built, and the price was excellent. The only thing that would make it better, is if the rubber ""feet"" had a little more weight in them. I have found that you need to have your body weight somewhat over the bike, and I think if it was weighted down it would be possible to recline more. Otherwise, a nice exerciser for the price."
3,Good but not great,"I bought this with hopes to use it at work under my desk while working. The machine definitely fits under the desk and I was hopeful. Maybe it's because my legs are fat, but my knees hit the underside of my desk when making a full rotation on the machine. There needs to be a way to adjust the height of the machine - six inches lower and I'd be good.Well made equipment - durable. It does not tighten tight enough to raise the tension enough for legs. For an arm workout it's good."
1,AWKWARD EXERCISER,"This is a very awkward piece of equipment. I bought it to use under my desk, and although it fits, I cannot sit upright and use it, I have to lean my upper body back. This makes it useless for my purpose, which was to peddle while studying and reading."
5,"So far, so good","I've not had this floor bike very long, but so far, I am quite happy with it. It is solidly built, quite stable and I love the tension screw to tighten it up over time. It's definitely worth the price and I am happy I bought it. Like almost everything I have ordered from Amazon, it was shipped immediately and arrived in less than a week. I love that kind of service."
3,Exerciser for home use,"This product is not what I expected. Even when tightened to full resistance, it does not provide enough resistance to do me much good."
3,"Solid product, not always easy to use","I work at a sedentary job, so I bought this to put under my desk to use during long periods when I cannot get up. I'm already an active person, so it's not really for fitness, but just to keep my legs moving during the day. It works well, but is practically impossible to use at a desk because you can't do it without hitting your knees. So basically, I'm getting a lot less use out of it than I would like. It's a nice product to use in front of the TV, but may not be the best option if you want to use it under your desk."
4,Food for the couch potato,"For anyone who has ever felt guilt about slouching before the TV set for four hours this is psycho therapy with a tad of actual physical work out.You might say derisively that you are ""just spinning your wheels"" and indeed you are BUT you can increase the tension and the time enough to actuaallt make yoiur thighs and calves burn.It may be no substitute for a five mile hike or an hour of jogging but it is much better than sloth.And the price at Amazon was unbeatable"
1,Zero Resistance,"The ""resistance"" knob does nothing - there is no resistance whatsoever.Although a good little machine - it's doing nothing for me at all without resistance!"
3,Works OK,"I didn't like the intense 'rubber' smell that lasted for weeks. If you try to use this while seated at a desk, that desk has to be really high to accommodate your knees as you pedal."
2,That's hot!?!,"I suppose I should have expected this as there is obiously no space for gears but I was still caught off guard when it burned me. The tension mechanism uses friction only to bring you to higher ""gears"". That friction then heats up not only the ""gear box"" but the entire length of the pedal arms as well. Thank goodness they made the pedals out of plastic cause that's the only part of the body that doesn't transfer heat. You can avoid the heat by never turning up the tension but then why buy a tensioning pedal? My advise is to spend the extra money for one that uses real mechanical gears cause this thing is useless."
1,cheap but still not worth it,"The product is built well, sturdy and so forth but just doesn't really do much for you because of the balance and inability to really stick in the ground as you pedal harder. Honestly you can get the same benefit by pedaling your feet in the air with shoes on to give some weight as you pedal. A nice try at a product but not close to successful for what it wants to accomplish."
4,It's Great !!,"The Isokinetics is great, it's small enough to take into other rooms. My husband uses it while sitting in his lounger and I use it while sitting at the computer."
2,you get what you pay for I guess,"I ordered this about two weeks ago and it worked pretty well at first. I could add resistance and pedal for a pretty good while. It would get very hot but I expected that. After consistently using it I noticed that I would start with the resistance up, and after two or three minutes of pedaling, the resistance would disappear and the thing would jump forward. I still would try to pedal at work under my desk, but first the right pedal fell off and now the other has too and I can put them back on but they wont stay. I'd try another brand."
2,Less than expected,"Two or three days after using this product the tension control had stopped applying tension despite screwing down the control tightly as if all the ""brake pad"" material inside had all worn away already....although it still functions and you can still get ""exercise"" from it you wont be able to get your heart rate up enough to get as much benefit as you would otherwise, after the tensioner stopped working I was not able to get my heart rate above 100bpm :(Then a few days later a retainer clip popped of while using, apparently without ill effect to operation, I later put the clip back on, and it has since stayed on.It started to squeak, I sprayed oil into it and it stopped..... so there it is, I have a free wheeling peddler, with no tension."
1,Pathetic,"I wasn't expecting much, just something to exercise my legs on without taking too much space in my little apartment. The tention does not go up NEARLY enough to make this useful at all, I might as well be peddling my legs the air! Just laughably bad, don't waste your time or money."
2,An in depth look at the isokinetic pedal exerciser.,"Meh.That's it. Meh.You get what you pay for, I shouldn't have expected more than I got. The shipping was a bit drastic, coming to almost the price of the pedals. So, I sort of paid twice for one product that is basically ""just"" $20.00 worth of product."
5,"Good product, high handling fee",I like the peddles good when your sitting at your desk at work lets you burn some calories or when your watching a long movie. It was high shipping and handling fees though I think I paid more for shipping and handling then for the product it self.
5,An excellent teacher resource,"Be Sealed is a comprehensive Confirmation program, very suitable for CCD classes. In 5 parts, the book looks at baptism, confirmation, and the associated Catholic teachings needed to prepare for this sacrament. The accompanying guide breaks things down for teachers, so that even new or inexperienced teachers can use the program effectively. I especially like the way it incorporates Christian witnesses like various saints to give kids an example to follow."
5,Very detailed...,"Few books for younger readers about the ice age get into so many details. Not only are there chapters about how ice age humans hunted and kept warm, but the book also examines why and how humans would need to keep track of time, what animals besides mammoths and other big game would have been on their menu and even a chapter exploring the many reasons they may have had to create art in the first place.Full of photos and drawings, a great book that asks a lot of questions and gives some possible answers."
5,Integral Reference for the Professional,"The book is frankly designed for the professional graphics artist, not necessarily the novice. I argue that 3DS MAX 7 is of more value to the professional but is not inaccessible. There is a cumulative effect to the presentation here, but the idea is that the professional designer will be seeking a concise reevaluation of his own skills in the medium he's working, in order to better determine how a project can proceed. This reevaluation is necessary for all artists, in all media, and a reference work such as this is a firm base from which to begin, again, if indeed you are struggling on an approach. Deconstruction provides clarity, and this book's collated information will give you that groundwork in order to maintain focus in your own work. Do not sleep on having it on your shelf."
3,NOT for children!,"All Vampire Savior and Darkstalkers figures should not be intended for kids! This character is a Succubi, and should be only for teenagers, or older!Overall, the paint quality is nice, but I would only display Lilith in a case, not on a bookshelf. It's really hard to keep the dust off."
1,Terrible,"This is by far the worst Korean/English or English/Korean dictionary I have ever used. There are gaping and inexplicable holes in coverage, the definitions are often imprecise, and it includes a number rather objectionable English words (darky?!). Avoid at all costs."
1,Sex mistaken for insight,"Here's a prime example of an author who should not confuse sex for insight. Just being graphic does not accord you the respect of, say, a Henry Miller or an Anais Nin. This was banal at best."
5,Dope,"My father recommended this album for any and all Stanley Clarke uber fans. Plus, the cover is sexy! Made the purchase for my guy and loved it."
5,A wonderful journey into what life was like way back when,"Fran's book is a wonderful, down-home recollection of what life was like growing up during the Depression. You will feel like you've been sitting on the front porch with her, listening to her stories. She depicts rural mountain life without sappiness or silliness... it's just a good read."
5,Such an inspiration! Great ideas!,"I have returned again and again to this book for new ideas. I feel I now have a new way of looking at decorating! Using eBay is such a great way to grab some bargains to get the look you're after! You'll be glad you have this book, it's fun to see how she did an entire house! Great detail shows how she did it step by step! You can plan your own house project or just get quick update ideas for a room. Enjoy!"
4,"Fun, functional and full of fabulous ideas and photos!","Barbara Guggenheim has taken a model home and filled it from top to bottom with furniture, accessories and bric-a-brac, every item found on eBay ... she's done the homework (and a lot of the handiwork!), now you can benefit from her research, expertise and terrific taste. Each room in the house has a different theme, and Decorating on eBay offers a slew of fabulous decorating ideas, how-to tips and a good primer on getting started on eBay.A perfect gift for anyone looking to put a distinctive, individual stamp on their home decorating plans, whatever your budget -- and it's full of stunning photos that bring all of Gugggenheim's ideas to vibrant full-color life."
2,Very elementary,"This book had such good reviews so as an ebay aficionado and interior decorating devotee, I felt that I had to have it. It would be a find for someone new to either but if you are an experienced ebayer and have done a reasonable amount of your own decorating, there's nothing new here. Talking about collections and carrying out a beach house theme is not revealing. So for those with experience, I'd suggest you pass..."
5,Best buy for the money.,"I bought this to knock the bark off of wood that I was going to turn and needed something for ruff work. This chisel is a great buy and real quality. I'm not doing cabinet work, but I could with this chisel."
2,Horrid,"The ending of the war was satisfactory. I didn't mind the sacrifice and the bringing up the whole question of yeerks and the morphing cube intrigued me. Some people think this book is depressing, but I think that Visser and Andalite Chronicles were more depressing, yet fun at the same time.However, many mini-plots were not tied up and the ending is so utterly horrid. It's a cliffhanger, but it's not even inspired by anything in the previous books. it's just utterly random and leaves way too much to the mind. Anything is possible, because we know nothing about the situation.I suggest that if you haven't read this don't and if you decide to read it, then only read until the conclusion of the war. This book does not compare at all to my favorites, Visser and Andalite Chronicles."
3,TOO MANY FREAKIN QUESTIONS!!!!!,"I've read many many many animorphs and then when I finally said, ""I'm going to read the last one"" i was really disapointed! There are way way too many questions. I thought that Rachel was the one to do it, but why didn't Jake send the disabled people to go with her? then the blade ship wouldn't have gotten away AND Rachel probably wouldn't have died! WHAT ARE CASSIE, TOBIAS, MARCO, AND RACHELS LASTR NAMES??!?!?!?!?!? UGH! AND WHERE DO THEY LIVE?!?!?! what happens with the blade ship???? why the hell did some dude name ronnie or somethin come over and steal cassie!!?? AX SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN CAPTURE!!! and by the way the animorphs didn't go ""Into the series fighting"". KA Applegate, your an outstanding writer but couldn't you be nicer to all of your supporting fans???? My advice for faithful animorph lovers is to deffinatly read this book but be ready to have millions of questions and to be pretty dispointed."
1,THIS WAS HORRIBLE!,"WHAT A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME! I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE ENDED THE SERIES LIKE SHE DID! RACHEL WAS MY FAVORITE CHARACTER, AND SHE WENT DOWN WITHOUT A FIGHT!!! I HATED THE WAY THE BOOK ENDED, JUST LEAVING YOU HANGING LIKE THAT. I HAVE SOLD ALL MY ANIMORPHS BOOKS, AND HAVE VOWED NEVER TO READ ANOTHER AFTER THE TERRIBLE ENDING TO THE AWESOME SERIES....."
1,Cheated,"I am an adult. As is my daugher. We each have been with the Animorphs from the beginning. As children's storytellers, we easily became hooked on this series. Long after the interest in the series subsided, we still read for ourselves. Truly it was a great ""ride"" ... however we both feel as if we have fallen off the cliff.I would like to see Animorphs revisited, if K.A. Applegate would please rediscover her enthusiam for this series."
5,The Best and Most Deppressing Book Yet,"The Animorphs have fought a seemingly endless battle, and here is the shocking,deppressing,wonderful,extrodinary ending to this series. Find out A)Who dies B)What happens to them afterwards C) Who gos where. And the sad part is...we don't get to know all the last names! Just kidding. The really sad part is the first 1-8 chapters and the last one. She seriuosly should write another book about what happens afterwards. Well I can't say anything else...don't wan't to spoil it!"
2,"this is about the movies, good story..but not the animorphs",I got this movie thinking oh my gosh it's really an animorphs movie.I had read all the books and loved them but when I got the movie it was totally different from the book.Almost everything was left out.for instance in the book when jake was turned into a controller the yeerk inside him turned into a tiger then his dog.in this he turned into a tiger and was caught by the other animorphs.also axe does many things that were not at all in the story and everything in the book did not happen at all.you can buy these but don't get your hopes up!!!!also they look nothing like they do in the cover and have completely different morphs
2,Hmmmm.. . . . .,"Well, I read this series since the begining and it was really just amazing. I kept the last book on my shelf for years before reading it. I know that alot of people have forgotton but animorphs lives on. Somehow they will always be a part of me. This series was the best ever. Better then Remnants or Harry Potter combined. I think about it every day. I think about what could have happened. Maybe somday, someone will give the book a better ending but until then Animoprhs lives on . . . Jake. . . Cassie. . . Tobias . . . Marco . . . Ax... and Rachel . . Rest In Piece. You will be awoken one day. . . . . ."
2,A real letdown for fans! A BIG DISSAPIONTMENT!,"KA, you can do better than this. To have Rachel taken out so easily was pointless. KA makes Marco seem like all he ever wanted to get was to be rich and famous and Cassie just drops everthing having to do with the animorphsonce it's<the war> is over. Jake just retreats into his mind and stays there. Also, Ax just deserts everyone! This book could have been carried on for at least acouple more chapters. Then we really could have put the animorph series to a close. < Instead of wondering wether they make it out alive from jake's suicidle plans > This book does not deserve to be counted as one of the seris, it was almost as bad as the 'AlterAnimorphs'! After seeing what KA has done with Animorphs and Everworld I am less likely to trust her with this new seris Remmenants. It seems like she just wanted to end the books. I was deeply dissapionted."
1,Big Stinky Waste,"Five years of reading and hoping, wincing at every bad turn they got and cheering when they win. For what? A big stinky waste of paper. Did K. A. Applegate even look at what she was writing? Does she glory in human misery? WHAT is with people raving about how wonderful this book is? I found myself let down by the lack of effort K.A. put into this book. For those who have already read this book, brush up on your Star Trek aliens, reread the end of the book and remember plagiarism is a crime! Everyone who hasn't, you know who dies, so pretend everyone was made heros and lived happily every after."
3,What happened to a promising writer,I started reading this series five years ago and have been a fan ever since. But to be honest with you I now feel like I have been cheated. She took a great series and ended it horribly.I can't agree with the cliffhanger and since I know she will never come back to it I feel like she just gave up on the series. She gives us this new thing at the end of the book and then all of a sudden it just ends.Thats not an ending that is just an open ended idea to start up a series again. I can never say that I will trust her in a series anymore after seeing what she has done with both the everworld and animorphs series.I have all of the books from the animorphs and everworld series and I hate to say it but I feel I got cheated. Please don't do this with you new series otherwise all the talent you have shown for these two series will be forgotten in my mind by the fact that the author has forgotten how to write an ending.
3,The Beginning,"Hmm, what can I say? It was pretty bad compared to regular Animorphs books. I understand why KA said that it's realistic and it portrays war as it really is (and it does), but war was NOT what the books were about from the beginning. A lot of the time the series was focused on very small-sized battles and human emotions. I'm sorry to say this about one of my favorite authors, but I think she wanted to end the series with a bang and make it something more than it was, so she stuck this whole war thing out from out of nowhere trying to make the series more mature and meaningful than what it was set out to be.The ending would have been fine for adults but for its targetted age group it was way too much. The author wanted controversy and shock, to leave the readers a huge surprise. Well, she succeeded, but I think someday, she'll want closure for her own series too...Elisa"
1,Huh?,"This is just weird. I have loved Animorphs but not this one. To many Questoins at the end. What about Chapman? The animorphs' last names? The Council of Thirteen? Crayak? Is Ax Alive? Do Jake, Marco, Tobias, Jeanne, and that andalite guy Survive? Does the World Survive this New Empire? Who is The One? Why does he turn into Ax? does he die? Was he the polar bear who killed Rachel. Also At the end it said K.A.A. Made 54 Regular books, 4 Chronicles and FIVE megamorphs. One more book to Come?"
1,The Beginning (Or is it the end?),"This si a pathetic book. I am a fan of all the other Animorphs books, but this is a cliffhanger, and what you do find out about the ending is pathetic. All the romances are killed off at some time or another. Most of the book just says what their life is like in the future (which is not in the least bit interesting because they don't even stay in contact with one another). Plus there is almost no action in it at all. So she basically took out a life or lives (I'm not going to ruin it for you, all the romance, all the action, and most of the dialouge. What's left is a bunch of nothing, stuffing-like, pitiful ending to a great series. It was a big disappointment."
3,A bit disappointing,"Though it let me down a little bit, this final book did answer a few questions Animorphs fans have. Only one last name is revealed and that is Jake's. The battle scenes in this book are so much different than in the others...and some of the characters aren't acting like themselves. There are some odd scenes and the conclusion of this book - of the entire series - leaves you hanging in the middle of a battle, then comes an apology note from the author about leaving us hanging and a note to read her new series. It's clear she just did that to get more people to read her other series. No, I wouldn't recommend buying it - but borrow it from a friend or the library and see how you like it because it is most surprising in many areas."
1,A Total Disappointment,"Fans expecting a conclusion to the Animorphs saga will be disappointed and annoyed by Applegate's cliff-hanger ending to the series.... Their is very little emotion or action in this book, which is especially disappointing for a series finale. All-in-all, this book is a total letdown. It is hardly worth even being part of the Animorphs series. It is definitly not worthy of being the endgame for the five year old series."
2,Broken ending...,"After reading the entire series as a kid, I hated this book.Not because it was poorly written or because of the cliffhanger ending, I thought that was one of the more slightly parts.No, I hated this book because after 64 books of getting attached to the main characters, 2/3 of this book is just dragging on unnecessarily and destroying the characters I grew to love.I think it would have been better to end at the scene on the pool ship, where they'd just won the war, but at a tremendous cost. It would have displayed the themes of the book just fine. What bugged me is how it dragged on and on for another 2/3 of the book with each of the characters becoming really broken people, then finally them all dieing (I assumed when I read it, at 12. 17 now). Even though it was supposed to illustrate a tragic ending to war to be realistic, I think it went overboard for a childrens book."
2,eh,"I wanted to like this book. However, this was definately not a good ending for the series. It ended with everything haging, which was really NOT COOL. The same thing happened with Everworld, and I hope to God KA doesn't do this with Remnants. What would have made a much better ending in my opinion would be to have the entire book be the last battle, and then just little snippets of what happened afterward. WHERE ARE THE PARENTS? The Animorphs spent so much time saving them, and they just dissapear! Everyone was out of character. Marco was about as shallow as you can get,, Tobias left the woman he has been searching for since birth, and Cassie and Jake broke up so she could be with some guy named Ronnie! As bad as that last one would be, what makes it even worse is that in 53 Jake said he was thinking about marrying Cassie, and they suddenly break up. Sorry to rant like this; it just makes me mad that such a great series has such a mediocre and implausible ending"
2,Betrayed,"I enjoyed the book. It was a decent ending, with plausible character developments. It was Applegate's pregorative to destroy the Jake-Cassie romance, and in war, it does not matter how brave you are, if you are cut down by 30 guns you will die. I had no problems with most of the book. Unfortunatly, then I read the ending. I was outraged. I am 17, and have been following this series since I was 12 years old and saw an interesting cover, of a girl changing into a cat, in a school book fair. Since then, I have faithfully bought the next book every month. Not actually concluding the series was a betrayal of myself and every other faithful Animorphs fan out there."
3,And to think I'm still crying over Rachel...,"...after three years. I`m not that emotional, but hey, she was my absolute favorite character. A little dramatic, I mean come on. Tobias flies away with the ashes? Yeah. And the ending. A cliffhanger. Again. EverWorld (which I read first), Animorphs, and now possibly Remnants? I HATE CLIFFHANGERS! The book is mostly Marco (whom I now hate for being less-than-concerned with Rachel and all. He used to be a decent character). Personally, this was the worst Animorphs book (not counting Cassie and the bull), but thankfully this is not a review of the entire seris, which would have at least gotten four stars.A disappointing ending."
2,Bring Rachel back!,"I have been reading Animorph books since I got hooked on the second one. Rachel and Tobias have always been my favorite characters. I do think Rachel should have died, and I think her death was done very well, but I also think she should be brought back. I mean, It's very possible. The Ellimist or Crayak, something, should bring her back. I wanted this series to have a happy ending, with all the Animorphs together. Rachel, Ax, Cassie, Jake, Tobias, and Marco. Plus, I there were some questions that really should have been answered. Even little stuff, like what are the others last names? This is more of a beginning than an ending, and K.A. needs to write a real ending. I myself am currently writing an ending onto the Beginning. Rachel will be back in mine. I really see why she had to die, but that doesn't have to mean she should stay dead."
2,The worst Book in the Series,Man I can't believe this book. KA Appelgate must have been drunk or something. It destroyed Chractors that I used to like. I did like that Jake and Cassie broke up. About bloody time. It started off good I guess but why did they let Visser One live. I hated that guy I wanted him to die. The trial scene was so stupid. I could not believe Tobias lived in the woods instead of with his mother. Instead of making a good battle ending for the plot she creats a new plot and doesn't even finish it. If you read all the books in order up to this point then this is a misserible excuse for an ending. I will never read one of KA Appergates books agian. Animorphs had so much potencial. So much.
2,Needs better conclusion!,"Animorphs #54 was a great book until the last chapter. I mean,I get what she said about war not always ending in a ""happily ever after"" thing but the cliffhanger was just too much! So all I'm saying is that KA should write a Megamorphs #5 and have it continue from the ending of book #54"
3,Good plot but went too fast,"The plot was good, even the cliffhanger. I don't mind it, I really don't. But the book simply goes too fast, leaping from one topic to another like a flea, never truly going into the minds of the characters with enough detail. For example, did Rachel feel any guilt whatsoever when she killed Tom? I would have liked a little more emotion. It also leaves too much out, like what happened to the auxillary animorphs. Did they all die or something? It would be nice to know what happened to them. It was a good plot, a good idea, but it would have been a lot better if it had slowed down, added a lot more character analysis, and explained things more clearly instead of leaving the readers to do a lot of guesswork. Still, readable and very sad to get to the end... but I would have liked it more if it had slowed down a lot."
3,"Half good book, half waste of my time","I read this book over a couple times. Basically, everybody dies except for Cassie. While this shows what happens in war, it still seemed that K.A. was desperate to kill the Animorphs off. We all knew Rachel would die, and because we knew, the book wasn't that interesting. 2 whole chapters were wasted talking about Marco and how 'happy' he was and how rich he was. THe only interesting stuff in those chapters were him talking about the Andalites, pretty much the only time he doesn't talk about himself.My suggestion: Read this book in a library."
4,Interesting PBS Fare -,"An easy tour of a number of unusual buildings across the U.S., including the world's largest catsup bottle (water tower), the National Fresh Water Fishing Hall of Fame (shaped like various fish), the Big duck on Long Island, and my favorite - an upside-down building in Florida. However, I would have preferred that it had shown the Wigwam Motel in Holbrook, AZ (more dramatic than the one depicted in Kentucky; also has cars from the era), and would liked it to also show 'Car Henge' in Nebraska (other roadside stuff)."
1,Not Recommended,"I was given this clock for Christmas and have had it now for about six weeks. I should have returned it. Here are its problems:1. It is bulkier than most travel clocks.2. The backlight level is VERY LOW so that it is difficult to see the time in a dark bedroom at night.3. The controls are tiny and on the back rather than the front of the clock. This makes it very difficult to set4. The ""Atomic Radio Control"" does not differentiate between time zones so that you have to switch the clock manually when you are traveling anyway. This voids the primary advertised benefit of the clock.5. After only six weeks of ownership, the clock started a hgih pitched tone and the display has become unreadable.BOTTOM LINE: Don't purchase this."
1,Hands down the worst published work I've ever read.,"I would give it zero stars, but it isn't an option.There are no words in the English language to describe how bad this 'novel' is. First of all it's a novella, not a novel. But that's OK, because it could be 1000 pages long I still wouldn't have read more than 20 of them. The writer has no ability to form a coherent sentence. The words are cumbersome and have no flow at all. The stories written into dirty magazines are better. Teenagers can write better than this.Originally I bought this for my wife because I figured, she likes romance novels, she likes vampires, what could be better? Well, I could have bought her a copy of Penthouse that she would find more interesting. I can't possibly see how any woman could enjoy reading this. The sex is written in a juvenile and absurd manner. More like a farce of a romance novel, than an actual novel."
3,it's not all bad,"Fondly remembered (by us-Tyler and the boys probably don't remember it at all) for the wonderfully titled ""Jailbait"" (it is a great song) and ""Lightning Strikes"". The cover absolutely did inspire Spinal Tap."
2,Smoking remains,"Well, believe it or not, Aerosmith used to be a descent band in the early 70's. This album has still a little clue, of what's been going on in the past. But still it fails, offering you the wost side of Aero-style. There are only brief cuts form the huge jam they had going in the 70's. But still, it's a true masterpiece compared to the latest production. Jeess-uss..."
3,Different,"People love this album. I found the guitars well played but a little bitey. The songs weren't as melodic and they just didn't have the usual Aerosmith shake.Great seller though..,"
3,"Not Bad, But Far From Their Best","Gone are Whitford and Perry, in are Crespo and Dufay. This is not a bad album, but not really anything that stands out either. The songs are all ok, but much of it sounds haphazard and thrown together. ""Joanie's Butterfly"" is a bit different, but most of the album is kind of going through the numbers blues rock. Certainly not an essential album, but for fans of the band it is not a throwaway either."
4,"Even without Joe Perry, still a great album!","I think this album is very underrated. I'm a long time Aerosmith fan and JailBate and Lightning Strikes are 2 of my favorite songs. The album starts out strong. It rocks to the end. This entourage gets it done in the absence of Joe, though glad he came back!"
4,one of their most solid records,"O.K. so Joe Perry wasn't on this album; it's kind of like a Rolling Stones release without Keith Richards. But, if you're the kind of listener who can get past that, and maybe think of it in terms of a Steven Tyler solo album then you'll enjoy it. Certainly buy Toys in the Attic and Rocks first but if all you know is post Run DMC Aerosmith come revel in the dirty, drugged-out sleaze rock of Rock In A Hard Place."
3,GOOD START TO A COMEBACK,"When Aerosmith broke up with Joe Perry and Brad Whitford's departure, Steve Tyler, Joey Kramer, and Tom Hamilton hired Jimmy Crespo and Rick Duffay to fill in their shoes. They tried to regain popularity but to me didn't work. But Steve Tyler began to write great hits again. Tunes like ""Jailbait"", ""Cry Me A River"", and ""Rock In a Hard Place"" are samples of the reunion comeback."
2,"It Rocks, But What About the Songs?","This album is not terrible. It is simply so-so. It captures the darkest time in the history of the band. The members' drug problems were on their way to the pits. Joe Perry and Brad Whitford were doing their own things in solo projects. Aerosmith was left with not much of a songwriting team. they were forced to enlist Richie Supa as a regular songwriter and do whatever they could to get lyrics out of Steven. Thank god they got the real band back together and made solid records again. If this were their last, the band wouldn't have much of a history.Songs like ""Jailbait"" and ""Joanie's Butterfly"" are interesting but not good enough to be great. They only stand out cause there is not much else on the album.Strictly for the Aerosmith completist."
2,Aerosmith In An Eighties Place,"By the 80s Aerosmith had lost it. They had given up their trademark muscular hook driven hard rock in favor of screechen metal. Sad but true, hence, no hits, give this one a miss, even fans of the band will doubtless prefer TOYS IN THE ATTIC or GET YOUR WINGS."
2,The worst of the best,"I think this is the worst Aerosmith album, but ""worst"" doesn't mean bad. What i'm trying to say is this: It's not a bad album because there are good songs in it, but thinking about Aerosmith I feel that the tracks have less power that the others. Althoug Rick Dufay and Jimmy Crespo are good, the perfect (and unique) couple for ""A"" are Joe Perry and Brad Withford. I respect all the reviews by others fans because each one of us have our own mind."
2,Aerosmith in a hard place...,"Times were hard for Aerosmith. But what matter when you buy an album is if you like the songs or not. I don't care if the badn members wer overdosing, if the record company was putting pressure on them, if the members are gay...I just don't care.And, as for the music on the album, oh boy, Aerosmith had the talent to produce anything better than this [stuff], even without Perry and Whitford on board. Just it."
4,A very good effort!,"Most people out there I know dont even know this album exists and thats a real shame because it has some really good songs on it (I dont care that its not all the orignal members) buy it if you like Areosmiths sound in the 80s,this is a rock album not a pop album"
4,a great aerosmith album,Rock in a hard place is a very good album from the post joe perry and brad whitford era.this album contains like jailbreak lightning strikes push comes to shove and the classic title song.very highly recommended.
1,Aerosmith in its darkest hour,"Ignore all of the positive reviews for this album they are not the truth. If you are a fan of Aerosmith like I am, odds are you will not like this album. Only one song is good and that is Lightning Strikes. Jailbait is ok and is the only song from this album that they tend to put on best of compilations. The rest is a boring snooze fest that you don't want to hear. Even though Joe Perry & Brad Whitford aren't on this album, I don't think that is the problem. The state of the band at the time just didn't allow them to write good rock music. Luckily Aerosmith reunited and made a commercial comeback. If you are new to Aerosmith get Pump, Rocks, & Toys in the Attic. Those are the 3 essential Aerosmith albums. This album is for hardcore fans who want to be completeists. Don't expect to listen to it often and good luck enjoying it."
2,I've heard worst.,"I bought this cd with the attitude of being a completionist. There isn't anything terribly bad on the cd, however,it obviously is missing the Joe Perry sound. The fillin guitarists were more than capable in fact they were too good. Their playing was good and tight, but you can never seem to replace the initial body parts or heart and soul for that matter."
2,Aersomith turns to mush,"This may as well been a Steven Tyler solo album. Brad Whitford and Joe Perry were gone, and Tyler had to resort to a truly god-awful cover of ""Cry Me A River.""The only good song here is ""Lightning."" Get any other Cd than this...with the exception of ""Done With Mirrors,"" this is Aerosmith at its worst."
1,THE SADDEST DISSAPOINTMENT IN ROCK HISTORY,"THIS WAS ULTIMATELY THE WORST AEROSMITH ALBUM EVER RELEASED!! AND IT'S ONE OF THE WORST ROCK ALBUMS EVER RELEASED!!! NONE OF THE SONGS ARE GOOD AND THIS WAS MADE AT THE WORST TIME OF AEROSMITH'S CAREER. 2 OF THE ORIGINAL MEMBERS HAD LEFT THE BAND AND BY THE TIME THIS ALBUM CAME OUT, AEROSMITH HAD ALMOST BECOME FORGOTTEN. BUT, A FEW YEARS LATER THEY MADE A MIRACULOUS COMEBACK BY COLLABORATING WITH RUN-DMC FOR A REMAKE OF THEIR CLASSIC ''WALK THIS WAY''. DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM LIKE I DID. YOU'LL REGRET WASTING THE MONEY TO GET IT AFTER YOU LISTEN TO IT."
4,Good introduction to the subject,"If you are, like me, researching on rockabilly but did not know much about it to start with, then this is OK for you. I guess there's not much about its origins and the music that most influenced it (something I expected to find,) but that'a allright,mama. Pictures are very nice. The CD surely pumped up the rating I've given to this book: the music's great and quite varied so you have a whole overview of what it is about."
3,How to Master Simulaitons,"I did not find too many useful hints in this book. The information provided can be found in the NASBA website. However, some of the simulation questions were helpful. It was helpful because it provided a detailed explanation. The reason why I purchased the software was to get experience with the research portion of the exam. This CD does not have this option available."
3,Contains some good tips,"This book/software package has some good tips on writing and calculating. I would recommend if you need extra help for the simulations and never sat for the exam before. It gives some great Written Communication tips to maximize score. Definitely helps prepare.UPDATE...The CPA EXAM has changed in 2011. There are no longer written communications in FAR, AUD, and REG. Its all in BEC now. The simulations are much shorter and not as ""in depth"" as before. It is also in one Testlet rather than 2. This book is in the old format. I wouldn't recommend it anymore as ""helpful"""
3,Yoga as Excercise,"I had previously purchased a ballet workout DVD that Elise Gulan made. Very enjoyable and novel workout since I really haven't ever done ballet, except for a few months as a clumsy 5 year old kid. So I had high hopes for her yoga DVD.This DVD was just a workout. Not yoga. You might as well go lift weights or do pilates or some other workout. There was no mind-body stuff going on, no relaxation, no beautiful scenery. Just a workout. I probably wouldn't buy it if I had to do it over again."
1,Returned this DVD before I openeded,"Looked at what was on the back of the sleeve, and decided it was not the program practice that I was interested in.I didn't want to take the risk of unwrapping it, and then not liking it, as I would not be able to return it."
4,Pure Romance,"Sarah is unhappy with her life on earth. Men who want to marry and have children are in short supply. Sarah decides to move to the Outer Colonies where men want wives. On the way she is kidnapped and given a different choice. Marry the most hated man on earth, the ""Gaian Beast"".I loved the story of Garran and Sarah. He is kind and he spends the book proving he would make a good husband. This book is the perfect balance of Sci-Fi and Romance. Read it! You won't regret it."
4,Love with humour and tears.,I was surprised to find that I could not put this book down. I usually read paranormal set in present or past. This book is futuristic. A recommendation from Amazon and I am hooked. I read this novel first but it is the second of the series but can be a stand alone. A love story that made me laugh and cry. An original futuristic world created by Miller. I can't wait to read the rest of this series.
3,Average,"Not bad, but not too good either. Writing style was fine, it was more the content that I found irritating. But then maybe it's just me, I'm totally over the type of story where they meet their 'perfect mate'and there's minimal tension, and the man is practically emasculated because he can't ever 'desire anyone except his beloved'. Yeah, right. Oh, and sorry if that was a spoiler - again, not a bad story, just not to my taste."
5,..,"There is no doubt this is an amazing cd. But people need to understand that just cause you dont like the singers voice doesn't change if the band is good or not. Expand your mind capacity. If you're gonna rate this cd based on Tims voice theres no reason for you to be posting review. Bobby Burg, Nate Kinsella, and the amazing Sam Zurick, along with Tim, help make this cd unforgetable. The band experiments alot in this cd. Some songs on this cd like Fumio Nambata Had a Farm and Television Cemetery have to be some of my favorite songs from any of the past bands. I recommend this cd to any fan of Cap'n Jazz, Joan of Arc, ect."
2,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,This printer has given us a few months of work and then developed hardware issues. The maker finally replaced it with a new unit.
5,Excellent,"This software was immediately of more use to me after I got it than other CAD software I have had access to. Having 30000 hours of CAD experience on various systems, I find this is one of the best and most immediately instinctive suites to use. It particularly suits anyone with an inquisitive mind. The features match very well with software costing ten times as much, and not until you get into elevated price ranges where the monthly license fee is the same as the total cost of TurboCad do you get a clear difference in capability - and even then TurboCad can challenge. This is the most value for your money that you can hope to find. The company is not in receivership, although they have had troubles recently (which doesn't alter the quality of the product!)"
4,Design buff,"Just wanted you to know that I think I have the original Turbocad version. It is not compatible to windows, but it is great although limited. If the upgrades are any example of the quality of the one I use now, I will be very happy. I now have Auto Sketch and Bob Vila's home design loaded on my computer, and they all have some flaws, but I have been with turbocad for so long that I think I will stay with it and upgrade to the latest revision, so I can access it directly thru windows. I not only use it for home design, but also equipment design and other functions."
3,Excellent but out of date.,"I originally wrote,""IMSI is chapter 11, in a bad way. Their website no longer exists, this program is an orphan.""But IMSI has recovered from their problems and have released several new versions. Now the only reason not to buy this is that versions 7.0 and 8.0 are available. It really is an excellent program."
2,Poor shipping,"Al other items from Amazon has been great BUT this item, which was only 3 boxes of staples, was shipped as three loose ""heavy"" boxes within a larger box with no packing. They arrived beatup and two broken open and staple loose and broken from their strips. I got about a box and a half of usable staple fro three boxes."
3,good but no classic,"I had never heard of this album until i bought it. In the uk none of cher's material was released between 1974-1987 - unfortunately! However amongst cher's 70 treats and her diso period we also missed out on this album, maybe for the best? Its an OK album, although I do not think alot of time was spent on it to appeal to alot of people. There are some good songs including ""When the love is gone"", ""games"" and ""I paralyze"". Most of the album has cher type ballads, just not her best. This really was the very beginning of cher turning into a soft rock goddess, but this album seems more of a trial run that never got off the ground. It has grown on me but they arent her best."
3,NOT BAD FOR AN 80'S CHER CD,"Cher was not having that much commercial success in the early 80's when this came out. It should have done better than it did. The title song was written by Steve Kipner and produced by John Farrar. Cher must have been looking for some Oliva Newton John style success since that is the same team responsible for ""Physical"". ""Rudy"" is another winner as is ""The Book of Love"". Worth checking out."
2,This cd is not Cher's Best work,"Despite the title tracks great commercial grind,the rest of this cd is pure pop surface. Cher gives her all, but the center of the lp is not to be found.There are few tracks,and the rockish power ballad singing is hard and over emotive. Cher does this one better, with the 1995 cd(or is it 96),It's a Man's World.Blame it on producton, or Cher's lack of focus. The cover is post punk, but the cd is not.It is mediocre ."
2,Not essential,"With the exception of 2 songs, this album is an unfortunate note to Cher's triumphant musical resurgence in the 1980s. Surprisingly admired and re-issued, this album didn't sound better than it did in 1982. If you're an aspiring Cher fan, pick up her 1987 CHER disc instead."
5,Cher CD'S ROCK!,"The cd of I paralyze is the 2nd best in my opinion.. The current one ""Believe"" is awesome, but the ""I paralize"" hits second with me, as it's more of a happier tune to get into.. it puts a smile on my face! But so does all of Cher's Music! (huge cher fan here)"
4,An interesting album by Cher from the early eighties!,"Here on Cd is Cher's I Paralyze Album originally released on Columbia Label. It is an interesting album with the a great title song ""I paralyze"".. one of the best pop songs Cher ever recorded! The other songs are not as good.. but they are fun to listen .. a very interesting album from Cher when her recording career was going nowhere!"
4,Surprisingly good!,"Yes, it's an album from 1982, which is evidenced by the cover. But the packaging doesn't do the contents justice. This is one GOOD album!It's solid, early-'80s rock light years ahead of what was being played on the radio at that time. Why this album wasn't a hit is beyond me. From the opening of the girl group-esque single ""Rudy"" to the synth-pop of the title track, this CD delivers Cher in fine vocal form...and performing each song perfectly. My only regret with buying this CD is that I didn't buy it sooner! I am not a hard-core Cher fan, but this CD tempts me to become one."
1,don't waste your money,top didn't fit as advertised. The company thru up a ton of road blocks to get it returned. i ended up just keeping it and giving it to someone else.
5,BUSHED! Should be Widely Read,"Clemens's incisive evaluations of the president's statements and actions over a wide spectrum since 2001, graphically enlivened by Morin's editorial cartoons, tellingly exposes the emptiness of the 'compassionate conservative' mantra and the multiple failures of the administration's domestic and foreign policies. Bushed! pithily encapsulates the concerns of those disillusioned with the administration's foibles. From beginning to end, the book engages as well as disturbs and alarms the reader. It should be widely read. - Hermann Fr. Eilts, former U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia and Egypt, and Deputy Commandant, U.S. Army War College."
5,An absolute classic that you've never heard of...,"One of the best CD's I have ever owned. One of those 'Desert Island' CD's. You can listen to it all the way through 10 times without flinching. Brilliant (yet simple) breakbeats from DJ Seeq. No vocals, just an array of breaks that will keep you groovin all day and night. I can't say enough about this album. If you like breaks or downtempo you'll be stoked over this. Ages like fine wine- only gets better with time. The question I have is this- what ever happened to DJ Seeq? If anyone has info on this, or how to get Volume 2 of this series, please post it!"
4,What a delight to see this book still in print!,"I first read GOD AND MR GOMEZ as a child, in the Reader's Digest COndensed Books my parents ordered so faithfully. I was enchanted with the beauty of Baja, and the friendly, welcoming way Mr. Gomez encourages Jack to relax and become part of the culture he's living in. His house may not have been built quickly, but it will stand for a thousand years, thanks to Mr. Gomez:)"
4,Ballets Start Changing,"I have known this music from Arthur Bliss over many years but never been able to watch the ballet. Here at last was my opportunity. I was not disappointed. The story is the clash of powers in a chess game. Oddly there is no white side. The two antagonists are black and red, and the black queen reigns supreme.This is a rare example of the transition from classical choreography to modern dance forms. Written between the two World Wars it is a wonderful example of the choreographer continuing to widen dance forms.The VHS recording is somewhat old and nowhere near as sharp as DVD but the performances overcome that limitation."
4,In the middle of this book but wanted to review it so far,"I am in the middle of reading this book and find it to be enthralling with substantial facts about how poorly Pope Pius XII acted during this period. It is hard to believe anyone, especially a Pope, could be so cruel to his fellow man.A very good book to read but be prepared to be sad about its content."
5,Fair and thorough,"This book explains the response of the Catholic Church to the Nazi Government and the Holocaust. Coverage is given to time periods before, during, and after the Holocaust. Ample coverage is given to actions of the Church and individual Catholics that were praiseworthy and to actions or nonactions that were shameful. There was much of both.Unlike many other books and customer reviewers on this subject, the author appears not to have a particular bias that colors his analysis and assessment of every topic covered. The book is neither a blanket condemnation nor a blind hagiography. As such,I recommend it highly."
1,"The Catholic Church and the Holocaust, 1930-1965","The author clearly had an agenda with no regard for the truth and the body of evidence available. This is book is an example of very poor scholarship, a complete waste of my time."
2,Waaaay too easy,"I was really hoping this cardio workout would be higher impact, but it was really easy. I barely got out of breath. There are different sections and the two that used weights were a little more high impact, but still not challenging enough. I am underweight, but pretty weak and flabby, so I think this is too easy for beginners even. I do not see how anybody could really get in shape doing this."
3,Its okay,I like some of the exercise routines but not all. I haven't used the DVD as much as a result.
2,Ultimate Body,We expected a full work out with several targeted work outs. The targeted workouts are good but the full work out does not have a long or good enough stretching session to warm up your body. The back ground is lifeless and I would prefer to have individuals showing modifications on some of the exercises
2,could be better,I was working on a knife of mine and the tip of this torx driver just randomly snapped off and is still stuck in the screw. I had to use a rubber glove and pliers and another torx driver to complete the task.I guess it has a good grip but the tip is not made out of a strong metal so be careful not to break the tip off!
5,Excellent Resource for ELLs or Korean Language Learners,"The OPD is intended for Korean speaking English Language Learners (KLLs), but if can already read hangeul (the Korean alphabet), then it's an excellent resource for KLLs! I wish I would have had a copy when I was living in Korea!!! I know recommend it to all of my ELL students (when available in their language), and also use it to teach with in the classroom at times."
2,DOESN'T HAVE UPDATED KOREAN,"I ended up selling this cause the vocab that I learned from it is really old...I would use the vocab out of here with some of my Korean friends & they would always correct me saying, ""we don't say that"". I live about 30 mins from VA so I have a lot of friends to practice with. This book doesn't have some useful expressions but it's just out of date."
3,"Great concept, but could be better..","I loved the idea of pictures to help learning languages..However disappointed with the use of many words and chapters....I feel it should be more ""general"" and geared for my ""useful"" korean words.However, when learning Korean... the options are limited..."
5,Excellent condition and fast delivery,I'm very satisfied with the condition of the book and fast delivery. I would like to recommend this book to others.
1,one shoe contains scratch mark on it,"One of the shoes contains scratch mark on it. And to my surprise, most of the upper is made of man-made material with a little bit leather. But the instruction said the upper is made of leather. I'm very disappointed."
1,Terrible in the skies,"I would like to add that a lot of this footage repeats, and it is sometimes put together in nonsensical ways. For example, modern footage may be shown of a plane firing a missile and then it cuts to 1970's footage of a tank exploding. Don't buy this. Try the 'Challenge of Flight' DVDs."
2,scratched,non-repairable scratch on one of my favorits songs. bummmer. you can expect a thin scratch on used cds but this one was deep
2,I didn't particularly like it,The story was OK. I found the the characters rather unexciting. I think there was actually more passion between Arabella's mom and the doctor. It needed more heat!
4,4 only because the plot wasn't romantic,"First of all, I agree that rape really shouldn't enter the romance story world. You read a romance to get away from the grime of the real world and what happens? the heroine gets raped by the hero. That was my main irritation.Other than that, I was really annoyed at Justin's stubborn refusal to believe Arabella, and he never really apologizes for his callousness--he's too proud. That miffed me.But being miffed by a story isn't always bad. There was definitely passion in the characters and the story, and this being my first Catherin Coulter book, it urged me to read her other novels. Really, none have matched this one in the raw emotion and power, but that might just be first love/impression. If you can get past the hero and heroine as cousins (ick--they even look alike) and the other incest reference, as well as a thoroughly stuck-up array of characters, then I highly recommend this as a compelling read."
2,I was disappointed in the characters,"One of the things that I do not care for in Ms. Coulter's books is the way the men treat the women. I enjoyed her books for a number of years, but I have reached a point where I simply do not want to read anymore about men treating the women they are supposed to love as children - even taking on the responsibility for ""discipling"" them. I still enjoy Ms. Coulter's modern romance and romance/mysteries, but I am through with the historicals."
2,The Secondary Characters Are More Interesting...,"Sometimes Coulter wins and sometimes she misses. The H/H were not intersting to me. I was not rooting for them to be together. The heroine begins by being an a#% and then it becomes the hero's turn. The fact that the heroine idolized her jerk of a father made me hate her. And of course he comes out smelling like a rose in the end. I don't care what he did for his youngest daughter, but the way he treated his eldest daughter was unforgivable and made him a monster. That being said, I was more interested in Elspeth and Gervaise (It's really bad when you feel sorry for the villian) than the H/H. The fact that it got me to ""rant"" gave the book 2 stars."
1,UTTER TRASH,"Catherine Coulter was among one of the first romance authors that I ever read. I have liked many of her books, but I have noticed a trend in her historical romance that I can't like. The men always treat the women horribly. This book is probably one of the best or rather worst examples. The ""hero"" proceeds along his path with blind arrogance and belief in what he ""knows"" to be true. He brutally rapes his wife on their wedding night and then refuses to consider it rape. She acts like a spoiled brat practically from the first moment she appears, but you begin to feel a certain sympathy for her because of the unforgivable way her husband treats her.I'll continue to read Catherine Coulter's modern mysteries, but I doubt I can bring myself to read another one of her historical romances again. This is the worst one of all. Utter trash!"
2,Disappointing story,"I usually like Coulter's romances, but her books are either great or terrible. I have to say that this is the worst one I have ever read. The story line was completely obvious, with no suspense or mystery. The book had very little action but mostly lifeless, stilted dialogue. Very little romance at all, the main characters are uncompelling and its hard to see where the attraction is; the main love scene is a brutal rape. If you are a fan of Coulter I advise you to avoid this novel."
5,Best of,"Just bought this best of prelude vol 2. Absolutely sensational, electronic dance music at its very best. Honest, pure and powerful quality dance tracks. Although released at the beginning of the eighties all songs could easily become smash hits in nowadays' club scene."
4,prelude's dance,this is a good cd it has some songs i haven't heard in a while it really takes you back to the late seventies early eighties when your listening to it.
4,Was never the same after,"SO I'm not a professional reviewer and have only seen her once in concert, but live she is just so delicatly voiced and with almost child-like playfullness. Her album was only good for me bc I have heard her sing the sings directly and had some residual memory from that. I like her a lot, she attaches a lot more to me as a human being than just a singer songwriter. I found some of the later songs on the album to be tedious and dragging. My favorites are Cosmic and story telling girls, and she was absolutly adorable doing 1984. Orion was just devastating (in a good way) in person bc we were fortunate to hear her explaination. Very clever. I think at times her political writing becomes too over-bearing for me. I would Four star- the first half of the ablum absolutly. The second half, I'm still working on warming up to it. She has definitly effected me and I certianly wasn't the same after that show. Give her a shot, see for yourself."
5,Good tunes,"Anais Mitchell is one of my favorite finds in a while. She plays what I call `coffee house folk.' Which is to say it's urban, spare, personal, and often somewhat conversational. She has an interesting voice. It's not a perfect voice, but it has a tone to it I really love. The closest voice and style I could point to would be Edie Brickell. A friend saw her live and sold her praises to me. I tracked down a MP3 on her web site which led me to buy this CD (there is at least one earlier CD by her but I haven't heard it yet). Maybe Amazon will get some samples up one day. I give it my best recommendation. Anyone who likes good modern folk can safely stop here. If you are into more mainstream artist ask yourself if you like Jewel's earlier stuff. If so I think you will really like this CD. If you prefer more polished stuff... well this may not be it."
1,worst product ever,Installed in may 2011 went bad in feb 2012 less than a year of use and this part have to be replaced in my car. never going to get notting from dorman again
4,Comfortable!,"Pretty good quality for the money. I think it may run a bit on thesmall side, but there's plenty of flex in the fabric without beingtoo stretchy. Washes well, dries quickly."
4,Very Good,I enjoyed this book very much. The one thing that is a little different about this Beaumont book is that you see a sensitive side of him not seen in the rest of the series
4,Good book,"It's a good book, and the author describe the personalities of King George V's children quite well; particular the eldest two. There are only two problems I had with this book:(1) The copy that I had read, (which was new) apparently when they printed the book, on some of the pages the words are faded.(2)Some of the quotes that the author used were not consistant/right with the timeline of the book."
5,FRYE Men's Rogan Boot,"Like previous reviews have stated, go one size smaller than you would normally go. I'm usually a 9 to 9.5 sometimes a 10 depending on the brand, but I went with an 8 and it fit great with a little room at the toe. The leather is very stiff just above the ankle when putting the boot on, but with more and more wear, I think the leather will flex and loosen.This was the first pair of shoes/boots I've purchased online and my main concern was the size but overall they look great. The fit is pretty snug, but once broken in, they should loosen like any other new footwear."
2,Just so-so,"There is some good information in this video, but it jumps around a rather disjointed narrative. It wasn't the most entertaining to watch, something between a high school educational video and someone's first documentary production."
2,"To be fair, it's a TON of great clip art, but very unstable.","This software has a ton of great clip art and photos for use, but the browser software for it is a massive resource hog and very unstable. In order for me to use it, I have to shut down everything thats running on my system, and then launch the Masterclips browser. Even then, it still locks up.I uninstalled the software and put it on the shelf to collect dust."
3,Good Clip Art Collection,"This is a fair collection for the money. The 500K images you receive on 24 cds are adequate. To get the other 750K you have to subscribe (for free) to a 1 year online membership. After the free 1 year, you are back to 500K, so this is misleading. They should title it 1.25 million images for 12 months.The main problem I have are the disks are stored in cardboard albums. When mine arrived I removed the shrink wrap. Disk #1 (install & search disk) had fallen out of its slot and moved around within the album during shipment and was scratched making installation very difficult. After several attempts and un-installs, success! Search capabilites with this disk are now unstable. Some times it works, sometimes it doesn't. The remainder of the disks seem to be OK. The images we use most are the large collection of color workplace signs (No Smoking, No Parking, Exit, Fire Extinguisher, etc. This alone will pay offset the cost for most businesses."
5,If you're ready to change your life ...,"If you're ready to change your life, this is the book for you. Harrold's inspiring, motivating prose, delivered in short chapters designed to be read in ten minutes or less, are just the thing for boosting confidence when you don't have much time. Fiona Harrold doesn't mess around - she tells it like it is, and gives you the simple steps you need to follow if you want to make changes. It's no use waiting around for someone else to do things, says Harrold, you need to take responsibility and get out there! An ideal starter book for those who know that they need to make a change, but don't yet know how to do it."
4,Real Super-thin Pretzel Twist Taste and Texture,"These have a taste and texture surprisingly close to my favorite brand of super-thin pretzel twists. With the added benefit of only 1.5 grams of fat but 4 grams of fiber and 5 grams of protein. I do wish they came in ""serving"" size packages instead, though."
3,contains WHEAT!!,"We love Newman's products...but Amazon lists this as 'wheat-free'. The package ingredients label shows 'contains: Wheat'. Not a big deal unless you have a wheat allergy...which by the way LOTS of people do. Just thought I'd save you the hassle since food products aren't eligible for return. As far as taste, my husband (not a pretzel fan) tried one and gave them a 3 out of 5.... 'a little bland...need more salt.'"
5,Terrific Snack,"These were purchased for my husband. He declares them an excellent snack food and says these are very tasty, crisp and fresh. Since we have not been able to find these in a local grocery store, it is nice to be able to order them from Amazon. We definitely plan to order more when our supply runs low."
5,Delish!,"For Hi-Protein carb food, these pretzels are the best! Crisp texture, and a nicely well cooked (burnt) flavor which brings out the best in a pretzel, you can't go wrong with these. I like them better than any other pretzel I've have to date. If you think they are too salty, just rub the bag before opening and a lot of the salt falls off. I'm on my second order :)"
4,"""lil salty but good""","These pretzels are pretty good. By accident I ordered 2 boxes and had a ton of them. The expiration date was June and I got them in March and was kinda nervous, but we are down to out last 2 bags...many of our friends have enjoyed them! They are very crunchy because they are very thin. They are not like a snyders if that's what your looking for."
2,DOUBLED IN PRICE WITHIN A COUPLE OF WEEKS,"The pretzels are tasty and convenient, but I can't give them a higher rating due to the extreme jump in price (nearly double the price it was a couple of weeks ago when I made the purchase-around $17). Due to this, I assume the previous great reviews are based on the former price. Now I can pick these up at my local Grocery for close to the same price per bag, which defeats the purchase of buying in bulk online."
2,Disappointed,"I enjoy the Newman's Own Pretzels on a regular basis and decided to start buying them by the case as my local grocery store stopped carrying them. The first two cases I bought from a different distributor were fine, however in the last case I purchased from Amazon, all the pretzels tasted stale, although the bags weren't out of expiration and didn't appear to be opened. I was very disappointed with this batch."
3,"Sent me ""OLD"" product","I ordered a case of these pretzels to give away as snacks--I ordered it on Dec 17 and when it came, it had the ""Use By Dec 27, 2011"" date stamped on each bag. I'm not happy that they sent me ""old"" product that is nearing the end of its shelf life."
2,Tasty but Burnt and Salty,"OK so pretzels are supposed to be salty, but these are a tad too salty. They also have a burnt flavor. You could say this is a distinctive smokey flavor, but 12 bags ahead of you with the prospects of an unsatisfied pallett is a mighty tall order. On the other hand the subtle sweet flavors are good. This is not your ordinary pretzel try them in safety first (instead of buying 12 bags). Also note grocery items cannot be returned to Amazon!"
4,GOOD STUFF!,"I like buying Paul Newman products because the profits go to his camp for ill children. And they taste good too. These pretzels fit that bill. And I believe the price is reasonable, as well. It's great to eat pretzels that have a good amount of protein in them, unlike the ""average"" pretzel with just a bunch of carbohydrates. All my family and friends like them too. The only little downside, for me, is they taste a bit too salty. However, the rest of my family didn't find them too salty and thought they were just fine. They are low in fat, with 4 grams of fiber and 5 grams of protein per serving. I will definitely buy Paul Newman's Organic Pretzels again and again."
3,"Pretty good, but seemed to go stale",I found that about a month before the expiration date these tasted stale to me. So have several bags left from the case I bought that are not that good anymore. I bought the sniders organic pretzels and those held up better.
1,Mine Also BURNT flavor!,"I purchased the High Protein Pretzels. I've had Newman's Own Organic Pretzels before and they tasted great - but these are not good at all. 95% of the salt is at the bottom of the bag (have to have salt on pretzels!) and they have an overwhelming flavor of being burnt and not a good burnt either! I have no use now for all these pretzels and i can't imagine anyone enjoying this taste!It is upsetting to see that a few others also ended up with the High Protein pretzels having this awful BURNT flavor and yet they still kept sending them out. I'd think maybe they'd look at batch numbers or something to prevent them from being shipped out to dissatisfied customers who will give it a bad review.Generally Newman's Pretzels are really good, but buy these at your own risk...."
5,Fantastic Pretzels,"We try to avoid wheat here and there, so we love substituting with spelt. These pretzels are great. They've been a regular snack in our pantry for a couple of years now. Taste just like ""regular"" pretzels, only much healthier!"
3,good price,"Purchased these on sale around superbowl time when we go through lots of dips. Normally buy locally, but the town was sold out and we try to be as organic as possible. Family has mixed reviews about taste & texture."
2,Not so good & close to expiry,"These might be OK for hi-protein pretzels but they are not so good as pretzels, period. In addition, the bags I received will expire in less than 3 months. I am not pleased."
1,"Well, here's an idea....","Why not have, in the listing of a given item, details on what the item IS?! I have many Milton Berle shows; I'm looking for more. But, if the manufacturer fails to supply any facts concerning dates, cast, and content, there's no way of telling if I already have the episodes in question or not. So, unless I feel like gambling, I pass on purchasing. Far too many listings of books and other media items actively discourage sales by not telling potential buyers exactly what they would be getting."
2,Remastered? Not Likely,"This is a really good Disc, but the description says that it's an Import and Remastered.All I got was Updated Artwork in the CD Clear Tray with the same crappy issue of the CD from 15 years ago.Buyer Beware. Disc Info states 1982, No Where in the liner notes does this discindicate ""REMASTERING"" Same goes for ZEBOP!"
4,Nueva York!,"I have seen and heard alot of negative reviews over the years about this release. However, ""Nueva York"" is a classic tune. This piece of music, alone, is worth the purchase. If you are a person that enjoys music and has an ear for Carlos, you may enjoy a few tracks on 'Shango'. The aforementioned, of course, but also, 'Body Surfing', 'Let Me Inside' and 'Night Hunting Time' have some interesting passages going on. I am not a big Alex Ligertwood fan, but, if you can phase out the vocals on a few tracks, the music is there to be be enjoyed."
4,Much underrated...,"Santana are the undisputed champions of 'latin-rock';this 1982 album is revelatory for their uncanny ability to combine sounds and cultures into one,fantastic musical melange,all penetrated by Carlos'genius and musical vision.Essential for any Santana fan."
2,Sleekly bland,"An encroaching eighties deadened production aesthetic really took its toll on the once vibrant jammers, producing another stinker in the midst of a cold streak and justified in all sell-out criticisms when witnessing continuously calibrated-for-airplay Journey-isms at the expense of organic Latin fire (tacked on and rehashed for appeasement occasionally though it may be)."
4,Best Buy - American Woodworker,"From AW #79 (April 2000), which can also be viewed online at the American Woodworker website.HITACHI SB 75 is an excellent 3 in. x 21 in. sander. It has the highest amp motor in the group, the dust bag works well and it has two speeds. It would be handier if the low end of the speed range were lower, but it works OK. A weak spot is the belt-change lever. It's pointy and hard to pull. Get the bench stand to really make this one versatile.8.7 amps, 1180/1475 FPM (feet per minute), 10 lbs."
1,Inadequate,"This unit looked like a 4"" x 21"" BELT SANDER. THE 3"" SANDING BELT HAD OVER 1"" OF SPACE LEFT ON THE SURFACE OF SANDER SIDE TO SIDE. THAT MEANS YOU WOULD NOT KNOW WHAT AREA THE SANDER WAS SANDING.If it had a 4"" belt it would look OK.Looks like someone made it with left over 4"" sander parts. VERY POOR DESIGN."
3,Not the greatest,"I have always been very happy with Hitachi tools, so whan I decided to upgrade from the ""disposable"" models I have used in the past, I saw that the Hitachi had more amps and a low price. After recieving the sander, I tried it out on some 8/4 oak and it bogged down almost to a standstill with not a lot of pressure. I took it to a tool repair and they did a hundred dollars work on it(free for me with warranty) and it seemed to ahve fixed it. Now with only a few more uses, it seems I am almost back to the way it was. If I had it to do over, I would go with Porter-Cable."
5,Paul Carrack CD,Love this CD. A friend shared a Paul Carrack song on FB. I had never heard of him. I went to iTunes and downloaded a few songs. They had a limited selection of his music. So glad I ordered this CD.
5,Another great book by the 3 Guys from Miami,"I love the 1st book by the 3 Guys from Miami. So I could not wait to order this book. It's everything I thought it would be. Great recipes, great writing. If you enjoyed the first book, you will love this book."
5,Three Guys from Miami Celebrate Cuban,"Excellent Book. I bought one for a friend and she loved it so I had to buy my own after. Love my book. Very well made, beautiful recipes, beautiful pictures, just lovely."
5,Celebrate This Book!,"Every recipe that I have made from this book has been excellent. The garlic chicken is our favorite! The anecdotes by the ""3 Guys"" are cute and informative. I highly recommend this book."
2,So-So,The first book from these authors was excellent. This one is not as good. There are many others in the Cuban cuisine that merit to be in the book.
5,"A great follow up to ""The Heavens Opened""","Anna, an intercessor and humble woman of God, does well in her 3 years of research to produce this book. It will bless you and grant you deeper insight into Father's love for all who seek Him."
2,"A good choice for people who understand ""God talk""","I wanted to like this book, I really did. It was given to me by someone who loved it and who was really impacted by it. I, on the other hand, had a hard time getting into it. I found the vocabulary to be for ""insiders"" and while I can see how this would be fine for people who have experienced God in this way, I had a hard time connecting with the experience."
1,even 1 star is to high a rating,"When I finish reading a book, I either pass it on or donate to the public library. This book I am throwing in the trash."
4,Pokes around in those recesses of the brain most would rather keep hidden,"Eric McFadden was has played mandolin for George Clinton and guitar for Eric Burden, plus had his own trios, including this one and the Faraway Brothers. Here he joins forces Paolo Baldi on percussion and James Whiton on acoustic bass.The results are a dark, festive romp that will keep you off kilter and make you wonder why Mr. McFadden is not better known. Perhaps he is just a bit too unconventional or perhaps he pokes around in those recesses of the brain most would rather keep hidden.Regardless, he brings a madcap energy to his guitar and mandolin playing and sings in a rich, almost scary voice. Baldi whips the drums into shape, and Whiton must be a blur on bass. Good stuff here for those who have a spirit of musical adventure."
3,Not a winner by a long shot.,"I actually ordered this, just because it's the only CD where you can get Ms. Pitre's version of ""The Winner Takes it All"" from Mamma, which is definitive, for the sheer lack of any other. I was quite taken by her performance in Mamma, so I thought that I had to have her version by hook or by crook. Well, I was actually quite disappointed with the way it was recorded in this album. In retrospect, I think I only enjoyd that song in the show, because it was the only aria, and I never even thought it was an Abba piece. The french version of the song is interesting, but I just wonder where it would be performed as part of Mamma - definitely not in Paris, because we all know how they can't swallow musicals - especially the commercial success, but very plotless, Mamma. The rest of the songs in the album are quite good, but I don't see. feel, or hear a diva here."
2,short lived enthusiasm,"This vacuum has lots of versatility and is powerful enough to get the job done. The fact that the head of the vacuum is smaller makes for more passes but it can get into the smaller spaces. What ""sucks"" about this machine is that the wheels are mounted on plastic housing and in no time at all wear out and fall of. Bummer having a vacuum that is missing a wheel. This thing was not the easiest to push with two wheels. You can imagine what its like with one. Don't purchase this machine unless you plan on not having a vacuum while its in the shop for repairs. At least it will not be too heavy when I carry it out to the dumpster."
4,great little machine,"first- thanks to all who shared their comments that helped me make my decision! O.K. this thing is awesome. Forget about what others have said in the negative comments about the forward exhaust. It's true, but it's so powerful, it is of no consequence. Very strong sucking power, easy to use on carpeted stairs, great on carpet, great on bare floors. 1100 sqft of mixed floors and very happy with the optima."
2,bad design but pretty color,"The wheels are very difficult to roll. It is 13lbs. It is not what the description says. I don't like it, so I return it. It is impossible to take the parts off as it shipped. I have to pack it in an extra big box not the orginal shipping box. It is very painful to return the item like this. Although, Amazon pays the shipping fee. I will go to store to make sure the model before I order it next time."
3,Descent for price,"I bought this vacuum because I was tired of sweeping our hardwood floors. We have 2 dogs and need to do upkeep daily. There are 3 settings on this vacuum...one the sucks, one that uses the brush and one that goes to the hose. When on suck only (indicated for hardwood) it tends to blow the hair as it approaches so I mostly vacuum hardwood and carpet using the brush option (indicated for carpet). There is a cylinder which is easy to remove and dump but most of the hair and dirt get caught at the top around the filter...so you will need to dump and clean filter frequently. If you are allergic to dust - this is not the vacuum for you....as dumping the canister doesn't clean the filter. I find that using a small brush and beating the bottom of the filter and brushing it out is the only thing that works. Last con...short cord but of course this seems to be a problem for all vacs! It is lightweight and an option for when I don't want to bring out the big guns!"
1,Spend the money on something better,"The Optima motor burned out after only a few months of light use. And, to even get to see the belt I had to remove about 10 screws. The owner's manual didn't even include a diagram or information on how to inspect or change the belt. I've had Hoovers and Dysons and they have lasted for many years; I made a mistake buying this thing because I had limited space in the closet on my first floor."
2,Frustrated,Not sure how good it works because the handle does not stay on. I called Eureka and they sent me a new handle but the handle doesn't have the plastic insert you need to hold it in place. Frustrated already !!!
3,"kinda sucks, but is nice for a while","I bought one 4 years ago, which broke after 3 years. I liked it enough to buy another last year but that one's already broken (motor burned out).Pros:cheap!very powerful and lightsmall enough to store easilyCons:all the accessories are cheap and kinda useless--fall off when stored, don't fit on properlythe hose is somewhat stiff and doesnt stretch wellbreaks a lotthe on/off switch, and the switch to go from floor to hose are not very conveniently situated.If you need something cheap, powerful, and probably not for more than a year or so, this might be a good option. My next will be a dyson."
1,Not a good choice.,The Eureka Maxima is a MUCH better choice and costs about the same. Consumer Reports strongly recommends AGAINST buying the Optima due to it's poor cleaning performance and bad build quality.
1,It Blows (Literally),"The vent on this vacuum is on the front, so that when you push forward to suck up dust, the vent blows it away before the vacuum gets there. It works more like a leaf blower than a vacuum."
2,You get what you pay for.,"I hate that it blows dust and hair around in front of itself on hardwood floors! I didn't expect much with the least expensive 12amp I could find, but I can't believe they justify selling a counter-productive machine. The filter needs to be replaced after maybe 10-15 uses (vacuuming a newer 630 sq ft apartment)."
2,Blows dust bunnies across the room,"I have hardwood floors and this vacuum blows the dust bunnies across the floor. I chase after them, trying to get them. It is so frustrating. The exhaust from the motor blows them. When I called customer service. They told me they were aware of the problem. Hmmm. However, they weren't doing anything about it. I suppose if you have carpet, this might work for you. It seemed to have pretty good suction. However I think it is gross emptying the compartment and cleaning the filter. I hate doing it! I am still looking for a lightweight vacuum that I can use in between my heavy cleaning with my Electrolux."
2,Got what I paid for...,"I'm really surprised seeing so many positive reviews for this product. Sounds, like some Eureka fans are trying to promote this vacuum. If you read only 1-2 stars review you'll see what this product is really is. It can't handle rugs, it scratches the floor and it send dust flying all over the room because of a badly placed exhaust. The tank is hard to clean. Cleaning the filter take about 10 minutes, dirty hands and lungs full of dust.The pluses are it's light and very powerful. That's the only reason why I gave it 2 starts..."
1,Horrible - do not buy,"Don't believe the hype with this machine. I did and ended up returning it to Amazon. It is extremely hard to push. But worse than that, the filter is in the same location as the dirt collector cup! That means that the filter gets clogged after vacuuming just 2 rooms. You have to take a toothbrush to manually clean the filter EVERY TIME you use it. Horrible design! In fact, Eureka finally figured it out and created another model correcting this mistake. The new model says, ""Now the filter is not in the collection cup"" on the box. Apparently a lot of people complained. Avoid this one."
3,Almost a good design,"The exhaust is on the front, so it blows items in front of the vacuum (dust, debris, etc) around before you can vacuum it. Additionally, the hose end frequently works itself loose from the retaining cup. Very annoying. Otherwise, good idea, just a poor implementation. Hopefully they can fix these issues in an upcoming model. I exchanged it and got a retractable cord Hoover, Love it."
2,Loud and hard to clean,The dust and dog hairs get caught in the filter. Not a good vacuum if you have dogs. It is loud and the air comes out in the front so you have a fan moving your dirt around before the vacuum can suck it up.
1,Does not suck!,I bought this vaccuum for my finished basement. It does not suck at all! I feel it was a waste of my money!
2,Not for people with pets,This vacuum blows the pet hair into the air on laminate flooring therefore making it impossible to eliminate hair and dust.
2,Disappointed in New York,"I'm sorry to say that my husband & I were disappointed with the performance of this vacuum. We wanted to purchase a vacuum that was specifically designed for hard wood floors. Thankfully this vacuum hasn't scratched our new hard wood floors, however it doesn't seem to pick up particles or dirt easily. It seems to blow them across the room. Disappointed with our purchase. :(-- New York Customer"
3,Not for Plush Carpeting,"It has great suction, love the adjustable handle, does great on hard floors and area rugs, BUT it won't roll at all on my plush carpeting. I tried it with the roller in the up position and it still won't go without a tremendous amount of effort and then the orange light comes on. It pushes like my Hoover did when the belt would slip off the roller. I was so excited to have a light-weight vacuum for easy clean up, but this is impossible. It needs bigger wheels or something. What a disappointment!"
3,could use some improving,"Bought this for the upstairs where we have area rugs and bare floors - keeps from having to lug the Bosch Cannister (a super vacuum) up and down when just a quick vac is nesessary. Suction is excellent - but the unit is very very loud (maybe the Bosch is just that quiet). Exhausted air is pushed out the front and blows much of what is on a bare floor away prior to being able to vacuum it up. Filter should have a pre sleeve on it - like the foam ones you can by for a shop vac - it gets clogged easily and is difficult to clean, I found putting a stocking over it helps. If you cannot keep it clean - might as well have a bag! Handle is great and adjusts easily to many different heights. Dusting tool is positioned at the wrong angle - adjustable would be nice and should include a smaller floor sweeper and another extension pole. All in all not too bad but could be better with some work. Look around before you by - I would probably choose another if doing over."
4,Great Deal,"This unit is easy to set up, compact and great buy. As is the same with other Eureka products, it has the problem of air coming out IN FRONT and blowing the dust away though, suction is great and much less noise compared to my old Dirt Devil Jaguar. As it is still a week since I started using this unit, I cannot mention anything about durability, but I have an impression this one is manufactured and made up well from its structure. This compact and light weight unit is ideal as a second vacuum cleaner, and also could be used as the single unit for a family living in an apartment with great suction and easy handling, I suppose. The air blowing out in front is the only, and not a small issue so I rate one star less than five."
2,You sometimes get what you pay for.,"I assume you have read all the good reviews of this vacuum cleaner and I agree with much of what they say so I wont belabor those points. Here is my summary:LIKES1. light2. Rug brush can be disabled (turned off)3. Great suction for its size.4. HEPPA filter.5. Tools attached.6. Simple switch from floor to hose.7. BaglessDON'T LIKES1. Hose too short2. Filter clogs too fast. Dirt tank emptying annoying and ""dirty.""3. Small plastic parts break easily (cord holder, dirt chamber latch)SUMMARYLike it, use it, looks a bit ummm wounded with duct tape holding it together."
4,wowww!!!!!,"Great suction. Small, compact. Cannot believe the power. Only complaint - the suction when using the hose is not as powerful as the vac on the rug, however it does such a great jobon edges that tou'd hardly ever use this feature. Love itUPDATE Oct,2012. When this unit died years later I ordered another one and stand by original review LOVE THIS VACUUM!"
4,4 stars,"This vacuum is lightweight at 11 lbs. and easy to use. It sits on plastic rollers so you will have to practically drag this across carpetted floors. Fortunately I have small rooms so its no hassle for me. The only con is that you have to buy the filters online (about $11) because most stores will not carry to the filter. Also, I was hoping for a smaller, quieter vacuum but this one is just as loud as any other.I highly recommend purchasing this for small homes or tiled/wood floors."
3,I like it,"What I like about this vac* The color, size and design.* The cord lenght is good for this size vac.* Price of 59.99 was a good value.* Cleans as well or better than most lower priced vacs.* Extra filter included in box. Dust cup is very easy to remove.what I didnt like about this vac.* Assembly was a little hard as directions were not the clearest.I had a hard time installing the hose holder.* I find it to be quite noisy.It's small but just as loud as any other vac.* The wheels are not great and this vac is not smooth to push.I worry about them scratching or marring my hardwood floors.Overall I like this vac. The most impressive thing about is it's color and design.Cleaning wise I think it is just a average vac."
1,Cannot be worse,"This machine works for about a week. After that, you have to empty the canister (and inhale half of the dust that was in it), and subsequently you need to clean by hand all the dirt and grime from the filter, which take about 20 minutes, since it gets completely clogged.If you are looking for a disposable vacuum cleaner that you can discard after 5 uses, this is the one."
2,Filter clogs and causes vacuum to lose suction,"We have had this Vacuum for about 1 year and use the vacuum 1 to 2 times per week. The vacuum cleaner is light and has a lot of power. Its a little noisy but, the real problem with this vacuum is the filtering system. The filter gets clogged very fast. Once the filter gets clogged the vacuum doesn't suction (I suspect this is the problem that some of the other reviewers have had). The only way I've found to adequately clean the filter is with a needle-nosed pliers and about 10-15 minutes of my time. I do this approximately every 2 or 3 times I vacuum. Vacuum works well and nothing has fallen apart but this filter cleaning thing is a real hassle and for that reason I would not recommend this vacuum."
3,"Cleans great, hard to push","This little machine will clean. The only problem is you will get heart palpatations from the pushing. If you don't mind a work out when you clean, this is the vacuum for you."
2,"vacuum sucks, figuratively speaking","I have had this vac for about 2 years. I use it infrequently on smooth tile floors. Despite light duty use, it has fallen to pieces.Indictment:1)Handle is cheaply assembled and wiggles back and forth sloppily (within a few weeks of light use)2)vac has switch to go from vac to attachment. broke within a year3)fan on front of vac blows away whatever it is your trying to vac up4)cheapo plastic ronald mcdonald wheels. one fell off today5)cannister filter design attracts debris to filter so it clogs easily, reducing suction6)hose attachment comes detached frequentlyVacuum is very light. If your only criteria is weight and ""cute"", you cannot find a greater vacuum."
2,Not my bag of chips,"I was not very happy with this vacuum. It broke after 1 year, and I barely vacuum! It was pretty cheap, I guess you get what you pay for. It was pretty light though."
3,Nice vac if it lastest more than 3 months,I bought this vac based on all the reviews. It is small and light. my 4 year old could use it. You do need to empty it often because the canister is small. cord is a little short but not a big problem. I liked because of the ease of carrying it up stairs and storage. But yesterday it quit sucking up. I'm glad I bought it from best buy because I would be very upset if I had to mail it back to amazon. Not sure If I will get another one because it didn't last.
1,wheels broke off after 6 months,"Worked ok but now useless, the wheel casings broke and the wheels won't stay on"
1,It sucks;,"I got this as a gift, but I had to throw this away just in 2months. I like to keep my duplex house very clean and I have a todller who is one and half year old. SO I vacuum at least every other day. But It doesn't suck very well specially on floor. I spilt some grain on carpet today but the vaccum doesn't suck the grain cleanly while my todller wait for my cleaning done. It really is disappointing, I smelled some burns inside the machine so I felt to garbage is safe than to struggle to use for nothing"
3,Not as great as I expected!,"I purchased the Eureka 431A based on the great reviews it got. Well, it has great power to suck in dirt and hair; BUT, if you're not careful and tilt it back before you start it, AND tilt it back far enough, it'll blow away all that you're trying to pick up. Will definitely be returning it. I do not recommend it for non-carpeted flooring."
1,You get what you pay for...,"I was so excited to receive this vacuum based on the reviews, price and because it's green. Ha. Anyway, it's been less than satisfactory. It is too heavy for what it is. It blows dust around. It is NOT good on hardwood floors. Just an awful vacuum. I'm going to replace the Dirt Devil Breeze I just gave away. It still worked great after four years."
2,Wheels pop off,"I bought this vacuum for it's bagless convenience, light weigh, self storing tools and good price point. With in a few weeks the wheels popped off. They do not snap back on. They now pop off and scratch my floor every time I vacuum. Do not buy this product!"
2,Love and Hate !,What the heck was Eureka thinking when they made this vacuum! They have a switch to turn off the beater bar which is great for my hardwood floors but they put the exhaust fan in the front and I spend more time chasing the dust bunnies that this vac throws around than I do catching them. Not to bright for a company thats been around as long as them. It has great suction and works great on carpet though..only draw back with this is the dust cup is way to small and you feel like you are constantly emptying it out. I would think twice before buying this vac if you intend on using it for your hardwood floors unless you need and want alot of exercise chasing bunny's!!!
2,Just awful,"When I first bought this product I was impressed with its power and how lightweight it was, but after owning it for a while, I'm absolutely disgusted with it and looking to buy something else (anyone who has any suggestions, please share)The one problem that makes this product pretty much worthless is the fact that after vacuuming for around 3-4 minutes it automatically shuts off to let the motor cool down. How long does it take to cool down? At least a half an hour!! So if I want to clean my fully carpeted second floor, which only consists of four small rooms, it will take over 3 hours. It should take 10 minutes, but I have to wait for the Fricking thing to cool down every time.Don't buy this product. It's just awful."
2,Disappointed this time,"I had the older model of this unit and needed to replace it so I bought this one. When I started using it a very strong plastic smell filled my room. I thought it was because it was new so I rinsed out the canister and ran it for a little while. The smell in my room lingered for a day. I used the vacuum again after cleaning it and the same result. I sent it back for a replacement and the replacement came in smelling the same way so I didn't even take it out of the box, just shipped it back. So disappointed because this vacuum is a good little vacuum."
1,Worst little vacuum ever,"I only use this vacuum in my kitchen before I wash the tile floor. It is a large area, but it is all 12"" tiles, they are much easier to vacuum than a rug with pile. I would say that over the few years I have had this, my usage would be light compared to other owners who use this as their main vacuum or use it on their rugs. I have limited usage for this vacuum because I have a large, self propelled Hoover vacuum to do all the wall to wall carpeting; and I use a dust mop for all the wood floors. So this little number is limited to kitchen use before I wash the floor. The wheel keeps breaking off! I have used Crazy Glue to repair it several times, but alas, there is no permanent fix. Frankly, I think Amazon should stop carrying the product because my experience is similar to a number of other owners' experience. This vacuum is so below par because the parts are so cheap, especially the wheels."
4,ok... but a bit bulky,"We bought this to replace a Eureka 416a (blue stick vac flat head) that we bought 7 years ago. First let me say that when the wheel broke from my 416a after 7 years of daily use I was crushed. That little vacuum was the best stick vac I have ever owned. We tried a Dirt Devel and returned, tried a bissell and returned. We are going to keep the Eureka Optima shown above. It has about the same power as the old 416a but is a bit bulky for my purposes. The collapsing handle is convenient. The filter which has a design similar to my old 416a seems to get dirt and debris trapped at the locking point and is a bit harder to clean than the old filter. All in all it should do the job... guess I'm just in mourning for my old 416a buddy."
3,"Light to Carry, Heavy to Push","I bought this vacuum because of its light weight. It is easy to carry around, great suction, but unfortunately, is hard to push, negating any advantage over those heavier vacuums that have a glide function. The vacuumhead is not very wide, necessitating a lot of push/pull against a fair amount of resistance. The above floor hose is too short for half the proposed uses, and the dust cup is small. It is a decent vacuum for anyone not needing the advantages of a light vacuum cleaner and bargain priced."
2,Consider it a short-term investment,"The vac worked very well and had great features for the price, including the brush roller on/off. The motor is strong and the unit is quite lightweight. However, in less than a year, the handle started loosening and could not be resecured; this was simply annoying. Last week, we lost a wheel, and after further investigation, we realized that the wheel had simply SPUN IN A CIRCLE too much and wore the thin plastic clips securing the wheel right off. Barring some amazing repair work, I think it has died. It is a shame that this vacuum in now garbage because of such a stupid flaw. I guess I have a giant dustbuster now."
1,If only I could give it zero stars...,"I read the reviews posted on here, and thought, gee, this seems like a pretty good vacuum. Quite wrong, I can assure you.I have never left a review online. However, this product was *so bad* that it overpowered my laziness and forced me to rate it. I just finished ""vacuuming"" (and I use that term loosely), and I must say, other than the lines on the floor, you really couldn't tell. I ran over the same little piece of string on my carpet about six times before bending over and picking it up. And yes, all of you naysayers, I did have the thing set to suck through the floor and not the tube. And suck it did, but not in the way that I purchased it to do.Avoid this product."
4,Pleasantly surprised!!!,I own a small condo with mostly hardwood floors except a couple of rooms with carpet so I didn't want to spend $400 on an upright vacuum. I really hesitated buying one that was so inexpensive but decided if it didn't work well at least I wouldn't be out alot of $$$. This thing works GREAT!! I couldn't believe how good a job it did. The ergonomic handle makes it easy to carry around the house (plus it's light as a feather) and since i don't have alot of storage in my condo the size (with telescoping handle that goes down) is perfect for tucking into the back of a closet. I would have given it 5 stars except the only thing that would make this better would be a retracting power cord instead of having to wrap it around the maching when your done...small price to pay for such a big savings over the 'big dog' machines.
1,The worst ever vacuum cleaner in the market!! period!!,"Give it just 2 weeks!! and to top it off, the customer service sucks big time!! They told me that they will mail an accessory 4 months ago- I am still waiting!!! Don't buy this if you want to save 70 good bucks!!"
4,Neat little Green Machine,"This is a nice little vacuum. It is my first bagless and I will have to say, I'm not real keen on bagless. I really would prefer to have a bag and then just throw it away when it's full. I don't like cleaning the filter each time I use it. With that said, I really am amazed how well this vacuums up dirt. As others have said, I vacuumed with my old vacuum and then used this little guy and wow, I was amazed. My carpets even look better! If you have a big area to vacuum, this machine isn't for you, but for smaller homes or areas, it's great and lightweight too! I only dropped a star off because of it being bagless...."
1,Wheels fall off,"While this is small, convenient, powerful and inexpensive, the plastic wheels and plastic axles may be the first to go. My mother has one, it gets used once/week in a one-bedroom apartment. After 3 years of use, the plastic tabs on the axles that hold the plastic wheels have broken off, and there's no way to fix them. Eureka Customer service can only sell you a new base at $79.99, which is more than the vacuum costs. I've called and pleaded with them to send me a new base free, which after doing some web research, I've found they've done for others - they'll call me back in 1 to 2 days. Clearly a design flaw - probably pays in the long run pay a bit more and get a better-made vacuum. Personally, I have a 16 year old Miele that I paid $400 for. It's VERY quiet, well-designed, and still works perfectly."
3,Some deficiencies,"It is a good cleaner, however it blows the dirt ahead of it since the discharge is on front of it. It is also hard to push, not much differrent than my full size Hoover."
3,Beware of filter,"Sure this vacuum has great suction power but everything ends up in the filter, inside the little accordian folds and it's impossible to get out, this in turn is going to clog the filter which in turn will give less suction. Bought this for my kids to use upstairs so it will fufill my needs but would not reccomend for a large home, you will lose your mind trying to clean it!"
2,Good but with problems,This vacuum works very well at picking up dirt and being lightweight and convenient. And it is especially handy for those that like disposable items. Because this is a disposable vacuum cleaner. Use it for a while and the wheels will start to fall off. So much so that my wife is about to pull her hair out. The wheels are plastic on plastic contraptions and soon as a little dust or dirt gets in their they start wearing away rapidly till they fall off. If it wasnt for the wheel problem this would be in my opinion at least a 4 star vacuum. But then we have had it about a year and thats probably the reason they only carry a one year warranty.
1,NOT DESIGNED FOR HARD-WOOD FLOORS,"When you think of a Eureka product, you would normally think about a high-quality engineered product. NOT IN THIS CASE...!!!The air discharge from the unit blows on the area that your about to clean. This discharge blows dirt & dust all over the place, if, your using it to clean hard-wood floors. After you use this for a period of time, you'll notice that you will have excessive dust build-up on your tables & furniture.Save yourself some money and buy a leaf-blower. It will be much faster and you can use it outdoors!"
2,Absurd design,"This vacuum has excellent suction. And the canister empties easily and fits well. But the exhaust is in the FRONT, so that everything you intend to pick up gets blown into the air. Absurd design. It's also a bit heavy to be considered a lightweight and is very cumbersome and difficult to maneuver."
2,Cute and modern but NOT functional,"I bought this upright b/c I was tired of lugging around a heavy and bulky vacuum. I have been extremely disappointed with it. It is cheaply made; the hose always falls off during vacuuming, and the adjustable handle always goes up and down b/c it won't stay fastened (it has just a cheap, plastic fastening system), which makes for an extremely annoying, not to mention laborious, vacuuming experience. This thing is not as lightweight as it is advertised to be either. Suction is good, however, and clean up is easy with no bag to empty or replace. Overall, I think this product fails to deliver on its promise."
5,I'm in love with this vaccum!!!,"Granted, I've only had it for one day, but so far it's the best vaccum I've ever owned! I've vaccumed dust off the ceiling fan (while balancing the optima on the ladder with me.) I've gotten my cheap Ikea carpets cleaner than they've ever been (I used to have to clean them with a lint brush, no other vaccum could do the job). I've used it as a mini shop vac to clean out the forced air heat vents and it pulled out a pencil, steel wool, a dry wall screw, and tons of dirt and dust, all without getting clogged. All that and it does hardwood floors. It's very easy to empty, it's a great size, very nicely designed, and it's cute too! As an added bonus it comes with an extra filter. I actually look forward to vaccuming now, and I hate cleaning. Do yourself a favor and get this vaccum!"
2,I guess I got what I paid for!,"I like this vacuum when you have a new filter in it. Other than that, which is just about every time I use it, it has lost so much suction and pulls up nothing. We bought this smaller vacuum b/c it claimed to be the same power as a full size upright. Not so. It doesn't do a thorough job, and I don't recommend it as your primary vacuum. I will say it is ok if you are doing light cleaning."
1,Quite inconvenient,"I used it 2.5 times. Then it stopped running at a nice vigorous whir and groaned slowly. I turned it off and read the owner's manual. The book says the machine will shut itself down if it gets too hot. The cure is to give it a 1/2 hour break. I gave it a 1-week break and tried again. After vacuuming about 125 sq ft, it slowed and groaned again. It has seen only very light service. I live by myself in a 1-br apartment, and I'm pretty clean. Most of the rug just lies there unused. I detest doing housework, but I vacuum the rug once a month (or maybe once in 6 weeks) whether it needs it or not. The machine broke down after very little use. I checked the refund policy and I'd had it too long for that. I checked the warranty, and I was covered, so I took it to the shop. Two weeks later, I got it back and gave the carpet some long overdue attention. The vacuum works ok now."
5,I was blown away---Dust bunnies run for your life!,"I just ordered this vacuum 2 days ago and took the free shipping from Amazon. I have it in 2 days. WOW! It only took me 5 minutes to put it together, NO tools needed. Everything just snaps in place. I had unpacked it on the living room floor and little pieces of styrofoam were all over the place. I used it right there and I couldn't believe my eyes. This vacuum is VERY POWERFUL. It sucks in dust before you even roll over it. My carpet has never looked so good. Don't know what I'll do with my old upright. This cutie little guy out shines it by a mile.So if you are debating if you should buy it...JUST DO IT! You will not be sorry. It does everything it claims to do and more. I will agree with those who say it is a bit hard to push, but it's not bad. I have physical disabilities and I can do it with no problem. I debated for months when I could have been enjoying cleaner carpets. Buy the way this $54.99 is less expensive than any store in my town."
3,Just a for a while...,"Since I am moving out on my own in an apartment and my physical activity is limited by lower back pain, I knew I needed a lightweight vacuum. The reviews on the Eureka are pretty mixed, but I am just relieved that I found this at Best Buy. It does have strong motor and picks up my pet's fur. The thing is...it blows air through the front of the vacuum. It says to replace the filter every 6 MONTHS which would be not so great on a limited income. To sum up my review,I would have to rate it a 3 star."
2,hyped reviews not the best not even close!,Great as a second vac;but drawbacks abound.I got this based on the reviews but....the cord is too short;the vac feels cheap; the head of the vac is very small which means it will take longer to finish the job..Only.lvpositive. Iside iIt doesn't have a wheel height adjustment.When you put this together and start it there is a sickening plastic smell.Emptying the plastic canister. (Which is recommended each time you use it)creates a mess with dust and dirt airborne.Other reviewers said it was easy to push...only on floors.Weighs 11lbs light.This is going back!
2,Are you kidding?,"I don't know what these reviewers have been smoking, but this vacume is neither ""super"" or ""mighty"". It is cheap, that is why I bought it, and about four other people I know.Over the last year it has LOST A LOT OF SUCTION CABABILITY(I am on amazon to find a replacement and just thought I would check this as a benchmark), if not all. It also OVERHEATSAND SHUTS OFF half the time I use it for more than 20 minutes.It is easy to clean, I have to admit, and light... but what good is that if it does not perform?Two stars is the most I can give this vacuum, my wife would probably give it 0."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"After light using aproximately twice a week using it on a very small area (300 sq feet) the motor started overheating heavily and then stopped working after 1 month of use. When motor cools down, the vacuum cleaner will work again for a short time for about 10 min."
4,Great deal,I have owned this vacuum for about 5 years. Not only is it affordable. It is a great vacuum. I was tired of canister vacuums where you always have to keep replacing bands and bags. This vacuum has worked well consistently for years. The only reason I don't give it a '5' is that the cord is a bit short. All in all it has been the best vacuum I have ever owned far outperforming many more expensive ones.
4,Excellent small vacuum,"We moved into a home w/a lot more hardwood floors than we had before. I wanted a smaller vacuum to use as an adjunct to my large vacuum. The Eureka Optima really fit the bill. It is light and MUCH more easy to maneuver than my bigger Eureka. (I still use the big one for the big areas on a regular basis.) This Optima is great, though, because it really picks up the hair, dust and debris very well (we have 2 dogs and 2 cats). I can easily dump out the debris from the cup, which easily pops in and out. I also use the hose on my big vacuum to hose out the filter and cup in the small vacuum, to keep it really cleaned out (although you can clean it pretty easily w/out using another vacuum to do so). It is great for quickie jobs and tight spots. I understand there is a hepa filter and I may purchase one of those soon. I like it better than a stick vacuum that I have had for a while since it seems to vacuum better."
3,So-so,"Man I REALLY should have read these reviews! I live in a fairly large size apt with both floor and carpets. And a big dog. This thing traps every single dog hair between the filter (which is at the top of the dust cup?) and where the filter clips into the dust cup in a teeny little nook. Sooo... Every time I empty the dust cup I must take the filter off, shake it out (while trying to avoid re-spreading the dust in the filter around) and then put it all back together. That being said it has good features too. It's small, light weight, and seems to clean well. It has good suction so far but it's only been 5 months."
2,YUK! What Happened?,"I used to have a Eureka Optima Vacuum (red) in a slightly different model, that worked beautifully. I have now tried this model (431DX) for the second time and I'm returning it. Why? It cleans well. It looks good. It's compact. It has strong suction. All the things I liked with my first Optima. But this one has a terrible odor when you vacuum. I can see this happening if you've had your vacuum for awhile or fail to clean the filter, but this is brand new out of the box. What is going on here? My son just walked in the house and wanted to know what the awful smell was....needless to say, all the doors are open to air out the house. Thank goodness for Amazon's great customer service on returns."
5,Little but extreme!,I bought this vacuum with some hesitance but received it last week in the mail and it has been the best vacuum I've ever owned...little but extreme when it comes to picking up dirt!
1,Dissapointed,"Bought this vacuum six months ago. Easy to put together. Loved it at first. After two months the sucking power started to dwindle. Four months after that the little indicator light that the brush had hair in it came on. I checked the brush and it was hair free but the brush still wouldn't roll. I thought maybe it was the belt and referred to the manual. No mention of a belt. I called customer service and they told me there was no belt and I would have to take it to their service station 200 miles away. In a last ditch effort, I took it apart. They had lied. There IS a belt, but it was intact. I did a little digging and found out that the vacuum has a chip, that when the roller gets stuck, turns off the roller. Well apparently that chip went out and would cost more to replace than replacing the vacuum. Oh yeah, did I mention this happened right when my six month warranty was up? I have also heard of this happening to a lot of other people too."
1,NOT ENGINEERED FOR HARD-WOOD FLOOR CLEANING!,"When you think of a Eureka product, you would normally think about a high-quality engineered product. NOT IN THIS CASE...!!!The air discharge from the unit blows on the area that your about to clean. This discharge blows dirt & dust all over the place, if, your using it to clean hard-wood floors. After you use this for a period of time, you'll notice that you will have excessive dust build-up on your tables & furniture.Save yourself some money and buy a leaf-blower. It will be much faster and you can use it outdoors!"
2,only good for the hose option,"This is a pretty worthless vacuum. It doesn't have the power to pick up anything heavier than a dust bunny, and even those don't get collected because there is a fan in the front of the vacuum which just blows everything out of the path. I end up running over the same piece of debris (small, as in small down feather / seed / pine needle) over and over and over until I finally just bend over and pick it up. I go over the carpets about 4-5 times before I feel like I might have done some good and stopping. Can't wait to find a new vacuum.It is very light, small, and compact and great for vacuuming stairs with the hose feature. For the price, if you want something small to vacuum the stairs that is portable, then this is the right tool for the job. Otherwise, don't bother."
1,design flaw - exhaust blows in the front,"The exhaust fan blows in the front of the vacuum. On a dusty hard floor, I can see all the dusts flying off right before the vacuum gets there. Air in the room usually gets much more dusty than before vacuuming. Stay away from this product if dusts make you sneeze."
5,Buy this vacuum from Baby Boomer,"I have never had a ""bagless"" vacuum, having always had uprightswith the paper bags, this thing picked up a ton of dirt whenI had just cleaned 3 days before, it has a $15.00 filter insidewhich sucks the dirt into the plastic cannister, my friend at work has one and she says that she doesn't have to dust as much (since those other vacuums put the dirt back into the air, trust me I was skeptical about getting one but I like it, also there is a compartment in the head of it for large items that you might vacuumup so they don't go into the motor and ruin it."
3,"Was great, then both wheels fell off","I really liked this vacuum. That was until today when both of the wheels fell off. A plastic part broke off and it really cannot be fixed. I have only had it for under a year!It has great suction (as long as you keep the filter clean). It is VERY lightweight. It was a bit tough for some of my deeper shag carpeted areas- it was really hard to to move across the carpet. But for wood floors and tile, it was great! The cord is a bit short, so I attached a extension cord so I could go further.I'm going to have to buy another vaccum, but if you need a cheap vaccum for a small house- especially if you have lots of wood floors like I do, this one is good. Just beware of the wheels."
3,"Great, while it worked...","I thought this little thing was the greatest, then, the 'suction' stopped working -- and I took the thing apart to see if by chance there was anything stuck in it-- nope, it simply stopped 'sucking'... I had this about a year and am very disappointed since the last vacuum I had went for years and years."
1,Good At First....,"I have had this vacuum for about 6-8 months now. At first, I loved it! It was small, lightweight and easy for our older sons to use (not that they like vacuuming anymore). My biggest complaint is that you have to empty the canister practically after every use, that is, if you want it to perform at peak. And EWWWWW is it a dusty mess when you go to empty it - I always took it out to the garage straight to the dumpsters - still a dusty MESS!!!!Last night, it completely broke. I got one room and my kitchen done, and when I got to the family room, KERPLUNK! The motor just lost power and suction ceased to exist! :( I know I only paid $60 for this vacuum, so I can't expect gold, but now I'm struggling with what to replace it with - without spending hundreds of dollars on a stupid vacuum cleaner - have I mentioned that I don't like to vacuum? LOL"
4,happy so far!,i read a bunch of reviews on amazon before deciding on this vac - haven't used it too much but i have been really happy so far - yes it is a little hard to push on carpeting but so far it picks up everything. it does a great job on floors as well and i love the no brush setting for doing my throw rugs. very happy so far!!
4,think its the coolest,"this little thing works great. i love the handle--i love how it goes down and gets so short for easy storage. i love the suction--it is great. the only reason that i give it a 4 and not a 5 is because i don't really like that you have to remember not only to turn the button for the brush off after doing carpet and then using the wand attachment, but you also have to turn the floor/hose knob which is down below and its easy to forget that one until you realize that it isn't sucking as well as it was."
1,Aren't vacuum cleaners suppose to suck up dust and not blow it around?,"Well.....there is one major design flaw with this vacuum. Yes, it has strong suction, it is light weight, and versatile.However, there is the fan right above the floor....The vacuum ends up blowing air out of this vent with such force, that all of the dust nearby ends up getting shot into the air. No matter how much suction power this vacuum has, most of the dust gets blown into the air. Definitely not good for us allergy sufferers.Maybe this doesn't seem to be a problem for people who only vacuum carpets.....or maybe they just can't see the dust flying as easily as I can with some wood floors.You would think the designers who created this model would have recognized this huge flaw. I don't recommend this product. Don't waste your money!"
2,very hard to push,I just tried this vacuum for the first time. It does not glide smoothly on my rug and my arm became achy pushing it. It leaves funny track marks as well. I would not recommend it.
1,piece of junk,Do not buy! It just blows the debris around the house when used on hard floors. It just blows the dust or dog hair into the air. This was mentioned in other reviews. The hose does not stay in place. I have been hit in the face by it many times while reaching down to plug in the vaccum. I have had this vaccum for 6 months and the handle will no longer click into place. This is my 4th light weight vaccum and the worst one.
2,No power,"Terrible terrible investment. I bought it because it was on sale for $50 at bed and bath. Plus, it's cute, and I love the color. I should have returned it the first chance I got, but I'd already tossed the box. The suction feature is terrible- it doesn't suction anything, and in many cases, just spits things back out. Everything gets tangled in the brush roll. There's absolutely no power in this vacuum.The bagless canister emptying process is annoying and messy and the hose is too short."
3,Confidence builder for test takers,"For someone that does not have an education degree and needs to take the exam, reading the book will give you some confidence before taking the exam, and this counts for a lot to any exam taker. The book covers a wide range of education topics and written in a reader-friendly style with only one or two typos. However since the topics are so wide, the book cannot cover them all. Only two items from this book came out in the FTCE exam I took. Just use your common sense for what the book does not cover, but does come out in the exam. You'll be surprised how much this works, sure did for me."
5,FTCE General Knowledge,"Awesome. Perfect condition! Book was in mint condition. It came earler then I thought it would arrive.Thanks again, now it is time to get serious and study. It looks hard."
3,Math is a good idea but download DOE english guide,Math was a great review but english was nothing like the actual test. I would recommend this book highly for a math review. For english download the Test Information Guides for FTCE at [...]
3,lots of practice questions but lack of depth in answer explanations,"I used this book in conjunction with another guide to take and subsequently pass my math and reading test. Have still to take my other tests. I found the number of practice tests great, although there were one or two minor typos. The other test prep I used was by Xam and that was more useful to explain why the answers were the answers given. This I found more helpful than the answer explanation in the REA book."
5,I passed using this text!,"I would recommend this. After looking through this text and taking the practice tests, the real test was a breeze. (And you do not want to have to take that test twice.. it is long!)"
2,Awful!,"I would never recommend this as your primary study aid, maybe as back-up to help with the harder math questions. But if you use this as your primary aid, if will intimidate and only make your feel like a loser.BUY THE CLIFF NOTE VERSION!!!! The CN version explains everything step by step whereas I felt this version was way too unorganized and scrambled.Wish me luck because I take the test Thursday!"
3,nothing new,"this film describes what every doc. in the last 20 or years or so has mentioned, so save your $$$ and watch the history channel ."
5,Another modest Phil Dick mind grenade,"Dick is the only author whose works literally force me to put the book down from time to time, for fear that reading one more sentence will send me to the insane asylum forever. Not Stephen King, Clive Barker, or even H.P. Lovecraft can approach the depth of cosmic horror which Dick so modestly invites us to stare into. And yet, there is no pretension here; Dick sympathizes with his innocent protagonists, giving us a straightforward account of their daily struggles to lead normal lives. This is one of the most heartbreakingly hilarious SF novels ever written, with plenty of mind grenades that will detonate in your head long after you've finished the book."
2,Not great but maybe worth reading...,"Ok, it's a PKDick book, so it's full of ideas and nice touches but it's not nearly as good as some of his others. The plot is weak, (as PKD himself admitted) the characters aren't great and some of the dialogue is absolutely cringe-worthy.If you haven't read them I would suggest: Ubik, The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch or Maze of Death instead, they follow similar themes (with less emphasis on the study of schizophrenia) as Martian Time Slip but are much better, more interesting works."
4,The future is near,I like this book for the great ability of the writer to show real what is absurd or fantastic. Dick is a visionary man that write with basic and semplicity events or people allucinant.
2,Ho-Hum,"Like I said, ho-hum. A plodding story about some folks living on a Mars that is very much like, say, the Australian outback. The spacey twist revolves around a character who can see through time and influence it, and the efforts of another to use that power for his own selfish interests. Mildly diverting, but I can't understand how it would motivate another reviewer to run out and buy everything by the author. But then, I've read several other of Dick's novels and I can't say that any of them has lived up to the hype. He's definitely got an interesting outlook, but his writing is just average and frequently incoherent (at least to me). Good luck."
1,uh,"In the beginning there was the book and the book told a story. The story turned out to make the mose infinite and iniminable sense imagineable to everybody who read it. Every story thereafter strove towards the ideal of the infinite and iniminable story but none succeeded. Nevertheless, many of these stories surive to this day for had they not they would have failed to.Philip Dick was disinterested in this idea."
4,an original,"The Characters in this book, particularly the autistic boy whose favorite expression is ""gubble gubble"" are the basis for the 2012 television show 'Touch'. Once more PKD is the source of a modern sci-fi film work. Unfortunately he wasn't credited this time."
4,Interesting Novel Of Ideas,"Suspension of disbelief is necessary when reading science fiction - it took a lot for this one. Canals on mars, the odd and inaccurate descriptions of various mental illnesses, etc. But that isn't the point - Philip K Dicks' are novels of ideas and this one is about time travel and more importantly the concept of arriving at truth via mental illness. Very interesting."
5,Precious Moments Collector's Guide is GREAT!,"I have found this collector's guide to be a valuable resource in determining the value of my Precious Moments collection and that of a friend. It is very well researched, put together well, and has great photos for better identification of PM collectables."
4,Just wait until the new one is released,"With all the new pieces and new symbols, you might as well just wait until the new one comes out on April 15, 2006.It's an excellent book because the book is extremely easy to navigate to find what you have, it tells you the stories behind some of the pieces, and it tells you how much everything is worth.The only reason I'm not giving this book 5 stars is because not all of the symbols are given, as the book needs updated."
1,incomplete book,Pages 32-62 were never inserted by the publisher. The merchant was notified and my money was refunded immediately
5,12 STEPS,I like it!I don't have 13 words to say & I don't see why its mandatory to have a lot to say about MY purchases ~ either I like it or don't like it ~ why do I have to write a book? why don't you simply put a brief description in the headliner or summary ~ you should be trying to make it easier for clients to want to leave feedback ~ this is to much work!
3,"No, no, no....","I rated this book 3 stars because I actually did like it in spite of the awful writing and weak content. If you're college educated or have ever had a chemistry or nutrition class in your life you are not going to be able to accept a lot of the silly things the author writes, like strange wives tales or something wrongly presented as fact. But otherwise, I found this book very encouraging in the quest for a healthier and raw diet."
2,"Flawed, She Is Wrong","Read ""Eat To Live"" and you will see why. Certain vegetables are assimilated better when they are steamed. Raw foodists have presented with hair loss, anemia, and all kinds of health issues. I agree with being a vegan, but you need some steamed vegetables and a baked potato is good sometimes. The author gained back 60 lbs because of food cravings. 100% raw is not the way to go."
2,Too religious....,"This book has more to do with the authors believs then with ""facts"" and expierences.Id recommend something more professional especially for people that want to start eating raw."
2,BE WARNED!,"This book is a very strange read. It is emotional and unscientific to such a degree that it is hard to describe. Outrageous claims are made with no explanation or scientific backing what so ever. A quick look at a random page reveals her weird thinking: ""if we follow our heart and do what we are meant to do with this life, then we become dedicated spiritual beings, and we can be granted an extra portion of energy from the universe.""It is very tiring to look for useful information in between all the ""crazy stuff"". I still did, and even though I found most of the book to be utterly useless, there were a couple of interesting anecdotes on how trusting your taste buds might lead you to the foods you need, and a few other interesting points. Whether they are worth reading the book for, I am not sure."
2,Not the Best Raw Food Book,"I found this book to have some useful information, but don't recommend it. 'Facts' are presented without any outside references and the writing is somewhat stilted. I highly recommend The Sunfood Diet Healing System as a truly comprehensive book on raw foodism."
2,Not what I was looking for at all.,"I admit it, the title ""12 steps to Raw foods"" should have given away that this book is just a rehash of the 12 steps program.What I expected was an actual 12 step program to familiarizing myself with raw food, and processes, and grocery lists. This is not a book to get if you are just starting to learn about raw foodism.This book is so subjective it kind of turned me off from the raw movement. It's a little creepy actually. It's purely anecdotes of the author's personal experience. I showed this book to some friends who eat vegan, and some who eat raw, and they suggested some better books.Living Cuisine by Renee UnderkofflerAnything by Steve Meyerowitz, Ann Wigmore, etc."
3,"Good, but I have read better","This book is good to help ween you off of cooked food, but it does not provide a lot of recipes. I would reccomend any books by Shazzie, such as Detox Delights."
4,RAW food in plain english...,"Ok...she does get on the soapbox and kind of claims its a cure all, but I've seen Raw Food Diets do SO much for people I can understand her boast. I read another person's post here and I just wanted to say that they misqouated the book entirely and they OBVIOUSLY DID NOT read the book in debt. I imagine they skimmed the book becuase it wasn't even FACTUAL. I however, am only half way through the book and I love it. The receipies are a God-sent. A ""burger"" without the use of a DEHYRDATOR!!! I love it. I'm an ADDICT! She also speaks in a termanolgy that I was able to go back to my children and explain to them why those oreo cookies are ""toxic"". They understood and now they are excited. This helps you let other understand why you would do something so drastic. You'll still get some critisim. But if you have ever read the Blood Type Diet her reasoning will make perfect sense to you. Among other things."
3,Round robin quilting,"Good ideas on preparing to start a Round Robin Quilt activity (especially in a guild, etc.). Many suggestions - a lot of valuable ideas on the subject."
5,Excellent Resource,"If you ever wondered about 'Round Robin Quilts', this is an excellent reference book with beautiful examples of the many varieties to 'Round Robin Quilting'. The instructions and patterns are first rate and easy to understand for novice to advanced quilter. First time quilters may need some additional assistance with some of the ideas and patterns, but, they too could be very successful using this book. Round Robin Quilts are a LOT of fun!"
3,Decent psychedelic compilation,"Like many of the CD compilations in this genre, this CD gives a fair collection of mostly common songs with few unique gems. A good starting point for those who have limited knowledge of psychedelic music. Poorly represents British psychedelic music."
5,Great Trip-Hop Music...,"This album is one that I have enjoyed for years, and I am glad to see that it is still available since my copy has been ""borrowed"" for a friend for quite a while.Great driving, relaxing, tripping, smoking, or plain just-hanging-out at home music!"
4,Good for the money & does everthing well,"I purchased this unit for $399 about a week ago after returning a defective Yamaha 2700 which was double the $$. I've never owned a Onkyo (always denon or Yamaha) but I wanted to give Onkyo a try after all the good reviews and I needed a reciever my wife could figure out without having to read the manual. I can say that I am happy with the purchase! The unit does everthing well and is easy to use/ set up. I cannot rate it a 5 because I'm use to higher end equipment with more features/adjustments and the video pic is not as good. Also, three big complaints: runs VERY HOT. I wish the unit had a SAT/CBL label/button instead of one of the ""video 1,2,3"". Cannot get OSD (ie. volume) to show on the tv thru HDMI connections (only OSD menu)."
2,Didn't work for me,"I had the exact same experience as one of the reviewers below. Hooked up several different video sources and ran and HDMI cable to my Pioneer plasma television. The first problem I had was an annoying hum from all speakers. After trying many debug options I finally debugged it to the HDMI connection. With HDMI connected (several different cables) the hum was there, without it no hum. In addition I had the same video problem listed before as well. There was a scrolling line that went slowly up the screen with all video sources. So I tried to set everything up removing the HDMI cable and just running component video to the plasma. While the sound was now very good it still had that annoying scroll line on all video sources. Given that I had to return it. I just got a Yamaha 661 and am happy with it so far but I had to give up the dream of one HDMI cable to the plasma, too bad."
3,"Great Sound, outdated interface","Great sound and up-converting features... for the price, I expected better on screen menus and an overall better user interface. In this modern day customers should expect an exceptional experience from their electronics equipment: here the sound is AWESOME, but centering an entire home theater around this _may_ be uninspiring. Another pet peave: when selecting an audio - only source (Tuner) the video from the previously selected video source remains on screen - granted - if you are listening to an audio only source, you would typically turn off the tv, I just thought it would have been better to provide a nice on-screen interface to the audio tuner instead of showing another video source unrelated to the audio you are listening to."
2,Sent incomplete; quit responding to e-mails,"The receiver arrived late, after my email question reminded seller to ship. Arrived with no remote and no setup microphone. Reciever works great."
1,Snap Crackle POP,"Unfortunately my receiver showed up with ungrounded rca's, so my speakers sounded akin to the breakfast cereal. Though the optical worked perfectly. So when I played a cd I could hear why it is a highly ranked receiver. I tryied to get a replacement but amazon was out of them and only offered a refund. So, a great deal that ended badly."
4,Not Quite What I Expected.,"The sound quality from this unit is great.The 2 HDMI inputs are nice, although one more would have been ideal.However, the one drawback to the unit is that, when switching Cable channels, the receiver frequently goes into a mode ""Setting up HDMI image"" which causes a several seconds delay. This is very annoying when watching football games or other sporting events."
4,Great Unit for the Price,"I recently upgraded to the Onkyo TX-SR674 replacing a 8 year old entry level Harmon Kardon Unit. I felt that the overall features for the price on the 674 could not be beat. Setup was pretty easy. My only complaints are that it seems like it has a little trouble autodetecting which surround sound mode to go into when watching TV, especially when changing from a program to a commercial and when there is a delay between the sound and the video when it is turned on initally. (I have my ps3 hooked up to it and when I turn on an EA sports game you only hear the A, not the E, because of the delay). I also feel the sound quality is not as rich as my old Harmon Kardon. These are minor complaints. Overall it is an excellent value for the money."
4,Almost perfect!,"The *only* thing I would add to this to make it a perfect scoring product would be to include HD Radio capability. Very happy with the upscaling, and is easy to set up. Highly recommended."
4,Awesome Receiver,"I really like this receiver and it's my third one, my first one was a Denon, lasted about 2 years, then I bought a panasonic, that lasted a year, I was ready to by a Sony when I read that this Onkyo is a good receiver and the pricing is pretty good too. I like the auto speaker set up to help your configure the speakers to be more adaptable to your room. The only draw back is the FM Tuner, it states it has an internal FM tuner, picks up nothing, it came with an antenna but I can't find the hook up in the back, the only thing I see is for AM, maybe someone can help me with this one. All and all it's a good receiver especially the 2 HDMI inputs"
5,"creative, and something different the whole family can enjoy","awesome, a must for anybody in the punk scene, alternative scene, and a steal at just over 10 bucks, this is one hard cd to find, and they only have usually one, so buy it before it's gone."
4,Mother of Punk!,"This album by Miss Hagen is one of her earlier releases right before she went mainstream (for her) with Fearless and Ekstacy. This album has a more raw punk feel to it and not as electronic dance as her follow up albums....I would say it is her transition album...from early punk to 80s new wave dance...this one is the in between sound....i recomend it highly as it has a punk/new wave sound but you can hear the begginings of a new sound starting to bubble up from her warped, talented, brain!!! Love her and love this album!"
5,Nina Hagen? Who is that?,"New to Nina? Interested about her sound? This is the right album to purchase. Nina Hagen's ""Nunsexmonkrock"" is by far my favorite album of Nina's. Every song brings that unique East-Berlin flair of a true 80's marvel. While other albums like ""In Ecstasy"" has good tracks, the overall sound is almost too ""Pop"" to be that underground New Age. ""Nunsexmonkrock"" is like a transcendental work of art, with eerie synthesized sounds and an incredible vocal range. Nina can be both gravelly and operatic in the same track, which is a large part of her appeal. Her erratic manner is alluring and special, but may not be everyone's cup of tea. So if you want to get a feel for Ms. Hagen, try ""Nunsexmonkrock"", and take it from me, she is worth a second listen!"
3,Soundtrack to the lives of the truly disturbed.,"If you're reading this, you're probably a bit touched. I can't imagine a well-adjusted human being having enough interest in Nina Hagen to read her Amazon.com review. (And I'm reviewing the damn thing; I'm calling my therapist as soon as I post this.) So if the average eclectic thinks you're a bit strange, I'm guessing this will be right up your alley. Frankly, I can't tolerate listening to the entire CD in one listen; it's just too much of . . . something. In small doses, however, Hagen is wonderful. My personal favorite is ""Born in Xixax"", with Hagen performing her vocal gymnastics to great cold-war era lyrics. How many vocalists can name-drop Leonid Brezhnev and make it funky?"
4,Produced a definite difference in softness and appearance of my skin. I am anxious to see if product continues improving.,Organics C improved texture of my skin. The application produced just the right amount without waste. I intend to repeat my orderd.
5,Great Serum!,"I am over 50 and I struggled with acne as a teen and as a young adult. After researching the affects Vitamin C has on our skin, I purchased Organics C for Yourself. I use it in conjunction with Oh What a Night cream by Nature's Gate. I can tell a difference in the texture of my skin after 3 weeks of using these products. I also have a PMD that I use once every 7 days so I have my on skin spa treatment in the comfort of my home."
5,Great facial serum!,I love the whole line of Nature's Gate Organics skin care. I was not familiar with facial serums before winning $100 worth of this skin care. I love the natural light fragrances! This serum works great as an addition to their moisturizers.
3,"Fun, too pricy","One of these dolls is sitting on a shelf in a common area at work and I have been having fun with it. I was thinking about getting one for my wife, as I think she would love it. But $60??? Way too much."
4,"A little dated, but practical and a classic.",A bit behind the times in terms of equipment. Way ahead of its time in terms of practicality and useful knowledge that can still be applied today.
5,To another level of ability,"Aspiring skiers will love this DVD. The instructors explain fundamental skills and demonstrate techniques using step-by-step progressions. I found myself drawn to easily glide into an invigorating sport with this DVD. True experts show the audience how to ski from a skier's first day out and mentor skiers all the way through the advanced skills. I more recently picked up their new ""Nordic Skiing Technique DVD"" on Amazon.com and it brings the technical content to yet another level!"
2,Disappointing,"Unlimited Clean Oxygen Fed Sport (Nordic Skiing)?You gotta be kidding! The second half the first DVD focused on a few athletes in summer triathalons. Fine. But what happened to Nordic Skiing? A bit self-aggrandizing if you ask me. The DVD started out cool - but really went downhill quickly - absolutely no pun intended.The instructional DVD was bad. Awkward format suited to a PC and not to a DVD player as it forced you to return to ""main menu"" after each lesson. I bailed early on.Where is the DVD with exhilarating oxygen fed nordic skiing? This is not it. Sorry.I am planning on returning it"
5,WOW! What a great CD!,I'm not a big fan of this genre but I have to say... this CD really 'moved' me! I'd recommend this to anyone and everyone.
1,Not so Super,"Despite the negative reviews here, I was hopeful, but Superpower isn't worth the jewel case it's shipped in. Nuff said.However, both Supreme Ruler 2010 and the newer and pricier 2020 are Superpower to the 10th power. Both are awesome, with great support from developer Battlegoat and an active online community."
4,Great western short stories,L'Amour's short stories are just the right length when looking for a great short read. They are great on action but short on character.
4,Good introduction to Louis L'Amour,"This book makes a good introduction of the works of Louis L'Amour, even if it is the second volumn of his work. There are so many stories and when you want to read a few at a time you can, then set aside to come back to later without missing anything. I would recommend this as a look into western themes and the stories of Rangers, etc. that inhabit our cowboy movies and television programs of times past."
5,I love these stories,I have only begun reading Louis L'Amour in the last year. I find these short Western stories to be a joy to read.
1,Loud and not funny!,Whitney is soo loud and the jokes are not funny. Not worth the time and most of the jokes are too old.
1,No thanks...,"This was painfully, brutal...ugh...I couldn't stop playback fast enough...Pretty disappointing, because I actually think her tv show is ok...oh well!"
4,So funny!,"I don't understand all the negativity surrounding Whitney, she has some great line! Her show is hilarious as well. Maybe it is just because I am female, but I think she is talented, and this is great!"
1,"Terrible, terrible, terrible",Not funny at all. I watched the first 10 minutes and didn't laugh once. What a waste. I want my 10 minutes back
1,This was free and I still want a refund.,"This is just as good as her tv show, which is painful to watch. When you call this comedy...you have to use quotations. ""comedy"""
4,"Funny, raunchy, but not gross.","I thought this lady was funny. She did not hold back on some pretty raunchy stuff, but she didn't seem to be trying to gross the audience out. She is attractive, sort of like Sandra Bullock, who protests way too much way about her looks. Compared to well known male stand-up comedians, her brand of raunch is mild. I would like to see her again and see if she could do some political humor, or something other than ""relationships"" between the sexes."
4,Worth watching!,"I don't typically write reviews but this rating compelled me to do so. I can't believe this only has a 2 1/2 star rating. I read some of the other comments about her jokes lacking originality. Ok, some of the jokes have been done before but there's a good amount of content that she makes her own. I stand behind the statement that Whitney Cummings is a very funny comedian."
1,Whitney,"I was force-fed this mediocre wretch of a comedian on ""Chelsea Lately"" (a show I grew to loathe over time and do not watch any longer). I didn't like her then, like her even less now. Over-exposed (with a TV show of her own on NBC), unoriginal, pedantic, boring, loud, un-funny and lame. The polar opposite of several accomplished female comedians such as Lisa Lampinelli. Lynne Koplitz, Maria Bamford and Jackie Kashian. Proof that mediocrity continues to reign in this day and age.Whitney Cummings: Money Shot"
2,Not funny when it's been done before but better!,"The jokes have been done before, only better. She feels the need to cuss and be vulgar to gain a larger male audience but really all you need to do is be funny and original."
2,Too much yelling not enough humor,"I saw her live a few years ago in LA and she was pretty funny. I thought her Joan Rivers roast was great but she's bombed since then. This comedy special is definitely on the side of not very funny. Her act is mostly yelled at you and her presentation just seems off. Then again, if you're one of those people who finds her TV show funny then maybe this is for you."
1,This passes for comedy?,"I can't imagine how this woman ever moved past ""open mike night"" at the local club. Is it because she's pretty (not gorgeous, not ""hot,"" just pretty)? Is it because she yells and calls the audience ""bitches""? Is this what passes for comedy in the internet age? Please don't tell me it's what passes for talent."
1,Help!,"She's cute, but this is just not funny. I didn't laugh at all, the jokes are lame. I did try to laugh, but it just couldn't happen. Sorry, Whitney, time to get another job."
1,Couldn't get past the first 15 minutes,"This was horrible. I don't know if it got any better but I wasn't going to try to find out. A good comedian will at least set you up with a few good jokes in the beginning just to get you in the mood. This lady proves she couldn't get a person in the mood unless it was a very short term relationship, which I kept it at.Not really funny... at all."
2,"amusing, not hilarious","I decided to watch this after seeing her on Jimmy Fallon plugging her new show. She seemed funny during her interview but I was disappointed with this performance. Her comedy often comes across as mocking and bitter. Her spiteful humor centers almost exclusively on relationships. As others mention, there are not a lot of original jokes, and none that are laugh out loud. It is amusing, and she certainly puts a lot of energy and effort into the material but fails to deliver innovative and laugh out loud comedy."
1,Instantly annoying,Some dumb lady from DC with a microphone. Not funny at all. Screechy voice and talks like somebody from Washington DC.
1,NOT,Don't waste your time. Dreadful and abrasive. Not funny. Probably the worst comedy ever. Raspy and loud. Rent almost anything else.
1,Absolutely terrible!,"A little background on why I decided to watch this:I've seen Whitney Cummings on the show ""Whitney"" and I thought that show was pretty good. I generally like actors/actresses' standup better than their characters on any shows.Originality aside, right from the start the jokes were crude and patronizing toward men. I thought this was just the first side to her show and at the second half she would point out women's insecurities in an equally condescending fashion, however that never happened. The show never got better and at the end all I can do now is blur it altogether as one giant man hating rant.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone looking for a good laugh.Conversely, I would recommend this to any women who just had a bad breakup."
4,Pretty good,Allot like her NBC show and you can see why the show is so funny because she's playing herself. Pretty good.
2,Headache,"WHY IS SHE YELLING? Holy crap, my head is pounding.Also, not funny. I didn't really laugh at all. A couple of forced giggles every so often, but that's it. Where's the tylenol?"
2,Meh,"I found myself thinking, ""Where have I heard that joke before?"" several times throughout Whitney's performance.Her delivery is mediocre, the jokes are mediocre, and I just didn't enjoy it.I don't think I'm a part of her target audience, though, as a male mid 20something."
3,Just O.K.,"The first 8 or 9 minutes was just a bunch ""guy bashing"" which wasn't even funny. But after that it was alright...not terrible, but not great. She had only a couple of good lines."
4,Worth watching...,"I did find myself asking, ""why is she yelling so much?"". But still worth watching for the jokes. If you prefer puppet shows, like an earlier reviewer pointed out, you might not like her. She's filthy, mean, but hilarious."
3,jokes are still jokes,"Good to watch, I wouldn't buy the dvd. But its not bad to watch. There are definitely better clips of Whitney and a lot better stand comedians to watch. If you have to kill an hour of time - watch it. If you are looking for something REALLY funny to enjoy your evening - then I would pass."
1,Fran Dresher minus the pleasant voice.,"I made it twenty minutes in before stopping to review this. This chick represents her hometown well. DC also generates nothing but poorly delivered, re-hashed drivel."
1,Ugh,"I think she yells too much. I just have no idea how she can yell through the ENTIRE special and not have something wrong with her voice. And her jokes aren't too good either. For most of her act, she has ok jokes but really bad delivery but sometimes it's just all bad. Like a high school joke that someone who isn't your friend would think is extremely stupid and immature."
2,Not all that funny.,"FULL DISCLOSURE: I only made it about 13 minutes in.She telegraphs her punchlines, so you already know what they are before she gets to them. Delivery has no personality. It's like SIRI telling jokes up there. Watch the trailer. If you like the trailer, you'll like the whole routine."
1,"Seriously, why is she yelling at me?","Only made it through the first 10 minutes of this, and I'm glad I decided to quit.Her voice is obnoxious, she yells, just terrible. The comedy Defensive Driving class I went to had better material than this. Very glad I didn't actually pay for this (free with Amazon Prime)."
1,Whoa! Amazingly BAD,"I got through 5 minutes and had to turn it off. Just really crummy comedy. She forces expletives and sensational language about anatomy to cover up her complete lack of comedic talent. Isn't the whole world tired of penis jokes and the word ""vagina?"" It's like a perpetual re-run. This video might be free, but unless you live under a rock, you won't be able to afford this travesty. What junk."
1,A Slow Train Wreck,"A slow train wreck would have to be less painful than this awful ""comedy"" It should be removed immediately due to the annoying shrill of her voice and the recycled not funny jokes"
1,Lots of vulgarity,"She only knows how to cuss and be gross, but doesn't know how to make amusing. Not funny at all."
1,Tired old jokes trotted out once more for mediocre laughs.,"Whitney Cummings takes comedy in new and interesting directions, exploring topics like the differences between men and women, how much she hates morning sex, and her deep hatred of wrinkly scrotal skin.Oh wait... none of that is new, original or funny.She is a shrill fetid boil on the ass of American comedy."
1,Peurile Vulgarity,"Even if it were possible to get by the screechy voice (it's not), this performance is incredibly bad. Adolescent raunch delivered without wit, style or charm."
1,just isnt that funny,"i watched about half of this, i dont think she's terrible its just that it was very easy to see where she was going with a joke, you can tell what the punchline is going to be once she brings up a topic, all of her jokes were very obvious"
1,5 minutes,Thats as long as I could stand listening to her. She stands there and laughs at her own jokes and is very annoying.
1,Awful.,"This video is far from funny. It is actually quite awful. And she really needs to stop yelling. Even though it's free for Prime Members, skip it."
1,Predictable and ordinary,"TRUE I only got to the third minute or so, but it was just so, I dunno, ordinary. ""hey, wanna know the difference between the sexes? let me run down the most stereo typical things I can think of..."" Not smart, scarcely amusing. I woulda been pissed if I paid for it. Love my Amazon Prime."
1,Nothing new. boring.,"Wow. Could not even make it 30 seconds. Very dry and boring. Expected more, but disappointed. Ok... it was awful and I cannot even come up with 20 words to explain."
1,grating and crude,"I was actually surprised at how bad Whitney's act was. I figured someone who managed to get a TV show had to have some basic chops. Unfortunately that isn't true, as her material is surprisingly unsophisticated and dated. Male bashing seems to be her only theme, and in very predictable and unsurprising ways. She also has an annoying habit of thinking that she is pretty funny, and halfway through each joke, she seems to be preparing herself to hear your laughter. Her nasal voice had me turning off after 15-20 minutes, just couldn't stand it any more."
1,Trying to hard,"Boring, unoriginal, and trying too hard. You can easily see the punch line coming before she ever finishes a joke."
1,Sucks!,"I read a couple reviews and held my breath, it was so bad, I actually took time out of my day to write this review. Do yourself a favor and skip over Whitney Cummings money shot"
1,annoying,"a must not watch, waste of time. too much yelling, horrible/boring jokes. I bet people just got out of their seats and walked out.I feel bad for the people who paid to see her perform."
4,good laughs,"Funny, rowdy, good standup from a chick point of view. What the heck are all these jerks yapping about and writing one star ratings for??? If you don't like the first five minutes of a video, turn it the heck off, and go find a Golden Girls rerun, or something else more your speed."
5,AMAZING,I don't know why everyone is hating on this video. Whitney is HILARIOUS. She pretty much describes half the woman I know perfectly. I loved this. Entertaining and totally true.
4,Much better than the negative reviews,"She's an observational comic. True, her voice is annoying and the first few seconds when she's warming up the crowd seems a little like amateur hour but you quickly forget about that. Her jokes are good, and some are brilliant. A good one to watch with your significant other. What great comics do is offer a new perspective which somehow helps your understanding of the opposite sex. Definitely worth your 48 minutes."
3,Magnetiser Demagnetiser.,"The rating would be higher for this if there were instructions for it. I went of the web and found some pretty easily though. This works well for magnetsing screwdrivers, allens, etc. Demagnetising requires frequent testing during the process, but I don't know why you would want to do it. Magnetising holds pretty well and is strong enough to hold a screw and insert it if you aren't to jittery (not as strong as magnetic bit holders for quarter inch hex drive bits)."
5,magnetize/demagnetize tool,It's a strong tool and works as described very well on small items. It takes up very little space in my tool box.
3,No instructions,I guess I am an idiot but this came with no instructions so I have no idea how to use it. I will have to google it to figure it out and have not done it yet. My first attempt produced no results and given the other reviews I think I am doing it wrong. I suspect it works but some brief instructions would be nice.
2,ok - but rate it as below average,"I needed another magnetizer, as the one I have is over 20 years old and I lost half of it - there was a rubber band type attachment holding the two pieces together. I bought this hoping it would be better then the half of the 20 year old metal one - I was disappointed. It works, but not as good as the half of the 20 year old one. I wonder if I removed the green casing, it might magnetize better, or maybe the green casing is holding it together, so removing the green might break it. Overall, it is ok - but I would give it a below average rating. It is good for small metal screws, but will only slightly magnetize a medium screwdriver. What bug me about this one is that it worse then the 20 year old piece I am still using. Wish I could find the other half, if I did not discard it. And, yes it would be nice to have some directions as to what the right side steps are for. They could have put some directions on the back of the package or a small insert."
2,Didn't Work For Me,I tried to use this on some drill bits for a small drill I have. It simply would not magnetize the bits. Maybe you will have better luck than I did but it didn't work for me.
4,"Useful, yet without instructions.","Regarding documentation, this may be obvious to some and Wiha apparently assumes so as there absolutely no instructions included on how to magnetize and/or demagentize. The first isn't that hard to do as almost any exposure to a magnet will make a tool magnetic (provided the steel supports it). The achievable strength depends on the screwdriver material and is relatively moderate, but that's to be expected and it's still useful. Demagnetizing is a different ball game as the purpose of the steps in the tool is undocumented and in my trials it was easy to get a good magnetic property in my Wiha screwdrivers. However, so far I've not been successful to remove the magnetism from the drivers."
4,great item for auto and other uses,"I am an automotive enthusiast and this item nicely magnetizes smaller screws, bolts and tools. I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of pickup power my non-magnetic screw driver had. I recommend this item!"
2,Tough to read,"Pretty good watch, but not so good bang-for-buck: 1)not enough countdown time (only 99 min...need 24 hours 2)you must have 18-year old eyes to read bezel computer 3)function buttons opposite from most watches, so I'm constantly pushing the wrong one, and biggest problem...3)you can't read the digital display unless the lighting is perfect (backlight button works OK, but when you push it, it effects the functions...that's just wrong). This watch, even at half retail price, is too expensive. Should have returned it."
3,"Good head, slippery handle","I work with a travelling circus and this is a great all purpose sledgehammer for driving stakes and setting up tents and securing the tiger run lines. My only complaint is that the hickory handle gets a little slippery when wet. I recommend this sledgehammer but make sure that you apply plenty of tape or adhesive material on the handle, or make sure you NEVER USE IT IN THE RAIN!!!!"
2,just didn't like movie,Through no fault of anyone I just didn't like this movie. I thought it was very slow. I don't even think I finished it.
3,Ju-on,This was a good film for those who like Japanese horror. The down side is the movie wasn't as scary as one might thought it would be.
4,An acquired taste is needed to like this movie,"I read many of the reviews for this movie, and after reading them, decide I wanted to post my own. Some people loved it, others hated it. Personally, I found this movie to be very scary, and not in the typical horror movie way. It wasn't overly gory or anything like that, but it was psychologically disturbing. (At least for me) For the first time since I was a kid, after watching this movie, I actually had to sleep with the TV on. For me, that determined it's ""scariness"" factor. The jumping time line is also something that was mentioned a lot. I'll admit, it's not the easiest thing to follow, but I really enjoy having to put elements in a movie together on my own (which is why I'm still toiling over Donnie Darko). If you want a movie with ""no assembly required"", then this movie isn't for you. If you don't mind taking out the mental screwdrivers and putting it together on your own, then I think you'd love this movie."
5,Scary as all hell!,"Simply put, this first theatrical (and third film in the 'Ju On' series) is the stuff of nightmares. There is imagery here that will keep you awake for weeks.It's arguably the weakest film in the series...but it still delivers scares the likes of which U.S. audiences have never seen before. I hope Lion's Gate puts out the other three 'Ju On' films soon."
2,Huh? Whats on tv ...,"FORGET THIS MOVIE... It is boring, actually enjoyed the US version a little more.Try A TALE OF TWO SISTERS instead. Infinitely better."
1,Your kidding right?,"This movie is not scary, it is not good, and it does not make sense. I have not seen the Grudge, I do not need to. This flick is so cliched and lame that it was more funny than scary. Anyone who tries telling/acting like they get it and it scared them are morons. From the first ""name"" to the last they all die the same way, oohhh gray person with black, scary eyes...oooohhhh, scary. And they don't need to be in or have lived in the house to get it either (I thought that was the whole premise of the film). I am so mad I wasted an hour and half watching this thing, don't be like me."
1,Talcum powder is not scary,"This is one of the crappiest movies I have ever seen. To think that a little boy dipped in talcum powder with a bit of eye liner and mascara would be scary....well...I think NOT!! The entire plot is repetitive and boring and by the end of it, you are just waiting and wanting everyone to die because they are all just so lame. The only highlight of the show is the end credits because you can finally turn the tele off. The film works more as a sedative than an adrenalin rush. I give it the big THUMBS DOWN!!!"
3,"Good imagery, disjointed story","While there were scary moments and some great J-horror imagery in Ju-on, the lack of a main character really hurt the movie. I felt like I was watching a series of short films with the same ending. It would have been much more frightening and suspenseful with a few long-term main characters.Something interesting I found out after the movie was that one of the spooky apparitions is most likely related to a Japanese spirit called a rokurokubi -- an evil female spirit with an extendable neck. The image was a bit confusing (I wasn't sure exactly why it was supposed to be scary), and finding out that it had a place in Japanese mythology really helped.Mostly because of the film's choppy construction, I would skip Ju-on and see Ringu or Face instead."
1,Wrong version of Ju-on,"There are two versions to the film Ju-on. The one I was looking for was the original version called ""Ju-on: The Curse"", which scared me so badly I still don't go in the attic alone. This version I'm reviewing (and which falsely came up under a search for The Curse) is called ""Ju-on: The Grudge"", which was the director's immediate remake of his terrifying film. It seems he didn't think American audiences could handle or understand the original version so he came up with this campy horror film that's not even as scary as the American ""The Grudge""."
4,"Awesome film, likely to give you nightmares!","What's it about?Home-care worker Rika gets a job minding an old woman in a house which seems routine. Rika's underwear takes a ride to brown town when a ghostly boy emerges upstairs and routine takes a back-seat. This house and the spirits that dwell within hold a grudge against anybody foolish enough to infringe.Is it any good?A masterpiece in J-Horror; Takashi's `The Grudge' is a pulse pounding ride on a ghost train. It scores big with it's slow pacing, building tension one scary scene after another, holding on to our fears and not letting go. Great sound effects, spooky atmosphere and plenty of psychological pressure; just ignore the weak American remake.Best bit?Kayako's horrifying descent down the stairs; those sound effects are so memorable.Did you know?The strange vocal sounds were performed by director Shimizo Takashi."
2,Confusing,"I watched the trailer for this movie and was very excited to watch it, but ended up disappointed with it. The movie manages to give you the chills with some creepy images several times during the movie, but it would have been better if I didn't have to stop and rewatch previously watched scenes repeatedly just to make sense out of what I was watching. As for the little half naked and apparently also half cat ghost boy that looked like he took a bath in talcum powder, he was not very scary.P.S.Meow"
3,A Mixture Of Scary and Confusing...,"This movie is hard to speak on. After I watched this movie I myself was wondering what to think of it. In some parts of the film I was scratching my head and other times I was nodding my head in satisfaction of a good scary part they threw in there a few times. As I have said in my title I had mixed feelings throughout the entire film. This film gives off a good scare in some parts and then leaves you confused in other parts. I give this a solid three because that's how I feel about this film- not great, but not terrible either. I ask myself if this confusion was because of the fact I was constantly comparing it to the American version which isn't a good idea- for Ju- On is pretty different from the American version and that's probably a good reason why many of us experienced confusion because we were comparing the two. But the film was a good scare like the American version was so I give both a solid three."
2,Below Average,"Yes, I'll admit that I would jump if a black cat came out at me in the dark, and I would also get freaked out if a kid passes by running and I keep hearing his little never-ending footsteps. However, I really think the movie sucked. Where is the storyline? Why is the acting so bad? I didn't expect Oscar-worthy material, but it would've been good to at least watch something that made you say...""not too bad""."
1,MOVIE IS IN JAPANEESE!!!! DON'T RENT!!!,"MOVIE IS IN JAPANEESE!!!! DON'T RENT!!!$2 wasted, but I will call Amazon for a refund tomorrow, what a dumb situation. How could I know it's in japaneese..."
1,Just foolish,"I heard this movie was scary so I bought it. What a waste of $20! It's silly for the most part and even though there are one or two parts that are a bit scary, the movie is just more boring than anything else.I thought The Ring was scary, The Grudge is just similar ideas rehashed."
3,Seen Ringu?,"This movie is not scary. It offers some suspense that gets monotonous after a short while. There were instances that were startling, though they had potential to be more so. The supposedly scary characters look too realistic and I hear (and have seen in previews) that these same characters are done better in the American version... which brings me to the Ring and Ringu: if you've seen those two then you will understand when i say that The Grudge japanese version is to its american version as ringu is to the ring. In both cases american version is scarier and done better overall. Plus if you watch this first part you would pretty much half to watch the other parts (grudge 2, the curse, etc...) as this does not explain much or wrap things up."
5,Now more than ever,"With terrorism being the current excuse to freeze accounts of people who later turn out to be innocent, offshore asset protection becomes important to everyone - and perhaps more so if you are an immigrant with significant assets and living in the U.S.What I really liked about this book was that it was direct and practical - and the publisher even provided a free offshore trust with an offshore brokerage account included. I didn't have to spend lots of time trying to pursue generic advice."
3,Travel adapter,"It is a good product but overpriced. Most manufacturers today provide universal voltage (115-240 VAC) power adaptors for which you can buy an inexpensive adaptor to convert the american type prongs to the overseas one. Palm, instead, provides the adaptor for 115 VAC only for the Z22 model. In that way, they force you to buy the one they make for international travel."
4,Crazy fun,"This is a wonderful tale of the absurd and the fantastic. Peter Schlemiel is a young man who trades his shadow for a bag of gold coins which never gets empty of them. But, no one must notice his lacking a shadow. Those who do, despise him and get away. Peter goes to a resort and falls in love with a girl , but the wedding is impossible because she notices he doesn't have a shadow. Then he meets again the man who traded the bag of gold for his shadow, and Peter asks it back. The man agrees, but in exchange he must give him his soul. Peter refuses and throws the bag to an abyss. Then he finds the seven-leagues boots, wears them and runs to the Thebaid, in Greece. This is pure fun on crazy and absurd adventures. Very pleasant reading."
3,The Man Who Sold His Shadow,"I picked this up when reading that Calvino was a fan of this work. Written in 1814, this slim novel packs a punch in much the same way as the tales of Hoffmann. As an author who never felt that he belonged (born in France, living in Prussia), this tale speaks to the period of the Franco-Priussian War. A good read for fans of the magical parable. Some nice illustrations from Harold Wortsman (I assume related to the transaltor Peter Wortsman)."
3,"A bit bland, and crumbly","[...]Almondina Almond Cookies, Gingerspice, 4-Ounce Package (Pack of 7)Arrived a bit broken up--they don't travel well! Taste a bit bland, but somewhat addicting for the sugar-sensitive in need of a sweet hit. I think these are biscotti sliced before baking to get the slender cookie shape. I think they might be better left in biscotti shape and just made smaller than a normal biscotti to reduce the calorie count and keep them intact and shippable."
1,Overpriced,"Typically overpriced for an OOP CD. Do what I did,buy an LP for $4.00 and make your own CD."
2,Loved it when it worked,"I had this machine for about 6 months and used it for making so many different wonderful types of pasta. It was actually fun to use and I was impressed with the quality and taste of the pasta. I used liquids such as champagne to make delicious fresh pasta that I even gave as gifts.Then...the machine cracked. The circular piece on the machine that held the extrusion die in place broke but the worst of it was that I could NOT contact the company for a replacement. I called week after week hunting down any number I could find for them to no avail. No one ever answered and I could not leave a message. Finally, I threw in the towel and threw out the machine. Too bad that customer service for such a marketed company can be so non-existent."
1,Don't waste your money!,"It took three times using the machine to get the correct ratio of liquids and solids to make good pasta. Unfortunately, a plastic piece in the driving mechanism cracked during the third use. On the fourth use the plastic mixing spiral kept slipping on the drive shaft. The whole machine is now in the trash."
1,This product sucks!!!!!!,"I bought this product, used the prduct by following the direction. The machine start making clicking sounds when it was time to send the mixture through the pasta dyes. Next thing I knew the tube that the pasta mixture goes through BROKE! I was very upset about this product. I was going to order a the part for it but didn't want to invest more money on the machine. This machine meant well but it was a failure."
2,Terrible for high alttitudes,I love alot of the Ronco products but his one I have to say gets a f. The parts are so flimsey and the 1st time we used it I thought she was going to blow! Even with ample water the parts seem to bend and crack under the pressure. The only thing that has been easy to grind and tube is the meat. To make matters worse it is a monster to clean. I am sorry but I have to be honest they need to make this product a heck of alot better than they are. Think twice about buying this product.
3,Good but not durable,"This product has excellent and neat design, but the materials it used are not durable - all the part are plastics. I think it will not last for 50 time usage. If you bought it for [$$$], the load is [$$$] per home made pasta - you need figure if it is worthing."
1,Good Luck,"Good luck to all of you that purchase the ""Popeil Pasta Maker"". I purchased one a little over a year ago through the TV add. I used it three times and the plastic parts inside the machine broke, and the machine wouldn't work anymore. I was unable to get my money back. Needless to say, I was very dissatisfied."
1,Worked for a few months...,"To the people that say it's more trouble than its worth, you're wrong! Get creative with your pastas and add spices to the mix. This makes GREAT pasta that you can just use spray butter on.I am editing my review. The first couple of lines were when I was happy with the product. Bought it as a gift, used for the first time on Jan 19, my husbands birthday, and it broke on my anniversary, June 6. I was so disappointed! If I had only spent $30 on it, it would be one thing. But this was just an overpriced piece of junk, used (and enjoyed) maybe 10 times."
4,Popiel Pasta Maker,"I have mine for several years now. At the begining I had a problem with one of the parts.Called the Co .and they sent me the new part .Makes great pasta, you have to get the right conistancy for it to work ""no to dry"" ""not too wet ""and use large eggs .I like mine ,can't make it all the time ,otherwise we surley will have a weight problem lol.I don't do this ,but I had to because the product is good."
5,I love this product !,"I bought this item 12 years ago. I used it approximately 4 times per year. Mainly bought it because my family loves homemade noodles. I have a lab & I freak out about dog hairs. It has a lid, so you just pour the ingredients into the certain marked areas (liquid/dry). My noodle maker finally broke a year ago. They didn't have it on the Ronco website anymore. Now, they are selling it again. I just received my new one. It has some updates to it, but, it is basically the same as the first model. I use my own recipe when making my egg noodles. It is so easy to use ! It gets a 10 out of 10 from me !!!!!"
2,"Well-built pin connectors, but they didn't work for me.","These are the second type of pin connectors I've tried. The first ones were the Monster Flex Pin connectors. The Monster one's were very difficult to fit into the A/V receiver's spring clips (the tips were too thick). The Cables to Go, on the other-hand, fit fine in the spring clips but could not hold onto the speaker wire when the two pieces of the pin conn"
2,No key to exercises!?,"The explanations and exercises in this book are clear, concise and easy to understand. But how on earth did they omit the key to exercises? It greatly diminshes the books value that you cannot check the answers to verify if you are learning this very important topic correctly. I would have expected better from a reputable university."
4,Comprehensive,"This book does an excellent job of explaining the Russian motion verbs. There are plenty of examples to back up well presented explanations. The author thoroughly covers the nuances and shades of meaning of the motion verbs in a compact book that doesn't waste the reader's time. The only problem with the book is that there is no answer key for the exercises. This somewhat limits the book's usefulness if you are trying to study Russian on your own. Overall, this book is well worth the money."
1,Worthless,"I bought this game at Goodwill for $4.00 and I am seriously regretting buying it. The game started out cute, with calming music and adequate graphics. However, things got bad fast. The music, for one, was too loud, and I couldn't adjust the volume, just turn music and sound on or off. Then I tried the tutorial, and found out how bad the game really was. The screen ""swivels"" with the mouse, and the menu at the bottom pops up when you mouse over it. So, you may just want to look down when you accidentally activate that annoying menu. Then, when the tutorial prompted me to change the trains speed by using ""+"" or ""-"", they wouldn't work, no matter what I tried, the train just sat there! Frustrated, I quit, but to my great dismay, the game had messed up my screen resolution! Now my laptop has black bars on the sides of the screen forever! I have to scroll down on every webpage too! Please, for sanitys sake, don't buy this game."
2,No 'customer support'!,"Having lost 3+ pounds by end of week 2, I thought I was on my way to good health and proper nutrition, but problems began to arise and there was no 'customer support' to contact! Finding myself very weak, having occassional bouts of forgetfulness and confusion, I must have been getting low blood sugar. (The assigned calorie card for my profile must not have enough calories for me personally to function on). I have since increased to the next higher calorie card, hoping it might still allow me to lose the weight, yet afraid to stay on the diet, fearing reccurence of the unusual, scary symptoms! A phone number with an on-call dietician is needed in case of problems to make this a workable program."
5,Truly Amazing,"I started using the food mover 23 Jan 03. With exercise and the food mover, I have lost 20 pounds. It is easy to use. I recommended/bought this item for two of my friends as gifts."
3,Grows on you,"This isn't my favorite Cheap Trick album, but I agree with others who say that there are several moments on it which shine brightly. The best song on it, ""If You Want My Love,"" is right up there with the songs from their first three studio albums and ties with ""Voices"" and ""Mandocello"" for the best Cheap Trick ballad ever. ""Adequate"" Cheap Trick is still a lot better than a lot of other band's best efforts, so good going!"
4,She's Tight - great song and video,"Cheap Trick meet MTV...their sound, energy and fun was perfect match for MTV and music videos...She's Tight is so good (video fantastic)."
3,Great Memories of this one,"Ok, so Cheap Trick were never critically acclaimed, but I have really good memories of listening to this album when I was a kid. The rythyms kick butt and every song is an upper. Get it for She's Tight, if nothing else. I wore my tape copy of this one out. I'm tempted to rebuy it on CD, but Ill have to wait till my Foo Fighters arrives."
2,So So Songs meets Wrong Producer,"Early 80's release from legendary power-popsters Cheap Trick doesn't show the band at it's best. The songs are a mixed bag...some ok stuff, some junk. But nothing here even comes close to the clever, razor-sharp Cheap Trick you'll find on earlier albums like 'Heaven Tonight' and 'Live At budokan'.Roy Thomas Baker's production work here is awful. The tight, raw vitality that was Cheap Trick's hallmark sound is replaced here by a sound that feels artificial and mechanical. But my major complaint with this record is the lack of dynamics. The mix is loud and cluttered with layers and layers of grinding, mechanical guitars and screaming vocals. And where's Bun E. Carlos??? It can't be him playing these stiff, mechanical, clanky-sounding drum tracks ! Baker's production work here stands among the worst I've ever heard. Couple that with the band's marginal songs and this one's a dud."
4,Great camera and printer combo!,"We bought this combo after checking out some of the other combonation's out there and this one is great. The setup and install were easy and had no problems at all. The camera works great, although it can only take a few pictures when set at the highest resolution. However, for us, that's not a big deal.The printer is very compact and has a handle for easy carrying. The camera connects on top easily and works flawlessly.The only thing I was disappointed about was that it said it came with a Photo Index card kit, cards to print the pictures on, but it wasn't in the box. We used normal note cards to try it out before buying cards. Not too big a deal, but still."
5,One of the better cameras,"I've used several digital cameras in the past and this one is my favorite. It has the fewest number of confusing buttons (especially no awkward, symbol-laden dial around the on/off button) and most of the menus are pretty self explanatory. Its highly compact and very durable-- I took mine on a cross-country trip through the middle of the desert. And, of course, it has the best picture quality of all the cameras I've used. Admittedly, it is hard to get pictures in low light (the shutter has to remain open for a while to capture enough photons, resulting in a blurry picture if you hold it in your hands), but this camera does have a hole in the bottom for a screw-in tripod for stabilization.Plus, its one of the cheaper brands out there. Best bet for my money."
3,Sloooooow flash recharge,"Like everyone else has said, this camera takes great pictures, but it can take a very long time for it to recharge its flash. It is very inconvenient when you are trying to take a cadid shot. If you have a large group posing for a picture and you don't like the first one, they all have to wait about 10 seconds for the flash to recharge before you can take another."
1,Not a very good camera,I have had this camera since December of 2005.But i got i with the printer too.The printer is very good.But more can be said for the camera.For a few reasons The battery life is very poor.Like it can probley last you 30 mins at the most.And some times if you take a lot of pictures you can use them from the camera.And it will say photo can not be found.And sometimes whene you turn the camera on the screen will be off.And the screen is kind of bleek and dark and blurry too.And the video quality is horrible.And when you are taking a video with the camer the videos are very blurry and poor.And when you take a video you can look at the video on the camera but you CAN NOT HEAR THE SOUND.You have to have a computer to here the sound.And my grandpa has a canon and you can watch the video and hear the sound on the camera too!!!!!And in my opinon HP makes better computers then cameras. Thanks.
3,camera review,"Camera seems to do different things at different times, no pattern to problems. Quite frequently will display ""error in storing"", also lens will stay out and camera will turn off. Ralph"
1,good photos but not durable and EATS batteries,"i got to get it off my chest. this camera takes great photos and they print out wonderful. BUT, the camera has several down sides: 1. as all have said, it eats batteries big time. this is a pain. 2. it recharges slow between flash and between non flash. forget about catching a great spontaneous moment. 3. not durable. i dropped mine out of the case from below waist hight and it does nto work at ALL. i am sure by the time i send it in and pay for shipping and repair i can buy a new one that is cheaper and more reliable. any suggestions????"
5,Need to get third watch out,Third watch is the best show on the air right now. I have been looking everywhere to try and buy every season. They have the complete seasons for sale of almost every show except third watch. I dont watch much tv at all but this show makes me stop to watch every night even watching the reruns. My entire family watchs the show. I know alot of people would buy the seasons if they were available. Please put the seasons out on DVD so we have the chance to buy them.
5,The UK gets it before the US?,"Third Watch has been my favourite show for the past six years. What I don't understand is how NBC could get rid of this show when it was still going strong.It also makes no sense to me how Season One is available in the UK BEFORE the United States! If it's not released here soon enough, I think I will just buy a region free DVD player and get the DVD when I go to England."
5,Bosco!! Bosco!!! BOSCO!!!!,"I have been a loyal Third Watcher ever since the very first episode aired! I even convinced my friends to start watching it around season 2. It took a long time to convince them to watch another series but realized quickly that Third watch was worth it. Now, we get together every week for what we call ""Bosco Night"". We are HUGE fans of Jason Wiles and the whole Third Watch cast.We record while we are watching and rerun it afterwards to make sure we didn't miss one important look or one important hidden moment. We need to have all seasons on DVD so that we can watch our favorite episodes over and over. Especially now that there are continuing storylines, we need to make sure we don't miss a moment. All new viewers need to see it from the beginning to really connect with the characters like we have. We want Bosco!!!!!"
5,The Third Watch,"What is the hold up? Come on already its been 6 years, PLEASE PUT THIRD WATCH ON DVD."
5,What's the hold up?!,Give the people what they want! We're all obviously willing to pay for it!Everyone please sign this and spread it around if you can.http://www.petitionspot.com/petitions/thirdwatch-dvd
5,THIRD WATCH NEEDS A DVD,"I LOVE this show. It it one of the shows I make sure not to miss. Unfortunatley I didn't start watching until the later seasons. I have seen a couple re-runs but not enough. I want the producers to realized what a huge fanbase this show has( one of the fan-forums has 2000+ members!) It is truly great tv and is an example of what other shows strive to be. The actors are fantastic, the music is superb and the directing/producing team is among the best in the business."
5,Third Watch DVD's ARE OUT THERE,"Okay, what's the deal? Not yet available, huh? I have found 4 websites that have the complete 6 seasons of Third Watch on DVD's for public consumption.Amazon, where are you? I depend on you."
5,Where's Third Watch???????,"I agree with previous posts, with everything else coming out on DVD why not Thrid Watch? I browse store shelves and see titles of shows that I have never heard before, just to find out they only ran for a season or two, but Third Watch that ran for many seasons is not yet slated for release. Great shows are getting canned and being replaced with stupid mindless shows, and don't forget the ever popular Paris Hilton :( wouldn't want to go 10 minutes without knowing about her using the bathroom. What is this world coming to when that counts as entertainment??????? People need to come together and start bugging WB, ""Jericho"" got put back on the air after viewers sent the network pounds of peanuts. How can we get Third Watch released on DVD?"
5,"Hurry up and put Third Watch on DVD, NBC","If anyone from the network wants to know if we want Third Watch on DVD, the answer is YES!!! I love Third Watch, my friends all know that when it's on, they better not even *think* of calling me! I've been watching it for the last four seasons faithfully, and I don't know what the network is waiting for but the show is in its SIXTH SEASON and they have it running in syndication on cable so what's the problem?! Give us what we want...Third Watch on DVD! :)"
5,Third Watch LIVES ON!!!,"I was very hurt to see the last episode of THIRD WATCH. My family and I have been faithful viewers of this spectacular show. Alot of stories were never fully panned out. So we the viewers feel cheated. okay at the end Sully spoke what happened to everyone, but it would have been much better to have seen it happen. How can NBC think that by cancelling this great show, we the viewers would continue to watch any other new show that would replace THIRD WATCH. The only show I watch is Law & Order: Trial by Jury. I hope and pray that the series comes out in DVD as well as a CD with all the songs played on the show ASAP. Thank God, that we can all catch it twice a day on A&E. Third Watch will be greatly missed but never, ever forgotten. THIRD WATCH WILL LIVE ON FOREVER!!!"
5,"""Wow the NYPD, the FDNY, and the EMS workers finally come 2-gether""","This show is ""AWESOME"".The writing of the script is brilliant along withthe acting, and the cast. Each episode will keep youon the edge of your seat. You never knowwhat to expect next. *KEEP THE SEASON'S COMING!!!!!!Iam ""DEFINITLY"" waiting for season 2."
5,Quick review,I got into watching Third Watch in 2001 and had missed most of the previous seasons. The First season is just as good as the later ones and just as much fun to watch. i can't wait for the second season to be released!
5,third watch,This is a great dvd set if you love this show.I gave it to my husband because he was a big fan of the show. He has been watching it nonstop. He can't wait for season 2 to come out on dvd.
5,Great show!!!,"Finally, this great show is on DVD. I loved this show and love the DVD. Can't wait for the remaining seasons to come out on DVD. I highly recommend this show to anyone who likes cop, firefighter, and paramedic shows. Third Watch has it all!"
1,Quality of Merchandise,"I have just received the first season of Third Watch. While I've yet to watch the disks themselves, I have opened the box and found 3 filmsy cases with all the disks loose, unable to fasten to the plastic holders because most of them were broken. The packaging itself is cheap and while all the disks look okay, I'm not holding out much hope that they will play without a problem. Because it will take a while to watch all 6 disks, I wanted to write this review quickly to inform other customers of the packaging itself. If the disks play without problem, I guess the cheap cases won't really matter but I will have to find alternate source of perserving my disks because they will not be safe in the cheaply made, broken plastic holders I received.Third Watch: The Complete First Season"
5,Third Watch DVD,I find it hard to believe that they have TV shows out on DVD that have only been on TV for 2 years or less but Third Watch that was on TV for a while and now off for a while still don't have DVD's out. That really sucks. Third Watch was a great show and should have never been taken off TV to begin with.
5,The end of the 55 (Camelot),"Like others I can't believe Third Watch is over. I saw ""finale"" in the TV Guide and assumed it was the season finale. After watching the show I re-checked the guide and sure enough: ""Series Finale"".I started watching it from the pilot and never missed a show. The characters that came in throughout the show (Faith's husband and kids, Cruz, Brendan, Holly, and the other female EMS) added a lot to the show.This show was fantastic from beginning to end. I liked all of the characters, especially Faith and Bosco. It was great watching Ty Davis mature over the years and Sully was a great first partner and friend for him. I'm glad he got some closure in the end. This show deserves a DVD release, unlike many others that have been released."
5,UK release,"Third Watch season one has just been released in the UK this week, so if you can play region 2 DVDs you can order it from amazon.co.uk ..."
5,We need Third Watch on TV....They were our Heros,We have waited too long for this to come out on DVD. It should still be on TV. Many of us in New York need to see our Heros from the show. They surely helped us when we needed it and many of us still do on a daily basis. Please bring back Third Watch.Thank you.A Forever Fan..S. Young
5,AT LAST!!!!!!,Third Watch has been one of the best shows to hit televsion since ER. It's about time that Warner Bros. release it on DVD. Keep voting for it!!!!
4,3rd watch,"I have not completed watching this series but should be by the end of the week. Overall it is a good series and worth watching, at times its slow, but what isn't?"
5,third watch: the complete first seasono,"This was a good replacement for ""Hill Street Blues"". Liked the show, the actors, and the story lines. It was great drama with comedy. Like Hill Street, never missed an episode. Too bad we can't get shows like these two anymore."
5,A great loss,This is yet another show that should have ran at least 5 or more seasons and was cancelled for no reason. Highly recommend this series to anyone.
5,Still Cant Believe They Stopped this show!!!!,"Please come out with season 3 for Pete's sake!!! This show was one of the greatest shows ever on TV and it was stopped for all this great tv we have to watch now!!Reality show after reality show...great programming!!! I hope some of the cast, if any takes time to see these reviews on here...it was an incredible, well written and with the most amazing actors ensembled in a show that i have ever seen!! Please release the rest of the seasons on DVD, so some of us who like quality tv will be able to watch this!!!"
2,Should be on Prime Instant Video,If it was on Prime it would definitely be worth it but having to buy every single episode is more expensive then buying it on DVD. Please consider it because I would love to watch this show.
1,Where is the DVD?,I rated 1 star because there is nothing to rate. Why hasn't NBC put out the season on DVD? What are they waiting for? I am waiting for my DVD's NBC...........
5,"Great Show, BUT.........","Third Watch was one of the best shows that television has ever seen. The show was amazing and quietly became one of the most acclaimed series of it's time. I highly recommend seasons 1 & 2, BUT don't ever expect to collect the whole series. Warner Home Video doesn't seem to have intentions of ever releasing the rest of the series onto home video. So unless you want to be frustrated, like I am, then maybe, just maybe you should ""boycott"" Warner Home Video and not spend your hard earned money on this GREAT show, until the rest of the series is released. I have attempted to receive answers from WB with no response from them."
5,Third Watch PLEASE,I have no clue why the show was cancelled. I DVR it on every channel of every day and watch it all day Saturday. I want every season on DVD. Now would be good.
5,What are we waiting for?,"Third Watch is now in its 6th season and still no DVDs? What are we waiting for? There are other shows that are not half as good, didn't even make it to their 5th season, and yet they are out on DVD!"
5,We want Third Watch - Third Watch on DVD,"Hey, bring on the seasons of Third Watch to DVD, we are waiting............PLEASE!!!!"
5,"Third Watch February 20, 2006","I don't know what the studio was thinking when they cancelled Third Watch from television. I do wish that they hurry up and record the entire Third Watch seasons on ""DVD""."
5,"Give Us ""Third Watch""","I can't believe a quality show like ""Third Watch"" is not out on DVD. There's so much crap on TV and the second the first season of it is over the networks and studios slap it onto home video, but a great show like ""TW"" doesn't rate anything more than syndication. What is wrong with the head honchos at NBC and whatever studio produced this incredible show? I started watching it for Bobby Cannavale, because he's a heck of a good actor and extraordinarily hot (and Eddie Cibrian and Jason Wiles are pretty hot too) but stayed for the excellent writing and acting. Each episode is like a small movie, full of little gems you generally don't find on TV. I would buy this series if I had a chance, so give me one!"
5,FINALLY!!!,"I've been waiting for this to come out on DVD since the show ended. Stellar show with great story lines and top notch actors, it never lost its edge or my interest from the first show to the last. I recorded all 6 seasons on A&E but I'd rather have all 6 released like this...are you listening Warner Brothers? There are still a LOT of fans of this show and I feel safe in saying that they would all purchase every season. Hopefully we won't have to wait so long for the remaining 5 seasons."
5,Third Watch,I am in shock that Third Watch was cancelled. It has to be my favorite show of all time. I've watched every show from the beginning and all the reruns on A&E. I'm glad to see others share my feelings. I can't understand why it was cancelled. It seems there are alot more storylines to explore. There should be some explaination available as to why it was cancelled.
5,"Great Programs, Bad Decisions","For anyone who didn't see the finale, it was truly bitter and sweet. Like the other shows, it was amazing, but at the same time, it was a reminder of how networks seem to let the good ones go and keep the bad. I heard about the 10-13 episode where Yokas saved Cruz when a guy had a pipe to her throat in an alleyNBC, this needs to be released on DVD. You've got a buyer in me for sure. I've recorded quite a few episodes but a DVD release is more practical. Between NYPD Blue and Third Watch, yall stand to gain a lot of money. Third Watch is better than a lot of shows on now, and probably still to come."
5,Some hope for us fans....,"First of all, I wanted to give this show 10 stars but I could only give 5. There is a little relief as I've found out that amazon.co.uk will be selling Third Watch on May 22, 2006 for 38.46 pounds (or $66.79). If you don't have a multi region DVD player, there is a Colby brand (DVD207) available at bargainoffers.com for only $40! I don't know how good it will be but I have to take that chance! I'm ordering mine as soon as I finish this review! I love Third Watch!!! :o)"
5,Third Wach is #1!!!,"Why has this series not come out on DVD yet? I can't believe this. I am very angry that it has not yet. I need my Third Watch!!!!! I love watching the reruns on A&E, but it would so much better with out commercials."
2,Wrong advertised product,"This goes only under existing rear bike racks as an extension. It is very small, as it is only 6 inches long and 1 3/4 wide."
3,Good for mastering concepts in the openings,"I really like that this book is divided into different openings. What I don't like is that it didn't really improve my game: there are plenty of books filled with master games with MUCH heavier analysis that I recommend over this one (the most instructive games of chess ever played, for instance)."
3,"Good book, but look elsewhere","The book is an excellent value for the money. However, the fact that it is written in descriptive notation as well as the fact that Zurich 1953 by Bronstein is of similar quality (and is cheaper) makes this book average to good."
1,Photo on website shows an #8 bucket,"The photo shows an #8 bucket, but when the product arrived it was #2 container...very misleading. It also states the product is environmentally friendly; however, it states on the container that it can cause permanent eye damage, is harmful to the skin and can cause damage to vegitation...I'm very disappointed with the product (which we decided not to use) and not very happy with the 100% money back guarantee."
3,"Great film, lousy subtitles","Yes, this film is a classic, and I love it. But don't use this version to introduce your English-speaking kids to their Hungarian heritage. Whoever did the subtitles wasn't a good enough translator to convey any subtlety at all, and instead just relied on the f-bomb anytime emphasis seemed indicated. Of course Hungarian is hard to translate, and there's no real way to indicate the levels of formality the characters use in speaking to each other, etc. But most reasonably literate bilingual types could have done a better job. Watching it with my husband, I was translating and commenting for him the whole time. Also, at several places the subtitles froze and left big chunks of a scene untranslated. Oh yes, and the translations of captions flashed by so fast it was almost impossible to get them."
4,Side Zipper Canvas Duffle Bag,"The bag arrived on time and is a considerable value based on durability. The only flaw I experienced was with the difference in sizing due to outside and inside descriptions. The bag has an outside diamension of 30"" X 50"" as opposed to an inside diamension of same as needed by myself in this case."
4,A slice of life in WWII,"This is another wonderful Nevil Shute book. A sort of adventure story set during WWII, it is the story of one family coping with an exploding world."
2,"For a more useful guide see ""On Your Own For The First Time","This is a good book for moving out, but I found that ""On Your Own For The First Time"" gave more information on starting off into the Real World. It makes a perfect gift for the graduates/divorced/widowed! It's a must for those that are venturing off into the world!"
4,free gift not worth much,"The backnobber is a great product. I am a physical therapist and recommend these to patients all the time. Especially following car accidents, or patients with sustained repetitive position and task jobs. The free gift is worth about $1, it is pointed on the tip - not very comfortable. But you're not buying the free gift, so who cares, I guess it works about as well as a tennis ball anyway."
5,Good price and good product,"I already bought my original Backnobber II at local store (for $45). It was recommended by my physical therapist and it helped me to relieve the pain around my shoulder blade, which was very difficult to reach for me.I bought this one for my Aunt for her lower back problem. She is also very pleased with the product. It includes user manual, mini tool, and original Backnobber II as described with much less price I paid."
4,Good pan for its price,"I mainly use this for braising job. The build is solid and the bottom of the pan is flat. Clean up is a breeze with bar keeper's friend. I braise two lamb shanks in the oven the result was perfect. The lid fits real tight, but it gets hot when I am braising for a couple hours on stove top - expected since all the steam trapped in the pan definitely makes the lid and the lid handle hot. The pan handle stay cool though."
3,where on earth do these list prices come from?,"the ""sale price"" of seventy nine beans is pure bunk. so is the list of one fifty! go to cuisinart site and you will see the list on this is seventy nine! one cant even find anyone selling it for one fifty. it is seventy nine everywhere!BE very careful about these sale prices on cookware, cutlery etc. amazon is apparently picking up macy's fake list prices nowadays. check the makers' sites to learn if the state list price is correct. inflating list prices by 50% and then stating fifty percent off is really not cool.it is a good pan. price description is PURE BUNK."
3,Great to cook with hard to clean.,I've been using non-stick cookware for years and with all the negative press about it decided it was time to go for stainless steel. The pan heats up quickly and evenly but make sure you use enough oil to keep food from sticking. There are two things I have an issue with. It recommends you don't use metal utensils because it will scratch the surface of the pan. The second one is cleaning the pan. There hasn't been a time that I didn't have to use cleanser to clean the pan. I'm glad I didn't buy the set and just tried the pan.
4,"Good, but not amazing","In my mind, Multiclad is supposed to give uniform heat over the bottom surface of the pan. My test for this is to put chunks of stew meat all over the bottom, and see if they get uniformly brown all at the same time. The uniformity is certainly better than a single layer stainless pan, but I think my cast-iron skillet might be a bit better. It's not bad, but not worth 5 stars. I do love the big size, so that you can spread out morsels of meat or mushrooms and get wonderful browning. It's much nicer looking than my old farberware."
4,cuisinart multiclad pro,"This is a great pan for the price...I like it very much. I also have All-Clad pans of the same type....I would say they are a step above this one, however, considering the price difference, still a very nice pan. The lid is a bit on the light side compared to All-clad lids and the handles get a bit hotter, but the pan itself is super."
2,Not as good as the audio,"Disappointing, because I thought I was purchasing a video of the audio CD I've enjoyed so much. The audio is Eddie's absolute best - quick and hysterical - I can barely drive my car when listening to it. This DVD seems awkward and stilted by comparison. Some of the same material but none of the spontaneity. Too bad."
3,Not so definite,"I am a great fan of Eddie Izzard, and have all his other DVD's. In spite of the glowing reviews I read on this one, I was somewhat disappointed in it, both technically and subjectively. There is no feature on the DVD to allow the viewer to listen in English and have English subtitles as well, which my husband and I both like since it is not always easy to catch every word Eddie says, and also I don't feel the material measures up to that of ""Dress to Kill"", which was my first exposure to Eddie and remains my favorite."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I have never been more disapointed! I have 3 of Eddies' DVDs' and love them all, but this one isn't worth the plastic it's recorded on."
4,refreshing,I hadn't heard of this person before. I was searching Netflix for Eddie Murphy to see what movies they had of his. (0) and found this fella to be brilliantly entertaining.
2,Disappointing,"Very disappointed. There were funny parts but not enough of them. I love his sophisticated humor though, so I will keep watching for new material from him"
3,A little too Brit,Eddie's always worth watching but this one seems aimed to appeal to an all-British audience - his later ones are more cohesive and designed to appeal to both sides of the pond.
3,Not Izzard's sharpest performance,"Definite Article has its moments, but if you appreciate Izzard most for his brilliantly insightful commentary on politics/religion/sexuality/life/the universe in general, check out dress to kill or unrepeatable. this show is comprised almost entirely of small seinfeldian bits about commonplace aspects of life.Izzard is always entertaining and insightful, but this performance is a little weak on the insight. Unlike his other performances, it does not contain so many observations that will force you to say to yourself, ""I've never thought of it like that. This man is a prophet."" A good show nonetheless."
2,Unreliable,"This hard drive is small and compact, but quite unreliable. I have tried reformatting this drive and still it grabs onto other programs and freezes them. The programs resume when I disconnect the usb port. It was a bargain, but there is a reason. I really don't recommend this. Why is it that people generally rate a postive review as helpful and a negative review is not? Nevertheless look for a solid brand."
3,My computer has never been slower,"I don't know what it is about the included software, but this really slows my system. Further, I always get a message that the backup failed. That is not very encouraging. However, when I check the drive, my files are there. The instructions with the software are not very good. Overall, I give it a ""fair."" It is relatively cheap and compact but fails to give me the ""peace of mind"" that I was hoping for when I bought it."
3,"As delivered, does not work with the Mac","I have an iMac G5 running OS 10.3.9. I found I only had permission to ""Read"" from the drive, which was useless. I contacted Maxtor/Seagate by e-mail and was assured that someone would reply within 1 business day. Seagate (which now owns Maxtor) finally replied 3 days later.You can partition the hard drive so that you can actually use it, although it took me a while to figure out how to do it. Here are the basic steps. Launch Disk Utility. Select the highest level icon that represents the hard drive. It looks like a hard drive and will say Maxtor OneTouch.... Select partition. You can choose ""1"" if you don't really want to partition the disk. Name the partition(s), decide on the size of each, etc. Then select the partition button at the bottom right. Voila! You now have read/write privileges. You can now use the Backup software from Apple which is probably better than the OneTouch feature anyway."
1,Worst Portable Hard Drive Ever,"This is my fifth portable (2.5"") hard drive and by far the worst one. I bought this hard drive 2 months ago at BestBuy and compared to others (one WD Passport, three home-made with 2.5"" internal drive and $10 enclosures), this one is EXTREMELY SLOW. Worst even, when you're using it every other program would be much slower; the CPU usage meter would not show why 'cause it's still at 2-3% usage. My computer is a reasonably fast system (Core 2 Duo E6300 with 2G memory for my desktop, T2300 with 1G memory for my laptop) but still suffers. No other portable hard drive, even the cheap home-made ones, have these problems."
1,Amazon drops the ball on a complaint about dead drive,"I purchased this drive and it was dead upon arrival. It would not be recognized by either a MAC or a PC, and no disc was included in the shipment. I was unable to contact the seller, who had no known phone number associated with the return address on the shipping label. I have written to AMAZON twice, without any response.Very disappointing customer service and seller realtions,Jerry ReedGiclée Makerhttp://www.newlightimages.com/"
1,MAXOR VENDOR,PRODUCT WAS INCOMPATIBLE WITH APPLE-ASK VENDOR TO TAKE IT BACK -ACCEPTED IMMDEDIATELY WITHOUT HASSLE AND REFUNDED MY ACCOUNT QUICKLY WILL BUY AGAIN FROM NY-TONER 100 GRADING M.SCHWARTZ
2,Not what I expected...,I wanted a drive I could put extra data on and transfer files between computers. THIS drive can only back up everything on ONE computer.Great for someone who wants a simple way to make a back-up copy of your computer.Bad for someone who wants a useful external hard drive.
4,Interesting espionage thriller,"One of McQuinn's earlier works, tells a believable spy story with a suitably twisting plot, and excellent character development. Recommended."
2,London Blue Topaz Pendant,"I was not at all happy with this purchase. The topaz is very pretty but the s.s. looks very cheap, does not look like .925, It looks as if you could have bought it from a discount store."
2,Sound Quality Question -- Input Appreciated,"Question for other readers -- did your copy have an obvious sound / video match problem? My copy seems to have a half-second mismatch on the sound track vs. video track.Also, the main Amazon product info says released 2005 -- but my copy (via a z-shop vendor) says copyright 2003. It is a DVD 9 release but works on my drive.Sounds like maybe an earlier (Russian) release of the same concert?Just curious -- is there anyone who has both versions to see if the sound matching was corrected on the other (later) release?"
4,an excellent resource for homeschoolers,"I have been homeschooling for many years. I am always looking for curriculum that might better suit my children, but I find I do not have the time to really do research. This book has done it for me. Not only does it explain the theory behind classical education and how to do it, it also gives several suggestions for curriculum in each subject. The suggested resources at the end of each chapter are wonderful because I can see for myself what would suit our homeschool, but not have to go through everything that is out there. I'm borrowing it from the library now, but will have to buy it to add to my own library."
5,GREAT BOOK FOR BEGINNERS,"I am in my first year of homeschooling. This book provided some great direction. It was an easy read, very practical. It is my reference tool/teacher handbook for all my homeschooling children.This book provides a great overview of the classical home schooling method."
3,"Informative, not detailed","I was wanting a bit more of a bullet-point type presentation by grade so I could ease my child out of school but keep pace with where they were currently in class. To incorporate the free online websites, I'd need a base of age-appropriate and cognitive levels as well as expected coursework for each grade/age. I was encouraged to get the 'original' edition as in latter versions there's the perception that she edited her philosophy a bit."
5,A Homeschool Must Read!,My first thought after finishing the book was that I wish I had read this when we first began homeschooling! This book is a wealth of information on classical education. It thoroughly describes how to implement it into your own home and gives plenty of curricula recommendations along with other helps. I would recommend this book as a must read!
5,Revised homeschooling plan,"Even though I have been homeshooling my children for the past three years, I found the information contained in The Well Trained Mind to be enlightening. I appreciate the specific outlines and timetables contained in the book. The book may seem overwhelming in what it asks of parents, but the authors make it clear how parents can implement the curricula from the book into their individual schooling agenda. I highly recommend this book to the beginning and seasoned homeschool family, as well as to parents who desire to supplement their children's traditional education."
4,A bit intense,But otherwise I like the ideas set forth in this book about a classical home education. We're not using their plan completely but incorporating a little here and there in our homeschool. I think that this is what most homeschooling parents do anyway.
2,"Before Training Your Child's Mind, Consider This . . .","1. If the authors have such well-trained minds, why do they take so long to make their points? After reading their tome, I felt like writing -The Well-Trained Mind for Dummies- or -WTM Cliff Notes- just to make the book's useful aspects (e.g., resource lists, approach to history study) more accessible.2. The ""homeschooling Bible""?--please! The only thing biblical about this book is its length. No one book could possibly tell all homeschoolers how to teach all their children. And a book's wild popularity doesn't make it a classic; it merely makes it a fad.And finally . . .3. If this is what it takes to have a well-trained mind, I don't want one. Implementing just a few of the book's suggested methods created a joyless learning experience for my children and me. Training (instructing/drilling) and educating (developing/enlightening) are clearly not the same thing. I'll take an educated mind over a well-trained one any day."
2,One to leave behind,"I have almost all the Kansas CD's again (had them when on vinyl), but this one was one I should have skipped over. Without Steve Walsh, something was amis already (go buy the 'Streets' albums), and the over use of piano and sax made this something else... not the memorable progressive art-rock band I know and love."
3,"Not conventional Kansas, but not bad, either","Kansas was the result of a marriage of two distinct bands with the leaders of each, Kerry Livgren and Steve Walsh, surviving the merger.Each had his own ideas of the best direction for the new band and often they diverged. In a way, it is amazing that all the players of this blended family stayed together for 10 years.Vinyl Confessions was the first Kansas album without Steve Walsh and, not coincidentally, Kansas first album that has never achieved ""Gold"" certification.But it's not a bad album. It's certainly a better compromise than to have disbanded completely. Aspiring hard-core ""Wheat Heads"" should own this disk because it shows Kansas through a different prism and musically it's a pretty fair effort. Some of these tunes are very enjoyable.Try it. You might like it."
4,Hmmmm......,"I really enjoy this album. John Elefante doesn't have the best singing voice, but he does a good job here. I think the saxophones and the other horns were a nice touch. It's more consistent than AudioVisions and it's also a better sounding album. They sound more like a rock band on this.And, as always, they're at their best when they're rocking out, like on ""Fair Exchange"" ,""Windows"", and ""Crossfire"". One of my few complaints is that some of the choruses are weak, especially on the song ""Borderline"". Also, they should've let Steinhardt sing more. Other than that, this is a very listenable and musical album."
3,A plesant surprise,"Listeners may not have high hopes for this album, as this was the first album to not include the original line-up. Although on firtst glance it doesn't really sound like Kansas and relies a lot on generic rock, after a while this album starts to offer a lot. Once you get into tracks like 'Chasing Shadows', 'Diamonds and Pearls' and 'Face It' you realise this is quite a good Kansas album.The band here is really tight and the playing is superb, and while it is not their greatest set of material to ever be written, there are still some really unique ideas coming through and sometime the material is really catchy. Ultimately you have a fairly solid Kansas album that succeeds in spite of a different vocalist."
4,"Solid Effort, still Kansas, ....this was from the 80's?","Solid Rock and Roll album.Kansas' Vinyl Confessions now sporting not only new lead singer, John Elefante. But a bit of a different Kansas sound. Still, vocal and band driven, but perhaps updated for the 80s. Don't get me wrong, this is not ""pop/techno"".One listen and you'll know what I mean. The band is here, tight, crisp production, great musical and lyrical, undeniably Biblical/Christ/Redemption/themed song-writing, along with the emotional strains of Robby Steinhardt's violin.If you are a Kansas diehard, leary of Kansas without Steve Walsh, give this a shot. If you are thinking this is only Kerry Livgren with Kansas in the background, you are mistaken.Its good, classic, progressive rock, miles away from radios' mistaken 80s caricature.Take advantage of the availability of the download it and turn it up.Rock and Roll never died, It just stopped getting promoted."
4,Good book if you want an overview of multiple areas,I thought this book had good overviews of many different areas of equine sports medicine. Probably not the greatest for super detailed info but great reference for body systems and response to training.
2,not recommended,"unfortunately the projects in this book are not that much appealing like the fantastic ones you might find in other series like the ""american house""... the materials are simple i agree, but the plans are very poor, doesn't add to your data bank of ideas, the photos don't help alot, and frankly it is the houses fault anyway, the plans are even worse, the text is very limited.I do recommed that you look somewhere else if you are looking for inspiration."
5,Gaither The Great,Bill Gaither has brought so much to all his gospel fans and all that he helps. I have never seen a bad video that this man has made. He has enriched our lives so much with his Gaither Family.I have never heard so many great singers in one room.I have heard songs that are new and from the past. I don't believe there has ever been a poor written gospel song. The talent is just beyond amazing and I love everything they sing. I started collecting the Gaithers and I now own about 30 of them.The best part about music is you never get tired of listening to it.I will keep on collecting him as long as he keeps on making them.
3,"Good, but just that...","If you like Homecoming music, this DVD is for you... They sing a lot (like Heaven DVD). But if you want to watch the Gaither Vocal Band... they sing just one and do back vocal to another (with Russ Taff). The title song is very good, besides three or for others, including a beatiful song by The Isaacs. In other hand, there's a terrible trio and some others songs to hear just once. I recommend only if you want to complete your Gaither Collection."
2,Passin' The Faith Along,Received the DVD in very good condition. It arrived in a very short period of time.
1,This Thing Sucks,I am a chef by nature so I bought this little instrument from Target thinking it would cut down on my prep time boy was I wrong. It was a waste of 10 bucks its now in the junkyard take my advice by a good chefs knife with the money you might invest in this.
1,Break Chop,"Don't even try crushing ice with this, like they show on the infomercial. It bent the blade, and became unusable. It was a big waste of money. Even when you are chopping something it can chop, you can only chop small quantities."
1,Sloooow Chop :(,"This is the first time I have ever rated an item. I felt like I had to tell everybody about this one!!!Please do not buy this item, you will be glad I saved you the ten bucks. I tried to chop up several things. The base is so small you have to cut up the pieces sort of small to fit it underneath the blades. The potatoes that I tried to chop up kept getting stuck in the blades. It was so frustrating. My husband and I both took turns. After about ten minutes of frustration I threw the dumb thing in the trash!!!Save your money, or better yet get an electric food processor!!!"
1,dont even think of getting it,"being single i thought it will help me to make cooking a little easy...but this was a worthless product. First, the inside volume is very less and secondly so called steel blades start rusting after 8 weeks..."
1,Dull and Rusy,"Bought this chopper to save time cutting up vegetables for my impatient toddler. Not only does it not cut well becaues the blades are dull, it rusted almost immediately when I put it in the dishwasher. I thought this thing was supposed to be dishwasher safe. I would recommend buying a smalll, easy to clean food processor instead."
3,This chopper does not cut it!,"I would have to say this is not as useful as I originally had thought it would be when I purchased it. I was hoping to use it to chop onions and avoid burning my eyes. This chopper does not cut it! On any vegetables with soft skins (bell peppers/onions) it leaves mushy due to the dullness of the blade.It does, however, work well on sliced pickles and nuts. I hate slicing pickles for tuna sandwiches and chasing nuts around the chopping board is less of a hassle now. Although I don't think it would work too well on whole pickles, again because of the blades are too dull to slice through the skins."
1,"Awful, terrible, DON'T waste your money!","The first time I &quot;tried&quot; to use this item, I tried chopping up a bell pepper. Instead of cutting through the pepper, it just &quot;squished&quot; it. The blades wouldn't go through the pepper. Next tried an onion....no luck. This item doesn't even come close to performing as shown in the infomercial. Don't waste your money on this one!"
1,Don't Buy!,Don't bother with this machine. I can't even get it to chop through the bottom layer of an onion. And forget putting a whole onion in the chopper. The blades are dull and you have to pre-cut items to make them fit in chopper. Waste of time and money.
1,Quick Chop - Quickly Frustrates.,"I saw the quick chop, and couldn't resist. I had heard such good things. Needless to say, it was a huge dissappointment. Save your $10 and buy a decent knife. It will probably end up saving you just as much, if not more time. Quick Chop, thanks for nothing."
1,Dull Dull Blades,"A friend of mine had a similar chopper from a expensive kitchen supplies store and it worked well. I bought ""Quick Chop"" and was extensively dissappointed. The blades so dull you have to slam the handle down to get it to cut anything. These choppers can be nifty, but go to a kitchen supply store and fork out the 25 bucks if you want one to work."
3,Cheap,"I haven't used any more expensive choppers to compare this to, but I've noticed I really have to slam on this one to get it to do much chopping- the blade was pretty dull from the start. It's not as easy to clean as they advertise- if you just wanted to clean one piece, the whole thing pops apart. I don't use it too often because of the cleaning, but it is more convenient to use than my mini-food processor for small jobs, and faster at mincing than a knife."
4,Worked great for Thanksgiving Dinner prep,"Funny how people either love this chopper or hate it. I'm not sure eveyone writing reviews gave it a fair chance because my husband and I just used ours for the first time yesterday and loved it. We hate to chop stuff so were dreading all the prep work for Thanksgiving Dinner. This little chopper did a great (and quick) job of chopping onions, celery and brocolli. Four 'chops' and the vegetables were pretty finely chopped. Took maybe three minutes to do two large heads of brocolli. I thought the cleanup was a breeze - unscrew the clear piece and just shake the pieces in hot soapy water - easy! We liked it so much we decided on the spot that we would write a review, something we rarely, if ever, do."
2,Royal pain to clean anything other than some vegetables,"It chops wonderfully. It diced wonderfully. Good luck trying to clean it. If you're doing anything like eggs or garlic (sticky bits), they'll get up inside and not come out. They don't ""just rinse off under the tap"". The only thing I've found that reliable gets between the blades (which are attached inside and don't come out) is a paper towel wrapped around a chopstick. Great product, as long as you don't want it clean."
1,Don't buy it!,"I agree with the other person...tech support is almost non-existant. These guys went on vacation over Christmas week and don't seem to be back yet. I did FINALLY get an e-mail giving me an 800 number to call (which isn't published on the site or in the software package...that # is 1-800-482-4567)...I finally spoke with a real peron who told me to e-mail her my info and she would take care of everything and e-mail me back. I'm still waiting...and waiting. At least my 3 day ""free mebership"" (the only way I could even see what the site offered) is still working almost 2 weeks later! Of course it doesn't allow you to download much. WARNING! Don't buy this software!"
1,Beginning to wonder if I will ever get it to work.,"The subscription comes with a serial number that is suppose to be your password to log in, but it doesn't work and I haven't had any luck getting through for tech support, via e-mail or phone. They do not have a designated phone number for tech support and the online tech support does not respond. I'm beginning to think it's some fly by night operation they are running. Wish me luck!"
3,EXCELENTE PELICULA - REGULAR CALIDAD,"Una de las mejores peliculas de Don Mario Moreno ""Cantinflas"", lastimosamente esta edición es un VHS RIP, al igual que muchas otras que se venden por acá:El barrenderoEl ProfeUn dia con el diabloEl MagoEl ministro y yoEntrega inmediataRomeo y JulietaPuerta JovenCaballero a La MedidaLa mayoria de estas peliculas tienen un video y audio regular, pero en particular en esta de ""Romeo y Julieta"" el audio esta entre cortado en la mayoria de escenas de la pelicula lo que la hace muy dificil de disfrutar."
5,A great romance continues....,I loved the books in this series that I have read. I would like to read ALL of them but I'm having trouble finding them. They're a great family to read about when your spirits need a lift.
5,Find Me a Man like that!!!,"I must join all the fellow Linda readers in applauding the Mackenzie family stories!! I just want it to go on and on! Please don't keep us waiting too long, Ms. Howard, for Chance's story, I know it will also be incredable! Hint: the longer, the better!"
3,"We love Linda Howard, but...","this book, was not what we expected after reading all the fine-work she has done over the past years. L.H. Could have made these two storys so much more indepth but frankly, she wasted the life of Maris, and didn't do much better with Zane Mackenzie. We hope that infuture, if decides to continue writing about the Mackenzie family, she makes their lives much more indepth and with love. We hope that she does continue the Mackenzie family and will write an awesome story about Chance, and especially Nick."
5,Wonderful!!,"MacKenzie's Pleasure was the first MacKenzie story that I read. Soon after reading this, I went on a MacKenzie search and was able to locate MacKenzie's Mountain and MacKenzie's Mission. To my delight, they were both just as enjoyable! Sadly, I did not enjoy the story on Maris as much. I felt like Linda Howard just threw a story together to give her fans one more MacKenzie. Linda, if you write one on Chance (I hope), please go back to the original writing style of the previous MacKenzie books."
5,Superb-hope the third one is coming soon-want to know more.,I loved the book and found myself wanting to know more about the MacKenzie family. Finding the second book was enjoyable and the characters were enchanting and enticing. I can only hope that Ms. Howard is planning another in the series to look into the life of Chance and the closeness of he and his brother Zane. Well done Ms. Howard.
5,MacKenzie's Mission is one of the very best love stories .,Mackenzie's Mission was absolutely the most romantic love story I have ever read. It has everything anyone could want in a story. More about Zane and Barrie and Chance and Nick. I can't wait to read about these characters who seem like real people.
5,MacKENZIE SAGA,"I have ready just about every books that Linda Howard has written. She just gets better and better. I would really like her next book to be on Chance MacKenzie. I thought that Zane was the hottest book, but I have a feeling that Chance will be even hotter. I would really like to see more of her older books in reprint. She is a fantastic writer. I would really like to know if she has a web site. Keep writing those great books."
5,A great read for anyone who loves romance the hard way!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I hope that Ms. Howard will put out more stories about this family! A story about Chance and the other brothers or about Wolf and Mary. This is the perfect read for a rainy day curled up with a blanket and a dreamy mind. Thank you Ms. Howard, I will keep looking for more books on the Mackenzies."
3,Not as described,"I rated this 3-star because it is difficult to handle as described by other reviewers.The most glaring ""defect"" in this product is that it is described as ""1/2 in. poly hose"" when, in fact, it is ""1/4 in poly hose"". This doesn't affect the way it works unless you are trying to match it to other products.Fortunately, the same product with the timer, Item R599DP, has the same ""defect"" and is described as ""1/2"" in but is in reality ""1/4""."
3,Not as described - Confirmed,"I love RainDrip systems, but I can also confirm that this kit does not include 75 feet of 1/2"" tubing as described - it is actually 1/4"" tubing.If you are starting a new system, this kit will work fine for you. The 1/2"" tubing is needed for people (like me) who need the 1/2"" tubing to expand an existing large system.-josh"
5,perfect,"It came before I expected and the book has no damage at all, I've really enjoyed, no problems at all"
5,Amazing!,"I have to agree with the other reviews on this book, it's a MUST have at any price.The art from the early Dragonlance covers has always been some of my favorite fantasy art, and this book dives deeper in the vaults to bring out art that if you're like me might never have seen. Some of the art is from the dragonlance calandars, posters, etc. This book will leave you with a deep appriciation for Larry Elmore and the other great artists who've done these covers."
1,False product description,"I just received this product today and was sorely disappointed when I opened the package. The product description states, among a few other things:""Oval compartment for gaming stones & dice with removable foam insertSoft foam insert protects gaming products""The product I received contained neither. Their is no foam anywhere to be found. The primary reason I had purchased this product was due to the description of soft foam inserts. Complete disgust with this product and the seller."
1,PRODUCT DESCRIPTION IS NOT ACCURATE- PRODUCT NOT AS DESCRIBED,"Product description is for a five deck holder with an oval container for dice, and the insert is made of foam. Product received has a cardboard insert with six square holders. I contacted the seller and they told me that they have discontinued the foam insert at Ultra Pro. They offered me a refund but since it's the only thing available I'll have to keep it. I am not happy that the seller did not update their product information to reflect what they were actually selling."
4,Great Product but one of the pictures is inaccurate,I needed this box for my Magic cards and its great but I was a little disappointed when I opened the box. The 2nd pictures that shows what it looks like on the inside is not the correct picture. The picture shows a oval shaped area designed to hold dice and tokens for game play. The case doesn't have that area for dice. It has 6 section but they are all meant for cards. I have a dice bag so I have designated one of the section for my dice and tokens. It can hold a lot of content and it a very nice case. Over all I am satisfied with my purchase just beware the inside doesn't look like it does in the picture. It's just annoying when you expect to get one thing and you get another but if you read this review you will know exactly what you are getting. It's still a great buy.
1,Doesnt match photo,Inside is a cardboard grid...doesn't match the photo. Yeah - I know it says Corrugated insert. But showing the wrong photo is misleading and its what I based the order on.
1,POS,"The picture is a lie, the inside is cardboard. This case is a waste of 20 dollars. Piece of S***."
1,bad company,Order product they took money then sent email saying they didny have the product and now i cant get my money back
3,Decent but with Design Problems,"It's a decent gaming case and protects my decks well, the foam is also well cut, the construction is of average qualify, but I have two major problems with the design of the case:1. There's no handle on the case, it's often awkward to carry it or even grab it when you don't want to put it on your shoulders. I often bring my case to work for lunch game sessions, along with my existing work bag, this proves to be an major annoyance.2. The big inner pocket is nice for oversize cards, but there's no zipper on it. When you open the top, it falls back to a 45 degree angle, which leaves your content to slide out.Because of the no handle issue alone, I'm currently seeking an alternative gaming case."
4,Great for MTG Players,Overall this is a very good product. Mine tore a little on the first day though. It comes with foam blocks filling in the holes where your decks go and I was pulling them out. One of them was not properly cut out so that it tore when I pulled on it (the rest of them were properly cut out and removed very easily). The next time I went to a friendly tournament I had many people comment on how much they liked this particular bag. Definitely worth the $30 I paid!
4,Pokemon card carrying case,Item as described. Great price. Other websites wanted double. My son loved it and it is exactly what he wanted.
3,Not what the picture shows....,This as it says with a corrugated cardboard as the deck separator. This does NOT have the foam insert for the inside as shown in one of the product pictures for this. Still a nice case but now I have to find a foam insert.Tracking took 3 days to show item was received for processing but was delivered (coming from Canada) in 4 days.
1,I've been decieved.,"Okay, super pumped to get my new case.. It comes and i get a case looking nothing like the picture.. I give it a one rating because the company lied. I would recomend this cas to anyone that actually WANTS a case with cardboard inserts, other than foam."
1,False Advertisement! BEWARE!,"Like other customers, I was unpleasantly surprised by the fact that the photo of the foam inserts, on which my purchase decision was based, was a flat out lie.What you get is a nice zippered box with a cheap as heck folded cardboard insert that will be crushed if anything is set on top of it without knowing how flimsy the innards are. God forbid the thing get damp. Very surprised by a product like this from Ultra Pro. They are usually the only thing I buy for my card-related needs. I will look closer from now on at their products, but even that wouldn't have helped me this time since the photo of the product is completely wrong.I feel cheated. Not a happy camper..."
5,Fraggin' Awesome!,The most bada** comic book character ever in his greatest story arc. I highly recommend this book to everyone...well everyone who isn't a dweeb.
4,Good product but did not work for me.,"The sizing was accurare for me [34"" inseam] it was too ridgid for my intended use. LE could almost use as a lighter weight version of a duty belt. Too bad it was not a bit thinner b/c the quality was great and would recommend it. I was not too keen on the single keeper, two adjustable/velcro or snap type would be better, as with its ridgity you really need two so it does not walk-arount your waist."
1,Too Small,Would not buy this again under any circumstances. It is so narrow that I lost it the first time I wore it. I have other ear cuffs that are much wider and I have had them for over 2 years. Never lost one. This one is not a good buy.
5,Classic and stylish,"Clean, classic styling makes this earcuff suitable for professional/business wear as well as for more casual occasions. I've gotten more compliments with this earcuff than with any other I've worn."
4,"Crime and Punishment, and Punishment, and ...","Less gory than hardcore horror fans might hope, yet more disturbing than anyone would expect, Nobuo Nakagawa's low-rent classic _Jigoku_ (_Hell_) paints a relentlessly bleak portrait of human depravity. At first the film spins a straightforward, Dostoevskian yarn about a well-meaning college student and his increasingly guilty conscience. But in the second half, events take a decidedly more Dantean turn. Nakagawa's surrealist imagery and daring camera work recall the best of the Italian horror mavens -- except that _Jigoku_ preceded their work by several years.Criterion has opted to give this film a single-disc treatment, with a perfectly decent (though far from spectacular) hi-def transfer and the original Japanese monaural soundtrack. An informative half-hour documentary, two still-frame poster galleries and a theatrical trailer round out the extras."
3,"If you aren't on drugs when viewing this one, you'll wish you were","Above average Japanese horror film, that goes completely off the rails about 3/4 of the way in. The ""lake of pus"" is a real highlight of the depiction of Hell (or, ""Jigoku""; see where the title came from?), and the actors depicting the tormented souls in the film seem to be experiencing actual torment...maybe Method Acting? Anyway, ""Jigoku"" is worth a look."
3,An original story,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.Jigoku, which is the Japanese language word for ""Hell"" is about two teenagers out for a drive one night and hit a drunken pedestrian. Falsely believing nobody saw them, they drive away. Instead, the victim's sister tracks them down and seeks revenge.The film contains haunting imagery of a Hell featuring many grisly images. Though mild by today's standards, I recommend parents view this film before letting their young children see it.The film has been remade twice and is still considered a masterpiece.Special features on the DVD are a documentary on the film's production, a theatrical trailer and a gallery posters of other films by the director and production studio."
5,"Funny, interesting, a good time","Sam Lipsyte delivers a playful and extremely funny narrative in Home Land. I loved the narrator's pent-up-rage-filled diatribe and what it says about the possibilities of our old school days, the lens of memory, and sweet-oh-so-sweet revenge. The humor, though sometimes dark, never falters, which is a much harder task than it may seem. This was one of the best books I read in 2008, and would love to read anything else Lipsyte publishes. A real find!"
2,Funny dialog and nothing more,"This writer has a great ear fro sub-slacker dialog, and that kept me going to page 111, when I realized there was not going to be a plot. While the concept is clever and the exchanges are funny, it's not enough, and without more substantial underpinnings, these virtues became first unremarkable, then tedious."
3,Yet another slacker novel,"Haven't there been enough of these already?What starts out to be an amusing series of tart ""letters"" written by main character Lewis Miner, aka ""Teabag"", to his high school newsletter turns into a tedious drag of pointless narrative. The story? There really is none. Where do the characters go? Nowhere. You've read this book before: late 20-ish, early 30-ish character ruminates on the pointlessness of his slacker life and drags you through all of his navel gazing, stoop hanging and pot smoking. High school is hell! High school reunions are hell! Oh, the crushing disappointment of not making it big after college! Oh, the tragedy of not making it through college at all! Blah.I'll give Lipsyte this much: his prose is distinct and interesting. There's a worthwhile style in his novel...it's just desperately looking for subject matter that can make use of it."
5,I heart sam,"this book is quite simply the Best Ever. i can hardly type for fear of drowning in hyperbole when i try to express its magnificence. it will make you giggle, cry, nod vigorously, roll your eyes in agreement, let out deep one-note HAs from within places of your soul no one has until now articulated, and shake your head in wonder. where has lipsyte been all my freakin' life? all this and i'm still not done with it: i'm officially rationing out the last 20 pages because i can't deal with the depression i'm sure to face when i'm no longer reading this fabulous novel for the first time. i can't overstate it, people. three cheers for teabag!"
3,"Funny, Fast read","I think I had too high expectations for this book after reading all the acclaim. It was humorous but somehow felt a bit lacking. Perhaps I'm just jealous because I feel I could top the failures of Lewis Miner but haven't put them down on paper. The beginning of the book was promising but then sort of dwindled, not really concluding with anything except violence. Reading the critic's praise on the cover did lead me to a better book though, The Russian Debutante's Handbook."
3,I thought it coulda been better,It starts out strong. It ends weak. In between it follows the mean-value theorem. I thought the characters had a little too much depth; I enjoyed meeting them more than getting to know them. Maybe this is my problem and not the book's. Maybe the book hit too close to home. Maybe I was not meant to enjoy the book. I started off wanting to loan the book to everybody. But by the end I just gave it to a guy to sell on Amazon used.
1,Too bad,"I don't often make forays into contemporary fiction, because the results are usually pretty disappointing. Home Land was no exception. I really didn't find much about the book to like. I thought the author was trying way too hard. I didn't feel much like laughing at anything, and I especially disliked Miner's snide tirades about how crappy everyone is, no matter how successful they are. I feel like this is one of those books that young, hip people like to read with the cover showing in coffee shops, laughing at the top of their lungs so that everyone will know how witty and with-it they are. This is not literature - it's just one big depressing cliche. Even if that was what Lipsyte was going for, it's still not worth reading."
1,"If you love mindless navel-gazing, this book's for you!","This book reads like a novel-length interview with Humbert Humbert on NPR's ""The Next Big Thing"" (for which a more accurate title would be ""The Next Big Nothing"")--hardly a match made in heaven! Most people--one would hope!--eventually outgrow the main character's adolescent self-absorption. Why any reader--or for that matter, any author--would want to waste their time vicariously reliving such a pompously uninteresting stage of life for an entire novel is a mystery. What's no mystery is why this character was so unpopular in high school and throughout his life: he's a crashing bore. As this book illustrates all too well, a facility with words does not necessarily mean you have anything of interest to say--unless you happen to find self-important whining endlessly fascinating."
1,Sic Transit Gloria,"Why only one star? the lowest galactic decoration of merit offered by the Amazonians? Here's why: I could not get past the neediness of this book, mostly its desperate need to be funny. I sat stony faced throughout the duration of my relationship with this book, which was short. I wanted to laugh. No one wants to laugh more than me. But nothing happened, not a chuckle or a smirk. I might as well have been reading the unabridged history of the Byzantine Empire, or even Moby Dick! And no one was more sorry than me, after all the good things I heard and read about this masterpiece. Maybe if it hadn't been hyped so much... or maybe if it wasn't so self conscious... or maybe if I never heard of it... The fact that I could not even finish a this short novel says it all, I think. But that's only one man's opinion."
4,Fantastic.,"Reading Home Land is therapeutic. It has an autobiographical feel, as if he's spun the events of his life into fabulously cynical gold. You can just picture Lipsyte enduring a whole lot of hell in his life- but with utmost patience, knowing it was just for the mill that would ultimately produce a work of genius. He's got everyone figured out. The characters and dialogue are indicative of an author with incredible psychological consciousness and emotional intelligence. Picture Arrested Development actually fulfilling its satirical aspirations. That's Lipsyte."
5,"Easy to Read, Easy to UNderstand",This is one of the best books I have read on Reiki. I have been practicing and teaching Reiki for a while and it was wonderful to read a book that I could recommend. I recommend it to all my Reiki level II students because David Vennells has written exactly what I would have said if I had written a book:) It is an easy read - like he is talking to you face to face - and answers many questions you may have thought of but but were afraid to ask. What I appreciate about the author is that he is not judgemental in any way and from the begining states that the reader should accept only what makes sense to them.
2,"A Reading From ""Gareth and Lynette""","Length:: 7:15 MinsTennyson has been tried by me in this, my first reading of him since a schoolboy, and, sadly, found seiously wanting indeed. Most every one of his poems is infused with a Victorian cant that emarrasses one. - Yet, the idea of Qink Arthur's court, drawing mortal men into a realm that is in the world but not of it, remains enchanting, if poorly executed. The passage I have chosen to read conveys this notion of enchantment better than any other in Tennyson's Idylls."
3,At least something good came out of it!,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas (it was what he wanted) after using it for pancakes once, the verdict is...He loves the batter dispenser, thought it would work great with the electric griddle, and the perfect pancake should be the perfect over easy eggs! also great for omelets the heart shaped pancake form was a mess, but over all he had fun playing with his new toys :-)"
1,Junk...,"With the wide gap between the pans it is impossible to flip anything but a sandwich. Eggs and pancakes go flying everywhere. Save your money, this is junk."
1,waste of time and money,"We recieved this today as a wedding present. I went to pour the batter into the NO DRIP dispenser and it dripped out both sides on the way to the pan, Dispensed the batter into the pan cooked side one, went to close the lid and flip for side two and Voila, batter slid out the side into the flames, large portion of pancake stuck on top and a few small drops cooking on the now bottom, I tried 4 pancakes, assuming the blonde in me wasn't getting it. HA for once the product is dumber than the user.The heart for making heart shaped pancakes is a waste to I put in batter cooked side one and went to flip it and the handle does not go the other way without going through the middle of the heart which is where the batter is."
1,Worthless...,Mine broke the first time I used it. The hinge holding the top and bottom together apparently got too hot (after only attempting to make 3 pancakes) and completely broke. The three pancakes I did manage to make completely burned after only cooking them for a few minutes. Save your money!
1,Pathetic Pancake,"The (Im)Perfect Pancake is a waste of money and the TV ad is misleading. The pan is so thin that it burns the pancake, but if you lower the heat then it doesn't cook at all. When you open it up, the oil on the pan that's up and vertical drips down onto your stovetop; I only sprayed a little bit of Pam on it. Or, it will cook just the outside and the middle will be goopy still. The dispenser worked for the first pancake but the batter got stuck the rest of the time. The Imperfect Pancake, the dispenser, and the pancakes that I tried to make went directly from stove to garbage can."
2,Don't waste your time!,"For only 11.99 i decided to buy the Perfect pancake. After 2 trys i made a mess in my kitchen. What a wate of time and money. On the TV ad, they make it appear to be so easy to do and it looks so good. Yet, in reality, this is a waste of time and money. Take the 12 bucks and go out to breakfest."
1,such a stupid device!,"Bought one years ago. The pancakes spill out. A skillet works better, but the best pancakes in my opinion are the mini packakes by Pillsbury. You can get them at sam's club. they are individual servings and 16 come per box."
1,Don't buy this horrible thing!,"I was so excited when I found the ""As Seen on TV"" Perfect Pancake Maker at my local Target store, and for such a low price! I couldn't pass it up. Then I got home and tried to actually use the thing. The main problem is the huge gap between the two pans when you close them. For sandwiches, it works okay as long as you flip it very quickly. For pancakes and eggs (especially eggs! HUGE mess!!), they fly out of the pan when you flip it. I tried waiting to flip it until one side of my egg was completely cooked, but by that time, it ended up getting burnt, and sticking to the pan. There's nothing like the smell of burnt egg wafting through your house. This is an absolute waste of money--you're much better off making pancakes the old fashioned way."
1,perfect pancake,worst thing i ever bought.as soon as u flip the perfect pancake all the batter flies out and it goes everywhere. i do not recomend it.
1,doesn't work,"After receiving the perfect pancake pan I was disappointed. It was great for making eggs, but you can only make one pancake at a time. The pancakes also stuck to the pan, I even used butter.After using this product once, the pan began to bend at the hinge, our third time and finial time, it fell apart. Now we have two little pans! The one flat side of the pan is great for hot sandwiches!!! So if your like me and now have two pans out of one, you could get some use out of it! I would not recommend this pan to anyone. Best of LuckA trick to keep pancakes warm: place them in a small metal bowel and put a plate over the top."
1,They should call it No So Perfect Pancake!!!,"OK, like most of us, you see a new invention on TV and you spontaneously agree that it's amazing and you buy the invention. Well I saw the Perfect Pancake on TV and ordered one right away. I thought is was a good idea until I used it!!! After waiting 90 days, yes you heard me right... I waited three months to get it, I came to the conclusion that that this is an item I can live without. Here are the problems! 1. The batter thingy would not stop pouring because it gets stuck. 2. It does not cook evenly, even in low heat the pancake was brunt. 3. The non stick stuff came off within the 3rd or 4th use. Thanks Perfect Pancake for adding new meaning to the saying: If it sounds to good to be true, then it ain't! One good thing came out of it... I like mini chopper that came with it free! It may have been a perfect idea but not a perfect product!"
1,What a mess!,"I just had to share my story and find it hilarious that everyone else's is the same. I was all set to make my first ""perfect"" eggs today but after I cooked the first side, I was suspicious about the shallow top half and huge gap between the two sides of the pan, so I moved my egg over to the sink in order to flip the pan over. After performing a fast flip hoping to cheat gravity, I noticed the egg had slid past the edge of the pan and some of the egg was in my sink. I tried to tilt the pan and the egg raced onto my floor. I was left with egg yoke all over my counter, floor and sock.Should I attempt a pancake?"
1,This was a joke and is a joke.,"We had laughed at the commercials for a while so as a gag gift I bought this for my girlfriend. As expected we went to make pancakes after having this take up space for a few weeks. Then we really started to laugh, the pans came apart and the pancake was undercooked on one side and burned on the other. I don't know if the 19.95 was worth the laugh, but if you have money and time to waste and want a good laugh and something to complain about buy this item."
1,Terrible buy,"I bought this thinking that it would be great for pancakes and eggs like they show you on the commercial. It cooked pancakes okay and forget about the eggs. Every single time I flipped, half of the eggs would spill out onto the stove. When the pan was in use it left a smell of something burning even if something wasn't. Save your money and do not buy this item. Trust me."
2,Perfect Pancake: Far From Perfect,"On television, the Perfect Pancake made perfect pancakes. In real life, what I got was not perfect. The size of the PP was too small to permit baking more than one pancake at at time. If I did not use spam spray first, the batter stuck to either side. Often, when I flipped it,the batter would stick. The batter dispenser was also less than perfect. When I put in the batter, it would leak out before I could release the batter into the pan. Clearly, what I bought was a small pan that could bake only one pancake at a time, so by the time I was able to bake several, the first was cold. Apparently, mom's way was best. Use a big frying pan and save yourself the [money]."
1,Never a perfect pancake...and the handle broke off,"This product seemed like such a good idea, but never worked like it does in the commercial. After three attempts at making the ""perfect pancake"" the handle broke off while it was being washed."
1,don't bother,"looks great on commercial (don't they always), but this is a joke. besides being an absolute mess maker, you can only make one pancake at a time. with a family, it is very impracticle."
1,If only it worked,"I thought the idea was great, but it just doesn't work. I use pancake mixes where you basically add water. It sticks and flips the uncooked half of the pancake out to the other side with the other 1/2 stuck to the pan. It would be easier and less mess to use the cake turner. :)"
2,Waste of Money,"I think that this is a really good idea, but the huge gap between the pan and the top plate makes for a very messy breakfast. If you aren't super careful and really fast at flipping, the batter comes out."
1,A big mess!!,"I agree with everything other reviewers said....when u flip it some of the pancake mix goes through the middle opening making a big mess. The very 1st time I used it, the bottom part turned black. I gave up on trying to flip pancakes, now I just use it as a regular pan sometimes."
1,The Mess Maker!,"After purchasing this product by mail order, I thought it would be helpful for making perfect eggs. Needless to say, when we tried it out, the eggs slid out of the side of the pan and went all over the stove making a huge mess! You definitely need to use cooking spray or else it sticks to the other side of the pan. Great to make pancakes, eggs etc.! Yeah! all over the stove! all over the burners! Don't waste you money, this product definitely needs to be impoved!"
1,Grilled cheese,The only thing this thing is good for is making a grilled cheese sandwich. Thank God it was only a dollar at a yardsale.
1,A Guest from VA,"I saw it on tv and thought it would be wonderful. I was wrong, it's HORRIBLE. Unless, you feel that you need to make your kitchen a piece of art with all the batter it throws. I was very disappointed."
1,What a Mess!!!,"I got this not so perfect pancake maker for my 11 year old for christmas, he loves to make pancakes. We tried it and on the first flip there was batter everywhere, and half the pancake was stuck to the top of the pan. I had to pull out my stove to clean up all of the messy batter down the side. We tried the next pancake and fliped over the sink. The stuff still went everywhere (at least in the sink). What a disappointment, I guess I didn't realize that there was a gap between the two pans when I bought it.I agree with the others that said maybe a good cookwear manufacturer will take up this concept, until then don't waste your money."
1,Brand New &amp; Caught On Fire,"This item was given to me a couple of years ago for Christmas. However, I was cleaning out my house and came across it. Therefore, I decided the next morning I would prepare some pancakes for my fiancee and myself. Well, I turned the stove on medium heat, like I always do. However, the crappy thing started smoking and caught on fire. The whole house smelt like burnt rubber and was filled with smoke. Hence, you get what you paid for on ALL items. By the way, I threw the pan in the trash."
1,How many do you want to buy? Or start cooking early!,You can only make one at a time!! This is clearly not made for a family. What was I thinking?? I end up using my griddle in addition to this little piece of useless junk.
1,NO STARS FOR THIS,"This is the biggest flop I've ever used. Don't know how they pull it off so successfully on TV. The top and bottom don't meet tightly, so when you go to flip, whatever is still liquid pours out the sides. My ceramic cooktop stove was covered with raw egg the first time, raw pancake batter the second time. I was NOT dumb enough to try a third time.Don't use this item, even if you get it for free. And you will probably see lot of them in garage sales."
1,NOT WORTH ANY AMOUNT MONEY,I got this thinking it was a good idea! What a waste of space. It is very messy! It does not close all the way. I use the pancake mix dispenser and that is it! i wish i could have giventhis product no stars.
1,Far from perfect...,"THe sides of this pan when closed do not come together. The bottom is a shallow pan but the top is flat, leaving about 1/4 inch gap all the way around. I can not tell you how many eggs my husband has lost on the stove in the flipping process leaving a yucky, runny yolk mess all over. It is also VERY small. To feed one person at a time you would need to be flipping about 3 or 4 of these at the same time. Since you are likely to lose at least 1 pancake through the gap, even that may not work. A waste of time, space & most importantly, money. Stick to the old fashioned method."
4,Better than WWF,"This is as close as a game can be made to the real thing. WWF is okay, but this is real fighting transferred into a brilliant game. It's not perfect, but it sure does come close. If it were any closer to the real thing it wouldn't be as fun to play. Hours of fun gaming due to all the options like career. If you like fighting games this is a must. If you like no holds barred fighting, then you will love this game."
3,"Very good, but prepare for some frustration.","If you have enjoyed realistic fighting games in the vein of Bushido Blade, you will enjoy the ultra-realistic version of the UFC. Much like Bushido Blade, matches play out more like a game of chess than a music video, and this is very good. Frustration enters when you attempt to fight the computer armed with very little idea of how to do anything. For such a deep game, the manual is woefully inadequate. You basically have to learn how to counter moves and switch grappling positions by trial and error. The end result is that your submission moves are usually unsuccessful while the computer's holds almost always put the hurt on you. If you can afford to spend enough time to figure the game out, I'm sure it's immensely rewarding, and for $10 here on amazon.com it's probably worth a shot. I would recommend heading over to ign.com and taking a look at the game guide to get a better idea of what you're getting into first, though. Break a leg. Literally."
4,Great For That Old Of A Game,"This game is great for that old of a game. The one thing I do not like about this game is once the CPU puts you in a submission the CPU automatically wins. Other than that, this game is great!"
4,"""Real"" Fighting","If you like real fighting, with blood on your hands, knees, teeth, fists, and feet, then you will love this game. Intended to be a realistic fighting game, you are in a ring with a competitor, and you fight until someone basically yells ""Uncle"" It's not a flashy game, costumes are all similiar to each other. The underground fighting world has been uncovered in this truely realistic fighting game. UFC takes more than just button mashing, you must know when to attack and when to withdrawel. Different fighters have different styles. From karate to wrestling, each player has their own strengths and weaknesses. Unusual must have for the Sega Dreamcast."
1,Might as well get into a barroom brawl,"No real martial arts, aside from the standard UFC ""punch me, then I'll punch you"" garbage.I was hoping that with a system based on the styles of martial artists we'd get something beyond ""Street fighting"" and ""Grappling""While it can provide some passing entertainment, it's not much good beyond that."
2,What The Heck?,Hey this game would be ok if the matches could last more than 5 seconds!!! But the graphics are the best I have ever seen in any fighting or sports game ever!! I suggest renting this one first!
5,THE most realistic fighter you can get.,"One of the things that makes this game as good as it is, is the ability to have a kickboxer take on a wrestler.Or maybe if you're in the mood, a sumo wrestler vs a jiu jitsu karate master.The games graphics are nothing short of amazing, either, with the best ring entrances I've ever seen.The sound is also awesome, and the hits sound realistic.Also, there's a create a fighter mode.So what are you waiting for?LETS GET IT ON!"
1,Dont Buy It (But read the review to find out why),"I would probablay have liked this game better if it didn't break within the first couple times of play. My DC won't even read the disc (and this isn't from abuse), and it reads all the other discs fine. I can't return it because it has already been opened, ...so I'm screwed. I highly advise you not to buy this game."
4,It's Sugar Free Fat Free Yumminess,"If you want Godiva white chocolate to fall out of the box, then you should just go buy chocolate at the grocery store and consume all the fat and calories.But if you want a yummy dessert that's easy to make, guilt free and good when accepted on its own terms, try this! It's especially tasty with some fat free cool whip. (Again: if you want rich and decadent, go and buy a pint of cream at the store and whip up your own topping)."
2,Taste,The White Chocolate flavor is not as strong as the chocolate. It's a nice treat but not every day or even once a week.
1,Does not taste like white chocolate,"First off, it does have the right texture of instant pudding. The pudding is super straightforward to make. You just whisk it into a couple cups of milk, less if you like thicker pudding. In 2 minutes it starts to set up into pudding.For sugar free, this one was okay. But the fake sugar taste was very easily detected, and it did not taste remotely like white chocolate! It had a very odd flavor that tasted exactly like some other food item I've had before.Stick to other flavors. This one is just not good tasting at all."
2,Cute but painful!,These shoes are adorable!...but I had the worse blisters I have ever had after wearing them. I have tried wearing them a few times but they are so uncomfortable that I can't even break them in.
5,Author's review,"The book is very well researched, including the history of the Creek Indians from the 1400's as well as the city from foundation to today. Very readable and interesting for a historical work. Editing of the original manuscript to fit into 240 pages retained most of the important information, but the editors did insert several grammatical errors that were not in the original."
1,Disappointed,"This purse is cheaply made, and is different from the photo. I think it's made out of cardboard. It looks much better in the ad, and I wish I hadn't paid as much as I did."
3,"Lousy customer service, nice products","I used to order from Body Time regularly, and I love their products. Unfortunately, I got tired of dealing with their poor customer service and finally stopped ordering from them. The last time I tried to order, I was having trouble reaching them via phone or e-mail or website, and when I finally got thru (via phone), I was told to leave a message -- which was never returned. My e-mail wasn't answered, either. All I was trying to do was place an order. In the end, I wrote a letter to the president of Body Time (Manda something or other), and she never responded. So I won't buy from this merchant anymore."
4,True scent.,"I am very pleased with the Gardenia scent of this perfume, it isn't cloying and is true to the real scent of the flower. The only drawback to this perfume is that it is not very long-lasting."
4,Fair Quality Print,"This is a wonderfully told story with fine acting performances all round. Unfortunately this Connoisseur Video dub is off of a below average quality print of the film. Be warned, the subtitles are not below the picture and on the black part of the screen, consequently they are at times difficult to read [i.e. white-on-white]. The original reel changes are also noticable. I am not sure whether a cleaner version of this film exists. These are minor faults which are typical of most 60s transfers."
4,VHS tape of 1962 movie,The shipping was according to the estimate. The product is according to my expectation in that it was indicated that the quality was not as new yet not too bad.So I am glad because I love the movie and could not find any copy in France.Alexandre
2,the best infleuential movie of my childhood,"I had seen this movie when I was in 10's. I was so touched, I've never forgotten this film since I ever had. It made me think about ""truth love"" and ""soul mate"" even though I was too young. After all, It comes to the best influential movie of my childhood. Recently, I found it by my country websites that related movies. I'm so surprised. 'cuz ..I thought that mostly people in my country(I'm a korean) didn't watch. but A few remember it. They almost said ""It's a really good one"" I absolutely agree..! I wish movie goer shouldn't miss it!!"
2,"outdated, not very good","i'm not familiar with this author, even though he seems to have written tons of books. the book was written in '76, so his predictions on what was going to happen in 2000 are outdated and inaccurate. the book is written in short, 1 -3 line paragraphs, which makes it easy and fast to read. the majority of the book is very negative, and states the obvious about the corruption of mankind. the very limited positive remarks, revolve around meditation and knowing they self. nothing really earth shattering nor enlightening. with regards to new age self-realization material, this is subpar."
1,"too many words...how about quality, not quantity?","interesting work...but oscillating between asenath mason and osho, one might glean much more. i mean all-out, qualitative LESS!too much conceptuality and blather going on here...at least from this squatting position, at dusk, in a desert...;)"
1,WARNING,"This book is antisemitic. It quotes uncritically from the infamous forgery, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and states such absurdities that Karl Marx 'was a fanatically religious jew' who preached atheism as preferable to any religion other than Judaism!I have long believed that anti-semitism is a sure pointer to the malign (diabolic?) source of the teachings of which they are a part."
5,Know thyself and you shall know the universe and its Gods!,"The Great Rebellion is that action when successfully lived, produces something beyond good and evil.The Great Rebellion occurs when a person who, with infinite yearning for Truth, breaks the shackles of degenerate social norms and finds authentic individuality.The Great Rebellion is Buddhist Annihilation at its very depth. Jesus stated it himself, ""deny yourself...""This is a book so profound that rarely (if ever) can one find all the levels of meaning. Entire paragraphs of information are written in a single sentence. Entire chapters are written in entirely one sentence paragraphs. Do not be fooled with the number of pages, this book's synthesis is so comprehensive that it can often be misunderstood.Any aspirant of knowledge will read this book with awe. Unconditionally recommended to those looking for something but do not yet know what."
3,If only I wasn't addicted to Utena I coulda saved some $$$,"I was less impressed with this second Graphic novel than I was with the first one. The changes in the character relationships were too large for me to swallow - in the anime things were completely different and while it's nice to change it and spice it up with variety and make it different from the anime... the shifts in personality of the characters made this second graphic novel make them feel like different people to me and made me like them less... in particular what they did with Juri and Miki. I LOVED the first Graphic novel and eagerly anticipated this one but found it lacking in the beauty and Utena-ness of the first one. There is a cute story about Chuchu in it though and that is worth it. Since the first novel was so good, you should purchase this second one just so you'll know what is going on when you buy the third one which I am hoping will be better. :-)"
4,Great DVD-not all Cindy,"I love most of this DVD. Just wanted to mention that it is not all Cindy Whitmarsh. Cindy gives an excellent 20 minute upper body workout that is combines exercises giving maximum benifit for the time. I love that one-I would call it intermediate and up. Then Stephanie Vitterino gives a great 10 minute buns burner. The ab workout on this DVD is awful!! Some woman in a bulky black jumpsuit gives the worst ab exercises ever. There are some really short bonus exercises, but I never bothered wiht them because they are really short."
2,Disappointed!,"I thought that this video would be on par with the others from Cindy Whitmarsh. Turns out that she only does one segment, and the other segments are very substandard. The exercises are boring, the instructors are uninspiring, and the filming is amateur. I can't recommend this video at all."
2,good but cd is damaged,"i always have enjoyed exercisetv work-outs, and this set is included. unfortunately, the cd is scratched and skips at least once during each individual work-out."
5,Our best source of receipies!,"We bought this book because our stack of 1998 Sunset Magazines took up too much room and we could never remember which edition contained our favorite recipies. Of the two book shelves of cookbooks we have this is the book we pull out the most. Along with the great recipies it is well organized, contains educational cooking tips, wine pairing suggestions, and interesting articles about areas for vacationing and dining in the West. Our favorite recipie is the Oven-roasted Chilean Seabass! We're buying the 2000 and 2001 editions today."
5,A so beautiful music !,"I have to write too about this CD because there isn't lots of informations on the web about this trio ! It's a real pleasure to listen this trio playing middle-est music with a such feeling ! If you haven't it anymore, have no hesitation to buy it !"
2,As pictured,"Package arrived in excellent condition, very well packed. This is very nice product, however it is far too expensive. Should be around $90 less than priced. I'll keep it despite it's overpricing. I guess you are paying for name, and made in USA.It has a nice warm cherry finish, and I enjoy checking it every day since it's arrival.Update: Have had for a couple of weeks now and notice it doesn't work! When we had a storm come in the barometer did not change at all! and the temp stays at 67 no matter if thermostat says 74 or wall clock/themometer says 75 in the kitchen, this ones always stays at 67."
5,she opened for bob dylan for god's sake,"wait: an independant artist who writes her own songs and plays the guitar and harmonica, and was asked to open for bob dylan in his recent show at Lake Tahoe, NV....sounds like heaven to me. Despite her short perfomance she and her entourage of musicians managed to please a crowd anxiously awaiting ""the man himself."" I'd say that's pretty tough to do, and damn she did it well."
1,"Makes some points, but disappointing","Murray condemns both polemic and intellectuals yet he only manages to look at things from an intellectualist viewpoint when he discusses things in-depth and he seems very skilled as a polemicist himself. Very critical of anyone except those with a similar background, including many shots at social scientists, northerners and whites as well as Murray's fellow writers even. Hardly a positive work, despite the subtitle ""Some Alternatives to the Folklore of White Supremacy"" which makes you think it will be more than it is."
4,Got the Speewagon rollin',"After Live You Get What You Play For, the world was ready to embrace Reo Speedwagon. You Can Tune a Piano, but you can't Tuna Fish earned Reo their first multiplatinum album. Featuring such classics as Time for me to Fly and Roll with the Changes, You Can Tune a piano, but can't tuna fish ranks among reo's finest work of the 70's."
4,"You Can Review A Piano, But You Can't Review A Fish","An outstanding album, and ""Roll With The Changes"" to this day remains REO's closing song. If ""Keep On Loving You"" and ""Riding The Storm Out"" are your only experience to REO, you are missing an ""essential"" album."
2,You have to use a LOT of this to treat the pool.,"You have to use the whole gallon to treat a 10,000 gallon pool initially, then half a gallon each week. I thought I'd save money over the quart that I bought at wal-mart that was a little bit more expensive. However, the quart only requires 2 ounces per week to treat, so actually is a better value in the long run. The quart lasts me all season, where this gallon only treated my pool once. My guess is that this gallon is HEAVILY diluted with water. I won't be ordering it again. Terrible value."
1,Useless,I purchased this to kill algae in my pool. I ended up using half the bottle and it still wouldn't kill the algae. There are better products out there.
5,happy with this product,"it may take 3, 4, or 5 days for this to clear your pool, but it does work and it lasts for over a month. i do follow the directions and add a little every week to keep it going , i will be buying more of this next summer when its time to clean the pool after sitting up all winter. thanks for finally a great product with a reasonable price. dont raise the price, we need good priced merchandise in a time when everything is outrageously over priced."
3,OK,"It keeps the pool sides and bottom from feeling slimy, somewhat. Needs to be used in conjunction with other appropriate chemicals to work correctly."
1,product not of any good,This product is useless. Normally I add 2 ounces of algaecide and good result . I bought kem tek 306 Algaecide from this seller. I used a gallon in the pool and I got more algaes in the pool. I am so dissatisfied with this product. please refrain from selling suchworthless product from amzon that will bring down the name of amazon.thanks.
1,Beware of faulty materials,"I purschased this fan for our new home 3 years ago, I only used it seasonally. It was installed properly and securely yet the connector between the base and the motor snapped and the fan came hurling down for no apparent reason, injuring my son. The company has not yet been notified of incident. I would have given 0 stars for this product but it was not an option."
3,so so,I really like Kira Langolf in this... but have to say that it was only good for my WORST pregnant days when I was so nauseous I couldn't do anything else. It was really too easy and very low intensity. This would be better than nothing though or a good place to start for someone that doesn't exercise.
3,Not quite a workout,"I understand that you need to ""take it easy"" exercising while you are pregnant. I wouldn't even consider this a workout. I never felt like I was receiving any benefit doing this tape. The instructor is bearable and not too obnoxious, but I just stuck to walking and swimming. The price is reasonable so it might be worth the money to some people, it just wasn't for me."
1,Hardly a workout!,I wasn't an extremely active person before I got pregnant so I wanted some simple workouts to keep fit and healthy without overdoing it. This was hardly even a workout. It seemed to me that she liked to hear herself talk more than doing exercise. I'd recommend the Perfect Pregnancy Workout video and going on walks and swimming. This video was a waste of money and time.
3,"funny,lighthearted,amusing","We lived in the islands for many years, and grew to enjoy Mr. Delima's work. This album is typically funny, especially the Addams Family takeoff and the Macarena/Mary Tunta workout. Our rating may be higher if we were current with local politics and events."
1,Not all of them worked properly,"I purchased 22 of these to give away as gifts during a Holiday Party. When the carton arrived, I opened one just to see it and it did not work. The second one we opened worked. I held on to the one that did not work and we gift wrapped the others. About a week later I heard from some of the guests that theirs did not work either. This was embarassing, to say the least. For the price of these items, you would think they would test them to make sure they work properly. I also did not care for the relatively large ""Made in China"" sticker on each one."
5,New Low Blood Sugar and You,"I read this book years ago when I was suffering from panic attacks. I must have went through a half dozen doctors before this one doctor recomended Frederick's book. I found all of my symptoms in this book and explained in simple words what was going on with my body. After following the diet in the book, my condition reversed itself. All my symptoms were gone. Thanks to this book I now live a normal life again."
4,An excellent aid in identifying possible hypoglycemics,"This book is helpfull to people who think they may have hypoglycemia, commonly known as high blood sugar. It has a list of symtoms and gives stories of people discovering their hypoglycemia. Unfortunatly, because it is so old, 1971, a few things are innacurate. For example, he no longer recomends the GTT (Glucose Tolerance Test) for possible hypoglycemics. Not only is this an emotionally draining experience, there is no need. Now he reccomends that people switch to a hypoglycemic diet, which is fully outlined in the book, and see if this alleviates their syptoms. Also, in this book, the issue of mercury fillings promoting hypoglycemia is not adressed"
1,Fact or Fiction?,"Readers interested in this medical area may wish to visit the following website : quackwatch.com where some revealing facts can be found about the self styled 'Dr' Carlton Frederick, who apparently, had no medical training, and found himself in touble with the law, for the unlawful practice of medicine."
3,Author A Big Fan,"the book was informative but not as objective as I had hoped. He was a trememdous admirer of Goldman. This isn't fatal for a biographer, but often is."
4,"A Great Way to ""Travel""","This is a great vicarious travel book that revolves around quilting and a great little quilt store in Paris, France. It is still open and several friends have visited and enjoyed it. The book is laid out beautifully with photos of picturesque locations in the French countryside to accompany each quilt block illustrated."
1,Very Basic,"This review is in reference to the Comparative Government half of the book. This book is extremely basic in its explaination of each of the six countries. There are important aspects left out which should at least be mentioned. The political systems and structures are an area which this review book is extremely weak with. If you are looking for a VERY basic and general refresher of the course, this book would be fine, but for more detailed study, I recomend a different book."
1,Useless,"A large percentage of the sophomore class at my school takes the AP Comparative Government and Politics exam. We were warned not to purchase this book, but some chose to ignore this warning, including one of my friends. I borrowed the book to look through it and found the questions useless and irrelevant. She received a 2, a non-passing mark on the exam, while I received a 5."
3,"Oblivion is a fun game, but it needs a high-end CPU+graphics card and it leaks memory","This is not only a decent RPG, but a good FPS as well. The downside to this is that it requires a pretty beefy gaming rig. You ain't going to be playing this on a laptop.My top-of-the-line rig (AMD 3800+ and an X800 Pro) that played HL2 spectacularly when it first came out is right on the edge of being ""merely adequate"" to play this game. Sigh, time marches on.And the game leaks memory like a sieve - 1Gb is the minimum necessary, and after a while it will crash on you, most likely due to the fact that something keeps misplacing memory somewhere.But if you can get past those issues, they packed a LOT of stuff into this game. It just goes on and on and on - this is a game you won't solve in one all-nighter - you'll need a few months to beat it.Save often, that's all I have to say."
4,"Great at first, dull in the long run","I loved playing Oblivion early on. What really got to me after a while was how repetitive everything was. Ruins and caves, while plentiful, are all much the same. As you level up, so do the creatures. Since this happens quickly, I ended up spending most of the game playing against bandits and monsters that were essentially repetitions of what I had been up against earlier. I have recently started playing Gothic 3 (with the latest patch), which is comparable in scope to Oblivion, but is much more varied.That said, I still recommend this game. There are lots of fun quests, and the stories are good. The Shivering Isles expansion is definitely worth adding."
5,The King of the RPG's,"Bethesda continues to make the smartest/most visually pleasing games in the world for RPG fans. I've never been interested in MMO's, and it seems the WOW dominance has shrunk much of the opportunity for single player games. However, having played this game for many hours (Level 43 at this point) and not having done much of anything on the main quest, I can say that the world presented is as immersive as any. Many kudos."
5,Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Collector's Edition (DVD-ROM),"Excellent, beautiful game. Well worth the money spent. A game that draws you into it."
4,"Fun to play, wish I had a better video card","I love this game. Unfortunately my two computers' video cards are not capable of handling it. One of my computers was even purchased close to when the game was released. Sigh.So beautiful, but I am missing its total glory with my lousy video cards."
5,wow. just wow.,"Having played Morrowind I have to say that Oblivion is much better all around. It is similar enough that you can leap right in with both feet but different enough to be fresh. The depth of the game is amazing. Stand on a street corner in the imperial city and you will hear potentially useful information, anything from people to talk to about training to good deals on useful items! Between the ever-present critters to bandits, marauders, imps, and nasty daedra just getting from one city to another by cutting cross-country is an adventure all to itself! And not forgetting the first enemy from Morrowind: The Rat! Main quest locations are spread across the map forcing you to go along and discover new ruins/mines/caves/bandit camps/daedra shrines/ or even a secluded farm or two! All in all an awsome game, and I'm not even half done with it!"
5,The ultimate gaming,"I have always been a shooter fan. This is the first RPG I've played. I love this game. I cannot believe how immersing it is. I have played well over 100 hours already, and I am not even close to finishing all of the quests. This game is highly addictive. If you are a shooter fan, you should enjoy this game even though there are no guns. I do have a custom built PC for gaming, and you will need a good system to run this with all of the stunning visuals turned on. You might get by on a weak system if you turn the settings down. I have an athlon 3500 processor, 1 gig RAM, and 2 nvidia 7900 GTO video cards in SLI, and it runs fine with most of the settings turned up. I recommend the collectors edition because the packaging is beautiful. This game is worth far more than I payed for it because of the endless hours of enjoyment it provides. I recommend this game highly to anyone who appreciates PC gaming. It's probably the best game I've ever played."
4,Choclate Coverd Ants Review,"In Chocolate Covered Ants the main characters are Max and Adam. The story is about Max and Adam making a bet about chocolate covered ants.In Chocolate Covered Ants Max, Adam's older brother, makes a bet with Adam.The bet is that Max says there are such things as chocolate covered ants, but Adam doesn't believe him, who will win?I think the book was gross when Max ate chocolate covered ants! It was gross when Adam ate ants in his ice cream. It was also gross when Max made chocolate covered ants. If you like to read gross books read Chocolate Covered Ants."
5,Chocolate Covered Ants Review,"Chocolate Covered Ants takes place in the home and school of two brothers. The main characters are Max and Adam. The story is about Adam who does not believe people eat chocolate covered ants.Adam has a birthday and gets an ant colony from his aunt. Max makes a bet with Adam that people eat chocolate covered ants. Then when Adam gets his ants he starts to keep Max out of his room. Max goes out to get some of his own ants. Max's friend Larry hears about the bet and tells their mom then the bet is over.I thought Chocolate Covered Ants was a funny book because Max and Adam fight for no big reason. Adam puts ants in Max's bed when he is sleeping. Another funny part was when Larry said, ""I have chocolate covered ants"". The other reason the book was funny was when Max and Adam's mom finds out about the bet of who can eat the chocolate covered ants. If you like funny books than this is the right book for you."
5,Ruletacular!,"So check this out... You're hopping up and down... You're listening to this album... DUDE... You're ROCKIN'!! C'mon, Ben Weasel likes this. check out the RC5."
3,Lack of Substance,"I feel that I have been a ""geek"" for the last 8 years. I am in the process of moving into a position of leadership and am striving to gain information on the most effective method being a leader. I had hoped that this book would give me insight on what it takes to lead ""geeks"", but I found that the knowledge in the book was very superficial and did not give me any greater knowledge on what to do to assume my new position. I felt that McConnell's ""Rapid Development"" was much closer to hitting the mark when it comes to giving insight on ""geekdom"". My recommendation is to look for another book if you are looking to understand the mind of the technologist."
5,Packed With Knowledge!,"Management consultant Paul Glen's thorough discussion of geeks brings you brain-to-brain and eye-to-eye with high-tech, specialized knowledge workers. Don't blink: you need these people, so you need to know how to fit your management style to them. Glen describes their primary personality traits and attitudes: commitment to logic, interest in problem solving, independence and, to put it politely, occasionally under-developed social skills. The author, who doesn't seem to mind describing an entire subset of the labor force as if each worker in it had the same personality, explains what geeks need from a manager. You need to nurture motivation, provide internal facilitation, furnish external representation, and manage task, structural, and environmental ambiguity. We suggest this organized, authoritative guide to those who manage knowledge workers. If it's all geek to you, here's the codebook."
3,better for non-technical managers,"I think this book would be more useful for managers who are coming from a product marketing or more non-technical background. For managers coming up from technical roles (including project managers working on technical projects), a lot of the concepts in this book will be familiar, even obvious. Some of the sections on managing ambiguity were useful, but overall if you've just started managing technical people, I'd recommendPeoplewareinstead."
3,Not bad for a general discussion and understanding,"This book was used in a PhD course at Capella University as a basis for discussion. The author clearly has an understanding of technical individuals and their general attitudes and mindsets in an IT environment. However, the book reads a bit like a self-help approach towards management and is entirely the perception and opinion of the author. If someone is new to managing technical people, then I do recommend this book. But if you are an experienced technical manager, you may find the continual reference to ""geeks"" a bit tiresome and his opinions lacking substance."
5,Turbo Jam Ab Jam review,I recently purchased this DVD and I love this workout! It is so much fun and you will definitely work up a sweat. I recommend this product.
2,Not Original DVD,Watch out. This DVD is not the same as the original with Special Feature which includes Tony Horton's ab workout. That was the only reason I paid $52 for this dvd and it does not include it.
1,Does not work - also very noisy.,This motor stuck in certain positions and would not return to the docked position. Also a very noisy motor. Amazon replaced it once - the second motor did not work either. Rebuilt motor from Napa at about the same price now works fine instead.
4,A children's library addition,"I am a librarian for my church library. I'm always looking for a good book at a reasonable price. Amazon.com helps me meet my budget. We opened the use of the church library this October to the day care located in out church. ""Who says Quack?"" is a great addition to the children's portion of our library! The pictures are cute (I am a sucker for duckies) and the size is easy for small hands to hold. It probably will hold up to some teeth chewing on the cover, not to my joy though. I would have preferred the pudgy book to have been a little larger for ease in processing for library identification. It would have been nice to see more inside the book before purchasing too. I cannot complain about shipping; the book arrived in a reasonable time span."
4,A deeply felt portrait of small town life in German Texas,"I loved this book. It flies in the face of present fashion. The pace is slow, the voice is gentle, the stories are loosely structured. But the portraits of members of an old German-Austrian-Texas family in Texas are so true and touching, I found myself holding a page for a long time. Older readers would especially treasure the old-fashioned feel of these books by a writer now dead."
3,Like Cardboard,"This is a nice size, though I'm not sure how durable it will be, especially with a 10-year-old owner. The construction is more like rugged cardboard than anything else, though the belt clip and handle make it versatile. Not a bad product."
3,Too Short,"Decent for the price, except for my 28"" arrows, the quiver is too short, and so there is too much arrow sticking out. The result is that my quiver often tilts under the weight, and dumps all my arrows on the ground.I'm going to attach a heavy weight on the bottom with packing tape to reduce this problem."
3,Sufficient.,"I purchased this product for backyard archery, which it works for... But that's about it. It seems very poorly made and moves around constantly. If you intend on moving very little and simply wish to hold your arrows near you, then perhaps this product is for you. At almost $10 though, the price is narrowly worth the value to me."
5,Arrow holster,I got this as a gift for Christmas and my son loved it. Arrived very fast. Would recommend to anyone who needs a arrow holder.
3,It works okay,"The arrow holster does the job, but it could stand being a bit longer. The weight balance is such that with practice arrows, the holster wants to tip over with any movement. As long as you are staying relatively still while practice shooting, it works fine."
4,Adequate,"The holster could be slightly deeper, but other than that it is a nice toy for a child. I would by again for the price."
2,Would be five stars but...,Would have given this five stars but the strap is way to short to put over even a child's shoulder and there are no adjustable clips. It's basically a nice paper towel tube that clips on to your belt.
1,Way too short,"Quiver is way too short for arrows. My guess would be that it's suited for bolts, not full length bow arrows. I rigged it up with some cardboard and duct tape, but I wish I hadn't wasted the money on this"
3,does its job,"I recieved this product a week ago and find it able to do its job. I use it for back yard shooting and it ok. not a rugged typ of quiver for the field but very adequet for back yard plinking. very light weight and affordible. so if you are looking for something to hold your arrow while you practice this is a good choice. also short enought for the kids to wear while they practice. has a clip that just slides on a pocket. front or back arrow faceing, its just a good low price holster."
3,Basic Product - Satisfactory - Nothing Special,"I bought this for my son to carry his arrows in, hoping to have something that could either attach to his belt or be slung over his shoulder. This quiver works hanging from a belt but is not set up as a shoulder quiver, now would it work as a ground-standing arrow holder. For the price it is acceptable, but nothing to specially search out."
2,Too Short,"This would be an excellent holster if only it were 6-8in longer. As it is, it will tip and your arrows will fall out. You can easily make adjustments with some rope and duct tape, but then again, I suppose you could just build an entire holster out of rope and duct tape and save the money. I use it, but I'm not thrilled with it."
3,ok,"my 8 yr old got this for a costume. It was a little hard to keep upright on her shoulders. The clip that comes with it does not work very well for her. Having said that, it is a toy, so I didn't expect much. serves its purpose."
2,For kids,This is a size for kids arrows. I must have missed that when i bought it. Nice construction for the price though.
3,Gets In The Way,"I got the hip holster because the shoulder holster was a bit pricey. One, theres no tubes, which is good because you can fit more arrows in, but bad because your arrows move around way too much, and the worst part is how much it gets in the way. It's for target shooting, so you're not moving too much, but still, I find myself bumping it and knocking arrows out a lot."
3,holster,This was much smaller than I expected. It was an affective addition to my son's Robin Hood Costume. It was OK
2,Ok,I thought this would be better for my husbands costume but it wasn't. There was no strap so he didn't even use it for his costume.
2,I thought it was larger and it could carry more arrows,Didn't like this product. It is cheap and it looks cheap. I though the size would be taller and larger. It cannot carry many arrows and they stick half out. Bad purchase.
4,Very hip holster !,"This holster has (2) hard plastic tubes which you can easily insert your arrows into.The capacity for (6) arrows with field tips is ample, but I don't know how it will be with broadheads.Then again, I would not be target shooting many arrows with broadheads.Good holster for the money."
2,looks like a toy,this product looks like a toy it is cheap and small i would not recommend this to anyone. you get what you pay for
4,Good for beginners,This was a good complement to the archery set we got for our 9 year old grandson for Christmas. Good child size.
2,cheaply made,This item works but is a little cheaply made for the price. Do not care for the belt clip and just didnt care for the item.
5,arrow holder.,bought this to go along with the bow and new target arrows I bought for my 9 year old grandsons. they love this with their new compound bow making a full outfit.
3,It's alright,"This holster is alright. I bought it because it was the only holster/quiver I could find for under $50. It does the job, and it holds plenty of arrows, but it's difficult to 1) keep on your belt/pocket and 2) bend down while it's on (without the arrows falling out)."
3,i love my hair,This is a good book for Pre schoolers (african descents)or kids that is curious about there hairit was a bit young for my kids but they enjoy reading it
5,I love my hair!,"very nice book. easy read, colorful pictures. I use this book in my child care center for multi cultural reading."
4,Good book,"Good book, with nice story line. We like to purchase books and other media that show children of different cultural and ethnic backgrounds for our children. This was a good fit with that AND our girls liked it."
5,Great Book!,Got this book the help explain to my daughter that we all have different hair and to love the hair she has. Great book!!
5,Better than I expected,"I expected this to be a run of the mill ""black hair is great!"" message, but it really exceeded my expectations. The illustrations are lovely, and the story is really whimsical and creative. Keyana's hair is downright magical! I have a daughter and niece that hate having their hair combed, so I hope that they will be able to relate to this book."
3,Good,The story was very true to life. I know a child whose Mom grows her hair long and it can be challenging.
5,I love this book,This book made my daughter fall in love with the fact that her hair is unique.....Every african american home should own this book
5,I Love My Hair,"A little African American girl named Keyana narrates this delightful story about celebrating your identity and accepting differences. Keyana describes her mother combing and styling her hair. She is upset about how uncomfortable and painful it is for her mother to do her hair; she wishes she had different hair. Her mother goes on to tell her how lucky she is to have her hair just the way it is. I Love My Hair is a great way to introduce children to embracing differences. The illustrations were beautifully drawn and helped the reader ""see "" why Keyana had the feelings described in the story. Young African-American readers will be able to relate to the characters, and non African-American readers can gain some insight into an experience that many African-American girls go through. The vocabulary introduces words that many children may not be familiar with; however, the illustrations depict what the author is describing. This would make a wonderful addition to a classroom library."
5,MUCH BETTER THAN NAPPY HAIR,"IF YOU WERE THINKING OF BUYING THE BOOK ""NAPPY HAIR"", GET THIS ONE INSTEAD. ITS BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN."
2,It should not hurt Black children to have their hair groomed,"Amazon lets you read the first several pages of this book, and I am glad that I did before purchasing it. The first pages are about how much it hurts when the mother combs her daughter's hair. My belief (and my experience with my daughter) is that it is possible to groom African-textured hair beautifully, without hurting the child. This is very important to me and it would not make sense to me to read a book to my daughter with the message that she should expect it to hurt. That was what previous generations had to put up with and we can do it differently now."
5,Fast and efficient.,I was very pleased with the service. It was fast and efficient. I would choose this seller again.
1,Super Christian,"This book has one underlying theme: Jesus Christ. If you are ok with this and willing to accept that this is the key to life, then this book will suit you. If you are not a Christian and have doubts about God, then don't bother. I only read the first few pages and I was immediately turned off because it claims that if you do not have a daily spiritual relationship with Jesus Christ then you have no hope for intimacy."
5,Listen to it a few times,Jamie Woolford and The Militia Group Label are one great combination. His new Let Go CD is one that requires a few times to listen through before it all grows on you. The first and last tracks on the CD are probably some of the catchiest on the CD. Great guitar riffs and super nostalgic vocals. It's a very cozy CD once you try it. You can download a good song on their myspace website.
2,its okay,I was expecting more - I found the routines boring. For the price and other reviews I thought it would have been better. I was disappointed with this purchase.
5,Old guy getting diesel,I am 64 and the RKS was easy to follow and motivating. It has increased my strength and flexibality that I was not able to achieve by just using just weights and weight machines at the gym. Following th DVD motivates me and gets me to do things I never would have done. I can actually say I have lost about an inch and have a harder body. I am pretty sure that if I continue using the RKS this old man will have a six pack or at least something closer to a six pack I have ever had.My wife has even given me compements on my progresss.Thanks RKS
1,Not very challenging or very informational,RKS Was nothing like i fiqured not hard realy same warm ups and cool downs on every dvd and nutrition guide was a joke.Order dvd set never recieved my 15 lb Kettle Bell..Tried for two weeks and going send it back for refund.
3,This sequel's all wet....,"Fans of the Ripley series will find a few enjoyable moments, particularly in the characterizations of the well known characters of Tom, Mme Anette and Heloise. Otherwise, there is little suspense and even less ultimate payoff. Strangers to the Highsmith works will most likely be left completely non-plussed. This is a particularly dated and unclever work."
2,Losing the plot,"Having enjoyed other Ripley stories, I found all the cental characters in the book unlikeley, and discriptions of Ripley and his relationships irritating and was glad to finish the book, by skimming the pages towards the finish."
3,Dullness intended or not?,"Tom Ripley is a character that I feel drawn to. He challenges the morals of the reader. However, the content of this book was rather boring, and the all anticipated climactic moment was a disappointment. After completing it though, I asked myself: Would this have been a more gratifying read if Ripley were his more brutal self? Might this is be the message Highsmith wants us to get- that we as readers champion the acts of the sinister, amoral Ripley. We see him as a hero more so than the deviant that he truly is; thus the disappointment. This is Highsmith's genius."
2,The Return of Ripley,"The Prichards move into Tom Ripley's quiet neighborhood in the French countryside. The couple seem to know all about the people Tom has murdered in the past and torment him with crank calls, packages, menacing letters, snapshots of his house, and even follow him and his wife to Tangier where they vacation. Tom brilliantly turns the tables on them when they begin fishing for a corpse in a river they suspect Tom has hidden a body."
3,"Not The Best, But Still Worthwhile For Fans","Highsmith's Ripley novels declined precipitously, from the pure brilliance of the first three (""Talented Mr. Ripley,"" ""Ripley Underground,"" ""Ripley's Game""), to the less dynamic ""Ripley Underwater"" and the rather sad ""Boy Who Followed Ripley."" The latter two are poorly plotted but well-written (as always with Highsmith). Whatever you do, don't start with this one-- begin with ""Talented Mr. Ripley"" and move along chronologically-- then pick this up and read it (if you wish), as it fills in some neat little gaps in our understanding of Tom and his friends. But compared with the first three, this and its successor are mostly dispensible...."
5,The best cleaner wax,"Hands down the best cleaner wax out there. I have tried dozens, nothing compares. Zymol works the best. Very easy to apply and the results are amazing. Best of all it's all natural and contains no harsh chemicals like every other brand out there, check the ingredients, no petroleum! Makes my 26 year old classic sports car original black paint look better than most NEW black cars. No joke!"
2,Leadership Theory Is Not Practice,"I used this book to teach an undergraduate course on leadership. The book was not my choice. The articles and research were edited in such a way that the reader really didn't feel that any of the theories were supported or substantiated by the data.If it was the authors' intention to leave room for personal reflection and opinion, they succeeded. As for the assessments, the text, including the instructor's manual, provided little direction for interpretation.I wish Pierce and Newstrom spent more time on and went into greater detail with the chapter introductions."
3,"Tedious, but less than some...","(2nd ed.) This book is a compendium of 44 articles on leadership, intended for higher education audiences, especially management students in college. The authors also include 19 self-assessment instruments for the reader. The book finishes with 11 case studies and ""experiential"" exercises (as opposed, I guess, to cognitive exercises?).The topics are slanted toward social-psychological (roles, gender effects, group dynamics, leader behaviors, cross-cultural contexts, and so forth). As a result, the writings can be tediously ""scientific."" The book is very well referenced, but, as the authors state, it is not a review of the leadership literature.The cover drawing is one of five people putting sails on a boat that is not in the water. I presume this is sort of a Magritte comment on leadership. I think it also is a comment on the patchwork tedium of the subject. And after all the sails are on, what does one know about leadership? And, is one a leader?"
4,Vivid recollection of first Hanukkah as told by a young girl,"Told from a young girl's point of view, this gorgeous book describes how the first Hanukkah came to be. There are details about using a reed pen and writing on papyrus that add historical accuracy to the vivid story. Best for ages 9 and up but smaller excerpts could be adapted for younger children."
2,Hard to Believe,"I really enjoy Midwestern History, and I like to read as much as I can about the topic. Sugar Creek in my opinion, was rather difficult to believe - I'm not sure what it was, but as I read through it, I found myself questioning the credibility."
3,Bassless,"When I listen to these, I can't but help compare them to there predecessor, the PMX 100s. Several things were improved with the PMX 200s, such as a closed design and closer fit to prevent sound leak, pads that wouldn't fall off and were a lot more comfortable, and IMO a clearer sound. One crucial thing however that drew me to the PM 100s in the first place was eliminated in the PM 200s, and thats bass. These things virtually sound like a hi-fi version of stock ipod earbuds as far as range goes. Even if you don't compare them to the PM 100s, I still would have expected more bass from $80 headphones. If you listen to music that utilizes much bass, don't buy these."
2,Uncomfortable for larger heads,I bought these because I had the Senn 100's (which are terrific) and wanted a behind the neck band. These were very uncomfortable. I have a large melon for a head so this is likely why. They also were not as good as the 100's from an audio standpoint either. I returned them.
4,"fast shipping, good quality","I received the headphones quickly and they were well packaged. They are comfortable and have great sound quality. They don't block out too much outside sound due to their small ear size, but sound so great and are closed so the music comes through clearly and the volume does not need to be too loud to be heard over outside noises."
4,A Sound Product,"Very Good product. It does not produce the full base response you get from the in ear products senheiser makes, but I purchased these to wear during lawn work and walking. These are perfect for any physical activity. They sound good and they stay on..."
