1,Mr,"This card is not to be used with Pocket PC 2003. Any advertising to the contrary is misleading (if not outright lie). I learned (as many others) that ""Windows CE 3.0 or later"" does not mean compatible with Pocket PC 2003. Linksys does not have a driver for Pocket PC 2003 and does not have a schedule for releasing one. The beta driver (available) is a far cry from what a driver should be. If you are running Pocket PC 2003 get another card if you want to use it right away.Mirek Buzga."
5,Another winner from Linksys,"This card was very difficult to install. I had to:1) Open the package2) Power up the Zaurus 5500 (V3.10 ROM)3) Plug in the Linksys card4) Configure the network connection5) Surf the net and get emailI wish everything in life was this difficult. :) The WCF12 seems to have very good range. It constantly indicates a higher quality signal strength than the built in wireless card in my Sharp SL6000 in any given location.I'm not sure how I'd rate power consumption as this is the first and only wireless card I've got for my 5500. The 5500's aren't known for their battery reserves anyway. About 45 minutes of surfing and it's time for a recharge.It doesn't block the stylus port either which is a big plus. So, sure I'd buy another for my Zaurus anytime."
1,Rubbish!,"Just got my HP2215 and WCF12 today, and it's been almost 12 hours, I have tried almost every GOD-DAMN thing and still this bloody thing does'nt work! and i just ordered an AmbiComm card, hope that works! so that's $50 which im never gonna see again - my advice, don't bother buying this product!!!"
1,WCF12 and the ipaq h2215,"I'm going on 4 months now and still this card does not work with my ipaq. I'm running WIN CE4.20 on the ipaq, I've tried installing the drivers every-which-way I can think of to no avail. Linksys support did not help, they are just as baffled as to why. I'm running a 3-system wireless network using Linksys everything works great, just can't get this card to work. I've been reading all kinds of reviews from all kinds of web-sites for this card, and have come to the conclusion that it does not work. I'm going to use bluetooth instead, hope that works."
1,Doesn't work with Windows Mobile 2003,"Card worked with PPC2002, but when I upgraded my Dell Axim X5 to Windows Mobile 2003, the card stopped working. Have followed all the advice on Linksys' website to no avail. Tech Support does not respond by email or telephone. Try another card with Windows Mobile 2003."
1,Card's neck breaks too easy,"After only a few weeks of owning this card, the plastic connecting the thicker black radio portion of the card cracked where it meets with the metal Type I portion of the card. This resulted in the card being useless and only receiving a singnal after wiggling the head of the card. Even before the head started to crack, the card had very poor connectivity. Keep in mind this card is also a lot longer than most of the other compact flash WiFi cards out there, and that the issue of it breaking is very common."
3,Great Value!,"Got this card for my Axim and it works great when it works. Installation on my Axim didn't go too smoothly because of something (maybe because of the WCF12's software or because of PPC 2K2) that caused IE not to use the WCF12 for networking.Using an old WAP11 and a few WPC11's with this card and connection would drop from time to time thus requiring a reset and reseating the card. However, I can't be sure if that's because of my v1 WAP11 and WPC11's or because of the WCF12.The software could be better at managing different profiles by not requiring me to re-enter the WEP paraphrase everytime I switch profiles."
1,Absolute piece of Junk,"Don't listen to people that will tell you this will work with PPC 2003 it may or may not. I have a tell Axim with the 2003 upgrade and have spent the last 5 hours trying to get this to install, it won't. The Linksys support is a joke and not worth the effort. I have given up. Do your self a favor and find another card. I was going to sell it on ebay, but don't want the bad Karma of passing of this piece of junk to another unsuspecting soul."
1,Don't buy it for PocketPC 2003 Devices,"Just to echo the concerns about a serious problem with WCF12: It doesn't really work with PocketPC 2003. Yes, there is a beta driver, but it's been in the beta stage for months, with no update in sight.So, look for a CF card that you know to be supported by PocketPC 2003."
5,"Wireless for a Zaurus 5500, at Minimal Cost","After reading tons of reviews from this site, I went with this card as it fit my budget. AFTER I upgraded the Zaurus ROM to v3.10, I was ready to go. No problems installing. Does suck the battery power though. The next card is on my Xmas Wish List.Does not block the stylus, as I read numerous articles about several cards doing that. The user feedback has been great in helping me make several choices about my hardware purchases here. Thanks!"
1,WCF12 doesn't work with the Dell Axim,"I purchased the WCF12 Wireless Compact Flash Card and it DOES NOT WORK with the DELL. I returned two cards to Linksys who offered great technical support and they tested and return several new cards and the cards seemed to work for a while and then they would stop working.I spent countless hours trying to get the cards to work and I realized that I shouldn't have to spent this much time everytime I want to go wireless.Linksys really needs to realize that If the card doesn't work with the DELL then they need to stop offering it until they are 100% sure it will work.Now I'm searching for a card that will work with the DELL. My feeling is this, when I want to go wireless I should be able to plug in the card and it should work and that's all there is to it!"
3,"Pocket PC 2003, try this driver!","Just to echo the other reviewer, it does not work with PC 2003. I emailed Linksys, and they replied and make it clear that all their wireless CF products do NOT support PC2003, yet (as of Aug 3, 2003). They are working on it, but no time frame available.Linksys is really good though: I emailed them saturday night, and they replied sunday!! I have some of their other products and they work flawlessly, and their customer service has always been one of the best I've seen among tech companies.(Update Aug 18) Today, I read from newsgroup that it works with a generic driver WLAN_ForWinCENET400.zip. Amazon won't let me put urls on review, so just search the web for this driver. Too bad I had already returned the CF card and missed out the rebate period, or I'll try it out myself."
1,waste of time...,"Despite the claims on the box, the linksys drivers don't work with my PDA (HP Jornada with SH3 processor running WinCE3.01).big thumbs down, it's getting sent straight back where it came from."
2,1 star for Linksys and 3 for the product,"I was awful excited about a wifi card for slot 1 pda's. But lo-and-behold, the wcf12 doesn't currently support HP Jornada 54X series PDA's. Linksys support and engineering acknowledge this and state they are working on a release of an updated driver. You can find that out IF the tech support rep knows what he's talking about (most don't know what a jornada is). I did some hunting and pecking and finally found the beta out in a newsgroup. It works, but Linksys won't support it ""yet"". It's been over a month since they told me it'd be out in the next week....Think twice..or search the net...Hint - Yahoo groups - HP Jornada clubs...good luck."
2,Keeps Dying,"I have had to return it twice for replacement and need to a third time. It also burns power like an inferno. The radio's pretty weak too. I'm comparing it to Symbol's Wireless Networker that I had, lost, and couldn't afford to replace."
1,Does not currently work with Windows Mobile 2003,"No driver support for Windows Mobile 2003, Linksys supports told me ""They are working on a driver, please check the website for updates."""
1,Linkys WCF12,"This is the biggest POS i have EVER came into contact with. It doesnt' work with pocket PC 2003 period dot com. I have never had a problem with Linksys products up until now, i am very glad i haven't as their tech/customer service sucks complete A$$. I spent 15 hours on the phone with them (i would say over 12 hours on hold), more than 10 hours trying to get this thing to work right and still nothing. Add to that they want to try to charge me to"
2,Was good at first,Worked well for the first four months with my maestro. Now the card seems to get hot and the screen goes blank. Have to soft reset my PDA to get the card working again.
3,Works great unless you are running pocket pc 2003,"I had this card for over a year and it ran flawless with pocket pc 2002. If you are going to use this card for that software I recommend it 100% But...after uprading to pocket pc 2003 It has not worked since. I have installed the latest drivers for this card from the linksys site along with their beta drivers I found in a forum on pocket pc passion, none of them work. I have e-mailed linksys tech support several times without a response. I am getting a new card from someone else and you should too if you are buying it for a pocket pc 2003 version pda!"
1,Does not function with Pocket PC 2003!,I purchased this card after reading several glowing reviews of how well it work with the Dell Axim pocket pc. They all left out one detail though... the OS version.This card does not work on the Dell Axim with Windows Pocket PC 2003! I was able to test in on another Dell that happened to be running ppc2002 and it installed flawlessly.I can't say whether it works with other pocket pc's running 2003...
5,great picture book,Going on a trip and didnt want to buy a book there and carry it home. This way I dont have to and I can read and see all the beautiful places I m going to
5,SUPER!,"For that kind of price I think you should buy it NOW!!! Don't think, if you really like trance THIS ARE THE CDs TO GET!!! I bought them couple of month ago and I am still in LOVE with them. It's the best collection of trance I have seen so far. BUY IT!"
1,9 lbs? More like 3 lbs if you order from KEDcorp!,"There are a few different types of smoke wood listed on amazon with the same picture. I ordered apple and cherry chunks about three weeks ago. I assumed these were from the same company, but beware.. if you buy from KEDcorp you're likely to get ripped off!While this listing is for 9 lbs of wood, I only recieved a small, 3 lb bag in the mail. I contacted the seller, KEDcorp, who said they would look into it. It has now been over a week since that contact, and they have not responded back.There are other sellers here on amazon that you can buy apple wood chunks from, for a significantly better price per pound. I suggest supporting those sellers, who offer a better deal and are not false advertising. I won't be buying from KEDcorp in the future."
2,Severely disappointed,"I was all excited to read the glowing reviews of this video and give it to my son who is 2 1/2 years old. My husband is fluent in Spanish (his family is from Guatemala) and my son was born there. This video is a severe disappointment. The children repeating the sentences in spanish have poor pronounciation and so do many of the adults (many of whom have a Southern twang). I believe that if you are wanting to teach a language, you NEED to have correct pronounciation at all times, not a child who says ""gwacias."" It should have always been native speakers. There is also too much emphasis on food; the puppets are annoying and some scenes are just pointless.Oh well. I wouldn't recommend this video at all."
1,The Worst - save your money,"This is aweful! Horrible Spanish, ""spoken"" by non Spanish speakers with a bad gringo accent. It is truly one of the worst things I have seen ever. And also horrible typos in the written sections. This is the most pathetic thing I have seen.Avoid this like the plague.Send me my money back (and something more for having to have suffered through this!)"
5,4 year old loves CD,"My 4 year old started taking Spanish in Pre-K. I asked anotherparent if she knew of any Spanish tapes or CD's that my child might enjoy and learn with. She told me of a Children'sStore selling CD's called Mommy Teach Me Spanish. She said hertwo children loved it. After purchasing the CD my daughter fellin love with it. She loves the animation and above all theother children that speak Spanish. This CD has added lots offun and learning to our family. I watch in with my child andwe both learn and play. I have recommended it to my friends thathave children. We just purchased the new CD about ""Sweet Dreams""and love it even more. I found this review site searching tosee if anything new had been released. Thank You allowing reviews"
1,DON'T BUY THIS UNLESS..,"This product had great intentions, but disappoints severely. There are virtually no native Spanish speakers used in the film, which is essential in proper acquisition of pronunciation. I am a certified language teacher, so can speak from experience.So, unless you don't care if your kids speak Spanish with a bad accent, don't buy this product. If you want your kids to learn the correct accent, look elsewhere (even Baby Einstein Language Nursery features native speakers)."
1,kindle edition truncated after 96 pages,"The title is pretty self-explanatory.Amazon is still working out some of the kinks involved indelivering content.Since there is no way to preview a kindle book one takes one's chances when one orders a public domain book in its kindle edition.This turns out to be available through Google Books, if one wants to read it online."
1,"It syphons, but does it really work.","Yes it siphons from the bucket as long as there are no restrictions on the hose. No lawn sprinkler, no drip system, nothing can go on the end of the hose without disturbing the siphoning action. So yes, I could just walk around the yard with a bare hose end. Bought the item to make things easier not more difficult or time consuming."
3,BRUCKNER SYMPHONY 9 AND BEETHOVEN-BRUNO WALTER,"Please disregard my previous review of this recording. As time has passed, this Bruno Walter performance has grown on me. This Bruckner 9, to my mind now, has some of the qualities of inner dynamism and spirit of his later, studio recording. Though not in the later studio recordings' class, this recording is not a waste of time.This Bruckner 9 has some of that typical Walter warmth and spirituality, coupled with the New York Philharmonics' legendary precision."
4,DeWalt DW618 a great all around router at a good price,"It doesn't matter if this one is your first or tenth router. You're going to be in for a treat. Smooth,quiet, powerful and accurate. This one does what you bought it to do. Not a bunch of bells and whistles just a complete well-made working tool that won't bust your budget.** The only negative preventing a full five star review is the switch location but you will adapt to it quickly. DEWALT DOES IT AGAIN!"
5,Very nice router!,"I chose this router over about a dozen other models because it had a great ""feel"" in my hands. It has a lower profile and center of gravity than most, so it has less tendency to tip, even on fairly narrow stock. It has plenty of power, and the variable-speed, slow start-up controls make it nice to work with all different size bits. The detachable power cord makes it easier to set up on a router table. I just wish it came with a case."
1,Black eye for DeWalt,I bought the DeWalt as a replacement for a DW618 router that burned-up prematurely. It was about 14 months old with only light use. I replaced it with an identical one because I had accessories to fit it. The new one did not work. I had to take it to the repair shop right out of the box. Brushes were installed incorrectly. I have to baby this router. It sparks excessively. The DW618 seems to suffer from poor engineering and quality control. Brings the total DeWalt product line into question in my mind. I will not buy another.
1,Unreliable Product - but Looks Nice,"When I first got my Dewalt Router, it looked nice and felt nice and packed some nice features like a soft start, variable speeds, and easy height adjustment. However, a little less than a year of use, the router would often times not start and began loosing power during the easiest cuts, like a round over on 3/4"" pine on the lowest possible speed. I figure with a name like Dewalt, I could not go wrong...but that was exactly what I was, wrong! Now the router will not even start. To Dewalt - nice look and features, but very unreliable. I choose to use my limited time in the shop to build furniture, not play with unreliable tools; I have machines from the 1950's that have never given me a problem, and I have my Dewalt router that is 1 year old and won't start - is this what one can expect from Dewalt?"
1,Dewalt DW618 Router goes up in smoke.,"The Dewalt DW618 Router that I purchased for my home workshop did not hold up. I used it on two projects for less than 5 hours. The motor started smoking after running it in its slowest variable speed for about 30 minutes. After shutting it down to let it cool, when it was restarted, it smoked and seized up. While it appeared to have plenty of power for the panel cutting that it was doing, the motor got extremely hot when running at its slowest speed."
2,Great router....till it broke,"Had this router for 3 years...used it on avg 3-4 days/week for moderate tasks. I thought overall it was a great tool until first, a bearing went bad, then about 6 months later the fan attached to the motor armature and the piece securing the collet to the body broke into pieces during a slight chamfer cut in clear, soft REDWOOD! It's going to be $100+ to fix it, and I, like another reviewer above, didn't know whether to have it repaired or buy a different tool. However, after reading the other negative reviews and reports of motor failure, I am convinced that this tool doesn't belong in a professional woodshop."
1,Chalk up another Burnt Motor,"Just adding to the LONG list of people who bought this router and watched it burn up after little to moderate use. I had mine for 3 yrs and am not a pro. THis router only saw occasional use over 3 yrs. The ring broke (as soon as the warrentee ran out of course)....made a ton of noise but kept running for a while. Then the lightning storm on the top and motor fried. Stunk up the whole house and now Im stuck with this pile.I have a lot of good tools and thought dewalt was a good brand, but Dewalt has now been added to my 'Never Again' list.I unfortunatly bought the 618 pak with all 3 bases and the nice case...which are now all a huge waste (anybody wanna buy em cheap? email me at [...]Im not going to pay to fix this thing..its a poor design and will only break again down the road.I guess ill buy a Bosch? Avoid Dewalt...maybe they 'used' to be good, but its clear from the experiences on this thread that they build a junk router."
2,Smoked motor and junk spindle lock,I have 4 pieces of Dewalt tools and this is the first piece that I review as near junk. The spindle lock is useless with plastic piece attached to a metal pin. You have to be Hercules to push the pin in and hold it in while trying to tighten the collet. Then if you DO press it in hard enough to tighten collet it has a habit of being bound and not releasing. Absoluite junk design that certainly won't last a weeks worth of work. The best part about it was that it only took 3 screws to remove the whole lock mechanism that will give you better access to using two wrenches. Of coarse Dewalt only provided one wrench so you have to use your own.The more serious problem was that the motor has a lightenig storm inside it brushes. The unit gave out over the coarse of about 30 minutes of ON time over a weekend. The thing sstarted squeeling like a banshee and then it started slowing down in easy material. Back to the depot. Maybe get a Hitachi instead.
1,mobile phone tools,"Does'nt work well, i had the early version of this product[mobile phone tools] thah worked very well. I can't use any thing from my computer, what up. Sucks now."
4,Thorough Public Relations Intro,"I must concede to being a fan of Cutlip's and Broom's work. I was deeply interested to see what they would update and change in this seminal work from their previous edition, most notably anything in the area of extremely cost effective public relations, especially as clients are demanding more and better public relations counsel for less money. While the 8th edition does not disappoint, nor does it rise above all expectations. For one who is a neophyte in the area, then I strongly suggest this work, as it provides one of the most comprehensive overviews of our industry that I have ever seen. For myself, I felt the book needed more coverage in the cost effective area. I found that coverage in Michael Levine's Guerrilla PR: Wired, which addresses the burgeoning need of attaining strong coverage without blowing the budget. Overall then, while I recommend this book, I cannot do so without some reservations. Nonetheless, I look forward to reading the 9th Edition."
2,Academic and systematic introduction to PR,"My titles sums it up. I expected a books that provides me with new insights - nothing like that. It's appeared to me as an analysis of what PR is (or better should), how the job chances, how working day looks like, and so on. For everybody who looks for a practical approach - forget it. But I can recommend the book because of its ton of references."
3,Lucky to get this reasonably priced,"The prices of textbooks are insane, so it was a bargain to find this used and in such good condition."
4,school days,"i purchased this book after returning to night school as the required text. it came a few days after i was expecting, however it was in very good condition, and is helping."
2,From a student's perspective...,"Last year, I took an intro to PR class to see if I'd like it. I loved the class, but our text, Effective Public Relations, was another story. As a college student, I read a lot of textbooks. This one certainly is as they claim: a PR bible, full of essential PR knowledge. But dang if it wasn't the most stimulating, interesting read since late night phonebook reading. Even compared to other textbooks, it was a chore to read."
1,Very out of date.,"I have been a guinea pig owner for a while now and having done hours or research online and with other books I bought this book hoping to learn more ,seeing as it had all 5 star reviews. It turns out this book is very out of date on proper guinea pig care and is filled with what is now considered wrong and misleading information on proper care for your cavy. While some of the information still stands to be true far too much of it is not.I would not recommend this book to anyone."
1,Uh...will this get funny soon?,"I'm flabbergasted by this cd. It's really kind of joke-free. It seems to be about a guy named Sean Rouse talking about the horrible abuse he suffered at the hands of his parents and about how he takes a lot of drugs and drinks a lot now. Subject matter that could be funny if Sean was at all likable, or there were jokes delivered instead of just ugly improvised statements made, and then some laughter. I showered, but I still feel like I've been dipped in a vat of chewing tobacco spit.If this is your thing, seek help, and bring Sean Rouse with you."
5,An excellent compilation,"""Panis Angelicus"" indeed stirs a spirit of devotion for the Angelic Bread which has been given to us by Christ. This CD is an excellent compilation of hymns which are especially devoted to the Eucharist. Utilizing more traditional hymns, ""Panis Angelicus"" helps one reflect on the mystery of Jesus' presence in the Eucharist.The Latin hymns chosen for this CD are familiar to many. If they aren't, they quickly will become familiar, for they are the hymns which withstood the test of time. They have been utilized in devotion for hundreds of years and are indeed the best of the Church's Hymns.The English hymns on this CD are also familiar. While they are not as old as the Latin hymns, they are still beautiful and are the pinnacle of English Church hymns.All in all, I have found that the selection of hymns on this CD, both Latin and English, help to bring me into a deeper devotion to the Real Presence of Jesus in the Eucharist by means of a more traditional spirituality."
5,I love these old Catholic Hymns.,I love the old Latin hymns and this CD is full of them. The Kochis's have excellent voices for the performance of these old classics. I know that part of my enthusiasm is just the rarity of their performance in my home church but I still give them 5 stars.
2,"Ok for a beginner, but lacks in advanced functions","Pros-1.) Works good for someone who only needs basic functions such as date book, expense, etc.2.) Compatible with Mac and PC, also can connect to other Palm Pilots via infrared transfer.Cons-1.) Black and white screen.2.) Only 2 MB of memory. This is ok if you only use the basic functions of the unit, but if you install other applications it tends to start bogging it down.3.) Unreliable battery. The battery lasted quite a while when I first got the unit, but after about a year of using it, it got to where now the charge only lasts for approx. 1 hour.Conclusion:This PDA is ok for a beginner or someone who needs basic functions, but if you are looking for a hard working PDA, invest a little more and get a better one."
3,Great Price...Limited Memory,I really liked how light and small this was but it was limited to 2MB of memory and was B&W. With the release of this PDA at its time really was a bummer. All the PDA's on the market were Color so the applications you could download were limited. Also the was only 2MB of memory and you couldn't expand. If it was released a year ealier it woulda been way more useful.
4,Very Happy,"This is my first PDA, very easy to understand and use. Perfect for someone on the go who needs organization. A lot of internal space and is compatible with most computers. It's lightweight and very portable, not bulky.The only thing I wish was different,was that it had LED backlighting. Otherwise, very nice for the price. I recommend this one!"
1,Unreliable,"I need a palm to have my calander and address book on hand at all times. This model proved to be extremely inefficient. The lack of backlighting meant that often I could not see what was on the screen and it's memory would empty from one moment to the next. I would be stuck with no calander or address book. I contacted the company by email and the only advice they had was to keep the Palm seperate from my cell phone. This I did, to no avail, the Palm continues to discharge it's memory.I have now discharged the Palm into the rubbish bin and will not purchase another!"
4,pda newbie,"I bought this product for my hubby but decided I had to open it to find out how it worked. For a pda starter it worked great, the instructions were clear and with illustrations too. It was easy to get started. If you are looking for something that's just to be used for notes, address book, and to do list, this is great. It also has a game that helps you to learn the graffiti used by the palm. That helped a lot and was fun too. After I started getting to know it and learning online what pdas can do and all the programs available for it, the memory size (2 mb) was way too small. The plastic ""cover"" that comes with it is more of a burden than useable. The rechargeable battery and clear on screen battery meter makes it easy to use as soon as you charge it up. For the really novice and non techie, it's a great product for a great price. But the more you use it and find out the other programs available for it like Bible Reader, ebooks, pda cookbook, you definitely want an expandable pda."
1,No backlight? I clicked cancel order,"As a fan of the Palm OS, I was going to buy a few of these Zire units as xmas gifts to friends. I knew they only had 2MB of RAM and while that is a pretty small amount, it's still OK because Palm programs don't use up much memory. But when I read there is no backlight, I immediately ditched the idea. Just what is Palm thinking by releasing a model with no backlight? They should price this unit at half the price, then it may be worthwhile to get, but at $99 this unit just does not cut it. Pay a few dollars more and you can get a Sony Clie with 8MB and full backlight, plus a memory expansion slot."
1,Horrible!,"Worked for 3months, then stylus just never registered again! Horrible device! This was my first Palm -- and my last. I'm switching to PocketPC!"
2,Unsatisfied,"I had a lot of problems getting the PDA to ""sync"" up with my laptop (in order to transfer addresses, callender, etc). Customer Service was an absolute nightmare. Over the course of a week, I spoke to four representatives. Each of them was barely able to speak English and was unable to solve the problem. Each call lasted about 30 minutes.....Once the rep realized that he/she didn't know how to fix the problem, I was put on hold for 10-20 minutes then eventually disconnected. The PDA ifself is satisfactory, but I had such a wretched experiance with their service that I will never buy another Palm product again."
4,close,"this palm is the most up to date handheld for under 100 dollars. This is not a palm for those who want to store alot of games. it is great for 1st time users, and those who want to use it for organization,and on the go storage/text entry.Over all it is a good purchase."
2,Maybe if it was $75,"Even [$] is a little much for this little PDA. The screen is small, and there is little space for additional applications with only 2MB RAM. The rechargeable batteries are nice, but spend just a *little* more and get a PDA with a little more oomph. Palm should either beef up the features a little or lower the price a little."
3,"A good Palm, but worth the money?","I got a Palm Zire during the summer. It was my first Palm, and enjoyed it for a little while. But I got a look at all the other ones out there, and it made me think twice. for only (a bit) more, I could have gotten one with color and 16 meg of memory!(Sony Clie SJ22) The Zire, with only four buttons, is not ideal for playing most palm games out there. Also the two megabytes it comes with won't be enough for alot of programs, such as word processers. Its monochrome display has no backlight, and this can be frustrating. However, if you want a Palm just to keep phone numbers and notes, and maybe an alarm, this palm is the cheapest one you can get."
1,Broke after 100 days! Pathetic warranty!,"Hey. I am obsessed with gadgets so my parents got me this for my birthday. It was so cool. I kept track of all my chores, school schedules, phone numbers, and could play games. It ruled. [bad] as it is, this palm only has a 90-day warranty. After about 100 days, mine stopped working. Totally died! ... So save your money, and buy something better!"
4,Great PDA for the beginner on a budget,"I recently bought this and I love it. I was able to get rid of my bulky address book. I was looking for a basic PDA and the Zire is it. Easy to use and fun to learn all the quirks etc. Best of all the price is right for someone on a tight budget. Only drawback is it is not backlit, other than That I love it. Might have been nice to have a memory expansion card, but I can live with what this has."
1,A little too basic,"I received this as a gift. Since I am a first time PDA user . . . had been entertaining the idea of purchasing one . . . I was excited until I saw how little this one does. Not enough memory and bells and whistles for me.I think it is okay for someone that may just want an address book and ""to-do"" list, but as a business person, I want a greater ability to add some software applications.The price reflects the old adage, ""you get what you pay for."""
4,Good oportunity to take,"Palm hit the point with this incredible product. I think Palm could find, before any other handheld company, the big part of the market that hasnt been exploted yet.About the product... Very easy to use and comfortable. You can keep it in your pocket like if you are taking anything.The price rocks, and the style looks pretty nice.In my opinion, Zire will reach people!"
2,Small PDA with Big Problems,"It's small size, cool look and Palm pedigree made me buy this. Sadly, the screen was very very small and the stylus rather flimsy. What really hurts this product is the inability of the software to recognize the Palm writing, 'graffiti'. Almost 80% of what I wrote was recognized incorrectly. After using Palm's for 6 years I expected more. I spent enormous time correcting entries. Had to return it. Unless you have a lot of patience, upgrade to the next level."
4,Great Starter,I really like this product. It is fairly easy to learn. The instructions could be better but the e-mail support is excellent. This is my first PDA & I mainly need one for events & addresses. I like the look of it & it does all I wanted & more. I do not feel I need a back light & can see the display fine. Easy to download to from the internet for games & such. Nice shape & size. Can't beat it for the price. Get the case also. You will want it to carry in your purse.
4,Love this little baby!,"As a first-time PDA owner, I couln't recommend this product more. It has an easy-to-use interface with logical ""Graffiti"" handwriting interpretation abilities. My husband and I can ""beam"" contacts and appointments back and forth to keep our schedules coordinated. It's packed with features and has plenty of memory for basic downloaded applications. I don't need all the bells and whistles (and this model doesn't have them...color, web access, etc.), so this price was great for everything I need."
4,I Love It!,"I am a stay at home Mom with a busy schedule and a large address book. I needed something to organize my life a bit. The Zire did just that! I love it and I use it all the time. If you only need it to jot down notes, keep appointments and as an address book...it's ideal... and the 2 MB of memory is plenty! I debated whether or not to get the Zire 21 instead- mainly because of the memory (the 21 has 8 MB)and I think I made the right choice. My only complaint about it is the cover. It doesn't stay open and it only protects the screen. Regardless...it's one of the best purchases I've ever made.For someone thinking of buying a PDA for similar purposes as I need it for...I would recommend this one."
2,No backlight!!!,"This product would be great except for one thing: no backlight. I don't know about you, but I often find the need to use a device like this under low-light conditions. No backlight makes it far less useful for me. (With a backlight you can, for example, read e-books in bed without disturbing your spouse, etc.) Just think about it before you buy . . ."
3,There's a better handheld out there for the same price!,"The palm Zire is overall an ""okay"" handheld, but if you shop around, I know you'll get more bang for your buck. The Zire has some good points to it, like packing a newer OS verison 4.1, new design as opposed to other Palm Handhelds, and a rechargable battery. But it lacks many basic features that everyone needs! For example, there is no backlight on the Zire, so forget about using the handheld in dim or dark light. It also had a 16MHz processor, so if you plan editing a spreadsheet or playing a game, your performance will be a slower than with other higher priced handhelds. Also, the Zire has only 2MB of RAM, so plan on keeping only contacts and To Do lists. I prefer keeping a E-Book on my handheld with takes up 2-3MB of data. Overall, the zire is an okay handheld I'm sure once the price comes down, the Zire will be the ultimate handheld for the first time user."
3,A Very Basic Unit,"The Good: It's cheap. It has recharagable batteries. It's basic. It's cheap.The Bad: It's cheap. It's basic. The rubber cover is next to worthless, and annoying as well. And if you keep it in your pocket or a crowded pocket book, it can easily turn on. So you are recharging it very often. It's very basic. And it's very cheap."
2,Great for minamal porpuses,"This is the best palm... only if you are a kinda busy person, with kinda alot of phone calls to make, and stuff like that.105, is way better though. Because it is obsolete you can get it for really cheap prices, have 4 times as much memory, the same blck and white screen, the same sized screen, and a graet for holdin in your hand"
1,zire palm disappointing,"I purchased a zire palm this past January. It has been nothing but a big disappointment to me. If given the opportunity I would not purchase it again, I would spend a little more and get a better palm."
5,Great for those who don't want bells and whistles,"Ignore the power users who complain about no buttons for games or no backlight. The Palm Zire does what I want it to do: it has an addressbook and calendar that are easy to use and work well. The absence of the backlight and other stuff means it's very light and easily fits in my pocket, and the trickle charging battery means no problems with charging up. And 2 megs is more than enough for someone with modest needs. One tip: you can buy another mini-USB cable for ten bucks and use it for your work or home computer, so you can easily hotsync to both."
1,Useless as phone book,"If you want to buy this to store phone numbers, don't. If it is placed near a cell phone, all memory is erased! Palm is aware of this and is still selling them while they look for a way to fix them. They don't know how to fix them yet. Their solution? Keep it away from all cell phones. What a joke. The only reason I give it 1 star is because 0 stars is not an option."
2,could have been better,"This palm really disapoints me. I need a lot of memory for addresses and notes and this palm just doesnt work for me. For the price, Its kinda [inexpensive] and if you want a real palm for... more, get the m500"
2,Before you buy this,"BEFORE you buy the Zire, look at the Sony CLIE PEG SL10. The Sony CLIE PEG SL10 is a better unit because it has 8MB of memory and it has a backlit display. Just like the Zire, the Sony CLIE PEG SL10 is affordable."
5,Palm Zire,"...this is a total bargain. I bought a Zire for my fiance, she thinks the Zire is very cool and easy to use. She is not a tech geek, but took no time figuring how to use this palm. ... the device looks decent, and if you want a basic organizer, I thouroughly recommend this. If you want something that will take photos, buy your plane tickets, organize your sock drawer and improve your love life, shell out for it. If you are budget minded and don't need the lastest and greatest, save your $$ for something else, and spend less ... for this solid unit."
2,Never got the chance,"I ordered this and then cancelled my order after I played with it in the store. It has a very small screen and is hard to read. The color is also white, which I thought was pretty tacky. I ended up getting the Sony Clie and I love it... much better!!"
2,Beware the warranty!,"The Palm Zire is a great entry-level handheld. However, I question the Zire's planned product life. The Zire only comes with a 90 day manufacturer's warranty, as opposed to the one year warranty on all other Palm handhelds and most personal electronics. The display stopped working on the Zire I purchased about two weeks after the warranty expired. It was still in excellent condition otherwise.If you have not purchased an extended service plan, the repair costs and shipping are practically enough to buy another Zire.This may have been an isolated incident, but be aware of your service options before investing in a product that may fail shortly after it's sub-standard warranty period."
3,"Palm and Amazon, not a match made in Heaven","I like my Palm Zire, but I can't hotsync it because the cable was missing, when shipped.Amazon says its Palm's problem and Palm says Amazon owes me one.So who stinks more?"
4,Inexpensive and durable!!,The Zire has really helped keep me organized. It is a good starting place if you're interested in PDAs. I accidentally dropped it outside during a rainstorm and didn't find it until the next morning. I thought it was ruined because it wouldn't turn on. I went home and tried to charge it up. An hour later I checked it and what do ya know...it worked!! It reset all of my info. Luckily I had most of it backed up on my computer. So make sure you sync it everyday or at least on every couple of days. All in all this a great product for the money you will pay for it.
2,I got a Palm Zire.,I got a Palm Zire. I got it because it is a PDA that is not expensive. But unfortunately it is a bad PDA. Let me to tell you why: It has a bad screen very dark no light. It is boring. It is dull. Small memory and limited usefulness because it has a weak alarm. I don't like it. Even though it is cheap it is not worth it.
1,works great for 95 days - but only a 90 day warranty,"I was really happy with my Zire until last week. After 95 days, the thing will not synchronize with any of the PCs that it used to work with. I am disgusted to find out that there is only a 90 day warranty. I should have expected that since it's one of the cheapest (price) on the market that it would be one of the cheapest (quality) as well. I have been rooting for Palm in their battles with ...Microsoft CE-based products, but now I'm going to have to admit that staying with Palm was a huge mistake. My kids are now happy because they now have a new toy, and I'm going to go shopping for a better unit- and I guarantee it won't be another Palm product. You know the old saying ""burn me once, shame on you; burn me twice, shame on me."" Well I don't intend to give them a chance to burn me with their shoddy quality again."
2,Lame compared to new PDAs,"I got one of these as a gift. It is easy to use and works OK, but is really low tech compared to the newer PDAs. The screen is hard to read in low light and is low resolution. Battery life is good, however.If you want a cheap black and white pda, at least get a Sony with the high resolution screen for another $30."
2,Decent product - horrible support!,"I bought this Palm as a cheap contact manager - that's what I got - I knew what I was getting into. However, a word regarding Palm support...After a couple months - the screen went completely black and I needed to call tech support. What a nightmare. It's obvious to anyone that Palm has exported its help desk overseas (India most likely). The five different support engineers I talked to ALL had very thick accents, could not understand simple English sentences, could not make logical decisions (they follow a very formal script) and made the whole experience VERY frustrating, time consuming and expensive (they don't have a toll-free number anymore). The point is simple - sooner or later you're probably going to call tech support for help - and in my opinion, the ""help"" desk at Palm is horrible!"
5,A must-have for every math whiz,"The alternate approaches and detailed solutions bring excitement to math, up through grad level concepts. The discussion is appropriate for middle and high school students, and beyond."
2,Imagine a book on spirituality written by a lady who used to run a yarn shop,"If you're curious, check this one out for the library. It's definitely not a ""keeper.""This book was a complete disappointment.The author has little spiritual practice of her own. So as a reader if feels like she's read some of the same books I have, and is making connections between them, but not particularly deep or significant ones.The patterns are mostly for junk nobody wants or needs. As opposed to something useful or beautiful. I swear, I'd rather have one more pattern for a damn chemo cap than this ugly knitted spiral onto which you can sew charms from the craft store. (There is a really basic shawl included almost as an afterthought, and that may be the one thing I try to make.)If you're interested in knitting as a spiritual practice, look elsewhere. I'm going to give Mindful Knitting and Knitting the Mystery a try."
2,One Odd Book,This is one odd knitting book. I thought it would enlighten me about knitting and spirituality. Not so. I am forcing myself to finish it and I keep hoping I will come to a part that will get better. I wish I hadn't bought it.
4,Took a while to sync in the organization of the book,"At first I thought I wasn't going to like the book.But then after I read it from beginning to end the organization and flow of the book took hold.I don't think I'll do the knitting projects because I'm a fairly experienced knitter, and the projects don't really challenge me, but the reflections and references to other books and thoughts I found useful."
4,Good book!!!,"I get this book for my wife, she told me is a very good accountingmaterial for medium level, but in the next edition if they add a CD with information to work with.is going to be excellent,"
1,"Too Much Gimmick, Not Much Substance","The theory of this book is that you can get through 1 chapter (concept) in one hour, then you take a quiz when your hour's up to make sure you got the concepts.The quizes are poorly worded. Any question that an ""all-of-the-above"" option, was ALWAYS ""all-of-the-above"". Worse than that is that the answers were in the back of the book with NO EXPLAINATION. Please at least tell me why ""b"" was the correct answer.I think the book brushed over some of the essential accounting concepts, while focusing on less important topics.I wish I would have never written in this book, but I guess I'm stuck with it now..."
4,Very good guide to accounting,"I read it after I read the Complete Idiot's Guide, so I might be overrating it slightly, but it answered almost all of my questions. I would recommend getting both books.They're ideal for a small business owner who wants to save a little money--it's a lot cheaper to do the books yourself and have a professional accountant review your work than it is to hire one full time."
1,Worked great but not for long,"My B&D D5000 just died. I have had this iron only two years. The alarm sounded and the digital read out was flashing, so I unplugged it. Then I smelled an electrical burn odor, like another reviewer mentioned. Up until now, it was a great iron, but now I need to borrow one to finish my sewing project. (Doesn't it always happen when you are down to crunch time?) It will be difficult for me to buy another B&D iron even though I had previously used a B&D F520 for about twenty years."
4,I liked this movie...,"I saw this movie decades ago and I liked it a lot as a young man;and I saw it about a year ago and I still liked it. It is oneof those movies were a group of people follow the steps ofan adventurer who either never comes back or does come back butmakes wild claims that almost no one beleives, e.g., KingSolomon's Mines,Journey to the Center of the Earth, The LostWorld."
2,Went nowhere,"This film has your typical Duke character we all love to watch but the script went nowhere. Too bad. When the subject is looking for a lost city of gold in the Sahara, you would think the adventerous possibilities are endless but there is not one action sequence the whole movie. See Treasue of the Sierra Madre for a good gold flix. See this out of curiosity or respect for the Duke!"
3,Lost and Lurid,"John Wayne transplants his usual hard-bitten ""western"" loner character to Timbuktu and the Sahara. This makes for some strikingly bright and colorful cinematography. John Wayne's character remains a mystery, however, which might have added some much-needed content to this film if it had been brought out more, perhaps through allusions to past events in the dialogue. At one point, we discover that Wayne's character can read Latin-- a revelation rich in possibilities, indeed. Instead, we find the relationship between Wayne and Sophia Loren (as a Berber runaway-waif and bar-girl) unclear, to say the least, which makes Loren's hook-up with a sophisticated French adventurer (Rossano Brazzi) less intriguing than it might have been if we knew more.The three of them take donkeys, not camels, into the Sahara on a wild goose search for a lost civilization and treasure, with plenty of three-way interactions, some philosophizing, and, ultimately, a tragic ending."
1,A Total Disaster,"LEGEND OF THE LOST is a total wipe-out. Not a single redeemable sequence in this absurd tale of buried treasure out in the desert. What were Wayne and Sophia Loren thinking, signing on for this tripe? And director Henry Hathaway had been around for decades, couldn't he see the train wreck this was? Even the unintentional howlers aren't enough to keep you awake. Simply dreadful!"
5,Excelent,"This product is accord of specification, This product is accord of specification, This product is accord of specification, This product is accord of specification"
3,CSI:Miami,Waste of time for me. Love the show but has no English subtitles on later seasons and I am hearing impaired.
4,This season was the beginning of wonderfull show,I love CSI Miami this season is not my favourite but you can see it coming.
5,Sequences for Yoga,"If you are a devoted Iyengar student, and would like to start self/home practice, the sequences at the back of this book are detailed and excellent. For a less intensive sequencing program, refer to Yoga - the Iyengar Way by Mira Metha."
5,Light on Yoga,I loved this book! It is a necessary addition to anyone interested in examining yoga thouroughly. Mr. Iyengar's prose builds lessons in class and commands meditative attention.
3,Hmmmmm,"Very good beginning to the book. However the author goes on to list all the different positions and what they do for the body, there is however very little cited information from where all this knowledge comes from. I understand he is a master of yoga but many of the things he professes about the different positions only a doctor would be able to know. I'd like to be able to see who validated all the information. Other than that good read, very helpful!"
2,Okay,"What I find disturbing on this book is the realy small explanation lines. It is to much info on one page... It realy is tiring to read this book. You need big glasses to read.. So although I have not completed it, I will probably not finish reading it. Because of its printing and foto's. I think it is a pitty. Because Iyengar has good books."
1,old yoga style,"Even though this book forms the basis for one of the foundations of yoga. I hate this book because the information in it is outdated and the pictures of the the demonstrated poses are ugly to look at. It's an old paperback book with ugly looking pictures. There are much better yoga books written for example by Rodney Lee, and current authors who paint a much lighter view of yoga that is easy to follow and easy to learn.Light on Yoga: The Bible of Modern Yoga..."
5,Unbelievably useful,"If you are taking yoga on as a serious study you must get this book!! It's like a yoga bible. The intro alone will set you on a path of a new and complete understanding of the philosophy of this age old practice. Then to boot - you have a complete pictorial compilation of all the postures with descriptions of each and the breathing techniques.Don't worry about it being written by Iyengar himself if you intend on practicing other branches of yoga - this book was recommended to me by a well known and respected Vinyasa instructor, Marco Rojas. I work mostly in Ashtanga and Yin/Yan yoga. Seriously, this book will set you on your way regardless of how you ultimately choose to practice."
4,Not for Beginners,"I bought this book for my friend who just started doing yoga. She was just a beginner and many of the stretches and poses in this book are for the more advanced. Some of them are just plain impossible for the average person. Great book if you're a master yogi, not if you're just getting started."
3,Nice but Harmful?,"I practiced Iyengar Yoga according to this book and with instruction of good teachers, but found that the book leaves out some crucial aspects of yoga, while emphasising some aspects of posture/asana that may make the practice too mechanical. It is fine to learn good alignment, but it is important to note that what is in the heart is more important than how the posture looks from the outside. A good book to balance this one is Mark Whitwell's ""Yoga of Heart,"" which describes the importance of the goal of yoga- integrating your life- as well as the importance of 1) a regular simple daily practice, 2) understanding how to gauge what YOUR body should and can do from day to day."
4,OK,"The book was what I ordered and Amazon delivered perfectly. However, the book itself is jammed into too small of a space. Hard to read and seemed stuffy."
5,The one that started it all!,"Setting the stage for the for the modern explosion of yoga was this book, ""Light on Yoga."" In this book B.K.S Iyengar gives us a detailed overview of hatha yoga as we know it today. Included are sections on yoga philosphy, asanas, pranayama, practice sequences and the application of yoga for health issues. The asana section is the most complete instructional listing of asanas I have ever seen: some easy and some very challenging. In either case Iyengar shows us what the human body is possible of doing in yoga. This book is a classic, a great reference tool for both students and teachers, and a copy belongs in every yogi's library.Howard VanEs, author ofAgeless Beauty & Timeless Strength: A women's guide to building upper body strength without any special equipment"
3,Not for beginners,The book doesn't explain about the poses enough. How do I breathe through some of the poses? How long should I hold a pose or do I hold it all. It is very comprehensive but I don't think anbody is going to all those poses. I would recommend getting some easier books.
1,type too small to read,I have the original hardback of this book and took a chance and ordered the paperpack...unfortunately the type is much to small to read and I had to return it. I do wear glasses but my vision is not poor and do not have trouble reading.
2,Experts Only!,"This book is essentially a reference text book on Yoga. In that regard, it is totally comprehensive and complete. However, I bought it on a recommendation from an acquaintance who said it was a great book to get started with yoga. It is certainly NOT THAT!!! I am a beginner yoga student and if you are or similar you could hurt yourself trying many of the poses in this book. Further, the book doesn't progress from easy poses to more difficult ones but rather skips from advanced to easy back to advanced, etc. I would NOT recommend this book if you are a beginner or are looking for a simple intro to yoga. Just looking at some of the poses hurt me."
2,Trained Photocopier Wanted,"This is the fifth book I have purchased from MOML as a photocopy of a book outside of the copyright protection time frame. Three were acceptable but had many pages that demonstrated that the person conducting the photocopying process was inattentive and allowed some pages to be nearly unreadable. One book was sent twice and only had a handful of pages indicating that MOML has little quality control over its products. This book ""A Treatise on the Principles of Pleading"" from the Yale Law School Library has some pages with handwritten notes which were carefully photocopied. It also has many pages that are such poor copies that they are unreadable. Although the MOML concept could be a useful source of out of print publications, the company's extremely poor quality control makes its products generally inferior and sometimes unusable."
4,Great,"Anbody that has ever cooked with cast Iron .or on A Grill , this will brink both of those methodsin one piece of Equioment"
3,not crazy about the enamel,"First off, I disagree with everyone here who says this pan is difficult to clean. Every time Ive grilled whole fish in it, theyve stuck so Ive had to soak and scrape. Not hard.But for the same reason that its easy to clean, its screwing up the fish in the first place. Its the enamel. When youre grilling a fish, or most other meats, you want to have them make contact with the grill when its very hot, so that the meat contracts enough to not bind to the surface. Ive found that no matter how hot I get the grill, and Ive had it over a high flame for 45 minutes before putting a fish on it, its just not hot enough.But I keep it around because its great with anything thats not as delicate as a whole fish. Burgers, veggies, paninis, chops, love it."
3,LeCreuset Grill Pan,"As others have said before me, this pan does not clean up anywhere near as easily and as clean as the other fry pans I have in this set. It smokes, also. I don't know why they had to put that different surface on this grill pan as opposed to the other regular fry pans they make?"
1,Don't buy this!,"I love Le Creuset enameled pots and got this as part of a package, however it does not behave like the enameled cookware, as others mentioned it's extremely hard to clean, everything sticks even after seasoning it and oiling it, I believe it's not even made at the original factory in France."
4,"NMA does rock, does this?","OK so I've been listening to NMA since the beginning. Yes I had GHOST when it came out, before any of the others. It was awesome. Too bad Customs wouldn't let them into the country to tour. Scaredy cats. They continued to get better and then I lost track of them because chain record stores don't carry them typically. So is this what I should get back into it with? Still thinking about it."
2,John Ford's message film with over-the-hill cast,"Ford gives his take on how law and order came to the western frontier and it is believable if you don't know much history except what you have seen in Westerns. It may also be his answer to High Noon and the theme of one man having to take on outlaws without help from his friends and neighbors. A statehood issue is shoehorned onto this theme. John Wayne is in his usual western character and costume and James Stewart plays his usual B movie character; both are too old for the parts they play; but do give their usual very professional performance. The doctor and newspaperman, as in most westerns, are the town drunks. The plot and subplots are stale, the townspeople are stereotypical of early to mid-20th century westerns. Sadly one scene even confuses the Declaration of Independence with the U.S. Constitution. This movie is vastly over-rated by most reviewers on this site."
5,One of the Greatest Westerns Ever Filmed........,"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is one of John Ford's greatest efforts....maybe his his last great film. John Wayne, James Stewart, Vera Miles, Lee Marvin and a stellar supporting cast from the John Ford ""stock company"" combine their efforts for a fabulous movie. The film is beautifully restored to a pristine print and this wonderful blu ray does it justice!"
4,Subtitles Lacking,"Great movie but I feel sorry for anyone who has to use the subtitles. One of the best lines in the movie is botched by whoever was responsible for transcribing the dialog to text. Peter, the foreigner who becomes an American Citizen in the course of the movie, tries to use an American idiom but gets it wrong. Instead of saying that someone is going to ""upset his apple cart"", Peter calls it a ""Wagon apple."" A very humorous line. Apparently, whoever was doing the subtitles did not get the joke and neither will anyone who relies on those subtitles. In the subtitles, Peter's ""wagon apple"" has become, ""bag of apples."" If you love dialog in movies like this, leave the subtitles turned off."
5,Not a fan of Westerns? You will be...,"From amidst the plethora of available Hollywood Western titles emerge a relatively few notables: this is one, and Number One on my personal list. Each character is cast and enacted with serene perfection. The screenplay is without flaw. The cinematography, direction, etc... It will create in you a true love for The Western, single-handedly. If that love is already there, and you haven't seen this movie...where have you been?"
5,"A Great Movie, Pilgrim!","When the Duke tells Stewart to ""think back, Pilgrim"" (or something to that effect) you know you're gonna be treated to one of the great moments in Cowboy film history...I always laugh to myself when this part comes, 'cause it turns out that even the Duke wasn't so noble...and we know that politician Jim Stewart here in the film, had the truth been actually known, wasn't that much of a hero, either....isn't that the way it is in real life? Subtexted also is a love story, and the old West (settle disputes with bullets) vs the new West (settle disputes with the law)""conflict""... One of my all-time favorites!"
3,what??,This is a fun movie but no 7 on the all time list?????????????who is paying you for this placement??
3,Emperor's New Clothes?,"I am impressed by the passion of the other reviewers but I must say I find most of it poorly shot, poorly paced, and poorly acted by most everybody but Wayne and Strode, with O'Brien giving one of the worst performances recorded on screen. I think this film must teach well. (English professors have come to believe that Bleak House is Dickens' best novel perhaps because it is the most interesting to teach, but not to read). The central idea is catchy and there is a clinging mournfulness to Wayne's fate, with echoes carrying over from ""The Searchers"". But I just can't see how anybody can prefer this to ""My Darling Clementine"", which many notable critics do. Because the movie is quite memorable, it is mistaken for being good."
4,"I'm Really Not a Fan of Westerns, But............","John Ford's ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" is a marvelous movie, regardless of how you feel about Westerns. This isn't a movie about outlaws, or something violent, but a study of the fight between old and new in our society. John Wayne's rugged cowboy represents the old, untamed west. Jimmy Stewart's refined and educated lawyer represents the order and civilized nature of a new west. Both clearly love the land they live on in different ways, and when the time comes to protect the people of the west from the evil Liberty Valance (played to perfection by Lee Marvin), they team up to save the day. In the end, Stewart's way of life, the way of progress, wins out. However, as can be seen by the memories the major characters have at the start of the film, the old west never really dies. The movie is just brilliant, with all the leads in top form, especially the forgotten Vera Miles as the woman both Wayne and Stewart love."
5,"Old West 1, Civilization 0","Truth be told, pilgrim, Doniphon was more like Valence than he was like the pencil-necked bookworm played by Stewart, who was more like Vera Miles. (Two ironies come to mind: First, it was Doniphon himself--not law books, women or Stewart's lawyer--who paved the way for civilization, by killing Valence and letting Stewart take the credit. Second, in real life (if movie fans care) Stewart risked his life in WW II bombers over Germany while Wayne stayed at home with a deferment.) One quibble: I wish the studio would use Gene Pitney's song as the theme."
5,john wayne is the true hero of this movie,"I loved this movie. John Wayne sacrifices his heart and his pride and turns a territory into a state. Great acting all around, especially Lee Marvin as a despicable gunslinger. Still, John Wayne emerges as the true hero of this movie."
5,Great Classic Movie!,This is one of the finest westerns made. The black and white film gives it an even older feel. Lee Marvin plays one of the greatest screen villains ever!
5,Great even for the girls,"I do not normally like westerns but Jimmy Stewart is becoming one of my favorite actors, including in the westerns. This movie has much suspense and is not boring. It keeps you engaged in it and has some very lovely romance too. What surprised me, however, was that the movie began with the end and went back to the beginning to tell the whole story. That you need to know, but it is a very good movie."
4,The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (Paramount Centennial Collection),Another favourite and very enjoyable movie. Perfect for a lazy Sunday afternoon's entertainment to simply relax and enjoy. Thank you.
1,A parody,"This is an unintentional parody of the Western movie. The cliches, stereotypes, corny lines, and macho nonsense are present in abundance. There are signs of trouble from the beginning, when we learn immediately that there will be a flashback: Jimmy Stewart is shouting his lines. Later, John Wayne swaggers and sniggers, Andy Devine whimpers and attempts to be amusing, Edmund O'Brien does an awful drunk act, things are rowdy in the local saloon...well, you understand if you're over 13. Watch how fast Stewart recovers from a savage beating after he sips some brandy. And don't miss the by now obligatory civil rights salute. The ending is wholly predictable. My educated guess is that John Ford, Lee Marvin, and many others on the set were tipping the bottle a bit too much. This is a dreadful, if often quite funny, film. It was Ford's worst, Stewart's worst, and ranks at least fourth from the bottom in Wayne's career."
4,Print The Legend,"John Ford hits on all cylinders, Lee Marvin plays a classic bad guy, and John Wayne plays the stereotypical John Wayne character in a very non-stereotypical manner in THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE.Wayne plays the same basic character he'd played in so many other westerns. But, instead of being the young stud settling the Wild West, Wayne plays an aging dinasaur, his kind of justice increasingly unwanted and outdated. Easily Wayne's best performance.Stewart and Miles are good, though a bit of the lovey-dovey glazed looks could have been edited out, as far as I'm concerned.To me the best performance here comes from Lee Marvin. His Liberty Valance is a dirty, slimey, bullying psychopath. Brilliantly done.But who decided to give the bad guy a goofy name like Liberty Valance? Sounds like an 18th century piece of furniture."
5,This trilogy is excellent.,"Other than the White Mountains trilogy, this is Christopher's best work. It is set in a future where all technology, science, and machines are outlawed, and the past has been wiped out by wars and natural disasters. The main character becomes the prince of a small city-state. The books are filled with exciting fight scenes, unusual concepts, and the struggle of a boy who is burdened with the duty to rule. I would highly recommend this book to any fan of science fiction, and in particular any fan of the White Mountains trilogy or John Christopher."
5,Plastic Surgery with a twist,"I don't usually think of plastic surgeons as subject matter for medical thrillers, but the author of this book does an excellent job of convincing me it is possible. I am a sucker for medical thrillers and when they are well written, I have a hard time putting them down. Gilder combines enough medical information to satisfy me with enough suspense to keep me going. I enjoyed this novel thoroughly and recommend it highly. If you're a fan of Robin Cook or Michael Crichton, you'll love Gilder."
2,The guy cried at least a dozen times....too sensitive for me,"I bought the book because of the reviews I read on this site. I did not like the book. There were some hanging parts, action parts that I scoffed at and the guy didn't have the ego that a surgeon has especially plastic surgeons. I just don't understand how the other reviewers liked it so much. I almost didn't finish it. I actually put it down for a few days and picked it up only to see if something near the end would draw me in more. It didn't. The guy I really liked was a black detective with blue eyes. He was interesting for a bit."
3,unabridged audio,"See book description above.I must be missing out on something by not reading the book, but the unabridged audio did not satisfy me in the least. The protagonist, Jackson Maebry, seemed very naive. His obsession with Allie made him look like a schmuck. I did not care at all what happened to him, for that matter, I didn't care what happened to anyone in this story. Borriinnng.I have a feeling if I'd have started the book I would not have finished it.Patrick Girard Lawlor does a good job with the narration."
5,Fast Remover,I liked this polish remover because it removed layers of polish that other nail polish removers did not remove. I did not have to work as hard to remove it like I did with the other polish removers.
5,great gun!,"Im a 13 year old paintball player. I have had four guns (a brass eagle, two 98 custom, and the a5) Firts, the a5 starts out as a great marker, but the barrel, sight, e-grip and stock add the extra power that makes this my favorite marker. The only trouble ive had is that the gun is a little heavy for a 115 pound, 5'3"" 13 yearold. The flatline is great for distance, and is worth the money. It takes a little getting used to, because the balls tend to sink, then rise up again. I bought the retract-stock, and noticed that i couldnt see through the scope without extending the stock or lean over so that the tanki is on my belly button. when you get this gun BUY THE E_GRIP! it is deffinetly better than the stock, wich felt un natural. Also, use air, or you will be out of co2 very quickly (this gun fires fast!) overall ,great gun, get the e-grip!"
1,shitty,"Very unhappy, the product I recieved did not have the items promised in the product description. It was supposed to have the ricon-alpha-9 flashlight worth over 500.00$, instead they gave me a 10.00$ cheap maglight and when I called them on it they refused to make it right. Instead told me I could either live with it or send it back, but they would not make it right so I will now go talk with my lawyer to resolve this matter. VERY UNHAPPY!"
1,phhhhhhhhhhhh!,it's better just to get a rap4 marker (which is magazine fed and what the swat and special millitary units use for training) then spend that much money just to outfit a tippmann a5 with stuff
5,gorgeous and chic,I bought this because my daughter's room was a pale blue and we didn't want to paint it again (as we painted it a year ago). This set is beautiful and very feminine. I get many compliments!
4,Fine product for Beer line cleaning,BLC works well for cleaning the beer lines in my in home Kegerator. i have used it for several years and we are always satisfied with the results
2,Very negative,"This is not a good book. I also am a woman geologist (hydrogeologist)and I am increasingly offended by the whiny, bitter, unsympathetic portrayal of a prototagonist (if that word can be used)who seems unable to pull herself together enough to finish a degree and get and hold a job. Besides these twin destroyers, Em also has unending relationship problems with the men in her life.Finally, the basic premise is silly. Since other reviewers have outlined the plot, I'll just say that the idea that someone would get a totally unqualified geologist (as opposed to, say, an art historian, curator, or someone else who deals with art for a living)to authenticate a painting is rediculous.I found this to be a very negative,pessimistic book. Such a contrast to ""Bone Hunter"", which is a delight to read."
5,Excellent Product,"I have very sensitive skin, and am constantly in the sun and out on the sea sailing. I've tried various brands of sunblock and always ended up with red blotchy and itchy skin.I was abit skeptical when decided to buy Dermalogica Super Sensitive Face Block 30 SPF, but after trying it, I'm very satisfied that my skin does not react to this product. No redness or itchiness even after many hours in the sun. The price may be slighly expensive (for the size), but the natural essential oil used in this product is definitely worth it. Highly recommended for those with sensitive skin."
2,White/chalky complexion,It left a white/chalky complexion. I use it on my hands and neck because it was too expensive to just throw away...
1,Itchy Rash -- Allergic to Product,"Update to my review from May 2011August 9, 2011, After having used the product since May 2011; I would not purchase this product in the future. I am not sure what they put in the ingredients but my skin does not like it. Every time I have used this product, my face breaks out in a very itchy rash. I do not use it on my face because after using it several times and having the same thing occur, I had to discontinue use. By the way, it is certainly not worth the money -- way too expensive.Initial Review on May 2011I usually wait a while before I post a review about a product but I decided to list my initial thoughts. If you have dark brown skin be prepared for a white sheen to appear on your skin. I think this product may break me out but I am going to have to use it a little longer to be certain. As for the seller - excellent!!! I received the product in what seemed like record time. I would definitely purchase from this seller again."
1,poor quality,This pump began knocking in less than 2 months. I called the manufacturer and was told I needed to contact Amazon since that's where it was purchased. I told the manufacturer it was too late to return to Amazon that the manufactureres warranty had to cover it. I was told we would have to remove the pump and drop it off to a repair center that is 40 minutes away and it would be there for who knows how long. Our business cannot afford to be without a compressor for an extended period of time. I would have expected the manufacturer to let us return the part and ship us a new one. We have had alot of problems lately with parts from Campbell Hausfeld going bad within a short period of time.
2,Compressor had no threaded hole for shut off tube,"When I got the compressor the one thing it did not have was pressure relief threaded hole into the head to supply air to the air regulator valve to shut off the compressor when it would have reached max air in the tank.I had to remove the head, drill and tap a threaded hole into the cylinder head to able a air supply cut off tube to the regulator valve. There was a place for it, the factory just did not drill-tap it.Other than that problem compressor seems to be doing well. The over all fit was good.Ron"
2,Well it works.....KINDA,The top half of the pump didnt fit ANY of the original fittings on the Campbell-Hausfeld pump. I ended up having to take the OLD top half and bolt it to the new pump to get the fittings to work...hell the air filter they sent didnt even fit in the new head!!!!!!! fIT PERFECT IN THE OLD HEAD THO....SO AFTER AN HOUR WORTH OF SWAPPING PARTS it works now...and its sort of new...........
3,Uses considerble amount of oil,"Does what it is expected to do, but uses alot of oil. Followed the breakin and it worked fine. Uses more oil than I believe it should. I also have a C-Aire that uses no oil."
3,"Better Than Nothing, But Not Much","This little scanner works. After I got the new drivers, it worked fine with Windows XP. It's a one at a time scanner, and it takes about 5-7 minutes per slide. Problem: It overheats after 3 or 4 slides. You have to turn it off and start over after a half hour or so."
1,I don't work,"What a joke Pacific Image's customer support is. No help, all they say is we are aware of the issues. This was over a year ago. You have been warned"
1,Very disappointed.,The SilverFast SE Software is the worst software I have ever used. The directions a vague and difficult to follow. The program is next to impossible to use. It is very difficult to get any help as it is only available (by phone) while I am at work and costs $1.99 per minute. No response yet from email attempts to get help. DON'T BUY THIS!
2,What's with the organ?,"Ocean breezes and steel drum music absolutely make my Caribbean vacations, so I was thrilled to find this album to I could bring a taste of the tropics to my own backyard.I was so disappointed when I received this album...the sound of the steel drums are completely ruined by the addition of one of those old organs everybody's goofy uncle had in the 60s and 70s. You know the ones...they let you put a samba, bossa nova or fox trot beat over every Billy Joel song you tried to play.It's a shame, because it is a nice selection of songs, but it turns the beautiful tropical music into a kitschy tiki lounge experience instead."
1,So elevator music!,Bought this CD for a Caribbean themed party I was hosting. The music is great if you want to put everyone to sleep! Its like that background music you hear in the elevator! It wasnt as lively as I was looking for! So if you like it soft and mello... then this is for you! If you want lively...try a different one!
1,Amateurish-sounding performance,"The music sounded thin, possibly due to not enough accompanying instruments. The performance on what instruments were there sounded rather amateurish."
4,Nice Steel Drums,"I enjoyed this CD very much and it made for nice background music on a group outing ""boat cruise"". It set the tone nicely."
1,Not Pleased - keep looking,"I read all the review and thought that since this one was made in England, it had to be better. NOT TRUE ... First, it keeps coffee almost at a boil ... so as soon as coffee was done, I upluged it. Second, there were always grinds in the coffee. Third, the pot started leaking from the base after two weeks of use. Totally a bad unit."
1,Dualit Axis - A dangerous product?,"This percolator makes a great pot of coffee. Trouble is, it doesn't stop boiling the coffee after it finishes percolating. Its warm cycle is too robust - makes me think the one I bought is defective or just not completely compatible with 110 current."
1,Dysfunctional Beauty,"This percolator, while beautiful for it's exceptional design, is mechanically flawed .The truth is it leaks profusely during percolating. I even purchased another in hopes thatI received a defective unit, however the new one acted the same.Sincerely, A.G.Stish."
2,Sucks.,"Yes, it does leak from the bottom. Yes, you will be drinking coffee grounds. Not fun for having dropped 100."
2,"Liked the idea of the book, just didn't like the book itself","I was intrigued by the cover description of the book and I generally like Gail Eastwood's book, but this one disappointed me. The historical aspects about the regency times, and about the hero's travels abroad were good, but I just didn't care enough about the plot and the characters. The hero had had previous lovers who had died in suspicious circumstances, and eventually the heroine is in danger as well. The whole plot was just too melodramatic for me to believe in it and get caught up in it. I should have felt sorry for the hero, losing his past loves, but it was hard for me to take the plot seriously. Gail Eastwood is an excellent writer--I just don't think this is one of her best books. Not one for my keeper shelf, although several of her other books have made it there."
2,A HORRIBLE ENDING TO A PROMISING SERIES!,"This series ended so bad it's just not worth reviewing in depth. I am selling the whole series to a used dvd shop tomorrow. What was a great series in the beginning and middle, at its end crashed and burned in such a way that I have no reason to watch this series ever again. Nuff said."
4,A structural Engineer's necessity,Exactly what I needed. It is pretty difficult to review a specification that you must have.
4,Great accessory.,"Did the job very well. Wish it was black, but knew it might be blue. So be it. It Works!"
4,A very thorough treatise on the subject of sex addiction,"The title of this book, ""Back From Betrayal: A Ground Breaking Guide to Recovery For Women Involved With Sex-Addicted Men"", may fool you into believing this book is focused solely on recovery for the co-sex addict.It's not.I waded through a lot of explanations about what sex addiction is and isn't, and what sex addicted men (or women, although the majority of sex addicts are men) think and feel, as well as what leads them to addiction. While this information IS helpful to the co-addict, it was given almost equal time as was the topic of the co-addict and her recovery process.I think this book would have been MORE helpful if it had given more time to the issue of codependency, and women involved in relationships with sex addicts.With that aside, the book is well-written and thorough. You might want to skim the chapters about sex addicts and society and get to the real meat of the issue: co-sex addiction and, especially, recovery."
1,subtle yet relentless condemnation of the victim,"While I never have met the author, I had the impression that she didn't seem to like anyone who was a victim in union with an unfaithful mate. Victims have enough unfair self-blame to deal with, without more unfair damaging blame administered under the disguise of ""help."""
2,Not much to it......,"I agree with a previous reviewer who said that the authors didn't pay much attention to who the target audience was for this book.It starts off like a C++ book, then you have some .NET stuff thrown in (ofcourse, you are not told why you need them, its like ""This is a .NET book, and there has to be some .NET material!!""). I have been programming in C++ for quite long, and I thought I could progress to .NET with this one. I was wrong. The book doesnt even take time off to explain what ""Managed"" C++ is all about. There are some nuggets of info here and there, but its so disorganised, I dont think they will benefit anyone."
5,Excellent Book - Recommended for Intermediate Programmers,"This book is great! It's easy to read and is a great way to learn about the new .NET framework. I recommend this book to any C++ programmers wanting to learn C++.NET. I do not, however, recommend this book to new C++ programmers because it lacks detailed explanations on such beginner subjects (Check out ""Practical C++"" by Rob McGregor for a very complete book to teach you C++).Just like one of the reviewers said, the OOP (Object Oriented Programming) explanation is awesome! I have programmed in Java (ALL OOP) before, and it wasn't until I read this book that I really discovered the greatness behind OOP.Buy it. Read it. Cherish it."
1,Not a step-by-step but an outline book-horrible!,"I agree with the critics--this is not a step by step book but an outline of issues. About a couple of pages per issue. As such, it's useful for an overview, but the title is misdescriptive.This is why it gets one star.The book tries to do too much: chapters 1-5 ""Decision and Loop Statements"" !!! Are you kidding me? Spend the first 83 pages on stuff that programmers should already know?Chapters 6-8: ""Inheritance"", etc. Ditto.Chap 9-12: Value types, Operator Overloading, Arrays and Collections. Stop! you're kidding.Chap 13--Properties (OOP style programming) -- p. 233 - this is where the book should start.Chap 14 - Delegates and Events--usefulChap 15+ Using the .NET framework, etc. Rest of book is good AS AN OUTLINE. A few pages or less are devoted to each topic. Don't expect to learn from this book, just use it to jog your memory and to note your progress as you learn these topics from other sources in the future."
1,The worst disaster in bookwriting EVER!,"This is unbelievable!!! I just bought this book and thought: Ah, I've been out of programming... So this book can get me started in C++ again. No way. As usual with Microsoft in house writing this book looks ok, read ok but the software does not match the book. Yep, it's C++ alright but just try to install the MSDN or try to type in an example.... It all does not work. My occupation is not in the field of programming so I don't have much time to waste on this bull)(*# book. Having programmed in Basic, Pascal 5.5 and machine language (yep it's old but AT LEAST IT WORKED!!!) before I thought to give it a go... What a waste of time indeed!"
2,Stupified,"Being an intermediate C++ programmer myself, I decided to take the venture into the new .NET technology. So, I read through this book expecting quite a bit, but unfortunately was very displeased. In the first few chapters there were two conspicuous errors. The author takes much time to emphasize the case-sensitivty of the C++ language, but himself, makes an error on page 35 on the Reference section..int x = 10;int& y=x;Y = 4; // come on Julian and Andy!This is rediculous. And on page 28, there is a very noticable error. The author takes time to write a program utilizing C++ streams, and in the output the strings are blank!I'm extremely disappointed. I've written better technical articles over the language myself."
3,only if you do programming,Good book but ... does not get you anywhere unless you think you can move to India!
2,No Steps at all,"I've bought most of the MS Visual C++ books. This is the worst of all. If you are new to programming, many of the chapters you won't know what it is talking about."
3,Incomplete Introduction to .Net,"This book is not intended for the beginning C++ programmer. It introduces the .NET Framework Library and Windows Forms, but falls short in the topic of Graphical Output. The reader is most likely looking for some explanation on how to write and read text from a Form, but this book does not provide enough detail. Overall, it is a good introduction to programming in C++ .Net."
2,Disappointed; mostly a rehash of C++ basics,"The first 12 chapters, over 200 pages, discuss the C++ language without a much about C++ .NET. I guess my expectations were too high. This is one rare time that I didn't look at the TOC prior to purchasing a book--lesson learned. Overall, the book is OK, just a little too basic for anybody with a few months VC++ experience. After two days I am almost finished with the book and don't feel much more enlightened about .NET than before I started studying."
5,Personal,"Sara Evans and her days as a mother, wife, and Diva...Pls Order this cd/dvd set for 13.88 at wal mart.com instead of paying 20 for it here"
2,major disappointment,"Bad quality control. Unit purchased came with two defective coax fittings, one on rotator and one on control unit. Both were oversize and cable fittings would not go on them. Filed them with a small file on end which seemed to be where problem area was until fittings would screw on using small wrench. Not good but unit did work when done. Note in instructions says overload of power supply will shut it down and initial power up showed that to be correct. Problem traced to ""balun"" coupler on ""DB4"" quad uhf bowtie antenna being used which really shorts out the power supply because of it's design. Solution is to use additional coax for signal as shown in instructions. Unit does seem adequate for light loads and works (now) as advertised."
2,Its definitely bent part 2.,"For the most part this isn't a very good tribute album. It mainly consists of either death or black metal bands maiming classic Priest songs. However, there are a few noteworthy efforts. Cage's cover of Freewheel Burning is by far the best one on the CD and is one of the best covers of any Priest Tribute CD for that matter. Sean Peck is an honor grad of Halford U. He has a style all his own though, which is obvious when you listen to other albums by Cage. Seven Witches does an excellent cover of Diamonds and Rust. They throw in a Victim of Changes riff in the beginning and a Breaking the Law riff at the end of of the song that actually works pretty well. Burning Inside does a good cover of Green Manalishi as well. Those three songs were worth what I paid for the CD but the rest of the covers did not round out the rest of the CD well at all."
3,Thyroid could be your problem,"This is a well-written book, but it seems to say that thyroid disorders are the potential root of all medical problems. Maybe so, but I'm not so sure."
2,Nothing New,"Regret to report information is rather stale. I for one was disappointed in general. Can't ""review"" further...I did read the book cover to cover and highlight in yellow. In fact, if someone wants this book, I'll mail it to them free of charge. KH"
5,"SOLVED, The Riddle of Illness",I have read and studied this book twice and will now use as a reference book. Anyone one with health problems could benefit from this information. With my doctor's help some issues have improved. A wealth of information in an easy to understand book. I highly recommend this book to everyone.
5,"Thyroid Problem, Read This Book","In basic simple laymans language, this book is an indepth look at thyroid problems and how they can be misdiagnosed. If you have depression or low blood sugar Dr. Langer looks at how you can bring balance to your life and body by examining your thyroid. This is an easy read."
2,Don't waste your money,"In my continuing search for information regarding hypothyroidism, I purchased this book. I must admit I was mostly put off by Dr. Langer's admitted prejudice against vegetarians. He seems to feel that vegetarianism only contributes to hypothyroidism and to be a healthy vegetarian you must be a nutritional expert. Not only do I believe this opinion is wrong, but I also feel it is irresponsible for Dr. Langer to make such claims.I also expected more indepth information concerning the diagnosis and treatment of hypothyrodism, but this book is not nearly as comprehensive as Mary Shomon's ""Living Well with Hypothyrodism"" or Dr. Shames' ""Thyroid Power"". Dr. Langer simply seemed to repeat the same thing every chapter: Barnes Basal Temperature Test and Armour Thyroid replacement. This book was a disappointment to read. I wouldn't recommend it."
4,Great thyroid information,Very good information on the thyroid and what diseases that can occur when your thyroid is malfuncting and how to test easily for checking function
5,It's like having your own personal teacher right there,"Having to keep up with CAD technology like I do, I do not have the time to take classes on the new AutCAD programs that come out. This book is constantly being pulled out and used to get me through Architectural Desktop R2. After I got through the beginning chapters that got me familiar with the program, I have been able to go to the chapters that deal with the specific commands that I need to use. The exercises that come with the book have been extremely helpful and make it so that I do not need to experiment on the drawings that I am working on. I have been able to, with the help of this book, make Architectural Desktop become a profitable purchase for the drafting company that I own. I would recommend this book to anyone that has Architectural Desktop R2 and for anyone thinking about purchasing the program. If you are in the latter category, you will be able to see the potential for the program. If you already have the program, get this book."
2,Where's the rest?,"The first season has 23 episodes. We as a family really do like the series, we would like to have the whole complete season. Not just a teaser of 5 shows."
4,Continuation of story?,"I loved Eon Kid Season 1 Vol. 1, but I thought Vol. 2 was a continuation of the first one. I should of just bought the first season vol. 1. Vol. 2. It's the same episodes that I saw on the first one and only five of them. I was upset, but the Amazon service was great."
4,"Eon Kid: Season 1, Vol. 1","My daughter liked the episodes very much. The DVD kept her entertained. My only complaint is the soundtrack was a little quiet on the first few episodes, but it got better on the latter 3 episodes."
1,2 Story Fire Escape Ladder,"I have two older fire excape ladders from the Dial company that I'm pleased with. The Dial ladder I purchased from the Stacks and Stacks company did not have the Dial name printed on it like my two others have and the red band is smaller and doesn't hold the ladder together well, it wants to flop out of the nylon red band (not good for an emergency situtation). And the PVC tubes that should lock in place to keep the ladder straight don't. When I asked to return the item it took several days to get the manager to call me back and I was told I would be charged the return shipping. I won't buy another one from this company."
5,Life Saver,"This product allows my children to flee our burning home without assistance, thus allowing the fire department to focus their attention on removing the wall safe from my office with fire axes."
5,Excellent family 2 pack!,"This was another great find! I recommend both these movies for anyone who has a child 10 and up who loves dogs, especially collies and half wolves. Good, clean, family fun! You could even watch them with your dog!"
4,"Great little inverter, good for laptop","I bought one of these at Walmart for around $15 when I couldn't find my no-name inverters. This one has worked great, I take it on every plane trip I go on. Normally I use this to power my laptop ($15 for an inverter is better than 50-100 for a laptop-specific DC power adapter, if you can even find one). One time when the battery was low, the inverter kept shutting itself off. It would work for a few seconds, then quit until I unplugged + plugged it back in. My theory is that when the laptop battery was extremely low, the power adapter was drawing more wattage than this little inverter could handle. Other than that one time, I've had no problems. Has a little fan noise, normally not noticeable. Definitely recommended, nicer (better built) than the no-name inverters I've tried."
2,No good on battery,"Our deep cycle battery and this unit do not get along. I wanted to use it at our cabin, but the shutoff is too sensitive. The light turns red as soon as you put a load on it. I have a much cheaper 40W unit that works better."
3,Black and Decker VEC1044BD 100 WATT INVERTER,home depot sold it cheeper and it also made alot of noise probly will burn out early worked good enough to run a dewalt batery charger
4,Excellent but noisy,Does exactly what it is meant for. I boughtthis to replace an el cheapo inverter I boughtat Sams...which literally burned up on me.I decided to go with a higher quality productafter that. (The laptop that I connected tothe snap/crackle/pop el cheapo inverternever was quite right after that incident.)The only downside of this product is that itsfan is noisy.
1,Not that good,"I was disappointed in this book. The section on breeding is very good but the book seems to be filled with ads for products. That is not why I buy a book. If I wanted products for my dog, I would go shopping at pets.com. Compared to the ""Official Book of Shih Tzu,"" ""Shih Tzu"" is not up to par."
2,Buen retention Module pero igual se partio,"Amd realmente SUCKSSSSSSSSSSSSSel athlon x2 6000 tiene unos pipes de cobre que no dejan encajar de una manera confiable el disipador al socket, se me partieron 2 de estos retention modules, por calor ademas la forma de ajustar lo deja a uno pensando que algun dia se va a partir.Intel con su core quad si sabe como ajustar un procesador a una mainboard, realmente intel le lleva muchos años de ingenieria a AMD."
5,An Incredible Audio and Visual Experience,"From the 1080p video to the TrueHD soundtrack, this HD DVD delivers. If you are a Nine Inch Nails fan or even a fan of special effects, you will enjoy this disc."
5,Perfection!!,"I'm not a huge NIN fan, but I do like a few of their songs and I did manage to see them live several years back. I've been looking for a hard rock/metal performance on Blu-ray for some time now and thankfully it has finally arrived. I'll make this quick and concise. This is by far and away the closest you will come to a live concert experience in your home without the band actually playing in your living room. The Dolby TrueHD audio married with 1080p VC-1 video bliss brings a truly breathtaking throw you against the wall concert experience. Forget any other regular concert DVD you've bought in the past. Nothing compares to what you are in store for here...nothing."
4,hmmm...,"I like this dvd, but I think it could have been a lot better. I was disappointed because I watched the hell out of ""and all that could have been"". If you are looking for the ultimate NIN concert then I would highly recommend that one instead. I played that dvd in the background all the time, it was an awesome concert and I believe it is much longer.By itself there is absolutely nothing wrong with this dvd, I was just expecting it to 1Up the last one. Beside you in time is great, the sound quality is great, and the video quality is great. This is worth owning, but in my opinion it is a step down from the last dvd they put out and I just don't revisit this one at all. 4 out of 5."
5,Incredible sound and video!!,"Wow this BD is AWESOME!!! By far the best sounding concert BD I've heard or seen ... 10/10The included Dolby sound ""optimizer"" is pretty cool too :) Try it when you get the BD."
2,Not as good as their earlier work,"I was disappointed in this work. To me, NIN earlier work, ""And All That Could Have Been"" live concert on DVD was MUCH better. That said, it's still pretty good. I would have given it three stars, but they also had to throw in some political innuendo, which is a huge turnoff for me."
5,Excellence!,As always;Nine Inch Nails (and of course Trent Reznor);made an excellent DVD with some great footage;and best of all was the sound quality.I am pleased!!!
5,Great quality,"The sound and video quality is top notch, there are very few shots that have any grainyness to them.The performance is one of the better live shows I have ever seen. A must have for any NIN fan that owns a HD TV."
5,Help me I am in Hell......,"I can't believe some of the reviews im reading.This DVD is amazing and there was NO awkwardness between the band.Jeordie White is an amazing bass player and he did not ""muck up"" Closer whatsoever. I think the summer tour version was better, but just because they really went off at the end which was great to see.Ok so AATCB was mind blowing. For $11.99 this DVD has already outplayed its worth to me for less than HALF the price!You people ask way too much. My only hope is that Trent goes on another tour soon in the states."
4,Standard fare from NIN - but that's a good thing.,"This is what you'd expect from a NIN documentary. The live footage captures the ""With Teeth"" tour perfectly - the stunning visuals and some nice tight shots of the band performing. Sound quality is excellent, and a feature that was new to me; the ability to set up the sound to match your system. I purchased the standard version, not blu-ray or HD - but I'm quite pleased with it.The bonus features are limited, but certainly enjoyable. I would have liked to see more on the 'in-studio' material - the few tracks included left me wanting more. And of course, it's nice to have the uncensored versions of the two videos from ""With Teeth"". The discography is lacking, for legal reasons, and with no teaser for the new album about a month away - it keeps me from giving this 5 stars."
4,Intensity in performance and lighting,"I truly enjoyed the performance, although if you're looking for warmth, the odd smile or to get to know the band better--you won't. Mr. Reznor talks almost not at all to the audience, never introduces the band members, or gives any information about the genesis of any of the material. The lighting, which is startlingly intense and well executed (I assume it's computerized), seems to often obscure the performances of the musicians. The vocals are dripping in angst, which begins to get a little annoying in a man of roughly 40, but the material is excellent, and the band sounds great. I find myself viewing it again and again."
5,A fun concert experience,"I haven't been able to attend a NIN concert in 10 or so years, but getting to watch this in HD was a real treat. Plus I didn't have to drive anywhere or deal with a crowd. This is a very well done concert and it looks and sounds great. I highly recommend!"
4,Great Value,Beside You in Time is a must watch for any NIN fan. Don't expect to find elaborated material (just the dvd and a one sheet leaflet with some art) inside the dvd case but the show itself makes it worth it.
5,Great show,"If you like NIN, this is a great dvd. Saw this show live. Hd dvd is the next best thing to the real show. Very cool."
3,There are better live compilations,"Generally I must admit my little disappointment of this DVD. The overall sound is unbalanced, often I can hardly hear one or more instruments. Also as far as I know there are no easter eggs on this release. Compared to And All That Could Have Been this release is a little bit weaker but it probably corresponds to the lower price."
5,Super charged NIN live dvd!,"Trent Reznor's and NIN are on top of their game on BSYIT, looks like Trents Reznor's cleaned up and got down to business. The film footage is high quality and the sound is great just what any NIN fan would want. Aaron North on guitar just rips and Josh Freese smokes on drums, the whole band is very tight. They end the show with very powerful version of Head like a Hole I got chicken skin watching it! A must for any NIN fan!"
5,"Great show, regardless of the format war.","For longtime fans of Nine Inch Nails, this show gives a great overall experience from the entire NIN spectrum. There are great songs from all the major albums, rarer songs for the die hard fans, and one of the best light shows from bands touring today. The HD experience of the lightshow can only be beat by being at the show! I attended the Denver show pretty close to this one and the setlists were very similar so Denver show fans should check this out. I am not going to debate on the format war since all I could afford for the time being was the xbox hddvd player but I can tell you that the HD experience from this dvd is incredible. The picture is perfect and fits the 32"" samsung I have perfectly. (no widescreen format bars!) The sound in dynamic and all encompassing. If you are a NIN fan, new or old and have the HDDVD player, I would pick this up, no question!"
5,Beautiful...,"If you've seen 'And All That Could Have Been' then you'll feel right at home with NIN's latest video tour. I love that this has been released in high defintion and the image quality obviously stands out over that of the previous DVD. Along with the beautiful video, the sound is likewise great. I have found little to no complaints to be honest and I enjoy this HD-DVD very much.That being said, this would be my only complaint. I think 'And All That Could Have Been' is a slightly better DVD. Perhaps it has something to do with the editing or it was the show itself, I'm not completely sure. I caught both halves of the With Teeth tour and based on what I saw, I would have to say it wasn't the actual show that I found less impressive.Don't let my opinion detour you from checking out this HD-DVD. It is withuot a doubt a beautiful video/concert and worth every penny."
1,Freezes Computers,"I tried the DWL-G122 USB adapter in two laptop computers - an IBM Thinkpad and a Sony Vio. In each computer, the adapter worked for about 5 minutes whenever I activated it and then caused the computer to freeze for about 20 seconds, then unfreeze for 5 seconds in a repeating cycle for as long as the adapter remained activated. I tried a Belkin wireless USB adapter in the same two computers and it worked flawlessly. I also noticed that during the 5 minutes the D-link unit worked in each computer, it its link speed was substantially lower than that of the Belkin unit."
4,"Great Product, but does not work with MAC","I've worked a lot with D-link products and I must say they're very good, but if your looking for USB WIFi Adapter that works on macs go for the DWL-122 not the G122, that small letter (G) tells you it wont work on MAC, I got distracted when making my order, so I didn't notice the model diference, and it's very easy to make that mistake. Other than that great product."
5,"Good product, works with USB 1.1","Just got the Adapter and spent one hour set it up. Set up was easy, but the utility software is not great. The desktop shortcut does not work, you have to click the link status symbol on the taskbar to bring up the utility window. Other than that, it worked very well and found the router no problem. It was connected to a USB 1.1 port on a 5 year old computer and it does not run hot/burning hot even after 2 hours of use.I am very happy with this adapter so far, but if it died within a year, I may change my mind."
1,Not Mac Compatible,"I bought this product with the assurance it would work with a Mac. It does not. I have downloaded several drivers and help pages to try to make this work, it does not. Don't buy for Macintosh use."
1,"Fragile piece of junk, period","The item worked okay for the two weeks that I used it-- pretty good signal strength and very easy configuration. Then it stopped suddenly... what a piece of crap! When it did work, it ran at a very high temperature. Don't electronic and computer manufacturers know how to design things around voltages and heat??"
2,"Great, until it died","Set up fairly easily, though it did involve two calls to customer service, and the folks there are not excellent, but eventually they can help. Worked fine, I was happy. Until it flat out quit functioning at all on Day 28 of it's young life."
2,worked great (for one week),"Inexpensive ($30) and easy to install on my Dell Vista desktop. Worked fine for one week, then kept having problems detecting the signal from my wireless access point. Coughed up $69 and bought a Linksys wireless-G USB adapter which works almost problem free (at 54 Mbps speed). Guess you get what you pay for...."
1,Misleading claims,"The summary for this product says: ""Provides wireless connectivity for any USB-enabled computer."" However, when I went to the DLink web site ( http://www.dlink.com/products/?pid=334 ) and downloaded the instruction manual, I found its system requirements listed as ""Windows XP/2000"" which does not include any of the USB-enabled computers I own.I am fortunate that I didn't go through the trouble of ordering it and waiting for it to arrive, only to have to return it. I wish Amazon would include the actual system requirements for all computer related products in a prominent place."
3,Great with XP but,"I have been using this adapter for almost 3 years now. Works flawlessly with windows XP. Vista, however is different story.Caution: Only version D1 of this product may work with Vista. D-link only provides beta version of drivers for D1 meaning it may or may not work. I have version A2 for which D-link did not bother to update the drivers and hence 3 stars. Not wanting to spend another $50, I will be sticking with XP."
5,Wireless USB Adapter that Actually Works!,"I've had an other brand USB adapter but it didn't get good signal at all. I could barely connect to hot spots and my home network even if I was within feet of the access point. Obviously I was dissapointed with that.But then I found this D-Link USB Adapter. The first thing I tested was it's wireless range. Fortunately it works great! I just plugged it in and I can wonder anywhere in my home. My other adapter, with same access point I have now, would only let me connect if I was in the same room as the AP, and even then it would disconnect randomly. This USB adapter is completely different and I am happy with my purchase."
2,OK but gave out,"Signal was okay + spotty at times, had to adjust the adpapter by pulling it out and plugging back in to USB port to reconnect the wireless signal. W/in 6 months, adpater has died. Purchased replacement adapter: Trendnet TEW423PI 54Mbps 802.11g Wireless PCI Adapter - and has worked great so far, stronger signal/connection although it has to be connected inside your PC."
1,Worked great 2 days!,"This adapter has a nice weighted base and upscale looking plastic parts. It worked great for 2 days so I threw away the box. Then it quit working. I packed it up and sent back to Amazon, hope to get a refund. I got a replacement Ativa which looks flimsey,light base,ect. BUT it works great so far. Amazon is pretty good about refunds."
2,Worked Great... But only for 2 Months.,"Worked great, used on Windows 2000, XP and even Linux.But stopped working after 2 months.Keep your box and CDs as they are required for an RMA. From the other reviews YOU WILL need to RMA it within the first year of use. Good thing it has a 3 year warranty."
4,Very positive critique for this product,"Bought 2 units, one for a laptop and the other for a desktop. Both are working very well and were very easy to instal - this was an upgrade from dial up connections to the internet. What an improvement!!"
4,Does what is is supposed to do,"Good deal allowed my son to disconnect the 100ft ethernet cable he had strung across the living room floor, down the stairs, down the hall, and into his bedroom in the basement, isn't wireless wonderful?"
1,Not stable,"If possible prefer an internal card than this USB external adapter since it is not stable, dropping a lot."
1,"Adapter did not work, Amazon did",The adapter was not compatible with my equipment and I returned it. Thanks to Amazon for prompt service and for fully crediting my return.
3,Choppy Signal. Drops Connection. Freezes Computer,"I set this thing up and it worked just fine. I'm very close to my LINKSYS wireless router and the damn thing just keeps on losing its signal. i dont knwo whether this is a OS problem or the hardware inside by e-Machine. The most aweful thing happens with the wireless card drops the signal and freezes my OS and I have to end up restarting my system. what the hell kind of crap is that for 50 bucks? When the device works, it works jsut fine, but beware of how to place of your computer so the connection is good enough and the signals dont drop. Make sure you follow the instructions for installation very carefully. I gave it a 3 stars because it's a lot better than pulling a freakin cable across my room, which works flawlessly, but what good is better technology when it's only good 25% of time ?"
1,More aggravation,I have set up several networks in my home wired and unwired as technology has advanced but Ill be damned if I could get this to work. A waste of $45 dollars and ALOT of time. (more than I care to mention!) Ok..over 2 days! go buy something else!
1,Simply doesn't work,"Bought this one few days ago. Just tried to install it.The supplied CD appeared to be not readable at all (tried on 2 different PCs ..).Got the driver from D-Link site, installed it following their instructions (quite lame ones, really ...).My Windows XP just cannot install it...Have to return it."
3,Okay for some things,"This adapter is okay if you need a quick fix, but compatibility issues and limited range can make it a headache to use."
1,Did not work,"Would not work with Dlink or Lynksys wireless routers. Called Dlink support and after 2 hours found out that the adapter was ""defective"". Was instructed to return to Amazon for replacement or refund."
3,Didn't last a year,"Setup was easy, and the product worked well while it lasted. Its lifespan, though, was shorter than I would have liked. After about 9 months, its performance began to deteriorate, and it was completely dead within a year."
1,"bad reception, strange software","got it today, tested it, very poor reception.strange software version.hardware has a rev A2 #2. not sure if this is why the software version is different but dlink support says version 3.0 software doesn't even exist as they are still at version 1.xreturning thismaybe just a bad unit. :-("
1,Doesn't work with Tivo,"Funny, I bought this same model product about two years ago and it works fine with both Tivos in my house. So I bought another one so I'd have two 802.11g adapters instead of one ""g"" and one ""b"" hoping that would speed up transfer times. But this new one didn't work on either Tivo. So I returned it and am out the shipping charges both ways.I'm loathe to spend the $50 Tivo wants for their adapter -- plus, it's got a long cord. So my search continues."
3,Setup hints,"Finally got this thing working after 3 hours of fighting it. Two tips:* try a different USB port. I wasn't getting the ""New Hardware Found"" like the manual said, until I tried a different port* try using the Windows configuration utility instead of the D-Link configuration utility. It just works. I couldn't get it to connect to my WPA-PSK router otherwise. So keep the ""Use Windows to configure my wireless network settings"" checkbox checked.Only 3 stars because it wasn't plug-and-play - it was plug-and-fight-for-3-hours-then-play."
3,"Fine for USB2.0, but don't even try with USB1.1","I tried to use this with an older computer that only had a USB1.1 port. The throughput was pathetic, limited to 56K and a call to Dlink tech support confirmed it.Works fine with another notebook with a USB2.0 port. Got up to 3Mbps on one bandwidth meter.m."
1,Not compatible with TiVo Series 2,I returned this item since it was not compatible with my TiVo series 2 DVR. It turns out that only some specific versions of the DWL-G122 will work with TiVo and the one I got on Amazon was the wrong version.
5,45 Feet away from Netgear router @ 75% signal strength!,"And thru one floor and two walls! It's a great device! The heavy base lets you set it out of the way and the installation is always a breeze no matter the PC operating system. Lol, I pick up my nieghbors network 150 feet away and across the street! So, not bad D-Link. :)"
4,No Problems,"I installed the drivers for this [then a quick restart was needed under WinXP], plugged the device in, and was up and running. No connection problems experienced so far - functions as expected.I have pretty much stuck to D-Link networking equipment for many years now. I was connecting this adapter to a D-Link wireless router. I have not tested it on any non-D-Link networks so I cannot comment on how well it interoperates. I would expect that it would be fine as 802.11g is a mature standard at this point but one can always be surprised.I have not tested this device under Linux or OS X so I cannot comment on its functionality in that respect."
1,Drops connection,"This USB adapter is wasting of money and time. Originally I wanted to upgrade my 11.b adapter to 11.g adapter, so i bought this one. It turned out a bad bad decision, the speed fluctuated so wildly, and drops connection several time an hour. And the distance betwen the adpter to the router is only 6 feet downstairs."
3,Not compatible with Windows 98SE,"I don't recall seeing this limitation in the technical data at Amazon.com. After much frustation trying to install on my 98SE system, called D-Link tech support and got an efficient analysis of the situration. An earlier version of this model was compatible, but not this one. Was able to return it for credit. Thanks for D-Link support and Amazon's return policy and prompt response."
4,This book was very helpful,"I have read this book twice, and refer to it as needed. It certainly outlined the characteristics of the breed and all have proven to be true. If there is a downside to this book it is all the information about showing, since my Min Pin is a pet. But then even that provided some good information.I liked the book and would buy it again."
2,amusing but useless,"My son enjoyed taking the tools out of the carrier and spreading them around the floor. That was the extent of the entertainment value of this toy, As far as being a ""tool"" toy, it's completely useless. The stuffed tools could really be any stuffed object as far as functionality goes. If you want to buy something ""tool-like"", then go for a sturdy plastic tool set. If your child is not old enough for one of those, they are probably not old enough to understand the concept of tools anyway and you should spend your money on a different toy. I think a sale price lured me into buying these stuffed tools."
4,San Diego's hidden punk scene,"Music that has mediocre lyrics, but quickly forgotten thanks to driven fast paced punk. Was part of San Diego's hidden punk scene that involved the likes of: Blink 182(pre-sellout), Sprung Monkey and more. If you like this pick up Murk Time Cruiser too. You should find these albums used cheap to top it off."
2,"Very Different, but entertaining...I guess","If you are expecting random violence and nudity, this is not the movie for you. It is kind of entertaining in parts, and funny sometimes, but I felt like I had to force myself to sit through it just because of the Troma label."
3,non-climatic,"an interesting movie, along the lines of ""american movie"". not really entertaining, kind of monotonous and non-climatic. i found myself finding other things to do while i watch this movie at the same time.the funny thing is that during the beginning of the movie i couldn't understand a work jeff would say, but towards the end i began to almost understand what he was saying.the part where he makes his own movie is, by far, the best."
4,Toe-tappin' for the kids,"I liked it, but more importantly, my kids liked it, especially my 4 year old. I read some of the other reviews posted here and I'm surprised that someone actaully took the time to blast the CD. It's fun, light-hearted and the kids really love it. And, in the end, that's the only thing that matters."
5,Truck Organizer,I am using this organizer in the trunk of a Nissan 370Z Roadster and it works great. It is just the right size to hold grocery bags and does not move around the trunk.
4,Good product.,"Good product, it does what it says it would do, but i wish it was a bit bigger. I saw similar products but the quality was not the same, this one on the other hand, quality is great, but i wish it was a little bigger for the same price. i have a 2005 honda civic. and it does stay put when u take the corners. i cant complain too much cause all of my stuff in my trunk did fit but just unable to add anything else."
4,Retail price is incorrect,"FYI: The retail price for this item (according to Rolaproducts.com), 59000 25 X 15"" is $63.73, not $89.99 as stated by Amazon. Rola sells a larger model, 59001 38 x 15"" that retails for $84.99. That might be one reason the disappointed shopper thought this product was going to be larger. It would be nice for Amazon to make the correction. The more accurate savings would be $16.05 or 27%."
4,interior organizer,"I was looking for a container to hold needed items in the trunk of my car. this interior organizer did the trick. I reccomend it. Now I'm looking for a collapsible container for holding jugs and cans when full, from tipping over."
5,Quality Product,"This is the first review I've written, just wanted to give this company credit for a very high quality and well designed product."
4,Used in my Audi A4,"It does slide around when I drive crazy, but if you're a standard issue law abiding citizen this thing holds stuff, is stable and is probably likely to stay in one place. It's tough material and I find it highly useful for organizing my emergency zombie attack supplies."
4,Great buy,"I've had this for almost a year now and no issues. Pros: folds up nice so you can use your trunk when you need it, the sections are adjustable (awesome for groceries). Does not slide around in a carpeted trunk. Cons the sections are a bit flimsy, great for groceries I would not put anything heavy in there though like a package of bottled water, or free weights, pretty much anything heavier than a two gallon jug of milk is a bit to heavy and can warp the sections. I'm currently planning on reinforcing mine with rigid fiberglass. Overall great product, if it were a bit more durable I'd give it 5 stars, however I got it for groceries, not for lugging heavy items."
4,Works like a champ,This is a very nice organizer. Heavy duty. I work with horses so I keep my muddy boots and gloves in the organizer and it keeps my trunk from getting all messy. There is no mesh or openings for the dirt to come out. It is a good size and the adjustable dividers allow me fit the two boots together and then the smaller stuff in other slots. The design of the bottom keeps the organizer from sliding around in my trunk. The product had no smell and I've been using it for about a month now.
5,Solid Structure,Nice size (about two grocery bags) it doesn't take up the whole trunk space. Adjustable dividers are a nice feature. Best part is the solid structure.
4,ROLA M O V E Rigid base interior organizer,"Very well constructed, substantial materials used. I actually purchased it as an interior organizer to sit between the front and rear seats of my auto, but it is too large, so I will use it for storage in the trunk of the auto. If the manufacturer was inventive, they would produce a smaller model that would be about 12 inches wide and would straddle the drive tunnel in an auto between the front and rear seats. It would provide great extra storage space for travel. Being small it could be easily removed when passengers are in the rear of the vehicle."
5,Just what I was looking for!,Perfect fit. Nothing rolls around in the back of my SUV anymore. ya da ya da ya da ya da
3,"Great, hard to find songs from the 70's","This cd could have been awesome, it contains almost all of The Royal Jesters songs that were recorded in the 70's except for She's Coming Home. Whoever did the hatchet job on the engineering really screwed up what should have been a great cd. Someone tried to convert the mono versions into stereo and added tons of reverb for some strange reason. The result is very bad audio. Most of these songs were released nationally on the Bell or Bang record labels which were distributed by Columbia Records. Most of these 45's are very hard to find nowadays and are very sought after by die-hard Royal Jester fans. Sadly, I say save your money on this cd, not because of the music but because of the horrible audio."
1,reviewing royal Jesters.wishing It was Yesterday,"I, didn't like the cd at all,nome of the songs,were very good,vocals and music is outstanding,But if I, had known;the songs on cd I would've never bought it."
2,Basic info..,Basic info with a few good tips. Video quality (especially lighting) was not very good. DVD received ran approx. 40 minutes rather than the 50 advertised.
1,I was expecting something of value,"I was extremely disappointed being a 1 month old mariner. I expected to visually learn much from this dvd, but it was so basic I cannot believe anyone would consider this value for money. Most of the video was hold to dock with wind coming from different directions.. my advice is buy a book and read all about this in about 10 mins and save money and 50 mins of your life."
1,cd not what I ordered,"The cd was in a cover which was titled correctly, and the cd, itself, was labelled correctly. However, the cd content did not have any of the songs on the ""Solace"" album. It had two songs & videos of live performances, instead. I emailed the seller, but got no reply."
5,A gem of a musician,"Definitely a striking blend of music. His ability to produce this much coherent sound by himself (he is accompanied on only four tracks) is amazing. ""GBA"" is my personal favorite (excellent rhythm) which sums up his blend of didgeridoo and guitar. ""Let Me Be"" is a fun, diverse track. Not a bad song on the whole album. (Also his take on ""No Woman, No Cry"" is tasteful)"
1,Not a good review book!,"While studying for my Step 2, I tried to use every resource I had to ace this exam. Step-Up is not a book I'd recommend.While I did finish this book from cover to cover (when I start something I must finish it), it only covered absolute BASIC medical knowledge. I don't think I gained anything from studying this book except for reinforcing my knowledge from Step 1 studying.This book skips a lot of important information covered in Crush for Step 2 which is why I do not recommend this book to anyone preparing for their Step 2. Spend your money on USMLE World Qbank and Kaplan Qbank, both are more precise and detailed as to what is asked for this exam.Good luck to all you future doc's!"
4,excellent,this seller is excellent with respectable behavior as the book is very clean and arrived in a reasonable time .thanks a lot and i recommend everyone to buy from him
2,Don't buy it....,"Hi, I bought this camera and installed the driver from both the CD and then the web. It caused my computer (a good, modern, fast computer) to crash both times. The camera worked without interfacing with the computer, but, then, what's the point? Also, the pictures and movies were VERY grainy and low quality. The tech support when I had these problems was HORRIBLE. They really didn't stand behind the product AT ALL and to me that's the most important thing! Maybe I could have gotten it to work, but not without SOME input from Aiptek.I've never written one of these reviews before, but this really got to me. Don't buy this camera is my advice."
3,You get what you paid for!,"it's a very good price, cheap we could say. And the features are kind of interesting. Cool desing and light weight too...But you can't predict how long it will last. It's avery ""fragile"" camera and still the software doesn't work even after downloading it from the site. I recommand to spend more and get a better camera!"
3,im actually 17 but anywaz....,ok ok in the beginning when i got this camera i loved it but then I found myself wishing it had a freakin light on it or somethin and i got it on sale for only 50 so i mean i couldnt have expected so much ya kno? so now im lookin for a new video camera(one that specifically says good in lowlight situations)....maybe this time ill get one over 100 dollars ha.i took some great outside pictures and videos with it tho if that makes you feel any better
4,good buy,"it's a good buy for the price. i have only one complaint. the usb cable didn't fit in this camera, but luckily i had my own, it fits my Motorola phone charger usb cable."
3,IF I HAD IT TO DO AGAIN I WOULD'VE BOUGHT A BETTER CAMERA,"FOR 15 DOLLARS ITS NOT BAD,THE QUALITY OF AUDIO IS GREAT,THE QUALITY OF STILL PHOTOS,NOT SO GOOD,THE QUALITY OF VIDEO NOT SO GOOD EITHER,EASY TO USE,I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS IF YOU WERE GOING TO BUY THIS FOR A KID 10 OR YOUNGER BUT I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS FOR ANYTHING ELSE,I AM VERY INTERESTED IN THE PARANORMAL AND USE MY CAMERAS TO CHECK BASICALLY WHAT YOU WOULD CALL ""URBAN LEGENDS"" AND THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO LIGHT OR LED'S INSIDE THE LENS OR ON THE CAMERA ITSELF IS KIND OF A BUMMER TO ME, I'M GOING TO GET A NIGHT VISION CAMCORDER AND SLR OR ""SINGLE LENS REFLECTION DIGITAL CAMERA, I KNOW THIS IS OFF TOPIC BUT IF ANYONE KNOWS OF ANY SUPPOSED CREATURES OR HAUNTINGS IN INDIANA AND KNOWS THE APPROXIMATE LOCATION OR A WEBSITE WITH INFORMATION ON THE LOCATION AND STORY PLEASE CALL ME AT (317)226-9930,(317)384-8056 OR EMAIL ME AT prestonb51@yahoo.com"
2,"dont buy, cheap plastic support internally (base)","Initially, I was please with this product...blue porcelain matches the decor in my bedroom. Rarely use.. on table mostly for looks...used it a couple times and then it broke. When hanging up the phone, be careful because the handle holder is only secured with plastic inside the porcelain base. I took it apart and repaired it with super glue and to my amazement was disappointed with the flimsy cheap structural support of the handle holder Now everytime I answer the phone, I'm always careful so as not to shatter the plastic casing in the porcelain"
1,Change the channel,"This book is like being held hostage while someone else randomly changes channels. Lechner offers no insights to America's obssession with television. Instead, he merely recaps whatever show he happens to be watching. I would sooner flip through old issues of TV Guide than re-read this book."
4,Seminal TVP's Album,"It's hard to rate TVP's LP's, they are very much a love it or leave it deal. I was a Mod... is however a great example of a band -not- giving up and losing it in their later years. The weak opening number (As John Belushi Said) is followed up by the totally rocking title track - the third cut (A Stranger to Myself) is a wonderful counterpoint), sad, insightful, sweet.""Little Woody Allen"" marks the second mention (to my knowledge) of WA in a TVP's song (see also Salvador Dali's Garden Party on the wonderful ""Privilege"" album) --- it's a very sweet but slightly pandering homage to Woody that was written pre his separation from Mia.Tracks 8, 9 and 10 make a wonderful little song circle - again, sad but beautiful."
5,Really does the job,"Strawlike hair afterwards can be avoided by then using your favorite conditioner. This product really lifts and help to manage my fine, color-treated blonde hair. Recommend it highly."
3,Mini doesn't refer to the content,"the book itself is a mini book, I was unaware that dummy books came this small, it is almost a joke/gag gift size. I will place it in a survival kit, the information is good, but I would have rather had a quick primer on basic fishing skills rather than a small print of fishing skills."
2,Not much book for the money,"I was disappointed in this book. For the high price, I expected it would be much more comprehensive. Includes a few photographs, many rather crude line drawings and very little text. There is very little here that isn't found in countless other books on Oriental rugs and most of those can be had for far less money."
5,Love,"So cute, gave to my sister in law and brother. They had just gotten a german shepherd. FUN for her since she loves to bake"
5,"A great ""keeper"".","I love this book and have for nearly 50 years. I try to give a copy to my friends on the first ""special"" day (birthday, etc.) after we meet. It is so adorable and everyone I've treated with this book say they love it. They also share it with others. It is so unusual these days to get a giggle on every page and laugh out loud in spite of yourself.Copies have been difficult to find and my latest were not printed on good paper but I'll take them anyway I can get them. Thanks"
3,Jigs and Juleps,I was a bit disappointed with this book. Some chapters were very good - others not so good. I won't be buying any more books in this series. Thanks. Gwen
5,Unforgettable,This gem was serialzed in an Atlanta newspaper about 1960. I immediately bought several copies and managed to keep one. I highly recommend this intreging story about the innocence of childhood. It is loaded with humor & appreciated by grown-up children especially those who enjoyed living in a parsonage.
2,NO cool setting,This heat gun was a disappointment because it has no cool setting.9 times out of 10 after you heat something up you want to cool it down. This unit only has high heat and low heat. NO cool setting.
3,Kidnapped,"This is a fairly represented story about a boy taken without permission, although after reading it, I am unsure of the accuracy of this story."
1,Author can't get even simple facts right,"I knew the facts were going to be questionable when I opened the book to the chapter called ""Brooklyn"" (pg 30) and read ""in the Boro Park section of Williamsburgh Brooklyn...."". A simple map of Bklyn would have showed this lady from NJ that these are two separate communities. If she can't get this right, how can she be relied on to get anything else straight? This is a totally one sided, self hating story - which would be the case whether it were fiction or non fiction. One star for all those interesting errors and pseudo dialogue."
5,just what i needed,"good fit for a five and three yr old, washable, cant say anything negative. they were just what we were looking for!"
5,Excellent.,"This is an excellent film, one that provides new insights into a very creative and talented man."
4,very intense,"if you like uncle slam you will really like this cd it not as good as ""will work for food"" but it has it's good point's and it's still uncle slam as most uncle slam fan's know ""will work for food is hard to find so trust me you will like this one very much."
2,beginner,"It could have been blind faith, however I was disappointed that I couldn't get past the software. Did every thing as instructedand my PC was minimum plus. Still could not get things working.Tech support not too helpfull.Ended up returning both the 1800u and the 1800AFL. A disappointing experience.TRIED"
1,Pathetic,"Color cast is always off; editing software is clunky; levels adjustment is incredibly clumsy; scanner is prone to crashing (all the time); scanner won't calibrate properly for film strips. I have wasted an unbelievable amount of time trying to scan with this machine, and then fixing the scanned products, and am incredibly frustrated. I'm using the more advanced version than this - the PF 3600 Pro, but it sounds like it has the same problems. My advice is to troll the Internet and mags for solid reviews, and spend your scanner money accordingly ... or wait 2 more years for the manufacturers to get us off their bleeding edge."
3,"Cost effective, works good, driver glitches","Reading some of the below reviews, I am reminded with I use a Mac: things usually work. The PF1800 is actually a good, not outstanding, scanner. I am scanning all my Dad's slides in and it produces good, easy to use results. I use about 1200 to 3000 dpi and it works well with manageable file sizes. Previously I was using an Epson flatbed scanner w/ slide attachment which as much slower and could not reliably reproduce quality scans. The PF1800 does though although not perfectly: it has trouble with darker slides which come out very grainy despite various manipulations. Also its CyberView 35 driver in Mac OS X (Panther) is not glitch free: it often mysteriously retrieves an old scan while posting a NEW slide and freezes up occasionally. But it's MUCH cheaper than the rest and it DOES WORK. I've done about a thousand slides with it so far... I should know. Also check out Costco.com for a better price. Happy scanning!"
5,Buy Them All - Lots of Fun,"My nephews (5 years, 17 months) loved Playin' Collection so now I have just given them Singin' Collection and Wigglin' Collection. Many songs on each CD to keep them entertained and to help themlearn more about music besides singing and acting out the songs. My nephews also like the songs that they can 'freeze like a statue' when the music stops. Lots of fun! Definitely a great gift for children.Now we have Playin' Collection, Singin' Collection and Wigglin' Collection. Check them out!"
5,Wigglin' away in seconds,"My son is 6 months old and within seconds of turning the CD on, my son was Wigglin' away in his bouncy seat. He couldn't stop smiling and laughing. Thank you Ms. Wiggles for hours of enjoyment."
5,Great product!,"Really happy with the product!Not as bulky as I expected (that's a GOOD thing), easy to use in almost any place on the dash or on the console.Has not slipped at all so far.So much easier and better than the suction cups!!"
4,Garmin Alternative,"There is IMHO a simpler and cheaper solution. Check out the Arkon Friction Dash Mount. It has four thinks going for it as compare with the Garmon Dashboard mount:1, It is cheaper.2. It is smaller and, I think, looks better.3. It comes with a little loop at the back that can be secured to a stick em hook for additional security.4.It comes with a separate ADJUSTABLE suction cup mount that provides additional flexibility for height adjustments.If you want to use the Garmin windshield suction cup, you can save even more money by buying the Arkon Mat only."
5,great substitute for the traditional window suction method,"This works great, especially after my GPS twice popped out of the suction mount and flung at me while driving. The only issue I have is it is pretty big and covers the vent on my KIA hybrid which is located in the left corner."
1,updated review,UPDATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!locking feature broke after 1 week...now the gps swivels at every rock on the road.whole thing eventually cracked at the base.Garmin actually used super glue or something to keep the base together.cheaply made junk.hopefully yours doesnt fall apart as mine lasted me a month.
5,Good product,"Works very well but one warning. Do not Armour All your dash in the spot you choose to place it, it will slide off."
5,Best mount ever!,"I have spent a lot of money, and endured a lot of frustration, trying to find a mount that works well in different vehicles without the hassles of suction cups and fit all clips. Have had other friction mounts that would not stay in place. This mount stays where you put it. Wish that I had found this one a long time ago. Thank you Garmin, and Amazon."
4,ladyel,This portable Garmin mount holds your GPS in one place letting you focus on your driving instead of having your head lowered to see your GPS as you drive. A must have accessory.
4,Good Product,"Picked this thing up after reading other reviews. Most were dead on. Sits well on the dash of my 2000 Pontiac Grand Am. I find that I like to use it when it's night by putting it on the left side of the dashboard. During the day, I find myself using the mount that came with my 680. The difference is that at night, if using the original mount.. there is a hell of a reflection from the Nuvi screen onto the windshield. When my 680 is on this mount, in the left corner.. no reflection!Product also showed up within a few days of ordering. I would purchase this if you have a few vehicles."
5,Well designed product.,"I bought this after already having the adhesive version. The adhesive version works well, but leaves oily type marks on my dashboard. This ""bean bag"" style leaves no marks on the dashboard and adheres well. Despite driving quickly on curvy roads, this mount held my Garmin GPS securely and it did not slide at all. I recommend this product."
5,Very useful,This holder is nice: You will never have to worry about GPS falling off. You can move it around whenever you want so that the GPS won't obstruct a particular angle.I hope there is a similar product for smart phone.
5,Best BEST best BEST on the market for this purpose,"I believe I have earned the title I gave this review, cuz I think I've tried them all!!! Bottom line - having to rely on the NUVI suction cup is always going to be a disaster, regardless of the dash-mount bases I have tried. Soooo frustrating. BUT finally, this friction mount is PERFECT! I've had it for several weeks, and it is so comforting to get in the car and know that the NUVI will be right where I left it (instead of on the floor), and to know that it will stay there when I'm trying to navigate. For added protection, I did place a large sticky pad dash mount underneath this mount, but I do not even believe that was necessary cuz it never budged without it (even on my sloping dash)!! Finally, a solution to such a silly problem!!! Get this mount if you want your NUVI to stay where you put it ALL the time!!!"
5,Really good mount,"This is a good mount, does not slide around even if you have it near the edge of dash. We are very please with this item."
5,it stays put,This works great and it stays where I put it! Arrived quick and just set it in your car and you are set to go.
4,good product,I recently purchased this item and it is working much better than I anticipated. It works good in my vehicle as the window has such a deep slant that I found it difficult to use the window mount.
5,Garmin Portable friction Mount,Garmin Portable Friction MountThis is a great product and it met all expectations. It sets and stays in place where placed.
4,Tired of your Garmin falling off the windshield?,Our Garmin would fall off the windshield in cold weather. We have that in the Midwest! This mount works much better than the suction mount.
5,it stays put,i really dont know how it works but it does not move. its great. you can turn quickly and stays put. i use it every day. i love it
5,Garmin Friction Dashboard Mount,I bought this mount with a Garmin 360 and it works perfectly. I've seen these mounts in stores at $10 to $20 more. Once you've used this type of mount you'll never go back to a windshield mount.
3,Seems to have lost it!,"Bought this must have Garmin accessory, April 2009 and it did what it was supposed to do. Over the last 18 months it has lost its ""staying power"". I always have the power charger cable plugged in when I'm using the GPS because when you turn a corner or have to brake more excessively than usual, it takes off and lands in the extremities of the dash area. In a Chevy Avalanche it goes a long way, so to make things easy and not put my life on a death wish list I use the cable to haul it all back to where its supposed to be!"
5,Convenient,It is much more convenient than suction mount. A little bulky. Stable in Mazda6 2010. Fall down only once when I put it on the edge and started too fast.
4,works great,product is a very good item that works great in my suv. It's alittle over priced but I still think worth the money
5,Garmin Dashboard Mount for GPS,"The Garmin we ordered came with a windshield mount but we found it to be unsatisfactory and ordered this dashboard mount. It works like a charm and we are very pleased with it. The arm that holds the GPS rotates and then can be locked in place. Programming the GPS is easier with this holder because you can pick it up and hold it as you enter the information. Also, whenever we leave the car we just remove it from the dashboard and put it on the floor where it is not visible, a good security precaution. We highly recommend this portable mount if it fits the model Garmin you have."
5,Garmin Portable Dashboard Mount,"I LOVE this dashboard mount! Expensive but worth it. Really works well - GPS fits on easily, I can remove it and put the mount on the floor each time I get out of the car EASILY and the tilt of the GPS it adjustable so you can always see the screen."
5,The one to have!,"My Father bought this portable friction mount when he got his first Garmin a few years back. When I bought a Garmin of my own, I was gifted a similar device which was so vastly inferior to this product that I ended up ""borrowing"" his whenever I went more than a few hours away. He finally got fed up with sharing his and got me one of my own this year... thanks Pops! I love it, it does everything I need it to and I don't have to worry about it breaking when it's manhandled by the kids, it's very durable. I'm purchasing this one for my friend as he's unhappy with the window mount that came with his Garmin and absolutely loves mine! Great product!"
2,Still slips,"Still had to put non skid bottom under it. 66 year old man with Mercedes, No hole shots & no polish on dash. They need to go back to drawing board."
4,Works very well,"I bought this item because the suction cup from my previous GPS unit kept falling off the windshield at the worst times, like right before a turn or in the city. Basically a bean bag with a hard plastic bottom it sits on the dash fine. I am happy with it.The only issue or problem is when the dash is clean, it slides around a bit. Which can get interesting if the window it's sliding toward happens to be open and we're going along at 60."
5,Great Product!!!,If you have a Nuvi ... you MUST have one of these !!! The best for in the car ... far better than the window mount unit.
5,Garmin friction mount,No more suction cup failures! This is the best mount that anyone could get for their Garmin! I highly recommend it!
5,Perfect!,"This is exactly what I wanted--easy to mount anywhere and no more need to ""try"" to stick my Garmin to the windshield."
4,Great product,"I recently purchased this garmin portable friction mount from amazon. Really a great product. As I live in california, I cannot mount my gps on the windshield. I was looking for a mount that is portable, something that you can mount on or near dashboard, easy to mount and remove my gps. Looking at the number of thefts and car breakins, I wanted something that can be safely tucked away from prying eyes. The portable friction mount did exactly that. I haven't really taken it for long trips or experimented its stability on different road conditions. But so far, so good. Wonder why garmin wouldn't include it as part of the gps package. The windshield mount doesn't come anywhere close.The only downside to it is the size. The footprint is a little big. It doesn't sit as snugly and comfortably on my honda civic as it does on my camry.Overall a great buy."
5,What a GODSEND,My Windstar van was impossible when it came to using the provided mounts. The Beanbag Mount is a GODSEND. Now if i can find a friction mount for my Sirius for my '66 Mustang.
4,Friction Mount (010-10908-00) for Nuvi,"Product works as advertized without problem. Stayed on my slightly curved dashboard without slipage, even at moderate speed of making turns. Highly recommend the product."
5,Works well,"I have a Garmin nuvi 360, and it was very annoying that the windshield attachment that came with it basically didn't work for me.This mount has worked well, I haven't had it fall once even under acceleration/breaking scenarios."
5,Nice Device,"This beanbag GPS mount is a lot more convenient than the suction mount for my purposes. The suction mout is okay, but not as many options as the beanbag. I'm sold on this product."
4,Garmin Mount,"The only drawback with this item is its' bulkiness which makes for a tight fit on the console, however with the theft concern when using a window mount, I willing to accept this drawback."
5,Should be included.,"The windshield mount is a joke. This product is excellent, portable, very easier to adjust screen angles, and stays in place even during fairly heavy breaking on the freeway. Product should be included for free in states where windshield mounts are illegal (i.e. California)... Universal fit, I've used for both my Nuvi 350 and a friends Nuvi 660."
4,I like this product,"I use this mount with the Garmin Nuvi 350. It is portable with the unit (removing the swivel mount makes it flatter when packing). It can be placed under the seat to get it out of site when you are not in the car. I would have given it five stars if the swivel allowed the GPS to be tilted up a little further, as I like the unit on the console where glare is generally not a problem."
3,Generally works but still slides off the dash now and then.,"When I corner or accelerate hard the GPS with this mount sometimes slides off the dash. Not always, but once in a while. It could be more ""grippy"". I have had mine about 3 years. No other issues."
5,Garmin Portable Friction Mount,A must item for your Garmin. The only way to go. The windshield mounts are illegal in California. This should included with every Garmin
4,does the job,"Not very elegant, but works like a charm. It even took the stem from my old holder which was wired into the car electrical."
5,Great accessory,Its so much better to use the bean bag than the suction cup. So much easier to attach or remove the GPS from its cradle. And you don't have to extend your arm so much as you can place the bean bag closer to the dash.
5,GPS FRICTION MOUNT,Received my portable friction mat quickly and have used it on a daily basis. It was definitely a great purchase and I would recommend this product to others without hesitation.
4,Portable Garmin stand,"The stand works well. Occasionally it falls off the dashboard, but not where I wouldn't recommend it."
3,gps accessory,"Did not really have a place to put this massive structure on the dashboard since it was uneven and round. This was made for a flat dashboard or at least not round like in my vehicle. When tested in a vehicle with a flat dashboard it worked well, for awhile, until the dust picked up and this device lost its' grip. Keep your dashboard and the bottom of the GPS holder clean to maintain grip. Once again, not impressed."
4,Stays Put,I use this with my Nuvi and it simplifies switching between cars. It's a little large but it does stay put on the dashboard.
3,Friction Mount for Garmin Nuvi 760,"I am sure this is a great product - we needed a dashboard friction mount for our Streetpilot Garmin - but it is not needed for this Nuvi. The suction cup mount has been improved and works great! So this one will be returned - again, not because it is a bad product but because we really do not need it."
5,Garmin portable friction dashboard mount for nuvi series,"This product is definitely worth buying, and I have recommended it to all of my friends who have a Garmin. It makes the Garmin totally portable. It is easy to use."
4,hide it,"The Garmin Portable friction dashboard mount is a must for the purchaser or the Garmin GPS. It sits nicely on the center of the dashboard. I have only had one instance in the 6 months I've owned it of it falling from the dash after a very abrupt stop. Otherwise when you leave the auto you can set in on the floor, seat or in your compartment. No one checking autos for a GPS to make off with will know you have one in the car. This purchase is my second one (a Christmas gift)."
5,Great Product,This is very well made.The unit stays where you place it on your dash board.Also it holds the nuvi so there is no more falling out of its holder while driving.
5,Great Option for SUVs,"Great product for SUVs (or any vehicle with a sloping windshield). I bought this as an add-on for my Garmin Nuvi 780 and it's been great. The very first time I used it was on an 2,400 mile trip in my Jeep Grand Cherokee. The dash mount puts my Garmin within arms reach because it sits on the ""tray"" on top of the Jeep's dashboard and has a great range of movement to put your GPS in almost any position. This makes it much more accessible than those suction cup mounts that make me stretch out of a safe driving position to read or access the GPS. And, it gives my passengers the ability to easily access the unit to help navigate or find gas stations, etc. The dash mount is heavy enough to stay put even on rough roads. Highly recommended."
3,steady mount,"It is a nice study friction mount. Does not move at all when braking or turning. The price is high to me, so minus a star."
5,Always wanted one,"I've always wanted one of these friction mounts for my Garmin, but they wouldn't work with my old one. I got a new Nuvi for Christmas. So, I ordered a friction mount from Amazon. I love it!"
5,Works well,works as advertised in both cars. Easy to setup and remove quickly. Much preferred to the windshield mount.
4,Better tool!,I had been using the suction cup on the windshield and got so tired of it falling off. It actually ended up cracking the screen although it still works. This is a big improvement over that application and recommend it to anyone.
5,Garmin Friction Mount,Solved all my problems ! I travel multi-state and some do not allow windshield mounted GPS units. Also the unit is easy to take down and set under the seat to prevent theft ?
5,A much better mount than the suction cup,"A dear friend of mine gave me this mount for my Nuvi (after I had recommended the Nuvi to him). My husband immediately ""borrowed"" it (he is the kind that has to use his GPS to get to work everyday even though he always drives the same route!!). So, I had to buy another one (for my husband so that I can have mine back).This mount is much better than the suction cup that came with the Nuvi (it never could hold a suction in my car). It also ""travels"" better since you don't have to have the stick-on disk required by the suction cup. Note of caution: whatever is used to weight down the mount appears as tiny nails in the x-ray screening machines in airports."
5,Mount for Garmin,"Easy to put on dash and mount Garmin, take down and put in glove box. Don't like the window suctions which lets people know you have a Garmin or GPS in the vehicle, and smash your windows. Out of site, secure!!"
4,works great,Its perfect for ppl who do not want to attach their gps on the windshield. The mount is stable and gives great flexibility. Definitely a great buy for gps owners.
5,Perfect for any car,We have used this Nuvii base for over a year in three different personal vehicles and two rentals. The versatility and stability of this base just cannot be beat! I highly recommend this item.
5,GPS Dash Mount,"I bought this as I had no place to mount my GPS unit permanantly. It is great, it doesn't slide around. It contours well to most dash boards. The only problem is that it's bulky to store when not in use.I would buy it again and recomend it to others."
3,works ok,Got this because Minnesota doesn't allow winshield mounting. It works better on my big RV dash than my Mustang. As long as your dash is pretty big it will work.
5,Garmin friction dash mount,Couldn't be more useful. No reaching required and there is no inclination to slide on my Mini's dash - even driving AGGRESSIVELY!
5,I like the portability of this mount.,"I like this mount better than the suction cup mount to the windshield. It's easy to switch to the different cars I drive, and the weight keeps it anchored when driving. Very pleased."
5,Great product!,I have a VW Jetta and this is perfect for the dashboard. It is very secure and my Garmin GPS and Mount fit neatly in the glove box.
4,Solid mount base but it's really big,I guess I did not know how much space this would take up on my dash. I should have checked the dimensions and checked the measurement in the car. I will use this base in another car because I'm sure it will not move once placed on the dash. I don't think it really needs to be as big as it is though.
4,Garmin dash mount,This unit is much better to use than the windshield suction cup. It works well and is easily moved to hide the GPS. Works well with the Nuvi 255W.
4,gps mount,"This item works really well in both our vehicles. No slipping at all. Just put it on top of the dash and drive away. It is made for easy removal and to program closer to your eyes, and at arms length. Just buy it!"
5,GPS portable mount is just right.,"I didn't buy this when I bought our Garmin GPS.Instead, I fiddled around with the mount that came with the unit.That was awkward and in the way when mounted on the windshield.Then I bought another product that was equally awkward.I'm so glad I finally bought this portable mount. It sets on our Camry dash, stays put, doesn't get in the way, is easy to adjust, and easy to stow under the seat when we leave the car.If you are trying to decide on a portable mount, buy this one.This is ""just right""."
5,Terrific buy :-),"The Garmin Portable Friction Mount is perfect in any car for the Garmin GPS. Easy to travel with and use when driving a rental car,especially."
3,Its Big. Make sure it will fit on your dash.,"This item works great but it is very large. Make sure it will fit on your dash before you order. If it fits it works great. If not, not so much. Amazon should put the size on the web page. Its about 8"" across."
5,Garmin Dashboard Friction Mount,This product performs better than I expected. It holds its place just about any place it's placed in the dash area. So it actually gives me more placement options than I expected.
5,Garmin Portable Friction Mount,This is the best car mounting device. So easy to move around and hide when not in use. I love it.
3,GPS holder,Receieved this product very fast and new; no problems. I like the fact that it's portable and I can just pick it up and move it where I want including my lap if I'm idling trying to find my destination on my GPS.
1,do not buy this. it's garbage. it's not worth 5 cents.,do not buy this. it's garbage. it's not worth 5 cents. it is crap. i don't want to be rude or i'd use a lot of profanity to describe it.
1,Misleading Product Photo,Should change the product picture to match with the product's description. I have to use the case to store my portable harddisk instead
1,have no clue as to how to use this,"This item did not come with any instructions as to how to use with the Garmin GPS. I have the model that is supposedly compatible with it but I have never figured out how it works with the mount. I have looked online for directions as well, but with no luck. I am very disappointed for throwing away the $30."
1,Friction Mount Arm was missing!,"When I got the frustration free package, I discovered it was missing the Portable Friction Mount. it's all but frustration free. You are better off with the original packaged items."
1,GARbage,the TINY screws that attach the mount to the pad quickly become loose and fall out (some fell into the defroster vent) the remaining TINY screws are IMPOSSIBLE to put back in. I had to drill out the holes in the padding to make them larger and then had to use (LARGER) self-tapping screws and force them into the mount. I was VERY LUCKY it worked. More Junk from China.
2,Disappointed!!!,I am off road quite a bit. This product is not stable at all on the dash of a 4 Runner. It jumps all over the place and is totally unacceptable. Even in town there is much too much movement. I would return it if there was value received versus the shipping cost.
3,Probably not needed,"This friction mount works O.K., but the windshield mount is much more stable and useful. The only reason to buy the friction mount would be if your state does not allow windshield mounts or your windshield was so far away due to a large dash that you would have trouble reaching the GPS.It does what it is supposed to do, just not practical for the cars I have."
1,just marvelous for the price,"I feel I made a good decision to buy this stuff. For the price it is just marvelous. I had brought two earlier from brand stores and it went bad so quickly. It is so sturdy, elegant and handy. Thank you Amazon"
1,do not buy from beach camera,"Do not waste your money buying this from BeachCamera. They will not send you the product as shown (they will send you the beanbag, but not the part that you actually attach to the GPS.)I don't know if this is the case every time, but in mine they conveniently did not include an invoice either, so when I attempted to resolve this with them I was told there was ""nothing I could do."" They don't have invoices on file for the products they've sold? Seems shady...Looks like a good product, but I cannot tell until I purchase the rest of it from a different company."
1,Dangerous,"I bought this after being ticketed for having my GPS mounted on my windshield. IMO, this mount is dangerously distracting, compared to a windshield mount. I'm going to keep using it, though, because it's the law in Illinois.The mount slides all over the place in my Acura 3.2TL. When the light changes and I'm in line to make a left turn, I can be going slow enough to get honks from behind, and the thing will still fly off the dash and onto the floor.The dashboard mount also places the GPS farther away, making it harder to reach than if it were mounted under the rearview mirror."
5,Friction mount works,"I bought this because I got tired of constantly trying to get the suction cup mount to stay up on the window and it is surprisingly stable on my VW Passat dashboard. It makes it easy to put up the GPS and take it down again with each use. Highly recommended, especially if you live where thieves target cars where there may be a GPS."
2,Still slides around,"I bought the Garmin GPS for my wife's minivan, but we never use it because it's not readily accessible like the factory built-in GPS in my car. We were unable to find a flat spot in the minivan for the glue-down disc that came with the Garmin unit. This no-skid dashboard mount was supposed to solve the problem. The Ford Windstar minivan's dashboard deck has a textured friction surface, so I had high hopes. Still it slipped around too much for my wife to use it. And no, it's not the way she drives that causes the slips.May we'll try one of those air vent mounts, but I'm really tired of spending money on a device that never gets used."
3,Nuvi 660 Holder: Just OK for me,The only reason I bought this was that the holder on my original model snapped off a piece that holds it to the suction cup on the window. As a result mine can fall off the window in transit especially on bumpy roads. I got this as a solution and it looks like it works well with a good coupling unit. As mine is broken I will have to shell out another $40 for another coupling unit as they dont sell it as a part. An unfair rating but in my mind this unit should come with an extra attachment for the money.
5,LOVE IT!,This item is EXCELLENT! I was so fustrated with the GPS always falling off the windshield. This product is the PERFECT answer. BUY IT!
5,Useful Friction Mount For Garmin Nuvi,"This product is very easy to assemble and disassemble, in record time. The friction holds it in-place securely, even when making steep turns at high speed. The portability allows you to take it down and hide it when parked. Its flexibility allows you to dynamically adjust it to proper viewing angle. No tell-tale on windshield, and no marks on dash. A really functional product without any exertion whatsoever."
5,Garmen Friction Mount,"This is a great product that works. Simple to set up, easy to move around yet stays where you put it! I have been using this for two weeks now and have had no problems what-so-ever. Not that it would influence your buying decision but it was nice to just open the delivery box and it was ready to install - no tearing it out of a plastic bubble."
1,It falls quite a bit,"I bought this thinking it would be better to have my GPS unit in the dash. Since I keep mine plugged in, I wanted something where the cord wouldn't get in the way. But I keep having problems every time I need to do a quick acceleration. The whole thing flies off the dashboard right into my gear shifter. I keep waiting for the one time it will actually break my GPS unit, because the beanbag part is so heavy. It often lands, screen-down, onto the shifter. I am thinking about getting one of those latex rubber dash pads to put underneath of it for more gripping power. Actually, I am disappointed that the underside is not already lines with latex instead of the neoprene material they use, which is by comparison to latex, quite slippery."
5,We own 3 Now!,We have bought 3 of these now. Everyone in our family loves them. My brother and mom now have one to. It's great. Why AMAZON do I have to write 20 words minimum for a review? WTF? Cost you not me room to store all this!
4,Great mount,"Like others have said, it is a little bulky and can be tricky to hide but I much prefer it to the suction cup mount. It does not slide and is easy to move from car to car without leaving any trace that there is a GPS in the car."
5,Thumbs up!,Very stable. Not as huge as I thought it would be. I put it in the ashtray area of our Pilot and it fits great in it.I did read a lot of reviews on various mounts and this one had the best rating/comments. I have used it for about a month and it has worked out great. It does work with the Garmin 5.
4,Garmin Friction Mount,"Works well, Did not like one stuck to my windshield. This is easier to deal with than trying to get it to stick or get it off of windshield."
5,Pleased,I was pleased to discover that the stem comes off the pad and fits my old 2610 dash mount so I didn't have to use the disc and suction mount that came with the 765t...this is much more stable and secure!
3,Not very Impressed,"I bought this item with my Garmin 350 GPS, but was not very impressed. It works ok but the size is too big and takes too much room on dash board. Space on dash board is not an issue but doesn't look nice while it is on dash board. It has good weight and wouldn't move while driving, which is its best feature. The manufacturer should think about reducing its size, since its a nice idea."
4,return policy,The return policy for shipping this product is totally unaccetable. Why would I want to purchase 2 of these. I should have been alerted to this purchase before accepting. I know damn well it didn't cost you $13 to ship this product.
3,Advantages,The dashboard mount works well in the summer time when the heat in the car casues the suction mount to fall off of the windshield. The dashboard mount is also portable in moving it from one car to another. It can be more easily placed out of sight when car is parked in public areas where anyone may be tempted to make your Navigator their own.It does stay secure on the dashboard when driving and does not slide around. Does take up a footprint on the dash but there is always a price to pay.The price on Amazon was better than ordering it straight from the manufacturer.
3,"May be great, but...",Make certain you have enough room on the dash for the foot to fit. It takes a lot of room to work properly.
1,Extremely heavy,This Friction Mount is estremely heavy. It is not suitable to carry in your suitcase.The other model without sand is much better.
3,great while it lasted,This device held my Nuvi 1450 in place very well and I was pleased with its stability. My only complaint is that after about six months of very limited use it self destructed - what ever the manufacturer used to hold it together seemed to let loose and the holder was rendered unusable. I was forced to 'deep six' it.
3,"Works fine, but...","I drive an Infiniti, and this product does not fit my dash, and it hides the clock and indoor/outdoor temperatures. So I just set it up theren - kind of hangs over the edge - and then move it if I need to see the clock and/or gauges."
3,Who Knows,"I didn't get to use this product in my tests of the Garmin Nuvi 350 last week because everything came in the Garmin box that we needed. The pad seems to be sturdy, and appears to be able to stay in place on the dash, but I never felt the need to use it, hence the three stars."
1,Map upgrade for Garmin STREETPILOT c550,I purchased the map upgrade for my c550 about a week ago. The cost was $79 and thusfar I can't tell any difference though it was listed as an upgrade for my unit.
1,"Product probably good, Amazon is awful","Ordered this to go with a Nuvi 360 being shipped by a friend as a gift. The GPS unit was supposed to have arrived a week ago, but Amazon is still giving my friend the bs of ""wait a few more days"". The GPS and this bean bag both showed in tracking info that they were shipped from the same location, but the bean bag arrived 2 days after ordering, the GPS still has not arrived (2 weeks since ordering, over 1 week later than scheduled). Returned the bean bag today, and told my friend to simply cancel the order on the GPS, and will not order from Amazon again. If you screw up, FIX IT!"
1,Wrong Item Sent!,"I am very disappointed with my purchase with Electronics Expo. I ordered the Portable Friction Mount for my Garmin Nuvi 260 and they sent the ""Auto Dash Mount"" which isn't even close to what I ordered! It's a piece of plastic that looks like a replacement mount for the one that comes with my GPS. Now I have to deal with the headache of returning it which I probably won't end up doing because the mount that I originally wanted cost $23.88 +$6.00 SH&H for a total of $29.88. It'll cost me even more money to send it back. All I just wanted was for Electronics Expo to send me the correct product that I ordered!"
1,Not Worth the money,"Garmin Portable Friction Mount for Nuvi, StreetPilot I Series & C530, C550 (010-10908-00)"
5,way better then I thought,"I'm going to be short and concise ,I just traveled about 3000 miles and this device is great , contrary to what some reviews said it did held up beautifully on my dodge,granted on some rough roads in mexico it did slide of position a little bit ,but even me I was sliding of my seat, all on all so worth it ..and like some one recommended if you need extra steadiness cut a little piece of foam mat ,I didn't need it ...good buy ,handy practical ,thumbs up"
4,Didn't fit my Unit right,"The Dashboard Mount is an excellant product, though for whatever reason the ball on the end of the one I bought didn't fit the OEM cradle on my Garmin, every time I used the touch screen it moved, it was annoying, I had it one day and returned it the next. I gave it 4 stars because stayed on the dashboard never moved, good solid product, easy to use, mine was probably defective."
5,awesome solution for suction cup,This product seems more stuck the dash than the suction cup to the window. I had no problem with recommeding this to any person using the garmin its the way to go for navigation.
5,Awesome GPS Mount,"I purchased this mount for my Nuvi 350. With a newer vehicle, I didn't want to use the window mount (that supposibly melts) or the dash mount that would leave sticky stuff or ruin my vehicle.This product had 5 stars so I gave it a try. It works like a charm. I keep mine on the left side of the dash in the corner. Seems to be out of the way and doesn't obstruct my view...also fits perfectly like it was made to be there. Has 4 bean bags that act as weights and it doesn't move an inch. Much better solution for anyone who doesn't want to risk ruining their car windshield or dash. So easy to use in any car incase you switch vehicles.One of the best ""gadgets"" I have bought. If anything were to happen to it, I'd be buying another one immediately."
3,Good while it lasts,"Bought a few back and it was just dandy, at first. About a year or two after the bottom no longer gripped and slid around all the time; I suppose that is just what happens with time."
4,"Nicely made, but not perfect for my needs.","This is very nicely made and holds the Nuvi bracket well. My only complaint, since I like to mount the GPS unit on my center console [keep it out of sight and out of sun] is that I cannot tilt the unit upward enough. For a dash-mount, I'm not sure you could do much better. Since the suction cup mounts are not the most reliable, especially in this Texas summer heat, having the ball secured to the base is a huge benefit of this item."
5,Great accessory,"I bought my husband a Garmin Nuvi GPS for his birthday and he and a friend took it for a trial run on a five-hour drive ""up north."" The suction-cup window mount that comes with the Nuvi is annoying, at best, because it doesn't stay adhered to the windshield the way it should (whose windshield, really, is as clean as it should be, right?).So when I told him this dashboard mount was available instead, he jumped at the idea and we ordered one immediately. We have used it several times since it arrived. The GPS connects securely to the mount via a ball-and-socket-style system, yet we're able to swivel the GPS quickly and easily. The dashboard mount is heavy and ""grippy"" enough that it stays put on the dashboard, even during sharp turns. We love this accessory and the ease of its use ... and as a result, we use our GPS more often--even just for fun, when we actually know where we're going."
5,great purchase,"I purchased the Garmin friction mount for my c550 gps. It's great. I place it on my dashboard, no suction cups or anything. This mount just sits there and DOES NOT MOVE. The unit attaches and comes off in a matter of seconds. This way I can hide my gps and nobody is the wiser. Great idea,"
5,This is absolute must for Garmin Nuvi 760,This keeps Nuvi solidly in place even on my husband's steep slope dashboard. The mount that comes with Nuvi 760 is not very good at all. I also like how this mount enables you to just quickly and easily disconnect the Nuvi and pop it in your purse and just stow the cord and mount on the floor out of sight with no suction cup tell-tale ring.
5,Convenient and Simple,"This was a gift to my husband. He found it simple, stays in place, easy to use, remove and set up, does not fall or slide, is not cumbersome or too large. He loves it."
4,Garmin dash mount,"This was recommended when I purchased the GPS, and I'm glad I listened to the recommendation. Using the weighted dash board mount saves time and is much more convenient than the suction mount (like when you have to roll down your window for tolls). I liked the sale price, too!"
4,ok,It works well. The unit does not move while driving- I could not take the suction cups that come with the unit when purchased.
4,"Garmin, Portable Friction Mount","This friction mount was exactly what I needed--no permanent mounting, which might reveal to others that a GPS was in the car. Very easy to simply put into place where yu wantit to be."
5,Garmin Friction Mount,Garmin Friction Mount works great for me on top of the dash. It doesn't move. I think it is better then the other Garmim semi sticky mount that can collect dirt.
5,Solved my problem!,"I love this product! I don't worry about whether the GPS is going to come crashing down on me anymore. As soon as I tried this, I got rid of the windshield mount."
5,Garmin Friction Mount,"I wanted something to use with my gps without having to put it on my windshield. I hate the little ring marks it leaves when you take it down. I was a bit skeptical about the dash mount, but after reading many remarks and feedbacks about it I decided to try it. I am quite pleased with it. Its nothing to add the gps to the mount and placing it on the dash. I wondered if it would tilt over, but after testing it on a few steep curves, it stayed!!! If this is somethin you are thinking about buying, I would definately recommend it!"
2,Too Rigid,"My dashboard has a high hump in the middle, and this Garmin mount is too rigid to conform to its shape. Only the center of it comes in contact with my dash. I'm afraid it might go flying if I have to stop suddenly. My previous Garmin dash mount (for the Street Pilot) was much more flexible and conformed to my dash perfectly. Unfortunately, the Nuvi doesn't fit into it. I'm seriously considering cutting my losses and buying a generic mount."
5,Great anchor for my GPS phone,"I recently purchased the Garmin portable friction mount to use with my Garmin ASUS phone during a family road trip to California. Delivery was quick and the product worked exactly as intended. Despite the variety of driving conditions (highway, city, stop-and-go, etc.), the friction mount stayed in place and did not move from my dash unless I physically moved it. It is a great product."
4,Works great in the RV,I bought this our RV. We have only used it once on a long trip. The portable friction mount is nice for use in the RV because mounting it on the windshield is very awkward and because the windows are so big it is harder to see the map on the screen. We were able to place the mount on the dashboard and set it up for easy access. The mount did not move from the original location. So far it has worked great.
3,It does the job,"What can I say? I bought this accessory to a gift (Garmin GPS) for a family member who said , after having connected both items and placing them on the dash of his Town & Country, that the base moved ""just a little"" while driving, but that it remained stable for the most part."
5,It does the job,"Never thought a friggin' sand bag would serve as a GPS mount but lol, I guess whatever works.This thing is great, you just put it on the dash board anywhere you want. The friction surface on the back basically sticks to any position you put it.Works as intended, for the price... yeah it's worth it."
2,Good for a while,"I bought this four years ago. It worked fairly well but far from perfectly. As time went on, it became less stable. Now, it will send any navigator flying on any sharp turn. For the price, I expected better. The foam surface at the bottom becomes smooth over time, and then it becomes a very expensive bean bag.If you want to stop it from slipping, you can use something such asBig Horn Tool Box Liner, but if you need to add your own liner, I can't see any way to justify spending triple what the AmazonBasics equivalent friction mount cost."
4,Weighted pads are a bit stiff so doesn't form to the curves of my dash ...,It does work very well and has a nice heft to it. But my dash in my car is very curvy in the corner where I put this wit the GPS. And the problem I have is that the 4 weighted pads are very stiff so that it doesn't form to the surface very well. 90% of the time this is never a problem but I have had it slip a bit now and then.
5,Garmon Friction mount,"This is a great product. It is the perfect size. It is adjustable, and the ball socket swivels. Small enough to put in the glove compartment. Works great! Perfect alternative to the windsheild mount suction cups. I highly recommend it."
3,Works well for about a year,"This works well for about a year, then, unfortunately, the friction at the bottom tends to wear, and it starts to slide all over your dash. I have tried everything to get it to stay, but it's become a pain. The best solution now has been to put saliva under where it sits, to make it stick a little. Worse in the winter when your dash is cold and slicker. For what they charge for this, you're probably better off going with an aftermarket generic."
5,Fast and Easy,This works well for our Garmin. It is easy to setup and quick to take off the dash. Beware if you accelerate too fast as it may slip off the dash.
5,It Works,"Received almost before I ordered it; got free shipping with Prime, and it works great on both dashboards. Fits under passenger seat to hid it when not using. but I put it in a plastic bag just to help the bottom stay tacky.Didn't know it was illegal for me to use window suction cupped holder on window in CA until read review (one of the cars had no real usable spot anyway, which is why I was looking.)I absolutely endorse this for my model of Garmin which was listed in the description of product on the site. Good Luck."
2,no good,This produte could be good if it could stay on dashboard but it keeps sliding all over the place when u make turns.So in my opinion no good.
3,Garmin Portable Mount,"I lost the windshield mount that came with my Garmin Nuvi 350. I wanted to get away from the windhshield mount with tell tale suction cup circle (sure sign you have a GPS) The friction mount made sense in that it would be easy to set up and take down. I didn't realize or note, that the mounting clip that attaches the Garmin to the friction mount wasn't included. My Garmin model has been discontinued so obtaining that important part has been an interesting and somewhat costly adventure. But now that I have ALL the parts I'm thinking that I am going to really like this item cause driving around with the Garmin in my lap hasn't been working for me! It isn't easy to toss into the glove compartment as it is a bulkly and doesn't fold down, but all in all, I'm satisfied!"
5,Awesome,"I should of bought this sooner, it is great to have and I wish I would of bought it when I first got my Nuvi. Works perfectly, very stable and quality made."
4,re/Garmin mount,"My Garmin mount arrived from AMAZON even before the GPS did, but only by a couple of days. As soon as the GPS arrived I snapped it together and took it to my car and off we went. Mount is very sturdy, no problems going around corners or on bumpy roads. I am very satisfied."
5,Garmin Portable Dash Mount for Nuvi,"Purchased for use with Nuvi 350 after original suction cup failed. Works great in either of my vehicles. Doesn't move at all, and easy to put away when I reach destination. Can be moved to any flat location in the vehicle. Actually works nicely as a storage unit in house when GPS is not in use for a trip."
5,Garmin Portable Friction Dashboard Mount for Nuvi GPS,"I couldn't be happier with this beanbag mount. It is so much more convenient than mounting your GPS with the suction cup. The unit can easily be lifted off the dash to more easily key in your destination, or to move from auto to home or auto to auto. It stays securely in place where ever you put it. Highly recommended, and Amazon seems to have the best deal on it."
5,Never falls off,"This is the 2nd one I've purchased (this was a gift to my nephew). In my last 5 yrs of using it I've been very satisfied. All road bumps do is move my GPS a little on my dashboard, a minor problem that I can easily address while driving. The beanbag mount also allow me to easily hide my GPS when I go into the stores. Definitely, well worth the money."
5,Garmin Portable Friction Mount - Frustration Free Packaging,"Who wants to display their GPS on a suction cup in the windhield and advertise til it gets stolen? Don't by a GPS without this ""bean bag"" mount. It makes your GPS portable. It does not slide around or fall off your dash. Worth it."
4,friction mount,1. this mount is wery good and we recomend it to anyone who wants to buy it with one exception it is slightly overpiced but if you want a good productyou will probably pay more
5,Garmin Portable Friction Mount,"Our son recommended this item to us when we purchased a Garmin GPS 760 approx. 3 years ago. It has worked so well for us that we recently purchased a second one for our Grand Daughter to use with our old GPS after we received a new Garmin 2555 as a gift. It is easy to use, remains on the dash where placed and can be transported easily to where ever you may want to put it."
5,Fantastic Product!,"This dashboard mount does a fantastic job of keeping the Garmin Nuvi 350 resting solidly on the dash. The mount doesn't move even when driving over a bump; it stays right where you put it. I like the fact too that I can put the mount along with the GPS in my console when I am not using it. I've heard of people breaking a car window when they saw a mount for a GPS on the window, even if the GPS was not visible. Thieves figure if you have the mount, the GPS may be in the car so they break in to find it. With this mount no one has a clue there is a GPS in the car!"
5,GOOD,Really good product. Stay there very stable and direction can be adjust very well. Now I can use my GPS every day and dont worry it falling off from the window.
2,Didn't fit my device,I think this could have been a good item because it allows you to put the gps anywhere that suits you. It was difficult for me to use. I showed it to 3 different people and they all said it wouldn't work with my GPS which I wish I would have known because I purchased it at the same time as my GPS online and it was RECOMMENDED for use with my GPS.
5,Really Sticks to the Dash,"My old suction cup kept falling off. This ""bean bag"" style holder has made my GPS a pleasure to use. Love this product."
4,Garmin,This item was exactly as promised at a very good price. It was also packaged very well and came in the time expected.
4,Honda Civic 2007,"I use this mount in a Honda Civic 2007. While it has not fallen off the dashboard (which is not flat in the 2007 Civic), it does move around a bit whenever I hit a bump and I find myself reaching over to make minor adjustment from time-to-time. It also leaves marks and lint on the dashboard which is caused by the materials used to construct the Civic dashboard. I have not found that to be a problem in other cars.I've found that it can be placed in the storage bin beneath the radio which gives the device a built-in look and is convenient to the power and radio input plugs. It also makes it easier to discretely remove the device after parking. The only downside is that one has to glance downward to view the device. But I prefer that to making adjustments every time I hit a bump in the road."
1,Starts off great and gets slippery after a few months,I have had several of these and they all start out great but the bottom smooths out after a while and the unit slips all over the place. It becomes very dangerous to use. Garmin has even replaced two at no charge and the new ones did the same thing. I like all the other features of the mount but the slipping problem makes it dangerous and eventually not usable.
4,Does not move!,"Between the heft and the rubbery bottom surface, this Garmin mount will not move! The little beanbags on the 4 corners adjust to the shape of your dashboard. We tested it by setting the mount on a trunk and opening the trunk lid. We achieved an 80 DEGREE tilt before it even started to move! It also fits in the storage space between the front seats in my car. If you have a small glove compartment or not a lot of storage, you may need to hide it under your car seat. But we should all be hiding our GPS mounts anyway, so that our cars don't get broken into. We had bad luck with our old suction cup mount after a while, especially trying to use it in a rental car. This will be much easier and cleaner! So glad I got this."
5,Love it.,I can place the item closer to me and it doesn't move no matter how fast I take a turn or slam on the brakes. Since I have only one good eye and that eye has floaties all over the friggin place I need the Garmin close so I can spot the current location at the precise moment when the floaties move to where I get a clear view. It's a great product.
3,Doesn't work for all cars,"I have a 2007 MINI Cooper S, and this mount slides on my dash. It moves a little bit during normal driving, but it completely slides off my dash under any kind of acceleration or sharp turning. The dash is textured, which may contribute to this. I realize this situation will not apply to everyone, but if you have a MINI S, using it for what it was made for means this mount won't work. I'm not talking about crazy road racing; just more than normal acceleration or turning."
4,MUY UTIL,"Es muy facil de usar, un poco incomodo para guardarlo, facil de ubicar en el auto. Hay que tener cuidado porque un sobresalto puede hacerlo caer."
4,Dashboard mount works great,"As a California resident, we cannot affix a GPS to the windshield. This makes a great alternative. It really does stay in place. It should come with some instructions, however, as I had to call Garmin to find out how to mount the GPS. It's not complicated but neither is it very intuitive."
4,Garmin Nuvi 660 and Friction Mount,"I like this friction mount ever since I purchased it for my Garmin Nuvi 660. It works great and is very stable. There is only one issue I have with the part that connects to the base; it is a bit short. The height causes the car power cable to bend sharply(kink) and could ultimately damage the car charger cable. The height needs to be increased about 3/4"" (.75 inch)."
4,Excellent product,Very practical and stays wherever you put it on the dash board and easy to take it to any car and I already suggested it to a friend of mine to get one for herself and she ordered it and is waiting for it. Thanks. Jose.
4,This thing is Huge!,"This thing is way bigger than I thought! It should work pretty well, stays on there with no slip or so. However, if I put it in the middle of my car's top pannel, it blocks the AC fan, so i have to put it in the left corner now. Also since this thing is actually relatively big, it's hard to hide it in the car, so it won't prevent people from knowing I might have a GPS in my car, so i don't know why people think this prevent steeling. Overall i like it a lot especially in this coming winter."
2,Base is too large and rigid,"Attachment to GPS is fine but the ""bean bag"" base is not Garmin. Large metal cross in base makes it tippy and vibrate unless jammed between dash and windshield. Also unwieldy for packing on trips. Will keep for convenience but would not purchase again. Puts a big hunk of metal up on the dash in your face - safety concern."
5,Garmin mount,"After breaking 3 Garmin-produced windshield mounts, I purchased this item and it works great. It securely holds my GPS, is readily adjusted, and can be quickly removed to hide the GPS if necessary."
5,Great Accessory for Garmin GPS,This mount is great for my Garmin nuvi GPS. No rings on the windshield and easy to throw in the glovebox when you leave the car.
5,Awesome!!,This product does everything it says it does. Clip on your GPS and lay it on your dashboard and your GPS will never slide or move even with sharp turns or bumps.
5,Worsk great,"This works great- I found the windshield mount distracting and once it fell off while driving. This works beautifully, doesn't shift and easy to transport between cars. The price on Amazon is the best I found."
5,OK for a Garmin GPS receiver......,This device is pretty obviously simple. It works well for a GPS receiver. I primarily wanted to adapt it for a camera mount (which I did). Not good for this use in a moving vehicle: too much movement in the center piece. **sigh**.....It's a GPS mount.
4,Garmin Dashboard Mount,Amazon had great price for what is an overpriced Garmin product. Product arrived on time and packaged perfectly.
5,Really works!,"I was a little unsure if it would work like it was supposed to, but it was very stable and very user friendly! Can take it down and put it back in place very quickly!"
1,Unhappy with friction mount and windshield mount.,"Round ball on hook does not fit Garmin Nuvi 350 receptacle, neither does the windshield mount round hook. Reported this to Amazon and all they did was give me another (Garmin) site to report it and there was no way to do so; have to make a phone call.Not happy."
3,Arizona Trip,"We found the Garmin to be a handy little device even though we did not follow all the directions. In one case, it led us into a deadend street which is not easy to correct when you are driving an RV and pulling a vehicle on a tow dolly. Finding RV parks and certain types of stores was very nice."
2,Contains harmful chemicals,"Fine print on packaging:Warning: This product, its packaging, and its components contain chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects, or reproductive harm..."
4,Stays in place.,Doesn't move around. Easy to move from vehicle to vehicle. I liked not having to struggle with clam shell packaging.
4,Universal base Makes changing vehicles easy,Good quality base.Easy to take from vehicle to vehicle If you are driving different cars this is the answer!Have used before You cant go wrong
4,garmin portable friction mount,"Recently i had purchased Garmin Nuvii 660. I was unable to mount on windshield as it is illegal in state of California. I did not want to use the disk to mount on dashboard, as it would leave a gross mark on my new van. I learnt about friction mount, I was skeptical about its efficiency; but I must admit, it is a great product. It does not move or budge from its place even with sharp turns. Moreover, as its name implies, it is portable, you can move your GPS from one vehicle to another. The only disadvantage is its ugly looking."
4,Works great if dash has room,"I first used a Garmin GPS and portable friction dashtop mount on a business trip. It was such a great convenience that upon my return home I bought a Nuvi 350 and the dashtop mount. The mount sticks well to just about any surface, making it easy to rely on your GPS for guidance. It's also convenient.You can store it and your Nuvi under the seat or in the trunk upon arriving to your destination, a great theft deterrent. However, the dash on my car is rather limited in space. The windshield is raked back and there is very little clearance. If I take off too abruptly, my Nuvi falls off. This is due to my car's interior more than the dash mount. It works really well if you have the space. A really great product!"
5,Should be the mount supplied with the GPS,My husband has a Garmin C530 and I purchased this mount for him due to him having complaints with the mount supplied with the unit. He loves this mount and it has worked really well for him without any issues. He feels that this should be the mount supplied with the GPS unit and highly recommends it.
5,garmin portable friction mount for nuvi-350 is the best.,"the window mount came with the unit, they don't last long, I switch the car to car 4-5 times, they are gone, especially in florida weather, less than one month the rubber mount melt, the portable friction mount has no problem, I can put everywhere on the dash for easy to reach, I love it.sid"
1,Happy consumer,I was sooo tired of the windshield suction cup failing and trying to catch my Garmin as it was falling. This base unit was a terrific purchase and it is a superb product. Wish I was the inventor! The shipping was FAST too!
1,Disappointed,"It slid all over his Dashboard every time he rounded a curve. Needless to say, we are both disapointed about this product. I bought this for a good friend as a christmas gift. At first he was very excited to finally get one, until he used it. I wouldnt buy another"
5,Great way to mount you Garmin unit,"This is the best method that I have found to keep a Garmin unit in your car. The windshield methods can attract thieves because of the ring they leave behind not to mention eventually your unit can fall down. Its also illegal to have your GPS mounted to our windshield in some states mainly CA.This thing doesn't move during sharp turns at all and is very stable. However, I did notice that when I placed it in my brothers car it flew off the dashboard that was because he recently used a cleaner on his dashboard. With certain types of dashboard cleaners/polishers it has a hard time gripping the dashboard (he uses Armor All wipes). Not sure if that means you can't use any kind of product on your dash with this product, but that was my experience in his car. It only flew off the dashboard when he made a fairly sharp turn at 40 mph otherwise it was fine.It is built to last I have been using mine for over 2 years now and it still looks brand new."
4,It works,The GPS stays in place where ever you put it because the mount has some weight to it.Being reasonably big is the downside to it.
5,Can't live without this!,"We purchased this at the same time we bought the Garmin because we know someone else who had this, and we could see the value. We love it!"
1,Could be very dangerous product,"The idea is good however, the product did not live up to the idea. This product could easily fly off the dashboard and hit the driver or the passenger right in the face. And if it hits the driver [while driving of course] you could very much count on an accident to happen and more people could get hurt. Of course it looks pretty while the car is not moving. In conclusion, I would not recommend this product at all; the maker has to improve on it a whole lot before it becomes practical and safe."
3,"didn'tfit, my mistake","I made a mistake, not compatible with my GPS. I would have needed on one of these for a Magellan, not a Garmin."
1,Beware,"The photo is misleading, it doesn't come with the arm that attaches to your gps holder/cradle and the bean bag mount. Assumed it did and all I had to do was remove the Garmin unit cradle from the suction cup mount that came with my unit and snap it on the arm the photo shows, or slide the suction cup mount into the beanbag base... Nope... Shame on me for not reading the description fully, but it is misleading."
1,"Slides, loses traction after 6 months","Like others have noted, the thing is perfect for the first few months and then the foam bottom gets less ""sticky"" over time. I don't use any armor all or anything but windex on the dash. The foam just loses its ability to grip. What helps is scratching the foam up to restore the grip. But...you can only do that so often before you are left with no more foam."
2,NO REFUND!!!!,"I had decided to not purchase the Garmin Friction Mount and relayed this to the seller. They asked me to return the item (which I did), and have STILL not received my refund. They sent ""multiple"" emails (which I have copies of all...they were ""busy"" and would get back to me). HOW do I get my refund??Respectfully,Tom Whiteley"
4,"Works Great, No slipping","This mount works very well, without slipping. It's simple to set-up, easy to use. The arm makes it a bit awkward to store, but all-in all a very good, sturdy mount. I'd buy it again if needed."
5,Excellent base for the Garmin GPS,"This stays where you put it on the dash. I like the portable features to either place it on the floor out of the sun and sight, or in a second vehicle. It is the only way I mount my Garmin."
1,Unnecessary product,"the way the garmin was listed one thought that this mount was necessary. However, you do not need this. The Garmin comes with a perfectly acceptable mount."
1,Too large for the dash,Takes up too much space for the dashboard unless you want to cover up your clock and exterior temperature etc.
4,Seems really good,"I did some looking around amazon for a good mount because the one you get is really crappy. It's hard to wedge it in there and I know if you stuck it to your windshield it'd pop off sooner or later. I bought this because the reviews looked good. When I got it I was a bit surprised. The bottom has this sticky foam pad texture, which is pretty nice. There are metal beads in the four corners, which I'm not sure are magnetic or not, but it's really heavy, that's for sure. What I like about the mount is it seems very friction free, and the piece that actually connects the GPS to the mount turns and locks. Seems very sturdy. I'm not sure how well this will hold up in my car. I don't want it to fall off my dashboard after some time, but maybe it won't. It's definitely worth trying."
5,Love it!,"Never thought we needed one of these but after a recent trip where the GPS (not Garmin)kept falling off the window, decided to give it a try when we bought our new Garmin nuvi 255w. Love it! Easy to use, never slides, Garmin is closer than when on the windshield and therefore easier for me, the ""co-pilot"" to program, and it easily changes vehicles with us. I would definitely recommend this!"
4,dashboard mount,"It is easy to place in different vehicles and put in different places, but it does seem to slide on my dash after an a few hours more than I thought it might......................"
4,"Works well, but not on every dashboard",The portable mount works well on the dashboard on in Scion tC but it does slide around some on my Chevy Suburban.
3,"Good product, just wish it had height adjustment","This product does what it's intended to do. Sits on the dash and holds up my Garmin GPS. For my car, I just wish it didn't hold the GPS unit so high. The base is a bit larger than it looks on the pictures."
5,Garmin Portable Friction Mount - works perfectly in all of our vehicles!,I recommend this mount for every vehicle with a large enough dash surface area for the base. It provides a stable mount & is easily hidden for security when away from the vehicle.
5,WORKS GREAT!,"Works great, doesn't move, and allows me to put my Garmin under-the-seat when not in use, or parking--making it less of a target for theft."
5,Fantastic,This thing is fantastic. It doesn't move. At all. It stays where you put it. Looks great with the GPS too. Highly recommended.
4,Great product,Works as it should. Doesn't move on the dashboard. Steady and a perfect height. I would definitely recommend this mount.
5,terrific,"really likes the dashmount for my garmin, it was so easy to put away ,out of sight in the van. from one quilt shop to another, you don't want it to be in the way. Amazon is a great web sight to order from.ThanksBobbie"
5,Great addition!,This simple little device solves the problem of mounting your Garmin Nuvi and secures the Nuvi for optimum visibility and use.
4,Sand bagged,Many states prohibit use of a window suction cup mount for GPS and other devices. Although this is essentially a glorified sandback with a mounting bracket it works quite well and rarely slides around on the dash.
5,Works great,So far this has worked well and it makes it very easy to pull the GPS out of sight and hide it on the floor making my car a less tempting target for GPS thieves.
5,"Great, but bulky",This product works exactly as described. I was looking for something for my wife to use that would not leave the rings on the windshield like a suction mount. It fits perfectly in a lot of places on the dash and stays where you put it. The only set back is there are no places to store it easily as the mat is quite bulky.
5,A must have!,"If you are like me. You love your Garmin...but you hate how you have to stick it to the window. This Portable Friction Mount, or what I like to call...the bean-bag mount is the answer. I makes it very easy to move between all 3 of my cars fast. I have recommended it for all of my friends with Garmin's and everyone is very happy with it. Just got a new one for my dad. I just wish you did not have to buy it separate, I think it should come with it since it is so easy to use and almost a necessity."
4,1490T,"I recently bought a 1490T and after my friends car was broken into for her GPS I decided I wouldn't even bother installing a windshield mount. I bought this mount with ""frustration free packaging"" and it wasn't exactly frustration free. It didn't come with any directions. I had to go back to the product page here and look at user submitted photos to figure out if I was missing pieces or not! Luckily I figured it out, grabbed the Garmin holder that came with my GPS and attached it to the GPS. Then I had to take the round piece off the mount before attaching it to my GPS to get enough leverage to get it on there(push hard) and then reattach it to the mount. So the setup was a little frustrating without any directions but I can't wait to use it!"
5,Fantastic solution,"These days, with GPS's becoming more desirable to steal from cars, we wanted to remove the window mount the GPS came with. I also don't use the GPS all the time, and wanted to be able to take it with me when I travelled, to save on costs when renting a car.This does all of this :) I can hide it in my glove box when it's not in use.It is a little bulky, so you may lose some space in the storage bins in your car, but it is a great solution."
3,okay but not perfect,this thing works great most of the time. the only time i do have an issue is when i accelerate from a stop up a hill or take a turn sharper than i should. this falls off the dash at those times. the window mount that came with the unit used to fall off when it was hot out so this is definitely better. may i will try some sticky tack and see if that will keep it a little more secure in those edge cases.
3,Best on a flat surface.,Works well in some vehicles but tends to slide around in other vehicles. Best of a flat surface. I would get a different one for my van next time.
4,Great buy for hot weather living,"My suction cup mount just wasn't cutting it in the hot FL sun. Despite the angular configuration of my dashboard, this friction mount stays right where I need it to be and doesn't lose it's grip around it's grip while going around tight corners. The arm that attaches to my Nuvi is great because it has much more freedom of movement than the suction cup mount offered. I can angle the screen for optimal viewing with ease. My only complaint is that it's bulky and difficult to hide while I'm out of my vehicle."
4,AWESOME!,"I was a bit skeptical about this mount but after using it for the 1st time, all I can say is amazing!!! It does not move from where you place it, not mater how fast or tight a turn you take. The only problem is that it is a bit big and bulky so not easy to hide."
5,Great little friction mount!,This mount is very easy to use and EXTREMELY stable - does not move at all! I did not want to mount my Nuvi to the windshield and my dash is funky. Bought this and could not be happier! Get one - you will not be sorry!
5,Just what I wanted,"This is exactly what I was looking for... a ""portable"" mount that I can switch from one car to the other."
5,Good choice for GPS,I am very happy to have the portable friction for my Garmin GPS device. It is much easier to setup the device on the dashboard than in the windshield. No marks left on the glass and I can put it in the glove compartment no issues. In addition I am able to comply with the traffic regulations that is prohibiting to mount the GPS on the windshield. Last but not least it is easier to move from car to car.
5,Good to go!!,"I thought this would only be used on long trips but I never remove my Nuvi 350 from the mount because it's way more convenient than I had imagined. I drive a 2005 Honda Civic and I grease the dash down with Armorall pretty good ... this mount does not slip. I drive like a complete idiot too, according to my wife and kids, so they give this thing props for staying put too. Speaking of Armorall, it does leave a dry spot on the dash; I guess that's the ""footprint"" some other people were talking about, but if you don't grease it down like me then that won't happen. If you get a Nuvi GPS and you're curious about the best method for keeping the thing in one place, this is your answer. I stuffed all the little suction cups and double-sided tape in a drawer because this is all a guy (or gal) needs."
5,Great Product,"This portable mount is great for those of us who are afraid to attach a disk to the dash with the mount included by Garmin. This type also allows my wife to use the Nuvi when she would like. It performs flawlessly, staying put even when curves are taken faster than they should."
4,Best Solution for Cars with non sticky dashboard,"I have been using Bracketron friction mount for around 2 years in my leased Nissan Altima which was working good.I was in need for a second one for Garmin 255w as i end up using the Bracketron for XM radio. One problem was the non sticky surface of the dashboard and the second was that since it was leased car i didn't want to loose any signs of scratch/ tear marks on the dashboard. I was using the suction cup mount that came with the Garmin, but it detaches frequently especially when there is an extreme change in temperature/weather. I went ahead and purchased the garmin friction mount. It was easy to setup ( i got the amazon frustration free packaging). GPS is easy to slide in and take off. Its slightly bigger in size as compared to the one that i had. I purchased my first Garmin GPS in Nov 2004 and was glad to see the same locking mechanism used in that GPS. Overall i will rate it 4 stars."
5,Flexible GPS mount,"The mount rests securely on the dash and can be easily relocated on the dash for easier visibility. The actual mount can be turned left or right, and allows the GPS unit to be tilted up or down. After arriving at destination, the GPS is easily removed from the mount unit, or the entire unit can be safely stored."
4,Garmin Portable Friction Mount,"Pros: Will not fall off you window like the suction mount, does not ""advertise"" to every one that you are using a GPS.Cons: The mount may slide on your dash is you are making a sharp turn.Conclusion: Great mount if you don't want suction rings on your windshield and you remove your GPS when the car is parked."
3,does the job,"this is nice since i don't want to stick something on my dashboard or suction cup on my windshieldit does it's job, but the friction is bad. Not heavy enough. I get a little bump on the road and it shifts. It causes me to adjust it every time.I would get something heavier if i were to get another choice of ordering a mount."
3,Great for the first year,"Like many others, I was very happy with this GPS mount until it lost its 'stickum' ... after about a year, the mount slides all over the place and the GPS will go flying when I do a u-turn or roundabout. Wish there was something to refresh whatever it was that made it stay in place."
5,Must-Have Product,"This item shipped quickly and was in great condition when it arrived. A must-have for those who purchase Garmin GPS systems. While the suction cup can often be tricky, this friction mount never slides. Also, the middle stand is removable which makes it convenient for storage and/or portability."
3,"Good, but not for all typoes of driving/models","I bought this to accompany my Garmin Nuvi- 5 inch model. The product is great quality and actually really big. It will hold in place under normal circumstances. Personally, when I dive it slides and falls down off the dash multiple times. I do accelerate hard a lot but that's my type of driving. I think that paired with the Large GPS I have does not work. But even under slight acceleration it has jetted forward. The problem is that the bottom of this grip is not as good as others I have seen/used. Others us a rubber sticky method, while this one relies on sand weighted large surface diameter."
3,"Does the job, not very portable though","I borrowed my friend's once and the thing in the middle that holds the garmin would click to fold when putting it away. For this one, you have to pull that middle thing out and it's inconvenient. Not a big deal but I wish I bought the one that just folds."
2,"Does not fit all listed devices, had to discard","I bought this mount for my old Garmin Street Pilot, and it was wonderful, far superior to the original vacuum thingy that hung on the windshield. After only a couple of trips, the touch screen on my GPS went crazy and Garmin said there was nothing to do about it --- so I purchased a Nuvi 265WT. It is listed as a device that this works with, but there was no way whatever I could fit it onto the ball mount. The ball is too large. Since this is listed for that device, I don't know what to do to replace it. The way the Nuvi hangs on my windshield is very distracting, as the cord is much closer to me than it was with the Street Pilot. I have a curved dash, so I can't just use anything that sits on a normal dash. Too bad it doesn't fit all the advertised devices, as it is great when it fits.If you're thinking of buying one, I'd suggest taking your GPS to the store and making sure it fits rather than ordering online."
5,"Grippy little mount, packs small, sets up fast.","This weighty, grippy base isn't to be confused with the older model my wife has, in which you must attach the windshield suction cup to the base (yeah, it's as bad as the suction cup). This has its own stem, very positively located with clicking index on both the base and the stem, where you affix only the clip portion of the mount that came with the GPS.I don't use spray protectants on my dash (because for safety, I don't want to any light reflected off the dash), so the bag's rubber base will probably never lose its grip (it's stored broken down in my glove box between uses). The bag's four weighted extensions cover a substantial area and quickly settle in to conform to and grip the dash.It gives me my ideal placement, slightly left of mid-dash, square to my line of sight. This is my one absolutely necessary GPS accessory purchase. I actually dismissed consideration of non-Garmin units because of unavailability of this mount."
5,Works great!,I use this with a Nuvi 750 in a 2008 Odyssey. It's never slid a fraction of an inch even during hard breaking or fast turns. Plus its easy to grab it with the gps attached and put it on the floor when parked.
5,portable garmin holder,"this product works very well sitting on the dash of my work truck, the only time that I have problems with this product is when I'm on bad wash board dirt roads, but even then it holds good on the dash at slower speeds"
5,Garmin Portable Friction Mount,Great way to keep your Garmin safe while driving and not have it on the windshield.
3,"Not great, not bad.","All-in-all, it has worked well and done what it was designed to do. It seems a little bit on the big size for what is is. After about 6-8 months, you could tell that the material on the bottom that keeps it from sliding around was begining to wear out or slip a little bit, but it still holds. I got this and the suction cup for the window also, but anymore I just set the Garmin right in the cup holder in the console. It is out of the way and doesn't slide around at all and I don't have some big beanbag sitting on my dashboard."
5,great alternative to the suction cup plate,this product is so much better than the suction cup mount....my gps kept falling off the plate....now it stays in place on the dash!!!
4,Works as expected,I like the bean bag style mounts. This one is heavy enough to limit tip-overs. Seems durable enough too for the money.
5,Excellent mount,"Snaps into the nick 660 cord endpiece easily. Sits on dash without moving on. Sudden stops, curves, rough roads do not move this base. Very good mount for the Harming nick."
5,Review for Garmin Mount,I really like how portable this mount it. It really grips the dash and puts the Garmin right at eye level. It makes using my GPS much more practical.
4,Beanbag dashboard mount,"Easy to use, stays put with non friction pad, can be place anywhere on dash without leaving marks, works well with my Nuvi 660, preferred over window mounting."
5,very good product,This friction mount is very good. my dash is on quite a angle & in 1500 miles only had to push it back up in place 2 times.
5,A great product,"This mount is a great solution for anyone who wants to share the Nuvi between different vehicles. It also allows the unit to be positioned wherever it works best, for the driver or navigator. It is very stable and well designed. A 10!"
4,Great solution for getting your GPS off the window,"I bought this holder because, first of all it is against the law in Washington State to attach anything to your windshield and, secondly, because I simply could not reach the GPS unit while attached to the windshield. This is a marvelous solution. The bean bag base stays in place. I thought it might drift around a little especially with any hard cornering or stopping but it doesn't move one little bit. I am very happy with it. I guess my only complaint (and it's a small one) would be that it isn't exactly pretty. Of course it never promised to be but it certainly is functional!"
5,garmin friction bean bag WORKS,i have 2 for my own use and i purchased this one to go with my gift purchase of a garmin for my dtr. it's much more convenient and less obvious than the windshield mount that comes with the unit. easier to move from vehicle to vehicle too.
4,Good value,make sure you have a large flat area on your dash. It was about 33% larger than I expected but dose a good job.
4,No suction marks.,It works well if your dashboard it not sloped. The benifit is it does not leave marks on your wind shield the suction cups do.
4,Garmin Friction Dashboard Mount,This is one MUST HAVE accessory for the Garmin Nuvi. Put it right on the edge of the dashboard & drive away like a crazy person & IT STAYS WHERE YOU PUT IT! Park & its a snap to hide it somewhere so it won't get stolen. I am really happy that I purchased this accessory for my Garmin Nuvi. I think it works great!
1,goes bad after a year,"Just like other 1-star reviewers noted, mine went bad after a year of use. The base gets slippery and the unit does not stay in place. I don't use it anymore for the fear of damaging the GPS. That said, I am also thinking of buying this mount again with the hopes that it will last longer (like how many of the 5-star reviewers noted). I don't think there is another mount that's as good as this (as long as it lasts) for the price."
2,Really great but the Bracketron Nav-Mat is better!!,"Bracketron UFM-100BL Nav-Mat GPS Friction Dash PadThe Garmin Friction Dashboard Mount is a wonderful way to mount your Garmin, I don't have any complaints about it. But it's so specific for a certain product. The Bracketron Nav-Mat is so much better as it can be used with just about any suction to windshield mounted device and costs 1/3 of the Garmin Dashboard Mount. They both hold amazingly well to the dashboard, are both easily moved to suit different drivers or to hide the GPS."
5,sturdy,"Because the window mount is so reliable and easy to use, I haven't needed to use this mount yet. Am looking forward to longer trips to use it."
5,Dashboard Darling: Garmin Portable Friction Mount from Amazon,"I have had previous experience, all of it bad, with attaching a Garmin GPS so I could see it and still be within the law, and so a suction cup would not lose its suction (they always did), but success was always denied me until I acquired the Garmin Portable Friction Mount from Amazon. I can put it anywhere on the dashboard and it stays there within view, and lawful. What a relief and what a perfect mount for my Garmin GPS. Thank you, Amazon.Rev. Richard J, Norsworthy"
5,"A ""must-have"" item","This portable mount is a really neat addition to the GPS. It eliminates the need to use the windshield suction cup, and makes using the GPS a lot easier, since you can place it anywhere on your dashboard or console that is the most convenient for you. Highly recommended."
5,this really works,"I've seen similar products, but this one is the best. Stays put, holds the gps firmly, prevents it from flying off the windshield onto the floorboards."
4,Very nice Product,"It is a very nice product and is very helpful while driving. No hassels like the once with the conventional holders. But is good for a year or two after which it starts moving on the dash. That may be due to the continuous exposure of the product to the sun heat when it is parked in the parking lot e.t.cIf I get a new one, I would still prefer to buy this product."
5,A necessary accessory,"It is a little bulky and heavy, but it needs to be to do the great job of holding your GPS exactly where you want it. It's easy to attach your GPS and position it. It stays where you put it. I'm so glad I spend the extra money for this. It is so worth it. It was $28 on Garmin and $22 here, when purchased with the GPS. I would have liked it to be half the price, but would still buy it again, at whatever price."
5,Good idea,"Bought this for our first GPS. For not knowing what we were doing, we made a good choice. Easily assembled & disassembled. Never moved on dashboard, even with sharp braking & very rough dirt roads. Also leaves no sign for potential thieves."
1,garmin portable friction mount,"The garmin portable friction mount will not hold my garmin on the ball mount, ball seams to be smaller then the one that came with my garmin."
2,Awesome at first - Then it slides all over the place.,I bought this product because of the awesome reviews. It worked great for the first few months. But after months of picking up a little dust from the dash the friction mount no longer holds. When I accelerate or go around a sharp turn the GPS and friction mount go flying. I don't recommend this product.
4,good,"works as intended though it is a little light and has fallen off dashboard once, but I would buy again."
4,Quality of Garmin Portable,Quality of Garmin Portable is good. It is beautifull. It is not too heavy. It does not move when I put it on the dashboard of car. It is great.
5,Creative design,I had wind shield mounting for my Garmin GPS. I often had GPS falling off from my windshield mounting due to poor design. After buying friction mounting i never had any issue.
3,Worked Great At First,"I loved this at first. After a few months that ended. I live in Nor Cal and in the mountains, at a quick stop or turn, I have to hold on to it. Anybody find a way to get it to hold again like when it was new??"
4,Works Well,"The Good: It sits on your dashboard without moving, but can be easily moved or adjusted if you care to. In other words, it does well what it is supposed to.The Bad: It is difficult to attach and, especially, unattach the 750 from this unit. Not that it can't be done, but it requires a bit of an awkward grip. You get better with practice. It is rather expensive."
4,Good item for your GPS,I am happy with my purchase of this item.It helps to make your GPS easily visible and readable. You too will be pleased with this item.
5,Great Portable Mount for Garmin GPS,"Faced with a motor trip to California, I knew that the standard windshield mount would not work. I researched the web and found what was generally called a ""beanbag mount"" for the Garmin GPS. It had several key advantages. 1. It could be mounted near the front edge of the dash, affording me easy control and visibility of the unit as well as the road ahead. 2. It was easily moved to the floor for quick stops for meals, etc. 3. It was easily removed from the vehicle for extended stops, overnight, etc. 3. It was easily portable to other vehicles, especially rentals. It was everything I needed."
2,not a complete set,disappointed that it didn't come with the holder for the garmin..so it's not a complete set just the mount and base..i give it 2 stars because the base is a lot better then my original ..must seek the part i need elsewhere
5,Never budged,"I couldn't be more pleased with it. I just completed a 2,500 mile round trip with it on the dash of my Tahoe. It held my Garmin 1450 rock solid on my dash the whole time. It never budged even during a couple of hard-braking incidents and severe swerves which one will encounter during that much freeway time. I have since used it in my LeSabre with the same result. It is quick and easy to remove from the dash and place in the console at any and all stops. I love it and would recommend it to all. At this price it would make a great ""inexpensive"" gift for friend or family."
5,Very satisfied,"I purchased the Garmin friction mount for my Garmin 680, and found it to work superbly. I prefer it to the windshield mount, as it is easier to transfer between vehicles and much easier to reach when entering destinations or changing settings. The only improvement would be to supply the cradle instead of robbing the one from the windshield mount, but I understand different units require different cradles."
5,Works great!,This product is a great idea - especially if you have concerns about theft - which is common when thieves see the window mount. You can easily put this whole unit under the seat out of sight and then just put it back out. It holds solid to the dash - I have not seen it move AT ALL even on hard turns and quick stops. The quick release button also makes it easy to remove the Nuvi.
4,Good Product,This product is a good product but I only gave it a 4 because it does tend to slide around a bit which tells me it needs to be a little heavier or used a tackier material for a base. Other then that it is super easy to use and set up and I would recommend this product to buy.
4,Glad I Switched from Suction Mount,"After going through two suction mounts for my Garmin, I switched to this friction mount and am glad I did. It stays relatively in place, slipping no more than a couple inches, even when I have to hit the brakes suddenly. When running into a store, it is so much easier to lift off the dash and place on the floor/center console. Plus, it doesn't leave those suction marks on the windshield and I don't have to worry about it falling off in the heat or the cold."
5,Smooth Sailing,"I have the window mount for my Garmin, but this is so much more steady on those not so smooth roads. Works excellent on all my cars and is so easy to move from one to the other."
4,Great Product,This is such a great product for anyone who doesn't want the GPS in plain view all the time. It is very sturdy and doesn't slip off the dashboard. I would highly recommend it.
4,Much better than the original.,"The window mount suction cup that comes with the Garmin GPS unit is not really practical. After touching the screen a few times the mount loses its grip and the unit falls, usually while you're driving. The friction mount isn't perfect, but a much better option. You need to make sure your dash has a relatively flat section large enough for it to sit on.Nothing compares to having the GPS unit built into the dash, but this is much better than what Garmin provides as original equipment. Why don't they just make it an option when you buy the GPS in the first place, so you don't wind up with a suction mount that you'll never use after getting the friction version?"
5,Great Design,Very well designed with good quality. The Garmin Suction Cup Mount kept dropping and I replaced it with new one (suction cup) and it kept happening again until I replaced it with this new design. Excellent product. Now I dont need to worry about it while I am driving and can keep it anywhere I want.
4,I wonder why...,"...this is not included with the car mount. I used the adhesive disc that came with my car mount until I got tired of the sticky mess it left on the dashboard, and really like this mount. It gives a good view of the GPSr and is easy to position when you need to."
4,good stuff to buy,"It goes well with my white sedan(interior is grey-colored).Easy to put on the dashboard, and holding on it well, this item does its purpose perfectly.The design has more to be desired.Why dose the Garmin Company develop more simple and advanced design?The four sided bean bags seem to ruin the simplicity and perfect usage.Except the design problem, everything is O.K. with me, and I would recommend it to my friends."
4,Good,"It's a good GPS. Just a little expensive. It has text to speak, which is very good. However, it's still a little expensive than I think."
3,Hard to snap on,I like everything about this product except one thing...it is hard to snap onto the holder. That is OK when the unit is not active but when it is active I found the pressure from the back to snap this in caused my Garmin to default to a frozen position. Really annoying when I'm in a hurry to start it up and find something local.
5,Easy way to use the new GPS system,"The Garmin friction mount works nicely, it sets comfortably on a slanted dash surface without slipping. It's a good solution and enables me to have the gps at my fingertips."
3,Garmin Friction Mount,"nothing special, a bit bulky, but it works as a good stand. It fits easily in a good size globe compartment."
5,BEST HOLDER FOR GPS!!!,"This is a great product!!! Not only don't you have to worry about the marks the other holders leave on the window, but you can place this anywhere on the dashboard. It can easily be removed and placed under the seat and out of sight!! Great!!!"
5,Best mount for a Garmin,I don't like to attach anything to my windshield. This mount sits on the dash and actually does the job better because it's more adjustable as to direction and distance and sits out closer. It stays where it's put and it's very easy to conceal the whole unit when you need to.
5,Best Mount!,"Very good mount, doesn't move around and is just an all-around a good product. It's the 1st thing you should buy after you get your GPS."
5,Works great!,I was skeptical but never moved during hard driving. Creates a much better viewing postion for the GPS than the suction mounts.
4,Works as advertised,The product works as advertised and stays where you put it even on a relativley bumpy road.
5,A must have for the GPS.,"I have a Prius and this this will be a plus for my Garmin. When traveling it will be easy to move the unit to the floor when out of the car, preventing theft."
5,Get the most from your Garmin,"This item completely solves the positioning of your Garmin. It's easy to set up, and doesn't require a flat surface to attach. It removes in a hurry and can be stored either in the trunk or under the seat, in such a way that passers-by won't see it. Well worth the price."
4,works well but bulky,"Like the flexibility and it certainly stays in place. Would like it to be smaller, easier to stash away."
5,Excellent Solution,"I, too, had the problem with the Garmin Nuvi 350 falling off the windshield. After reading the reviews for this portable mount, I decided to buy it. It's a bit bulky but gets the job done. No more falling off the windshield and it's easier to position the viewing angle. Too bad Garmin doesn't include it with the original accessories. I would have paid more to have this included."
4,Great accessory,"This is a great accessory for a GPS unit. It is easy to adjust, stays in place well, and best of all can be taken off the dash and put on the floor of the car when not in use without disconnecting the power cord. Then easily replaced on the dash when desired. This latter ability is very helpful because it gets the unit out of sight of anyone looking to steal it.The only thing I would have liked to have come with it is a ""visor"" that shields the screen from sunlight while sitting on the dash. However, one is easly made from black paper and Scotch tape and it slips easily between the support and the back of the GPS unit.A good purchse--I recommend it."
4,sandbag mount,"Big and bulky... says ""I've got a GPS"" but functionality is superb. Solid and stable.Could have had GPS holder included rather than relying on windshield mount's holder."
5,Garmin Friction Mount,I purchased this Garmin Friction Mount to sit on my dash. The suction mount always left a spot on my windshield. I really like this type mount. It stays where I put it and doesn't slide. I am very pleased with this purchase.
5,For People who live in California --- a must,"I just purchased a Garmin nuvi 660 4.3-inch Widescreen bluetooth Portable GPS Navigator, and found out through the California DMV that window mounted Navigators are quite illegal now. The Solution is Garmin Portable Friction Dashboard Mount. It is perfect. It doesn't budge once you set it were you want it and with a quick release you take you navigator with you or stow it away. Then you set the friction pad on the floor and no one knows you even have a navigator in your car.It Works for me. !!!!!"
4,Great product for switching garmin between cars,"Not only is it good for switching between cars, its also good if you don't want to use a windshield mount. In our area, there is a lot of GPS theft, so we opted for this mount for ease of putting up and taking down. Under normal driving conditions it will never slide off the dash...however, if you accelerate fast from a stop it may fly off the dash, which has happened at least a few times for me. Only solution would be to make it even heavier for us 'spirited' drivers, but if you are planning for such driving, I would opt for the windshield mount....sports car drivers, etc."
4,Great item: used in Rental and Zipcars,"UPDATE (08/2010): I have still used the same friction mount that I purchased last year. It's still great, one minor complaint is that it doesn't always fit in the glove box/center arm rest storage areas, depending on the car. Since my last post, I've also used this with a Nissan Sentra, VW Bug, Ford Focus, Toyota Highlander, Chevy Impala. No problems with those cars at all. I'm back now to purchase a few more of these for gifts: once someone sees mine, they covet one for themselves!I don't have my own car, but often rent and use Zipcar within my city. This mount has worked in all cars thus far (Scions Xa-d), Toyota Camry, Mazdas, Honda Accord, etc). I do worry that it may not work in all cars.It is a bit big, but don't mind that because I think the sturdy footprint helps with stability and I have been able to fit it in the glovebox of the cars I've used."
5,Great solution for that ugly black ring left on windshield plus FREE THEFT PROTECTION!!,"I bought this friction mount immediately when I got my Nuvi. It makes the Nuvi completely portable from car to car but the best feature is that you can easily put the whole thing down and under the seat when you leave your car for long or short periods. One of the biggest problems with GPS units is their popularity with thieves. Even if you take the suction mount off when you leave your car, the telltale black ring is still there providing an invitation to ""come look in my glove box"". It also pays to shop around. These things are selling for more than TWICE the price on some websites and at stores. Give yourself some peace of mind and convenience all in one smart package. BUY IT!! YOU WON'T REGRET!"
3,Pretty good quality. Very convenient,"This product is as advertised. It holds nicely to the dashboard without sliding. The only downside, and maybe it's my GPS is that the ball to which you attach the GPS is a bit loose and the GPS tends to sag down with vehicle motion.Overall, this was a good value purchase."
5,Works great!,"We quickly tired of having the suction cup mount included with our Garmin Nuvi 360 fall to the dash and looked for alternatives. Saw this one at Best Buy but it seemed overpriced at $40. Checked Amazon, read the positive reviews, and saved over $10. I just purchased two more to give as gifts!"
5,must have,"The GPS unit comes with a suction cup mount, but if you're going to move it between cars, the friction mount is MUCH easier to grab and go. Also the wires go directly into it, so if you want to snap off the unit to go walking around, it's much easier."
5,Garmin should make this standard for the Nuvi...,"I've gone through two suction cup mounts for the Nuvi 350, and as others have endured, left with a black ring and an occasional surprise lap full of GPS. I knew there had to be a better way as I saw the beanbag holder for the aviation versions of Garmin when I fly. Lo and behold, this small friction mount is the ticket. It's simple, doesn't budge, and I tuck it behind my passenger seat when not in use. The mount disconnects and fits in my console easily. I love it, and have been extremely satisfied with the ease of use, adjustability, and simplicity."
5,My Garmin Mount,One of the neatest gadgets ever made.I have a sloping dashboard and this is just awesome.Stays in place very handy item works great.
2,Great idea-doesn't work in my truck,"I thought this holder was a great idea instead of having to mount the navigator to the window. Unfortunately, it does not work in my truck, at least. It works on the counter at home-and on the seat next to me somewhat-but not on my dash. I had two friends also try to position it so it would hold and I could see the navigator. No luck. I'm not sure if it's because of my particular dashboard or not but I'm going to have to try to find my receipt and box and return it since I cannot use it at all. By the way, it does sit on the dash well and not slide-that's not the problem. The problem is that I cannot see the navigator screen when driving because it is positioned in too much of a slant. Again-it may be because of my dashboard."
5,Great Product!,"I would highly recommend the Garmin Portable Friction Dashboard Mount - it has worked well in my 2009 Accord as well as 2006 Odyssey. I don't have to remove the suction holder (that came with my nuvi garmin) from the windshield after each use since Garmin units gets stolen from cars when the suction holder is left back on the windshield. The Garmin Mount is stable and can be placed close the the driver without having any permanant alterations to your car, but can be hidden away after each use. I have a small plastic box where I store the garmin unit + mount after each use. I brought this product from amazon after reading reviews from other customers. They were right it giving it a 5/5 score!"
5,Genius Accessory for Garmin,"We saw this in a taxi cab and ""had"" to have it. It is so much better than the windshield suction aparatus. It doesn't move and it's easier to manipulate...100% fabulous."
5,Garmin Portable Dashboard Mount,"This mount really works great, it stays put and doe's not slide around while driving."
4,Great option,"If you don't want to have your GPS on the windshield this is a great option. In my vehicle, the unit would sit far from me due to a large dash.This option gives you the freedom to move the unit closer for easier viewing. It also allows for easy hiding of the unit when parked in higher crime areas.Adjustable and very stable too..."
5,Works great so far,"The product was delivered on time in perfect condition.I love this friction mount for my GPS unit. It's so easy to move it from one car to another, or to hide it when I park the car. One of my cars has a sloped dash in the middle and this grabs on great and doesn't slip. I'm glad I got this."
5,Excellent Product!,"The product does the trick and works very well with my Garmin nuvi.Good by clips, suction cups, and adhesives!"
5,Great Product!,"I've used the regular suction cup attachment for my GPS for the last year and it was constantly falling down, often while I was driving. I've had no problems since getting this, it's so much better!"
5,Nuvi Friction Mount,Now this is clever! Very stable when in place. Easy to remove and place on floor of vehicle when parked to deter theft. Worth every penny!
5,Works perfectly,"This works perfectly to support my Garmin 850Garmin nüvi 850 4.3-Inch Widescreen Portable GPS Navigator with Voice Command and FM Transmitter (Soft Black). Keeps it steady, but allows some movemet to adjust the unit for optimum viewing. It has only moved once when I had to slam on my brakes (you know that situation when the guy in front of you @#&*^#!(^!#), and then it slid slowly across my huge Saturn VUE dashboard, with no harm to the GPS or delicate charger connection.When I leave the car I put the GPS somewhere safe and just put this in the passenger floor area, or behind my seat (unplugged). Easy to use, perfectly satisfactory product. Wish there were more things in life like this!"
2,Garmin Friction Mount & Ball Arm Base,"This product will not fit Garmin Navigators with the larger suction base and did not come with the ball mount as illustrated.Garmin Portable Friction Dashboard Mount for nüvi Series and StreetPilot C5XX Series GPS Navigators (C530, C550, and C580)"
5,Exactly as expected.,Love my new Garmin. And this bracket works exactly as described. It does hold the unit even if the unit has a hard time pronouncing the streets in LA.
5,Happy Camper,"We love this, my husband didn't think he wanted it, so I gave it as a Christmas present. Needless to say he saw the beauty of it. Thanks!!"
5,Great Garmin holder,this product is just as most of the other reviews state as the holder is super stable and much more compact than the others. This is a great buy.
5,Nuvi friction mount,"I had a Nuvi 350 with the windshield suction cup mount and it was always leaving a mark on the windshield when removed, and it was a long reach from the seats, especially when wearing seatbelts. This is an excellent alternative, it sits on the dash, can me moved to any location on the dash and is easy to reach. It is very stable, never slides when turning or braking, and has better viewing options than the window mount. When I park the car I just remove the Nuvi and put the mount under the seat, out of sight. I love it, although the price seems a bit high for a moulded plastic item with a beanbag base. But, it is a quality item that will last, so I guess it's worth the price."
5,LOVE IT! Used with Nuvi 350,"This mount works beautifully - it's absolutely stable on the dashboard yet easy to move around if I have a passenger who wants to play with it. And it's super easy to stash whenever I park. Highly recommended.I'd tried the supplied dashboard mount first, and really regretted it. It was a hassle to snap the Nuvi on and off the dashboard mount, or to snap the dashboard mount off its permanent adhesive disk (now permanently stuck on my dashboard - yuck!) and I had major trouble getting the Nuvi angled the way I wanted it once it was on the dashboard mount. And as others have said, leaving the mount on the dash invites theft. With the friction mount, I just move the whole thing off the dash and drop it into a bookbag on the floor. The bookbag matches the carpet, so is virtually unnoticeable even if someone is looking in the window."
4,Nuvi friction mount,"Great product, works fantastic. Heavy weight and a soft almost sticky base made it difficult if not impossible to get this thing to budge when I pushed through turns ( I wanted to test it before trusting the expensive GPS to it). Leaves no residue, no sign that there was/is a GPS in the vehicle. We usually take the GPS and stash the mount out of sight.Works well, OK value."
5,Works like it's supposed to.,"No matter how rough i drive, it stays where it's put.It makes it easy for my passenger to input locations while I drive and easy for me to remove from the dash to hide.The only complaint is that it is kinda big."
5,Nice GPS mounting option,Mount works well on the dash without appling any attachments to the vehicle. Works well in all of my vehicles.
4,It does work,"I was skeptical, but it does work. Yes, it shifts slightly over time, but it doesn't slide around or go flying off the dashboard, no matter how sprightly I drive. And the ability to quickly hide the entire unit under the front seat is worth far more than the price of the product in security. Fifth star is held back because the thing isn't exactly beautiful. But it does do the job it sets out to do extremely well."
3,I think I was wrong to choose this product,This is an useful product but it is very uncomfortable to carry in hand luggage. I had problems at immigration office in Peru for its strange shape and its internal composition.
5,Garmin Portable Friction Mount,"This dashboard friction mount for a Garmin is exactly what we wanted and needed. It is used every day, and we have been very happy with the purchase. THANKS"
4,friction dash,I got this because I heard of the high theft rate if you have a visible mount. I don't use my Garmin except on trips so it is pretty easy to just pull this out and put it on the dash. It seems to stay put without any problem. Very portable.
5,Garmin Dashboard Mount Stays Put -,"I had some reservations about whether or not the Garmin Dashboard Mount would stay secure on the dash but it certainly does. It's the right size, easy to use and stays in place with no problem. When I arrive, the GPS goes in my purse and the Mount conveniently goes in the glove box.I'm very happy with both my Garmin purchases ......."
2,Don't buy this if your dash is at ALL sloped,"I bought this for my 2000 Blazer and it is nearly useless. I had it perched on the flattest area where access was reasonable (above the radio) and it slides forward towards the windshield. Where it slides to leaves the unit farther away than when I use the suction mount on the windshield. I may get some double stick tape to see if that helps hold it in place, but if the unit is not close enough to reach, why use this bean bag?I tried taking one of the tabs and extending it over the leading edge of the dash, but the bag non slide surface is so stiff that the tab does not bend enough to help. I have considered taking some of the ""sand"" out of one of the tabs to see if I can get it to fold over and then tape it in place, but that negates any security benefits of being able to completely remove the unit. I might just as well secure on of the little pucks that come with a unit."
3,"Just okay, stays where you put it mostly",Friction mount works best on dashes with few contours. My Acura TSX has several curves meeting between center console and instrument cluster that make positioning this unit problematic. It will also move if you like fast transitions or quick starts. I ended up fixing unit with little sticky goo balls purchased at the hardware store. You merely peel a few off and attach to bottom of mount and problem solved. I really disliked have suction cup rings on my windshield and this mount fixes that problem but as designed it could be better.
4,Friction Mount,I like the way it holds the GPS but it slides all over my dash. I will try something to help hold it in place.
4,Works on the dashboard of our Subrau Outback,"Title says it all.Works, no wires hanging down from a suction cup mount we previously had.Delivered as promised"
4,Great,I have used this friction mount for several weeks...It works very well and is much quicker to get on/off the dash compared to the suction mount. I have not encountered any negatives yet.
4,Very Nice,"Excellent product, it's small, weighted like a sand bag, doesn't slide around and does the trick. When you leave your car, just remove the bag off the dash with the Garmin still attached. Too easy to move from car to car. We had previously purchased another Garmin (also from Amazon) for our daughter and she uses the window suction cup. This is a terrible inconvenience to remove, plus smears the windshield. We are going to purchase another one of these mounts for her car. Don't think any longer, PURCHASE IT!"
4,Good and useful stuff,It is very stable and way much easier to use. The only thing I don't like is the size is a little bit to large.
2,Didn't work well for me,"Don't know if it was my dash angle or the material it's made of, but this thing would slide a bit. It's a bit bulky as well. I found that I could mount my GPS to a cup holder and it worked fine from there."
5,weighted gps holder,"This weighted mount works perfectly, especially if you use your gps in different vehicles, rentals,etc. like I do. It folds up nicely for your gps bag, and attaches to a variety of garmin units including the nuvi760. We use a couple of these in our cars and they work great, at least for most dashboards. Definitely recommend one!"
5,Wonderful purchase,"I wasn't sure whether or not to buy this since the 360 came with a suction mount for the window. I've got an older minivan and leaving suction marks and a mount in the center of my windshield wasn't my idea of good advertisement for thieves. I purchased this friction mount and it's the nuts! I don't even sit it in the center of the dash but on the left far side and it's out of my way to drive and yet I can see it perfectly. When I'm going out of the car, I just unmount the Nuvi and take it with me, and the friction mount goes in one of many other non-viewable areas in my front seat. Slick, great idea, doesn't slide, adapts to all dashes and I'm glad I bought it. A little tricky to figure out how to attach only because I was afraid to push too hard; it uses a hard push to get the ball end into the socket and from then on it's a breeze."
5,Works Great,"Grips my dash really well. It is a great alternative when you don't want to ""stick"" the suction cup to the windshield."
5,"Best mounting option, even for 'spirited' drivers","I purchased this with my Garmin Nuvi GPS as I didn't want to use a suction cup mount on my windshield. Even if you don't leave the suction cup mount permanently attached, they still leave a mark on the windshield, alerting potential thief's that a GPS unit is in the car.I was slightly concerned that the 'friction' of this mount might not be enough to handle my somewhat spirited driving. However, in over a year of using this (not full time) it has never moved once.It's so easy to pull this off your dashboard and stash it before pulling into a parking lot. It even stores in my glove compartment with no issues.Highly recommended!"
5,Total Satisfaction!,"The original suction-it-onto-the window idea, it may make your dash look neat and less cluttered, but the Garmin crashing to the floor when the suction gives out is distracting at the very least and downright dangerous when you're maneuvering a vehicle in traffic. I previously purchased a similar sandbag style dash mount that had a smooth surface where you were supposed to afix the original Garmin windshield suction mount. I thought that the reason it fell off the windshield was due to the weight of the GPS device hanging downward, but it also fell off when the weight was pushing downward. This mount replaces the flawed suction device with a slide-in-and-lock system that is totally reliable. No more groping around the floor, trying to grab the GPS as I'm driving."
5,garmin mount,"Excellent for my husband. His front seat is usually full of ""items"" so the mount on the dash makes it easy for him for use the nuvi quickly."
5,works advertised,only used it for a month so far but delivers as expected - makes it easy to use the nuvi 760 and transfer from car to truck to rental car. Mount never moves a bit. highly recommended.
3,Not worth it,"Bought this, however ended up suction-cupping it to my windsheild because it wobbles on this stand and if i have to slam on the breaks or turn quickly, it slides all over my dash...not a bad unit, just doesn't work for what i need it to do"
5,great product,"When my Garmin GPS kept losing suction and falling off thewindshield repeatedly, I purchased this to safeguard the GPS.Works great. Stays put on the dashboard with just a square of rubber shelf linerunder it. Just what I was looking for at a nice price."
4,Holds GPS unit securely on dashboard.,This mount holds my Garmin GPS unit securely on the dashboard. The GPS can be positioned anywhere on the dashboard and the vertical angle can be adjusted as desired for easy viewing.
4,Helpful,"We like this product and it works great most of the time. This is our second one for our second GPS and we've found they don't always stay put when driving and slide off the dash from time to time, crashing to the floor. Hard on the GPS. We have learned to grab it if we are cornering, which isn't always the safest thing to do. Overall, a handy gadget and makes seeing the GPS much easier."
5,Excellent,Found this mount to be exactly what I want. I just set it on my dash. It doesn't move. Then I can pick it up and sit it on the floor or whereever I want when not in use.
2,durability issues,"everybody seems to love this mount, and it does indeed work pretty well, but I found that the neoprene bottom is very fragile and prone to developing holes and ripping. my first mount ripped within a week, sent it back to Amazon and the replacement started developing a hole almost immediately. i wasn't impressed."
4,Too Soon,I did do a preliminary set up - trying twoavailable positions. Impressively flexible. I have high hopes for this product.
5,Great deal for the money,Easily clips onto the Garmin. The 4 sides of the base are flexible enough to conform to the various angles of the
5,Works great,"I have a Nissan Rouge and this fits perfectly on the dashboard!It doesn't slide around, it just sits firmly on where you put it.With this product you don't have to use any sort of permanent mount for your GPS.Great product! I recommend this."
5,Best thing ever!,"Love having a GPS but the window one always falls. This one doesn't fall or move. Stays in place and holds the unit perfectly. Even bought one as a gift, they loved it to."
5,good holder,so far it has done its job i like it and glad i got it .. it is not in my way and stays in place and i drive kinda quick.. buy it worth it..
2,Don't bother - just use the suction cup,Unless you need to get the GPS really close to you on the dash the suction cup mount provided in the package is smaller and more convenient. I wouldn't bother with this.
1,Disappointed,"The picture of the product was correct, but that's not the product I recieved. I think it was a bait and switch program."
1,Do NOT Buy this!,"It does everything it says it does EXCEPT hold the Garmin GPS. It is totally useless. The space at the bottom available for the GPS is too narrow, and the arm that the GPS is supposed to rest on is too far forward and causes the GPS to fall forward. The ONLY way the GPS will lean against this arm is if it is facing sideways with the GPS resting on the side of the arm. However, this doesn't help at all as the GPS won't fit in the space below, so it is held in place by nothing. This item is totally unusable!"
1,Friction Mount,It didn't come with directions & the suction cup display seemed to make more sense so I returned this item.
2,limited,The only thing I could say about this product is just be sure your gps device fits this particular product. It only supports a particular type.
3,"Prodcut is good, seller is bad","I ordered this one as new, but the package that I received was opened and resealed. I was totally disappointed to pay for new one and receive a used one. I needed to use it very next day and couldn't return to the store.No complaints on the product though, it works just as other stated and I love it."
1,Can't understand all the other good reviews,"This item is nicely made, and the arm rotates nicely, and doesn't jiggle with the Garmin attached.It seemed to work OK at first, then I noticed it, more and more, sliding all over the place, frequently sliding off the dash and onto the floor. I don't Armor-All the dashboards and keep them pretty free of dust, so I don't know what the deal is. Maybe, it just took a week or two of ""normal"" exposure to heat/sun and getting some minimal dust in the soft foam underpad to kill it. Maybe I just started to drive more normal rather than so slowly while paying attention to the GPS. In the end, I wound up going back to the windshield mount because it just never comes off. To me, the whole thing sliding onto the floor is a major safety hazard I was not willing to accept."
2,"Causes Cancer, Birth Defects, or Reproductive Harm","Just to give you guys a heads up, there is a PROP 65 warning label on this product. That means this product is known to the state of California to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm.I cannot believe Garmin put poisonous chemicals in something as simple as a GPS mount! I feel duped. There should be a warning on the product description on Amazon."
5,GPS Friction holder,"This adapts perfectly to the Garmin I purchase. It stays on the dash of both our cars without leaving that ""telltalre suction cup mark"". Also easier for a passenger to grab and reprogram as needed."
1,"Not enough ""Friction""","when hitting bumps in a uneven road, everything moves. Is there something I'm doing wrong? There are no directions with this mount."
1,not for 700 series,This product is advertised for the entire Nuvi line of Garmin products. It does not work for the 700 series. The 700 series requires a connection in the base of the mounting bracket to plug in the USB connector.This doesn't have one.
5,A Good Gizmo,It works. Easy to adjust... doesn't slip. Unplug and carry between my motorhome and Honda.John M
4,This is a wonderful invention,"This simple device is simply the ""cat's meow."" It fits easily on the dashboard, stays in place and makes the GPS truly portable. The best part is that there are no more little circle on your windshield glass that let's thieves know that there may be a GPS in your car (even if you have taken it in the house with you) which will save you a broken window. I would highly recommend this mount.Michael Patterson"
2,Big and Clumsy,"I bought this mounting device for my gps but have found it big and clumsy and when I went to use it on my dashboard , it is too big. It wont fit within the configurations of the car. [...] I am not always technically suave and this came with no directions.so I ask my son to figure it out. I don't recommend it."
3,Watch those U-turns,"Otherwise an excellent solution for a driver who uses more than one vehicle, I killed my Garmin Nuvi while pulling a hurried U-turn. The Garmin shot across the dashboard and struck the passenger-side door. It now will only boot-up only to shut right back down. If you have a choice, use the suction cup. If not, watch those U-turns."
5,No more marks on your windshield,"This thing is so much better than the thing that attach to the glass. No more marks on your windshield. Holds the GPS stable on the dash even with violent curves, it is not exacly small but usually fits in the glove compartment and you may have to detach the GPS from it (which is a very fast and easy operation).This product sold from amazon for fifteen dollars is the same garmim OEM that you can get in eletronic stores, but there will costy forty dollar."
5,Works Great!,I ordered this friction mount because I wanted to be able to take our new GPS in and out of our vehicles easily. It is so convenient and works great!
5,Holds without sliding in my CRV,"I've owned this mount for about 8 months now and it has performed great. I use it in my Honda CRV and my wife uses it in her Dodge Caravan. It has always held firm in both vehicles, even when I've made some abrupt manuvers. The things I like are that I can keep the GPS attached to the mount and easily transfer it between vehicles, I can take the GPS off of the dashboard and sit it on the vehicle's floor if I am in an area where theft is a concern, and that it has always held the GPS without sliding. I am very happy with my purchase."
5,Love it!,Just bought the dashboard mount for the Nuvi. I had one for my old C330 and liked it. The nuvi one is awesome. Sits perfectly on my dash in a little indent (Honda Civic). Does not move around. Alot less hassle than the windshield mount. You can store it in your console and noone see's the telltale signs of a Garmin in your car. Great Amazon price and fast shipping.
5,Perfect,"I have a 2008 eclipse. A very small car, very small dash board. I first started with it mounted to the windshield (it's illegal in California? Oops!) but that was hard because I wanted to take the whole unit off every time i parked publicly. Finally I attached the permanent dashboard disk thing to my dashboard, but still wanted to take the suction cup mount down whenever i parked somewhere. The suction cup lost it's suction power in three weeks, and my whole unit would randomly fall. And any professional thief would see the permanent dashboard disk attachment anyways. So I bought this contraption. Looks odd but it works so well. i was worried it wouldn't fit anywhere on my dashboard, but I found a little crevice to rest it in and it works great. No sliding. Good solution."
4,Great alternative compared to the windsheild mount !!!!!,"I recently purchased the Garmin nuvi 660 on Cyber Monday 07'and also purchased the Garmin portable friction mount. I enjoy the portable friction mount a lot. I travel a lot with my job via car and do not always have time to ""mapquest"" directions for my next stop. The portable friction mount is very convient to place on your dash board and when finished pack it away in your bag or just leave on your dash. Would highly recommend the portable friction mount as an alternative to having the windsheild mount, if your rear view mirror wasn't enough hanging from your windsheild. I based my decision to purchase the portable friction mount on other Amazon customers reviews on this same item. I hope someone finds this review to be honest and helpful in making a decision."
4,Love it.,"Works perfect, never slides on the dash. However, it is pretty big sitting up there. A worthwhile purchase. Great replacement for the worthless Garmin suction mount."
5,easy to use,Delivery was on time and the product was easy to use on my dash board of my car. I'm in real estate and this is quite helpful. When you are done with it don't leave it in the car for everyone to see take it with you when you are done.
5,highly recommended over suction mount,"I have been using this friction mount with my nüvi for over two years and continue to be very pleased with it.For the first few months I had the nüvi, I used the included suction mount to mount it on the windshield, dutifully removing it as recommended when parking away from home, especially at the office where there had been a rash of car break-ins just for GPS theft. The suction mount was always a challenge to remove from the windshield-- it felt as if it were liable to break apart, and eventually it did...On a friend's recommendation I bought this friction mount to replace it. I was skeptical that it would stay in place during sharp turns, braking, etc., but in fact it never budges in the slightest. And it is easy to both set up and to hide away. (Well, it is too bulky to hide in the glove compartment or completely under the seat, but it can be kept well enough out of view beneath the front of the seat.)"
5,Good product and good price.,"I have wanted a ""non window"" GPS mount. I was unwilling to pay the prices asked of most products I reviewed. This product hit the mark! Excellent price and has all of the functions I need. No more ""unsticking it from the windshield"" when I want to get my GPS out of site. By the way thieves look for the tale-tale signs of the windshield ""circles"" left by your removal to determine if car is worth breaking into."
5,It's a Godsend!,Purchased this dashboard mount for my Nuvi 360 and could not be happier. I am able to securely mount the GPS on my dashboard without having to fiddle with the windshield attachment. The mount is adequately weighted so no shifting has been noted even driving on roads that are in disrepair. This also allows easier transfer of my GPS to another vehicle or to securely stow the unit in my trunk for safe keeping. No regrets on this purchase.
5,Perfect for my car!,"Bought this at a recommendation of a friend and could not be happier! Not only can I move it anywhere I want it on my dash board, but I can get rid of it easily when I park in an area I do not want it displayed. Stays put without any worries. Highly recommend!"
4,Works great,"The suction cup mount is worthless, while this product is great! Never slides across your dash, even in sharp, fast turns"
5,Love it!,Gramin snaps right in. Keeps it a the perfect height for viewing and stays put. It does not slide around. When not in use I place it right under the passenger seat with no problems (taking my garmin off of course).
5,Great Mount,"This is a fantastic mount. It gives the best of both worlds a mount that doesn't move and holds the GPS device perfectly in place. It also gives you the mobility to move it between vehicles without having to do deal with the windshield mount.I've used this in a silverado, g35 and accord and it works the same in all vehichles."
2,does not stay put,"I purchased this product in hopes that it would eliminate the ""suction cup"". This product looked as if it should do the job of staying put. However since I drive a semi the vibration of the truck made it necessary to attach the mount with velcro in order to keep it in place. Good idea but not for the truck."
3,Slides easier as it ages,"I've had this item for 3 months, and initially was very impressed with it's holding power on the dash. It's not magic - it will come off if you make a sudden turn or floor it from a stop light - but generally it stayed put, even through some *very* curvy roads in West Virginia at a ""spirited"" pace.Over time, however, it seems to have absorbed the oils or possiblly Armor-All out of the dash (leaving a distinct dry spot on the dash in the shape of the mount), which has impacted it's performance. It still generally stays put, but takes much less aggressive a maneuver to make it move. I am currently trying different cleaners to try to reclaim some of the original grip.As mentioned many times, the ability to remove it from the car, put it on the floor, move it to different cars, etc. is very nice. I would buy it again."
5,Perfect,Tired of the GPS suction cup failing and flopping under the passenger seat? I bought this for a friend and it was so praised that I bought one for myself. I'll never use a windshield suction cup again!
3,Great at first,"I purchased my first GPS (garmin 755T) in April of this year (2009) along with this friction mount. Both worked very well for a while. The mount sit on the top of my dash on a slopped part of my dash. Until the past month I could take a turn and not worry about the mount nor the GPS hitting the floor. Not so now. I have used a cleaner/protecter on my dash at lest 3 times over the time I have had both with no problem, until now. I have used clear water on a rag to wipe the bottom of the mount with little or no effect. Now every time I turn Lt. I worry that the mount with my GPS on it will slide off, with I might add no worning. I'm at a point that I think that I will invest in something else to protect my GPS.I would only suggest this mount to someone that has a car with a flat dash, and then make sure that they understand that they should never clean/protect there dash ever again."
5,GPS Mount,I got tired of my GPS suction cup mount failing and my GPS crashing in or near my coffee on my trips so I bought this friction mount. It sits nicely on my dashboard and solved the problem. I also can now stow it easily and not leave those tell-tale rings on my windshield that advertise to thieves that I use a GPS or radar detector.
3,A bit fragile,"This worked well at first. Unfortunately the rotating part with the small clip (that clips holder onto the heavy base) broke where the spring is, so now it can only be used in a single fixed position. Ok as long as you don't mind not being able to swivel the GPS easily. Disappointing as it seems it should be sturdier, given the weight of the GPS."
5,I was not entirely optimistic,"I thought this thing would be sliding all over my dashboard but it stays put. You slide in your attachment, hook that up to the GPS, Garmin nuvi 2300LM in my case, lock it into place, and you set it on the dashboard and you are good to go. It works perfectly. I much prefer it to the suction cups or vent attachments I've tried. And the 'frustration free' packaging is also a huge bonus."
5,Works great,I use this for myGarmin nüvi 765/765T 4.3-Inch Bluetooth Portable GPS Navigator with Lifetime Traffic. I've had it for about 18 months now. I keep it with the Garmin attached in the center console of my car and then pull it out whenever I want to use it. The foam on the bottom has gotten a bit nicked up over time but otherwise it's held up really well and I've even traveled with it across the country (both driving and flying).
5,Nuvi Static Mount,"Over the years I've had several different Garmin products. For a while, I liked the suction mount, but in hot or cold conditions, the suction can give up. This mount is perfect for my Nuvi. It is a quality product!"
4,As good as it looks,"Purchased this after the suction cup on our window mount broke off.It IS going to take up a good deal of space on your dash. We have a mini-van so that is not an issue.Otherwise, it shows no tendancy to want to skid, the ball joint fits perfectly, and the arm is nicely adjustable.Very Pleased!"
4,"Nice product, a bit bulky","I wasn't all that clear on what I was receiving even though I read the reviews so I will tell others who might be similarly unsure. This is a ""bean bag"" type mount which simply plops on your dashboard and supports the GPS unit. It is a simple design, ruggedly made and quite stable throughout the range of normal driving. If you are on a four-leaf clover off ramp and you like the thrill of having your vehicle right near the edge of the tires' grip, this mount will keep the GPS unit from sliding.The only negative, as you might expect, is that it is a bit bulky and unattractive sitting on your dash. It is probably unavoidable by the very nature of the design. I take mine off the dash whenever I stop the car for this very reason. Otherwise, the mount works well and is worth the price."
5,great mount,"I use this for my nuvi 200W. It's awesome. The nuvi doesn't move while I'm driving, even when the driving gets a little crazy. I highly recommend it."
5,friction mount,Now that I have it I love it. sticks very well to dash and does not move. A word of caution do not use armor all on dash or you will have issues. it holds the gps nicely in an area that is unobstructive and easy to view. would defiantly buy again
3,Ball and Socket Weakens and Bracket Must Be Replaced,"My problem is actually not so much with the bean bag (although it DOES start slipping after a year and will end up in your lap with any acceleration after that). My REAL problem, is the BALL AND SOCKET system of attachment to the bracket (which holds the GPS). I rarely detach the bracket FROM the ball and socket (instead, I take the GPS unit out of it's bracket). However, after one year of use, the ball/socket connection is now somehow weakened to the point of the bracket detaching from the ball, with the GPS unit falling flat on it's face (still attached to the bracket). I don't know if its the repeated jiggles and imperfect road conditions, or the occasional pivoting of the GPS for a better viewing angle, but it doesn't seem like this should have happened. Unfortunately, it seems like almost all of the dash mounts use the ball and socket system. Anyone have any idea how I can avoid this problem in the future? Any help is kindly appreciated."
2,Useless after three years,"Have had this device for about three years. When new, it had a decent grip on the dashboard. Now, it slides all over the places when turning and if I have to suddenly brake, it may become a dangerous weapon to the passenger. On sharp turns, it would slide on the dashboard to the extend the GPS will come off the mount. The bottom of the holder has lost its grip over time that I am considering using velcro to provide a mean of stabilizing it when I placed on the dashboard."
5,Great way to secure and display your GPS!,"My car's dash is very curvy and the surface is not smooth so I decided the friction mount was probably the way to go. Once I was finally able to successfully attach the unit to the mount (you basically have to grit your teeth and force the cradle on to the ball of the mount); I could tell how convenient and user friendly this would be, as the unit swivels on the ball and adjusts up and down and side to side. I ended up placing it in a small space between the left to the driver's seat area of the windshield and arched part of the dash over the speedometer, etc. instrumentation. It's perfect there as I can easily glance at it (if necessary) without removing my eyes from the road for more than a split second. I'm very happy so far with this product!"
5,Garmin Portable Friction Mount,This is a great product. No sticking your GPS in the window. Just set it up on your dash and go. When not in use just put it on the floor or glove compartment. We love it! A++
5,great product,This is great! I have used the suction cups on the dash and window. They always fell off after awhile. I was afraid the gps would break. This mount doesn't move. I bought this for my wives vehicle so it really got put to the test! Great product. I wish I had bought this sooner.
4,Surpringly stable,This stand for the Garmin Nuvi is surprisingly stable considering it's weighted and not tethered. It does not slide around in the car and is without permanent attachment or suction. It was worth the price.
5,Great gadget,Great gadget. My garmin was always falling off window attachment and this little tool saved me from the many distractions of it falling on me while driving. Love it!!
4,Good value,"Does exactly what I thought - stable, no sliding on dashboard. Easy to remove/remount GPS. I recommend this product, and I would buy it again."
5,Stay put with friciton,"this is a great mount that keeps the gps in place. with the low profile, your driving view is unobstructed. this mount packs easily and of course flat in you carry-on so its readily available when you get the rental car. just pop on the gps, set your destination and go. it's really worth the money versus using the suction mount which blocks your view of traffic."
5,friction mount,Perfect for switching from one car to another. Easy to store out of sight. Price and delivery were excellent.
4,Garmin Portable Mount,Very pleased. Product found to be as advertised and so far very satisfied with performance. Amazon was freat to deal with.
5,Garmin Portable Friction Mount,This item works great in my Grand Cherokee and in my wifes Volvo 850. It stays in place and does not block frontal view in either vehicle. Easy to remove and hide from view.
4,Nice product,The Friction Dashboard Mount is a good product. The flaw I found was when you make sharp right turns or a long looping right exit ramp turn the mount will slide off the dashboard.
5,I Like It!,"I bought this because the windshield suction mount would fall off, usually at an inopportune moment. This works much better -- the GPS stays in place!"
4,Great Product,I bought this product so that I wouldn't have to leave the tell tale signs of GPS due to suction cup marks on my windshield. This is a great product and is very easy to use.
4,You get what you pay for!,Finally settled on this product after failure with other cheap holders. Works like a charm with my Garmin GPS. I plug it in and never worry about it again while driving. You get what you pay for!
3,,I ordered two Garmin friction mounts. Price was very very good. These two products were smaller than similar product available locally from Best buy. No original packaging and were not well made. Clearly these were not made by Garmin but immitation product.One was defective and exchanged for a genuine product on August 5th. Thanks Amazon.
5,Perfect,"I bought this item after my suction cup mount stopped sticking. Wouldn't you know it, the day after I ordered this, the suction cup mount gave out while I was driving & dropped my gps onto the middle console of my car. It hit hard enough to break the on/off switch. Really ticked me off! Not only was my gps broken, but I was now lost downtown. Thankfully my gps unit was replaced & I immediately put its suction cup out of sight. No way will I use that again. This friction mount is perfect. It's easy to use, easy to move whenever needed, stays put, & I'm not scared of it sending my gps unit flying."
5,"Liked it so much, bought one for my sister","Just what I needed. Easy to transport from vehicle to vehicle. Easy to place the GPS unit in it. Easy to tuck under the seat & hide. I liked mine so much, when my sister got her Garmin, I purchased one for her too."
4,Good Universal Mount,"This is a good universal GPS Mount. It works especially well on flat surfaces, but can slip on sloped dash board."
2,Too Bulky,"I bought this mount as recommended by Amazon to buy along with Garmin NUVI 1350/1350T widescreen portable GPS. I have no use of this mount because the body is so bulky and it doesn't mold onto the shape of my dash board. In fact, the Garmin GPS itself came with a small mount that we can use and it fit perfectly on our dash board. The cost of return shipping for this bulky and heavy mount is almost the same as the cost of the mount itself. If you have a small mid size car, I wouldn't recommend buying this mount. It's a waste of money."
5,Perfect item!! Thanks!!,"This the best Garmin Portable Friction Mount. Can get better than this!! I love this, it is light to carry this and very ""thick and stuck"" to hold my Garmin nuvi 1300LM.Mailing this was quickly and came to my home in about 4 days when I payed this in Amazon.Perfect!!!Thanks!!!"
5,Fantastic,I ordered this product after seeing it in my friend's car. It holds the GPS with greater stability than the suction cup device. I have made several trips with it and the device keeps the GPS right where I want it to help me navigate through the country.
5,Made GPS Easier to use,"I wanted to get the GPS off the window and closer to my line of sight. And this product worked great. It palaces the GPS lower in my line of sight, doesn't obscure my view of the road, it's easier to read the screen, and I can hear the commands better. Also there isn't that tell tale mark on the inside of the windshield from the sucker letting others know you probably have a GPS in the car. The pad conforms well to the shape of the dash and does not slide around at all. Also one of the least expensive mounts, so all around a good product."
5,HOlds well to the dash of the car,"This is a must have for a portable GPS. The whole thing can be taken off the dash and stashed out of sight when leaving your car, deterring theft. It works amazingly well. I bought it because of its reviews here on Amazon and I have not been disappointed."
5,Good product..Great design and ease of use..A+++,"I had an earlier model of this friction mount and it was bigger and bulky. However it did its job. I was surprised when I opened the package. It was small, did an excellent job of staying on the dash and easily stored in our dodge minivan secondary storage compartment. Good design and versatile."
5,It is stable,My husband took his car for a wild ride to see whether the mount would shift.......no movement. It really works!
2,Long term review of product,"Worked fine for first few years, now the friction does not hold the dash like it used too.It will slide off if you are not careful. When I first got it would never move.Still better than using the windshield mounts, but base not being secure could be a safety hazard. I have had to catch it with one hand, while driving with the other."
4,Great item,"I've had this GPS friction mount for quite a while now and still like it. I don't use it but about twice a year. I've seen it slide just a little on the dash but not enough to complain about. Some people use theirs all the time for different reasons. My daughter has one that she leaves on her dashboard all the time and it looks terrible. It's all faded from the sun but as far as I know it hasn't interfered with the functionality of it. When not using mine I keep it down in the passenger side floorboard out of the sun's rays. I'd buy the same unit again, was pretty expensive though."
4,Friction mount,I like knowing that my gps will not be damage because it will stay in place. This is a good item to have.
5,Great addition,"We bought this for two reasons: 1) Our suction cup mount kept falling off of our windshield at inopportune times, and 2) With all the GPS related crimes on the rise, we didn't want our suction cup on the windshield or leaving a ring when we were out of the car.This product addresses both issues, as the mount stays put on the dash, and we can easily stow the friction mount under a seat or in the trunk. Great product, highly recommended."
5,Love It - Holds Firmly in Place!,"Great Product! I have a Garmin 50LM (5""). I took the advice of another reviewer and purchased a Handstands Original Sticky Pad and placed it under the Garmin Portable Friction Mount on the dashboard. Because the surface of the pad is tacky, the Friction Mount doesn't slide down the slanted dashboard. The Friction Mount also has a lock feature, so the GPS won't slip out of the Mount. No need to purchase any additional parts - I used the ball mount that came with the Garmin Friction Mount and pushed it into the snap-on bracket that was included with the GPS."
4,Great dash mount,Great for any dash and very adjustable for curves. Will not slide even in turns. Could be a little more attractive.
1,WORKED FOR A LITTLE WHILE,It worked for a few months. Now it literally goes flying off my dash. Almost broke my GPS and my window.
4,Review of Garmin Portable Friction Mount,"I ordered and received this GPS mount with my Garmin 265WT. It was easy to setup and it is stable on the dash of my Saturn Vue. I would like if the GPS was more compact, but I do understand the reason for the sjze and weight. I would recommend this mount."
5,Garmin Portable Friction Mount,"I see this as being superb product; using this in a Toyota Matrix and a Chrysler Sebring with having no problems at all. If you are having a problem keeping the pieces from getting lost to your Garmin, buy a hard shell travel case to keep everything together--yes the portable mount will fit in there also. Yep bought that from Amazon also--no complaints there. The case helps me from misplacing all that is necessary. Spend a little and save much aggravation. A much satisfied customer ending his review."
5,Perfect for my Prius,"Picked this up with the purchase of a Garmin Nuvi; It does just what it's supposed to do. The mount doesn't slide at all, it locks your GPS into place, and offers smooth rotation of the GPS so you can find your preferred viewing angle. The best part is the arm comes off with your GPS when you need to detach it. I remove it all the time to store it away when I don't plan on using the GPS for an extended period of time. Very convenient and easy to use. Great product."
4,review of garmin holder,"looks to be a good product does what it should although it is a bit bulky, would of looked for something else had i saw how big it really was, still it works well and i am happy with it"
4,Garmin Friction Mount for Nuvi Series,Pro: Excellent GPS mount. No sliding on the dashboardCon: Only the mount and no GPS adapter. You must have the original windshield mount with the part that clams your GPS in order to use this friction mount. Garmin should have included this adapter for the price that we paid.
5,Super!,This works great. The suction mount that came with my Nuvi was always falling off the windshield. This holds on very securely. I even tried taking some corners as fast and sharp as I could and it didn't budge.
5,Garmin Portable friction mount,"Great product. Packaging was as stated, frustration free.really stays put on your dash without moving.Thanks for the best idea for the garmin"
1,The neoprene bottom is very fragile,"Of poor quality. The neoprene bottom is very fragile and prone to developing holes and ripping. Very dissatisfied, never buy it again!"
5,So glad I got this,It works really well. Very heavy and stays on top of the dash all the time. We drove to the mountains and across several states couple of times in winter and summer after I bought it. Never had any issues. Love the fact that you can just put it anywhere on the dash and take it off effortlessly when done. Worth every penny.
4,This is really simple...,"This product is not, and doesn't need to be, high tech in any sense. It's simple, it works. I can't imagine a scenario in which the use of this item would cause any sort of problem. Buy with confidence."
4,Better than I expected,"I'm from Minnesota so the window mount is illegal. Like others, I didn't want to advertise my GPS ownership with a disc stuck on my dash. I was skeptical at how well this would work, but basically it was the only option so I gave it a shot. It does stick to the dash well on my Windstar and Silverado, and when it has moved, it has been less than an inch at a time. If you hit several potholes or large bumps, you may manage to shift it 6 inches before noticing and moving it back. I've never had it move on corners or from braking. I didn't think the size was all that bulky, it is about the same diameter as a volleyball and easily hides under the seat. I also had no problem connecting it to my Nuvi 260. My only negative is the price seems a little high for such a basic accessory."
3,OK,"what i like about this mount is that it doesn't leave a suction-cup mark on my windscreen and it is extremely portable. I can easily transfer it to a different car.The only problem i have with it is that it slides whenever you hit a bump in the road or sometimes even when you break hard.overall, it does what it does."
5,Garmin Bean Bag,Awesome product - do buy this works great and saves your windshield from melted rubber disc! Also makes it easy to stow on floorboard to prevent theft.
5,Hasn't slipped for us,"Pretty much everything said by most of the folks here holds. For us, in a Mitsubishi Gallant, we have NOT had the slipping beanbag problem YMMV."
5,Excellent Car Dashboard Mount,"I have tried 4 different type of GPS Car mount, None of them work, except friction mount. This is best mount for Garmin GPS."
5,Works as advertised,"For people who do not want to mount their GPS on the window or on the dash this item is perfect. it is a lot heavier than it looks. Once it is in place, it does not move. It can be stored in your glove compartment but is a little bulky."
4,It's good.,"Yeah, it's a little bulky, but maybe that's why it's so stable.The suction cup method was failing at most inopportune moments (GPS flies into mylap while dodging D.C. Beltway traffic, e.g.,) so I'm grateful that this thingworks."
5,Garmin Portable Mount,I bought this mount as I didn't want to hang the GPS from the windshield. This mount works excellently as it just simply sits on the dash (or anywhere else it is put) without any movement. It can be moved instantly and effortlessly. It holds the Nuvi in place perfectly. We even use it in the house for holding the Nuvi as it is used for the Bluetooth feather when on speaker phone.
4,Garmin dash mount,Works very well. It is fairly easy to use. The only problem noted is that when you touch the gps screen it will sometimes move.
5,Awesome product,"The Garmin Friction mount is an awesome product. I am very pleased with the way it stays on my dash, no sliding or movement at all. My friend had one and I got to try it out before I purchased. I was very pleased with it and of course ordered it from Amazon.com. Amazon has always given excellent service, price, and timely delivery."
4,MagusRanger,"The mounting unit, purchase thru Amazon, is quite versitile and due to friction and adequate flexibility it seems to fit all dashes that we have used it on. Probably a little over priced but worth not having to hassle with a window or non-friction mount. Should be included as a cheaper alternate when purchasing the GPS unit."
4,Worth getting at a discounted price,"Got it at less than half the list price from at Amazon.com. Much more convenient than the suction cup mount, which loses its stickiness after a while and isn't very portable. Fits pretty easily in my glove compartment when I'm not using it. I occasionally have to slightly readjust the angle of the GPS when driving, but this is a minor inconvenience. I definitely prefer this to the suction cup windshield mount."
5,Dashboard Mount for Select Garmin GPS,I love it!Much better than sticking the unit to the windshield.Does not slide around at all.Great accessory!
4,Great product,I bought this along with a Nuvi 660 and couldn't be happier. Works great on the dashboard and have had no issues with it sliding around whatsoever (I do have a flat dashboard). Highly recommend if you don't want to continually remove the suction mount to thwart thieve (and doesn't leave the round marks on your windshield!). I had an older Garmin in the past and found removing the suction mount annoying.
4,gps mount,it really stays in place on dash good even when taking sharp turns.i would highley recomend it.
4,stays put,It stays put on the left side of my dash and works great with the Garmin Nuvi200 that I purchased with the mount. Easy to remove the Nuvi200 to take it with me also.
4,convenient,"Very convenient. Unlike the holder that garmin nuvi200 comes with, this actually stays on the dash. I have been using it for almost 2 weeks and never had the GPS fall down. I like it."
3,Vibrates,"Before this I had a generic mount with a flat surface to which one attaches the gps using the sucktion holder. It would constantly pop up when driving, but while it was on it was very stable.This holder does not suffer from unmounting but is much lighter and looks less attractive. The annoying problem is often the GPS vibrates on it making distracting sounds."
5,Great GPS mounting option!!,"I have had terrible luck with the provided windshied mounting bracket and I knew that it was a matter of time before it finally broke. This ""beanbag"" type mount is wonderful. It fits perfectly in the corner of the dashboard and never moves."
5,great base for gps,"The Garmin friction mount is, in my opinion, a much better way to mount the gps in an automobile. If the power cord is connected, it isn't in the driver's view, and having the gps sitting on the dash allows the driver to have an uncluttered view of the road which is not the case with the suction mount on the windshield. It's easier to move and put in a hidden location than the windshield mount. Although the suction mount comes with a plate to mount it to the dash, it will always be stuck to the dash, and if removed later might damage the dash material. I love the friction mount. There is no hassle or damage to the dash. And if you need to use it in another vehicle, it's easy to move. I wouldn't want to do without it."
5,Very sturdy,"I was a little nervous if this would work or not, but much to my surprise...it is exactly what I needed. It doesn't move or slide at all when I'm turning sharp corners. I've been very pleased with this purchase!"
4,Garmin friction mount,The product works fine. I thought it was overpriced for what it really is. It is kind of like a weighted beanbag with a mount on it. But it does do the job.
5,EXCELLENT,"I absoultely HATED the window Mount for my Nuvi 660 it kept falling off during driving, causing me to have to try and reach for it etc and almost wrecking! I Found this thing, and WOW. It stays Put on dashboard, even dring sharp turns. It is so WORTH it... to buy this with your GPS. Those window mount things leave nasty rings in which THeives Look for to break in and steal your GPS. You can easily shove this under your seat ( After removing GPS) therby not leaving tell tale signs theres a GPS in your car! LOVE LOVE LOVE this! Happy with Purchase."
5,Garmin Friction Dashboard Mount is a worthy purchase,"For owners of a Garmin GPS, purchasing this accessory is easy to justify. The Garmin GPS connects easily to this dashboard mount and the non-slip pad keeps the mount in place even when rounding corners sharply or when breaking suddenly. The swivel piece makes it easy to position the Garmin for clear viewing. When you're finished with your trip, a simple push on the connecting clip allows you to collect your Garmin to store it away."
4,This Garmin pad worked fine for me!,This pad for the Garmin worked perfectly for my car and I believe it would for any vehicle.It never slides on the dash.
4,Holds Up Over Time,"I ordered this product in 2011 and over a year later, the mount is still working great. The mount fits my Garmin Nuvi GPS unit perfectly and fits easily into the center compartment of recent Toyota Camry models."
5,Works great,Very easy to use and sticks to the dashboard. We used it in two different cars and it was wonderful. A lot easier than using the suction cup.
4,Great alternative to a suction cup.,"This product works great. Only problem for me is it's size. I am sure this could have been made a bit smaller and still worked. Awkward to store in your car, not attractive but definitely holds the Gramin securely anywhere on the dash you like. Also, too costly."
5,best invention since...,"Fabulous product, exactly as advertised. Doesnt slide around on dash, doesnt leave telltale marks on your windshield and makes it easy to conceal if just dashing into store and whatnot. 2 thumbs up 5 stars yada yada"
4,Garmin Portable Friction Dashboard Mount for nüvi ... REVIEW.,"It works. It fits the Garmin Nuvi. It is used in a GMC Acadia. The suction cup used previously would not stay on the dash and if stuck on the windshield was not in a good location for driving vision nor easy reach. This dash mount stays in place in a convenient location in the center of the dash where it is easy to reach and can be seen by passengers, too. The location does not block view of traffic. ."
5,Good as advertised,"We used this pad for our 3,500 mile road trip from Seattle to the grand Canyon and beck. Went over many mountains, hair pin curves and freeways with crazy drivers and it NEVER moved. It stayed on the dash of our Honda Pilot without movement. Very Happy with the product!!!!!!!"
3,GPS Friction Mount,"I thought the portable friction mount would be universal for all GPS, I have three different styles. I can only use it with the Garmin. But it does fit the Garmin GPS very well."
5,great,"I had a sucktion cup holder before this. the sucktion left loose and my GPS got a crack on the screen, the liquid must have leaked and turn the screen black. This is sturdy and I don't think this can happen with this one."
5,"Genuine Product, Highly recommend.",Genuine Garmin Friction Mount. Best way to keep a GPS on your dashboard. I don't like suction cups on the windshield. They are too far for me to see and tend to obstruct my view.
4,Works Well,"I bought this so I could move my ""Suzuki Garmin NUVI"" from my Suzuki to my Motorhome. Combined it with a power adapter and cord, and now can have my GPS serve double duty in both the Vehicle and the Motorhome. Easy and inexpensive solution, really have no complaints."
5,No Problems,"As everyone else said, this product is perfect. I use it with the Garmin 350 GPS even though it didn't list that particular GPS as being compatible. Doesn't slide, tilt or tip. Adjustable knob allows you to change the direction of the GPS without having to take the GPS off the mount. Only thing with me is I switch from my personal car to my work car almost on a daily basis and it becomes another thing to drag around. I can't leave it in my personal car for fear of break-ins and I am not alwas guaranteed the same work car. Not Garmin's fault though. They could have included this with the GPS system itself as mounting on windshields in California is illegal."
5,My evaluation of the portable friction mount,"Does the job for the Garmin Nuvi 660! Absolutely the best stand in California because by law you cannot fix the GPS unit to the windshield. Sure its not pretty but its the best alternative you'll find if you do the research.Save yourself time. Make the purchase especially if you live in California or Minnnesota. Besides the suction mount (which comes with the GPS as part of the kit) lose ability to suction (especially with sun and heat) quickly.Can you say ""busted GPS"" or ""Oops, officer I didn't know...Please don't write that ticket""?"
4,Great Product,"Great purchase. Works perfectly and does not move. Wish it was easier to store, but no other issues. Would recommend."
5,Great idea,This keeps my GPS in place but also allows me to use it in other vehicles without needing multiple mounts. It is sturdy and easy to use.
5,Garmin Portable Friction Mount,"The Garmin Portable Friction mount is well thought out. It stays in position and can be stowed out of sight very easily when not in use. Before purchasing the Garmin, I experimented with my own mount design using velcro and tried other suction cup designs. Nothing works as well as the Garmin Portable Friction mount I bought on Amazon.com."
5,THIS THING STAYS PUT!,"My sister had one of these on her GPS and when I went to buy one, I wanted just what she had. All the crazy driving we did in Florida, that thing didn't move on the dash. Every stop, we just sat it on the floor, out of sight. Then when we got back, we would just sit it up on the dash again. No sticky tape or anything that would mess up you dash. Once you get one of these for your GPS, you will be thrilled at how great it is. It makes it easy to transfer your GPS from one vehicle to another. My truck needed repair while we were in Florida, so we transferred my sister's GPS from my truck to a rental car. If my sister had one of those sticky mounts, she probably wouldn't have brought her GPS with her and we would have been lost the whole trip. I think this is the best mount you could buy. I highly recommend it:)"
4,Satiisfied,It is exactly what I expectived. It can be moved around on the dashboard and still support the GPS unit.
4,Nice product,"This is a nice product. Held the GPS, but will tip when turning sharp corners. For the price it is a low cost option."
4,GPS within reach,My car has a deep dash due to the slope of the windshield. The friction mount brings the GPS unit within reach and keeps it in place.
5,The best you can buy,I just have to say - WOW!!!Amazing nice item. After I read some of the other reviews I decided to buy this friction dashboard and I'm not disappointed at all. I put it in my car and where I put it there it is STILL - did not move at all.I can highly recommend this product!
5,Garmin Dashboard Mount,I found this to be a great product at a very good price. It was just what I was looking for in a dashboard mount and it far exceeded my expectations.
5,great item,"this item works exactly as it should. It is much better than the suction cup mount I used previously, which would fail at least every half hour."
4,Love it...much better than the suction cup to the window!!!,"I love this Garmin holder. No longer do I have suction cup ring on my window. It moves side to side and up and down. My Jeep dashboard is a slight small but it still fits. I do notice that if I hit a good bump, the holder will shift. But that is only if I hit a good bump!!!"
3,"It's OK, but . . . .","I found that the friction mount is OK, but overly large for a Rav 4 dash. The Garmin 1450 sticks up just a little too far into my view of the road and does allow the Garmin to vibrate when I'm driving over rough roads. I think I'm going back to the windshield mount."
5,Just as expected,It is easy to use and very stable. We don't have any problems so far. Hope it will last for a long time.
5,Best way to mount GPS,I've had my friction mount for a few years and find it to be a really convenient hassle free way to use the GPS. The mount stays in place in the dash no problem. Equally nice is that the heavy base makes it easy to take the whole thing off - mount and GPS unit together - and store in the trunk or on the floor out of site without worrying about the GPS sliding around and scratching. I've had no problems with workmanship or wear.
5,way to go,"the garmin bean bag for its gps units is just perfect for the task. it's generally overpriced but with the amazon price, it's well worth considering. when you remove your gps as window breaking bait, there are no residual circles on your windshield nor evidence of the presence of the gps in the car. the removal of the gps from the dash could't be easier and the stability of the unit on the dash has been perfect for me. this is the 3rd unit i have purchased. one for each of my two cars, and this new one was for my daughter along with her garmin as a bday present."
5,Garmin dashboard mount,"Have used this on a number of trips now. Sticks to the dashboard no matter how hard I corner or brake. Much easier to use then sticking the mount to the windshield and leaving the tell tail circles on the windshield that you have something worth breaking in for. Speaking of breaking in, if your Garmin supports setting a pin I would suggest you do this. That way the bad guy has a useless GPS that he probably cannot sell."
5,Very pleased!,"So happy we bought this mount it stays in one place and does not move if turning or stopping,and moves to any location just by picking it up and move it."
5,Works like a charm!,"Stays in place, easier to reach the screen than when it was on my windshield , definitely would recommend to others"
4,as advertised,"Works like a charm. Holds my garmin steady on the dash. Packaging came nicely in a box, however there were no instructions included luckily it was a no brainer."
5,Good product,"I didn't want to mount my gps on the window, so tried this garmin friction mount. It works great. Doesn't slip off the dash no matter how I drive. The product also was shipped very promptly."
4,Stays on the dash and save shipping charges,"This stays on the dash well with my 5 inch NUVI GPS. Note that with unsecured things on you dash, if you get rear ended by someone going say 90 kph faster than you are, that stuff will probably end up in someone's face or throat. Apart from that, it stays in place in a Sienna and Camry zipping around town in light traffic or on the interstate. I paid the same price with Amazon as at Garmin but saved myself a lot of money on shipping with Amazon Prime and had it delivered in two days for no shipping charges. Thanks Amazon, you rock!"
3,It works good but is kind of clunky,"This is much easier to use than the snap in and snap off bracket that was falling off the window in the Florida heat.It's clunkier than the other one I had seen, so I'm a bit disapointed but glad that I have it anyway"
5,Much better way to mount GPS!,"I hate using the window mounts that come with the GPS. They make GPS hard to reach, hard to get on and off, harder to hide from thieves, and they are more likely to block the view.I have used this device for over 5 years, (my GPS was stolen along with this mount out of my drive way, car unlocked) but had to buy a new one.It stays on the dash during hard stops and starts, is not in the way, it is easy to move between cars or hide under the dash. There are other similar ones out there, but I have not used them. I ONLY use window mount when I fly to other cities and rent a car. This mount is a bit too heavy bring in carry on luggage."
2,Advertisement not correct,"Bought this bean bag for our second car. In the advertisement it said that it would fit a Garmin nuvi 660 but it does not come with a cradle that the 660 unit needs. Unfortunately, had to send it back to Amazon"
3,Volvo S80 Garmin Mount,"this is better than the suction cup gizmo, but it still slides off the dash occasionally."
5,Awesome Product,My suction cup mount broke within few months after purchase. I am glad that I purchased this Dashboard Mount for my Garmin Nuvi. It is working good so far! Very easy to use.
5,Garmin friction mount review,I was very concerned when I first got it that it may slip off the dashboard when the car stops suddenly. This mount sticks to the dashboard like a big rock. Excellent.
2,Cheap but no cradle !!,I did not check detail of the delivery items but i expect it should come with cradle which is the key component.I did not have it and have to find and it myself which give me mad.
5,Very useful,I love this product. It contours to your dash and stays there. The only time it didn't stay on my dash is when I had to go over a very bumpy dirt road. Nothing stays in place then! It doesn't rattle like the ones you suction to the windshield.
5,Best way to mount your GPS!,"Easy to use, and easy to take down. Doesn't move around at all, and makes it really easy to take your GPS down and put it in the trunk so there will be no reason for someone to break into your car to try to get the GPS that is likely in your glove compartment."
4,Works alright,"this product works good, but rarely ever use it now that gps is standard on any smart phone. but if you use your garmin often, it is a decent buy."
5,Fills my needs,It simply accomplishes what I need to use my Garmin efficiently and allows me to move away from the window area when not in use to help prevent potential theft of my Garmin.
5,portable frinction mount,the friction mount holds the Garmin in place and holds the the dash of my car. I am very satisfied with the friction mount.
5,Great!!!!,This product is awesome!! I love how i dont have to worry about my GPS sliding off my windshield or if it is going to slide around. This product keeps your Garmin where you put it!! Great buy!!
5,Perfect if you use your device on the go,"I use my device on the go from rental car to rental car. This is product is perfect because I can easily place and remove my garmin with ease on and off the dash. I've only had it for a short time however and can't testify to its durability however, only time will tell."
5,A Great Solution,"I purchased this several years ago, shortly after I received my Garmin. The mount that came with my nuvi kept falling off the windshield and I couldn't find a place to mount it that it didn't interfere with my field of vision. This seemed like a great solution, to sit on my dash but I was concerned it wouldn't stay there. After several vehicles and much use, it has never fallen off or moved around. It stays where I put. Highly recommend it."
5,Garmin Mount,Best mount I ever had for any product. Wish I could get it to work with my radar dectector.
5,Just what the doctor ordered.,I had been using the window mount and found it to be very distracting. The dash mount can be placed in a spot that is perfect for the driver or passenger to view. It stays in place and does not move when stopping suddenly. I would have to say that it is far superior to the window mount and am sorry that I waited as long as I did to purchase it.
5,Love my friction mount,I've just recently started ordering misc. items from Amazon. com . This has to be my best purchase for quality and price! I would highly recommend this Garmin portable friction mount to anyone who is considering a device to secure your GPS unit in your car.
5,Great,I have 2001 Corvette I tryed everything and the Garmin friction mount stayed put.Great no trouble at all.Also I have 3 other cars it makes easy to move. My wife always take it down when we leave the car this is a lot more handy for her to do.Handyman
5,The Garmin Portable Friction Mount,The Garmin Portable Friction Mount is a great product. Nice knowing that it stays where you place it on your dashboard.
5,Friction Mount for Garmin Nuvi 650,"I recently (Nov, 2007) purchased a Garmin Portable Friction Mount for my Nuvi 650. Well, I am happy to report it works just as described. It is easy to use and stays on the dashboard. It is easy to detach so that I can slip it under my seat and take my 650 with me or hide it somewhere. I highly recommend this as a much better alternative to using the suction mount that comes with the unit. Using the friction mount is a way not to leave a mark on my windshield that is a giveaway to potential thieves that I have a gps unit. Also, in some states it is illegal to use a suction mount.I strongly suggest that Garmin include this mount with the unit instead of the suction mount.I bought my friction mount on Amazon.com for under $28 with free shipping.I also highly recommend the Garmin Nuvi 650. I got it at Costco.com for $299.99 plus some fees."
5,Stays On The Dash,Very impressive. This stays on the dash even during a quick stop. Great for moving your GPS to a different vehicle.
3,Not for Zumo,"I purchased the Garmin dashboard mount thinking it would be a cheaper alternative to mount my Garmin Zumo 450 in my car and van. The dashboard mount's ball receiver is too small to accept the Zumo's screw down clamp. I was able to clamp it onto the arm of the mount which works well in my Ford van which has a large, flat dashboard. My Hyundai Elantra has a small, uneven dash and the assembled unit slid off several times before I gave up. For the safety of your Zumo 450 or 550 motorcycle GPS, I would not recommend the dashboard mount. Garmin makes a window mount for the Zumo which would be more reliable if you don't mind spending the extra money."
2,Fails as it ages,For the first year it was great then it no longer gripped the dash. It's now relagated to being on the seat next to me or held by my passenger. The foam material has completely dried out and lost all grip ability. I've read that the heat that builds up in the car when parked may have caused this. I say to expect a driver to remove with them when they exit the car is a little more than unusual. It should be designed to withstand the heat and remain a functionable item. If you don't mind buying a new one every year I would avoid and look for an alternative.
5,Garmin friction mount,The very best mount on the market to keep the GPS stable on a slick dash. It had evough setting t amke it usable at all angles. Buy it you'll be happy!
5,Garmin dashboard mount,"This is an ideal tool for holding the Garmin in place. It stays in place, and keeps the GPS in place, extremely well, and is easy to remove, leaving no evidence that we have a GPS. I strongly recommend it."
4,dashboard mount,A better way to mount the GPS on the dash. You can move it to different locations on the dash and to other vehicles.
5,Impressed!,"Have to admit I was skeptical even after reading the raving reviews here, but got this friction mount anyway when I bought the Nuvi 660. Very impressed with how easy to use and how well this worked with the GPS unit. It never moves during driving!"
5,Works great,"I'm glad I ordered this holder. I didn't want to stick anything to the dash in my new vechicle, and I just didn't like the idea of having my GPS mounted on the windshield. I absolutely love this mount. It's so easy to pick it up and stow it in the console when not in use. Of course, transferring it to another vhicle is a piece of cake. I highly recommend it."
4,Garmin Portable Friction Dashboard Mount for Nüvi,"I love this mount. I keep my GPS in the mount and store it in a compartment under my dash. When I'm ready to use it, I pull it out and throw it on the dash. The only negative could be that the mount is rather large and anyone with a small dash would have a problem.Garmin Portable Friction Dashboard Mount for Nüvi Series and StreetPilot C5XX Series GPS Navigators (C530, C550 and C580)"
5,GREAT SOLUTION,"We received a Garmin 1450 for Christmas (great gift!) but after one 7 hour trip (with several stops) we decided the enclosed window suction cup type mount had to go. Did some research @ Best Buy & Amazon on ""friction mounts"". Although it was a little pricey compared to some, we pulled the trigger on the Garmin friction mount. Great decision !!! Although our 2010 Corolla does not have a flat dash, the mount holds our 1450 perfectly. Very easy to attach the GPS unit & just as easy to seperate. Ideal when making a pit stop - can quickly remove the GPS from the friction mount, and hide both & then reassemble to continue the trip. Just one heads up - we have noticed after long trips the dash looks ""scratched"" where friction mount sat. These ""scratches"" buff out easily - not permanent damage, just slight scuffing that disappears with a little elbow grease. Bottom line, buy it - you'll be very happy with this product. Thanks Amazon !"
4,better than stick on glass or dash,"I am very pleased with the product. it works great so far. only had it about a month. it works great for what its used for. its stable, reliable, easily removable and can be hidden easily. you can remove the gps very easily in a snap. I only wished it was a bit smaller. all in all this is a must have product for gps.. beats mounting on glass or sticking it with adhesive to the dash.Garmin Portable Friction Mount"
4,Surprisingly effective,"When my last GPS mount (Bracketron UFM-100BL Nav-Mat GPS Friction Dash Pad) lost its stickiness and began to slide around the dash like a puck on ice I bought this to replace it.It's lighter than the Bracketron mount and the bottom didn't feel particularly grippy so I was skeptical that it would work that well. I was wrong...it's extremely stable and doesn't move during hard cornering. As an added bonus, I don't need to use the suction cup mount (as I did with my previous dash pad). From time to time (hot days usually) the suction would fail and I'd have to re-seat the mount on the pad. My Nuvi fits on it perfectly (as it should...both products are from Garmin) and I can easily adjust the screen to a good viewing angle.Even though the price dropped since I purchased it a few weeks ago I think it's still priced too high for what you get (it's 2.5x more expensive than my previous one). You definitely won't be disappointed in the product itself, just what you get for your money."
5,Worked as advertised,Very simple to install and we can easily move the gps from one car to another. It seems to stay in place pretty well. Drove with it on some windy roads and it stayed put. I think it would go flying if I had to stop really fast however.
5,Great product,"I am very pleased with this product. I did not want to put an adhesive circle on my dash, and didn't like the windshield mount, so this is a great alternative. My dashboard is textured and has a ridge in it's design, but this mount stays put anyway. It doesn't even shift with quick stops or sharp turns. It leaves no telltale marks and does not block your view like the windshield mounts do, but it does hold your GPS in a comfortable viewing position. It's easy to store too. I put the base in the seat pocket behind the passenger seat, and just toss the stalk into the glove compartment. I would highly recommend it to others."
4,Functional and Inconspicuous,"I hated to use the suction cup windshield holder for my Nuvi 360, especially on rental cars. Inevitably, the cup would lose its suction, causing the GPS unit to fall unexpectedly. Worse yet, I learned that laws in certain states prohibit anything to be affixed to the front or side windows. This portable friction mount now allows me to inconspicuously mount the GPS unit on the dashboard, console, or even some steering wheel columns. It fits the Nuvi 360 perfectly."
5,Perfect Solution,"From my brother's experiences I knew already that windshield mounts are no good to move between cars. So, I bought this Friction mount with my new Garmin 360. I can easily switch it between my car and my wife's Van. It always stays in place on the dashboard. I tried a few sudden stops and sharp turns when there was no traffic. It just stays in place. Perfect product."
5,great purchase for the price,"I bought one for my GPS, one for my wife and now one for my father-in-law. It works great, no complaints. It stays on the dashboard with no problem, and it does not fall off at all."
4,GPS Mount,I was satisfied with my purchase. The base is stable and it is easy to transport from vehicle to vehicle.
5,Great Product,"Garmin fit perfectly in the mount, It does not slip around, it fact in never moves. It is easy to read and easy to use. I am able to keep my eyes on the road."
5,Great mount,The mount is awesome! I thought there was more to making it sit on the dash but it just sits there. It does not move at all!! Unbelievable!!!
5,garmin dash gps mount,"Bought for my daughter, I already own one. It is very useful for my gps. Very satisfied with function and price."
5,Great product!,Works wonderfully! No more garmin falling off the windshield when it gets hot out. No sliding or moving. I love it.
3,A Bit Shaky,"I purchased this mount to replace the suction cup window mount that came with my Nuvi 660. Unfortunately, when placed on my F-150 dashboard, my Nuvi 660 shakes and makes looking at the display annoying. Went back to the window mount. Other than the shake, the unit performed as described."
5,Garmin Portable Friction Dashboard Mount,The Garmin Portable Friction Dashboard Mount was a great purchase for me as it was about 50% less in price than I found anywhere else. Thank you for a great deal.
5,Works perfectly,This is such a great product! I just bought a StreetPilot c550 and it holds my GPS very well in both my car and my husband's truck.
5,Useful accessory,"Got this to use with the Nuvi. Holds well on the dash, easy to move from car-car. Would be better if the arm would fold over somehow, as it sticks up and takes up a bit more space when stuck in a bag or briefcase, but it really isn't that much of an issue.Good accessory, highly recommended."
5,It really works!,I had my suspicions when Ibought this but I really wanted the ability to place in different vehicles etc....I cannot belive how still the friction mount sits on the dash and how portable it is. Transaction was great too!
5,No slipping around,"Works very nice, have used it several different spots on the dash. Works great where ever you set it. I even set on the slanted portion of my dash didn't move at all."
5,Mount,Husband received the garmin so had to have the portabel friction mount. This works great. Sure beats hanging it to the window.
3,Highly Recommend!,"I bought this for my nuvi 265W and it really is amazing! I'm a moderately fast driver (no super crazy turns but I do rush to campus sometimes) and so far, this mount has worked fine. No slips or complaints so far. I also love how it is portable so I can just hide it beneath my seat or use it on other cars. I highly recommend this product!!!UPDATE: After about a year and a half, the mount's ability to stay on my dashboard has diminished completely. (As a result, I've downgraded the rating from 5 to 3 stars.) The mount, along with my gps, falls without fail at least once every drive. This is very frustrating but as I cannot find a better option out there, I'm going to have to purchase a new one."
5,Garmin,"Great product. Beats the windshield suction device which is illegal in California. It is very portable and stays in a fixed position wherever placed on the dashboard. It does not move even on a road of pot holes. Great device, works well with my Garmin Nuvi. Highly recommended."
4,works well,"Friction mount works well under all but ""quick stop"" conditions. Having it sitting on the dash enables a quick transfer to the floor or console when leaving the vehicle - out of sight = out of mind."
5,Outstanding,"About two days after getting this someone pulled in front of me on the highway and I had to lock up the wheels going 70 mph. Everything in the van flew forward, but my GPS DID NOT MOVE."
5,Definitely get one of these!,"This stand is perfect for mounting the Garmin on your dashboard. Once you put it in place, it stays there. I have taken very sharp turns at 40 mph and this thing stays put. Highly recommended, especially if you buy it at Amazon; You can't beat the price! 5*-Kyle"
5,Best Garmin accessory,"This accessory works great and I would say that it's a ""must have"" with any garmin gps. I have used it in several different autos and it works great with good grip and versatility in all cases. It's locking mechcanism works firmly and smoothly. It's a very secure and portable way to mount your gps. I actually like it better than the windshield suction cup that comes with the gps systems."
4,Great Product,"Unless you make a VERY sudden stop or a very SHARP turn, it stays in place and the GPS is safe. Love it!"
5,Portable GPS Dash Mount,This is a very capable system. Makes the GPS positioning very simple and does not leave an imprint that lets people know you have a GPS in the car.We just made a 2600 mile trip on very curvy and inclined roads in a rental car and had no stability or visibility problems. I would highly recommend this item for anyone who wants a portable GPS unit.
5,Garmin Portable Friction Mount,The item is very convenient and very easy to install. It is much safer than the old window suction mount. I would recommend this item to anyone who is looking for a safer and easier product to use with your Garmin GPS units.
5,Garmin weighted dash mount for Nuvi,"I tried this out when recieved and it does seem to work well.It keeps the unit in place and is easy to use.It will be great for rental car use.Worth the money.No more marks on the windshield,"
4,Friction dashboard mount,Works well and you can quickly conceal everything on the car floor when stopping. Easier to use than the supplied wind-shield suction cup.
4,works great on flat dashboards,"Works great on the big, flat dash of my Ford Explorer but would fall off a sloped dashboard. Nice, easy clip in and out so I can remove the unit and reinstall very easily."
5,Holds tight.,The friction mount holds up well under normal driving conditions. The rubber pad seems to grip the dash so well I have not seen it move.It is nice not to have little circles on my windshield anymore.The mount is quick to move from vehicle to vehicle and you can position the screen in any direction.
1,I have no use for it.,This unit is for the Garmin Nuvi that I can't use. I made a mistake buying it. Eventually I might find someone to give these to.
1,"Good GPS mount, but the screws on the bottom keep coming off.","Good mount for my gps, but there are some issues with it.Pros:- Very stable, keeps my gps in place.Cons:- There are four screws on the bottom that easily come off and get lost. I've been having lots of problems with this, and so far, I've lost 2 screws, so the mount top is wobbly. I'm far too lazy to contact Garmin to ask them to send me some new screws to secure the base.Recommend?Yes, despite the one star review. If you need a gps mount, this is probably your best bet.If any Garmin representatives are reading this, I'll update my review to four stars if you contact me and provide me with some screws to secure the base."
1,Unuseable,"It doesn't fit anywhere on my dash, and before I tried to position it, I was unable to snap the mounting post to the GPS Garmin. It is useless to me and I cannot return it because it is opened."
1,Garmin Portable Friction Mount,Garmin Portable Friction MountThis rating...simply because it did not work with my old garmin despite listing my number on the garmin
5,The perfect solution,I was frustrated with the Garmin suction cup that kept falling off while I was driving. So I bought this mount for my Garmin. I've now used it in two cars with two different styles of dash board and it works great. It never slips and is easy to remove when not driving. I love it.
5,Worked well,The mount stays in palce extremely well- we are very happy with it. We have used it in a Toyota Highlander and an Accura without any sliding off.
2,portable friction mount,I don't have anything bad to say about the product itself. It just didn't fit my GPS and I enjoy a window mounted unit better. Be sure to check that this item matches the type of GPS you have.
4,Great companion,I brought this because I California state doesn't allow window mount. The stand is a great companion. It gives a better view by sitting in top of dash bord. With in Hand reach control. The only complain is the bottom layer material is not very durable. It show wear out at the inside corner after my 20 days use of travel.
1,Unusable!,Unusable! The ball is too big to fit into the back of my Garmin. The mount that came with my Garmin had the same problem. I'll donate it to Goodwill. Maybe someone can use it. I just drive with my GPS on the seat next to me.
1,Cheap product,"I used this Garmin friction mount maybe a half dozen times. Then the cigarette lighter insert fell apart. Junk. Otherwise, it worked well."
1,I will not buy never at Beach Camera anything.,"1 of: Garmin Portable Friction Mount [Electronics]Condition: NewSold by: Beach Camera (seller profile)I bought a new product, and have received not new: without firm packing, in very small box in which the product was deformed and demanded repair.It has not return because it expensively and money does not return. With Beach Camera did not communicate, because I know English badly and to me it is difficult.I will not buy never at Beach Camera anything."
5,No problem,"When the advertise the no skid/slide bottom, they mean it. It has been on my dash for 6 month and never moved a bit. The vendor was very prompt in delivering the goods in perfect condition. I will not hesitate in ordering from this vendor again."
5,great product,"I have had the mount for about a month now and it is great so far. It is nice not to have something hanging on your windshield. It sits down low and puts my gps within closer reach. And my biggest concern was weather it would stay in place, but this mount hasn't moved since I got it. I would absolutely recommend it."
4,Awesome,"After going through lots of bad reviews for the windshield based mounts, I decided to buy this and I am very glad I did. This is a neat piece of product for a cool price. The rubber kinda base (which is even better compared to the sticky ones) makes it stand still on the dashboard even when you bring the vehicle to an immediate stop or take it for a wild turn. I wish I could rate it for 5 stars but due to the size the base occupies (would have been perfect if the base was slightly smaller), I am giving a 4. I have not a single drop of regret for buying this and would certainly recommend this great product to everyone."
1,Bean Bag Mounting BracketuUseless as a replacement mount.,"I bought this as a replacement for the suction cup mounting that I lost on a trip when I left it in a rental car. This Friction Mount is completely useless unless you have the mounting bracket that came with the original unit that fits on the ball. This unit does not come with a mounting bracket needed to mount the Nuvi 200W. The cradle should be a standard accessory for this unit. To make things worse, you cannot buy just the cradle (from Garmin or any 3rd party). I have to buy the entire suction cup unit to get a replacement cradle to use with this useless bean bag mount. Garmin should ship the cradle / ball attachment with this unit. Without it the unit is useless."
2,NEVER GOT ITEM,I ordered this item with good intentions but I never got the item and never received an e-mail back from my e-mails to find out where it was.I entered a claim and got my money back.
2,Not the best product,This item is way too big and gaudy looking in my car. My window mount was much more discreet. I returned this product right away.
1,Good Product but bad Customer Service,"Hi,this is second one I bought because I lost the arm of the first one I bought. While I really like this product I didn`t like the ""no can`t do"" response from Garmin when I contacted them about selling me the arm separately.Thank you"
5,Frustration Free Packaging Is Great,"This mount is nice for the GPS because the suction cups tend to fall off of the window. You can move the beanbag around to get it in the right spot, and it doesn't skid. The packaging was wonderful!"
5,Great! Works perfect,Great! Works perfect and holds everything down. Doesnt slide. Worth the price. Id get it again and the company seems fine!
5,"Sturdy, Flexible and Easy to Use","I have had this mount in my car for a week or so now, and I really like it. It does not move around, and holds the GPS unit (the nuvi 2595) at my eye level, and closer than the windshield-suction mount."
5,Garmin dash mount,"I love this mount, no more dropping my gps from the window mount comming un-stuck. This unit sets on the dash and never moves. It is fantastic, the units should come with this instead of the suction cup mount. Well worth the money."
2,Not great but there aren't many options,"This is a lot better than trying to use a windshield mount, but still. This thing slides all over the place on my dash. Its four ""toes"" curl up and result in the mount not staying in place. It's big and hard to conceal - if I don't want to remove the GPS from it every time I park, that means I have to tuck the whole thing as best I can under the seat and hope nobody sees it. It's not terribly hard to remove from the GPS if you do it the proper way, but it's very easy to do it another, improper way (removal of the ball from the ""GPS holder"") which after a few times results in broken plastic strips on the ""GPS holder"" and the mount no longer mounting to the GPS holder (which I've now had to replace twice).But, I don't know of any other options - there might be some generic ones. And it's a lot better than using the default windshield mount, which is awful and results in your GPS repeatedly dropping onto the ground or dash. I just can't say that I like it."
3,Directions needed,"The Garmin holder was promptly received, however there were no directions. To date, I haven't been able to figure out how to hook it up."
4,Bulky but works so far,"I've had it for five months now, and it works well; but it's bulky. Because of all the charging cables for my other electronic devices, when I started storing the friction mount in my glove compartment, I had to store my car's owner's manual in the trunk because the mount took up so much room. However, this was my only option. Some have reported that it starts to slide after a while. Mine hasn't done that. Could it be because I don't clean and Armour All my dash board as often as I should?UPDATE: I've had it almost a year, and mine slides a little but still not much. I've been avoiding ArmorAlling that spot.UPDATE: After about a year and a half, it started to slide."
2,"Boy Did I screw up...Wrong, Wrong, Wrong...not for c330",I did not realize there were different ways of mounting the Garmin. The dashmount looked good on Amazon and I wanted to get the C330 off the window.I put it on my wish list and my wife got it for my birthday. It does come not close to what I need to mount the C330. I tried retrofiting the socket on part of the window mount that attaches to the Garmin. That doesn't work either. In the process I broke off on side of the clamping section so now I have a Garmin C330 that my wife is going to have to hold next to the window to get it to work. You know she is not going to be happy about that. I may just go down in the basement and manufacture something that will hold the unit in the dashmount.
3,mount for use on a dashboard or center console,The mount is pretty small so it will fit most places on a dashboard. My main complaint is that the bracket pops off the ball joint too easily when you adjust the angle. Then you have to snap it back on. Not convenient when driving.
5,Good buy,"This is an excellent product. We recently took a trip from New York State to Texas and took our GPS and dashboard mount with us. It came in so handy to find places we wanted to visit, restaurants, airports and car rental agencies. We would highly recommend it!!"
4,Friction pad works great,Pad works as advertised and stays in place letting you position it anywhere you like. My concern is the ball mount on the back of the GPS unit itself. It is already starting to loosen up in less than a month of ownership and I do not see a fix for it except the need to keep purchasing new ball mounts which would add up quickly.
5,Great,This keeps the GPS on your dash without it moving around. Allot better than having to stick it to your window.
4,Very nice,"I like the dash mount accessory for my Garming GPS. It works much better than the suction cup version especially in the summer. The suction cup let's go when the car gets hot causing the GPS to fall, this mount does not have that issue and it does a good job of staying in place on the dash."
3,Good but not a must,"My sister recommanded it to me when I was about to purchase a Garmin GPS. It turned out to be a good but since the original mount works good for me too, this one does not seem to worth the $20+ I spent, at least for now."
5,Exactly what I wanted,"I have had windshield mounts in the past and they are okay - they work. I LOVE this mount. It's heavily weighted so that it won't move around (even during the most daring turns), each flap has a flexible metal tab inside so that you can shape it around almost any shaped dash. Another reviewer said ""this is the best mounting solution I've found for a GPS or any other device for my car. It hasn't slid out of place once!!"" They're right. Love this thing. It is exactly what it's supposed to be."
5,Best mount for a Nuvi,This is the best mount that there is for a Nuvi. It never moves and allows you to position at any horizontal or vertical angle. Very easy to use.
3,Garmin Friction Mount,"Product is okay, but rather bulky. Keeps my GPS from sliding all over the place, but the best place I found to keep the friction mount is on the passenger seat, not the dashboard, where it would be easiest to view.The bulky mount has to be put away to not alert anyone there is possibly a GPS in the car to steal, so I don't get it out very often and it takes up a lot of storage space in the limited compartments in my car."
1,Not the current design,"I ordered one of these in Nov 2010 and ended up giving it to my father-in-law for Christmas after his daughters got him a GPS. So I ordered another one for my wife for her new GPS in Jan 2011. The one we received from ""Agent Frugal"" was not the current design, in fact it was two versions old. Instead of easily molding to the dash of the car it has a large metal plate under most of the pad so the mount is very ridged. Not cool. The current design from Garmin ends in a -02, as opposed to the -00 that we received. To order it I just pulled up our past order and click on the item then added it to our shopping cart. I had no idea Amazon would change sellers on us (the first one we order came from Amazon, as opposed to being ""fullfilled by Amazon""). Buyer beware!"
4,Must Have for Owners of Garmin Nuvi Family of GPS,"If you bought a Garmin Nuvi GPS, the friction mount is a MUST since the suction mount which comes with the GPS is difficult to detach and hide when you park the car. Furthermore, there are some reports that thieves are looking for any evidence of a suction mount marking on the car and break into the cars.The friction mount was easy to adjust for any viewing angle and never budged in all road conditions.The only negative is that it is rather large and difficult to store in the car if you have only limited storage in the car."
4,"Great Product, Great Price",Friction pad works as advertised. Lowest price (even with shipping) than any big box store or electronics store.
3,Universal Garmin Mount,It works for me but my existing GPS connection piece does not hold my Garmin up. It droops down. I have had to place my GPS case under it to keep it up and I cannot operated with one hand. Is there an adapter for the ball on the end?
5,GPS portable friction mount,"We could never get the window mount that came with our GPS to stick on the windshield.We purchased the Garmin friction mount from Amazon the day before going on a weekend trip. We had previously used our neighbor's bean bag mount on a previous trip and found it to be useful but we had to make adjustments regularly as it tended to move.We love this friction mount. It never moves no matter how rough the road is, it looks much better than the bean bag, it doesn't obstruct your vision, it holds your GPS firmly--while allowing you to easily adjust,attach and remove it from the mount."
5,Definitely worth the money!,This item is great. It does exactly what it says it will do. The GPS sits on the dash and doesn't move when mounted in the friction mount. It's much better than trying to attach it to the windshield using a suction cup. Amazon's price was the lowest I found. Definitely worth the money!
4,useful product.,"Useful product. Because in California, we are not allowed to stick the GPS on the windshield."
5,Great Product,"I purchased this for a Garmin 660 Nuvi. It works great! Its much better than fooling with the suction cup that comes with the Garmin. Its nice to be able to quickly take it off and on the dash. With all the thefts reported, there is much less worry now that I have this item. You can place the mount on your dash in any direction because the inner circle rotates 360 degrees. The unit is heavy enough so it does not slide on the dash. I am so happy I purchased this!"
2,NOT for nuvi885t,Doesn't fit nuvi885t. Mounting ball on stalk is too big for thepower and mounting plate that holds the nuvi
4,Excellent product,Excellent product works exactly as described. Would have given 5 stars but it's size makes it inconvenient for travel. I still take the window mount with me when renting cars while traveling.
5,Handy to have,"This is handy device that is dedicated to many Garmin GPS units. It is weighted enough to hold itself on various dashes. The surface is rather ""grippy"" and holds my Garmin even on very rough 4X4 roads.This temporary mounting makes it easy to ""hide"" or remove GPS when parked and easy to move from vehicle to vehicle."
5,"Garmin Portable Friction Dashboard Mount for Nüvi Series and StreetPilot C5XX Series GPS Navigators (C530, C550 and C580)","Garmin Portable Friction Dashboard Mount for Nüvi Series and StreetPilot C5XX Series GPS Navigators (C530, C550 and C580)The Garmin Portable Friction Dash Mount for the NUVI Series GPS provides a secure, stable mount for the GPS unit. This mount is not affected by temperature fluctuations that can cause the windshield suction cup mount to release."
4,best mounting solution I've found for Garmin GPS,"This works much better than the suction cup mounts which always seem to fall. My only complaint is that with time the bottom becomes smooth, rather than ""friction-y"" causing the unit to slide around the dashboard, making it unusable. In fairness, this occurred after two years of sitting on my dashboard, often parked in the hot sun. I have not found a more durable/functional mounting solution for my garmin."
5,stays in place,Great product!! Stays in place even with the way my boyfriend drives LOL. Allows the Garmin to be right in front of you on the dashboard. Would recommend this product.
2,TPSD,"Bought this and it needs to go back. I have a 12' jeep liberty and while it fits, there's no way to make it ""stick"". Its heavy (its like a bean bag) and maybe on some dashes it might stay in place but I just don't want to take the chance. If it had velcro or something like it, this would be a solid product."
5,Garmin portable mount,"Love this mount. I can place it any where and at any angle on the dash board and it doesn't move. It's portable so I can use it in my car or my husbands. You can put it away when not in use and no marks on the windshield, so no one knows you have a GPS. The price was good and well worth it. It came fast and super easy to use. I would highly recommend this product."
4,Perfect mount,"Perfect mount for your GPS in either a car or truck, I use it in both. I've tried other mounts but this one can be used just about anywhere in your car. It's easy to position and will stay were you want it."
5,Beats all Mounts,Highly recommended. This mount was a replacedment for my earlier windshield mount and i cannot be happier. It is perfect!!! worth every penny.
5,This is the perfect way to mount a GPS,"Suction cups fall off when weather changes and let criminals know that you have valuables inside. This stand never moves on my dashboard and is easy to hide when I get out of the car. My dash is inclined around 20 degrees, but it never slides during any driving conditions. Get it."
4,GPS steady,Finally a product that will keep my GPS on the dash. Great idea - great product - works exactly like I wanted.
5,Handy Item!,"Since I rent cars often, I like the convenience of popping this into my carry-on bag for the rental car. It is designed so once placed on the dash (no matter how narrow) it doesn't budge. This way I don't have to keep attaching and detaching the window mount that comes with the Garmin. Highly recommend this accessory."
5,Garmin Portable Friction Dashboard Mount for nüvi Series,This product works as advertised. It sits on my dash and does not move around.
4,Slides with age,"We use the Garmin in the bean-bag friction mount about four days a month and have owned this mount for about three years. Lately within the past year, it is starting to slide alot on turns or stops. You have to locate it on the dash near a hump or else it slides. Like everything else these days, nothing lasts more than a few years!"
5,Wish I got this years ago!,This mount works great with my old Garmin Nuvi GPS. The mount sits on my dash and has not slipped off even when the ride gets bumpy. I got it for $12.21 and it was worth every penny.
5,Best Buy,I was very reluctant to buy this item. I could not figure out how it would work from the picture. After receiving it I could not be more pleased. The little ball-like extension that you see is so that it can charge while on the mount. Cool! I drive on some very bumpy streets and have to take some serious curves and it never moves. My kids don't have to hold it! I don't have to look down while I drive. Heaven!Do not be put off any longer. Buy it and hide it under your seat when you get out of the car. This is great!!!Nuvi & StreetPilot Mount
4,Car mount for Nuvi 350,"This product works well. I have a Chevy Uplander and it holds onto the dash well. It turns easily for viewing by either the driver or co-pilot, and drops out of sight when not in use. Good buy."
5,Wonderful!,"If you have the Garmin GPS nuvi or street pilot, you must get this. It is the best way to mount your GPS. Never use the suction cup it is not good, not portable and leaves marks on your windshield which thieves recognize as you having a GPS. This is easy to set up and use. Love it!!!"
5,Garmin portable mount,"excellent product, it stays in place on dash and gives you the freedom to take it from vehicle to another"
5,Great product,"I use the Garmin friction mount for my newly acquired Nuvi 660 which sits on the dash board of the newly acquired Nissan Altima. No black marks on the windshield (also illegal in Mn.) from a suction cup and no left over adhesive on the dash board from the adhesive disc. I have only used the mount for about four weeks but have found that it does not move, holds the Nuvi 660 firmly and I did not need any additional parts for the installation. To my mind it is a bit pricey but rather than have the Nuvi hit the dirt at some time, I would bite the bullet and pay the price. It is a great product."
4,Garmin Portable Friction Dashboard Mount for nüvi,"THIS ITEM WAS A GREAT FIT FOR MY NUVI 200 SERIES.THE SCREEN DOES NOT FALL OFF THE MOUNT ON TURNS, SUDDEN STOPS, ETC. NO ISSUES AT ALL."
3,seems incomplete but probably not,I am not sure if the one I ordered was missing a piece or if all of them areBUYER BEWAREin the OEM mount there are 3 pieces...the basethe 90 degree armand the bit that the GPS clips intothe friction mount I received has a weighted (fabric) basethe 90 degree pieceand NO CLIP PORTIONyours may not have this clip portion either...if you don't have your OEM clip bit be careful in ordering this unitluckily I ordered my GPS at the same time so I DO have the missing piece from the OEMhowever it would be nice to have 2 of them so I wouldnt have to forcefully pry the clip off the 90 degree piece to put it on the other mount (i.e moving the unit from one vehicle to another)I worry about breaking the clip piece as I cant find where to order another one...
3,Not as stable as I'd hoped,"The mount seems to be of good quality and construction, but does not provide the stability for the GPS unit as I'd hoped it would. The GPS bounces around just a little more than I'd like when driving, but the bigger issue is when trying to press the the on-screen controls/buttons (which require a fair amount of pressure on the touchscreen) -- the GPS unit moves noticeably and it's difficult to get something like an address typed into the unit without pushing it and the mount around on the dash a bit. I opted to use the window mount suction cup."
5,I wonder why I didn't buy this in the first place,"i tried the suction cup on the windshield, and the grill holder and this is without a doubt the best!! its an idea that is so simple but works so very well. highly recommend!!(please note you will need the actual holder/clip that comes with your garmin)"
5,It's self defense!,"I am buying these 100 calorie snacks from Amazon in self defense, because not one of 5 grocery stores withing walking distance of my apartment in New York City carries them! I can buy the larger bag of the snaps on occasion, but today not one of those 5 stores even had those! I give up! Our apartments in NYC are small, but I'll find a way to store a 6-pack of the 100 calorie boxes. At least I will always have my favorite snack at my finger tips."
5,Too healthy for most people in my office,"Great buy but it seems that they are not very popular in my office (less healthy chip snacks are more popular) Still a great product, fresh and tastes like a pretzel should without any additives."
5,My husband loves it a LOT,I bought this for my husband. He absolutely loves it. This is now his favorite shirt to wear for jogging in the cold weather (the weather has been around 30-50 degF). He says the material breathes well and blocks the cold breeze and keeps him nice and warm without any sweat accumulation. He recently went online and bought another one of these shirts. I may actually get him another one for Christmas. :-) well worth the money! We highly recommend it!
5,Alexandra Slate: The improved Fiona. The new rock star.,"This CD is EXCELLENT! I just bought it a few days ago. Ever since hearing it on the ""Lara Croft, Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life"" soundtrack, I had to have it. It has many amazing, upbeat, slow, etc. tracks.1.) Bad Girl: 9.9/10. This song is extremely well done. The song from the TR soundtrack, a new sounding song that all will enjoy.2.) No Vacancy: 9.5/10: Another upbeat song. This song is a lot of fun, and has a lot of beat.3.) Edge of the girl: 10/10: My favorite song on the CD. This is because it goes from slow and intriguing, to fast, upbeat and FUN. Very catchy as well.4.) Guilty: 9.7/10: Another great song. Slow, yet intriguing.5 - 11.) All of these tracks are 9-10 star ranks. Slow, and fast tracks, fun and amazing songs....She sounds a bit like Fiona, only a polished, much better version.Buy this CD if you like Fiona Apple, or if you like talent.Rock on Alexandra."
3,NOT STRONG ENOUGH,Smells great but doesn't have the necessary hold for curly hair as it describes.I tried TIGI BEDHEAD and American crew. They are much better products
1,inshore sportfishing for redfish,This product has neither educational nor entertainment value ... it is an atrocious attempt at self promotion bereft of utility. It should be broadcast Saturday morning as a promotional product. I produce this 'review' to warn prospective buyers to look elsewhere.
5,Solid Music,"My 300M rocks with this live recording along with ""A Show of Hands"". I even have my ""R&B"" style wife rocking away to this CD set as she drives the car. It is great that this trio can present their studio work in such a solid fashion. As they were recording this collection, I was at ""The Palace of Auburn Hills"" shows, and the sound of their live concerts are certainly reflected here. Good work."
5,Rare Find,"This ""Rare Find"" is the best live CD ever recorded by any band. Long time Rush fans will love it. Seeing them live has always been a view for sure. Now they have captured their sound and style on disc. Pretty much the only CD that has really offered how unique these guy are. Excellent find."
5,This concert was RUSH at their finest-what talent!,"After seeing this tour 3 times, I must say that I have never been more impressed with this groups talents. I hope they continue to produce the magic that inspires so many people around the world."
3,Good Live Compilation for the Most Part (2 cd's or 3),"This is a 3 CD set not 2 discs as shown by Amazon. But actually the 2 dics shown are the best of the 3. Album has great song selections spanning much of their careers. The first 2 cds are awesome but the third left me disappointed. The album came in a cardboard case with the third cd loose and no pocket to put it. That isn't the only thing wrong with the third cd. It is recorded in London in 1978 and the recording quality is inferior than the rest of the album which is very polished live material from the 1990's. The fold out inside doesn't even mention disc three either. That whole CD must have been an afterthought. I'd give disc 1 & 2 a rating of 5 stars and disc 3 a rating of 2 at best for its lack of quality. If you buy this CD compilation knowing your only getting a quality 2 disc volume, it is worth owning as a fan of Rush. Just think of disc 3 like they did, an afterthought."
1,This album is terrible.,"Rush came highly recommended. But this album is the worst... I ever heard in my life. Especially ""Resist"" which could have been written and performed by Marvin Hamlisch. This album was completely unnecessary and the band should retire."
2,Save you money...,"This is the second worst Rush live album. First being AWAS. This is Rush's way of buying themselves time. Different Stages would have been perfect if it weren't for those annoying fans (Chicago) who constantly keep screaming comments as though Rush had come to see THEM perform. This disc proves how talented Rush is, but this is all recycled material. In '97, they released two compilation discs of their past material. The only ""difference"" with Different Stages is that you not only bring Rush ""live"" into your home, but you also invite the melodramtic/annoying fan who has to make sure he/she is heard. Too bad Geddy didn't edit those idiots out -- then it would have been a ""different stage."""
3,Pretty good.,"Different Stages is pretty cool. I don't listen to it much, but I still think it's respectable. Different Stages consists of three discs with plenty of live material. I prefer the second disc's material the most--it's very listenable and consistent. The album's liner notes are also really good. A nice job was done with them. ""Show Don't Tell,"" ""2112,"" and ""Analog Kid"" are some of the tunes that I like. One thing that disappoints me about Different Stages is that only one song is performed from Presto (that being ""Show Don't Tell""). I happen to like Presto and think that more than just one song should have been played live. ""Available Light"" and ""Presto"" would have been nice choices. It's too bad that Presto was virtually ignored. Different Stages still has some good moments, though. The performances are pretty tight and the live sound is cool. Worth a listen."
2,Great songs! Bad quality,"I've been a Rush fan for years and have loved every album (especially their live CDs), however, I felt pretty uneasy about this one. First the BAD NEWS: The production (I feel) is very poor. I think the guitars are too loud and not mixed in very well with the bass and percussion. It seems as though at times you can barely hear Geddy Lee's vocals (sometimes that's good though - just kidding!). Here's the GOOD NEWS: An excellent choice of songs!, especially ""Natural Science"", ""Bravado"", and ""Dreamline"". BOTTOM LINE: Great concert clips from over the years, bootleg quality."
1,don't bother,"If you have Exit... Stage Left and A Show Of Hands, then you have Different Stages. 80% of the songs that are on this title have already been released on previous live discs. Different Stages is simply a ""greatest hits live"" package."
2,It`s so sad that Rush sounds no more like Rush,"I remember the first time I listened a Rush`s song, and then when I listened it live; it sounds fabulous, so I always prefered live performances by Rush. The last expectacular one was ""A Show of Hands"". But this record lacks the intensity and musicality of clasical Rush. The third cd on the boxset, recorded in 1978, is more than enough to compare the radical and unfortunetely change in Rush live performances. It is really a big loss for rock live music."
3,Best Effort?,I love this band however the best part of this 3cd set is disc3 which has alot of their older stuff on it.
4,Great raw live Rush,"This is exactly how it sounds if you were to attend the show. I prefer these live cuts and recommend this ""box set""...Three discs in this set. The sound quality is really good and I recommend adding this release to your collection. This release seems to have an added energy missing in other live releases."
5,This is one of the best live albums ever..........,"When i first heard the CD's it was out of this world. All my favorite songs old and new were on this collection. I felt like they new exactly what i wanted to hear live. I highly recommend this 3 CD collection to ever RUSH fan out there. No matter what anybody says,RUSH is the greatest Rock band ever..........."
3,Average live album,"I have been a RUSH fan since 2112, and I saw the Test for Echo tour which was an excellent concert. However, I found this collection to lack emotion and intensity. It pales in comparison to ""A Show of Hands"". While the play list is longer, the presentation is flat. Geddy's vocals have none of their normal bite. This album demonstrates the reason I generally do not buy live recordings of popular music. Basically I feel that my $23 some-odd dollars could have been better spent. If you want to hear better live RUSH material, check out ""Exit Stage Left"" or ""A Show of Hands""."
2,Weak Impression of a Great Band.,"The songs for the most part lack intensity. The level of volume is too consistant throughout which kills the ""would be emotional"" transistions. Neil Peart definately lacks refinement in his ""new self invention"" (He didn't ""serve the songs"" well)-his only real ""bright"" spotlight being ""The Rhythm Method"". Geddy Lee sounds as if he has too much resposibility. Though his bass work sounded precise, the vocal and keyboards seemed poorly executed. Alex Lifeson was the only true highlight of the album having the best total control of his instrument. Worth mentioning is the ""Cluster Works"" software which makes an excellent screensaver (on Disk One). Though the album does its moments,they are not enough to merit the anticipation for its release. Some buyers might fair better if they purchase this album from a Used CD merchant."
5,An outstanding live album from one of Rocks premiere bands,"This live 3-CD compilation ranks among Rush's best efforts. ""Analog Kid"" and ""Dreamline"" really deliver. There are plenty of classic standbys here too- ""Closer to the Heart"", ""Limelight"", ""Tom Sawyer"" all showcase the Canadian trio in top form."
5,A Must Own - Simply Outstanding,"As a very long time Rush fan, I couldn't wait to own this CD and I was not disappointed. The song selection is terrific, the Hammersmith Odeon CD is a real treat and just, well, wow!I've seen the group 30+ time since 81 and own every CD. This set (discs 1 and 2, disc 3 is a bonus CD recorded in 1978) is such a high quality that it literally ""captures"" the feel and electricity of a Rush show. It is outstanding.Instead of just the usual applause you hear to start and finish a song on a live album, you can make out individual fans.Enjoy! I have again and again already!"
4,All hail the giant Tinkertoy!,"Although it has a few problems, this is easily the best live Rush album. More than half of the songs are either from albums written since the last live one, or they are old songs never-before released in live format. How can any fan resist a live set with the extended version of Bravado, the complete 2112, A Farewell to Kings, Analog Kid, and Natural Science?It sounds live, too (unlike A Show of Hands). This version of The Spirit of Radio, in particular, is full of the enthusiasm the band had back in the 1970s.The problems? Call it the Closer to the Heart Effect. Too many of these songs are on the previous live albums, played the same way. It's not just Closer to the Heart --- it's Tom Sawyer, YYZ, The Trees, Limelight, and By-Tor, too. These slots could be filled by so many better songs (especially the newer ones). It's not that Tom Sawyer is bad, it's just that we all want to hear the live version of, let's say, Open Secrets instead"
4,Rush works into a groove,"Yeah I know you have all heard it before but the great thing about this band is that they produce the goods live! The band has reached a point where it sounds like they are more groove orientated. Individually Alex is stretching give this guy enough room and he can produce some great giutar work. Geddy has developed one of the most pleasing bass tones and his playing goes without saying, definately one of the best players today. Neil is a machine and now a groove machine. There are some incredible tracks on this set, the first may be the best collection of songs heard in a long time."
5,Rush's Best Mixed Live Album,"I have listened to the CD from beginning to end several times now. I find it to be incredibly well mixed (as with all rush albums). There is amazing attention to detail, from capturing comments from audience members to maintaining the balance between vocals, guitars and drums. I love the lead into ""Driven"" from ""Lime Light"". I have seen Rush live many times and this albums captures their raw talent and dedication to their music. I have listened to Rush for a long time now, and I am especially pleased with their last three studio albums and this live album showcases this work. I am going to wear this one out."
4,Pure Brilliance,"As a recent convert to the Rush sound, I was very much looking forward to getting Diff Stages. I grew up listening to Kiss, Iron Maiden, Ozzy and I think the time had come for something a little more cerebral. And Rush have given me just that. Different Stages is a killer cd. The sound quality, as is the norm for Rush, is superb. The bands playing is flawless. I particularly like Geddy's bass playing. You have to keep in mind, while while he is playing some of the greatest bass riffs I have ever heard, he's singing as well. My best advice, if you're new to Rush, get this cd. It covers quite a large part of thier career and is a good starting point."
5,Rush Unleashed and Live,"If you're a Rush fan, or used to be but forgot about them for awhile, this would be the CD to buy to restore or refresh the relationship. These live songs move with their full energy, and with the technical brilliance that has made Rush so special among fans. This band has always played as tight in concert as humanly possible, and this collection will demonstrate what some Rush fans have known for this, their fourth decade together, that is, that they can still rip through their complex song structures like steel through hot butter.I'd also recommend Vapor Trails. Some of their most powerful music ever has returned in their latest compositions. The finely sharpened ""Secret Touch"" and ""Ghost Rider"" will leave you screaming for more."
3,Will Rush ever regain artistic edge of yesteryear?,"Unfortunately, Different Stages is not the CD that I was hoping for. As a long time Rush fan who cut his teeth on works such as ""Moving Pictures"", ""Signals"" etc., I can't help but miss the intellectually and emotionally stimulating lyrics and music in this new release. Nothing more here than re-hash. I can't help but feel that these individuals have entered into a contract contrary to their wishes for the direction of Rush and this latest CD is the result. Of course as a fan, I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt. I would have rather seen Neil, Geddy and Alex take five or six years to create a great CD and release nothing in the meantime than to see this latest live ""box set"" released. I regret that I cannot give this CD a good rating."
4,"Overall a good idea, but the sound quality kind of sucks.","No one will ever come close to topping Rush (well, Dream Theater comes close) and I was eagerly waiting for them to release another live cd. I must say, as a die-hard Rush fan, I was a little dissapointed with the weak production on disc 1 and 2 from the recent tour. A lot of the recent material on Different Stages, like Bravado and Animate starts to sound boring after a few minutes. Given better production, those songs could have sounded a little more powerful. A good thing about the first 2 discs is the live versions of old songs that don't appear on old live albums, like The Analog Kid, and Natural Science. Hopefully Rush will release a full-length live video (hopefully recorded at one show, not a handfull of different shows) and redeem themselves with the sound production. Personally, I choose my bootleg 3-cd set of Rush in Camden, N.J. in June 1997 over Different Stages. The raw production definitely beats the weak production."
3,Beware: Only 1 of the 3 disks are live !!,"Call me a purist, but I assume that when a band plays live they really play live, no tapes or midi tracks playing in the background. Almost all of the performances on the first 2 disks have just that.Oddly enough, the exception to that is on the third disk, a live show from 1978 (back when playing live means you had to work hard to show your musicianship and prove you can still sound good with what you have, without cheating). This one is excellent. I listen to this one over and over.OK, OK, the performances on the first 2 disks are pretty good. But I have to give only 1 star on the first 2 disks for breaking protocol, and 5 for the third."
4,Louis L'Amour to Go,My son and I enjoy listen to Louis L'Amour tapes and cds while we drive from city to city. These two titles are great audio drama which is excellently done. Sometimes we sit in the car after our arrival some place in order to finish listening to the drama. This was one time - good entertainment.
1,Very Disappointing,"Being a fan of Mongo Santamaria, I was disappointed to hear virtually all the positive elements of his music suppressed. The bottom line is this: a lot of awful music gets recorded by great artists. Record companies second-guessing popular tastes are at the root of this. Check out Afro Roots and Skins instead."
3,Good For One Viewing,"I enjoyed the trailer so much that I rented the DVD. Two stars for the film: The story held my interest to the end, just barely. By the time Zel freed the spirits, I was ready to call it a show. Four stars for Califone's soundtrack. I'd never heard them before. Now I'm a fan. Five stars for the spirit interviews included among the bonus features. I've watched these interviews several times with increasing admiration for the acting and the camerawork."
3,Lower your expectations,"Lower your expectations for dialog, effects, scenery, star power, strong performances, character development, etc. Imagine watching 12 angry men except that none of the ""actors"" have acting experience. As harsh as that sounds I liked the movie and recommend it. They should re-release it with subtitles."
3,Careful if you want unabridged,"Not until you look at the very very small print in the upper right corner of the back of the jewel case will you discover that this is an ABRIDGED version. Bad, really bad product presentation. I will approach any Naxos Audiobook product with a lot of caution."
2,Made in Mexico,"I was under the impression from the ad this was made in Germany, but its not. This product you will be buying is made in Mexico. If you are looking for the product ingredients that are made in Germany dont buy this item. If you are looking for Nivea Creme and the ingredients dont matter to you this is an excellent product. I also received excellent shipping speed from this seller."
5,M'bloom's work is a MUST HAVE for any middle level educator!,"As a middle level principal who has facilitated the transition from the traditional junior high school to an effective middle school in three different districts, I have found this book to be truly a treasure among all the scores of books that are out there. While I have invested hundreds dollars over the years to middle level material, I have found nothing better. It is highly practical, easy to understand, and gives the nuts and bolts details that many books omit. It has been a ""Bible"" for me and my teachers, serving as a great foundaton for effective professional development. I give it two thumbs up!"
3,I wanted more of an expositional approach,I like the thoroughness of the commentary but I found the running commentary made it easy to get lost in the trees without seeing the forest.
5,great product!,"The book we recieved was in excellent condition and it came promptly, just as the seller has said! Thank you for an accurate listing!"
4,An Enjoyable Read,"Funny and touching, these stories have a lot of heart. Reading this book feels like sitting down to a cup of coffee and a good friend with a story to tell."
1,disney watch,"This products did not work, and it was several months start to finish before I could get resolution to the problem. Think twice."
5,More than a toy! It's a practical tool for using the Artograph Prism Projector.,"This Table stand provides an Easy, convenient way to use the Artograph Prism Projector. I consider it a useful assessory -- not a toy. Using the table stand allows you to sit at a table comfortably and draw your image while enlarging the size to suit your needs. So much better than sitting of the floor trying to see your image at an angle!!! It would be better if it had a knob on the side to allow for adjusting the height of the stand closer to the table. Still ... A great product."
5,A great reference for quilters of all experience levels,"Beyers' color tips are right on target. Her recommendations for choosing dark, light, and accent fabrics for any quilt can truly result in gorgeous works of art. The book is written so that even a novice quilter can understand exactly what to do. There are many color examples and opportunities to practice the skills she teaches. Finally, the color chips inserted at the back of the book are great for planning any quilt, and can be cut out and carried along to the fabric store for precision selection."
5,"Challenging, but well worth it.","Excellent book on color theory, with lots of illustrations, exercises -- really stretches your mind and makes you see ""outside the box""."
4,individualized education,"This is education as it was meant to be. It tracks each childs progress individually and supplies appropriate content after the lesson progress is evaluated. My kids have fun with them in the car and any where else they need to ""wait"". I'm a homeschool mom who thinks this toy a wonder of the modern age!"
1,DON'T BOTHER!,The time and effort put into this leaplink would be better spent with your child. The cost of the downloads are unwarranted. Any of the original toys without the downloads are wonderful. The money spent of these download would buy several other wonderful educational toys.
1,"I like the idea, but my wallet doesn't!","Our family has loved our Turbo Twist Spelling and thought it would be fun to get the Turbo Twist Math and the Leaplink to add even more excitement...WRONG! The online set up was way too involved. Finally we were ready to go and then discovered that we couldnt tailor the math facts as we had hoped. On top of those dissapointments, we discovered that it would cost us to download! We paid enough for the products in the first place, the downloads should be free!!! Needless to say, my husband will be taking the Leaplink back to the store tomorrow! As for the Turbo Twist Math, well that's another review!"
3,Spelling Practice Made Fun & Easy,"We bought this before school last August and used it all school year for my daughter's 3rd grade spelling lists. It made it fun for her to study the words and she went from an 85% average on spelling to nearly 100%. I had a few problems with Leap Frog's website, but found the customer service generally helpful once we got it all set up (which took a couple of weeks). I never had to pay for any of the downloads; they were FREE! You can only use one link for one child though - a real bummer since I wanted to use it for spelling lists for my 3 gradeschoolers and didn't want to buy 2 more cartridges!"
5,The Pulitizer Prize Winning Masterpiece by Carl Sandburg,"To Whom It May Concern,I find these legendary volumes about Abraham Lincoln better than the reviews I have read over the decades. The two flaws I can find is that there is no bibliography nor are there any footnotes. Mr. Sandburg was blessed by living during the time when many of the participants of these tumultuous years were still alive. May God bless his perseverance."
2,Motorhead - 'God Save The Queen' (SPV) CD single,"You got to be kidding.A two-track CD single,off their 2000 'We Are Motorhead' release. The two songs you get here,the Sex Pistols cover ""God Save The Queen"" and ""One More F**king Time"", you ALREADY get on the 'We Are...' disc. I mean, what's the point? So FOR completists, it's almost not even worth mentioning. Oh, plus, it's WAY over-priced."
5,My kids LOVE it!,"This is a great book for little ones, especially if they love Veggie Tales as much as my kids do!"
1,Not worth the money,"For the price, you can get all the info in this book by searching free web sites. Not worth the money! I felt cheated."
1,Think again about buying this book!,"I read all the reviews written below before I bought this book. The reviews were mostly for the good, but was mistaken. I was first disappointed by the size of the book, and the print/design reminds me of reading a book from elementry school!Most of the information was common sense if you have done any type of web development. If you are clueless about the internet/web/intranet, this book might be a good start, but I would go elsewhere.But I did find it funny that the author was anti-microsoft, but I didn't buy the book for personal views."
1,Consider Your Options,"I was given this book as a gift and was overcharged. I would not recommend anyone reading this book. Reviewing the negative comments below, I found myself in total agreement, but rather than restating the obvious lackluster performance this book turns in, I'd like to help point the reader, you, in other directions. Purchase ""The Web Style Guide"" if you need a good introduction or look at it ""FOR FREE"" on the web, I personally recommend it to all of my clients. The list goes on, but you can also check out photo.net and useit.com for more good stuff."
1,I Wrote This Book - Do Not Buy it Under Any Circumstances!,This was a great book 10 years ago - but it is totally useless today - please don't waste your Money.James W. Candler(Author)
5,Great solution to mounting.,"Although they are sold for Grill Mounting, there are so many applications where these can be used.Useful item to have on hand."
5,Unknown author deserves an audience,"This book is very timely. Although it's an adventure story that tends to focus on plot rather than characterization--a rarity in itself--in my opinion the best part of the book is the comedic dialogue. This is one of the few books that really tries to give you a good time, make you laugh, and entertain you, rather than just get you to participate in the ridicule of someone or something. It's just a good-natured, well-constructed, fun book, which is exactly what it's trying to be--nothing more. The lack of literary pretension is refreshing for a first novel--especially a comic novel. I don't usually read very plot-heavy books--I'm a New Yorker type--but I liked this one."
5,Smoke some meat!,Product came as advertised. Great wood chunks. Great smoke flavor. Will happily order from them again.
2,Lowrance disappointment,I bought a 520c last year. It worked about 20 hours and GPS froze. Tech support says it's the antenna and I'm still waiting for Lowrance to send one. Warranty is supposed to cover it if I ever get it. Hold time for tech support is unacceptable and time it takes for replacement parts is ridiculous. No more Lowrance for me.
1,not as pictured,"Item that arrived was not as displayed in picture. No BL, instead the words Bud Light. Which is fine if that's what you want. The items are poorly packaged so the glasses touch each other. One of the glasses had shattered. This is not worth the price with the shipping cost and all the trouble of returning it and waiting for a refund."
3,"it all starts to go downhill,",Hi well to start i wasn't as wild about this season as the other two. It starts to go downhill at this one. But I loved the katie ka-booms. And the one where they make fun of Barney and the one where they're in a drive through with doctor scratchandsniff. And the one where Wakko's stuck in an elevator with scratchandsniff. Those where hillarious! Well the rest where pretty much duds. Well gotta go hope this was helpful disappointed animaniac fanimaniac Brooke.
3,"Great Cartoons, bad casing and not enough bonus features","I love the animaniacs, but Warner Brothers needs to understand that this is still there propperty and it needs to be treated with respect. Therefor, they need to fix the casing so we don't have the discs lying on top of each other otherwise the DVD might crack and break. Secondly Bonus features are scarce how about the feature length movie ""Wakko's Wish"" as a bonus?Overall, this collection is Sweet and Sour it's not bad, but you can see what could be done to make it better!"
5,Who's The Who?,"Abbott and Costello meets...WOODSTOCK!Slappy: Who's that group of the stage?Skippy: The Who!Slappy: The group on the stage!Skippy: The Who!...Also, remember when The Three Tenors (Domingo, Carras, and Pavoroti) played at the Dodger's Stadium? What would have happened if Slappy had promised Skippy a Dodger's game on that day? Slappy would do ANYTHING to keep that promise, even to the point of calling in the Mother Ship from ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind""!Then there are the Warners as Power Rangers?! (Remember them?) They didn't have to go very far to parody that show!Granted the show has some clinkers, but when the series was at it's very best, it was pricless."
2,bling blang,"It is differnetly not a ring you would want to show off it looks cheap, poorly made and it very light total weight."
3,"Dissapointing sound -- it tends toward a very ""tinny"" sound","I like the size and quality of workmanship on my unit; however, the sound was actually quite dissapointing. I don't generally like a lot of Bass sound, but this unit doesn't even have enough for me. Instruments come out sounding ""tinny"" and it gets even more annoying at higher volumes. There are no treble or bass controls (only volume). Voices come out crystal clear -- so it is great if you like listening to podcasts and such. If you are a classical of jazz lover -- this is NOT the unit for you."
2,No Nano Charging,"This is a very nicely designed product with good sound. It does not, however, support the latest Nano for charging. VERY inconvenient.I would look elsewhere for a dock."
4,Perfect for what it is,Compact and travel-friendly with great sound. Great for the price! I've had it for 2 years and it works just as well.
3,Not up to Polk quality,"I expected a much larger sounding product than I got. Yes, it's inexpensive, but I associate Polk with high quality sound, which this wasn't. Great safe packaging, great instructions, but I returned it."
4,GREAT Sound & Portable Too,My son is physically disabled and this compact/portable dock for his ipod is perfect for him to sit on his wheelchair tray and listen to his music. Has really good sound for such a small audio system. Folds up and goes into a carrying case for safe keeping and travel. Also can be used with batteries which makes it even more portable for our son. LOVE IT. Great deal for a great price.
2,"Small sound, no base but nice and portable","I received this as a gift for my baby's room. I wanted a small speaker system to play music from my ipod in my nursery. The item is nice and small and would travel really easy. It has a nice travel pouch, etc. The plug in the back started falling out day one and looked like it would easily get bent over time. The plug, which is jump rope length, wont fit into the travel bag. MAINLY....the problem is that the sound is like a very old clock radio that has had its speakers blown out. I don't even want to use it for the very small purpose I had planned. I ventured out to Frys today with my ipod and listened to several other small ipod docking speaker systems. There are SO many that have better sound, remotes, small size and other features like clock or AM/FM that I am returning this ASAP. Too bad Im going to be charged a restocking fee by the company amazon contracted through because the speakers are bad!"
5,solid product,"This is a good product. I searched for quite a while - this works great for the office. I have no problem w/ volume adjustment, which I was concerned about when I saw the simplicity of the controls on the unit. I love the portability and I also like that it charges my ipod. Convenient."
2,Like eating white bread,"Seemed like it could be an interesting saga. The stage set and characters showed great promise in the beginning. IMO it draaaaggggeed. Not much character development. No sense of the characters having feelings. For example after Livy's mother dies suddenly, her grief is expressed by sitting in the kitchen sullenly with her dog and cat. The book then just flows right into WW II and the changes in the household that come with the war. I kept waiting for Livy to have a conversation with Dena or Ginny about her feelings over the sudden loss of her only remaining parent. I read about 20 more pages after the mother died and nothing. I gave up on this book whose author can kill off a character so easily with the related characters being so unaffected. Not quality writing IMO. Just bland. Literally and figuratively put me to sleep. This is the 2nd Gaskin book that failed to hold my attention. I won't be trying any more. She's not the author for me."
5,looking for more copies,i have given this book to all the coaches of my sons' and daughter's teams as post season presents. they have all loved the book. i have several more coaches to go and i was wondering if the author or anybody else knew where to get them.
5,perfect addition to Tupac collection,"Beautiful photography. Not at all a cheap compilation that makes Tupac look like a ghetto gangster. His spirit is nicely conveyed, easy reading. I love that it's a hard-cover book. It would make a nice gift for the Tupac fan who doesn't have this book. The author(s) obviously put this together out of love and respect for the late artist."
3,It's ok,"I've read tons of tupac books, this one is really not a reader. It's more of a picture book with captions, if your looking for a book to further learn about tupac i wouldnt recommend it, however the pictures of him are phenomenal."
1,Thru My Eyes:Thoughts on Tupac Shakur in Pictues and Words,"I bought this book just to see what this book was about. This book should never been printed! Who puts out of focus photos in a book, has his lawyer put a review on this website raving about it and then sells it?! It's a disgrace to photography of any sort. This guy is just making money off 2Pac fans and laughing his way to the bank. You can download better stuff on the web. His storytelling is not fluid or sincere. Anyone can add made up stories to pictures. It's a joke!!!"
