1,Could Never Get It to Work On Windows ME Properly,"I have Windows ME and this printer absolutely gave me headaches. I couldn't print. The drivers hung my computer. I finally decided to return it. When HP says it supports ME, they should make sure that is the case."
2,A very slow process,After charging my credit card the printer was not sent. The seller said Amazon gave him the wrong address and the item was returned. The seller offered a refund and I accepted. After two or three emails the money was refunded. All is well that ends well.
5,Real shaman of the West is Poet of Consciousness,"Robert Moss's deep experience in the dreamscape is unlike any other shaman-writer in the West. As in all his books, this one shows the mark of a real shaman. In Dreamways of the Iroquois, Moss is more revealing about himself even than in his previous books. In spite of this personal tone, the book is scholarly at times. Interspersed with a retelling of the ancient myths of the Iroquois and Huron people, the children of Aataensic, is Moss'initiation by Island Woman, an Iroquois guide who leads him into the wisdom of her ancient people. One of the book's most potent message is that dreams reveal the real desires of the soul and should be honoured. There's little instruction here on how to work with dreams (one chapter does it) as the book is more of an exposé and a manifesto for the rebuilding of a dreaming society. I recommend all Moss's books to people interested in dreamwork as they are all very deep and rewarding."
5,Welcome to Dreamtime,"This is one of the greatest books I have ever read. I felt like I could truly connect to my dreams after finishing this book. Told from an interesting first hand impression, it is honest and refreshing giving a glimpse into Native beliefs."
2,Too Woo Woo for me!,"Got this to research Native American dream interpretations. It touches on that, or at least the writer's opinion of them. But it's pretty ""out there""."
4,Very Spiritual People,"I know both Maren and Joan and they are probably the most spirital people I know. I have often called Joan a ""twentieth century mystic"". This resource fills a wonderful place for those of us who use the lectionary and who believe that the Church should be more grounded in its spirituality. Thanks friends!"
3,Ensure Compatability,I have a 1989 Cevy Pickup with the 350 engine (5.7L). Before you install this coil ensure your electronic system can handle it. I installed the new coil and 15 minutes later I was calling a tow company. I fried the ignition module. The mechanic quickly replaced the module and I was off again. Driving down the interstate I was again on the side of the highway calling a tow truck. This time I fried the low end of the distributor along with the new ignition module. After buying a rebuilt distributor and the second ignition module I decided to replace the Accel Coil for the OEM coil.
1,5 weeks to deliver,"I would not recommend this cap to anyone. First I had to wait 5 weeks to get it, and when I finally got it, it was the wrong cap.I should have just gone to Lowe's for this product. ""My bad"""
2,"101,000 MasterClips","On April 19, 2010, I purchased Disc #1 of 9 and upon receiving the package, I discovered the disc is inoperable. There is nothing on the disc; yet I paid $18.79 and have been charged another $18.00, which I am requesting a refund upon returning the purchase. It is better to always buy new software; at least you have a warranty to rely on."
4,wedding party,"Bracelets are definitely chunky, very sparkly. I ordered for my wedding party gifts to go with their dresses. Although the clasp looks a little on the cheap side, I am very happy with them and look forward to giving them to my girls! I also ordered one for myself! I asked some people at work what they thought I paid, it averaged in the $150-$200 range. They look great!"
5,Definately Swarovski Crystal,"I purchased the Lavender Blue bracelet and earrings. Both are vibrantly colored, deep blues and purples. Certainly NOT colored glass. The sparkle and shine will convince you. Amazing at this price."
4,"Beautiful, sparkly bracelet!","I just love this bracelet! It's very sparkly and shiny - simply gorgeous! Plus my favorite color is purple, and this definitely has lots of lavender and purple beads. The blue and clear help give it a good 'texture' effect because all the colors go so well with one another. My only complaint is that there weren't more sizes available (only 7 & 1/2""). I could have used at least an 8"" bracelet, if not an 8 & 1/2"". I like to wear my bracelets big, and this one fits, but it's pretty snug. But that's really my issue, not an issue with the bracelet itself. Very impressive quality, a truly wonderful piece!"
5,Buy This Cookbook!,"I love everything about this cookbook and read it cover to cover. There are many vegetarian recipies and all the recepies can be made low fat with substitutions (for example, low fat sour cream instead of regular). The photos are beautiful and the writing is witty. You can try several of the recipies without expensive start-up costs and I made one right away with ingredients I had on hand. A delightful cookbook with great ideas I will be using for breakfast, lunch and dinner!"
3,"Pretty, But Disappointing","The photography is beautiful, but the title is misleading if you equate 'easy' with 'quick' or 'convenient'. This book has some wonderful recipes that would be great for a brunch or other planned get-together, but it is totally unsuited as a guide for your average take-along meal. Most of the wraps don't travel well, although they are good when eaten immediately after being made, and many of the recipes can be fairly time-consuming. The best recipes are in the breakfast section - if you have time to make them, the Apple Jack wraps are great for feeding a busy family as they rush out the door on a weekday morning. Hot oatmeal on the go!"
4,This is a great book that is fun to read and hard to stop,This is a fun book that keeps you guessing what is going to happen next. So if you enjoy reading books about Han Solo and his good friend chewie you will really enjoy reading this book it is great.
3,"Good, but","These work and are labeled well, so hooking them up to a new radio is easy. The one thing they are missing is the ground wire. As many of the radios in these cars have an on radio ground, but they use a spade connection, would it be so bad to have the male connector in the package so you don't have to go find one or clip the wire in the dash."
4,An Insightful View of a Gay Everyman and His World,"""The Seven Deadly Sins of Love"" is the second of Eric Orner's Eric Green comic books. This series shows the Eric Green, his friends, family, lovers, co-workers, and the gay and straight communities interacting in collections of short comic strips. Orner does an excellent job of depicting gay relationships, how gays feel about dealing with straights, and bringing out the inner conflicts that make gay life difficult. ""Sins"" shows development of the artwork and story from its predecessor, ""The Mostly Unfabulous Social Life of Ethan Green"", though continuing a strong presence of the Hat Sisters and Ethan's cat. The Ethan Green series is always good, though tending to improve both art, characters, and story as it goes on. This series is the funniest and most truthful comic depiction of gay male life anywhere. Highly recommended."
2,Bought elsewhere and I love it... cept it leaks.,"I bought this at a local retailer and loved the measuring lid and the built in strainer. For me, the place this shaker leaks is not the measuring jigger lid, it's where the lid fits onto the main body. It never seems to leak much - only 6 - 10 drops, but it still seems counter-intuitive to me. A friend of mine has used it and not noticed these issues, so perhaps it's just me. I am, however, looking for an alternative."
4,Highly functional,"While not the most singularly elegant shaker, it is highly functional, with a jigger measure in the cap with lines for 1/2 and 1 jigger, plus a 1 ounce measure. All fits well and tight."
1,Looks great...leaks bad,"I have to add to the ""leaks to the point of being useless"" reviews. It's not just a drop here or there either. It's too bad because it looks very nice."
2,Saveur 100 recommended,I purchased this OXO shaker based on the current review in the Saveru 100 and because of many other great products I own from OXO. The product leaks like several other cocktail shakers I already own. I was trying to eliminate the leaking problem I already have so I'm returning it. Too bad because otherwise it's a nice looking product and I like the double-walled feature. I would also say the jiggered lid is not very useful for any serious measuring since its only 1 ounces to the top.
1,Oxo Cocktail Shaker,"Very sleek looking design, that said, very poor manufacturing very very poor, the thing leaked and leaked and leaked. I tried to modify it (I have access to a workshop) and managed to get it to seal a little bit better. But this should not have been necessary. I gave it one star but really it should get 1/2 a star at best.I am a big fan of OXO products and buy them with my eyes closed, I should have reviewed this product because I now see that other people have had the same complaint."
3,Form Vs. Function,"I work as the bar manager for a restaurant in NYC. Recently I purchased four of these shiny little shakers because I thought they were visually appealing. Unfortunately, they leak all over the place, making a sticky mess in their wake.These certainly look sheik, but perhaps look elsewhere if you are looking for a high volume, truly functional bar accessory."
1,Leaks despite snug fit,"I have been so disappointed by this shaker that I'm giving it away and getting a Boston. The shaker itself appears to be very well made, the lid fits properly onto the base, and everything about it would indicate that it's fine- yet it leaks terribly. I don't know how you could possibly find out without trying it- and I have several times. I recommend that you save your receipts if you get one of these. I wish I had!"
1,Oxo missed this one,"I have many other Oxo products in my kitchen, so I thought that this would also be reliable. After using it and trying - to no avail - to keep from making a mess, I have to denounce this particular Oxo product. No matter how tightly my husband or I held the lid to the shaker, it leaked badly. It looks very sleek, and the cap with interior measurements was a very nice feature. However, those two aspects can't save it; I need it to shake cocktails and it only makes a mess!"
1,Good quality poor design. (not talking about leaking),"OK so mine dose not leak at all, the quality is great. My problem is that the top is the exact same size as a pint glass. A lot of times I like to shake drinks in a pint glass. With this shaker you can't. Great for drink UP but for drinks on the rocks it fails."
2,It leaks...,My number one quality in a shaker is that it doesn't leak. The OXO leaks and I am dissappointed in a brand that usually makes such good products. I used it once and returned it.
1,LEAKS WHEN SHAKEN!,"I bought this shaker and found that it leaks when shaken. I ended up returning it and bought a Boston shaker instead. The Boston shaker is simple to use and best of all, it never leaks!"
1,"Looks good, feels good -- just one problem...","I've had this shaker for about a year now, and much as I love the style and the feel of it - and Oxo products in general - this is one to avoid. I've been quite surprised at the reviews saying this thing leaks. I've had the exact opposite problem: after one or two uses, the top half of the shaker becomes virtually impossible to remove. And I mean impossible. Only by waiting several WEEKS have I been, on occasion, able to twist it off. The only thing I can figure is that atmospheric conditions need to be just right for the bloody thing to open. After a year of this I've finally given up. Save yourself the money and trouble and avoid this shaker. It's one Oxo design they just didn't get right."
4,good shaker,"My husband likes these shakers. We have 2 of them. The only problem we have is that if the lid gets mixed up with the other shaker, it leaks. So just be careful and make sure it is attached before shaking or pouring. If it's sealed down, it works great-no issues."
1,GARBAGE!,This shaker leaks! It leaks from where the top meets the body and it leaks from where the cap meats the top. It leaks worse than the shaker I already have. LOL! What a piece of junk.Does anyone make a good cocktail shaker that doesn't leak?
1,HERE IS THE TRUTH...,"Are you ready for this? ALL MARTIN SHAKERS LEAK! Expensive or cheap, they will all leak due to the fact that shakers are just there for show, not functionality. Here is an alternate solution: Get a sports bottle or small pitcher with a removable top and pouring spout. Add ice then pour the mix. Shake; then flip the pouring spout and pour without spilling a drop."
5,The Best,"This is the best cocktail shaker I have ever used... no leakage, cover removes easily, and my hands aren't numb after shaking! Fantastic product! LOVE IT!"
3,Readable introduction flawed by a terrible index.,"A readable, entertaining book, but by no means acomprehensive reference. The index isworld-class bad. Just try to figure out howto concatenate strings, convert integers to strings, or identify the logicaloperators in Java. This is definitelyJava decaf-style."
2,Not impressed...,"This book lacks detail. Rather than adequately cover many Java subjects in depth, the reader is referred to JDK documentation for detail (over and over again). I had to purchase some REAL books to learn the language. If one wants a BASIC overview of Java, Sun technologies, IT industry trivia, and computing humor, this is your book. If you are new to Java, seeking to really learn the language, and like material that provides a lot of examples, THIS IS NOT THAT BOOK. About the only thing that I find my copy useful for is collecting dust."
2,"OK as a language overview, NO value as a reference","If you are looking for a book to provide an introduction to the Java language and you have no specific programming goals then this book will serve your purpose. Once you begin to create software and move past creating basic class instances and try to make them do what you want, this book is no help."
1,"Personally, I think this book is awful","I've been a programmer/software engineer since the early '80's, and I've worked on PC's, minis, and mainframes using traditional languages, 4GL's, and numerous DBMS.I have recently landed a position where I need to learn JAVA. This book is ATROCIOUS. Disorganized, infused with humor that really isn't that funny, and a lot of excess verbal baggage that I personally don't have time for.I would have preferred a concise, logical text that gets right down to business, moves in linear fashion, and actually gets somewhere quickly. I don't have time to read this egomaniac author's BS - c'mon, buddy, get to the point and stop wasting my time.This book is definitely not for experienced programmers who want INFORMATION and sleeves-up instruction. Save your time and money and buy something else."
1,"Is it really ""Just Java""","I bought this book in anticipation of getting some java knowledge than getting into all other technologies and confuse myself. When I saw title ""Just Java"" I felt there is one book which gives me some Java concepts in the myriad of J2EE books.But what I got/saw is completely opposite. I have all the chapters in JDBC, XML , Web Services, Servlets which is not ""Just Java"".Also, I felt the OOPS concepts are explained difficultly.Simple concepts like Inheritance the author made it complex and used some Window or WarningWindow example which not only confusing but also readers wonder whether they have to read that before and come here.Concepts on 32 bit, 64 bit explanation. If the author want to commit and tell he shd have said some thing more detailed. But when he is explaining he shd have explained little more detailed.I dont suggest this book to who ever are looking for ""JUST JAVA"""
3,I've seen better,"I purchased this book because of the glowing reviews given by several readers. I didn't feel the author presented material with great clarity, nor did he choose particularly good code examples. He was, however, mildly amusing at times. I had to supplement the book with others, such as Bruce Eckel's 'Thinking In Java'"
1,Only Book I Ever Returned,"This is the only book of many I've purchased online which I went through all of the trouble to send back.After reading the java.io section, I found that it had practically no useful code examples and very skimpy coverage of the subject. Same thing mostly went for the Swing section. Both subjects were areas I actually needed some help on. I can't see how this book is good for any level of programmers."
3,Not what I expected.,"First: I still think it is a good book. BUT I wouldn't recommend it for the absolute beginner nor for that matter for the expert.Second: his humor is only evident at the end of the chapters, leaving you to try and muddle thru the rest of the VERY dry chapter. =(Third: I agree with a previous reviewer, PvDL has lost some of his enthusiasm for Java and possibly for writing.OH and fourth: if you're an experienced Java coder, this is probably NOT a book you need.So really that leaves the experienced programmer that is migrating to Java, or the experienced student that wishes to have a better idea of java than that which he can get from an introductionary book. =/3 stars. Definitely NOT his best."
5,Saint Catherine Laboure,Very well written life story of an amazing holy woman.The book states that the details of her life were carefully studied anddocumented before being accepted for print. I really appreciate a book that does not embellish the facts and looks for the truth in the history of an individual.
5,good box,got this to transport my tools back and forth to the race track. i bolted this onto the small tire trailer i towed behind my track car through all sorts of weather for years and had no problems. would get again if i needed too
2,Great concept - horrible lock/latch,"I have tried to use this box for my sleeping bags. The box is great - very tough. The major flaw is the center latch/lock. The latch is on the inside of the bin. If the bin is too full and something is pressing against the latch, the bin is very difficult or impossible to open. I wouldn't recommend this box until they fix the latch problem."
1,Wrong Drain Plug,"I was purchasing a CD for my Son. During the process I searched for TR4A's. That's a 1960's Triumph Sports Car. I found a Triumph Magnetic Drain Plug there which I am reviewing now. Although I thought I was receiving a TR4A drain plug (that's what I searched on), and the description indicated ""Triumph"", I purchased it. The drain plug did not fit a Triumph Sports Car, it fit a Triumph Motorcycle. I couldn't use it, nor affort to send it back. I wasn't pleased with the product or how it was portraied."
2,1 in 2,Just bought 2 of these drives and right out of the box one was dead. Doesn't inspire much confidence in the longevity of the other.
3,Good So Far,"Have for a month so far, works great so far, seems slow but its working. Copying my movies over to it. Some vibration from the case that is annoying."
1,"Outdated, didn't work","My computer has windows 7 and could not recognize this when I put it in the cardbus slot. And I don't mean just didn't recognize it, it didn't see it at all. I tried to find updated drivers to install for it, but nothing supporting windows 7 use. Apparently, D-Link stopped supporting this product, as seen on their own website. No more updates will be made for it. I suppose if you're still using vista or earlier, it may work okay."
5,"""it just works""","""It just works"" with my windows laptop. Drivers already included with XP; no need for downloads or CDs."
3,"Good , but not great.","This is not one of James' best by a long shot. A more somber work, probably more reflective of recent personal problems for the artist, but still relevant. The ""toned down"" production is also a departure from the more agressive tone of his earlier works. There are a few gems on the album (Double Hog Back Growler, It's Your World and the title track)that make it worth the purchase. James has pushed the bar so high with regard to blues songwriting and performing that even a solid work like this falls a bit short compared to earlier classics like ""Two Sides To Every Story"" or ""Do Not Disturb""."
2,For Die-hard Harman fans only,"I am a big fan of James Harman's, but was very dissappointed with Lonesome Moon Trance. It's not terrible, but it is nothing in comparison to some of his other albums such as Extra Napkins, Do Not Disturb, etc. There are few tracks on this CD that deliver that raucous, toe-tappin' roadhouse boogie attitude that we've come to love and expect from James. Many of the songs are painfully slow in tempo and the lyrics are pretty unimpressive."
3,not very useful,"I got this book just for my arch class. First, the price is good. but the book itself is very thin. it doesn't help with the course."
4,"Short and, mostly, sweet.","This is a very informative, short book. While he doesn't ignore periods entirely, O'Gormans approach is to concentrate on key architectural principles, primarily structural, and use buildings, or even simplified sketches, to illustrate them. The book would have been even better if the glossary at the end were expanded, and used some sketches: words are frequently far less useful than pictures in explaining a term. Also, I found O'Gormans introduction a bit forced and wordy. Conversely, the last few pages of the book, in which he hurriedly covers such topics as the importance of history and association in interpreting architectural work, were fascinating, but rushed."
3,O'Gorman is too old fashioned ...,"Although it is intended for a more amateur architectural audience, O'Gorman doesn't seem to encompass modern thinking into his book. He pretty much re-vamps Vitruvius' famous work into this contemporary style. However, with his contemporary writing, he doesn't bring in any contemporary ideas... He leaves post modernism and modernism out completely... He refers to Mies Van der Rohe, yet he wrongly references him. Mies wasn't concerned with utility, where as O'Gorman's main thesis is that architecture IS utilitarian. The book is a fast easy read however, and it's been interesting... and it WILL certainly help first year arch. students."
4,Love the Glove,"The PalmGlove Neoprene Case is attractive, slick, and fun. I feel completely safe storing my Palm Pilot in it - a waterproof, shockproof, cushy thing. Of course, it would've been nice if it could hold my checkbook so that I would truly have my whole world in that amazing little case, but the case is so compact my checkbook doesn't even fit. So that's a minus for me, but not a major one. Design wise, my only complaint is with the little stylus holder found in the crease of the case. It's kind of difficult to get the stylus in and out, and because of the way the palm pilot fits so snug in the casing it's even more of a pain to keep the stylus in the notch in the back of the pilot where it belongs. Otherwise, I think that the PalmGlove Neoprene Case is very cool looking and very cool feeling. it even smells good. I almost wanna eat it."
2,Did not protect my Palm well enough,"This case is an excellent idea to protect an expensive piece of electronics that unfortunately seldom survives a fall on a hard surface. This excellent Palm glove worked well for me until this past weekend when my Palm fell onto a shop floor and the screen was severly cracked. It fell flat on the floor, not even on a corner, which would normally be the most stressfull fall for the Palm. Two things: Firstly: I think Palm computing should look at designing more ruggedness into their products. This will be challenging to do to keep the size the same, but I am sure they will be able to do this! Secondly: Make the PalmGlove more protective so that my Palm could have survived this unfortunate incident. I am currently lost without it!"
1,DEFINITELY NOT FOR PALM VII!!!,When shopping for the Palm VII itself one of the major complaints with this product was the highly sensitive on/off button - this case will only make this more of a problem! You can hear it turn on before you even complete the zip around. This product may work for the Palm III which has the hard plastic flip cover but should not be used/sold for the Palm VII.
4,Reliable and stylish,"I got this orginally for my Palm III and since have upgraded to a Palm IIIc to put into it. It is certainly more snug around the IIIc because that is a little bit bigger than a standard III. (From other reviews on here I gather that the VII won't fit in it at all, so beware if you own a VII.)From the perspective of someone who has used it for a III and a IIIc I give this thumbs up. I don't use the velcro at all inside, but using it just to transport my Palm around I have been impressed. It has gotten wet but kept my Palm dry - it also has some basic shock absorption built in to cushion minor falls.Plus I have gotten multiple ""Cool! Where did you get that case?"" comments from geeks and ordinary people alike.So, I'm giving this a 4 for owners of Palm III models. The only reason I am not making it a 5 is the fact that Palm advertises this for Palm VII models too and it doesn't work for them - that is pretty cheap of them."
4,A good case for people on the move,"This particular case is helpful for those of us who stick our palms into our back packs or pockets and forget they're there. It's great in the rain, it's a wonderful protector, the only thing is it doesn't hold much. I suggest getting a small note pad and attaching it also on the inside. Always use the hard case in addition to this because the case has a tendency to accidentally turn the PDA on...and once your batteries die, there goes all your info."
1,Palm Neoprine Case,I bought this because it was a recommended accessory for my Palm VII. It is too small. You can hardly zipper it and when you try it turns the Palm on everytime. It's going back!
1,Not large enough for Palm VIIx,"Great case - however doesn't work for Palm VIIx, which doesn't even fit into the case. Also didn't work for my wife's Handspring Visor, which fit but was turned on everytime the case was zippered up."
3,tight fit,"The Palm VII is a snug fit. When the case is zipped, the seam on the ID/card holder presses against the appointment book button, activating the calendar, and putting a drain on the battery."
5,Great protection for PDAs,"I dropped my first PDA (Palm III) and cracked the glass. Cost to fix: ($$$)Bought a PlamGlove the first time I saw one and have dropped my Visor PDA once onto a concrete floor w/no damage. Don't do that deliberately, but with a well-padded acse you can relax about tossing it into a briefcase and bouncing it around a bit. Cheap insurance; good design with an elasticized stylus holder and a place for business cards. Adds a bit of bulk but that's not a problem unless you insist on carrying your PDA in the hip pocket of your tight jeans."
5,Buy one right now!,"This case for the Palm Pilot is very nice. Heavy, secure, construction. Interior leather and a place to put money and your drivers license. Much better than all of those other leather cases out there!"
2,Not impressed,"Stitching is loose, the leather seams have jagged edges, zipper does not close completely, all in all does not feel like a quality product. Worthy of its Made in China label. Maybe I got a lemon, maybe you will too."
3,beautiful but awkward,It's truly lovely to look at. But useful? No don't think so. Why? Awkward. Have to unzip to get to palm; zip back up to put palm away. Alot of zip/unzipping if you ask me. If you don't use your palm often it's nice but if it's an essential part of your life then it's aggravating to have to deal with this case.
4,reasonably well done,"I concur with most of the praise of other reviewers, though as someone who willingly chose a megashul I am probably a bit less dissatisfied with ordinary synagogues than they are. A caveat or two: (1) Schwarz seems to be writing for a distinctly ""new agey"" audience -- baby boomers, politically ultraliberal, oriented towards mysticism rather than learning. I suspect that many unaffilated Jews aren't the type of would-be congregant that Schwarz is most interested in. (2) I don't think Schwarz emphasizes education as much as I would have; certainly, I chose my shul partially because it seemed to have more educational opportunities than smaller ones (e.g. a study session after services on Saturday)."
1,"Nice Heater If you Want To Heat, I Mean Warm Up Your Closet","You can only feel the heat when you are about a foot away, otherwise you dont even notice a heater around. The fan, if you even want to call that, hhmmm. I think you get more power from a hand held battery operated fan. I give a 10 for the look, but its just plain useless. Lucky It has safety features because I didnt even notice it was on for a few days until I saw the red light on the back (power indicator). Look somewhere else if you are looking for a heater."
2,A Little Disappointed!,This book could have been better if the author would have spent more time on her two main characters and trying to get them together. What I really liked most about Eugenia was that she wasn't one of those great beauties that I usally read about but her fun-loving personality is what made her attractive. Sir Peter seemed a little weak to me I guess it's because he really didn't get his fair share of attention. I really don't see how they fell in love since they really didn't spend that much time together throughout the entire book. In my opinion I really think too much attention was being spent on the description of the scenery and other non-important character than on the main characters themselves. By the end of the book I got the feeling that it was written in a rush which is too bad because given a little more time on the two main characters (Eugenia and Sir Peter)it could have been a pretty good book.
3,Not her best,"I agree with the reviewer ""Tina""-- I, too, thought this story did not allow enough time for the hero and heroine to fully get to know one another, what they felt I could only describe as an infatuation, and not truly ""love"", therefore, not a very believable romance. Also, the first-half was well-written and promising, but the latter-half was rather hastily described and wrapped up; Granted it was a slim 167 pages book, but I have read Ms. Ley's other books, and I know she has the potential to offer a better job than this. But on the positive side, the writing was good and the language authentic for the period. My recommendation: Try her other books such as ""The sentimental Spy""."
1,Not worth buying. She blew it on this one.,"When I finished this book, I asked myself the following question: ""Why did she write this book?"" The only answer I could come up with was ""for the money.""Mercedes Lackey has always been for me an ""automatic buy"". Not any more.This book doesn't advance the story of the Mage Wars (or its aftermath). It doesn't tell us anything interesting about the characters from the rest of the series, and really doesn't even tell us anything new about the Valdemar ""Universe"".I wish I had not bought this book, and strongly suggest that you do not buy this book, either."
1,A Very Poor Showing,"Having read and enjoyed the first two books in the trilogy, I was really looking forward to the conclusion. I needn't have bothered. Somehow I got the feeling that Lackey was just churning this one out to get it done. It was very poorly written. My advice: get it from the library if you really want to read it. You'll be glad you didn't waste your money on this one."
3,"Not outstanding, but decent.","If you like Mercedes Lackey and if you like Amberdrake and Skandranon from the earlier books in this series, read this third one. Drake and Skan are in it, albeit briefly, and it's a good ""here's how the story ends"" type of book. Everybody needs closure, right? In fact, I guess it's safe to say that, really, if you've been reading a series ... you should probably continue right on through the last book. Did you really need someone to tell you that???The series is pretty much worth the read (*she typed grudgingly*) ... but the first book is the best - best characters/character development, best plot, etc. Don't expect the second two to be quite as good."
3,not as good as the other two,"i think that the characters are a bit too boring and quite unintersting. the plot is too contrived but i feel that the explosive ending is applaudable. it managed to make this book an okay read. i like that in the end, both children managed to set their differences aside and see who their fathers really are and that they indeed wanted the same thing the children wanted : acceptance. amberdrake is the most pained here, especially since his daughter blade seems to alienate herself from her parents, especially to amberdrake. it's really sad to see that he couldn't have a common ground with his own child, and him being a kestra'chern seems to make it worst. however all is solved at the end and it's the end that truly becomes the saving grace of this effort."
1,Bad,"If one is a fan of Mercedes Lackey's Valdemar series, ""The Silver Gryphon"" is helpful only insofar as you will be able to say that you own all of her books set in that world (barring the recent Owlflight books which seem to be merely another method of ""milking a long dry cow"" as it were). The characters are the ""scions"" of the previous two novels - and rather whiney characters at that. They spend their time lost in a jungle, afraid. The reader spends his or her time lost in the doldrums, bored. If one is an illustration flipper, like me, who tends to look at all the pictures before reading the plot, the ""magic eating creatures"" are already revealed. There are very few books that I cannot finish - this nearly became one of those (except that I had purchased it, I certainly would not have finished). If you enjoyed her Valdemar series thus far, if you read that series merely to puzzle out her world, then consider your puzzle complete and leave ""The Silver Gryphon"" on the shelves."
2,Not as good as the previous 2,"I didn't think this book was as good as Black or White Gryphon. Although I enjoyed reading about Tad and Blade, I would have much preffered to hear more about the Haighliegh empire, which got me interested in a line from Storm Warning ""The Eastern Empire expanded south until they hit an older, more established Empire"". Was that the Haighlei?Other than that, I thought the book moved too slowly, and I finished it in no time at all, but with a sense of feeling like I had only started.Oh the whole, not one of Misty's best efforts I'm afrai"
3,Faltering Hawk...,"I know that whoever reads this review will read the book no matter what I, or any others who have read it, say. To that person, the only thing I can say is that prepare for something lesser than your expectations. I love Mercedes Lackey and her works with unequaled passion(read my review of the set, Heralds of Valdimar). The problem is that this book had no vision, it is like a hawk diving into a forest searching for prey that it had not seen yet. To you, Mercedes, I would not believe for an instant that you wrote this for the money, but the series had an exceptable end in White Gryphon. I am deeply sorry for both you and all the readers out there. It hurts to be saying this, but there is no way around it. I will now retreat into the mental shell from whence I came and read the Mage Winds again.."
3,Meh,"While I love most of the Valdemar series, I found the Silver Gryphon to be somewhat lacking and annoying. While I realize that these are children born from famed parents, the book still takes on a somewhat annoying voice."
4,Much better than the reviews say,"After finishing this book I can only partly understand why folks are disapointed by this book. Yes it is more of a stand alone novel than a part 3, but really how much was there that needed to be said after book 2? Nothing that I could find, so this is a perfectly decent book with a nice suspenseful plot. It is, however, rushed and a bit sloppy in places.But my goodness moral depravity? Where on earth did that come from? There is nothing of the sort in this book, there is some pragmatic thoughts by characters because of the stubborness and bad decisions made by others that those characters could not prevent. But nothing to suggest such a term as moral depravity.To sum up it was a fun book with a nice and interesting plot. But I too would have liked another 50-100 pages of plot for a better ending...not just abruptly stopped as it was."
5,MUST read it!,"The Silver Gryphon is a really really great book, though you should read the other two before it. (the Black Gryphon and the White Gryphon). It goes into detail about my favorite things from the mercedes lackey books...wyrsa. ::shudders:: wouldnt want to meet some of those face-to-face! e mail me.."
4,Bad.,"I know I am being harsh, any of Lackey's books should get 5 stars, but this is lousy, the only thing they do is fight a pack of magic eating wrysa! If you buy the book, you need only read the first and last few chapters."
1,Vitola trys too hard. Great American novel is not here.,"I have read both Quantum and Opalite Moons and feel like I've been sufficiently mooned. I'm always interested in new talent and I applaud it. Vitola appears to be striving for an anthology, having thus far double-mooned us. Dare we speculate that her third offering will have ""Moon"" in the title? Thanks for the warning. Vitola strains to perfect ""cleverness"" in her characters and plots. She is preoccupied with creating unforgettable characters (in the eye of the beholder),than with the essence of good story-telling. I look for believability in her writing and cannot find any. Her work is quite immature, overly stated, taxing, boring, and I feel stupid for having read it. A good read provides information and entertainment. Poorly written texts are frequently good sellers. My wallet can take the price, but my brain can't take the lack lustre brain dump."
3,Maddslinky - Make Your Peace,"Broken beat as only Laws of Motion can deliver it: Maddslinky gets down with his debut, MAKE YOUR PEACE. ""The Story,"" for example, sets the soul vocals against some its solid beats. There's a general spareness to tracks like ""Future Chicano"" and ""Reasons"" as opposed to the jazzy layers that one normally expects from broken beat -- it's both a strength and a weakness, lending itself both to crispness and emptiness. But the fuller tracks, such as ""Mare D'Inverno,"" work just as well, if not better. ""Flute Salad"" starts off dark, but quickly moves into funk mode, while ""Desert Fog"" maintains its slightly mysterious vibe throughout. ""Sentience"" gets rumbly and sci-fi, but the title track returns everything back to the jazzy goodness that we know. If there's a weakness, it's the occasional weak vocal, such as the rap on ""Doing My Thing."" But, as the title suggests, I've made my peace with it."
4,"""Bohin Manor""","Although it took me a little while to gain interest in the characters, the book crept up on me and ended up being a good read. The story has it's romance, but the tragedy around the lives of the main characters is what really wraps you in. There were a couple of moments where I felt I was missing something in translation, but it didn't change the main elements of the story."
2,Adequate for testing,"After further review, I've changed my rating.I got this sample pack of Kodak paper free when I purchased my Canon i850 (which also came with a sample pack of the Canon Photo Paper Pro).The Kodak paper is not as good as the Photo Paper Pro. I've had the best success printing on it with the paper type set to Photo Paper Pro. The pictures printed on it are less glossy then those printed on the Photo Paper Pro and show banding. Also the paper seems to respond poorly to chnages in temperature and humidity.The paper itself is 1/2"" too long (4""x6.5"") which can leave a white border on one end if you don't adjust for it.I wouldn't buy this paper, but it's worth getting the free package to try for yourself."
2,Far inferior to Canon Photo Paper Pro,"My Canon S750 had come with 5 sheets of Canon Photo Paper Pro, which produced excellent, borderless photos. After depleting those five, I'd purchased a 75-pack (!) of this Kodak Ultima paper -- a complete mistake.As others have indicated, the paper is not actually 4x6, which is entirely misleading. Additionally, the ""gloss"" on this paper is nowhere near true-photo glossiness, as Canon's paper had been.When these 75 are gone (ugh), I'll stick to Canon."
1,Misleading Packaging,"If it says 4x6, isn't that what you should get! I wanted to make borderless prints on my Canon i850 and ended up with a white band on top. I thought my printer was having problems till I measured the kodak paper and found out that it was much bigger. Thinking I had got a bad batch, as nowhere on the package did it say 4x7, I e-mailed Kodak and they were not responsive. Luckily it is only paper. Imagine a higher priced item with such a neglect of information or bad service! Stick with the canon paper...."
5,A wonderful conlcusion to a wonderful series!,"I have just finished this book moments ago, and I must say, that this book left me satiated after reading the first two... which left me hungry for it ever since I finished them.The book follows the plot of the three remaining shards and their path to face their newest evil yet; as a few new faces join the crew, so do some old friends... and enemies.Shusterman's work was well thought out and well planned... not to mention well researched!Thank you Shusterman for giving us this delightful conclusion... with a surprising ending!"
3,A Sinceridad...,"Ciertamente en esta producción se puede escuchar notablemente que el Nano ya no es joven. Sin embargo, esto solo añade más consistencia a su voz. Siendo sincero, el problema está en el acompañamiento. Los arreglos no son para nada apropiados. Parece como si le hubieran entregado la responsabilidad a un recién graduado! Secundo a quien dijo que las canciones pierden la naturaleza de fuerza y belleza que tienen en su composición original. Se podía hacer algo mucho, mucho mejor.Esto no habría sucedido si hubieran trabajado con Michael Kamen o mejor aun, James Horner!"
2,SINFONICO ?,"Bien, convengamos que la grabación fue efectuada con una orquesta sinfónica, pero ocurre que los arreglos utilizados hacen perder fuerza a casi todos los temas. Entiendo que el problema radica en que ese puñado de canciones no son precisamente música sinfónica, por lo que las grabaciones originales tienen todo ese sentimiento que estas versiones en ningun momento consiguen. En cuanto a la voz de Serrat, el paso del tiempo se hace evidente, y este disco pone de manifiesto las cada vez mayores limitaciones de Serrat como vocalista.En verdad, siempre las tuvo, pero pasaban a un segundo plano como un detalle menor, ""escondidas"" tras temas espléndidos. Le doy dos estrellas unicamente por tratarse de Serrat con canciones suyas inolvidables en sus versiones originales, las que merecen el mayor de los respetos. Si este fuera el primer disco de Serrat que hubiera escuchado, me hubiese preguntado cómo pudo haber tenido tanta trascendencia y popularidad..."
1,Wet/Dry Junk,I had a remington wet/dry shaver for a long time and loved it. When I dropped it and it broke I wanted another. I got this model and it is just junk.You have to push the button in while moving the button up. If you try this in the shower it will not work because it is too slick.There is a flap in front of the first cutting blades so they are useless and on longer hairs they will not go in the screen.I tried it again this morning and I had to finish with my husbands shaver. It is going back!!! Don't buy this product.
1,Don't Buy If You Want To Actually Shave!,"Do not buy this thinking it will actually shave. Smooth and Silky should be false advertising. Not only is it not smooth, but I've used it 3 times and it has yet to even really shave at all. Very very disappointing considering Remington used to be a good brand. I have tried it wet and dry with no success whatsoever. What a waste of money!"
1,Horrible doesn't even deserve a star,"I owned a Remington for yrs I finally needed to upgrade so it was a no brainer to me to buy another Remington. I've used it a few times trying to give it the benefit of the doubt and maybe it just needed worked in a little. The little flap on the front prevents the cutters from cutting. Horrible. My old razor shaved a lot closer than this with ease, you need to repeat, repeat and repeat again and hopefully you've gotten it. Going to purchase a different razor tomorrow! Would not recommend!"
1,Worst razor I have ever bought.,"This is absolutely the worst women's razor I have ever bought. I really miss my previous razor that finally died, but it wasn't available here anymore.You would think that some company like Remington would care about their reputation more, but like that other lady said, you have to go over and over the same areas just to shave it. If that is their idea of ""hypoallergenic"" foil, then they are not considering that if you have to rub the same area a million times just to shave it that this is not good for ones sensitive skin. :-("
1,Belongs en la basura!,"I needed an electric shaver and bought this based on Amazon's rating of best-sellers. This is the first and last time I will buy based on Amazon's ratings. This shaver is really horrible because it doesn't shave at all! I have to run the shaver over and over the same spot just to cut that one pesky extra long hair. But I'll tell you what gets shaved, my skin! OUCH! This product is similar to using a dollar store manual razor to dry shave. WILL NOT be purchasing this ever again."
1,wish I'd read these reviews,"My teenage daughter dropped & broke the shaver I'd had for 13 years. I thought Remington would be good -- a company known for making razors. Wrong! We've had it for about 3 months. My daughter said it didn't work as well as the old one, but I'd read it takes awhile to get used to. She's used it plenty & asked to use a regular razor, something she's been very afraid to (and still is). I tried it & I see why! It DOES NOT CUT HAIR!! One review said it was because of the trimmer before the foils, but my old one had that & worked wonderfully. I thought ""they just don't make things like hey used to,"" but took a chance yesterday & bought a $10 Conair LWD1. What a difference! It works! Remington really messed up with this one, so I'll never buy that brand again! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
1,Never Again,This razor is terrible! I bought this on an impulse without doing research. Shame on me. It took FOREVER to shave my legs only for it to still leave hairs. I had to switch to a basic razor half way through. This is definitely going back.
1,do not buy,"I bought this product without looking at the reviews, I should have done that; This razor just does not do its job;no matter how you position it;There is no use buying it; My prior Remington was so great but I guess they do not do this model anymore"
1,TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED,"This was so bad I didn't even want to give it one star but I thought I better just so I could express my frustration. I try to be a very positive, optimistic person, but after purchasing two of these razors in the 3 week span and both ending up not working AT ALL, I quit. I went to another brand. I was able to turn my first one in and thought I'd try a second because I thought there is no way this would happen again. But sure enough, after using it about 5 times, I hit that button one morning and nothing. Sorry Remington...never again."
1,Spend your money elsewhere,"This product couldnt even do what it was designed to do; shave! It took well over two hours to shave below my knees and had to keep swiping the same spot over approximately 15-20 times before the hair was completely removed. Save your money and purchase another brand, Remington is no longer in the game."
1,Not as cool as it looks,"Okay got this thing as to put in my play toy and well first thing was that the internal amp did not work. Called PA and they told me to send it in and they would fix it.. Oh yea and send us $15 for shipping it... What,, yea they sent me a POS and I had to pay to ship it. Then I get the second one and the face motor was messed up and it would not give me the CD back. Another $15 to them and $8 for shipping and I get one that works when installed. The CD has to run via the DVD and makes it so you can not read the track number. You have to switch it to radio to change any of the sould settings. and the card reader is in a real bad spot. Also you have to have the remote to do almost all functions. Now I have had it in for about a mouth and the face moves when it wants to. I thought that for the money it would be something cool.. but it does not look as cool in person as it does on here. Well thats what I get for buy'n off brand.. Save your money and get something real."
3,A Mixed Bag of Early Tex Avery,"Released in 1991, this MGM/UA compilation of Tex Avery's Warner Brothers insanity should have been a slam dunk. Unfortunately, ""The Golden Age of Looney Tunes"" combines Avery gems such as ""Thugs With Dirty Mugs"" (1939) and ""Cross Country Detours"" (1940) with lesser efforts like ""The Crackpot Quail"" (1941). Since the out-of-print video includes seven cartoons, you're not exactly getting value for money. Making matters worse, Warner has consistently shortchanged Avery in its ""Golden Collection"" DVD sets. Animation aficionados deserve a more representative selection of Tex's early brilliance."
5,OUST SANITIZER,"Couldn't find the product anywhere. Went to Amazon and found it right away. I love the Outdoor scent and wanted to make sure I would have enough to hold me over for a while, so I bought a case."
4,Spode Christmas Tree punch bowl,We received the punch bowl and it was exactly as advertised. We used it many times over the Holidays and received many compliments about it. It is very substantial and I believe will hold up to much use and maybe some abuse as well. The only negative could be that some have said that it reminds them of an old fashioned wash bowl.
5,Great Crafts for Every Holiday!,"This is a fantastic book for parents,teachers, or anyone who likes to make crafts. Moms and teachers especially are always looking for ways to make crafts that don't cost much. This book shows you how to make really cute and original projects out of things we would recycle (or throw away!). I recommend it highly!"
3,orginal power rangers,"This is a good video because it has the 5 original power rangers. It centers on Trini's fear of heights, which she must overcome to save Billy from a putty."
3,great movie; terrible disc,"i loved these ballet numbers and cyd charisse was so gorgeous and delightful. and zizi was perfect as carmen and i loved cyrano. but the quality of the disc was absolutely horrible! blurry and skippy. i felt that i had purchased a rip-off video. so i give the movie 5 stars, and the quality of the disc one star, evening it out to about 3 stars i guess."
3,miserable disc quality --- beautiful dancing,"i can't believe how poor in quality this disc was. sometimes you can hardly make out any of the details. but the dancing is magnificent. and to see cyd charisse so young and glowing and absolutely gorgeous is a real treat. and cyrano was wonderful, as was carmen. i wasn't crazy about the first piece, but the rest are all worth it. i want to give this disc a five star rating for what it contains, but it is just such a miserable printing."
1,Synergy Archive edition of Black Tights (1962),"Great choreography by Roland Petit, but the poor quality of this Synergy Archive DVD ruined it for me -- everything is out of focus, like an old used VHS tape purchased at some thrift store. -- The Black Tights (1960)DVD is much,much better."
4,DVD quality of this wonderful movie ??,This is a WONDERFUL MOVIE. I am curious as to the visual and sound quality of this newly published DVD. The other issue was really not to the par and showed that it was copied from an imperfect VHS. I hope this DVD comes around better.
1,Black Tights,"Titles of ballets on this DVD looked very promising. Also, I wanted to see the art of Zizi which I never saw.However, the record is not interesting and even boring. Old choreography is not impressive in comparison with modern versions of all these ballets that we saw many times last 20 years, old record technique is not good, no dynamic, even the performance looks primitive sometimes. I'm pretty disappointed with this disk, despite Roland Petit dances himself in his 30th."
4,Niiice,"A well put together album, with excellent tracks. Great beats, well done music in general. I've been switching between the three CD's for 3 weeks now heh 8~). I would definitly recommend this album."
3,obtu(s)e,"i've had this cd since around the time it came out. there are only a handful of good songs, the rest is mediocre filler. this cd could've took the best songs from discs one and two, and combined them together in one disc. would've been much better. i listened to the non-stop continuos dj mix ""decoding jesus vs. dbas(s)ed)"" cd (disc 3) and it was interesting and boring at the same time. a tracklising would've made the experience a little better......so, in closing, disc one is better than disc two, and disc three is better than disc two, but not as good as disc one.....buy this cd only if you really like the hard-trance side of dance music.......oh, and one more thing: where do they find these artists at? they are billed as ""some of the worlds top producers"" but, yet, i've never heard of any of them....oh well. guess they are big in germany.......the best song is a tie between track4 on disc one, and track1 on disc two.en(j)oy>"
2,It does not fit all sizes,I do not agreed that this product suits all bust sizes. I read the review and I purchase it and realise that it was not the case. It will only fit from cup B onwards.
3,experience with cupcakes,if you're small like me and by that i mean nearly A cup then there is no point
1,Makes my boobs look odd,I got these to give me and little more cleavage with my everyday bras for when I wanted to wear a low cut shirt. The cleavage was alright but these made my boobs look misshapen! I'll stick with my full coverage bras-I'm a D cup anyway.
2,"Ok, It's cheap","When I hearcd from the Others, There made out of card board, I thought it was plastic, and duh, it's made 4 Mini-T, Not 4 Scooters, DUH!"
1,Total Waste of Money,"This is an arts & crafts idea book for teens and funky 20's. Aside from the standard inclusion for sewn tote bags, which are not worth the money to make anymore, the ideas are juvenile and lean towards the junky-shabby chic. If that's what you're looking for, this is the book for you to buy. You can make all kinds of vessels that are not functional. This is another major disappointment in purse-making books. Where is the purse book that combines great design with form and function?"
1,entry level purse making,I bought this book based on reviews which I now believe to have been misleading. This book is trash.
2,Disappointed,"I ordered this book because of it's 5-star rating. When it arrived, I found the purses to be more artsy/craftsy where I was expecting something upscale and designer-like. My fault, the cover photos should have given me a clue. Anyway, I was disappointed and ended up returning the book."
5,great books great service from amazone,"the books i ordered are fantastic ,great designs easy to follow and easy to make.the books arrived much faster then i thought they would which was a nice surprise."
5,Adorable animals and children who love them! Treasure these books,"This is one of many wonderful Judy Dunn books -- we first gotThe Little Kitten (Pictureback(R))and couldn't wait to find more. These are simple, sweet stories that accompany adorable, clear photography of children with their pets.If you've read a lot of books with your kids, you'll understand that not all are created equal. These are head and shoulders above MANY others -- No dorky rhymes, no annoying plots or stereotypes. My 3-6 year old children loved to ask questions about the kids in the pictures and learn about the animals gentle little adventures. These are precious little bits of sunshine on our bookshelf. Highly recommend."
4,Sweet book,I had this book as a little girland loved it! I am so excited to find it again so I can read it to my son!
2,pretentiously overcooked,"People who think this is a great samurai movie aren't dumb, just deluded. Mifune bought the story for himself, probably thinking he could equal Kurosawa's humanist insight. That's not shameful; but the story ain't that good. The buildup takes forever, and the main plot device is lame beyond belief. Film students will love this, but not real people. This is to samurai cinema as Shane is to Westerns, beautifully produced, over-earnest and bloated, larded with the cliches rather than the vigor of the genre."
2,average low budget police drama,a typical police yarn dealing with crooked cops drugs and drug lords.you can tell this film is low budget but it is watchable. some of the city footage is respectful but the movie suffers elsewhere.
1,HORRIBLE BOOTLEG HATED IT! REFUND,"If I was into bootlegs ,I could obtain better quality,as for like material regarding Noahs Arch,Forget it. llness in family,need return info, and expect credit. You guys should be ashamed of yourself. watch it.,"
1,garbage!,"The book had nothing to do with the down low brothers, it was some corner low budget movie. It sucks!"
1,On the Down N Low,I waste my money on this movie. I did not even finish watching it. It ended up in my trash bin. Not a good movie very bad acting.
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"This movie was so boring. I'm usually into independent films by African American film makers, but this was a H/A/M."
2,Flat,"Disappointing CD. I was hoping for a more robust interpretation of these songs. The way they are played, they all sound alike after the first couple of songs. The use of modern instruments is very distracting."
2,Better for Tall People,"Unless you are planning to play poker while sitting on bar stools, you will need to have a saw handy to shorten this oddly tall table. The table arrived looking like it had been diverted to a war torn country before landing on my doorstep, and it was no shock to find a wooden chip off of it on one side. What did surprise me though was an open box cutting razor left from the factory which nicked me when I reached in to pull out the pieces. Because of those things, I called Amazon.com and they knocked some off the price, so keep that in mind if you experience any of the same issues. The directions weren't terrible but could have been better. The only real positive I have is that the face of the table - the green matting - looks great. Note that it is a lot brighter than the display picture would indicate though. Those are just my warnings - for the price though, it might be worth the hassle."
3,Re-Living a personal history.,"Have not read the book yet, but have personal knowledge of this group before its demise in the summer of 1969 if I recall correctly.I got to travel a little with a couple of their organizers and must say, they were brave and they weren't afraid to stir things up.I am extremely glad history did not pass them(us) by and that their(my?) story is finally being told. Bravo!!!"
5,A Perfect Portrayal,"In Blue Jasmine, Kashmira Sheth poignantly describes the emotional turmiol a young immigrant must face. The title's allusion to a chimerical blue jasmine exemplifies the agitation Seema feels in attempting to return to her Indian roots yet adapting to life in a new environment. This book will take the reader on an spell-binding journey into the depths of Seema's mind. Pressured to stay by friends and family, Seema embarks upon a life-changing pilgramage."
4,amazing,"The book blue jasmine is a storyabout an indian girl who moves to the U.S with her family. Seema is the main charecter of the book she will learn things about the cultures of the U.S.A. Her world and the new world would come toghether, she misses her friends and the rest of the family who are in India.This book will give you many lessons about life its a compaling story about cultural misunderstanding, friends, and family.This book will always keep you happy, sad, and sometimes it will make u feel angry. I recomend this book because you will really love it, its a one of a kind book about cultures, family, and friendship."
5,Revolutionary approach!,"Daughter's review: Really great take on acting that will transform the way you think of the craft and perform. If you use the exercises properly, you will find you are becoming more complex in your characters and emotions. Highly recommended, but make sure to practice the exercises in front of other people or if not possible, in front of a camera to get the most depth out of the reading. Good luck!"
5,No Acting Please,"This is a great book for the Actor or any other person as for that matter.The book is filled with good philosophy for any individual: performing or just plain living and relating. The exercises are easily understood and very productive. I would recommend this book to any actor or individual that wants to connect with themselves and ""be real."""
3,Just Ok,"This book includes many drills, exercises, and games to help develop an actor's basic skills, but not much more than that. Don't expect anything on acting as you'd find in books by Uta Hagan, Stella Adler or Sanford Meisner. Even so, many of the drills and exercises can be helpful. The book goes into great depth on training sense memory."
3,It's okay ; ),"I read the whole book, but its kind of repetitive. I enjoyed some of the exercises in the book but the book was somewhat...annoying, I don't know how else to put it. It does have some good stuff in there, it just didn't sing to me...3 stars. -jj"
1,Terrible recording.,"I got this cd, because I was hoping to hear authentic sounds, but was clearly disappointed. Seems like it was recorded in the bathroom.The sounds you hear is like a faucet with a leak and trickling of water in the bathtub. Save your money and get something else."
2,"caution: NOT REMASTERD, a vinyl transfer instead","Ya gotta admire the ambition here. All three Dirty Tricks albums, nicely packaged, with original cover art and liner notes. Everything looks legit, down to the fine print, ""issued under license from Universal Music."" Well, they may have all the signatures and licenses, but they forgot to get the master tapes(!). All three discs seemed to be sourced from vinyl LPs. Even for a vinyl transfer the final product here is mediocre at best. Anomalies exist throughout the CDs, as if the source records were not cleaned. Also either the stylus was in poor condition, or the anti-skate setting on the turntable was was not adjusted properly with the tone arm weight. ""Fuzzy"" would be my best one word description of this set.Nothing against the actual music though. These Dirty Tricks albums are really great obscure 70s hard rock, and deserve a legit reissue with attention to quality mastering."
5,my boss thought it looked very expensive,and inquired about the cost. he was surprised when i told him i paid $30. good construction well made and looks good.
3,Pretty but not durable. Fun for the gentle kid!,I got this for my 3 year old. I bought it here on sale for about $10-and I wouldn't pay much more for it. Looks adorable but is not too strong! The item comes with 4 arches to hang things(a fairy) on but it can't take the weight of them!It can only continue to spin with 1 fairy on it. These arches are very easy to break so you must be sure they don't pull them down or out. Mine are still fine but I can see they would break easily.I is very tempting for them to pull on the fairy while it is spinning and that isn't good! As others mentioned it does make a lot of giggling noise when it runs but not more them most toys.The house itself has a door that is very hard for a child to operate and the area to play with the dolls is quite small and gets her aggravated . Overall I would say that it is better as a cute thing to look at in their room-maybe in a display of fairy dolls -than as a toy they play with.
3,Pixie Hollow Tree Playset,"This is really cute and my daughter loved it but, the first thing she did is place a different doll on the flying hook. Apparently it was too heavy because it got stuck and now it keeps sticking with the regular fairies on it. So, in other words, she broke it in the first hour of use. I don't think it was kid tested very well."
4,Delightful but a little cheesy on details,"The Disney fairies are very cute and it's inventive to have Tinkerbell living in a teapot. But little details like rather cheesy leaves on the tree that can be removed -- and then break at the stem -- should be reviewed by the manufacturer. Overall, a good buy and a delightful start to the Fairy world."
2,Pixie Hollow Home Tree Playset less than Magical,My daughter loves fairies. She is allowed to ask Santa for three gifts. This was item was top on her list. It is cute but fell apart immediately. The plastic extensions which are supposed to hold the fairies broke off constantly. If you put more than 2 fairies on the extensions (there is room for 4 fairies) the extensions stopped rotating. It was very frustrating for my 7 year old. Great idea but needs improvement in durability especially for the price.
2,Over priced,"It is really cute but the quality is low. My daughter ripped a wing off in the first hour and she isnt one that plays with her toys rough. Parts and pieces didnt fit well and and stay in place. The doll feels cheap. The only good thing about it is that she can use it to play with her Polly Pockets. I feel the cost is high due to the Disney name, Polly Pockets are a much better product for the price. This could have been a great item if the quality was better."
5,Super Delish,"This Olive Oil I discovered at a farmers market in San Fransico, and ever since then, it has been my most favorite. It tastes very olivey and fruity and doesn't have any weird smell or taste. in fact, this olive oil is delicious with just a piece of bread an nothing else. So of couse, using it on salads, bruchetta, anything you use olive oil for, this is the perfect one. I like that on the label it says when the olives were harvested and when it was bottled. I think that is a fancy touch."
2,overwhelmingly bitter,"I have to agree with the sizeable minority here that this olive oil is just too bitter (at least the Fall 08 bottling). The flavor starts a bit grassy, but then a flat, mouth-puckering astringency takes over. At first I hoped that the bitterness would mellow with a little shelf time, but after year in a cool, dark place the flavor is the same. I consider myself a foodie and I love strong flavors, but this oil's bitterness is just so strong that it overpowers any other qualities. I have tried a variety of premium olive oils from the California, Europe, and Australia and have never experienced such an unbalanced olive oil. Given the number of good reviews out there, I hope I just got a bad batch."
5,Bariani Olive Oil,"I gave this Oil to my son as a birthday gift. He said it is fantastic. Rich and flavorful. He wishes he could drink it. He uses it on salads, drizzels it on tomatoes and fresh mozzerella. Also, uses it as a dipping oil with bazil, chapatta or fresh Italian bread. It's HEAVEN!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Question If It Is Organic,"I received the olive oil and no where on the bottle does it say this product is organic, and obviously does not have the USDA/ORGANIC seal of approval.I went to their website but when I clicked on the various categories, even the ""CONTACT"" one, nothing came up on any of them.Contacted Amazon about there being no guarantee this is true organic olive oil and they gave me a full refund in less that 12 hours. Great service, as always!!!"
2,Bitter,"I was really disappointed in this product. Although the aroma is very nice, fresh and green smelling, there is a distinct bitterness in the flavor. This is not the peppery finish you find in good olive oil. I like the peppery finish. This is bitterness, plain and simple. I recommend that you tryBarbera Frantoia Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 33.8-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 2)instead. It has all the good attributes of the Bariani with none of the bad."
3,Comparatively slight bitter taste in a blind taste test,"I purchased this olive relying heavily on other reviews. Upon receiving it, I conducted a blind taste test, comparing this oil to Verolio Mediterranean extra virgin olive oil (specialty store purchase) and to Bertolli extra virgin olive oil (basic grocery store purchase). This oil certainly had more body and flavor as compared to the Bertolli and I would recommend it against that benchmark. However, when my wife and I compared it to the Verolio, we both found the flavor of the Bariani to be a little on the bitter side. When we're finished with this oil, I will purchase the Verolio again."
3,OK for Cooking,"We like a full flavored olive oil and this one sounded like it might fit the bill; however, it has a rather acidic, tangy taste we don't particularly like. In an pinch I've used it on salad and it was OK, but I wouldn't use it as a dipping oil. It's fine for cooking, but there are other less expensive olive oils that are also good for cooking."
3,"Not bad, but not as good as Apollo","I like robust olive oils with pronounced flavors. Although Bariani was good, it was a bit light with not enough green fruit. I prefer Apollo Olive Oil, which available here or directly from the producer."
2,Flavor or not,"I won't pretend to be an expert on olive oils; but I will attest to being a family cook and consumer of olive oils and this one did not strike me as quite what I was expecting. The first whiff gives a hint of stale and when blind-taste-tested in my home kitchen by my husband, my ten year old and me- dipping crusty sourdough bread-straight-up, no herbs, no garlic no other flavors- 2 out of 3 of us selected the OTHER first-cold-pressed, Virgin Olive Oil from Italy; we were trying to buy more American stuffs but will stick with our imported Italian olive oils for now. OK, for me, this one is fine for sauteeing- just not the best fresh flavor for dipping or dressings. In case it it matters substantially- the bottle indicates: 'Harvested Fall '07 and Bottled 6-21-08'"
2,Might not be to your liking,"After reading alot of favorable reviews here on Amazon, I decided to buy some early harvest Bariani from Fall 08.Overall, I was very turned off by the taste of this olive oil. I've tried quite a few olive oils (from low to high end) in my time and I've grown to like oils with a light grassy flavor with a bit of peppery punch. Perhaps it was due to the fact that Bariani uses unripe olives to make their oils but I found this one to be overly bitter. And it wasn't something that was subtle, I actually cringed a little bit on my first tasting. I will look elsewhere for my next bottle of olive oil."
4,Good but I prefer the Tuscan ones,"I like this olive oil because it has a distinct grassy taste, but it's not as good as the best Tuscan ones like the Badia A Coltibuono ones especially the Campo CortoCampo Corto 100% Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil 16.9 oz by Badia a Colitbuono, or Marfuga that you can buy from Williams Sonoma.I enjoyed Bariani's distinctive olive taste which is superior to most good olive oils that you can get for $20 at the supermarket, so I don't think Bariani is that bad but I agree with other reviewers that its aftertaste is bitter rather than peppery. I don't mind the bitterness because I think it adds character but I also like them peppery and this one is not peppery enough."
3,disappointing,"I discovered Bariani at my CSA during the 90s and remember it as a superior and tasty product. So I ordered a case (6 bottles) of 33.6 oz Bariani this fall 2010 and boy, was I disappointed!!! This oil has a BITTER finish. Sore throat bitter! I dont remember it being like this--this bitterness is memorable! Has the production changed? Does the oil get damaged by heat in a warehouse situation? First impression is pleasant but the flavor is soon replaced by an extreme bitterness.I'll use the Bariani for cooking and hope that Im not poisoning myself."
5,Bach Flower Remedy Book,I love this little book. It has information on the different flower remedies and the conditions that they are recommended for! I look upon it for information many times.
5,High rate of absorbency,"Finding good vitamins is tough. Grocery store brands all have a very low absorbency rate, like 2-6%. A study we found a few years back listed Source Naturals' Mega One multi vitamin to have a 96% absorbency rate. I couldn't find any other vitamin in the 90-100% range that was price any where near as affordable."
3,A wasted opportunity,"What an unique sound-stage for a live recording: a large stone church begun around 1300, present-day attempts to rebuild its crumbing apse have been abandoned; which only seems to contribute to the sonic delights emanating therein.But, for this listener, despite the all-star lineup, Live at Umbria Jazz, Vol II, is a one-track album. The track is Broken Wing which features a great intro by bassist Mark Egan, and then onto the Evans' greats George Adams, Tom 'Bones' Malone, Lew Soloff who carry it along for more than twenty minutes.Three of the remaining tunes center-around minor league (amidst this company) vocalizings by Urzula Dudziak and Delmar Brown."
1,"1 Handset already dead, noise, clicks, DO NOT BUY","1 handset already says Out of Range permanently. I swapped batteries, but it's the unit that is dead. At least I can go buy a new phone that is clear and doesn't click every few seconds. Really quite surprised at how bad this phone is...or shall I say was. Waste of money. Avoid this model for sure."
1,Terrible phones,"Click, click, click... Never stops clicking when talking on them. Can be heard from both ends. Bad Static. Poor range. Everything interfeeres with it. I will never buy another GE phone. I loved the look and feel. I like the features. But it's use is rediculious. And the batteries are always going dead. Avoid these phones."
3,Echos,"This phone has a very distinct echo effect to it.The battery is great, can leave off the charger for days w/o battery problems.I like the Caller ID view as well as the hold and paging capabilities."
1,G.E dual handset,"I wanted a dual handset cordless phone and since GE was the cheapest, I went ahead and purchased the phone. The phone was not at all what I expected. There was a constant hissing/clicking noice in the phone itself. The volume on the phone only goes to 4 unlike my other phone.I also noted that the caller id function did not present the numbers in the order that they called--the date/time function didn't work properly. If it was a repeat number it would go back to the oldest date that the person called on. Also when dialing long distance from the caller id, it would not automatically put 1 in front of the number before dialing. Also, the phone is not shoulder-friendly. If purchasing this phone I would indeed purchase a headset to go along with.I eventually returned the phone and was refunded my money. I think I will spend a little extra money in purchasing a product I have long trusted."
1,You will not get what you ordered!,"I ordered this phone and it is not the same phone described! Beware, the specs are not accurate."
5,Mandatory reading for couples,"This book is insightful, humorous, easy to read and understand. It is an essential book for libraries and a great gift idea for weddings. One critical part of the book talks about what happens to men if they don't express their feelings. This part is a little underemphasized because these repercussions (from not expressing emotions) are marriage threatening, addictive and destructive behaviors. There are other books that handle those topics I guess. However, I wish the author would have bolded or underlined this small section. It is easily missed. This is a book I will have on hand for gifts. It is a mandatory read!"
2,Not that Impressed by this Book,"I was hoping for something new and different, but this is the same old recycled stuff we've been hearing for years. I found Dr. Clarke to, at times, be extremely patronizing to his reading audience. Not every woman is a crowbar. Sometimes, unfortunately, there are 2 clams in a relationships which really leads to relationship problems. If you really want a good book on relationships, read some of the books by Florence Littauer and her husband. When my husband and I read their book, we found unique ideas and improved communication tools we could really use. Sorry, but for the more mature couple (50+ years old) this book didn't offer anything we haven't heard before."
1,Atrocious,"I was in the audience at the 2 hour long (it turned out to be 1 hour) ""workshop"" at the Fortean Times Unconvention in London, April 2003. The presentation, which forms the basis of Korff's book, was atrocious. Poor research was in abundance, selective use of evidence, and the author trying to excuse his poor theories by saying ""this is physics"". As a phycisist, I found this excuse to be pitiful."
4,Ugly but Durable and Functional,"After wrestling with the very poorly designed battery compartment door, I got the ID unit hooked up to my phone and answering machine. I called the phone company to tell them to subscribe me to caller ID service and they said it would take 'til the end of the day. But two hours later, when my husband phoned, the ID unit clearly displayed his name and number. I've had consistent good functioning ever since from this ugly (c'mon, why do so many electronics have to be made of *white plastic*?!) but durable unit. Multiple times I've even leaned over to erase logged calls while washing dishes, splashing water on this unit and it has taken the abuse and continued to function. I'm unsure it's worth the $9/month the phone company is charging me for caller ID service, but that is totally independent of the quality, ease of use and reliability of the unit itself."
5,Hard to find this!,"We finally came out of the dark ages and wanted caller ID for our existing phones, which we didn't want to change. This product allowed that and we really like it. And especially easy to view without grabbing your glasses. We bought one for each phone."
3,GE Caller ID Box,"Works fine especially for the price, except the call back to last number feature but that could be due to myself setting it up wrong. The LCD screen fades a bit, but for $15 who can complain."
3,display contrast could be better,"My only real complaint about this CID unit is the display. Don't be mislead by the picture of the display in the description of the item -- the actual display doesn't have the nice white background. Instead, the background is gray, which means the contrast is not so great. It's certainly usable, but must be viewed at the correct angle, under decent lighting conditions, to be clearly visible. This is only a caveat -- I kept the CID and regularly use it."
3,Doesn't last long,"I have had several of these units in the past couple of years. When they work, they work great. However, they fail frequently, often after only a few months of use. I have never had one last much over a year. Many of the problems are the same as some other reviewers have mentioned - unit says low batteries, but a change of battery either doesn't help or only for a short while; hard to change batteries; etc. My current problem is the call waiting function has stopped working, although the caller id for the first call is ok. Unfortunately, I cannot find another model that features the call waiting function."
3,No DSL,"The unit does not work with DSL. It displays Caller ID information when you are on the line with another caller, but does not display any Caller ID information when you are not on the line.When I called GE customer service about this problem, they informed me that the unit does not work with DSL."
4,Easy to Read Display,"This Caller ID Box is easy to use and has a nice display. It works exactly as stated. My only complaint is it claimed to be wall mountable in the description on Amazon. I have yet to figure out how to do that? I have limited counter space but plenty of wall space which is why ""wall mountable"" was a feature I was looking for when purchasing. I'm thinking I got some bad info there. If it had been wall mountable as stated in the specs I would have no problem giving it a 5-star rating."
5,GE caller ID,GE 29096GE1 Caller ID Box with Call Waiting Caller IDIt was purchased for my mother. The display is very large and the unit is easy to operate. I give it a five star rating. I ordered one for my mother and father-in-law.
4,works well and has nice features,"My wife wanted caller ID for her office phone due to a spate of recent hangups and because she sometimes could not clearly hear the the call back numbers people left on her answering machine. This item filled the bill perfectly. It has a large, easy to read display, saves and can display the last 70 numbers, and allows you to auto dial any of the displayed numbers with a press of the ""dial"" button. My wife is extremely pleased with the GE caller ID"
5,my caller id,I got it in good time. It was easy to turn on and works good. I really like the large display and how it fits near the phone. I truly recommend this product.
1,Battery Eater.,"I came to Amazon to replace this unit, and was surprised to see it on the top of the list when I searched for Caller ID. This thing runs on 3 AA batteries and it seems to like to eat them rather quickly. The unit is always on, showing the number of calls it has received. If there are no calls, it will display ""No Calls"".The Contrast control can be set to help, but often I've see it reset to it's default setting."
2,Almost quite costly...,"I've had one of these units for most of a year, and it has worked fine. Last week I had a strange issue with my phones working for outgoing calls, but on incoming calls we would hear a single ring, and then nothing. The caller would get that one ring and static, or just a busy signal.I had to have Embarq come out to look into this, and (long story short) he eventually traced it to this little GE unit, which apparently had a small, intermittent short. Luckily for me, the tech was kind, and reported that the problem was OUTside the house, otherwise this would have cost me upwards of $100.There seem to be no alternatives to this unit, so I suppose I will have to buy another one. Next time, however, if there are any problems with my phones, it is unplugged first!"
1,The GE Caller ID died prematurely,"This Caller ID died less than two years after I bought it. (I have several older ones that still work fine, but without Call Waiting ID.) In addition, it intermittently have stopped my phones from ringing - the only way I found this out was from another 1-star comment. On and off there have been messages on my voicemail service from the phone company; phone calls that I know never rang.Now I know and out went the Caller ID.Princesschecki"
1,Single factor failure,"Someone else correctly pointed out the inaccessible battery compartment. He had speculated that the problem was limited to the units produced in 2004. Not sure the problem is limited. Mine was purchased in 2007 (although may have been produced in 2004??). The cover for the batter compartment cannot be opened. Had I made any greater effort than I did, I would have broken the cover. Who approves the design of stuff like this, and why is there apparently no quality check before it gets out the door. Will never know how this item might have performed since I couldn't turn it on. Lost all interest after failure to insert batteries."
3,ge call box,"The gadget was in working order when it arrived. Battery life is short, and it does not work on phones that are part of a larger network (such as an office)unless that particular phone is a caller-ID enabled phone."
2,Low Function Even For Low Price,"The LCD is barely visible, except at a narrow range of angles. The battery compartment is hard to open, without a screw driver. Requires three AA batteries (absurd). And it's functionality is of the most extremely basic nature, even for the price point. I hate it. It was a waste of money."
1,Caller ID box,"Had a great deal of difficulty opening battery door.Since installing this unit, calls that come in have a great deal of static, for apx. 10 seconds. Same on messages left on answering machine. Have tried new cord, and batteries, but still same problem."
1,Just one problem.........,"When the unit runs out of battery power, it takes out the phone service on all phones in my home. Let me restate that. The phone to which it is connected, and two other phones to which it is not connected, all go dead. The first time this happened, it took me five minutes or so to isolate the problem. The second time it happened, I went right to the unit and disconnted it. Obviously, there won't be a third time."
3,Good but not for everyone,"When Gore is focused on something, like remembering his long lost love Jimmy or gossiping about the Kennedys this is a great read. When he is giving his thoughts and observations on history his writing also sparkles.His words on his mother are so bitter but I found it hilarious.When he tries very hard to explain locations and rattles off dates and names of people ony interesting to him this book is boring. I almost put it down but I am glad I didn't because towards the end some great dish awaits.I was touched by his longing for his lost love and he is humorous enough to forgive his high opinion of himself. (most of the time)"
5,An Amazing Life,"Jackie Kennedy's step-brother shares the story of his extraordinary life, from his first love at age 18, through the age of 39."
1,Why I couldn't finish this book,1. His ridiculous treatment of his own novels as serious literature. 2. His attempts at revenge (for WHAT?) against Truman Capote and others. (Methinks the lady doth protest too much.) 3. The disillusionment and depression I was experiencing at learning that someone whose wit and intelligence I had always admired is really lacking in both when it comes to writing about his own life.
1,Dry As Old Sticks,"How could anyone who lived such an interesting life write such a boring book? (...)It's like the only point of this memoir is to score points off his contemporaries. And in so doing, further puff up his already inflated ego.The guy clearly has no self-awareness whatsoever. Like are we supposed to admire him when he claims he is 100% top in bed and cares not a fig for his partner's satisfaction? Very admirable, Mr Vidal. What a prince amongst men!His ""life partner"" is referred to in passing approximately three times in the entire book and is otherwise notable by his absence. As are friends in general. Did Vidal have any? No, just famous acquaintances he could pick apart, if this memoirs is anything to go by.The structure of the book is as self-consciously clever-clever as is the title. A grab bag of memories scattered like cushions over the overstuffed horsehair sofa of the ultimate prissy literary queen."
1,Gore Vidal blew it this time!,I have always enjoyed Gore Vidal's humor and talent in his other books. I was however shocked by his total lack of sympathy for his own mother and even going so far as mentioning how a spoon played a role in how his siblings were fathered. I was so offended I took the book back and got my money back.This is a nasty little book. I did not even have the motivation to finish reading it! This book made me lose respect for an author who I always considered among the most enlightened ones.
3,"For as much as I like Gore Vidal works, I found this book a disapointing reading","As you would expect, this book is very well written, as anything else that Vidal writes. But if you are looking for an insightful book, this is not a book for you. His life has been, doubtless, an extraordinary life, from sitting at the opera as a child next to Mussolini to being connected through a stepfather to Jackie Kennedy-Onasis.At the end of the day, I found this to be an anecdotical as oposed as insightful autobiography, and it seems to me, the reason for this is his lack of emotional insight in his every day life. Nothing wrong with that, but is not something I like to read."
4,Life as a love/hate relationship,"The theme that seems to be clear in this memoir is that Vidal has a love/hate relationship with America, with the writing profession and with many of the human figures in his own life. This creates a complex reading experience where no story is told straight on and everything has a subtext. I loved this book because I love Vidal's historical fiction and his critical essays and comentaries. What I couldn't relate to in the book were those elements it has in common with some of his more imaginative (and in my mind less satisfying) fiction - a kind of gay over-the-top and in-your-face exaggeration that tries to make the ordinary world seem more horrible than it is because it isn't sufficiently 'interesting'. But then, that is Vidal, and the exaggeration and, yes, the hostility, is part of what makes his opinions always fresh and memorable - even when one thinks they are wrong."
2,The podium that he dug out.,"The first chapters were promising and readable: Vidal's craft nurturing the story of his early years. And then he called it a day. Disguising gossip as insight and desperately trying to build his mountain by digging around himself, not even his craft survived. Names, names, guest-list, names....a swirl of them and all ""exposed"" in their sexual musings, as if to prove an intimacy with an author who desperatly gathers the rays of the golden Fame they emit. Charming in its eagerness to shock. Provincial in its attempts to look patrician. Pathetic in many ways. Gore Vidal survives through wit and a void command of words. And this is unfortunate because one suspects that behind , somewhere, there is more to the court jester than just a defiant pose."
2,"Good hardware, poor software","While the video quality on the TV Wonder VE is fine, the software that comes with it often crashes, fails to initialize, or just doesn't work a great deal of the time -- often, trying to watch the TV requires you to reboot your computer."
4,Great quality and price,"Great running lure. Hits the target depth easily. Hooks are sharp and good quality as well.Only issue I have is with the split ring on the bill. IT's rather large, and a gap where it could possibly cut the line. I took precautions with a braided leader until I can find a better ring."
1,Beware - False Advertising!,"The project shipped is not the product advertised. The screen measures 12"" corner to corner, not 14"". The resolution is 800x600, not 1024x768. And the remote is cheap with just six buttons, not as pictured. The manual is printed on an 8.5x11 sheet of paper in very poor English, with no warranty or contact information."
4,It does what it is supposed to do for a great price,"I bought this along with some Forschner knives. So far, those knives have not needed sharpening. However, I pulled some old knives out of the drawer and this quickly and effortlessly improved the edge. The only drawback is that it does not include written instructions. I had to search around online to figure out exactly how to use it. Otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars."
4,Buyer Beware of Product Features Description,"The description of the product and the title is confusing due to conflicting descriptions. It is not a Black Fibrox handle as indicated. Even though the title says plastic, product description says Fibrox and since most of Victorinox's knives comes with a Fibrox handle one would assume the sharpening steel's handle as well. Unfortunately it's cheap light weight plastic, hence the 4 star. I can spend less and get a cheap plastic handle with the same quality steel from other companies."
4,Good product,"This rod is a grooved steel which will eventually turn your mirror like polish on your shun cutting edge into a micro-toothed mess after about 10 hones. I returned 2 shun classic knives thinking that the edges were defective on the knives. Turns out, it was the honing steel that was creating the problem. Buy a very fine ceramic rod to keep the edge on your mirror polished Shun classic blade in optimal condition. The Shun rod knocked the performance of my knife back a few grades, but the ceramic rod fixed all the wrongs. Remember to hone @ a 16 degree angle. Cheeers!!!!"
4,"Nice job, William","These are very nice miniature pieces for a composer who is something of a novice. Everything is nicely wrought and he makes fine use of counterpoint on his C minor Invention. I am a pianist and composer myself and can appreciate these little ""morceaux"" for what they are. ""Fantasies and Delusions"" is a self-depracating title and perhaps a pre-emptive strike on those critics who would think he takes himself too seriously as a maestro by doing this record. The complaints that it is ""derivitive"" -- really meaning anachronistic -- are a bit much. What did you expect, Stockhausen?"
4,He's always exposed us to tributes to the masters,"I deeply admire Billy Joel's overall musicianship and the way he has, on several of his albums, included snippets from the great composers that he must have studied during his formative years. Two such songs that come to mind are Lenningrad and This Night. I believe that he most likely consciously and quite deliberately has chosen to quote some of his favorite master works on this album. It doesn't surprise or irritate me at all - in fact, I was looking forward to it! As a first effort, this is a magnificent collection. Hey Billy, do you write for lyric mezzo sopranos? :)"
3,"Good, But Needs More Billy Joel","I love classical music. I love instrumentals. I was very interested in this album to see how the piano man pulled it off. Or did he?. The answer is yes. The music is lovely and very, very pretty. The only problem with this album is that it's hard to really call it a Billy Joel album. Sure he wrote the music, but he didn't play the music. Somebody named R. Hyang - Ki Joo did the piano. Huh?. Is anybody else confused by that?. Why would a world renowned piano player not play this new music that he made?. I cannot think of an explanation. That's why it's hard to really think of it as a Billy Joel album. Anyways, it was a very good effort from Mr. Joel. But I, for one, am still hoping that he returns to rock and roll. Come back Billy!,we need you!!!. More music!."
4,Lovely piece of wrting played very well,For all that say this is a hollow initation of past composers should remember that there has been little groundbreaking compsition for the last 50 years (maybe 100) and what is groundbreaking I can barely stand listening to. It is not Chopin .... it not supposed to be.Listen for what it is and you will find it lovely piece of wrting played very well.
4,Where's the score?,"So far, I've really enjoyed this particular recording, though I sure do wish I knew where to get the score (the music on paper). This is what happens when you have a Master's in music...makes you want to see it, not just hear it. If anyone knows, let me know! The music does have obvious influences of Chopin, but retains an individuality, which is refreshing. It also has some fun turns of phrase, which makes me want to see the music even more! Keep on writing absolute music, Billy Joel. I'll be listening - but on the next recording, make sure the publisher is listed. Thanks"
3,Well-crafted neo-romantic piano music,"When I heard Billy Joel had finally released his first classical music album, I rushed out to buy it. It happened to be playing in my local record store when I arrived. Good thing, because while the music is undeniably attractive and well-written, it is also rather undistinguished and generic-sounding. Tuneful, yet not particularly memorable. If you like this sort of thing (and many people will), by all means pick up this disk. You certainly will find it pleasant and listenable. I just wish it was a bit more adventurous. I look forward to Mr. Joel's future classical discs. Note: This really is ""classical"" (or rather ""romantic"" in the sense that it sounds as though it was composed in that era) music, not a pop/classical hybrid."
4,"Nice stuff, why complain","I like this album whether or not it deserves to fit into the ""classical"" music category. From a serious classical fans point of view, I suppose it has flaws, influenced strongly by former classical greats, but so what, that's how it's done. Few artist create without some influence of their culture and surrounding, both past and present.If we were musical critics back in the 1700 & 1800's, I'm sure there were plenty of people criticisng Chopin's latest release or Mozart's current opera.Maybe there's an expectation that a pop artist of this era should stick to his own music, which is wrong. I think this is a wonderful dab into the classical realm of music. In the interview with Charlie Rose, he mentions not having any expectations for this ""attempt"". He'd be happy if this album in some way influences people new to classical music to learn & appreciate it more."
2,Yawn . . .,"Jason Verlinde is wrong--Billy Joel's venture into classical music is not nearly as good as Paul McCartney's classical works, which, with the exception of ""Standing Stone,"" are well-constructed, have conflict and contrast, and have outstanding melodies and arrangements. Fantasies and Delusions is disappointing in that nothing on it actually goes anywhere. You could basically ""drop the needle"" anywhere on it and have no idea how it differs from anything else on it. The style reminds me more of a nondescript player piano. Joel is one for whom melodies and interesting ideas have always come easy, but perhaps his hiatus from his strength of creating great rock, pop, and ballads has dulled his abilities. In short, this CD is boring."
1,Stick To Rock Music!,"I love classical music. But this is an insult to Billy Joel's intelligence. What was he thinking? This album is slow, boring, and uninteresting. There is no life to it. It's obvious that a man like Billy Joel needed a break after all those years of good music. He has proven that he really was tired with this CD. He should take a long vacation and return with another... CD like River of Dreams or Storm Front. Personally, I don't think Billy Joel and classical music go together. My recommendations would be don't buy it. You'd be wasting your money."
2,Get real!,"I have another way of looking at this.If this music was actually written by Schumann and the other masters which are unmistakably being emulated within, nobody would give any of these pieces a second listen and they would have been discarded from the repertoire long before the rest of their very substantive works made it even to first base. Fantasies and delusions seems to suggest that Schumann et al had a really, really bad hair day.Unlike other superstar pop writters like Paul McCartney or Yanni who try to emulate the aura of the ""classical"" style in a generally nondescript free floating fashion, the thing about Joel is that the mimicry is just plain old way TOO contrived it becomes TOO obvious. I think it spoils and overshadows whatever real musical intentions Billy may have had had in writting these pieces in the first place."
4,Joel back to his roots....,"I have been waiting for this album for years. Ever since I first heard that he was planning on doing it. And now that I have it. I am truly impressed. I'm more of a baroque/early classical man myself, so Joel's Romantic music isn't my cup of tea exactly. However, his compositional prowess is astounding. I certainly hope that we see more of his classical work in the future.And to those who keep wondering why Joel didn't play on this recording. Joel said himself that he's not a classical musician, as far as playing goes, Mr. Joo handles Joel's compositions deftly. Kudos to both of them."
4,Very respectable piece of work,This is very handsome music. Billy Joel is the highest selling singer-songwriter of the Rock era for a reason. (He's the 3rd highest selling solo artist after Garth Brooks and Elvis) He has a tremendous melodic gift. It's put to outstanding use here. A bit rambling every now and then but that's to be expected of a novice. Hopefully there will be more and it will be even better.
1,Eighth grade stuff,"When I was in eighth grade, I thought of myself as a rising composer... in the style of Debussy, or Bach, or whomever I could copy. As an adult, it wouldn't occur to me to publish or record these exercises. Apparently, name recognition and advertising budgets can turn anyone into a composer. Doesn't Billy Joel (TM - yes he has actually trademarked his name) have any honest-to-goodness friends who could have stopped this? Richard Joo's performances were good enough not to make me throw the CD at the wall, but nothing could turn Billy's egomania into art."
1,Sounds like classical music,"Perhaps Billy Joel's regular fans will listen to this album and think that they've gotten all long-haired (in the classical sense) and sophisticated. After all, it sounds like classical music. It even looks like classical music. Okay, the Boosey and Hawkes parody cover IS clever. But it will invite comparison to real classical composers, like Chopin, and it's going to come up short. Way short.If it causes someone that's never heard any to listen to classical music, then it won't be a complete waste of whatever they make CD's out of. But the aptly titled ""Fantasies & Delusions"" (accent on the Delusions) is to classical music what Cats is to Broadway or Ronstadt is to Sarah Vaughn. Don't waste your money, buy some Chopin."
2,"Wide range of reviews, which should you believe?","After listening to Fantasies and Delusions, I decided to read through the customer reviews and I find the trend to ignore musical history very troubling. I feel a few posters did hit the nail on the head when they revealed that Mr Joel depends far too much on musical anachronism in these very disjointed sketchy works, but it is far more troubling seeing the number of people who go out of their way to praise him for doing this.Maybe you can favorably compare Billy Joel to Yanni because similarly he created pleasant sounding little nothings but I get the impression almost everyone is trying to endow him with the qualities of Beethoven or Schubert, a big joke in itself.No other would be immortal artist ever got a free pass. We shouldn't expect Billy Joel to get one either. And please don't be mad at me, I'm not being harsh, I'm just being fair."
3,"Good, but sorta generic","I have all of Billy Joel's CDs, but I'm gonna skip this one because it's a huge departure and I don't like it. Most of these songs are reminiscent of the Romantic period, especially of Chopin. A few tracks sound like Bach or Debussy. In the process, Billy Joel loses his uniqueness, and I could just go buy any classical record (for half the price) and hear it from the masters. The only new thing is the last track, which sounds like one of his sad songs without words, or a Keith Jarrett solo. If you really really love classical music, you should make your own decisions because I'm not a good judge of these things. But if you like Billy Joel, skip this one."
4,Very good but one question,"I've often known Billy could write solo piano material. There is a snipit of this type of material in a tune called ""Lullaby"", and after the verses. the middle part of which I believe was an incredible melodic interlude. These compositions are original, fresh, melodic...very good pieces of music.....BUT, please can someone tell me why Billy did not play them?.....He is an excellent player in his own right and probably no reason he could have not performed them."
5,Impressive!,"Honestly, I was a little afraid to order this item for two reasons: 1. I was thinking of the delicate blown-glass Christmas tree ornaments. 2. When I used the ""see larger view"" of the item Santa's eyes looked strange; like he was drugged or something. However, when I received this item I was surprised by how substantial this figurine is-it really is over 14"" tall and weighs over 7 lb. Also, Santa's eyes look normal; very happy. That just must have been a bad image or something on the ""larger view"" option. There are no dates or anything on this piece, so I am going to purchase some as gifts for next holiday. These appear to be very expensive pieces, anyone would be happy to receive one."
1,1955 all over again!!,"You Can't Talk to Me That Way!: Stopping Toxic Language In The Workplace"" is one of the worst books I have ever read. The author insults women by insisting that it is the responsibility of women to accept male verbal abuse,and in her mind rephrase the verbal abuse so she won't feel so insulted. Why not just bring the good 'ol boys and hold board meetings in the men's bathroom."
3,Great Music / Bad Quality,"I could have given this album a 5 stars based on the selection and interpretation of the songs, but the quality of the actual recording leaves a lot to be desired; the sound is dull and tarnished; I think the ""sound engineers"" are the ones to blame for this defect; they should stick to the known formulas for great-sounding albums; that ""Direct Stream Digital"" doesn't fly at all.And John should have picked up on that also."
1,Please give me a break !,"John Pizzarelli's voice is as annoying as the sound of a dentist's drill.It it so nasal and thin ! This Bossa Nova cd is ridiculous.No amount of masterful drumming from the great Paulo Braga can make up for the horrible lack of swing in Pizzarelli's guitar playing.He has no clue about Brazilian music and rhythm and I am sure that Brazilians must find this recording if not offensive, laughable and diminishing to the sensual and harmonically rich tradition which is called Bossa Nova. Please John, get out of your corny suit and loosen up your act. Also, please, remain with the music of your father. You might be better suited for it."
3,"Many Are Called, Few Are Chosen","Plenty of us North Americans love Brazilian music. That doesn't mean we can play it or sing it. I looked forward to hearing Ella Fitzgerald's ""Abraca Jobim"" album for years and when I finally bought it, I couldn't even listen to it all the way through. If I encountered this music at a coctail reception or something, I'd make a point of going over and telling the musicians what a fine job they were doing. But I expect more when the music is coming out of my speakers at home. Some of the songs are quite successful, like the Sondheim number which has such a sense of saudade that I had to check to see if it was a Brazilian tune or not. And Tom Jobim's grandson Daniel makes a tantalizingly brief appearance. Always nice to hear Paulo Braga behind the kit. But I can't remember the last time I've heard a worse version of ""Aguas De Marco"". Really makes me appreciate Mark Murphy and Sarah Vaughan's attempts at Brazilian Music."
5,Breezy Brazillian,I just came back from hearing Mr. Pizzarelli last night at the Ramshead tavern here in Annapolis and bought the cd after the show. WOW! It is an awesome cd. The Bossa Nova hasn't had it this good since Tom Jobim was around.(it translates nicley live BTW) The great Paolo Braga on drums and the addition of Daniel Jobim make this cd super special. A must have for fans of great music fantastically played!
2,Pleasant elevator music,"First let me say that I am a big fan of J.P. I've met and spoken with him, seen him perform live on a number of occasions and own most of his recorded work. This CD is a big waste of his talent. He's never been the greatest vocalist but his choice of material, arrangements and trio playing usually compensate. This CD relies on pop versions of several classic bossas. His take on ""Your smiling face"" with strings is about as pop as you can get without sitting in a dentist's office. If you liked Sergio Mendes and Brazil '66 you'll like this CD. Otherwise don't waste your money."
2,If Kenny Gee played guitar ...,"He'd sound like John Pizzarelli.My 78 year old uncle heard Pizzarelli do a 'Brazilian' bossa nova jazz concert in Salt Lake City and thought that I would like this album. Thanks, Uncle Louie, thanks. Even though J.P. is quite proficient technically, this album is just too cutsey for my taste. I'll stick to the real thing a la Juan Carlos Jobim, Joao Gilberto, et al. Schmultz!"
2,Mouse trap too complicated,"The trap is far too complicated and the instructions might as well be in Chinese. A big disappointment. We have had humane traps that were much easier to use. The complexity of this one, and its bulky size, are big drawbacks."
1,"poor design, too hard to set,, too easy to fail","Three times our little mouse friend got away with the special mouse feast we set out for him. Three times the doors on the Havahart Mouse Trap failed to latch properly, so each time he got away. On the third try, I actually had my hands on the trap, but I wasn't fast enough to push the latches (little metal rods) down into the catches.I give this product E- for effort, that's almost an F for failure.Only buy this if you have a heart, and are low on brains."
4,caught loads of mice but hard to use,"i caught multiple mice daily with this trap, but found it really difficult to set and to clean. eventually one of the bars that holds the door open got bent and it didn't wokr anymore, still, it works better than anythingg else i've tried."
5,"Elegant Exposition of the Group theory, automata relationshi",Word Processing in Groups provides a thorough yet complete exposition on the relationship between finite state automata and Group theory.
3,Above Average Holiday Horror,"Silent Night, Bloody Night is a low budget 1973 Horror Thriller. It is one of the first films of the slasher genre. Filmed before Black Christmas and Halloween it set the foundation for the following films and is really the first Holiday Slasher.Plot: New England. The story surrounds a family by the name of the Butler's. One of the family members was found dead there, burned to death, many years ago. Deemed accidental. 20 Years later, one of the family members returns as the house is being sold. There's an ax killer inside the house and a mystery.There's an ambiance and surrealistic quality about this film. It had good atmosphere. It is super low budget and the sound quality and picture are both terrible yet the plot wasn't completely bad.You can take it or leave it. It was a decent movie.Comes with interactive menus, scene selection and region free."
1,Very Dissappointing.,"I love horror movies, but the bad acting and the cheap low budget type feeling I got watching it made me turn it off after about 30 minutes of watching it. It was really bad. I wouldn't even pass this one off to someone for free. It was just bad. I would not recommend it at all and I'm a huge horror fan. Sorry, just being honest."
3,Refreshingly different,"Yamamotoyama's Unsweetened Iced Green Tea is unlike any green tea that I've tasted. This isn't a brewed tea, but a powder that is dissolved in cold (and preferably filtered) water. The resulting light taste and aroma is that of fresh tea leaves."
2,Shortened Version of the King Bisquit Flower Hour show from 1992,"This compact disc can usually be found for $7 to $8 bucks. It is yet another version of the original KBFH show released in 1992. This version actually drops two tracks, from the original 12, to only 10. I'm sure the sound quality is no different. Besides, with the bad vocals on this (according every other review) I would not waste my time on it."
2,A pedagogical embarrassment,"An earnest young man sits in front of each Logic instrument and points with his mouse to the onscreen buttons and sliders, naming them, fiddling with them, but explaining almost nothing. His treatment of Sculpture is especially and mind-bogglingly poor, as he flails around the various sections tweaking but never elucidating the mutually-entangled parameters and punching his keyboard. The most he can say for most aspects of most instruments is that they're ""really powerful"" or ""really cool,"" but he gives not a clue about how the sounds might be used together to make something coherent.Effective teaching this is definitely not. If, hoping for insight into Logics' instruments' complexities, you spend your money on this, I hope you don't end up, as I have, entirely regretting it."
2,Coffee table book vs guide,I should have realized when I saw the front cover that this is more a coffee table book showing the author's adventure than a detailed guide for others to follow. It appears that all of the roads are paved and can easily be passed by most automobiles. Not at all for 4WD adventures and no 4x4 trails to be found. Only the pictures historic references got it to be more than one star.
5,A must-have for industial design students and illustrators,"Syd Mead sometimes calls himself a ""futureist"" and his credits in the sci-fi classic Blade Runner read ""Visual Specialist"". This is an amazing collection of Syd Mead's visual art of the future and is not only beautiful to look at but is an intelligent view of future machinary and cuture."
5,Excellent Presentation!!,This was a great book! The presentation and abundance of prints is excellent. I have been playing with decoupage for some time and I found that this book has inspired me to do more and more. I found the collection of prints very helpful in both planning and enticing new projects out of me. The variety of prints and the clear and precise information would be helpful to anyone working in decoupage or just beginning.This author has really given me the additional boost I needed! Thanks Dee for a great book and your good work. I look forward to more!Allen
5,AWESOME,I live about 95 mles from Gulf Breeze and did not know about all of the UFO sightings until I read the book.Ed Walters is the man along with others that have brought the Gulf Breeze UFO'S to the mainstream. This book has some excellent photographs of the alien spaceships that have been seen over Gulf Breeze.This book reminds me of the X-Files books not because of UFO's but because this book keeps you on the edge of your seat.If you are in to aliens and other X-File type books get this one because it has alot of intresting pictures and diagrams illustrated by the author. Some of the information in this book was also mentioned on the X-Files TV show along time ago.
3,Gets Better,"I don't understand why everone is complaining about the lack of complexity in the beats (or why everyone has to talk like they're from the 'hood). DJ's are supposed to supplement the artist. If all you wanted was a mix tape, why not pick up some Mixmaster Mike or DJ Shadow? Clue shows remarkable restraint on this album, and what he puts together enhances the artists who appear. This isn't destined to be a classic, but I find it in my CD player more often than a lot of albums I'd rate higher. Very listenable."
3,Could Be Better,"I think that The Professional is a good cd for ONE reason, and thats because its got some hot artists on it. Some of the songs on this cd are great while others are about as boring as they could possibly get, but thats not why i only gave it 3 stars. i gave it 3 stars cuz DJ Clue doesn't do a single thing with the songs on this cd except say his name right when someones rappin. He doesn't do anything else. Nothing with the beats, nothing with the lyrics, nothing else possible. I doubt he even helped to think up the lyrics. I hope his upcoming cd is better than this."
1,Some songs with great beats but no DJ'ing?,"Well, DJ Clue is one lousy DJ. He doesn't make his own beats like DJ Primo who is the total antithesis and clue's ego is quite irritating when he starts yelling over the tracks in total reverberation. I don't usually diss DJ's but DJ Clue only redemption is his ability to bring together a community of solid artists."
2,Turntablism At Its Worst,"It seems as though many of today's DJ's are too afraid to scratch or experiment. DJ Clue is one of them. He has claimed that he was never into scratching, just the blending of R&B and rap. That statement is right up there with Puff Daddy's ""I'm not a rapper, I'm an entertainer."" quote. On this album, all we here from Clue are tired beats and annoying shout outs. The beats are nothing innovative, just some old song or sample put over a drum track. Little or no scratching is heard. Perhaps due to his lack of skills on the turntable, Clue has a guest MC or crew on every track. We have to suffer through weak rhymes by overrated talents such as DMX, Cam'ron, Mase, Missy Elliot, etc. DJ Shadow has successfully pulled off blending samples unlike DJ Clue who drops boring beats. Thankfully, there are real turntalbists such as Rob Swift, Mista Sinista, DJ Shadow, etc. While some of the beats are catchy, they don't save this album from its many flaws."
2,Rock-a-fella has let me down...,"I can't belive I got this crap. I expected rugged beats like the DMX track, but most of it is sluggish. If DJ Clue would stop yelling out his name on every track in a very annoying amplified voice, and use crappy beats along w/ great rhymes, this would be one of the greatest albums of all time. I don't care if this guy was responsible for bringing todays stars into the limelight, he SUCKS!!!"
4,Professional,"Long regarded as one of the illest mixtape DJs out there, Clummanti (a.k.a. DJ Clue) has been known for introducing several big-name artists a year or so before their albums debut.His mixtape line This Is It Vols. 1 & 2 has been selling out in mom-and-pop stores all over the nation and around the world.Now the great mixtape DJ has come out with a compilation on a major label. Unlike many DJs who make albums on major labels, The Professional includes all-new cuts rather than a mixture of some new songs with old favorites.With some of the hottest artists in the New York hip-hop scene putting in work for him, Clue has come up with several standouts: DMX's ""It's On;"" EPMD's ""It's My Thang 99"" with Redman and Keith Murray; and Cam'Ron, Noreaga, Big Pun and Canibus's ""Fantastic 4.""There's almost 20 new New York hip-hop cuts on The Professional, so if you can deal with Clue screaming on nearly each of them, you should pick this up."
2,He needs to learn to use the Turntable,"OK I bought this album because it was suppose to showcase a DJ. Unfortunately we get weak mixing and terrible shoutouts. Dont get me wrong, I felt DMX and everyone else, but a ""DJ"" needs to mix, scratch, and carry the beats. If you want some real skills displayed on the turntable turn to Qbert, Rob Swift, Eddie Def, or Signify. Bring those discs to the forefront."
1,EXCLUSIVE!,"EXCLUSIVE!I bought this CD thinking that i was going to get a great hip hop mix. I was amazed at the number of great songs listed in the back. When i put the CD in I almost died! The songs aren't mixed together well at all, his voice is dubbed over at a higher level than the music, and he claims that the songs are ""EXCLUSIVE!""The only thing that is exclusive about this CD is his RIDICULOUS voice, and his naieve mentality about being the best DJ in the world..."
5,Dj Clue is Worthy of 5 stars,"Dj Clue rips it up making a cd as great, with boomn' tracks like ruff ryders, and speical guests like DMX, Jay Z, and others."
2,"Clue made phat beats, but raps were wack","Yo! I hear DJ Clue every Monday night on the radio. This album was wack to what he puts on. He's got a track wit Nicole, Missy and Mocha where they be rhymin kicks ass but they aint on da beat. Then he got a Jay-Z track wit Jah where Jay be just talkin and Jah saved him. The two best songs are definitely ruff ryders and it's on. Most of da beats are phat and that's where I give Clue credit."
2,The beats are nothing new,"Clue has brought many tight beats in the past but the beats on "" The Profesonal "" are nothing to new. "" Fantasic Four "" is the tightest track on the hyped up soundtrack for the streets."
1,This CD is not worth the CD it's burned on.,This CD is barley worth listening to. Only white wanna be hip-hop heads would think this album is dope.
5,Can't wait for more!,"Julie Roberts has an amazing voice... the single ""Break Down Here"" is a classic country song...but also a great song about a very strong woman. I can't wait to hear more from her!"
2,Air Hogs E-Charges,I was not very happy with this product. I guess you get what you pay for....it does not fly like it claims. It basically takes off and does a nose dive. My son was really excited to see it fly and then he was let down.
2,There's MUCH better available!,"It's not my way to write reviews that recommend a different product over the one under consideration. An exception must be made however when it comes to PASSPORT's JACK BENNY COLLECTION.If you're looking for the best, largest and most cost-efficient gathering of Benny TV shows, check out MILL CREEK'sTHE BEST OF JACK BENNY. Here's why:TWICE the running time of PASSPORT's set, including EVERYTHING that's here, all neatly packed in a space-saving plastic snap box that's a fraction of the size of this bulky behemoth.No constant on-screen watermark, like PASSPORT."
2,THIS AIN'T WORTH THE MONEY OR TIME!,DON'T THINK ABOUT GETTING THIS COLLECTION. ALMOST ALL OF THE EPISODES ARE CUT AND IT TAKES ELEVEN SECONDS FOR EACH NEW SCENE TO START! THE GUALITY IS TERRIBLE AND SO IS THE SOUND MOST OF THE EPISODES SKIP AND THE SCREEN IS TOO BRIGHT. THE COMPANY WHO MADE THESE DVD'S (MADACY) MUST HAVE BEEN OUT OF THEIR GOURDS OR SMOKING SOMETHING. SO DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS COLLECTION!
5,Definitely recommend for 1st time audio install,"This was my first attempt on an audio install and it was a breeze because of this adapter! I soldered this in my house the night before then just plugged and played.Despite what amazon says, this fits an 04 Jeep Wrangler (all models) with 4 speaker set up (2 front and 2 sound pods)"
2,Not for 2007 Jeep Wrangler,"This stated it would work on a 2007 jeep wrangler, it will not. found out after I had all the wires soldered. Ended up getting one local that worked,gave 2 stars due to the fast shipping and the product was well made, just not for my vehicle."
1,Didn't work in 2004 Jeep Liberty,Disappointed to say this harness would not work in the 2004 Jeep Liberty. While easy to understand and install there is some incompatibility with the wiring harness and the stereo.
4,Diagram doesn't match,"Wire harness was a good match for my 2005 Ram 1500. My only issue was that the wire diagram didn't match the harness; some of the colors didn't match, just like the other reviewer mentioned. Also, I have never installed in a Dodge before and the 2 yellows and 2 blacks made me question wiring those up; so I just tied those together and treated them as one yellow and one black."
4,Decent Adapter Harness for 2004 Jeep liberty,"Bought adapter harness to install my Pioneer DEH-4200UB after-market stereo into my 2004 Jeep Liberty. I soldered the wires to the CD Deck harness wires and plugged in both ends. Worked like a charm except for the dimmer function seems to not be working (supposed to be the orange wire but the dimmer does not work). Also there are two wires on this harness that are never mentioned within the documentation (brown and blue), not really sure what these wires are for (maybe the actual dimmer function?). This product did make my deck install insanely fast and I recommend this product for installing an aftermarket stereo into a 2004 jeep liberty. I can only imagine that this will fit almost all of the other Chrysler vehicles that it says its for."
2,WRONG,We ordered this wiring harness because Amazon's fit finder said it would fit our Dodge....it doesn't! We have a 2002 Dodge Dakota Extra Cab and needed the harness with two separate plugs. I gave 2 stars because the product seems well made and was easy to figure out. We are wondering if this harness is strictly for cars and not trucks for the years specified? Not sure...but double check before you buy!
5,A great box set!,"This is how they should've done the 10 Faces of Sonny Chiba box, a few years ago. The movies have their original Japanese audio, the transfer is very good, the box is very nice, and there's also an included booklet about Sue Shiomi and the director. Jam-packed with martial hijinks and zany comic book baddies, this set comes highly recommended for the choppy-socky audience."
2,great features - poor performance,"On the good side: this phone has an amazing array of features at a reasonable price.On the bad side: the range is TERRIBLE. If I go to the next room, less than 15 ft away with no source of interference, I start hearing annoying clicking sounds. Sometimes this even happens when I'm right next to the phone. If I go outside, still only 20 or 30 ft away, the phone stops working completely. Now, I happen to have aluminum siding, which the manual warns about, but, EVERY other cordless I have owned worked just fine outside for 300 - 500 ft, at least several houses away.Another minor annoyance: For some bizarre reason, reviewing the caller ID memory does NOT show the calls in the order that they were received. I have to press the review button maybe twenty times to see who the last caller was. I dunno. maybe I'm doing something wrong.Bottom line: Avoid this phone. I do not recommend it."
2,FAIR AT BEST,"1. CALLER I.D.: The first reviewer was correct! The caller I.D. is messed up! It does NOT show you the calls in order! It'll tell you ie. 3 new calls, but if they've called you in the past, you have to scroll thru all the phone numbers and look at dates & times that people called. THIS IS HORRIBLE! What takes 2 seconds on most phones takes you several minutes to do with this phone. I want to know who the new calls are right NOW, not in 10 minutes after tremendous eye stress trying to scroll thru 50 numbers to see who was a new caller.2. MEMORY: There's only room for 50 numbers in memory, not 99 as I read (I believe on Amazon).3. SOUND: The speakerphone is outstanding, one of the best I've heard yet! In addition, people said they can hear me very well. Lastly, the handset is also good quality.SUMMARY! While the speakerphone was great, I did return this phone. I simply cannot live with the stupidity of the way this caller I.D. works! Thank you!"
2,Terrible reception,"I bought this model on sale at a local store.... I liked the features, but the reception (sound quality) was terrible, a lot of static.It is way worse than in a 900MHz phone that I have, the type one can now buy for $9.99.Needless to say I returned the phone and now I am looking for a better one."
2,Disappointing Purchase,"I was quite disappointed when I received this book. The pages are not much better than poorly made photocopies and even the grammar is incorrect in several places. If you are looking for a quality, in depth reference manual, this book is not for you. If you are a beginner just looking for any kind of Reports reference guide, this book may work for you."
2,Oracle Reports Review,"The manual consisted of zerox copies! For the price I paid, I expected better quality and more substance."
1,Not for a true beginner,If you are familiar with a GUI report builder then maybe thiswill work for you. If you are a true beginner with no GUI expereience then forget this book.
1,Not for a beginner,If you have no experience with a GUI report builder youwill not learn it from this book. If you know what you are doing it might be a good reference tool but if you are a truebeginner then forget it - look elsewhere.
1,Where is the beef?,"This book concludes that there is such a thing as office politics, and that you can do something about. But it does not go into any details, as to how these games are played, or by what kind of people. Nor does it give information, on how to play along , or how to guard against being manipulated. 21 Dirty Tricks at Work: How to Win at Office Politics, is however an excellent book on this subject."
1,Not for exercise,"I purchased this product and because it beared a brand name, I thought the quality would be better. After wearing the suit once while walking, the armpits tore at the seam and the seat of the pants tore where there wasn't a seam.I recommend that the product not be used during any type of activity in order to extend the life of the suit."
2,Good product but...,"I have used other sauna suits in the past and found that after excessive use, say aerobics and pilates 5 days a week, that they all begin to rip. This item is no exception. I thought that since it was Bally's that the vinyl would be a bit more durable. Not so. After one week, it started to rip. I may invest in the more expensive Nylon type next time."
5,The Widow' Broom,I read this book to a fourth grade class in New Hampshire plus read it to four grandchildren. It was a hit! They loved it and I loved reading it to them. Of course I read it in the classroom on Halloween and wore a witch's costume and carried a broom similar to the one in the picture!
5,Excellent Book,This is one of my favorite books. When reading with and to children at school I always find a way to get this one read. It's an excellent choice for oral reading. The kids love it!
5,Great book!,"This is one of my favorite books by the author. The illustrations are very good, as always, but the story itself is just wonderful and with a great sense of humor and a clever ending. My kids really like it, too, I should mention, but as most of Van Allsburg's books, they are not just for children but any age to enjoy."
5,The Book of No,"What a relief to find a book that makes clear exactly how to say that most difficult word. Saying ""no"" is often - and usually - so weighted down with feelings of guilt that it has, before reading this book, always been easier to say ""yes"" to even the most unwanted of requests. The book is empowering. It bears many rereadings and, in addition to being helpful, it is a real pleasure to read. And heartwarming to know how many, of us are - or were!- in the same boat. Thanks and bravo to Susan Newman for taking on so useful a subject."
5,the 'Queen of No' approves,"Take it from a former, very tired, do gooder, co-dependent-this book delivers! It will be a fast fun read, that get straight to the point, all the examples of saying no and the hows and whys- will -Im very sure- give you the confidence to say no the next time you want out. Say YES to you!."
3,"Just ""ok""",Lots of examples of how to say no but not much of what actually defines someone who always says YES. If you have already read books about why you say YES all the time then this book will help a little. It will give you examples of how to say NO and what to say to people who always get you to do things you don't want to do. Beyond that it is not much help. Your money is better spent on buying a book telling you WHY it is so hard for you to say No to people.
1,"Ouch! The ""NO"" I Learned Was Say ""NO"" to Buying This Book.","Gosh, I was so disappointed in this book. Bought it as a gift for someone who can never say ""no"", but I didn't give it to her. The majority of Dr Newman's examples, which make up at least 90% of the book, are far too harsh to be of any use. If you want to alientate your friends and realtives, be mean to your kids, and get fired from your job, then go ahead and say this stuff to them. Personally, I expected some well-thought out and much more diplomatic advice. I don't see how this kind of ""in your face talk"" is going to do anything but cause more trouble. All I learned was I wish I would have said a big NO! to purchasing this book."
5,Stupendous!!,"This is the book I've needed for years! It not only alerts you to the dynamic you're facing with each opportunity to say no, it suggests actual words to get your point across. When, as so often happens (despite being a professional writer!), I'm at a loss for words with people who deserve to be told ""no,"" I need the help of this excellent source of scripts. The hoped-for sequel: INDUSTRIAL-STRENGTH ""NO"": Dealing With People Who Refuse to Take No for an Answer.Tiffany Holmes"
5,"Just as it says,...","... this book presents SF and fantasy stories to readers who might not initially have a taste for the SF genre. A good mix of material, and a good indoctrination for new SF readers."
3,victor and marcus,there were some cheesy vocals on the cd however when marcus miller plays with victor on the track caalled panther that is worth the price of both the double cd set.
1,waste of money,"I like Victor Wooten, but this cd is almost a total waste of money. If it were not for Teen Town, it would be a total waste of money. Michael Ross was right on target with his review. VW's other stuff is great, but this cd really bites. Not enough bass playing and too much talking. Just cut the chatter and it could possibly make it to 2 stars. Probably the worst live cd I have ever heard. Victor Wooten is great, but this cd is not."
2,Not very impressive.,"I'm a big fan of the Flecktones, and Victor Wootens bass skills especially, but this CD just doesn't cut it for me. I thought there'd be some major jam sessions, there are, but at the cost of some very cheesy and poorly written lyrics. There is way to many special guest at times, and all of the chatter on stage during sounds gets very annoying. I expected only Victor and a bass guitar, true, there are a few songs where it's just him, but then the rest of the group ruins it. Maybe my expectations were to high after hearing his work on the Flecktones......."
3,Victor: only instrumental...,Disappointing. The best moments of the album are when Victor is silent. Lots of shouting. Very unnecessary noise. No wonder that Victor won awards in instrumental cds. I don't recommend buying unless you're a fan. Like me :)
5,great pictures,"I grew up with this book, and it is so fun. I have yet to find any story that explains the Plan of Salvation so well. And the illustrations are really cute. Also, get the cd. The music is amazing and goes along with the story. In fact, if I could get only one cd for my kids (whenever I have them) it would be this one."
5,treasure,"For people of all ages. I had it for my children, now I found it again for a grand daughter.It shows us what is important to attain in life and what the true treasures are.It was written by a ""mormon"" but I think it reveals true values for all of us no matter the age we are."
4,Works fine for 2001 Suzuki Vitara,"After replacing the radiator in my 2001 Suzuki Vitara, the upper radiator hose developed a crack causing the system to lose coolant and pressure. I ordered this hose from Amazon since it was available with next-day delivery. The hose arrived well packaged, although it had a few cobwebs inside the hose itself (must've been sitting on a shelf awhile).The hose need to be cut to fit, but surprisingly gives a better fit than the oem hose did. I have been driving with it in place for 3 weeks now and have had zero issues. Very happy with this hose!"
1,No content,"Regardless of whether you start from the perspective of a skeptic or a believer, you won't learn anything from content free, poorly made this movie. Some of the very positive reviews sound a bit self promotional. Of course, I don't think there's a conspiracy by people involved in the production of the movie to give it four or five stars. I'm just sayin'...."
3,Solid Film With Lots Of Information On Secret Societies,"There's a Freemason Hall just a mile from where my BF lives and every time we pass by we wonder what sort of meetings and rituals may be going on. I'd like to believe it's something really interesting or even a bit creepy, though it could be just a bunch of old guys sitting at a table playing poker. I watched this film to get an inside view of what a Freemason Hall looks like and to learn some facts as to what it was all about. They also take a look at other Secret Societies such as the Illuminati, as well as the New World Order. What's not to love about Secret Society theories and information? Unlike some other films that really bend the mind, this one was interesting and easy to grasp, there were even some humorous parts. Anyone who's interested in learning more about these groups should definitely watch this film. You won't be disappointed."
1,flim flam,"The production is poorly organized. After 20 minutes of dark, computer-generated graphics and badly recorded eerie music I realized that I had learned NOTHING! This was a waste of time and money."
3,"Three-and-a-half stars...If you are looking into the Masons in your neighborhood, don't bother. But for history, view watch it!","I am sorry the couple that claimsto have thrown it into their thisionto their fireplace, needed moreeducation on the subject. Or maybemore firewood! This is very good.Better than the raving Texe Marrs orwatered down Dan Brown stuff. Pick UpOn It!"
5,Wonderfully charming and sensuous,"This third title in the Buckhorn Brothers series showcasing the chemistry between Gabe and Lizzy (Elizabeth) was amazing! A non-stop read in which a very sexy yet sensitive man is the first to express his love for a vulnerable and captivating young lady. When the two get around to ""third base"" and how Lizzy believes Gabe is for real and forever is a delight. Looking forward to the fourth title, Lori Foster!"
5,A fun and fast-paced romance.,"Gabe is the gorgeous guy of the Hudson family, and he's also the least likely to settle down with just one woman. Especially one very red-haired, freckled, scholarly woman. But Gabe falls head over heels in love with Lizzy, who is unlike anyone he's ever dated. Unfortunately, Lizzy is well aware that she's not Gabe's usual ""type,"" and is ready to head for home as soon as she gets what she needs from him."
5,Gave,Wow. Just wow. He's hot and sexy. Outdoorsy and down to earth. His momma definitely raised him right! Country boy and hardworking man. Just loved this one
5,Warning - This series is addictive - off to read book 4!,"This series is fantastic you have four handsome, intelligent, real honest men who love women. The underline theme is that good men do exist. Each brother gets his own book and each fall in love even though they don't want to.... Buy the whole series, get glass of favorite beverage and they will leave with a smile! Buckhorn Brothers Series Sawyer (Book 1), Morgan (Book 2), Gabe (Book 3),Jordan (Book 4) and Casey (Book 5 published in 2002),"
1,One star is one star too many,"This movie is really a dog. If any of you Ted Raimi fans out there ever watch this one and then later meet Ted, don't let him know you watched it. He'll make fun of you! Now that's the sign of a really bad movie! No redeeming factors here that I can see at all. Now, if you'll all excuse me, I think I'll go watch some paint dry."
1,Silence of the Lambs Too,"A low rent, horribly written, acted, and directed exploitation film, Skinner tries to be ""Silence of the Lambs Too"", with ""Xena's"" Joxer (Ted Raimi) as Dennis Skinner, the Buffalo Bill character who likes to skin his victims and play dress up, and Traci Lords as the female protagonist determined to track him down. Apparently, (this is never explained in the story) Lords' character was one of Skinner's victims who managed to escape before he finished the dirty deed. She has nasty scars on her arm and leg and has to inject herself with something, presumably to ease the pain. Throughout the movie, she either stands in water or limps around muttering threats of revenge, mostly unintelligible as the audio in this movie sucked. Worse still, the DVD has visible frame roll. Don't bother."
1,DVD is EDITED,"The DVD is the EDITED R-rated version and is missing all the intense gore effects in the original ""unrated"" VHS release. It's also an awful transfer so avoid at all costs. The uncut VHS version is definitely worth a look, though....even if just for the excellent grue."
2,An interesting failure,"Worth watching once to see the movie it might have been. An amazing performance from Raimi, who slides deftly among the layers of the psychopathic title character without once overplaying his hand in a truly chilling performance. Ricki Lake is also subtle and effective as the unhappy landlady with a slowly growing attraction for her strange boarder. Unfortuately, the high-caliber performances are wasted on a meandering script and unfocused direction -- and a fatally slow pace which destroys any interest we might have in what's going on. As for the gore, it isn't that it's too much, it's that it's not enough. Too little and too late, it's almost half-an-hour before we know anything more about the movie than what we read on the box, and by then we're no longer interested. A shame, and most of the people involved deserved better."
2,Movie to be Studied...,"Skinner. Quite a self explanatory title for this badly edited movie. I thought the plot had been fine but it needed more work. I believe the story was much too short in order to fully go into the plot enough. I saw several scenes that annoyed me in how horribly edited they were and vital parts of speech, that would have better filled out the characters, cut out. Something good I can say about this is that the acting was interesting fake when it came to Ricki Lake, but I was impressed by Ted Raimi's call on the classic homicidal manic. To tell you the truth I think you should pay close attention to the relationship between Traci Lord's character of Heidi and Raimi's character of Dennis. It all comes down to them. Bottom line, this is a wacko against humanity movie and at some points you actually feel pity for the insane murderer. I would recommended this as a great movie to study, if only for a short while."
1,Terrible!,"This film is truely terrible. Everything about it sucks, the sound is awful and the picture isn't any better. This is the worst DVD transfer i have saw, some might say that is reflected in the price (i bought the double feature with The Surgeon included) but there is alot of budget DVD's out there that do a fine job in both departments. Where was the brutal gore the inside sleeve promised? Maybe that was the bit when the picture started to roll and i missed it! If your looking for a good slasher film with lots of gore pay a bit extra and go for The New York Ripper. Stay away from this rubbish."
2,Only out of love for Ted do I give this two stars,"Ted Raimi is this movie's only saving grace, and the only reason I bought it. Here's a question for you: If Traci Lord's vengeful character Heidi is so ashamed of the way she looks, then why does she spend the whole movie dressed in nothing but lingerie and a trench coat? And did you notice that Dennis carves up that chicken with a dirty knife? Yuck! This movie was obviously the brain child of a male mind. Don't bother unless you are a big Ted Raimi fan."
3,a crappy transfer for dvd only worth the money for ted raimi,"i only ordered skinner only because it is a hard to find title and after seeing a interview in a issue of fangoria on ted raimi it looked like it could of been a graet horror flick. After viewing simitar's transfer to disc all i can say is that it is a terrible transfer the sound echos and even a bad jump in the picture that is obvisiously from the master tape used in the transfer. the only thing keeping this this low budget shocker afloat is ted raimi fine performance that makes me still gives this film 3 stars. there is one thing that was not explained in the film ""what is skinners obsessession with running water?"" Overall it was an interesting low budget flick that also gets my thumbs up to KNB for the fx."
5,Rating Product,"All the information I needed, was in this manual. I did my research, but am still happy with the condition of manual."
2,very basic,"This book is written on a junior-high or high school level. Not horrible, but needs the correct audience. It portrays itself as being more sophisticated than it is."
3,Nothing New,"Fully agree with E. Puzzo review, and furthermore, nothing that we have not already seen, heard or read.But if you are an avid collector of Callas related things as I am, then buy it.It's not a waste by any means, still enjoyable."
4,Suspense,Alistair McLean excels in creating a complex and suspenseful twist of events and characters in such a wy that you dont know whats going to happen next.This is a thriller all the way and a masterful one at that. A great read.
1,A Dated Book,"I had great difficulty finishing this book. I thought that the writing style was terrible & the plot silly. True, the story takes place & was written in the late sixties so the writing might be dated. If so, the book is far from a classic. I think the book was made into a lackluster movie too. I'm beginning to wonder about the quality of the author's other books. I've thoroughly enjoyed the movies ""Ice Station Zebra"" & ""Where Eagles Dare"" (a real favorite of mine) but I think now that I'll pass on the book versions."
4,cute toy,This is so cute. It would work better if the bottom wasn't covered in fabric. my cats love feathers
1,Waste of money,The size of this is a little bigger then a babies hand. I got some ugly color the listing does not say random color choosen or what not. Most of the feathers was off mine & not loose in the box. So i take it they fell out before packaged. Really poorly made. This will go in the trash since it is to small & do not want my cat choking on feathers which pluck out so easy.
1,Piece of junk,"I use measuring tapes on transects to monitor vegetation. I had previously purchased this brand and length and had used it for four monitoring seasons before it finally broke. This tape began to tear the first day, and broke in 6 places within three days of use. When I compared the two tapes, I found that the new tape was noticably thinner than the old.I would have gladly paid twice as much to get better quality, but 400 foot tapes are simply not available. I'm tired of cheap Chinese made products that cost me in time wasted. Doesn't the manufacturer understand that these tapes will be stretched?"
1,Broken on arrival,"For some reason, measuring tapes of this length are hard to come by. So I was really hoping this was better than some reviews suggested. Sadly it wasn't.It was broken when I opened the box, and in the same spot that a previous reviewer had an issue. So it would seem to be a design flaw.Guess I'll keep looking."
4,Beethoven in Berlin by Bernstein and a cast of thousands!,"Bernstein insisted on substituting ""Freiheit"" or ""freedom"" for ""Freude"" or ""Joy"" in the Ode. So the last movement became ""The Ode to Freedom."" Beethoven would have approved, I think.I was in Europe during that incredible Fall of 1989. We were in Budapest when the Romanians abruptly rose up and tried and executed their tyrant and his wife in less than 24 hours. The feeling in the air was indescribable. I watched this broadcast from London on Christmas Day and cried throughout. It is not the greatest performance of the 9th -- the crowd of performers was too large. Perfection was not the point. Passion was the point. It included children's choirs as well - the future. At the end Lenny fell into a dream and basically stopped conducting - and the symphony musicians and the singers continued on, faultlessly, without the conductor. It must be the brightest memory for all of them. The description on this site is inadequate."
5,Fall of the Berlin Wall,Excellent! I watched in 1989 and it was just as gripping today. It is a must buy for any history buff and music lover.
5,Quality item!,"if you've ever bought a clip-on lamp, you probably learned these lessons:- if the clip is made of plastic, it will break. Don't buy these.- if the switch feels cheap, it probably is cheap, and will break. Avoid those.- you get what you pay for, a lot of these are under $20. They won't last.This lamp is more expensive than the ones you will find at Wal Mart or Target, but it is a far better product. The switch is sturdy; it actually feels good to turn it on and off, and that's saying something for a clip-on lamp. It looks classy. The clamp is metal. It's a winner.The spring in the clip could be a bit stronger. When clamped vertically it tends to slip. Otherwise perfect."
5,This lamp's a keeper,"This small, neat lamp is perfect wherever you need a clip-on lamp that doesn't look trendy or trite. This piece has an industrial look that matches the purpose very well. Aside from the ever-important appearance: For me it functions as a kitchen lamp, and it sheds light without overheating and with a firm grip. Five stars"
2,Not worth the money spent,"The 7"" LCD Portable display was not worth the money I spent to own it. First the battery would not hold enough charge to be considered portable. When the device was plugged in the picture would become distorted if you did not charge before hand. After one and a half months of having ... ""not usage time"" ... the sound would not work correctly nthen the picture started to fade out. Shortly after that the AC/DC (wall plug in) would not give the device enough power to even staqrt a movie. Unless you can personally verify the circuit level quality of this item your self, then do nto buy this."
3,It's Okay,"I bought this for my dad a while ago and it worked for a couple of months then the screen stopped working. You have to leave the screen open for a couple of minutes before you can even see the blue dvd screen, then close it before you can even watch a dvd."
1,Did not work right,Did not work very good it would say it was open when I had it shut and the hole screen would go white after 20 mins
2,Pretty good DVD Player,"It has worked well, however since the first day of purchase the power cord buzzes as if it's going to blow out. The volume is really low and the iPod player is not for iPhones. Other then those issues, it is overall a good DVD player."
2,Does not work with ipod classic 80gb,"This is a decent product, but it DOES NOT WORK WITH IPOD CLASSIC 80gb. Product description says it works with 80gb ipod, but it only works with the older model. Buyer beware. As far as I can tell, there isn't a portable dvd player that does work with the ipod classic 80gb. 12/2007"
5,Delightful quirky music,"This is the first non-English album I have heard and I say I am hooked! Instantly, u love the quirky hooks and catchy melodies that are both riveting and addictive. Hailing from the the Neue Deutsche Welle or 'New German Wave', Wir sind Helden or ""We are heroes"" are a quartet consisting of lead vocalist and guitarist Judith Holofernes, Pola Roy at drums, bassist Mark Tavassol and keyboardist Jean-Michel Tourette. Four singles are released from the album sofar and all are gems, namely ""Nur ein Wort"", ""Gekommen um zu bleiben"", ""Von hier an blind"" and ""Wenn es passiert"". My personal favourite is ""Nur ein Wort"" - a cheery upbeat song, very folksy sound coupled with a feet tapping beat. Their sound is very analog, unlike the deluge of digitalised music we hear nowadays. This album is quickly a personal Top 5 album for 2005."
4,German Indie Rock with female vocals.,"I like the songs as a whole. If you like Sleater-Kinney, you may like this. The lyrics are in German sung be a female named Judith. I love her tone and full voice. Do yourself a favor and find some of their videos on Youtube. Even though the CD isn't ""perfect"", it's a good indie/folk/soft rock sound that grows on you with each listen."
2,Good if you're going to the Caribbean,"If you're going on their itinerary, this might be a helpful book to read about port options, etc. If you're staying at the Ritz of the ship, you can know the extras you're going to get. I've been on an Alaskan cruise, and will be going on a Mediterranean cruise next summer, and NOT staying in a suite.I found it to be amusing (but not laugh out loud funny) but not particularly helpful. The only thing I learned from this book is to take a travel mug. Good tip, but not worth the price of the book."
4,The truth about cruising,"I purchased this book for my son and his wife, who will soon be going on their first cruise. Upon receiving the book, the temptation to read it before wrapping it was too hard to resist. Within the first couple of pages, I was re-living our own cruises. I laughed through the entire thing and found it would be beneficial to first time cruisers - and enjoyable for seasoned cruisers. The only thing not applicable to many is the fact that the people in the book had a suite, not a regular inside or outside stateroom, which made their experience different in several ways. Plus the cruiseline is a bit more formal than some out there."
2,Whoopi Wipes Out,"This movie is but a shadow of what her other movies have been. Whoopi can do incredible movies and she can do horrible movies that are some how guilty pleasures. But this was just terrible. The problem is that we spend what feels like 4 hours building up to an ending that falls flat and drags out.The movie has a great idea: Santa Claus must retire and be replaced - BY WHOOPI!! Great, wonderful, let me see that. We needed a movie that sees Whoopi as Santa Claus almost immediately. The cute Scrooge moments could have happened as she saw the North Pole and had to deliver gifts. But no, Whoopi is Santa for all of ten minutes, and by that point I was bored out of my mind and ready to go. This was clearly just a paycheck for Whoopi."
4,Call Me Claus DVD,Whoopi Goldberg adds a new twist to a Santa Claus story that is not only entertaining but well acted. Excellent addition for anyone who has a Christmas movie collection.
5,movie,This is a really great tape to watch and so much fun for the holidays came in in great shape and arrived ontime
1,"A classic? Uh, I think not.","I'm actually a huge fan of Nigel Hawthorne but he is horribly miscast in this Christmas turkey. Not a convincing Santa Claus at all and the idea of him turning to Whoopi Goldberg to become the next Santa was a pathetic idea at best. I mean, Kris Kringle has nothing better to do in the run-up to Christmas than associate himself with a money-grubbing home-shopping network??? Give me ""Miracle on 34th St"", ""A Christmas Story"", or ""The Polar Express"" anyday over this. In fact, I didn't even see ""Call Me Claus"" broadcast on ANY station this year. May Nigel Hawthorne be forever remembered as Sir Humphrey Appleby or King George rather than this drivel."
4,Only way to feel the noise is when it's good and loud,"This is one of the first Motorhead albums I bought, way back in '88. Not a bad live album. Though the sound quality isn't that great, there's a good selection of songs. Standards like ""Ace of Spades"" and ""Overkill"". Also included is one of my favorite MH tunes: ""Just 'Cos You Got the Power..."" (I couldn't find the original version until I got the re-issue of Rock 'n' Roll).If you're a big Motorhead fan you should pick this up. It's Rocks! \m/"
4,The best metal to run to,I can't count how many times I used to listen to this album on my old cassette player while going for a run. Just hearing the samples again makes my lungs burn! The straightforward raw intensity of this album makes it great to vent frustrations out in the gym. Tasting a minute metallic tinge of blood in your mouth brought on by a hard workout is the only appropriate side effect when listening to this album!
5,Good Basic Phone,"About six weeks ago I purchased this phone to replace one that was probably 15 years old. I paid $9.99 for it at Big Lots and have been satisfied with it so far, but for ten bucks how can you go wrong. It sounds good and is nice and clear. So far I have no complaints.I purchased this phone in March 2005 and it has already died (Sept 05). I guess you get what you pay for."
4,Very Good,Gives you a very clear and interesting account of what ignoring basic rules can do to bring on a catastrophoe.
5,our family LOVES this video!,"These were the first songs my daughter sang, and she hasn't stopped singing them in the year since she first saw the video.Laurie Berkner is funky and fun and fresh, something the kids love that doesn't grate the nerves. could you ask for more?"
1,Not what you think,"What a disappointing surprise. I was so excited to find this item because we love Laurie's music. However, this video is terrible. It looks like it was made in someone's garage and the sound is aweful. I wouldn't even try to sell it or give it to someone, I just threw it out. I didn't want to give it even one star, but I had to. A total waste of money. The CD's are much better. The new DVD, We Are The Laurie Berkner Band was a big disappointment also. It was very lame and not many songs either. Her videos on Noggin are much better. Really, don't waste your money, just record her on Noggin."
3,seems like the tv shows are better than this,"Don't waste your money on this video, it seems that u could watch the tv shows, record them maybe, and use the CD's. Your child will be happier and you will enjoy better quality since this tape was recorded from a live concert and had bad audio."
3,Not as cute as on Noggin!!,I bought this for my 4 yr. old since she was hooked on the cute snippets in between her favorite Noggin shows. I am so disappointed that it is an open book shape in the middle of the screen with Laurie and Susie playing to a live audience (black tv screen with an open book shape that uses only about 1/3 of the tv)....I would much rather have the cute studio look that shows up on Noggin. The songs are cute but I really dislike that it is not even the full size of the screen. She barely watched the first 2 songs before walking away to play with coloring instead. I am not happy with this purchase...I much prefer the plain white background (with full screen visuals) of Laurie's band and the kids dancing to the songs. Save $14.00 and tape Noggin!!
1,Soo disappointing :(,"My son loves Laurie's music (from Noggin and the CDs). We have the CDs in the car so we can play whenever he's cranky and, almost immediatly, he's back being a happy kid. So I bought this tape hoping to give him the same experience of music and dancing. To my surprise, not only the video production is poor, boring, sooo null compared to the vivid, bright colored videos from Noggin; but also the audio quality was terrible. I bought this tape from Amazon and you cannot return video tapes after opening them :[ If I had a glance of the content of this video before buying it, I wouldn't have wasted my time and money on it. I wonder how come Laurie have not recorded a new DVD... she's missing a great opportunity here!"
1,Unwatchable!,My son LOVES Laurie Berkner videos on Noggin. This is NOTHING like it. It's not enjoyable at all. The sound is terrible. It crackles and buzzes on all VCR's I have tried. The picture quality is horrible as well. Horrible. Wish I could have given it zero stars ... and get my money back!
1,Poor Quality,"How dissappointing! Absolutely terrible video quality, very poor sound track with lots of buzzing. It appeared to me as though the tape was a thrice over copy used as a master which severely degraded the picture and sound. I was unable to clear up the picture or the sound by adjusting tracking and I have a brand new, high end VCR/DVD combo unit. This tape looks to have been shot in a high school lunch room and the production quality only supports this opinion. Overall, we viewed this tape once after opening the box and threw it out afterwards because it was of such poor quality all around we considered it useless and a waste of money. I would have better spent my time pirating her videos off of NOGGIN for my son."
3,Not the video I expected,"The songs in this video were all my kids' favorites from NickJr, but the video was NOT of good quality and looked like it was taped by an amateur at a birthday party. The sound wasn't even very good. But, I have to say my kids'(aged 1 and 3) loved it anyway. I would love to see the same videos come out that are shown on NickJr."
3,"love laurie, the video however is average....","my kids love her, so i bought the video,while they seem happy with the video, i have to agree with some of the other people here that have rated this video; very amateurish, looks like someone shot a home video, and what is with those outfits? i am not sure what these girls were thinking...it is a kids video, very inappropriate...laurie is decked out in a tight,short, spandex outfit; her hair is bleached blonde, and she has sparkles all over her face, same with susie...but all in all we still love laurie, and my kids like it,so i guess thats all that counts!"
4,Diggable,"A great, quiet album by the David S. Ware Quartet. They seem to have been able to find a more concentrated vision for this project than for others, and the result is a slow and sublime piece of music which manages both to be meditative and highly experimental. Even the synthesizers sound good (which is kind of hard for me, an avowed synthesizer hater, to admit)! To me, this echoes some of the Chicago Underground Duo's works. Excellent album."
1,"Timmy may be different, but that is not wrong","This book is told from the point of view of a typical child looking at a special needs child. Though a young child might really ask what's wrong with someone, the question as the title implies that there is something wrong with Timmy. That people who are different are somehow ""wrong"" is not the best message to offer children to foster acceptance of differences. We can be different and differently abled without something being ""wrong."" A better choice is ""All Kinds of Friends, Even Green"" by Ellen Sinisi."
2,What's wrong with the author?,"This book is a real nightmare for children with disabilities. Maria Shriver does attempt to impart the message that nothing is wrong at all- unfortunately, she's already planted the seed in the young minds of her readers with the mere title of the book. She then spends an exhaustive twenty pages trying to be sure she'd convinced them of it. I'd recommend ""Russ and the Almost Perfect Day"" by Janet Elizabeth Rickert instead."
5,Amazing concept album for a show with much promise!,"Frankenstein The Musical. Another cheap easy gothic story, turned musical? No way! This new version of Frankenstein is the best re-telling any story has had on stage in history and the music just goes to prove that. Even this CD, as a concept album, is close to the quality of a full-blown Broadway recording! The show has a huge amount of promise and I can't wait until it goes to Broadway and the rest of the world. Believe it or not, I am now a fan of this production and shall be keeping a close eye on it - good luck to you all involved. Bring on the UK production!"
5,Frankenstein ROCKS!!,This cd is absolutely amazing! i completely fell in love with the musical when I heard it!!! I can't wait for the play to finally start touring!
5,"Frankenstein; the Musical, a wonderous creation","I'll start by saying when I found this CD I was a bit skeptical. It had no sound clips, and had mixed reviews, but I decided to give it a chance, finding that most reviews did compare it to Jekyll & Hyde; the Musical. Though it is not as grand as Wildhorn's musical, I would put it in the same category and say that it was very well written. It does have it's high and low moments, but overall it tells the story with some great songs and sticks pretty close to the novel by Mary Shelley (though there are some differences.) My personal favorite song from this musical is 'The Coming of the Dawn', being very inspirational in my opinion, and the moral in the end is well worth the purchase."
2,Claude-Michel Schonberg and Alain Boublil should sue...,"The only reason this has two stars from me is because I haven't seen the production of Frankenstien itself and really do like the idea of a musical. However, has anyone else noticed that the creative team has pretty much ripped off every chord from the Broadway production of Les Miserables? Examples:Birth of my Creation- Who Am ISorrow Born of Dreams- One Day MoreDear Victor- In My Life meets A Heart Full of LoveAmen- Dog Eats Dog and Javert's ThemeThe Modern Prometheus- What Have I DoneThe Coming of The Dawn- One Day More meets Empty Chairs at Empty TablesWhy?- Javert's SuicideThe Chase- Look Down (reprise)The Proposition- The Barricades (""You on the barriciade listen to this"" through ""Damn their warnings damn their lies!"")Try singing these songs to the medley provided on the website. Or, better yet, listen to the two recordings simultaneously. There may be subliminal satanic messages being projected from the speakers.A good day to you all."
2,Major Disappointment,"I'm always looking to discover new musicals so when I read the good reviews of this I was definately intersted. Add to that I am a fan of several of the vocalists on this album and I was really looking foreward to listening.I won't say this is comepletely worthless. ""The Workings of the Heart"" is a lovely song, and ""Why"" has it's moments. Shuler Hensley, Ivan Rutherford, and Rita Harvey sound good in their roles. But I didn't feel that was worth the price of the CD.Other reviewers compare this to Jekyll and Hyde. That can be a good thing and a bad thing. While J&H; is undeniably entertaining it holds little in the way of origonality or musical value. Each song is derivitive of another, better song. Frankenstein a poor man's version of Jekyll and Hyde. It lacks the lovely ballads and occasional dramatic tension that make J&H; fun but it attempts to recreate them. The result is a watered down version of something that wasn't all that great to begin with."
1,Trite and Insipid,"I'm a huge musical theatre fan and bought this CD on amazon.com based solely on the glowing, positive reviews that were posted here.I'm sorry to say that this is one of the worst musicals I've ever had the misfortune to listen to. The orchestrations are trite and predictable. The rhymes are completely insipid and an absolute torture of the English language. I found myself continually groaning and rolling my eyes at the painfulness of it all.Also, it's completely derivative of ""Jekyl & Hyde,"" without any of the quality music and lyrics. Do not buy this CD if you enjoy quality musical theatre. You will be sorely disappointed."
1,Couldn't like it,"This CD just didn't do it for me, perhaps unfairly. If you've listened to ""Jekyll & Hyde"" this seemed like a pale shadow of that, both music and story-wise. I couldn't help but compare the very similar plot-line and the much less engaging but similar songs. The singers, too, I thought were also lacking with the exception of Shuler Hensley (who was great as Jud in the 1998 London cast recording of Oklahoma.) Despite the reasonable price and mostly glowing reviews which lead me to take a chance on this CD despite the lack of sample musical clips, this one wasn't a keeper for me and I cannot recommend it."
4,Good product butt...,"This seems to be a good product but has some flimsy parts.the frame is good and durable, but the pedals and crank are a bit weak. the tensioner is all but useless. the product does perform well. I've been using for about 3 weeks and so far so good. For the price you can't expect the greatest product, but it is a solid performer. It is well worth the money."
2,Poor quality for the cost,"I picked this up for fifteen dollars at a discount store. It is very cheaply constructed. The grips on the bottom are not sufficient to keep the bike from sliding away from you as you pedal. I had to put a 15 lb tub of cat litter in front of it to be able to exercise without stopping to pull the bike back into position every few minutes. As another reviewer mentioned, this causes me to bump my toes occasionally. The other problem is the tension setting. I find that when I set a tighter tension, it loosens back up fairly quickly. The motion is jerky and it does wobble a bit side to side. If I had paid full price for this, I would be extremely disappointed."
1,Couldn't be more disappointed,"I'm actually pretty impressed with how easy this was to assemble. Only took 5 minutes or so, and it feels high quality.Using it however, makes it completely worthless. I picked this up for $10 at my local Ross Dress for Less, and I see why it was so cheap.It slides all over the place, and the only way to stop that is to put something stable in front of it (like a wall,) but then that makes your foot hit it on every rotation. Even then, it wobbles from side to side when you pedal, shifting position. It's also annoying while pedaling because the strokes are uneven and jerky. Can't expect much I guess, but this makes it useless.I'm throwing mine in the trash."
2,"Okay, but not great","I purchased this camera because Canon has a good reputation with cameras. I had a Richot which I have lost and needed a new camera. The quality of the shots from the Richot seemed much clearer than those from the Canon. I find the pictures are good but not quiet as sharp as from my other cameras. I also found the manual for handling the camera to not be user friendly - which is really rare since most companies try to make it easier for the user to grasp the concept of the new camera and its features. In my eyes, the camera will do for now, but I'm not sure of how long it will be before I replace it."
2,"Fair, but not worth the price","This is a very sturdy and reliable camera, but it is not worth the money. The photos can lack clarity, especially when using the close-up features."
4,Good read,"The book was very good in holding your attention. The author wrote about male female relationships and the situations people deal with. It described anger, jealously, strength, forgivness, and determination that the characters went through."
4,Good Read,"I have read Seasons before many years ago and I passed it on to the President of our book club to read first.We just finished Now and Then,Again by this author and so we have decided that this will be our next book.I was amazed that I got this hardcovered copy of the book for a penny plus shipping.I was surprised when I went to my mailbox and got this book it was so new looking for a used book.I am very satisfied with the books that Amazon.com carries from the Walk Worthy Press.This book is a Good Read."
4,Prescribed Textbook for Quality Papers,"This book is used in the local university as a prescribed textbook for few postgraduate papers in the subject related to Quality and Quality Assurance. The textbook may be considered 'old', but the ideas are still relevant today as many quality related 'theories' are revamp cosmetically for commercial reasons...I believe its a 'must-have' reference-style book for any quality people whom may be familiar with one 'tool' but not other tools, the book provide steps for each theory backing it up with one or two case studies to help reader understand how each process works in the 'real world'.I believe the book is useful for both 'manufacturing' industry as well as 'service' industry."
3,Medicore,"The book provides only a skimming look at the Colonel's life. I was looking for a book that went more into his past and how he built up the KFC franchise. This gets into his personal life, but doesn't focus well on any particular area. Was still a good read."
1,Annoyed......,"I ordered this item on July 27 with Amazon Prime 2 day shipping....it is now Dec 13 and Amazon is telling me shipment will take place in January!!!!! Amazon...don""t advertise items you do not have (surely this can be tracked with a computer) and have me pay for your great prime shipping service when you don""t have the items to begin with! I would give this ) stars if I could"
2,keeps getting worse,"i was once a big tinsley ellis fan enjoying such albums as fanning the flames and trouble in mind. but what was once a fresh sound and fresh guitar has become increasingly stale. having seen tinsley live three times he sure left all his good stuff at home on this album, he even manages to screw up highway man which is one of my favorites. i know tinsley has felt he hasnt gotten his just due as a performer but efforts like this won't help his cause."
5,Live Highwayman,"This CD seems to be left in my CD player and played over and over. It is just a fantabulous disc. I've been to Chord on Blues in St. Charles, IL where this was recorded but have yet to catch Tinsley there. For a guy from Atlanta he gets there often and I intend to see him there on one of his next visits. It is one solid CD, get one for the house and one for the car."
2,Do not order with Lamps Plus!,"Shipping time was good. But the lamp switch was broken. I was not able to return it to a local store [!] but had to ship it back and pay for shipping!. Yes, Lamps Plus makes the customer pay for return shipping when an item is BROKEN. I will never online order with them again. This is too dangerous. What if a larger item is broken and I have to pay for return shipping? Better stick with Amazon and their excellent return policy if you look for a lamp like this."
5,I loved this study guide on ALL the women of the Bible.,"I never realized just how many women there are in the Bible until I bought this book and read it. Every woman and I mean EVERY woman mentioned in the Bible is in this book. I learned soooooo much and learned of women that I had never heard of before this book. The Biblicaly inept series are great, this is the second one I have done and I love them! I take my to work to study before my shift begans and I don't have to carry my Bible because the scripture is listed before every study paragraph. Every verse is explained in easy to understand language and to see how much you have learned at the end of each chapter are a few study questions. Each chapter has a section at the end of the highlights of each chapter. Difficult words are defined and explained. Excellent bible study. This book is for both the beginner and the advanced believer."
5,The women around Jesus come to life,"This book is carefully researched, and combines the Biblical stories of the women around Jesus with the author's intuition and artful imagination. The stories are nice for personal reading, or could be used as dramatic monologues in a larger setting. Elegant, surprising, creative!"
1,unhappy,"wrong one was delivered, reordered and again the wrong one came in, not even for my make of car.Will not reorder from this company again."
3,"Great for Competition, Not for Training","This is a great suit for competitions, but not for training. I found that after about a month of wearing to practice 3 times a week, the suit started to break down."
5,GREAT PRODUCT,Great Product - Well packed!fast shipmentgreat communicationgreat sellerwould buy again!
4,+ 1/2 stars...A Thoroughly Satisfying Album,"Over the past several years, Jim Lauderdale has become my favorite singer/songwriter. While HEADED FOR THE HILLS is not the overtly bluegrass album as his two collaborations with Ralph Stanley, there are enough dobros, fiddles and mandolins to make this one of the most satisfying albums of Lauderdale's career.In addition to guest musicians like Emmylou Harris, Tim O'Brien and Gillian Welch, lyricist Robert Hunter co-wrote each of these 13 tracks with Lauderdale, lending the album a backporch feel missing from much of today's country music. Even the idiosyncratic country sounds of Donna the Buffalo on ""Upside Down"" fit nicely on this collection of old timey country songs. Highlights include ""High Timberline,"" ""Crazy Peg and Darby Doyle"" and ""Head for the Sun."" HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
5,Challenging & Fun,"This little book collects 125 (orthodox) chess problems/puzzles/brain-teasers. Each of them was extracted from actual game play in history. Every problem has a chess diagram and comes with the question ""white to move and mate in two."" I personally found solving those puzzles both challenging and fun. Solutions and hints can be found on the last few pages of the book."
3,"Nice Portable Bball hoop, but beware of additional shipping charges!","The shipping company that ships this item to you will call and ask if you have anyone to take the 250+ pound item off of the truck. If you don't, they will charge you an additional $100 to have the driver lower it from a lift gate and place it on your driveway. By the way, you are already being charged over $100 for delivery when you made this purchase."
3,shipping,The shipping company was great. They called the day before to let me know it was coming. They called when they were down the street. They took it off the truck and put it in my basement for me.
4,It's fun for kids,"It's probably a good ""first"" tent for kids to pretend-campout indoors and get used to the idea of sleeping in a tent. It was easy to assemble; it's next to impossible to fold up and put back into its carrying pouch. (I gave up on trying to do it neatly.)"
4,kids fun,"I ordered this for my grand kids,they love it,play in it sleep in it.I'ts very durable,and I think it will last a long time. Very pleased with!!"
1,Major let down,"Couldn't wait to give this toy to my 4 year old for the holidays, and unfortunately it looks a lot better on the box. You can't tell from the box that it is 3 separate pieces that DO NOT stay together. It constantly fell apart. There is no way my son was able to pick it up to play with it, it kept falling apart. Don't waste your money."
5,Money Rocks!,This is a great video for teaching kids about money. I used to watch Schoolhouse Rock on Saturday mornings. I now have the opportunity to pass it on to my son. He has learned principals from this video that he will never forget. It is very educational and assists him in learning while not being taught in a long drawn out boring way. I would recommend this to anyone who needs help laying a foundation to build upon for their family for a long time.
3,Different,I did not perticularly like this book's ending. It was a riveting book up until the end. It fizzles I guess you could say. I would strongly suggest this book to anyone that doesn't care about going out with a bang. I will remember this book. But not for good reasons.
3,Maybe it's me,"Robert Cormier has a way of telling a story that I have seen done by no one else. His books are generally hard to follow, but The Bumblebee Flies Anyway completely lost me. The main character is the control at a facility for terminal patients that have dedicated what remains of their lives to the furthering of medical research. An unexpected twist turns Barney's world upside down, and in the end, I don't know that either of us knew which end was up."
4,Review of The Bumblebee Flies Anyway,"This story was about following our dreams and helping others to find theirs. The main character, Barney Snow, lives in an experimental clinic, where everyone one around him is terminally ill. He helps his friends to build the bumblebee. A bumblebee is not supposed to be able to fly, but it does; therefore, a bumblebee is a miracle. In this Barney made us realize that we can never give up, on life or anything else. It was not important of where Barney lived or who his friends were; he made us realize that we should open up to the people around us and that sometimes people need to some help in pursuing their flight of the bumblebee. The part I liked most about this story was the plot. There was not much action or adventure, but the story always had an unexpected surprise waiting around the corner. This story was not what I would call fast paced, but for some reason, it always kept me on my toes and wanting more."
4,Very Nice Case,"I like this case a lot. It feels nice on my hand, it fits the phone perfectly, not to bulky and looks good. The reason I gave this case 4 starts is that it is kind of hard to press the power and camera buttons; you have to press is really hard. I would buy this case again."
4,"Fits well, but there is one small problem","Got this for a friend. The case looks and fits well on his phone, but the actual protection level is questionable. It's pretty thin in the corners, so if dropped, the phone may very well be destroyed. Hope he doesn't drop it and discover it's protection capabilities the hard way."
4,boxwave,I was pleased with the case especially the fit and durability. It was what I expected. I wish it came in other colors.
4,Adequate for $10,"Seems really sturdy, reasonably attractive, but people really weren't kidding about the challenge re: the on/off button. I carefully cut the hole that some people recommended and it just doesn't look very good and hasn't helped all that much. You still really have to push hard or stick your nail in the now cutout (i.e., wish I hadn't bothered to cut the hole and just gotten used to pushing hard so I wouldn't have messed up the look). I didn't see another case that I was even remotely interested in so at only $10, it will do just fine, but dealing w/the button will get some getting used to."
4,PERFECT IF....,"I bought this on a whim because it was really cheep. From the looks it appears to be one of those 2 piece cases that slide together. It's not. HOWEVER! It is an awesome case to my surprise. It does what I wanted and that's to protect the phone without making it much bigger. It is a rubber case, but it is a firm rubber and it fits very very snug. After getting the hang of it, it also comes off very easily which is a plus when you have 3 batteries. My only issue was the power button was way to firm for me. I had to press way to hard to unlock the phone. All I did was used a razor to cut around the edge of the power button, not cutting one side. Worked like a charm, for a few bucks. I'm not complaining at all. I like it more then my OtterBox Defender Case."
4,great case!,"simple, cheap and easy. Only complaint is that the power button is not exposed. I took a knife and cut out the power button, great fix, but I wish that it would have been cut out previously."
3,Purchased for Ice Cream; Drinking the Rest,"I purchased this very expensive tea powder at the local Asian supermarket for an ice cream recipe. It didn't add much flavor to the ice cream, but did add a beautiful green color. After seeing matcha highly recommended by Dr. Oz, I'm drinking it for the health benefits. I'm a big tea drinker and I have to say this is not very flavorful. I'm looking forward to trying some of the more highly rated brands."
2,Not my favorite. Read my review for other great brands...,"I compared 4 different brands of matcha green teas. Here's how they rate:#1 DO 2nd Harvest, excellent flavor, texture, and color, expensive, organic#2 Serendipi, great flavor, best price for the quality, organic#3 The Tao of Tea, local Portland Oregon company, fair flavor, price slightly lower than DO, organic#4 Maeda-en, available at Uwajimaya. Difficult to dissolve. Less favorable flavor and not organicUwajimaya has best selection of Matcha teas with several others I have not tried yet. Whole Foods carries both DO and Tao of Tea. New Seasons currently does not carry Matcha. Serendipi is available on Amazon for $17/4 oz. box, best tea for your money!"
2,You Get What You Pay For,"A bit disappointing -- the ""Line 1"" and ""Line 2"" switches feel flimsy and likely to break; you really have to click them in to get a dial tone rather than press softly. The speakerphone function works like a 2 way radio, i.e. you can't talk and listen at the same time. If you plan to use this phone as a business phone, forget it; it's a toy. The speakerphone is useful only for listening purposes, and switching between lines causes a quick burst of static, at least on my model. For the price I suppose it's OK, but if you need a work-horse phone with durability and a useful speakerphone, this isn't it."
3,connectors an issue,"I wish ACCEL would have payed more attention to the secure connectors Ford has in their products. My Bronco is off road capable but with this design the stock connector could easily come loose. All ACCEL needed to do was include the ""ears"" or hips to keep it secure. Otherwise it cleared up the miss under acceleration so that's good but at this price I expect proper fitment."
5,First easy to read book on Wavelets,"This book has been written in an easy to read and understand fashion without compromising on the fundamentals. If you wonder what wavelets can do, or what they are, start with this book. Highly recommended for anyone who is starting to learn about wavelets."
4,definitely free flowing,"I put this exhaust on a 4.3 1500 2wd after installing a 350 y-pipe, which is 3"" collector and bolts right up. I also installed a 3"" straight pipe in place of the cat. Its a good-breathing exhaust which does not require spare tire removal. Deep tone at idle, but it won't be confused for a V8.One gripe is that one of the exhaust hangers was not in the correct location; I had to cut it off and reweld it about 4"" down the pipe...this may have just been an issue of 4.3 hangers being different or something."
4,Great show,I first saw this on Showtime & had to have a copy of my own. I would recommend this for anyone who loves Billy Joel & wants to get a little insight into Shea Stadium.
5,Another great Billy Joel video!,We caught this concert on HBO a few weeks ago and knew we had to try and find it. Luckily We found it immediately on Amazon and bought it quickly. We now have been able to enjoy it numerous times!
5,The Last Play at Shea,"The Last Play at Shea is great. If you like great music by Billy Joel and would like to weave it in with the history of this great sports and concert venue then you must see the Last Play at Shea. From the Beatles to the last concert by Billy Joel, it doesn't get any better."
4,"If you are a Billy Joel and NY Met fan, you'll really enjoy this DVD.",Great DVD if you are a Billy Joel and NY Met fan and come from greater the NY city area.
4,surprising emotional stirring for this music documentary,I had not thought about Billy Joel's music too much lately but saw this on Direct TV and immediately ordered a copy. Very stirring to see old baseball footage along with early Billy Joel and Paul McCartney along with current performances. A nice experience
2,Film not concert,"I thought it was the concert, i was surprised that it wasn't. It turned out to be a film. All i wanted was the concert."
2,Warning! 2/9/11 - Won't play on a Mac!,"As much as I liked the film, the DVD would not show up on my Mac and had trouble ejecting the disc (hold eject while restarting). If you're going to buy this, make sure your Mac isn't your primary DVD player."
1,Watch out for bad discs being sold on Amazon!!,"The movie is great, unfortunately i did not get to see it on the disk i bought. Got ripped off by the seller and got no support from Amazon. In a nutshell, the guy sent me a European coded disk that does not play in the USA. Total ripoff. Be careful when buying DVDs, especially since a lot of the sellers are out of the USA. Better off going to Walmart."
4,Dynamite!,"For the size and intent, this is the best book on the market. If you are thiking of becoming a professional wedding planner, this introductory book covers all the things you will have to learn. What it doesn't cover in detail, it points you in the direction of where you can find more information, with recommended websites and book titles. What it won't do, however, is teach you all the minute and various specific details that apply to your market and jurisdiction. As with any business, you still have to do a lot of legwork before you can actually make any money. Nevertheless, I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to know exactly what's involved in getting started."
4,Good Info -- Poor Editing,I have read this book from cover to cover and found the information contained within to be very helpful and thorough. The book was up-to-date and provided interesting guidance on everything an aspiring wedding planner needs to know. I highly recommend the book for its educational content. The only disappointing aspect of the book was the poor editing. There was a typo on the first page and the subsequent chapters have noticeable errors. But the editing mistakes don't take away from the value of the content.
4,About the book:,"This book is about a girl who goes to England on a trip. On that trip she meets a boy that confuses her, and maybe teaches her something about herself. This is a very emotional book told from two different points of view."
2,more like a nightmare,"I bought this book based on the reviews, etc. I was very disappointed, it was slow and very boring. I even read ahead thinking it might get interesting, but it was more of the same. I finally stopped reading it."
5,A love story of the best kind,"Different in tone from her alarming psychological tales (Homework: A Novel, TThe Missing World: A Novel), this novel is a deceptively simple coming-of-age story set in Scotland in the early 1900s. Eva's mother dies giving birth to her and she is raised by her father and her practical Aunt Lily. Eva is a woman whose life is accompanied by invisible ""companions"" whose ""guidance"" is both helpful and harmful. Eva's relationship with them is colored by both humor and melancholy. This isn't a ghost story, but rather a love story of the best kind."
5,wonderful novel,I thought this book was absolutely wonderful. Once I started reading it..I wasn't able to put it down!
3,Eva Moves the Furniture,"Though I only gave this novel 3 stars, I would give it a 5 for writing as Margot Livesey clearly is a very talented writer. The story of Eva is a very engaging one. As we follow Eva through the years of her life, we get to see positive and negative influences that her two ""companions"" have on her. Who are these companions that only Eva can see and what is their purpose? I felt a slight disappointment with the story as I was waiting for some surprising twist that never happened. I also was never completely swept away by a mother/daughter bond theme. Despite this, the author's words are beautifully written, full of vivid imagery. Eva Moves the Furniture is entertaining and does raise some good questions to ponder about the after life and our guardian angels~"
3,"Interesting concept, but unsatisfying overall","I was moved to purchase this book because I love the name Eva, I was interested in the spiritual aspect of the story, and I am the mother of a daughter.Eva, the title character, is raised by her father and aunt after her mother dies shortly after her birth. She is also guided and influenced by two spirit visitors. These visitors shape her world; leading her in certain directions and away from people and interests they don't approve of. We aren't sure until the end who these visitors are and whether their intentions are in Eva's best interest.I was quickly pulled into the story and fascinated by the events taking place. I puzzled over the motivations of Eva's visitors. Unfortunately, I was still puzzled as the book ended. Or, rather, I was left wondering ""Is that all there is?"" I had expected a profound mission for her visitors, and I was disappointed."
4,One of a Kind!,"""Eva Moves the Furniture"" was my first book by Livesey, but I think I will look into her other ones. When Eva if born, the midwife notices 6 magpies and knows that Eva's mother will die. Eva grows up under her aunt and father's care. But there are two companions who truly look after her. No one can see them but Eva. And so begins a story about life with a twist of psychology.There were many times in this book where I had to stop and think when Eva's companions appeared. Where they just childhood characters that came from loneliness and lack of a mother? Or where they actually there to teach Eva what others could not? Take a look and form your own opinion, as well as reading a good book in the process."
3,It has potential but it squanders it,"At first this novel has a very spooky vibe with the ghosts following Eva around whereever she goes and the six black birds prophecising death. Even when the author abandons the scarier aspects and turns the companions into protecting spirits, there's still plenty of potential in this book. Eva's life goes through the Scottish childhood to the WWII hospitals and back to Scotland. The author does not skimp on details. It's very well written and a wonderful way to spend a few afternoons.However, when it's over the reader is left with a pretty book about a woman that doesn't really do much with her life and a few ghosts that only served to provide window dressing. It's definitely worth a read, but it's rather light and one forgets it almost as soon as one closes the book."
4,Eva's companions.,"This book is about Eva who is born on the day that her mother dies. She is raised by her father and Aunt Lily. All of her life, the companions are with her.....but she is the only one who sees them. The first part of the book was rather slow for me. It didn't hold my interest, but I'm glad I kept reading it. Eva has trouble in school making friends and fitting in. She tries to get jobs when she grows up, but sometimes the jobs don't work out. Were they ever meant to work out? How many of us have been lead down a certain road and don't know why.....till the outcome is realized by us. This is what this book is about. Eva tries to understand why the companions are with her. And I'm not even sure that is ever revealed. It tells the story of Eva growing up to become a woman and have a family of her own.......and the companions are right there with her all the time......coming and going at will. But they never leave her. This is an enjoyable book."
3,Rather unsatisfying,"Hmm. At first I liked it quite a bit, and thought the idea of the invisible companions was a good one. They could have done so much with that. However the whole thing was just kind of flat. Somehow it was engaging enough to keep me wanting to finish it and find out what happens.Unfortunately..not a whole lot happens. At least there is never any big plot twist or monumental event in it. I suppose the ending is a bit..but even then it just felt kind of flat and dull. I couldn't care too much about the characters, and the whole thing just left me feeling unsatisfied and a bit depressed. Maybe I just like happy endings I don't know, but if its going to have a sad one I want actually care about the character and by the ending I was ready to be done. Or maybe a little bit of uplift after the sad ending, perhaps if she'd come back to her daughter after. Hmm.Anyway it was okay but I wouldn't really recommend it."
3,Different kind of book,"I read this book for book club last month and we chose it because of it's catchy title. It was very difficult for me to get into, but it hooks you once Samuel comes into the picture. You realize the impact of the 'friends' during that time. I, at many times, felt the 'friends' were trying to lead her down the wrong path. But, at the end it clears itself up. The ending is good, but not as good as I was expecting. That was my first time to read one of her books, still debating on trying another one."
4,A Glorious Tear-jerker!,"After seeing a review for this book in PEOPLE magazine, I decided that it sounded like my kind of story. The reason I gave it 4 stars is I had to read about a quarter of the book before I became obsessed with it! (5 stars is when it grabs me during the first chapter). By the time I had read half of the book I was thinking about it all day at work--looking forward to going to bed early to see what was going to happen. Here is a warning though: Don't stay up too late to finish EVA MOVES THE FURNITURE because you will be so stopped up from crying that it will be impossible to sleep. I ended up loving this story."
3,A tough read if you're a parent,"This book is beautifully written, with characters that are really alive (even the dead ones) and a compelling story. So why only three stars? I loved it right up to about the last ten pages. I won't spoil the ending, but will only say that the book's final images are still in my nightmares. The book is beautiful and well crafted, but for many people, some books (Sophie's Choice, The Child in Time, etc) go on the embargo list during the early parenthood years. If you're one of those people, this book may not be for you."
5,One of My All-time Favorite Covers,"This book was assigned for a book group discussion and I put off reading it because it sounded weird. It is now on my list of all time favorites. The story was beautifully told and the ending was perfect, though very sad. Eva will stay with you long after you finish the book."
3,"A fast read, a good day for a weep","I read this book on a rainy, lazy Saturday. I wouldn't call it brilliant for a novel; in fact it had a short story feel. The novel itself up until the ending was a breezy read, easy on the brain. The last few pages were what is worth the purchase of this book. I just remember feeling this immense sadness at the end, so I re-read the ending again. It made me weep, a great-sobbing weeping that was ultimately very satisfying. I think the sadness comes from being a mother; however,I won't give away the ending."
3,As a Present,"I bought this for my taxidermist father for father's day. He liked that Tom Miranda hosted it, but he didn't find it too informative."
1,Gibraltar 9607NL Professional Noleg Hi Hat-Direct Pull,"Very bad product:The return of the hi hat back to open position after being depressed sucks... BADLY. For me it was unplayable so I returned it asap. There is no ""spring"" upwards in it (as in ""spring in your step"" lol). Once depressed, when you allow it to return to the open position it does not snap back, not at all, it feels as if it is not working properly making it difficult to play.Avoid this stand.. it does not work well at all.Hope this helps!"
1,More than Dreams OR More than LIES,"I would say watching this DVD was waste of time, same resources and potential you spent on backbiting ISLAM could have been spent on telling right side Christianty and great teachings of jesus.If you watch this DVD with a fair and honest brain, you will find how disgusting is this thought behind this DVD. I do not think this is putting Islam down in anyway or helping Christianity.Anyone with slight common sense can smell twisted facts mentioned in this DVD.I would say SIMPLY waste of my time, waste of resources to make this DVD and all characters seem really fake."
5,The best film I've ever seen,This is without a doubt the best film I've ever seen!! I laughed and cried through each of the stories that were told. What a blessing to see how God worked in these former Muslims hearts and led them to the way of salvation through Jesus Christ alone. This is one film that every Christian should see. It shows how God is concerned about each one of us personally and will work in our lives if we will allow Him to.I thought the acting was great and the film seems to be shot on site in each of the countries portrayed. I can't say enough good stuff about this film. Don't miss it! You definitely won't be sorry.
5,Victory at High Tide: The Inchon-Seoul Campaign (Great War Stories),"Specially requested by my son, a United States Marine, now serving in Iraq. He loved it."
2,Revised?,"We used this book for a recent trip to northern Italy (the Milan area) and found it to be unreliable: in several cases, it detailed restaurants that no longer existed, leading us to wonder just how much it had been revised. Still, it help us located a restaurant that was the favorite of our trip (though we cross-referenced it with another Italian travel guide and had our hotel clerk call to make sure it existed!)"
3,"now good, now bad","We have had some good experiences using this book as well as some indifferent ones. This is hardly Plotkin's fault since the quality of restaurants changes rapidly. What is less easy to overlook is that his notes appear to have been jumbled. Specialities of one trattoria in Turin, say, are assigned to another and vice-versa. So some of the details can get you a blank look or two from the staff and managers (though some of the busier places have been asked so many times about a dish P. recommends and which they have never actually had on their menu, they know immediately that you, like a hundred other Americans they've served that summer, are using the Plotkin book.) Besides why can't he just call swiss chard swiss chard instead of bietolo and carry on like it is something exotic. This doesn't inspire confidence in his knowledge of food, no matter how many cookbooks he may author in years to come."
2,.Disapointing,"It's big, clunky, but at the end of the day for each little town there is very little of information. It is too heavy to carry and in reality not that useful. Too bad"
3,Well-written and intentioned...,"This is a great idea for a book, and the author sometimes is surprisingly successful. But the problem is, it's too big a subject to handle in one book. Is there anyone on earth who can reliably inform you on which are the best restaurants, the best bakeries, the best cooking classes, the best salumerie, from tourist-infested Venice to the little towns that barely show up on the maps? Plotkin tries, but the answer is No.In numerous cases, we found places that were no longer in business or had changed their closing days. Some restaurants didn't look all that special, and we ended up having fine meals by eating at unrated places near by.Bottom line: we enjoyed the essays and benefited from two of the recommendations in this book, but ended up wasting time chasing after quite a few erroneous listings."
4,Fine book on Italian food,"A very comprehensive and well written book. Superbly researched. The only thing missing is that it would be nice to have some more detailed maps or a visual listing of all the recommendations, but other than that, it is an excellent book. Full of detail, accucrate and specific, it really helps you get into the finer grain of Italian food culture."
4,A great book for lovers of food and Italy,"The revised edition of Italy for the Gourmet Travel is a wonderful read, even if you're not planning an immediate trip to Italy. The explanations of the unique cuisine of each region are detailed and informative, and the suggestions of restaurants, cafes, markets and food shops to visit in each major city, town (and some in the countryside) are spot on. The selection of a ""highlight"" city or town in each region that excels as an example of the local cuisine is another great element. What makes the book such a pleasure though is the quality of the writing. My Italy-loving friends so much enjoyed dipping into it whenever they visited that I bought them their own copy."
1,NOT REVISED!!,"The description of this book says that it is ""revised,"" and, in fact, I happened to meet Mr. Plotkin by chance in Italy last summer, and he told me the book was being updated and revised. However, this is not a revised book. Though it is a 2010 edition, it names many many restaurants that are closed, and have been closed for years. So, if Mr. Plotkin is working on a revision, I say wait for that to be published. Restaurants DO change, but this edition of the book has not changed!"
2,Unfortunately dissapointing,"My wife and I have traveled to Italy for several years, and spend several weeks touring in an automobile. Unfortunately the book is dated enough that much of the information we used was no longer valid. Businesses moved, hours had changed. It was of some help, but it was not the reference material I had hoped.I wish it would be updated."
4,Fred Plotkin did good,"His reviews, from what I have experienced, are right on. I would recommed this book to a foodie who is going to be travelling to Italy."
3,"NOT a gourmet experience, but some decent meals.","I expected to experience wonderful taste sensations following the advice of this author. Some of the places recommended were just downright BAD FOOD! Also, lots of inaccuracies - incorrect addresses, wrong names of restaurants. Very frustrating. Worth a read for info on Italian food, but if you use it as your Bible you'll be disappointed. Fodor's recommends some better restaurants. This book seems to select decent dive/cheap restaurants that do serve decent food. And some of the restaurants which are supposed to be ""off the beaten path"" had English menus and many tourists, which is not what the book promised."
3,Wasn't compatible,"The item arrived promptly and appeared to be in fine condition, however this specific model did not work with the headset I already owned. This item needs much greater detail in its description, since it is not universally compatible with all GN-Netcom/Jabra headsets. After doing my own research (on the Jabra site) I discovered I needed either the 8050 or the 8210, which I ended up buying and works perfectly for my 2100 headset."
5,"Simple, effective conversion from 75mm to 100mm","I had a monitor arm I hadn't used in quite a while, and seem to have lost the 100mm VESA conversion plate it came with at some point, so it was stuck at the 75mm plate that was part of the arm itself. The monitor had 100mm hole placement.This was an effective and simple solution to the problem: I mounted this to the back of the monitor, mounted those in turn to the monitor arm, and now I have more desk space again.Manufacturing costs are probably considerably lower than the pricing, but still relatively reasonably priced considering it doesn't just come with the plate, but with the various screws and methods of securing it. Solidly constructed."
3,Converts the wrong way?,"I have the Ergotron WorkFit-S sit-stand workstation and a monitor with VESA 75mm mounting. The workstation is compatible with both VESA 75mm and 100mm monitors, but doesn't support the 75mm very well, and it won't let me swivel the monitor properly since the thumbscrews get in the way when they're in this configuration. Thus I purchased this kit, so I could attach my monitor's 75mm to the WorkFit's 100mm mount, where it would be more secure and adjustable.Unfortunately, this conversion kit seems to be designed only for mounting a 100mm monitor to a 75mm bracket - not the other way, and not the way that makes the WorkFit work properly. On the mounting plate, the 75mm-spaced holes are threaded, and the 100mm-spaced holes are large for a bolt to slide through. While the kit includes a variety of bolts and spacers, none of them fix the problem.I am very satisfied with my WorkFit so far, but this kit obviously was not meant to be an accessory for it."
4,Stunning poetry,"Yet another beautiful album from the amazing singer/songwriter. His lyrics and vocals are breathtaking. There are many great songs on this album, but, my personal favorite is ""accidental babies"". Chilling in its beauty, poignancy and poetry.I can't wait to see him in concert again... he gave the best concert I have ever been to in my life.I look forward to his music with bated breath!"
2,I really want to like this CD,"I think maybe I'm not hip enough to like this CD. I really want to like it. I've listened to it several times. I'm trying really hard to figure out what he's trying to say. Maybe I'm not deep enough. So many people are saying this is such a great CD and so much like his first one. Huh? I understood the first one. This one, not so much. I read the reviews trying to find out what I'm missing and still I don't get it. Maybe I should find the lyrics and then I'll understand what he's saying. I'm hoping it will grow on me and maybe '9 Crimes' is starting to, but the others not so much. Overall, a big disapointment."
3,Good effort - but kind of off....,"Not nearly as good as ""O""... but worth the purchase to keep in rotation."
3,Hard to top O the first album,"I really loved O so I purchased the second Album. I'm not sure what the need is for explicit lyrics. I'm not offended, it's just like a comedian swearing just to be funny - it isn't. I had to delete the song with the lyric ""she duz yoga....when she comes ovaaa...."" count on losing some fan base if you write a song containing the words ""she duz yoga"". I'm still a fan....."
4,'O' Revisited,"'9' is certainly the adopted sister of the must acclaimed predecessor 'O'..you could actually tag this onto the end and it would knit perfectly. Finely crafted songs such as 'Rootless Tree', 'Coconut Skins', 'Me, My Yoke and I' and 'Sleep, Don't Weep' underline Rice as a quality singer/songwriter of true substance..It is difficult to criticise Rice but the one minor criticism that I have with this album is that with a 3year gap between both albums, I did expect some diversity. That being said, it is still being played continuously on my ipod, and each song stands on it's own which unfortunately cannot be said of many of the albums being churned out these days..."
5,This is pure genius,"This album is nothing short of genius, and its even better than O. Listen carefully and play it the whole way through and you will realise that. Its more heart-felt, more intense, its stronger, its sexier, its angrier, its darker and its more varied. There are some tracks on O where I feel he drones on a bit. Not on 9. I am grabbed by virtually all of the songs. For me, the stand out tracks are Rootless Tree and Accidental Babies. I saw Damien Rice play most of this album live at Radio City in New York and he was simply unbelievable. If you get the chance, do not hesitate to see this man live. The emotion was pouring out of him. Go buy this album."
3,Struggles against stagnation,Rice struggles to repeat the success of his breakout O but comes up short in a satisfyingly predictable yarn that wears out a formula previously rendered potent.
4,"Not quite O, but definitely a keeper","I must say that I miss some of Damien Rice's hissing anger that burst forth from a whisper that was featured prominently on the album O. This album replaces that calous anger with a dark bleakness. Where O was put together beautifully and carefully, some songs on 9 seem as though they were put together in a dash, which is odd for an album which took so long to come out. I have been very satisfied with the album as a whole and for a sophomore effort Rice has produced a solid album."
4,Good Performer...,"Damien Rice has a cool and smooth sound. Very acoustic and simple, but clean. This album is very good. It doesn't have as many good songs on it as the ""o"" album, but still very good. It's worth getting."
3,Be Aware this has an applied Label...My new Dell Inspirion will not load,Be Aware...some Cd's now have attached label on the Cd. My new Dell Inspiron will not open and load these CD. Could not use this CC...gave it away.
2,Hm,"I like the melody of this album.. but the lyrics are really awful. I thought O was a great album, but this one is just not that good. Remember, this is just my opinion of his album. Some people may find his lyrics in his album powerful, but i didn't feel that way for most of the songs."
2,I'm sure i'm not making any friends with this review.,"This album, to me, is every bit as throughly unimpressive as everything else this man has done. Call me crazy, but I only consider someone a 'great songwriter' (and I've seen the label pinned on Mr. Rice a time or two) after they've written GREAT SONGS. In the case of the artist in question, I can't name a single one (his best-crafted tune, in my opinion, being ""The Professor & La Fille Danse"" from his b-sides release). I would call nearly everything in his existing catalog mediocre, at best. So, I guess you can all start hating me now."
5,Pure Emotional Ecstasy,"I never tire of this album. It cuts to the core. 9 Crimes is probably the most dark, depressing song I have ever heard, but in a way that most can relate to. I just wish Damien Rice share all of his unreleased material, which contains enough songs for multiple albums, some of which is his best work (ex. ""Bottom Shelf"")."
4,I love Damien Rice's style,I'm just as happy with this CD as I am with his first one. I play bothof them all of the time. It's very easy and enjoyable to sing along with it.
4,Great Follow-Up Album,"As much as I liked ""O"" (The movie ""Closer"" and Natalie Portman will always be associated with ""The Blowers Daughter""), I think this album built and improved upon his debut. The opening song ""9 Crimes"" is wonderful and eerie and the melody has a haunting effect that frames the album perfectly. I also loved the songs ""Dogs"" and ""Coconut Skins."" What I think makes this album so refreshing is the way that Rice has made the chorus matter again. I've found that music in recent years has suffered from a long-standing want for choruses that aren't nonsense and superficial gunk. I wish I could say more about why this album is so good, but you'll have to listen for yourself. It's well worth the money, especially for fans of Alexi Murdoch, Badly Drawn Boy, and David Grey."
3,Damien Needs a Pint of Rocky Road,"When I feel really bad -- I mean really, really bad -- I reach for a pint of Rocky Road ice cream.I think Damien reached for his guitar.While I loved ""0"", I found ""9"" dark to the point of soperific. Even after repeated listenings, I didn't really find any track that caught my attention and swept me in or made me laugh or cry.I'm all for making space for artists to explore all sides of their art, but I think we all have to be honest in recognizing when the dessert was a little under-cooked."
3,DO NOT LISTEN TO THIS CD IF YOU ARE DEPRESSED!,"Unless of course you want to delve deeper into depression. You have been warned!To be quite honest with you, this CD didn't live up to my expecatations. There are some hauntingly beautiful songs on here, but as a whole, it's missing something...doesn't quite flow. It's not all bad though: I love Damien's voice and his collaboration with Lisa Hannigan - they sound absolutely great together.So, if I had to listen to this or some other folksy singer like, let's say, James Blunt, then I'd listen to this hands down...even if I was depressed as h*ll. Even though 9 doesn't live up to its predecessor, it's still better than 90% of the garbage out there.Peace out."
5,Damian Rice is unmatched,I have fallen in Love with Damian Rice's CD called 9 and have recorded it for many of my family members as gifts!
3,Album is fine; his concerts are not,"How can Damien Rice have the audacity to present a show (and charge ""fans"" for it) without Lisa Hannigan on vocal and Vyvienne Long on cello? What an ego- / male-centric attitude! I just attended the Wash., DC DAR Constitution Hall show, and I want my money back. Furhter, I encourage anyone who has tickets to future shows to dump them now. He's missing the boat if he thinks his music is that good without them."
4,This is a cool DVD - Buy it!,"I loved this DVD. It's very campy. Some might say its so bad its good. You've got to check out Screaming Lord Sutch. This guy is nuts. Before there was Kiss or Marylin Manson, their was Screaming Lord Sutch. Rock and Roll meets the Haunted Mansion. And by the way, is that Ritchie Blackmore playing the guitar for Lord Sutch? They give you a brief glimpse of the lead guitar player. It looks like a young Ritchie Blackmore; I know he played for Lord Sutch early in his career. Lord Sutch also has a stripper in his act that I enjoyed. I also loved the interview with Little Richard. He's nuts too. I love his quote ""It's not the size of the boat that makes you seasick; its the waves in the ocean"". Right on, Richard. Also check out Jerry Lee Lewis pounding that piano. The Killer lives! The quality of this DVD is not up to todays standards, but still, you have to have this one in your collection."
1,Nostalgia purposes only,"The London Rock & Roll ShowBuy this DVD for historical purposes or if you are feeling a bit nostalgic...but never, ever, buy it for the substandard and badly performed music."
2,Bad bad bad...,"Piers makes the point in the intros for several of these stories that they were rejected over and over or never even accepted for publication. Well, they should have stayed that way. This is a collection of desperate amateurish stories that would have been better left alone."
2,You won't get no satisfaction,"I really tried to get into this novel, being a big Waugh fan. And while I have respect for Mount's writing style, this novel basically stinks. The characters are pretty obtuse, and there are too many of them and they run together...sort of like Brideshead Revisited, except these characters aren't interesting or charming. The just have eccentric names. Due to its far-flung locations and bizarre characters, this novel should be far more exciting than it is. Overall, much like the hero, a reader can't get no satisfaction."
2,Disappointment,A disappointment compared to first two parts. The original cast seemed so much more appropriate for the parts and did a much better job.
4,A great book,"This is a great book! Professor Holland used his book in a course he taught at Allegheny College in PA. A must have book for Biblical Scholars. It is NOT light reading, but is very interesting."
5,Happy as a Lark,I'm quite pleased with the price and delivery time of this. Thaks very much. I would recommend it to others.
3,"Okay for recipes, but lacks basic user information","I was hoping for more basic information on pressure cooking. Aside from a brief history, a couple paragraphs of simple ""how-to's"" and a few Q & A's, there is precious little information to help the novice with using this device. Unless you are totally familiar with how to use a pressure cooker, and simply want to add to your recipe book collection, do not get this book. For complete pressure cooker instruction, put your money toward ""Pressure Cookers for Dummies""...a much more comprehensive tutorial written in easy to understand language, which makes no assumptions at all regarding the reader's level of knowledge. Pressure Cookers for Dummies helps to eliminate the ""trial by error"" learning curve. As an added bonus, ""Pressure Cookers for Dummies"" also has great recipes.UPDATE: Now that Miss Vickie's Big Book of Pressure Cooking has come out, I recommend that as well. If you can afford only one, Miss Vickie's would be the better choice."
3,It helps.,"I find this some what of a middle of the road cookbook. It helps, I am not sure I would buy it again.Fancy recipes that maybe make a pressure cooker more work rather then less."
1,Orricial Presto Pressure Cooker Cookbook,"Recipes are NOT family friendly.Eg, who wants to eat ""rabbit with stewed prunes??""I was very disappoionted in the book, and I do not recommend it, especially if you are cooking for children/teens."
1,Fire truck bedding,"I just received the bedding today and am quite disappointed in the product. It is a thin material, there are strings hanging in numerous places, and the fire trucks appear much more cartoonish than in the posted picture. I thought there were supposed to resemble antique looking firetrucks, but that is not the case at all. I plan to return this product."
4,The Funk Genius Returns,"It is just hard to believe how much music is just the id of manufactured feelings these days. Yet, with all that hype in costumes and the actual simplicity of music, there is no feel and rhythm now. When Prince came back recently, he brought a magnificent sense of old school R&B to the game again. It is the first time he has released a single, since his public symbol and his feud with Warner Brothers expired. Arguably, he hasn't lost a step, as many people thought. With Musicology, his first single, from the exactly same titled record, he truly brings out the feel of Soul and Earthy, classic R&B to the mainstream. The song is very upbeat, and is a remarkable reintroduction to one of the most influential artists of the late 70's and 80's. If this song is so wonderful on the charts, I can't wait until the albums next single, whenever that'll be. Nevertheless, it is a guilty pleasure that is wonderful to escape into."
3,B/W art reproductions?,"The book is no doubt fabulous. The research, quality of the reproductions and text, layout -- it leaves nothing to wish for. But what I found rather upsetting was that many of the reproductions, especially from the Tahitian period, are in black-and-white. Gorgeous, lush, luminous color reproduced in black and white? This is unbelievably disappointing, and I would not have bought the book if I had known this ahead of time."
2,"Loved this game when it first came out, not so much now.","I remember LOVING this game when it first came out, especially because it seemed you could run the ball more successfully then in the newer ones. I lost the game a while ago, and got into the newer madden games since. I decided to buy this just for old times sake, and I didn't remember the graphics being so TERRIBLE! i mean I know its an older game, but its still a 360 game. I guess you could blame my memory on the fact that I was in my drug phase during college when it came out, but wow, i would highly suggest not getting this unless you are a diehard fan. I played it once and tossed it aside."
3,Unreal,"I was playing a franchise with the 49ers and threw picks left and right. Even when alternating the quarterbacks I was throwing 60 or 70 times a game. The running back fumbles a lot on 15 minute quarters. I put it on 15 minute quarters to give me enough time to come from behind. This is based on stats going into the 2007 season. Overall, at 15 minute quarters you get unrealistic gameplay, as I was allowing opposing quarterbacks to throw for as much as 500 yards on me. My running game was getting in excess of 200 yards a game. Overall, a decent game but too unrealistic when using 15 minute quarters."
4,nice!,"finally a very good game for the 360 that rivals '05 for regular xbox (my favorite madden.. but this might top it). Gone is the choppiness (for the most part) and the horrible cut-scenes to a black tunnel or the back of a scoreboard or whatever. Personally, I don't care about the radio-announcer. Madden was totally annoying too. Yeah, I agree, they could improve here but the game is near flawless where it counts: gameplay, graphics and presentation. The new animations are great and I dig the realism: you have to think and strategize with this game, unlike any other Madden.Gripes are few.. personally, I don't like playing in the rain because the mud just looks fake and distracts from the players. Also, why can't we save a game mid-game? Previous Maddens allowed this.Overall, love it. I was so harsh and critical of 06 and 07 that I never thought I'd enjoy another Madden.. well, here is a vast improvement!"
5,Best madden 08 out there!,"This Madden NFL 08 is, to me, everything that made it great. It has so many features, it can keep even the most dedicated game entertained for weeks with all the possbilities. I played both the PS3 and 360 versions, and the 360 is the only way to go. The PS3 version was slow, glitchy, locked up, and the graphics just looked inferior to the 360 version. I strongly recommend that you get this game on the 360 version if you can. It's a lot better on the 360 than anything else. About the gameplay, haven't you ever wanted to take your fav team, add a few players of your own that look like giants on the defensive line, and go and sack the quarterback? How about making your own quarerback, and receivers, and pasting the team you dislike the most by 60 points? Yep, you can do it here, and it's a whole load of fun. Get this one for the 360, it's a lot better than any other one out there."
1,This game Sucks worse than any game I've ever played,"The only reason I gave it one star was because there was no option for 0 stars. It took all that was bad from Madden 07 and made it worse. Good luck playing on superstar mode. You can't see anything when you throw the ball, so it's totally up for grabs. I also hope you have the hand-eye cordination of the world's most elite assassin to be able to do the rookie workouts they set for you. If you want to play a good football game play NCAA 08, I thought it was pretty good. Madden has successfully turned the once great tradition of NFL football games into an unbearable waste of time, money, and plastic."
1,360 version worse than regular xbox version,"Why does EA insist on creating stripped down versions of supposedly ""next generation"" games. This game lacks many of my favorite features.No coach mode!No computer controlled games. You have to have a user control one team, and because you can't do coach mode, and because the QB will NOT throw the ball on his own, you have to throw the ball youself. So your QB will only be as good as you are.No historic teams.You can't create players in franchise mode.There are fewer created team logos and color options.Lame radio announcers.To make things worse, the regular xbox Madden games are not backward compatible on the xbox 360. You're better off playing it on an xbox."
2,Please give 2k its rights back...,"The Madden on the psp is better than the 360 for the second year in the row. Its unbelieveable that precision passers throw 2-5 a game in 08 for 360. This game is not offense minded at all. Randy Moss, Lavereneus Coles and even Devin Hester can be caught up in this game. Its a d@mn shame. This game looks great though, But until Madden relases its stranglehold on the NFL rights and have some competition, these are going to be some lean years for EA."
1,Game freezes constantly,"I think it's important for everyone to know that this game freezes constantly. Franchise mode does not work for more than 1 season. EA does not have a patch for these fixes yet. Buyer beware, especially if this is a holiday gift.This game is essentially all looks, no substance."
5,Madden is back!,"So last years madden sucked, plain and simple. I bought it and played it maybe 5 times. So my neighbor picked up 08' yesterday, and I stopped by to test the waters. Needless to say Madden is back. First off you'll notice it's animations are awesome. Grahics are great, and there are so many upgrades. What really makes the difference is the speed of the game. It's fast! It feels like the good old maddens of old. Your flying around, like a real game. Plus the control of the players is great. No more trying to go one way and you go the other. I went out immediately and bought my copy. The 360 version si the way to go."
5,Madden NFL 08,"This game was great. Once you find your plays it allows you to dominate and I love all the audible options.Things I did not like. The multiplayer play select allows you to see exactly what play the other player picked. Also when you save your file, the game loops the message asking you to save even if you already have, it happens until you just cancel it out."
5,impressing a tough customer,WOW!!! this game is awesome I havent bought a madden game since 2005 I thought I'd try this years version to see if it was any good. This game is great franchise mode and superstar mode are a ton of fun. The graphics are amazing the player descriptions are almost perfect and the gameplay is as good as any other football game that will be made this year. You owe it to yourself to just try this game out i did and i absolutley loved it!
1,another huge piece crap,ok the 360 maddens have been hard turds so heres why06 AI was stupid and game was slow and boring07 it was better but i would rather play with my a##08 i was happy thil it started freezing up in year 2 or franchize so don't buy ea's crap fest that is madden
3,not to bad,i think they could do a little more better with graphics on it.I bought it from someone on amazon and it came in a aftermarket case where the instruction booklet was stuffed inside there it doesnt even fit
3,This is supposed to be next gen?,"The graphics were comparable to my PS2 and the player movements are ""robotic-like"". The side-line graphics are pitiful, with several players on the sidelines moving in sync. As often as they show the sideline, that just shouldn't be. Not much effort put into Madden 08, but it is Madden, meaning its still somewhat fun. Although, I'd rather play Madden 05 for my PS2, it looks about the same and plays much better! Hopefully 09 has major graphics improvements to make me feel like I'm actually playing a ""Next Gen"" game! I didn't spend money for a Xbox 360 to play PS2 looking games on it!"
2,too many glitches,I bought game a couple of days ago and was impressed with the gameplay and the grafics in exhibition mode but once i began franchise mode it all went down hill. along with managing rosters there were minor freezes where i played around with the button and reconnected the controller and some how got it to work but by the time i made it to year 2 the game froze in before i could get the opening kickoff. Extremly upset did research online to find out about tons of glitches and complaints and ea removing such complaints from thier forums. the only good news is the are releasing patches the bad is that the patches have bugs as well meaning i wasted 60 buck don't buy.
3,Wrong Endzone,"We all know new Madden, same problems. It's true that Madden is always three years behind itself and having a tough time catching up. The graphics are where they should be, but in other areas it struggles. There are so many bugs and glitches (this is what game testers are for). The rosters and player numbers are wrong and it makes you wonder if Madden should of waited for the start of regular season. Updates? You might not see an update for a while and it will be called ""Madden 09"". The weapons system takes the fun out of the game and I hardly or never use it. Madden puts new old features back in that were missing in the previous version. Yes, same old voice over announcer that we could all live without...I would rather play in silence then listen to him."
4,Camera veiws,"My only complaint is that I can't pull the camera back to be farther away from the field. I like to play cornerback, and it's hard when you can't see what you're doing until the ball is in the air. I hold the trigger back until the snap, but then the camera zooms back in automatically.If anyone knows how to do this, i might just be stupid, so feel free to let me know."
4,Nice football game before the NFL season starts,"Madden 08 is nice to play until the actual NFL season starts up again. Overall, the graphics is a marked improvement from last seaon's (Madden 2007). I guess the only grumble is why are they still using some generic radio voice guy for the play by play. You don't even hear the trademarked Madden one-liners anymore, like the previous versions of Madden games back in the early days."
1,unintelligible answering machine,"The sound quality of the handset is mediocre at best, and the answering machine playback is completely unintelligible. I'm on Amazon today to check out new systems after having this one for only three months. Whatever I buy next will definitely not be a Vtech, as my husband has also had terrible experiences with the brand."
2,Not a keeper.,"This just didn't work with my body chemistry. I am sure it would with some people, but just not me. It didn't work well on my daughter either. She said ""it smells like bug spray"" to her."
2,Arrived Quickly,Item arrived very quickly I bought samples soI could try them out. Would not purchase this particular fragrance again. too strong too old lady smelling.
4,Its good,I liked that perfume however my wife like Gucci Flora more than this.Thought its a nice option to test the fragrance before buying the big bottle.
4,Gucci Accenti,"I like this product, wish it came in larger vials. I did have a problem with NMore shops. I ordered 6 vials and only received 1. I contacted them to complain and they had said there was a computer glitch they had to deal with that now was resolved. Well, it wasn't. I again had to contact them. I have now received all many weeks later. I would have thought with the vials sooo small they would have thrown in an extra for my troubles, but no chance, at least I like the product and have them now."
4,It works!,I really like this product. I tried a sample that my Mom had given me and decided to buy it. I have naturally dark circles under my eyes and they are worse if I don't get enough sleep. This serum actually reduces the darkness and once I get makeup on they look much better than they used to. I would recommend trying it.
2,"Moisturizes, feels nice, but no difference in dark circles","After buying this, further research has led me to the same conclusion with every one of these dark circle serums and creams: Not a single one works consistently!For however many people that have noticed a huge improvement, there are just as many that have seen no change at all. This applies to both the cheap AND pricey stuff.This one is nice enough as a moisturizer, but don't expect miracles. My raccoon eyes are still here after religious daily use for quite a while.For very dark genetic circles like mine, the best advice I've come across is this:1. See a dermatologist. S/he may recommend laser surgery to thicken the skin under your eyes.and/or2. See a makeup artist. With help in choosing the correct shades of concealer and color corrector for your skin tone, you should see a noticeable difference.Don't waste your money on serums. Good luck!"
2,well i wanted to like it,i gave this product about 3 months and didnt really see a differencesorry nice transaction went smoothly
1,A Great Let Down!,"I purchased this back in August 2010 and used it weekly. To this day, it still has not improved the dark circles. The liquid seems a bit thin and watery in my opinion; almost like you're slathering on some cheap hand cream from the dollar store. This product was a waste of money for me and I definitely would not recommend it to anyone."
2,Mediocre,I was excited to try this product and with the price being cheap I thought I should give it a try. I've tried Civant Skincare and Murad under eye creams with no noticeable effects. I put this on and after the first few days there seemed to be a small improvement but after that it stopped working. Overall it was a disappointing experience>
2,370z owners beware,I have a 370z with rays wheels on them. These do NOT fit. You have to get mag lock wheel not acorn. Plus you need washers.
3,Provides Extra Background For Lovers of the Game,"This is going to be a pretty simple and easy review.The 7th Guest novel is not the best work of literary fiction in the world. However, for people who love the original game The 7th Guest, this retelling provided character details and additional story background that make it a must read. I highly recommend it for those who grew up with and loved The 7th Guest but, not for the casual fiction reader."
3,Not Very Good,I found this book to be all right but it was poorly written. The book seemed too short and rushed. The word usage was terrible making me believe that the author is not much of a talent. The only thing that interested me about it was that I played and enjoyed the game and the book refreshed the story for me. I do not recommend this for anyone unless they enjoyed the game.
5,does the job,not much to say about the product other than it does what it's suppose to do. installed in a 2011 jeep grand cherokee laredo
3,Doesn't fit Dodge,"I ordered this item when I replace the factory radio in my 2011 Dodge Ram and it didn't fit properly, ended up modifying the part to get it to work."
1,Warning - May not be correct part,"I recently ordered this part from Amazon, but instead I ended up getting the totally opposite adapter. Instead I received the male connector (which is not even shown as being available individually here)."
2,two day shipping?,Well maybe I should wait to receive the item but I ordered it two days ago and it should have been here by now....I may come back and change this review but I'll have to wait and see how it goes...so far no good!!!
1,Said it would fit... Didn't,"It looks to be made of quality materials and all, but it said it would fit my '07 Impala, but it doesn't. Gonna have to return it."
2,Doesn't fit 2012 Jeep Wrangler,"Though listed at fitting 2002 on up Chrysler and Jeep products, this adapter doesn't fit my factory antenna wiring harness -- it appears the center contact is far to big, and the outer shell is the exact same size as the mating connection, both of which preclude any fit from occurring.It does appear to be a well-made adapter, but is mislabeled as to which cars it fits."
5,a must,This is needed to hook up any after market radio to a Chrysler Jeep for Dodge. This one is the right size and fits good.
2,Disappointing,I bought this book because I thought it would help me indentify unknown vegetables and other ingredients in the Asian Food Market. There are no color photographs and only a few black and white photos of some ingredients. Don't waste your money as I did.
2,"Emotional, but not factual","I have read several books about MCS and EI. This book if full of emotional ramblings rather than solid facts. If you are doing research, I would not consider this a good source. If you are looking for someone to feel your pain and share your anger at environmental illness, this book may comfort you. Understand that some of the things he says are not 100% true. If you want more factual information, try Dr. Doris Rapp or Dr. Sherry Rogers. Their books have citations linked to actual studies and court cases as well as helpful information on how to heal yourself."
3,It explains a lot if your new to MCS .,It explains a lot if your new to MCS but not very helpful for people who have had it for years
5,Beautiful book for a beautiful holyday!,"Very informative and well written (as usual from Amber and Azrael!) This is one of the books from the series covering the Wheel of the Year quarter and cross quarter holidays. I like them all, but this is probably my favorite...but then, I am partial to Brigid. Highly recommended!"
4,Looking Glass--3 stars; Bug's Life--5 stars,"In ""Through the Looking Glass,"" the pregnant Moya attempts to starburst prematurely, thereby lodging herself in the interdimensional space that is crossed instantaneously during a normal passage. Crichton (Ben Browder) must coordinate efforts in four distinctive and coexisting environments in order to save the day. A substandard episode.""A Bug's Life"" has a cliche premise (who is harboring the body-snatching alien invader?), but redeems itself with exceptional plotting and direction. This episode generates more tension than one would expect from series television."
5,Fantastic Series,All the DVDs are in great shape and all features worked fine. I have been waiting a long time to get this series and I am very happy with my purchase.
1,Not the best!,"I love Baby Einstein books but this one was not that good, I think there are better ""bed time"" books out there. Go to a nearest book store, read it first before you buy this."
1,Worst book in our collection,"Other reviewers seem to like this book, but I can't imagine why. It is too wordy and boring for little ones, and too short for older kids. The illustrations look like they just tried to maximize clutter in Photoshop: ""This poem is about snowflakes... we'll paste a snowy tree scene and as many snowflakes as possible on to this page."" Mimi and her mom look like possessed construction paper cutouts of monkeys.In short, there's nothing really imaginative about this book. It's a bedtime book about a mother putting her child to bed. You get unimaginative poems about snowflakes, a carousel, a meadow, puppies, mice, and the night sky.Read it before you buy it - I'm sure it appeals to someone... after all, it IS Disney. But we are more of a Dr. Seuss and Sandra Boynton crew - kids books should be fun and creative."
4,Cute,Cute book and good illustrations. My 9 month old baby likes the bright colors and illustrations.
1,Don't waste your money,"I would give it zero stars if that was allowerd. Piece of junk. The first time water hit the speaker the volume became so low it was inaudible. Hours later that night the volume was back, but again a simple handful of water to the speaker rendered it useless for the next hour or so."
3,Fairly good once you know hoe to use it!,This shower radio was tricky at first to use. I thought the batteries were failing until I realized that water was blocking the speaker and I couldn't hear the radio! Now I know to keep the water spray away from the radio and it works fine.Otherwise you can easily dry the speaker off with a towel and taa-daa! You can hear the speaker again! Good product. I use rechargeable batteries in it and they have lasted a long time. The CD player is great too---can't open the CD player while it is wet though. So you need to plan to put your CD in while it is dry.Uses 'AA' batteries which are more convenient than 'C' batteries which others use.
5,Fantastic Hemp Shampoo!,"I currently use both the HEMP Hydrating shampoo, and the Hydrating conditioner. They smell so so good, and they make my hair feel healthy. Before using almost every hair had a split end, I have only a few split ends now."
4,No problems,Item was as advertised and arrived timely. I would use this vendor again as this product cannot be found locally.
3,Not good for those with skin allergies,I once got a shampoo called Hempz and came across this in a store to see if it would be as good. The hempz brand was the only scented product I've been able to use. But Hemp (without the Z) caused me to itch wherever it ran over me.
3,Only part of The Long Halloween,"Buyer beware. I bought this because I wanted to buy ""The Long Halloween"" and figured why not get it packaged with two other stories. This only has the beginning of the Long Halloween story. I should have paid closer attention, but I would not have purchased if I knew that. The price I paid wasn't bad though and The Man Who Falls is a nice short comic."
2,Piece of junk,"The sound quality is usually OK, but at random intervals I get sudden, loud static that drowns out the conversation. I'd think it was interference except my other 900MHz phone (a Panasonic) isn't affected.The ringer is so incredibly awful that I turned it off and plugged my old corded phone in just so I wouldn't have to listen to it anymore. The ringer is extremely loud and cannot be adjusted.Caller ID is bizarre, becasue the order of calls on the phone is completely different than the order of incoming calls. Plus the time-stamps are always wrong, both on caller ID and on answering machine messages.The call-back feature for caller ID simply doesn't work for long-distance numbers-- because the phone will not dial ""1"" before dialing.This phone stinks. I'm sorry I got it and I'll be replacing it soon."
3,Its ok....For awhile,It was a pretty good phone for awhile. I think ive had it for a lil less then 6 months and already the bottons on it are HORRIBLE! i cant even hang up the phone let alone dial one number! Overall it was ok. No static. And the answering machine was fine. Just those bottoms!
4,good basic phone,I find this phone to be good and easy to use. I have nothing bad to say. My calls are clear and volume is good.
2,Button Problems,"I too am having button problems. The 2 and 3 buttons have to be pushed insanely hard to get them to work. Other than that, I have been happy with the phone, but I am writing this review because I am shopping for a new phone because my wife is tired of building up her strength to dial."
3,Button Problems,"Phone itself (reception, sound, answering machine, etc) works great, but the buttons stick and then fall off. I see from the reviews I am not the only one with this problem. I am in this site now to look for phones as I am now missing my #1, #3, and talk buttons. E-mailed GE to see the price of a new handset and got a useless response telling me to call some long distance number?! Off to buy a phone!"
1,Terrible product - don't waste your money,"This phone has two MAJOR problems.First, the buttons become unresponsive and hard to press after a short period of time. We only had this phone for a few months before it became very hard to press the numbers, particularly the most-used numbers of our area code. It is now practically impossible to press the 2 button, and when you mash the 2 button with all your might, it then dials several 2's.Second, after hanging up from a phone call or a misdialed call (see problem #1), you cannot immediately make another call. The phone simply will not give you another dial tone unless it has been ""off"" for a considerable period of time. This is unacceptable.We are shopping for a better phone. Shame on GE for putting out such a bad product."
2,Buyers beware!,"This is a decent phone and answering system for about the first year, then two major problems start. If you have cell phones, charging them anywhere close to this phone will cause these problems to appear sooner than normal.Buttons stick making it very hard to dial a number.A clear conversation might be interrupted by ""electronic noise."""
1,Buttons only last 7 months,"I purchased this unit in September. The number 3 button has to be pressed so hard in order to dial! I have had this same problem with other brands of cordless phones. My sister also has had this problem. Sometimes its the talk button, or one of the number buttons. I have contacted the board of directors at GE in Fairfield CT regarding this."
3,Handset disconnects,"I love GE phones because I find them easy to use. The answering machine on this phone worked great. However I couldn't get the handset to work. I charged the battery for at least 24 hours. From about day two I could not place outgoing calls. After I dialed I would hear the ring tone as if it were calling out, and then it would disconnect (presumably when the other person picked up the phone). Then after about a week, I couldn't answer incoming calls either because the phone would disconnect. Very frustrating."
1,Horrible Phone,I came here to give my review of this product (because I was displeased enough to take action) and was surprised to see that the other reviews echoed my exact complaints.We've had this phone for almost a year and we're replacing it because the buttons don't work dependably anymore. I've missed phone calls because the talk button wouldn't work when I pressed it.On top of the button issue the battery life is feeble. This phone only holds a charge for a day or so.
5,Excellent,"A spectacular underrated CD. Good grief, don't give 1 star to an artist because the shipping company messed you up! How stupid is that? Use your spell checker next time too doofus.This CD is fantastic. Every song will catch you and take you on a trip hop, jazzy groove ride that you just can't quit. This CD stays in my rotation."
5,This book should be on every IIS administrators desk,"I have 3 words for any IIS 6 Administrator. Buy This Book! This is great day to day reference manual for anyone that works with IIS 6. The author trimmed the fat that you find in most other computer books you find and gets right to the heart of the matter. This makes it an excellent reference book, but not the best for learning about IIS Administration. While this book would help the IIS 4 or 5 administrator get up and running on IIS6, I would recommend that someone without any experience with IIS purchase another title to learn about IIS, then purchase this book for your day to day reference."
3,dinnerware,"The colors are a little washed out. They are not as bright as they look on line. Some of the plates are not flat. They look like a warped record. Otherwise, the set is pretty for spring but i can't see using this in fall or winter."
2,Get something better...,"If you prune only a few branches a year, this may be adequate. Anything more, you will be screaming with each use. The cutting mechanism gets jammed with each pull of the rope. The saw blade attachment is not very sharp, and it takes forever to cut a small limb. The pole is too whippy and difficult to control. Get something better for your arms' sake."
2,Doesn't work for soft material,"I was looking for a collapsible pruner for trimming some pine trees. I currently use a pruner with a solid wooden pole. The collapsible pole works fine but the cutting head is useless for soft material. Most cutting heads are anvil or scissor types. The Fiskars cutting head is neither. The blade goes into a slot that is about 3/8 inch wide. When cutting soft material, like the new growth on a pine tree, it gets smashed into the groove and is not cut.I took the Fiskars head off and remounted the head from my old pruner (> 50 years old and made of steel with a scissor-type cut), after a little work on my wood-turning lathe to make a transition piece. It works fine now, although the Fiskar pole is a little heavier than I would have liked."
1,"If you research this mouse before making a deicsion, you won't buy it","When I picked up this mouse, I believed it would be a good buy based on my past experience with the Microsoft Optical Wheel Mouse (with cord). That mouse, btw is a great buy and has lasted me a long time.That said, I longed for a cordless mouse. This mouse worked excellently for the first 2 weeks I had it. Then one night while playing a game, it simply stopped. The cursor wouldn't budge. I tried reseting the channels (hold down button on the base receiver and bottom of the mouse itself) I also changed the batteries and reinstalled software. Having a mouse fail this quickly makes me suspect a larger problem, which is confirmed by many other respected product review websites online.Before you invest your hard earned money on this mouse, I'd strongly caution you to take a closer look at reviews."
2,NOT good for use with laptops,"The receiver for this mouse is almost as big as the mouse itself and is connected to a long cord, making it pointless for use with a laptop. I wish Amazon had a picture that showed the receiver... if they had, I would not have ordered this mouse."
2,This Cable Has No String,"I called the manufacturer, Cables To Go, and was told that the cable DID have the cut string used to cut down the PVC so as not to nick the wires with cutters. I order two boxes of 500'. When they showed up neither contained the string. Unfortunately I did not have time to return the cable and had to use it on a project anyway."
1,The parts sent do not fit.,"Apparently there is a glitch in your compatibility checker, because the rotors are too small for my vehicle.2006 XJ8."
2,Short Talk time... plus static sounds,"I bought two units of this model. One from Amazon. Expected the first unit to be promising but yes, the talk time is too short. What can you expect from a 300mAh battery? So, I replaced it with a 600mAh battery and so far it's working fine. My second unit gives a static sound despite changing the channels. Sigh. Is this replaceable?"
1,a real cheap clunker from vtech,"okay, i wasnt expecting much when i bought this bad boy. i just wanted a phone for my bedroom that looked cool, had decent range, and was of sound quality. there are no bells and whistles with this phone, but thats fine, i didnt need any. well lo and behold, after i charged this baby up for the required amount (12 hours) and plugged in my phone line, it was ready to roll. then i pick up the phone, im able to hear the dial tone, and im also able to hear this incessant ticking sound. like TICK, TICK, TICK.. about every second. i could time the jeopardy theme song with 30 of these annoying ticks. so i place a call, and while the ticking sound has been muted somewhat, ITS STILL THERE. tick, tick, tick. ahhh!! HELP! i took this pice of junk back ASAP. this phone really TICKED ME OFF! no pun inteneded. (okay, maybe a little pun intended.)"
1,You get what you pay for,"The only problem I've had with this phone is the complaint listed most frequently among other user reviews - crap battery life. Reception's fine, no clicking, etc. on the ones I bought (got one for my girlfriend too), but the battery life is for total garbage. Talk more than ten minutes or so, and it goes dead. Leave it off the handset overnight, and it goes dead. A replacement battery costs more than the phone, and I don't think it matters - the batteries just plain suck. Someone wrote something about 300Amphs or something, so maybe that's something to look out for when buying a new phone, because you'll have to after this one drives you up the wall. I think electornics manufacturers are all engaged in a big conspiracy to sell new batteries at outrageous prices (there's no uniformity, so you're stuck with the maker's models). Give me some hunker phone that works on double AAs."
1,NOT WORTH a 1 Star Rating,"This phone is pure garbage. Although there is a volume control on the receiver, it does not help at all. Mine has caller ID on the handset, reception is fine, so is the lack of static, but I have to strain to hear. STAY AWAY. I WILL NOT BUY VTECH AGAIN. I paid $25 for this phone, but it isn't worth $5. When I tried to take it back, without a receipt to Target, I was told I could only swap it for the EXACT SAME PHONE. NEEDLESS TO SAY THE 2ND PHONE IS JUST AS BAD AS THE FIRST ONE. I love shopping at Target, but I am stuck with this piece of junk!"
1,ugh...,"DO NOT buy this phone... like most others here I have had nothing but trouble with the battery! After a few months, the battery on my first unit failed and wouldn't hold a charge so I got a new one... this one has the same problems! Sometimes the phone refuses to charge at all, and when it does I can talk for less than an hour before the phone beeps 'low battery' and shuts off.It was the cheapest phone at Best Buy and now I know why... you get what you pay for!"
1,Cute but Pointless,"Okay so the best thing about this phone...it was a gift. Meaning I didn't shell out any money for this piece of junk, even if it is a cheap phone. Sure it looks cute, sure it comes from a very reliable phone manufacturer BUT it has bad reception and mine stopped working 4 months after receiving it as a housewarming gift. Save your money, and your friends the hassle, and buy a nicer if more expensive basic phone!"
2,more stupid film editing,"When the songs of whales were given, there were times when music was played by musicians, and that shouldn't happen. If you are letting us hear a whale, then be silent."
4,A nice one for IMAX collection,"This is great to rent and watch and a nice one to own. If you have kids they will love it. The audio is great. Especially, the sounds whales make deep underwater."
1,DO NOT BUY THESE ARE VERY DANGEROUS,"I WILL NEVER EVER BUY THESE AGAIN, THEY DO SMELL NICE, HOWEVER ARE VERY VERY DANGEROUS. 2 HAVE BURST INTO FLAMES, SHATTERING THE GLASS JAR INTO BITS AND PIECES, THEY ALSO BURN BLACK. THEY SIMPLY ARE NOT WORTH IT. DO YOU WANT TO PUT OUT A FIRE? ORDER THEM!"
3,Thank You Maverick!,"Thank you SO much, Maverick, for releasing the Latin-sounding Robbie Rivera Club Mix of Madonna's ""Music"" on here!!! It's one of the best remixes of ""Music"". And best of all, it's the full 6:45 version and not an edit! It's a shame it wasn't included on the CD maxi-single, though; the CDM clocks in at over 73 out of 80 minutes, so there would have been room for it. Oh, well. At least it's on here."
3,Ministry's kick-off!,"This is the second album of MINISTRY, and the one they truly started being ""industrial"". It had nothing to do with their soft pop-rock bedut album (""With Sympathy""), and here Ministry got really wild, even though it was a purely electronic album.Nowadays it sounds a little out-dated, and is of real interest only to the fans of the group, or to those who would like some history lessons on how Industrial music evolved. Their next album ""The Land Of Rape And Honey"" is what really made MINISTRY the group they are now."
4,"Hamilton, Boyd and Mossman's human embryology;",A nice book featuring the detailed account from human zygote formation to the full term foetus. It also gives concise and clear to understand descriptions on the possibilities of malformations due to various conditions.
1,Shipping,"This review is not for the monitor - I'm sure it's nice. However, the ""24 shipping"" is total BS. I ordered on the 7th and PAID FOR one-day shipping. It's now the 10th and I haven't gotten the monitor. According to Amazon's website, I should expect it on the 12th. That seems to be 5-day shipping, so why did I get charged for one?"
4,Great Monitor but games beware this is not the monitor for y,Great Monitor but games beware this is not the monitor for you.HelloPicture Quality = Awesome best i have ever seen.Normal PC use ex browsing Internet = Same as above Just awesome.Movies = very well i recommend it for movies.Games = NO.. do not buy this monitor if you play 1st person games where you use mouselook alot because you will have noticable ghosting effetcs. When buying a large TFT 20 and bigger for gaming make sure it has the lowest response ms as possible and read reviews on the internet to see if the claimed response rate of the screen is Justified.Im sending this monitor back for a Viewsonic VP201b or VP201s.Hope you find this info useful.
3,"Beautiful display, speakers are a huge disappointment","This is a beautiful display, but I wanted something that has built-in speakers. My last display, a Planar flat panel, had about what you would expect from tiny built-in speakers and they served their purpose. I guess I didn't realize what I had -- because the speakers built-in to the Viewsonic display are so poor that it sounds like a $5 children's toy. HUGE disappointment, considering the size of the display and enclosure. In retrospect, I would not have purchased this display had I heard the speakers in advance."
1,How to ensure your broker profits,"Bernstein's plan to foil the purported millenium crisis certainly includes a lot of transactions. I suppose once the crisis passes, then we can all move our money back into stocks to the profit of, surprise, brokers.Just as the British government unloads literally TONS of (gold) bullion, Bernstein recommends stocking up (in the coin form). I suppose that if you compare the cost to capital of all the transactions he recommends, then the dwindling value of gold may look relatively good. Of course, Bernstein has another alternative: a precious metals MUTUAL FUND. Imagine being able to keep brokers as well as professional money managers employed through the Y2K crisis in one fell swoop.If any of Bernstein's predictions for Y2K come true, I'll come back right here and humbly point out where he was right. However, if I have electricity to start my computer, a phone line for my modem, and Amazon.com itself survives the catastrophe, how right will he have been?"
2,Not recommended,"I can't recommend this vegetable peeler because it's as dull as a stone! Don't they sharpen these things at the factory? It scrapes rather than cuts.I gave it 2 stars because the handle is comfortable and if I'm able to sharpen the blades myself, it might become a decent tool."
3,Amco Peeler,This peeler works OK but I am left handed and still find it hard to peel pototates with this peeler. I still like the older metal ones they had years ago.
2,Not sharp enough..,"I like the way it handled unlike other flimsy cheap peelers and thinking ""surgical stainless steel"" I thought this would make peeling potatoes and fruits fast and easy... so I thought. It took me quite a while to peel my first sweet potatoes because this thing is just not sharp enough. I worked with the peeler that sliced off finger tips before, but so-called ""surgical"" blades is not cutting it for me. It just takes too long with this that I rather use a knife.."
3,quilting book,Not so impressed with the book as the cover. I just can't seem to work with a quilting hoop no matter how many times I try.
2,Not that great,"I bought this album after falling in love with Deja Entendu and was sadly disappointed by this album. I know this is their debut album and shouldn't have expected the quality of their sophomore album, but I did."
5,Your Favorite Album,"Your Favorite Weapon is amazing. It has been a long time since an album like this has shown its face. The lyrics are heartfelt and creative (i.e. Soco Amaretto Lime, No Seatbelt Song, Mix Tape, Seventy Times Seven). The music and lyrics are unique and stay with you...only thing better is the performence."
3,What's the big deal?,"I got the CD due to all the hype, and needless to say I'm disappointed. The songs tend to blend together with the same mediocre pop punk riffage and somewhat annoying singer. Brand New has nothing brand new to offer in their sound. It's the same boring old pop punk album you've heard a million times. Sure, there's a few good tracks on here, but this is definitely not a CD I will be listening to very much. If you want some more original pop punk I would suggest Yellowcard, Thrice, Finch, RX Bandits, AFI, or even some Green Day or Bad Religion."
5,Tell All the English Boys You Meet....,"I heard about Brand New when I heard Jude Law and a Semester abroad, purchased this cd...and fell completly in love with them. They have a great hardcore punk sound, much like the juliana theory, dead poetic, taking back sunday, and other bands. Their sound varies from song to song making the album energetic and appealing to listen to time after time. I recently saw them in concert last month and not only do they record wonderfull music, they put on an AMAZING show, make sure you tell all your friends, Ive already gotten all of mine hooked!"
2,Typical,"I used to be a big fan of Brand New's second album, DEJA ENTENDU, so I bought this one. I was unimpressed. This is a very typical pop-punk emo angst CD. A few of the tracks are all right (""The Shower Scene,"" for example), but there is nothing very impressive here.If you're a fan of DEJA ENTENDU, don't bother. If you're a fan of SUM 41 or GOOD CHARLOTTE, go for it."
5,Brand New....Amazing,"My god...Why haven't you bought this cd yet? it's almost sickening how good it is. The lyrics-amazing, dark, poetic, reflective, intelligent, brings you into the moment. The music-awesome, rock n rollin, brilliant. The vocals-Seering, depressing, delighting, harmonizing, awesome bittersweet melodies. I saw brand new live with thrice/recover last month, they are so great i can't describe, the cd is also just as good, one of the few pop punk bands that also has really really good deep moving lyrics. It's just a great cd to have, and to hold...and to love....yeah haha, its really great, if you like punk, rock, soft rock, emo, or pop punk you will LOVE this awesome album."
5,Addicting,I just happened to stumble on to Brand New when one of there videos was on tv. The video was for Jude Law and a Semester Abroad which is one of my favorites on Your Favorite Weapon. This cd is addicting. Every song is great and has a good catchy beat. Brand New does an awsome job of mixing up the slower songs with their faster songs so you get a break from the more up beat songs.This cd is well done and worth buying exspecially if your looking for a good solid band with a bright future.
3,Good for a pop-punk album,"Ok, this was a good pop-punk album, much better than most of the pop-punk stuff out there, but the new album ""Deja Entendu"" is 100 times better than this album. Theyre completely different styles, but Deja Entendu has better music and lyrics and its so emotional. I recommend that one instead of this one. But if you like pop-punk, this is a good album to get."
5,SAWEEEET! Awesome CD - Transnasty,This CD is so amazing.Your favourite weapon i belive is my second favourite CD of all time behind TAYF by Taking Back Sunday.This CD is pure genius.Pick It Up!
3,Not Even Close,"I bought this CD after hearing a lot of hype about how they were ""Just as good as Taking Back Sunday,"" but kids, they're not even close. Aside from the music, this album is mixed very very poorly compared to TBS. If I had heard this record first, I might've enjoyed it more than I do now. There are a few stand-out tracks like Jude Law and Mix Tape but a lot of the album just drags and lacks originality or something with a meaning or point to say... If you really liked this CD- go check out Taking Back Sunday."
3,Okay...,"Ah poppy punk. Where would the world be without you? Does Brandnew bring anything (brand) new to the table (ha ha)? Not really. Their lyrics are somewhat dark humor, but that seems to be the trend these days. As for the music, sub-par. It's not something I haven't heard in bands like Rufio or Taking Back Sunday (who are touring with Brandnew). This rating is more of a 3.5 stars. It's okay, but just not my bag. And I usually like anything."
2,This book is just not accurate,"I have to agree with Stephen Haines. This guy drags in everything but the kitchen sink. He makes Boehme a Gnostic, the troubadors, the Knights Templar, William Blake, the Masons, Jung, and finally, any physicist worth his salt.I mean, some of these folks might not have been orthodox in their Christian practice, but being heterodox does not make one a Gnostic.How did he forget Meister Eckhart, and Sabbatai Tzvi? If he has Boehme as a Gnostic, then these also are Gnostic.He never distinguishes between Gnosticism as a group of sects, and gnostic practice, which pervades Kabbalah, Sufism,etc.This is just not a good book."
1,Worst Purchase Ever !,one of the worst purchases I've ever made. Bought 2 and neither one works at all ! Blows warm air for about 1 minute then blows cold air.
1,very dissappointed,"Looks like a toy... and provides an airflow less than a toy. I was completely dissappointed with this product. Instant heat my behind. You plug it in, and there is an airflow,but the thing never really heats up. Don't waste your money like I did... Hopefully there is a return policy, but I doubt it. I wish I could have rated lower than 1 star. Garbage!!"
1,ThermTec Road Worthy Auto Heat 12V Portable Car Heater,The unit did not get past lukewarm and the fan was not strong enough to push the air to the windshield.
3,Not the Redmond Hamper from 40 years ago!,"I purchased the Redmond Hamper because I have one that is 40 years old that I still use! The hamper is also made in the U.S., which is hard to find!It is a nice looking hamper, but I purchased the one without the interior bag. The inside lining of the hamper feels almost like paper. My old one has a nicer finish inside. It would have been nice if it was finished with some sort of paint or smooth surface.I like the small size of the hamper. My kids use it for their ""whites"" so I don't have to spend so much time separating clothes when I do laundry."
3,Pretty Good,"Basically, this is a good item. It is great that the liner comes out and you can carry it to the washer that way. The only problem I have had with it is that the liner has been slowing ripping at the seam. It may be because, at times, we have had a lot in there, but I think it is from taking the liner in and out while doing the laundry (it kind of rubs up against the side). Now I just take the whole hamper with me to do the laundry (that's one good think about it being small). On the whole, I would still recommend this item. I wish they had replacement liners, though."
4,Great hamper..inside bag didn't last,"I got this hamper at my baby shower. Now my son is 3 and we are still using it. The bag inside ripped, but it lasted a year (maybe a little less). But we still use the hamper without the bag. It holds all his clothes, even more without the bag inside and it's lite enough to take to the laundry room. We are going to get another one for our baby due 12/04."
4,"Like the hamper, ripped liner","I have two of these, and I like the style and size. I noted on many reviews that the liner ripped. Mine did, too, and I don't even remove it very often. I'm trying to track down the company to get a new one (and to get more of the sticks--my kids keep playing with them and losing them)."
3,Good buy!,This hamper is perfect. Just throw the dirty clothes in and dump them into your washer. Ya never touch the clothes again until there clean with the removable liner. It looks good too :o)One down fall the liner rips after several usages. Mine is falling apart. it started tearing after I had it 6 months.
4,"""The Voice""","I was torn between getting ""Street Talk"" on c.d. or buying this c.d. with a lot of music I was not familiar with. Ended up buying, and loving, this album. Perry is simply a superb vocalist in the same vein as Barbra Streisand. He could sing the phone book and I'd listen.That being said, I do think lyrically some of his songs could have been improved upon. ""What Was,"" for instance, is a great concept and Perry sings it beautifully, but the lyrics are weak. What a bummer because had he collaborated with a great lyricist, I think it could have easily been released as a single.It's too bad Perry retired so early because I think he could have gone on to enjoy a great solo career had this been his ambition."
4,Showcasing the voice...,"A very interesting collection of tunes from Perry's two solo albums and a tentative album-'Against the Wall'-supposed to have been released in 1988,define AOR in terms of musicianship,taste,and incredible vocal performance.Since Perry is such a great songwriter,remains to be seen whether the new Journey incarnation will ever come close to the the aural quality of some of this material."
5,steve perry at his best!!!!!!,"For those of you who have only listened to Steve Perry in conjunction with Journey, then, you're missing an entierly different side of him as an artist. This cd offers some early work with one of his first bands, along with solo projects from the Journey days, and projects that have been done since his departure from Journey. His talent can be seen in all the tracks on this cd, if you're a true Steve Perry fan, you won't want to miss this one. From ""Oh, Sherrie"" to ""I Stand Alone"", to some demo tapes and my ALL time favorite, my personal signature song, ""Foolish Heart"",this is the one for TRUE Steve Perry fans. You gotta get this one! Sure hope to hear more from Steve in the near future!"
4,Solo Shame,"One has to wonder why a man with immense writing and singing capabilities such as Mr.Perry hasnt been more successful?, Having listened to this album, Steve is better without Journey frankly ""trial by Fire"" was in injustice to Steve really.If any recording executives are reading this, do youself a favour and release track 16 ""It wont be you"" as a single in Europe, it is a classic and has number 1 written all over it, Steve, shouldnt pass up his chance to establish himself as a great solo artist"
4,Does not include For the Love of Strange Medicine,"This is a great cd, i own it but there is another greatest hits wich includes a truly great song by Steve, For the Love of Strange Medicine, get that one instead of this, you won't regret it. An excellent song, music, voice and lyrics, it became the title of his album and it touches a big social problem of todays society.Far inside the dark roomBehind all the wallsUnderneath the concreteHeaven starts to fallWalkin' on the sidewalksRed lights turn to blueSomewhere in the darknessStanding there is youSome are believersSome don't know(some are lost)They're lost and aloneSome are deceiversTheir souls been sold(for the love)All for the loveAll for the love of strange medicine"
2,One voice,"Steve Perry is one of the best rock-voices ever. With or without Journey makes no difference,because in both cases it's still his voice that makes the difference!!"
2,Who's crying now ???,"I am for wasting my money on this cd. The only good stuff on this cd is from his excellent album Street Talk. The rest of the stuff isn't even fit to sing in the shower, which is the only place Steve Perry should have sung these songs. Steve Perry has one of the best recorded voices ever but most of these songs were just painful to listen to, a total disappointment. He really shines on his Street Talk CD, get that one instead!"
2,Great voice! Not so great album...,"Yep, Steve Perry has one of the great voices of rock - no doubt about it, but I wish he had better post-Journey material to sing than this stuff.'Oh Sherrie' is a great song, as is 'You Better Wait', where he gets a great vocal workout. I can take or leave the rest of the songs though; they are pretty much just generic hard rock.'What Was' made me wonder what-could-have-been. There's a great song in there struggling to get out, but didn't quite make it.The rest is filler. Would someone PLEASE give write this man some great songs to sing! That voice is going to waste!At least let him release an album of covers."
2,Unreleased Should Have Stayed That Way,Only the songs from Street Talk are worth hearing and the unreleased stuff is unlistenable.
2,Greatest Hits????,"The number of glowing reviews for this CD is astounding to me. In a nostalgic mood, I started listening to the Journey box set, ""Time3"", then moved into Steve Perry first solo venture, ""Street Talk"". That should be the only Greatest Hits package available. This is pretty lousy. The tracks from the 1988 unreleased solo CD ""Against the Wall"" are pretty awful. There is a reason the record company did not release the CD, if they thought it was good and would sell, they would have released it. Where are the hooks??? Nothing memorable, lyrics of syrup and unimaginative music or arrangements. Only a couple of songs from ""Strange Medicine"" and that is a good thing. I am a Steve Perry fan, have all his stuff, including the CD singles that have some of the unreleased tracks on them, but, to be honest, the hooks haven't been there for awhile (including the reunion Journey CD) and the voice is thinning. There just isn't that much good here."
3,Not what I expected,"I was looking for a supplemental curriculum book for the classroom. Most of the crafts in this book are standard paper plate puppets, and toilet paper noisemakers. I do enjoy the recipes for the clay section though. This book is more for a craft book for children and not an educator."
4,Good handbook for beginners,"This concise little handbook (120 pages) has chapters on buying orchids, growing requirements, potting, growing under lights, diseases and pests, propagation, hybridizing, collecting and showing orchids. The info is good and easy to understand for beginning enthusiasts. The book does not spent much time on the different types of orchids and their specific requirements so this should by no means be considered a comprehensive guide."
5,The easiest way to learn how to start your own business!,"As the CEO and co-founder of Net-Avenue, learning about business and how they operate was a key. Working with Danielle Vallee has been a great experience! Net-Avenue, featured in Danielle's new book, is just an example of what her book can help you achieve. Whiz Teens in Business helps teenagers understand the business lingo of today, and use it for tomorrow! I highly recommend you check out this book."
5,GREAT BOOK FOR ANYONE THINKING ABOUT STARTING A BUSINESS!,"This is a wonderful book that really has a comprehensive and step-by-step process to successfully starting your own business. It is really easy to understand, and it's interesting too! I would recommend this book to any teenager that ever even thought of starting a business. ""Whiz Teens in Business"" makes you realize even you can do it, and gives you the confidence and tools to start it. Check out their website"
5,great reference book,"This is a really good book to use whenever you need to know something about starting a business. For me, it wasn't something that I would want to read cover-to-cover. As a 14-year-old, there was one thing I could really do without: the sketchy pictures of wizards and dragons. They're just plain corny, and something that I don't want to look at when I'm thinking about starting a business. But don't worry, it's not that bad, you just have to be able to ignore things very well. Don't let it stop you from buying the book, cause other than that, it's pretty good. I am glad that I have it, and I would reccomend it to the ambitious teenager."
2,Weepy,I watched this video & found myself feeling depressed. Unusual for a Gaither video. Most of them are very uplifting and inspiring. I would not say this was one of the best. Only interesting moment was celebrating Billl's 60th birthday.
2,Seems to be somewhat buggy...,"For some reason the phone will not capture long distance CID information where all my other phones will; calls from within the programmed ""Local Area Codes"" all capture fine. Ergonomics are OK, but you will need to keep an external CID box inline with the phone to make sure you're not losing call information - kind of defeating the point of a phone having built-in CID. A Panasonic speakerphone and external CID box may be a better, though pricier choice."
2,white noise in the background,"I had to return this phone because of the level of the background noise, which I found unacceptable. The sound quality was not very good on mine. When you turn up the volume to hear the other person better, of course the noise gets amplified as well. The other problem I noticed with it was that I could hear my own voice stronger than what I am used to. This can be problematic when both parties happen to speak at the same time. You can miss some of the other person's words because of the echo of your own voice."
4,perfect for its worth,"This phone is absolutely perfect for a phone in this price range. Ive had the phone for about a week now with only one issue. The time/date stamp on the phone is set through the caller ID system. The time and date are set via your phone company rather than you (i.e. if they have the wrong time or date, you are out of luck). The way to set the time...wait for the first call. This in itself is not a big deal, however nowhere in the manual or on their website does this get relayed to the consumer. Otherwise 5 stars."
4,Great phone for the price,"I've been looking for a phone to replace my old AT&T with a dead display. This one has most of the same features, but is missing separate speed dial buttons (which I can live without). The only other thing it is really missing is a backlight on the display. Unfortunately, mine is not in a very well lit area. Five stars if it had a backlighted display!"
3,"Phone worked, display didnt",Phone worked well. Display failed after a short time which was inconvenient as this was one of the reasons for buying the phone !
3,OK for a cheap phone,"This phone has met all my expectations for a cheap phone with caller ID for my home office. My only complaint is that the shape of the receiver makes it hard to hold between my should and ear (when I want ""no hands"" operation and not use the speaker phone)."
1,Very annoying!,"It makes very annoying and loud beeping sounds every time you touch it and has no volume control to lower the beeping sound or turn it off. Another very annoying thing about this phone is that there is no manual option to set/change time and date. Although the manual states that the time and date will be corrected with each incoming call, it has not changed once yet (So, unless you plan to turn the phone on exactly at the beginnig of the year, you can't change the stupid time and date)! As mentioned in the earlier reviews by others, the display is really hard to see when it is placed flat on the desk."
1,Desk phone - I think not,"Big time design flaw on this. I just returned the phone because when it is sitting on a desk, you can't possibly see the caller id readout. It is tilted towards the back of the phone so you have to stand up everytime you get a call. Might be okay as a wall phone."
1,Putting it in the basement,This phone is terrible for decent use. The caller-id is impossible to see and the speaker phone is low quality. It's definitely a low quality product.
2,Have to stand up to see caller id.,"I'm amazed at this design flaw. I don't have space to wall mount this phone, so It must sit on my desk. However, when it sits on the desk, the display is tilted backwards (away from the person sitting at the desk), so I must stand up to read caller id display (to decide if I want to answer the phone). How annoying. The whole reason I got a speakerphone was so that I could work uninterrupted at my desk if I wanted to answer calls. Now I have to stop my work and stand up to decide. If you can wall mount this phone, the display would be easily visible, and the phone might otherwise work great. I never got as far as to try it."
4,Good quality - perfect features!,"I bought this phone for my home office and have found it to be great. As always, AT&T is good for quality, but this phone also has all my necessary features. The screen displays the time & date as well as the caller id/call waiting telephone number and name. You can also use the ""display dial"" to redial a number appearing on caller id and even has a hold button along with speakerphone. Basically, you get lots of features for a good price!"
1,Weak Feature Set,"My office installed these phones.Here are the cons:First, loud beep cannot be switched off.Second, no speed dial.Third, when on a call you can't access another number eg if you dial your cell phone voicemail with one number and when it picks up you want to input the access code and the password - you can't do that with this phone.Fourth, no speed dial.Fifth, accessing the directory when you hit the button, it seems to put you into edit mode instantly. Trying to access some numbers I managed to have accidentally entered a whole bunch of caller id's.Sixth, display is hard to see, but if you turn contrast down to minimum (1) then it is OK, but still at an awkward slant.Pros:One Its cheapTwo Its OK to look at, nice and white.Summary. I hate it. I'm thinking of buying my own phone for work."
5,Best Thai cookbook ever!,"I grew up in Thailand and for years, I've been looking for a Thai cookbook that would help me recreate some of my favorite dishes from my childhood. My search ends here. This book is the best I have ever seen. The list of condiments and of ustensils is clear and precise, the recipes are well explained, and the photographs are beautiful. This is the real thing! (The next best book I have found is called ""Thai Cooking Made Easy"", in a small format)."
1,Disappointing,"Maybe it's just me, but I found the recipes too salty. It doesn't taste like the thai food I've had in restaurants. I want to say the taste is more like PF Changs just because it was salty. I've only tried two recipes. One with fried fish and the other ground beef. It's too bad I can't return this book. It's very pretty with pictures, but the taste was off for me."
5,How to rebuild poor soil,"This book is written from the point of view of the farm wife who is telling how she and Alfred were able to take a worn out farm and turn it into a very productive farm by grass land farming. The farm under consideration was 100 acres. The lessons in the book could be applied to a backyard garden just as easily. A lot of the book is biographical in nature, but there are a few nuggets of information sprinkled throughout. The last chapter is by far the best as it summarizes the yearly planting and harvesting practices that Alfred and Margaret developed. The fourth chapter also has a description of what worn out land looks like and the weeds that take it over, and a little understanding of why. Well worth reading if you are dreaming of escaping the city for land in the country.All-in-all, a very heart warming story and and timeless information."
5,Great book for fly fishermen,"Bought the book for son who is into fly fishing and tying. He really liked it. Now husband wants one, too"
3,Nice pictures.,"Nice pictures and material lists, but for a novice like me it would have been helpful to me to have had included a hook number or at a least hook type."
5,"A very practical book, Easy to follow.","It's easy to follow, and has great patterns. I'm a newbie to fly tying and picked up a small assortment of recommended books. This one is the one I prefer to use most often. The others are ok. This one is just a cut above due to the fact it's easy to use, to tie dynamite flies."
5,The Fly-Tying Bible: 100 Deadly Trout and Salmon Flies in Step by Step Photographs,My husband has been tying flyies for over 30 years - I got this for his birthday and he loved it and uses it frequently.
5,Good!,This is a great mag to buy but the screws are not the most durable metal and will easily strip
5,Fits The G36 M85P,"These are for your standard G36's. They work great, hold around 40 pellets, and are just like the one that came with my gun."
4,pretty good mag BUT NOT FOR THE JG Version,"this seems like a really good mag, and it holds around 50 bbs, so if you have a speed reloader, it works great with this product, has a good build and it seems to be made of pretty solid materials, only problem is that if you have a JG version of the g36, it doesnt fit, the mags a different."
4,All as advertised,Bot as a spare. Works well. Fast delivery.Wish these mags had greater capacity....really requires multiple mags when using automatic selector
4,Just like the original one,"This came in good time, good shape and quality. Just like the original one that came with the gun. Would buy again"
3,m85 AEG Magazine/clip,"well I am a beginner in airsoft, and by beginner I mean I have only been playing for 6 months.the m85 is a good gun only if you treat it right the gun its self is decent the extras that come with it are junk except the tactical handle and the laser. the mag is good but when putting it in an airsoft vest its can be a little tricky in a pinch."
3,Weird feeding problem ?,"The last bb always fails to feed from the Other than that its all plastic,used with a double eagle m85."
3,Ormingat,"genre: Science FictionSetting: Great Britain/present dayBritish author Waugh craftily writes of the bond of love between father and son. The narrative has a fine weave but I personally found it too long.I rarely read science fiction. The title doesn't fit--the ""race"" is to make a deadline. I was engrossed by the idea of an extraterrestrial father and son posing as humans coming to the end of their ""mission"" and facing ambiguity to return home.Details of extraterrestrial life struck me as scant. There is little imagination employed outside of humankind and little action. This and the British setting may make American children put it down after a few chapters."
3,Hauntingly beautiful music,"I heard a portion of this album at a ballet last year and I have been searching for the album ever since. It is primal music, hauntingly beautiful!"
4,Spiritual Barometer,"If you are a 'born again' Christian and want to know how you are doing spiritually, read this book. But I caution you to check your pride at the door. It will challenge you to take a sober assessment of your true spiritual condition. Just as we don't see our hair and nails grow, we can lose sight of our growing pride, self-reliance, and distance from God. This will jolt us back to the reality that we are in constant need of God's grace, mercy, and power. If your spitiual 'walk' has grown boring and routine; if your life isn't filled with joy and producing the fruits of the Spirit, then you NEED this book now!"
5,Twangy/chunky,"Ahhhhhh K. I'm on this Amazon mission of tasty snacks from a regular curious guy. This Pickle/relish is awesome. If you have the craving to taste chunky stuff in brown sauce. It looks like raw veggies in brown gravy, but, has the smell of vinegar. It's odd for the newcomer (I think this topping is British). I have put a tablespoon or less along side of many suppers with a slight dab on my fork. Creates a A-1 sauce second taste love. Try it. At first different; later you ran out ..need more."
5,when used correctly...,"I found Branston pickle unappealing on it's own. Bit too tangy for my pallet, but I read it was great on Beef and cheddar cheese sandwiches and it is!I personally think it reminds me of A1 steaksauce with a chunky kick.I look forward to finding more obscure uses for this British delight in my american home."
1,Relish... Kinda..,I love relish. I do not love Branston pickles. Maybe because I didn't grow up on it but I cannot say I am a fan of this relish.
5,Glad I found it on Amazon!,"I learned to love Branston Pickle when I was working for Laker Skytrain in England many years ago. I am American but have become very fond of English food and traditions. Now I have my source for the future, thank you."
5,Koolatron Krusader Cooler,"I did a lot of research and found out that all of these types of coolers cool depending upon the ambient air temperature. Most of the models stated they cooled 20 degrees below the ambient temperature, I found this unsatisfactory. Koolatron states this model will cool 40 degrees below the ambient air temperature. I purchased the Koolatron Krusader Cooler and used it on a weekend camping trip with some friends. This thing worked fantastic! Our food stayed cool all weekend with temperatures hovering around 80 -85. In fact I set the eggs too close to the area where the cooling unit is and it actually froze one of the eggs. I would purchase another one when time comes to replace this one which I believe will last for a long time."
1,To Hot to Touch,The P 85 plug get too hot to touch when plugged into the outlet in my van after about 30 minutes. I am returning the unit.
3,Needs a little help,"We bought the cooler to keep cold or frozen food cold when we were either shopping or driving around. It had a hard time staying cold in the warm weather if the cooler had to sit in the car. When we added a couple of frozen freezettes then the cooler stayed cold, below 40 degrees."
3,A Fridge with No Thermostat?,"Who ever heard of a refrigerator with no on/off switch and no thermostat?This is especially important when it's running on the same battery that will be used to start the car. Why run the battery down when it's ""cool enough"" inside?Koolatron does offer models with thermostats but they were not displayed when I was searching for this and bought it. When I contacted them about the parts their answer was, ""Unfortunately, the thermister wires have to be installed at the time the cooling unit is put into place. Otherwise, it will not be properly done. We do not make those parts available to customers for that reason."" Who knows, maybe I would have gotten it right? Certainly would have been better that the amateur thermostat I installed.The good news is that the product works and does what I want. Shame on Koolatron for lousy marketing and service. tsk, tsk..."
1,I am an OTR Driver and need a good/cold cooler without the prob. with ice,"This is the one in most truck stops, and therefore thought it was the one to buy...but now that I've bought a 2ND one that has lasted 3-5 months then starts cooling less and then just creates hot air inside and out, I'll never buy another Coleman thermoelectric. The motor starts making noise interrupting sleep and peace of mind, etc.After talking to many seasoned drivers they say they've gone Thur the same thing and have educated themselves and found that the definitive cooler of this type is the ""Koolatron"" brand. They are sold here. Ck'em out. I'm going for the P-95 a 45Qt. I know of one driver who has had his for 2yrs. and still working fine. That's good enough for me to win me over.Also, I am seeing them in Pilot trk. stops.Coleman, says you have to cut the cord remove the lid and motor and mail them back to Colemand for the warrantybe valid. Then, after 6 weeks you'll get a refund."
3,"Cute play mat, but too small.","This play mat does a good job of entertaining. The flying birdie mobile above is a nice touch. However, once your infant starts rolling, this mat is too small and very confining."
4,A very good introductory book in digital circuits analysis,"This book will serve as a good start for readers interested in the area of digital circuits. It's so easy to read and understand it becomes sometimes kinda boring. Everything you need is there, even some mathematical equalities. You are not going to consult other books in the area if you are a beginner as this seems to be the most down-to-earth one. If you're a little bit expert in the subject you might want to consult more advanced alternatives."
5,Five Guys Walk into a Bar,"This collection is excellent for those who wish to hear what is considered the true, basic Rod Stewart and the Faces. Before the all the stardom and sometimes thought of over production seem to controlthe music. Great basic raw cratfmenship shines in this product."
1,This is not the Faces I know and love!!,"When I saw that the Faces were gonna release a box set, I was overjoyed--until I read the box contents....GrrrrrrHow could anyone call this a Faces box set with GLAREING omissions such as Ogdens Nut Gone Flake or even Itchycoo Park??? Yeah yeah yeah...I know...these are the Rod Stewart Faces....well phooey on that.The Faces were a much better band without the egotistical Roddie stealing the limelight. I for one shall forego the pleasure(?) of this box set and listen to my old, scratchy Ogdens Nut Gone Flake and remeber what a powerhouse band this was before the arrival of Rod the Mod."
4,Very good,"If you buy this box set, you will not have everything the Faces recorded, except for:- FIRST STEP: Wicked Messenger, Pineapple and the Monkey, and Stone- LONG PLAYER: Tell Everyone, Jerusalem- A NOD IS AS GOOD AS A WINK: Memphis, TN- OH LA LA: My Fault, Fly in the OintmentI would spend the 99-cents per song ($5) and get Tell Everyone, My Fault, Memphis, Wicked Messinger, and Pinneapple. Fly in the Ointment and Jerusalem are non-essential instrumental throw-aways."
5,Absolutely fantastic box set.,"Nothing from this year even comes close.All the songs, even the raw live stuff sound AWESOME.What an amazing group of musicians.5 stars plus. Go out and get this."
4,Very good - could have been great,Although this is wonderful it is difficult to listen to raw rehearsals next to album cuts next to live songs. It could have been much better and the best anthology/box set ever if they had included their 4 albums in chronological order on the first 2 discs (they are short enough to get 2 on each disc); then a disc of live material and a disc of rarities/rehearsals. Oh well guess I'll just enjoy what is here.
5,"don't think, just buy","box sets are a like insurance policies these days, a dime a dozen. it really is hard to tell the difference between them all, or just what it really is that you are getting. well, let's just say that you are getting the faces, glorious warts and all. quite possibly the greatest rocknroll band of all time, even better than the ""world's greatest"" band? the greatness of the faces lies in the consistent brilliance of their sound. there really isn't too much experimentation which is really a good thing. doomed to becoming overshadowed by singular, solo post-faces acts, the faces have been relegated to relative obscurity in the rocknroll pantheon. but to die hards, the legacy will live forever on. god bless ronnie lane."
4,It's worth it,"I'm a big fan of Rod Stewart's early solo 70s albums. I only have one of the faces albums, a wink is as good etc....I wasn't sure if it was worth putting together a box set of faces material, but I heard this playing in a record store and didn't know what it was. When I found out it was the faces box set, I thought damn I have to get this. It's worth it. There are a few live tracks and outtakes that have low production quality, but overall the box set is worth it if you're a fan of early rod and/or faces."
2,"If you loved the book, you'll hate this movie!","This movie is so far removed from the book, It is hard to believe that the screenwriters even read the original books.I don't see why they even bothered to call it ""Anne of Green Gables"", since they chose to create an entirely different story than the original. Please watch the Canadian Movies starring Megan Follows, Colleen Dewhurst and Richard Farnsworth."
5,Never in a million years!,"It is a rare event when a movie stricks my interest so much that I can sit in front of the television playing it over and over again. But the Anne of Green Gables trilogy does just that. My heart swells with the romances of Anne, and one can't help but laugh at the antics Anne gets herself, and her friends, in. These films are wonderful for little kids, and absolutely brilliant for those of us wanting to remain young at heart. I would definitely guarantee that you will like the movies!"
4,LM Montgomery's opinion,"I didn't rate this movie because I haven't seen it, though I am purchasing it anyway. I am a huge fan and even have the complete published set of L. M. Montgomery's journals. This movie was made in her lifetime and she met the actress who played Anne as well as attended the preview and she wrote extensively about the movie in her journal.She HATED the movie. She said that though the actress was nice, her characterization of Anne was all wrong and Matthew was not at all what she imagined when she wrote him.I wonder how she would feel about th 1980's Anne movies?"
1,"Sorry, I thought this was the Megan Follows version...",i've made a mistake. I gave this video 5 stars when really I haven't seen it. Please see:This Movie Deserves More Than Five Starsthat is refering to the Megan Follows version.sorry.thankyou
1,Horrible Transfer to DVD,"This transfer to DVD is terrible. There are horizontal grey-scale bands moving up the screen the entire movie, as though they had ""filmed"" this straight off a video monitor and not from a 35mm print. A wonderful movie spoiled by this annoyance."
3,Disappointing,"This movie was cute but didn't follow the book very much. I would have liked to have seen the scene where Anne has her teacher over and finds a mouse in the jam. The biggest problem I had with the movie was that they combined Diana Barry's mom with Rachel Lynde to form RACHEL BARRY. Could they not afford two actreses? Rachel Lynde is essential to the story and all her children were grown and she was at least in her fifties in the book. Plus, they made Marilla much too harsh. And then there was a scene where Anne and Marilla kissed and it was sure a long kiss. Strange!However, the acting was above par. I loved Anne Shirley and the guy who played Gil was charming.If you really want to see ANNE at its best, I suggest that you buy the version with the supremely talented Megan Follows."
3,That's Anne With An 'E'...,"This is a very enjoyable adaptation of the classic story, and Anne Shirley is absolutely wonderful as the title character. However, I think the film probably would have been a little stronger had it been made four or five years later when Hollywood filmmakers had really mastered their craft. This version still shows the theatrical influence left over from the silent era (note the focus on facial expressions and the heavy eye makeup on Marilla). Nonetheless, it's still a fine little movie for kids of all ages.As for this DVD edition, the film appears to be taken from an old television print rather than the original negative. The picture quality is acceptable, but there is no evidence of any restoration work and there are gray bands that scroll down the screen throughout the movie. In other words, don't expect the crisp image quality you'd expect from a DVD released by one of the major studios."
5,Good for Headers,"After swapping to a set of headers on a 305 I tried bending the original dipstick, but it just wouldn't work right. Ordered this and after an easy install was all set. Makes for a nice engine dress-up item as well. Well-made, good quality item. A little on the pricey side but you get what you pay for."
4,Awesome Product,"I would have to say I love this shampoo with all my heart. : )Smells awesome, and leaves my head and my dreads feeling sqeaky clean. The only reason why I gave it a 4 is because its pretty much 8 times as expensive as the old shampoo I used to use, but its worth it if you can pay for it, and the shipping."
4,Great!,"My husband has dreads and we're always on the lookout for good dread products. This product works wells, smells great and comes in the cutest packaging(love the little knotty boy on the bottle)! Plus it's biodegradable & mountain stream friendly. AND, as it can be used for locked and non-locked hair I have definitely been wanting to try it myself. HOWEVER, the price is definitely up there and don't want to take any away from my husbands needs just because I LOVE the smell. Thumbs up here!"
2,Lightweight but weak.,"This vacuum is very lightweight and looks nice, but it is very weak. I got this to replace my dirt devil hand vac and it seems my hand vac was about 5 times stronger. Where I would only have had to make one stroke with the hand vac to pick something up, I have to run this thing over it 5 times. It won't pick up anything minutely stuck to the carpet (a string). It picks up makes clumps of hair, but doesn't suck them in, so it gathers on the rim and I have to pull it out. There is no bag so when you open up the lid it's very messy and dust goes everywhere. This vacuum would probably work best to pick up little crumbs, but if you plan on using it for anything else, get something else! I recommend a hand vac."
3,Cute but flimsy,"Nice looking product, worked OK for awhile. Rather quickly started falling apart. Burned through many belts, seems to clog really quickly (and is a pain to take apart to unclog). Probably fine for very light work."
2,Do not buy this model!,"I am a student living in a small apartment, and I bought this vacuum cleaner hoping it would do a good job cleaning my new carpet. Having used this unit several times, I realized that the name ""Devil"" only refers to its noise-producing capacity and not to its suction power. It did a lousy job cleaning my carpet and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. My grandmother, who lives nearby, once borrowed the cleaner, only to return it back the next day saying she'd rather use a wet rug than this vacuum cleaner. So save your money and buy a better (even if heavier) vacuum cleaner!"
4,great buy,the book arrived in great condition for the price that i paid. very illustrative. gives examples of many different types of runic alphabets. i would definitely recommend this book for people just starting out in rune history and lore.
1,Late for Christmas!!!!!!!,"We have NOT received this product, but you want a comment on it's greatness?? It is now three days after Christmas and my grandson is without. Still waiting..... I rated it because you forced me to :(("
4,Good tactics practice,"This is the first chess puzzle book I've tried to work my way through, so I don't know how to compare it to others. but I have found it useful so far. It is essentially 100% positions and solutions, with very little explanatory text, but the puzzles themselves seem appropriately graded, and I've only found one error in the solutions (a pretty good error rate from what I've heard about puzzle books). I'm not a very advanced player, so I find myself wishing for a bit more explanation in the solutions sometimes, but generally I can understand them. The book is divided into three sections based on difficulty, and for me, some of the puzzles in the first section were easy, some hard, but all more or less at my level. The other two sections, from the few puzzles I attempted in each, seem much more challenging."
5,great christmas CD,"Great cd 2 listen 2. Love it. They need 2 make more christmas cd's like this 1. What are people waiting 4. U missing a great christmas cd. 1 more thing ""happy listening""!"
5,Great buy!,"We bought it with the soccer player groom together. It looks gorgeous!!! It is taller the the soccer groom, but hopefully the guest wont point it out on the wedding."
4,So cute!,I purchased this bride with the golfing groom. They are both adorable. The quality seems to be pretty good for the price. I plan on putting them on our golf themed grooms cake at our wedding.
4,Different cake topper,The bride topper with the male will be something different for the wedding cake. The items came quickly and were in good shape. I would order from them again
3,Halway Pleased,"I am a huge Curt Smith fan and had heard a few songs from this album a few years ago .I bought the album recently and it is a good album but not as good as the Mayfield album or Curt's 1st solo album were better.his voice is still very strong if you have seen live footage of TFF reunion shows you know his voice is still great.the best songs are Seven Of Sundays there is the orginal and a french duet version. I like the french version with singer So better since she brings something to the song that the orginal does not have.Greatest Divide is my favorite song a very relaxing tume,also Where Do We Go And Aeroplane are very nice but they were better in the rock versions that were released on the Aeroplane ep in 2000.the other standout is the live version of Snow Hill that was performed during the TFF reunion tour a few years ago.the other songs are okay but not Curt's best work.I would start with Mayfield and Soul On Board first.this album is a 3!"
3,Five Stars for what,For the wait!!!I was a huge TFF fan but sorry this doesn't cut it!!!!!!!There is just too much better music out there!
5,More then Halfway Pleased,"Halfway Pleased is very personal and beautiful Album. This is a very quiet, and tranquil album from Curt Smith. I love the melody, tenderness of songs, and deeply personal lyrics. This is a must have!. Great job Curt."
5,ALL THE WAY PLEASED!!,"This is not TFF, but it is a great CD. I have been a TFF fan since The Hurting. I have recently come to really appreciate Curt Smith. He has matured as an artist, and this CD reveals a side of him that I had not known. I hope he continues his work. I agree with other reviewers. Roland added an edge and lyrical irony that is missing from Curt Smith's work. Together they were a great combination. However, I love the tender songs, and deeply personal lyrics in this work. I recommend that you listen to it with headphones. It is really well produced and wonderful. Way to go Curt!"
5,All you do is poop pooop poop poop,The best thing since sliced breadcan't taste it in anything you mix it withRegular BM's twice a day
3,Expensive but good,This product was reevied ahead of the expected date and was just as advertised. I have used the product for several years now and it does just was is advertised - disolves well in cold or hot drinks. The cost has become excessive so I have split my use with a different product.
1,Complete Junk,"Please, I'm begging you, go buy the casio fx-115ms instead.Don't say I never gave you anything"
1,good seller...bad item,"The pan arrived well within the promised time...extremely well packaged but, and it is a big but...the pan itself was very badly made. The base, which should have been flat, was so bowed that it rocked gently on the tiny spot in the centre that actually touched the surface. The best one could hope for would be 1 burnt cooked pancake surrounded by 6 raw ones! Very disappointed in the product."
1,Not much here,"This is really just a collection of pictures, less than 50 of them, and it sells for nearly $20. It's a creative idea that doesn't go anywhere. You could download 50 discussion pieces off the internet for free. I didn't find it worthwhile."
3,good only as a shield....,"It seem pretty obvious that with this mini-con group, that Hasbro was trying to make a shield first, and robots later. I have had nothing but difficulty with this team in trying to transform then(unclear instructions, especially with Dirt Boss), and keeping them together (I had a part on each one fall off at least once).However, if you don't even waste your time tryig to transform them into robot mode, you're much better off. This group is much better off transformed into the Skyboom shield, great for any Maxcon or larger. Also, once they're in Shield form, don't bother undoing it, unless you have the patience to re-assemble Downshift and Dirtboss.overall, if you get them to make the Skyboom shield, you won't be let down. If you're looking for only mini-cons, look elsewhere"
5,Enter the Skyboom Plane,These were my first mini-cons and still no peices have broken off that is why a gave it a five in durablity. A five in educational because of the comic that comes with it. They are fun because I got Red Alert with it so making Skyboom and attaching it to Red Alert makes him look really strong. In all this is definitly a mini-con team to get.P.S. PLEASE NOTE THAT IT IS THE SKYBOOM PLANE NOT THE SKYBOOM SHIELD!!!!
3,Overall Rating,"I had ordered this product for lifting quesadillas with ease.The lifter works beautifully for that. However, it is rather flimsy.I also received 2 of these, when I ordered only one. Amazon was great about sending me out a return label. I had no problems sending the 2nd one back."
5,Large Spatula,I got this cake lifter for my daughter for Christmas. She is a baker extroidinaire and will find many ways to use this supersize spatula. The quality as usual for Nordic Ware is excellent. Thanks for a great product.
2,what is it good for?,"I thought this was a pretty good idea for moving cakes from rack to plate or plate to plate. But it's so heavy, it really isn't practical. It might work for a single layer, but the weight of the lifter plus a whole cake is too much.I think it might work well for pizza or something like that, but I haven't tried it."
5,Perfect for my smoker to remove items.,This arrived sooner than I expected. I am very pleased with this item. It is very well made and will be able to hold the weight if the meat (any item) I have to remove from my electric smoker. No more worries about dropping it before I can get it on the serving tray.
5,Helpful,actually used this to transfer pies in and out of the oven. Pie tins are a little slippery but it worked great.
4,my son loves it,"I am so happy that he loves this thing. quality isn't bad- it falls down but you just pick it up and it's back to normal. it has devolped a small tear where you insert the poles- I wish they made the poles more flexible it would help alot and it wouldn't have torn, but my kid loves it and that's all that counts."
1,This tent is a piece of junk! Don't waste your money.,I bought this tent for my 16 month old because he loves Mater and Mcqueen. He can't even go in and out of it without it falling down. I'm returning it for the Thomas the Tank tent.
1,Beware -- Falls down constantly,"Great idea for a ""tent"" in theory, however, the two poles provided do not actually keep the tent from falling over. My son loves it, but it doesn't keep me from having to constantly pick up the tent to reset it."
2,Comment,When I received the book Some pages had been teared off. around ten pages. I did not expect that much of less quality
3,Interesting but inaccurate,"A good book written by an interesting character. The book is very comprehensive, well organized and is relatively easy to read. Anything you could want to know is here. However, some sources indicate that the author made up much of the material and created fictional characters. I hope most of it is true, the stories are fascinating. Anyone with a passion for the sea or an interest in pirates should check this out."
1,Advertisement,"This video is essentially an extended advertisement for EarthLink. If you want to use the Internet via Earthlink, this is a good video for you; if you do not, it isn't."
4,It has got to be good from what i here,I have many words about this book (and the awsome game) So if u have time to read get this book at least that is what my friends are saying.....
4,"Great fun, in a dark sort of way...","Loved the movie. Just the thought of coming home to find your boyfriend dead in the kitchen, and - just as you're about to call the police - realize that you can't remember anything from the night before or that same day. I could surely sympatize, having recently had a bit of a black-out due to too much wine. Elizabeth Pena's paranoia is truly convincing, and everybody else does great jobs. It ain't perfect, but then what is?"
5,I loved this film!,"Having your main squeeze stab ya in the gut, and being too blind to see what she's done, is something I can relate to!"
1,dull and silly bad acting,unfortunately elliot gould is making poor films and it seems there is a pattern
1,The duct tape is just showing signs of wear.,... The freaking handle broke... the belts have been replaced 3 times and now it is dead. By the way I have owned this vac for 2 years and I am a single 23 year old that NEVER VACUUMS!
5,"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!","This vacuum turns on a dime. A wonderful vacuum. It made our traffic areas stand tall once again. I haven't used all of the attachments, yet. But, the hose is great and extends to the ceiling. I'm a shortie - so I need all the help I can get! All of the attachments have tight fitting places for them to stay put. The light is great and it is quieter than my old vacuum (but it still scares the cat!). I love this thing! BUY IT NOW!"
4,What? This is a great Vaccum for the price!!!,"I don't know why this vaccum has gotten these bad reviews. The people must be vaccum abusers or something. I've had this vaccum for years and neglect it often and it is still doing great. If it clogs they are super easy to get out and just today, about 4 years after I purchased it do I need to buy a new belt. For the price you won't find anything better. The attachments are great and it keeps my house nice and spify. We allmost sprung for a new one but I popped the hood and it was just a belt that needed replaced. (It's the first time I popped the hood after 4 years too) To get a clog out of the tube you can just take it off and give it a shake, if that doesn't work I put the end of my broom through it and the clog is gone. For a cheaper vaccum this one really does the job!!! I've even sucked up legos! This is the only one you will need."
2,You get what you pay for,"I know why my mother always said to buy the [costly]machines ... This swivels beautifully, the attachments are easy to reach, it's not too heavy, it does a great job on carpets of various piles.BUT, it performs poorly on floors. In 18 months I've lost count of the number of times we've replaced broken belts. The scuff guard fell off and we had to replace the brush/roller within a year because it broke. This all occured with once weekly use, I wasn't trying to [vaccuum] up banana peels!This is great for a dorm room or your grad school apartment, but if you're looking for something to last, this isn't the machine for you. Save your shekels and buy an Electrolux."
2,Worked great! Then stopped.,"I had this vacuum about a year and I loved it. It was inexpensive and worked well, and picked up my two cats' hair without a problem. Until it stopped turning one day when I got it out. Nothing I tried was able to salvage it."
1,Waste of money,was looking for a vac for car/furniture that had a hose attachment. Very disappointing performance. Could barely feel the suction on my hand much less pick up any dirt.
2,Dirt Devil,"I was disappointed with the vacuum. It is a good idea with the extension hose, but it does not have much power. And as others have commented, it is very noisey. I have an earlier model without the extension hose that works better. I do not recommend it."
1,Dirt Devil - The vacuum from hell,"This excuse for a cleaning tool is a waste of space, money and time. I used to own two of these and have since defered their ownership to the dump.The brush has too few bristles and although there is motor that sucks, it does not create enough vacuum to do the job.Overall, the whole dirt devil sucks.Mine were purchased over a decade ago and I am guessing they were made in the states. I am betting that the new ones are made in China after having their uselessness optimized. If that is possible."
4,Back to basics!,"I had one of these Dirt Devils for many years until one of the kids blew up the motor somehow - I think a chunk of something got vacuumed into it. Anyway, after buying a couple of other brands because I couldn't find what I wanted, I was really happy to see the new and improved hand-vac, at a decent price too. It still feels as heavy (good motor!) but the plastic housing looks cheap, and there's no little brush attachment for the hose, only an edge cleaner. The hose is too short to do much with it: awkward for a simple job like the stairs or doing high corners of windows, etc. There is a little loop fastener to keep the cord attached to the body of it, which is convenient. All in all I think I am happy with it, the main roller brush is better than the other brands, and that is what I wreally wanted, and I am able to use attachments from my main vacuum cleaner."
3,should be sold at the dollar store,"i wanted this vacuum so bad to do my stairs with, so i got it as a gift. it worked great for a while 5 months later it now has a loud buzzing sound when i turn it on. also i empty the bag all the time, and it doesnt always suck up the little crumbs. the car forget about it. its not worth the trouble it is kinda heavy to vacuum the car with, and the hose doesnt go very far."
2,Forget it for stairs!,I bought this item for vacuuming the stairs and it doesn't pick up any visible dirt. It's noisy too.
1,Dirt Devil Hand Vac,This is the worst vaccuum I've ever owned. It has little to no suction power and it's rediculously loud. My upright vaccuum is quieter than this. I don't recommend it at all to anyone. Dirt Devil shouldn't even make it anymore.
1,extremely loud,"It worked good, but it is annoyingly loud. Mine broke down a couple of days ago after only using it for a few months. I used it for my car and it did not get the sand or dirt out. I would not recommend this product for anyone."
1,Broke after one month,"I used this vacuum cleaner for one month before it broke. It was powerful but loud and heavy, and it vibrated like crazy. Finally it caught a tassel of my area rug and blew the motor. Definitely not recommend."
2,"""Ultra power"".....haha, that's a joke.","If only we had went online and look at these reviews before buying this little monster, we would ALL be a happier family. Not only is this thing LOUD, it SHRIEKS. I've gotten headaches from using this thing. And the suction power doesn't make up for it at all. I've had to pick up some pretty obvious dirt bits, while it just glides over/pushes it around. The hot air being blown in your face is also extremely unpleasent. Try being in a car in the middle of June with a furnace blowing in your face. The only thing you'll be happy with is the nice definition in your arm after having to carry this thing around. It's a work-out and a chore at the same time! The cord is also a complete hassle to roll up. So much so, we just throw it in the closet in a bundle. My mom even does this, and she folds socks...."
3,"Loud, Heavy & Bulky -- not a good car vac","This vacuum proved too loud, heavy and bulky. I almost never used the Devil as a normal handheld vac, instead opting to attach and use the included hose when cleaning carpet debris in my car. However, the hose is not long enough to comfortably vacuum your car without either holding the vacuum in one hand and vacuuming with the other, or placing the vacuum down inside your car as you vacuum (excruciatingly loud, and it seemed to effectively swirl/spew dust around my already dirty car interior -- disqualification, on both counts.) Running the unit for 20 minutes or so caused it to get very hot around the motor, and occasionally you could smell rubber. Also, the intake seemed to get clogged fairly easily when there was a lot of debris like cat hair, carpet fibers or string.All in all, not a desirable unit to own... (I don't own mine, any longer, for these reasons!)"
3,"Great on Stairs, Awful on Bare Floors","I bought this (to replace a dying DustBuster) so I could pick up bits of cat litter on the bathroom floor. I thought it was doing a fine job. But one day, after I'd had it for a week or so, I was cleaning in my bare feet, and felt individual pieces of litter flying at my ankles. The brush/rotator thingie was basically just launching little cat-litter missles onto whatever was behind it--in this case, me, and the carpet in the adjoining room. So much for cleaning!I like the Dirt Devil on (carpeted) stairs a lot, although it is really, really loud (I wear earplugs). It has a very long cord, so one can vacuum the whole staircase without having to unplug/re-plug. But I don't recommend it on bare floors.I guess I'll need to get another DustBuster!"
1,TOO Noisy,"Way too noisy for such a small vacuum! Does an ok job, the hose with an attachment works better than the vacuum itself. Again, way too noisy to use on a regular basis for any length of time. It will wake the dead!"
1,It started smoking!,"I was very dissatisfied with this product. I purchased it and within 45 seconds of the first use, it began to smell awful. I turned it over and realized it was literally smoking. Not only was it defective, but also dangerous.Needless to say, I returned it and got a refund."
1,Bad Buy,"Good suction but the rotary brush has no power, it barely rotates when contacting carpeting."
1,Worst Dirt Devil Hand Vac Ever!,"I purchased this unit for inside since the 12volt model works great. This one doesn't work at all with the accessory hose and attachments. Little or no suction at all. The bag doesn't keep all the dirt inside, it ends up around the air exhaust and has to be cleaned with tweezers before after each use. I would send it back but don't want to accept partial credit and have to pay for return shipping."
4,Dirt Devil Handheld,This is the most powerful handheld vacuum that I have ever used. It does the job. to get this power you have to give up portability. You are tied to the wall via the power cord which limits its use. I keep it in the garage and find it handy and useful there.
5,Great Vacuum for Small Spaces,I purchased this product because I was tired to dragging my big vacuum up the staircase to clean the stairs. This has a rotary brush like a big vacuum with lots of suction so it cleans my staircase great and it is not very heavy. I have had this for a little while and I have had no problems with it whatsoever. Dirt Devil makes good products and I am happy with it.
2,NOT as powerful as the name might suggest !,"Although the material used to make this vacuum is durable, this vacuum is VERY noisy and lacks the power needed to do a good job. This vacuum contains a rotating brush at the front underside of the device. This device can be transformed handily to use a small hose crevice tool which comes with this vacuum for the purpose of cleaning smaller areas. However, this device has the suction power of lousy cheap hand vacuums. This vacuum is only ideal for light vacuuming jobs - maybe for light pet hair. I bought it for more than that, especially since I do not own a pet. I feel like I wasted my money."
1,Don't waste your money on this.,The brush is air driven so when you place the vac. on the carpet it stops spinning. Was told by the manufacturer not to place the vac. directly on the carpet that there should be a gap between the carpet and the vac. so that the brush could roll!! Product is junk!
2,cheap cost = cheap product,I bought this because my parents had a similar dirt devil handheld that has lasted upwards of 20 years. Unfortunately I could tell upon opening the box that dirt devil has apparently lowered their standards. Within about 15 minutes of vacuuming the vacuum started to smoke and smell. I exchanged it for another and I'm continually having to clean the brush roller to keep it from burning out the motor. I've been extremely disappointed and I'm glad I'm now in an apt without stairs to vacuum so I no longer have to use it.
1,Buy the Classic - not this one,"How can this vacuum work when the brush stops turning as soon as it touches the carpet? Give me a break! The brush is driven by the suction of the vac, not the motor. It's a very bad design. It's also bulky. Buy the Classic. It is a real performer and it comes with attachments as well."
1,This vacuum DOESN'T suck!,"The problem is that vacuums are suppose to suck, as in have suction. I hate bagless vacuums and this was the only hand held I was able to find with bags. But I am not even going to buy any more bags. I used the one which came with the product and I don't need to buy any more to know that this vacuum is a waste of my time. I use the Eurika Quick Up and that works fine, except that it is bagless."
1,This thing sucks...or doesnt suck,vry dissapointed in this hhv....lots of noise little suction power it was also spittibg back out the little thing it was suxking up abd horrible battery life u get wha chu pay for
3,"Good enough for light jobs, with some disadvantages","I bought the Dirt Devil because I wanted a small vacuum cleaner that had the power that comes from an outlet, not a rechargeable (and usually weak) battery pack.The Dirt Devil does a decent, though noisy, job of quick clean up and is definitely more powerful than most handhelds. However, the ""snout"" is too close to the handle and bag, making it sometimes awkward to maneuver. To use the onboard attachment, you need to flip the cover over the beater and unhook the accordion-style, expandable tube. Dirt Devil has improved this model over previous ones by making the tube less likely to detach during use. The power cord is sufficiently long for most jobs. Note that this uses bags. I recommend purchasing extra bags at the same time to make sure that you'll have them.As handhelds go, the Dirt Devil is a good choice. But I continue to use my regular vacuum cleaner for most jobs simply because both require the same effort."
2,Noisy and Weak!,"I needed something small, portable, and powerful for vacuuming my carpeted stairs. Dirt Devil has always been a reputable name in small vacuums, so I settled on this one.I purchased this product yesterday and tried it on my stairs last night-- it is going right back to Target tonight. First, it is SO LOUD! Unbelievably loud! My poor cats went into hiding for a good part of the night after I turned it on. Second, it has terrible suction-- the hose attachment is useless, which is a shame, because I was anxious to use that when cleaning the crevices of my stairs...Anyway, it was noisier than even my regular full-sized vacuum cleaner, and I thought something was wrong with it until I came here and read the reviews.So, back to Target it goes tonight, and my search for a handy, powerful vac will continue."
2,Dirt Devil,"This is so loud it hurt my ears to use it. I had one years ago that I liked so I don't know what they did to increase the noise, but unless you are completely deaf I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Bad design,This machine began to burn up during the second use. My son took it apart and discovered that the belt drive design almost guarantees belt dislodgement and failure. Unable to return so the money is lost.
4,THIS VACUME REALLY SUCKS!,"FORGET THOSE DUSTBUSTERS AND CORDLESS VACS!....IF YOU NEED A VACUME THAT'S NOT GOING TO QUIT,OR RUN OUT POWER IN THE MIDDLE OF A JOB,THIS IS THE PRODUCT TO BUY!..WORKS GRAT EVERY TIME...CAN DO EVERY JOB WITH THE ATTACHMENTS...GREAT FOR THE CAR AS WELL"
5,Good for stairs,"I brought this Dirt Devil Ultra Power handheld vacuum a month ago and I was looking for something that would be easy to clean the stairs with carpet so I found this vacuum and its works great for stairs with carpets. The big vacuum is a pain in the neck because its heavy and awkward and the hose is not very long to reach for cleaning the stairs, so this small Dirt Devil hand vacuum works great and Its has a hose too for reaching tight corners and great for cleaning inside cars because its suck up dirts and animal hairs so strong. The cons about this vacuum is loud. The pros is small and light and has a bag instead of buying paper bags this bag reuse again. Its easy to store away in closet."
2,very noisy vacuum,Just got this vacuum because I have an old dirt devil hand vac that is at the end of its useful life and was made in the USA. This one is not made in the USA. I am going to return it because it is so loud it actually hurts our ears. I wish I could get one exactly like my old Dirt Devil hand vac made in the USA. We have used it for many years.
4,Dirt Devil Hand Vac,"Overall very satisfied with product as it is hard to purchase in a retail store. Disappointed that it came with no packing slip/paperwork from Amazon as it was a gift and if something would have been wrong with it, it would have been difficult to return."
1,Buy the Shark or anything else,"We bought this product to replace the Shark vac ($30) because the Shark broke after a year, and the Shark product's customer service, based in India, was horrendous. I was looking for something sturdy; the Dirt Devil is very sturdy. I've used the Dirt Devil in my home office near the cat litter box for a year and I'll probably go back to the Shark. Dirt Devil will probably never die. It is loud (our dog views it as the Anti-Christ,) requires a cord, and either spills or up-chucks a bit of the cat litter after each use. Currently, I use the Dirt Devil for areas around the litter box and then use my regular vac to clean the spills from the Dirt Devil and to go over the rest of the room. Buy the green Shark, keep it plugged in EXCEPT when you use it, and expect to replace it annually."
1,Astonishingly noisy for such a weak vacuum,"Or, astonishingly weak for such a noisy vacuum.I bought this to replace a Black & Decker 'Collector' whose motor had burned out. Big mistake. While the brush part spins okay and picks up lightweight debris (lint and paper), the hose extension has very little suction. Not recommended."
3,Dirty Devil,"Not as powerful as the old dirt devils, but does the job OK. If the suction was better it would get 5 stars however my carpet on my steps are way to thick for this type of dirt devil. It comes to a complete stop when applying pressure to it."
5,vacuum review,received on time. I purchased this vacuum as a gift for my daughter-in-law who was borrowing my older version which I have had for many years.
2,Dirt Devil Ultra,"Good product, Like the on-board hose.Purchased to replace original Dirt Devil, Made in USA,New one ,Made in China, Shame on you!"
4,Good hand vacuum!,I really LOVE this Dirt Devil. I was taken back and concerned that it came with no packaging. The vacuum was just stuck in a Dirt Devil box. Thought for a second it was used.Nice for nooks and crannies!
5,Works in the Barn too!,I had one of these sitting around the office for cleaning company vehicles and because animal vacs are so expensive I decided to try it on my horse. The rotating brush works awesome! It fits right in my tack trunk. This is one powerful little sucker! A little awkward for small areas and hard to reach angles.
4,Nice for the car,I cut down on some expenses recently and that included weekly car washing. I needed a good vac to still take care of the carpets with pet hair and this little guy seems to be the best for the price. A few passes over an area and its just like the pro service. I have another dirt devil and that works good too.
1,Roller brush clogs easily,"I bought this mainly to clean up bird seed from the carpet. I liked the fact it was electric, not rechargable. I stopped using it after only a couple of uses because it got very hot and was noisy and the roller brush clogged very easy and wouldn't turn. When that happened it barely picked up anything. I even took it apart and the next time I tried to use it it immediately clogged again. Couldn't find the receipt so I'm stuck with it. The only thing it's good for is the trash!!!"
2,Not an improvement over the classic modle.,"Having owned this modle for a while I have found it to have more noise than power. It dosent pick up pet hair that well on low or high speed because the belt slips I have replaced it many times but it still slips, suction is only best on high speed (but its still not good), its lighter than the classic dirt devil but vibrates badly, it sounds like its ready to explode on high speed, the only things I liked about it was the cord and hose are stored on board. I dont recomend this modle at all it sucks (and not in a good way)."
3,Handy but loud,"I bought the Dirt Devil because I needed a hand vac. One reason I bought this one was because it had a cord, rather than a rechargeble battery. Rechargebles eventually die. When I got it home, I found it used a disposable bag rather than a reusable one - a minor annoyance. When I turned it on, it was louder than my full sized vac. Donning ear plugs or a hearing protector I have, helps a lot. It does shoot out some heat from the motor, which is nice in the wintertime. I like the rotating brush - good for carpets. Sucking power is decent. Hopefully if it's treated with respect, it will hold up. (A little vac like this shouldn't be expected to do the work of a big vac)."
2,No good if you have pets,"Me and my mother purchased this vac for the stairs and it is very loud and annoying. Also I think it breads dust mites and smells like dirty dog, I dont think it has any sort of filter. It doesnt clean close to the edges at all and it leaves the stairs dirty, and they are pretty clean to begin with, we only have a short haired boxer and it doesnt pick up her hair well. She also hates the sound of this vac."
1,FIRE HAZARD,"I bought this vac to help clean up behind my 19 month old daughter and my 2 pets. I used it once without a problem, seemed to work reasonably well for a hand vac. The 2nd time I used it I was cleaning up kitty litter tracked from the litter box. The 1st pass went fine but then as i was getting ready to make a 2nd pass to finish the job it started whining and it stopped working. I turned the machine off, checked for any clogs or hair of any kind that may be causing the interference but i found nothing. I manually moved the brush around a couple of times without a problem, so i turned it back on. It was still not working and then within 2 seconds it started to smell like something was burning. I turned it off and it was smoking pretty heavily, which lasted for at least 2-3 minutes before cooling off. Don't waste your $$ on this and more importantly don't risk your safety with this fire trap."
2,Too noisy!,Don't waste your money on this machine. I picks up ok but is too loud. I bought it to vacuum the stairs in my house and it does a poor job. There is only suction in the middle and doesn't pick up anything on the edges.
3,I couldn't wait to breath,"This is a very relaxed story of 2 African American women and one teenager. Moxi a divorced mom trying to raise her daughter Zadi, while teethering on the brink of depression.Norma, wife, mother and bestfriend of Moxi since college face some very hard truths that puts hers and Moxi's friendship on the line.Zadi, Moxi's daughter has to deal with peer pressure. Making a decision about sex, she would not normally make under different circumstances. Zadi tells us her story from her diary.One incident changed the lives of six people, infidelity caused a strain on a friendship, lies dampered a relationship, and depression caused a suicide.I think as a debut Patricia did a good job of writing about the things that effect us all: sins of our mothers, growing up and learning the power to forgive."
4,It was ok,"Breathing Room is about Norma, and her friend Moxi. Norma is a photographer, and married to Lawrence, but is cheating on him with a white guy, to Moxi's big disapointment. Moxi dosen't like white people, plus she thinks Lawrence is a wonderful guy. Moxi is also trying to raise her daughter Zadi to be a strong black woman. Readers learn alot about Zadi through her journal entries that are written throughout the book. I really liked this book, but sometime I felt like Moxi was a little overbearing, I felt like she wanted everyone to belive in her opinions on life, or what she throught a black person should act like, or they were total failures, she didn't want her daughter to be who she wanted to be but what she wanted her to be."
4,Good Book: Slow Start!,Basically its a very good book! You may get a little lost in the beginning but if you keep going you'll learn to love the characters and you'll be on the edge of your seat to read what happens next!!! I would definitely recommend this book!
5,A loving look at a fantastic band,"This documentary, made by a long-time fan of the band, takes you through Keane's beginnings as a guitar band to its evolution to a piano/vocals focus. The bandmates provide insight into the long road between its first gig and the American tour featured in the film and you get a glimpse into the effects of success and endless touring. There are enough interview segments to get a sense of each performer and how they relate to each other as lifelong friends. And, of course, the gorgeous music of Keane is played throughout with lots of live concert clips and full versions of their songs as well. I loved it."
2,too much documentary,"The item is a two DVD set. Each disc has doumentary info, live performances and videos. You are able to see the documentary and the live performances in each disc from the main menu. But if you want to see the videos you are forced to watch the dcoumentary. Terrible way to lay out this item. It would have been best to put all the music (live and videos) in one disc and the documentaty on the other.The quality of the music and videos (when you can get to them) is very good."
5,Colorfull Gems of Nature,"Like ""Living Mammals of the World"", another zoological must if only for the shear beauty of the photography. You'll never look at reptiles in the same light again after delving into this classic. Covers every family branch, from snakes and lizards to turtles and crocodiles. A fascinating reference source, though many new species are still being classified. A favorite library choice during my school years."
5,Great buy.,"Excellent buy. Performed exactly as I thought and as the reviews indicated. A little slow in getting to me, so if in a hurry look elsewhere."
4,Air Defence Mini-Con Team,I thought this toy was great because it came with 3 minicons and they could all transform into the star saber sword that could be held by the regular transformer figure. However the pieces can come of easily if you but to much force on a part and when they become the sword the bottom part Sonar can't hold on to the other parts that well.
4,Just one thing....,"This set of Mini-Cons is great. Just one thing. Since the Star Saber version is out of production, (or maybe it was just me) you'll like get the Dark Saber version. Same toy, different paint scheme. Best part about the new paint scheme? Goes EVEN BETTER with the Decepticons!"
3,"more work on the design, then i'd consider a toy",tiny minicon jets. they combine with transformers sold seperatly and fuse with eachother. well? no. the dumb sonar or diffrent looking one is the handle of there fusion sword. it inserts into certain transformer (sold seperatly) hands but it won't fuse with the other two minicon things. then i tried taking a small poket knife to hollow out the handle thing and when i tried to fuse again it was too loose.
2,star saber,"this thing stinks, dont get it, cuz its horrible and it looks horruble when u make it into a star saber!"
3,"cool looking, but FRUSTRATING!","this has much potential to be a great toy, but at least my figures have issues... they look good in jet form, they look good in robot form, they look good in sword form... but once they're in sword form the handle doesn't fit into the hand of either of the figures I own, Megatron and Starscream... I don't know if some figures are made for the StarSabre and some aren't, but right now all I have is a decent looking sword that can't be carried by any Transformers..."
4,Good,"Cheaper than walmart to buy it here, and the exact same item. Moves a LOT of air on high, quiet enough on the lowest setting to sleep with it on."
5,Does the job,"I have no instruments to measure this, but this air cleaner seems to take in a large volume of air and clean it very effectively with HEPA filter. It has three speeds and can be anything from quiet and ready to maintain the clean air to very loud and able to clean dirty air. White color helps it look less like an industrial item in a bedroom."
1,OMG! Not ANOTHER cultural proficiency book for educators!,"OMG! Not ANOTHER cultural proficiency book for educators! This is the junk science of the week! Tell me Randall, I have been gone from the country on business for over a month and need to know the new politically correct labels for other cultures. Is it still African-American this week or did it change? How about Native American? I recommend not reading this book as the pages are glued shut from all the intellectual masturbation."
3,Wrong edition.,"The book is in great shape, but I received the wrong edition. I kept it anyway because the difference is acceptable."
2,Cupcake Papers,These do not fit in a regular cupcake pan. Had to fill them and place them on a cookie sheet to bake them.
2,"hobbled design, missing parts","these are lightweight folding sawhorses, but the design is hobbled by the hinged top and the failure of Stanley to include FOUR extender tabs instead of two (what kind of crack are the suits at Stanley smoking nowadays? obviously none of them have ever used a sawhorse)...any woodworker knows that sawhorses sometimes are used w/large C-clamps and a couple 2-by-4s to extend the width and support area... i bought these thinking i'd be able to clamp some extra wood onto the top surface area to support building a small dinghy...but you CAN'T with these! there is no way to reliably clamp a 2-by-4 to the tops of these horses, and the horses-you-know-whats at Stanley ensured your frustration by only including two extenders!if you want a set of lightweight sawhorses for modest use to refinish a small piece these may work for you...but don't expect to put this product to work..."
3,What were they thinking?,"I'd like to second several statements already made -- why on earth would Stanley not provide 4 adaptors for the top rails so that sawing could be performed w/o destroying the rail? My (poor) solution is to mount plywood strips to the tops with cable ties, so that 1) they can be easily replaced, and 2) no damage to blades will occur when I hit the ties. I haven't, however, yet figured out how to make clamping to the underside of the top rails more effective, as this is a pivot point and cannot be covered with plywood etc. I hate to sound like just another wanker, but this truly does reveal a disconnect between the suits at the company and the folks that actually use the products sold."
3,Good but not so good,"Don Bousquest at his best. I gave it as a gift for a former Rhode islands and she was very pleased. The only problem I had was that it was said to be ""new"" and it was obviously used and worn."
5,THE Soundtrack!!!,"Hypnotic, moody, instrumental - you have to listen to this soundtrack!!! It is so expressive that you literally need no lyrics to tell the story. If you do watch the movie you would find no dialogues and you would understand why the soundtrack needed to be so expressive. I love listening to it because it never gets old... You do not really need to be a Satanist or a devil worshiper to understand the beauty of those notes and the mood they put you on. There is nothing evil in them, no agression, just a simple self human expression. Whoever recorded this album was truely playing from hers (his) soul and was able to deliver what was required to make one of the best soundtracks that I have EVER heard. Buy this record and sink into the best music you have EVER heard!!!"
5,Staple Goofed,I got this thing from staples for 50 dollars! i think they were supposed to charge 150 so SHOPPERS - check staples b4 you buy here. you may get lucky as i did. also this thing is awsome. its a lot better than the ones that you pay over 200 for and its a powerful little guy. i easily give it 5 stars. and the batteries last a long time.
3,okay product,This product is okay for begginer users and people who don't need many applications. It drains batteries fast like 14 hrs. and doesn't have many games. I also had many problems well I hot syncned it.
5,Pink helio rewiew,"The pink helip made by VTech has many functions and characterists such as a caculator, To Do List, and organizer. It is a simple way of getting what you need and getting it done fast. You can simply carry it around where ever you go, and it is easy to be held in your purse or handbag. This helio deserves 5 stars!"
5,GREAT PDA!!!,"This is by far the best value for ANY PDA I've researched. It's extremely user-friendly, nicely priced, and PC compatible in approximately 5 minutes. I didn't even have to read the manual to start the system up, and I'm no techie! Another plus is that the accessories (extra touch pens, cases, etc) are much cheaper as well. It's got all the functions a Palm has (for about half the price!) and even a 24-hour tech support line and website (www.vtech.com)."
4,I still use mine,I actually have 2 of these. And i still use one of them. If only other electronics can last 7 years after day to day use. The only thing that ive had longer is my tv.
1,A frustrating disappointment,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. In fact, I advise against buying ANY Helio or VTech product. On top of selling a product that has yet to run properly in the two months that I've owned it, Helio's customer service and technical support is a travesty. They simply do not care if you are unhappy with their product and are not focused on improving your situation or making their customers happy. I am in the midst of sending scathing letters to the President, head of customer service and head of technical support demanding a full refund. Amazon.com should no longer carry these products."
4,For the electronicly challenged,"I have to admit that I am among those out there who are electronic challanged and have given up hope, until now. I bought the Helio with the hopes of being able to use the phone book and the calculator and have found it easy to use the rest of the applications as well. I was even able to install the needed programs into my computer. The only draw back is that it did not come with a printed manual, just a quick start reference, so I ended up making memos on how to do certain tasks. But if you are like me and alittle overwhelmed by most modern technology you will probably find this helpful, compact and easy to use. It also backs up your files into your PC easily just in case."
4,A Review for the VTech Helio,"The VTech Helio Handheld computer is a great investment to have. It really helps you stay organized and with things. The Helio is great for teens and adults because of its low price. It's not quite as elaborate as the Palm Pilot III, but has some of the same functions in a more simple fashion. The VTech Helio also comes in many bright and flashy colors that would catch anyone's eye. Overall, the Helio is an inexpensive and yet productive handheld computer."
4,Response to Icatal,"I just wanted to say, in response to Icatal's post, that I got the Helio as a Christmas present, am currently on day 9 of usage, and have not had to change the batteries once. I don't know why his batteries were only lasting for 36 hours, but I have not been having that problem."
1,Sent it Back!,"I was very impressed with the features that the Helio had for the advertised price. No other PDA can compare. Unfortunitely, the Helio would constantly get several system error alarms that would lock up the device. I was initially so impressed that I encouraged a friend to purchase one. He experienced the same problems and is now on his second Helio and it eats batteries big time. I sent mine back and am now in the market for a new PDA. If Vtech works out the bugs, the Helio will definately be the best PDA for your buck."
3,automatically updates to the latest version.,"ORIGINAL REVIEW of September 30, 2006 -> I am running it on an winxp pro. The ""suite"" appears to be eager to block a lot of programs. However, it is easy to lift the block. It is not clear to me how to make it more flexible.Rated well by professional reviewers.When I bought it from Amazon, I believe it was version 6.0. 3-4 weeks ago, it asked me to download and upgrade it to a 6.5. This went on without a hitch. I think that they do not label it by the CALENDAR year.ADDED NOTE ON MARCH 31, 2007 ->Yesterday, it asked me to upgrade it to version 7 (without $) and a clean new install after the downloaded upgrade. I am a little more familiar with the software now, after several months of use."
2,Resource hogging spoils good product,"If you don't have at least 1Gb of memory or you don't like having your machine taken over and become unusable for minutes at a time then don't buy this product. The AVG equivalent product is far, far less obtrusive in operation.The plus side of zonealarm is the firewall automated configuration is excellent but sadly the infuriating, ongoing and frequent machine-killing antiviral and update interventions far outweigh the benefits of the one-time setup advantages over AVG."
2,not good with games,"I liked the security that ZA SS gives but you cannot play games or use other programs when it is on nor even in game mode. I tried to contact the technical support via email but after a week, no respone from them(which they say may take up to 3-4 days anyway). Through chats, I also learned to just install a lower version of ZA (like 6.5) and it will solve the problem."
1,peoplepc users be aware!,"If you are using peoplepc for your isp provider, you may want to read this email I received when I contacted zone alarm techical support after experiencing a blue screen system crash after installing the Zone Alarm Internet Security suite on my Windows XP pro operating system:""Thank you for your inquiry. Yes, unfortunately there is an issue where having peoplepc and Zone Alarm will cause the system to crash. The only remedy is to run version 6.1 or lower or get a refund for the software. I apologize for the inconvenience...."" I will be returning my Zone Alarm software back to Amazon in the next couple days in hopes of securing a refund."
1,"Zone Alarm, the Rip Off Company","My experience with Zone Alarm Security Suite was horrible. My computer had a trojan that Zone Alarm could NOT treat or quarantine. I finally figured out how to treat it manually. Unfortunately, I had to perform this manual operation on a weekly basis because when ZA did its weekly scan, it would resurrect the trojan, i.e. free it from its jail.When Microsoft discontinued their support of Windows Me in July 2006, ZA also discontinued their support of my computer, even though they still owed me five months of support in 2006. I asked for a refund and they refused to at least give me credit for the five months of no support.In January 2007, I installed CA Antivirus Suite for 2007. My wife is much happier with her computer that has Windows XP. ZA was a nightmare for her. She absolutely hated the way ZA operated (as noted by other reviews)."
1,regret,"i bought this item because my husband heard is the best internet security. Now i regret buying one. Since ive installed it, IT SLOWED MY COMPUTER, ITS VERY VERY HARD TO CLOSE WINDOW AND WORSE WHEN I DISCONNECTED FROM THE INTERNET I HAVE A HARD TIME LOGGING OFF. everytime im on the internet,i get mad and upset. its not worth all the stress. i definitely dont recommend this product. now im trying to figure how i can return the product and go back to NOrton."
1,Get the free Zonealarm & Spybot (for a donation),"In the last year I have tried this program, PC-Cillin & four sharewares from CNET, and f-ZA the only one that doesn't cause more problems than it solves. The others prevent me from doing wireless printing, slowdown the computer & generate false alarms."
3,Zonelab Service What Service? None!,Received this item 2 weeks ago. Found out that is was the 2006 version and not the 2007 as advertised.Contacted Amazon and they said I could return it for a full refund. They would also pay for the return shipping. I contacted Zonelabs by E-mail. Now two weeks later still no response other than the next day acknowledgement of receiving my mail. The product has some flaws and often reduces internet transmission excessively. Update: Now four weeks have past and still no response from Zone Labs
4,Zone Alarm Security Suite Review,"The system does what it claims. The firewall works good, the pop-ups are blocked, and it will give you warnings on just about everything. Although the warnings can be a bit overwhelming, you can program exactly what you wish or don't wish to allow. You can also choose to click a box that says to allow or deny similar activity if it comes up again. I think it's worth the money, though I don't know how it compares to other products out on the market."
1,Warning innaccurate labeling NOT Vista ready,"I bought this software and the box said it is ""Vista Ready"". Apparently that means the company is working on version for Vista but has no idea when it will be available and the software in the box will NOT run with Vista. It won't even install. It's useless and now I have to pay for shipping to return it as well as the tax from the original purchase. Useless software if you are running Vista and not helpful customer service for returns."
2,The mighty Zonealarm has fallen,"I gave this version a try and noticed more draw backs than good things. For one my pc took alot longer to boot up. Also when I tried to click on links to youtube videos, using firefox, I was just shown a page full of script. On the youtube site itself videos displayed the ending message and I had to click on the play again button just to get them to run one time. Sometimes these videos would stop in the middle or restart as well. I uninstalled the product, reinstalled my old security suite package and the problems vanished. They couldn't pay me enough to take this package off of their hands. I'm glad I had a chance to test it before making the mistake of purchasing it."
1,Worst security software ever,"This program has been a headache since day one. It is miserable to configure, hogs resources, freezes my system, and removes privelages to use other programs. To spite having given every aspect of Adobe full permission, I cannot browse a .pdf file online. I have to save it locally and then open it. Annoying but doable - except that one has to be able to view a .pdf file online to print postage from the USPS website. Then I try to download and install an update - Nope! Not allowed - insufficient privelages as the admin. No joke. My very nice laptop has been all but useless since this piece of trash was installed. I tried to get support but they want me to pay $2.95 a minute to speak to someone, my problems are listed, so I am suppose to spend the next several days emailing with someone? Seriously? This product is trash. Go buy Trend Micro."
4,Zonealarm review,"This product allows the consumer to purchase a firewall, antivirus software, anti-spyware, and additional security all in one package. Very easy to use!"
1,!WARNING! Not the Zone Alarm We Once Knew! WARNING!,"I am an experienced computer professional and beta tester and ZA 7 is an unmitigated disaster. Issues clearly identified while in beta were not fixed when CheckPoint(an Israeli company which purchased ZA in 2004) released the ""gold"" version on Jan 15, 2007. If you do manage to get it working it uses anywhere from 80 to 170 MB of RAM! Then the so called ""Kaspersky"" antivirus database will corrupt. This makes Symantec products seem elegant.It is insult to injury when the arrogant attitude of tech support adds to the frustrations. The wall of silence from CheckPoint ZoneAlarm is stunning as they have still not fixed even one of the numerous problems.Steer clear. Try Comodo Firewall / AVG anti-virus or anything else but this."
4,"It works, though a little irritating","I'm a heavy internet user. I used Symantec Internet Security and System Works for as long as they've been available. About 18 months ago I got a message that roughly paraphrased said ""you just got a virus and there's nothing we can do about it."" I ended up having to reload all my programs from scratch. Not a big deal, the data was backed up, now I ghost as well. Point is Norton wasn't doing the job. Based on reviews, I switched to Zone Alarm.It works though it takes about a half hour to wade through setting it up. The default settings can be a nuisance, but Zone Alarm has worked flawlessly. I wish the price were lower, but as long as it works, it's well worth it."
3,Igniter only worked for one burner,"This would've been nice if the igniter worked for both burners. Everything else seems to work well. Texsport wins in the long run because the malfunction is not worth the work to return it. So, I'll keep it. Both burners work, just one of them needs an external flame to light it."
4,Good stove!!,"I ordered this stove and grill it took a while to showed up, but in time for our hike to grand canyon havasu falls.. amazing trip!! first I expected to be green and it was red no biggie it was hard to open the arms from each side and the grill were getting stuck in time and time again while trying to open ..very annoying, just because of that I almost return it, I am glad I didnt though. Work like a charm it is good quality in comparison to other junk out there..but only the grill is instal-light w ignition the stove is NoT you have to use a lighter everytime. In our hike we load up the horses w our staff and off they went on their own and it didnt get damage..So I recomended to anyone. Dont wait to long to clean it otherwise its a mess of a nightmare to clean it."
4,Cook it! Grill it!,"I received the stove/grill in record time and was in perfect condition. It was exactly as advertised. Is easy to use and fits my needs to a tee.Just a couple comments:1. The starter does not start the grill portion. You have to use either a match or lighter to get it going.2. It would be nice if the item had a carrying handle for easier transporting.3. The base does NOT get hot or even warm so you can place it on a table cloth without worrying about if it will catch fire.4. On the burner it took 5 minutes to bring a quart of cold water to a boil weather on full throttle or at half throttle. All the adjustments is in the first half settings.5. Keep watch on the grease catcher to insure it does not overflow when grilling. It could have been a bit larger.If a person wants both a grill and a burner, this is the perfect choice and I completely recommend it"
4,O.K.,My complaint is it is advertized as Insta-light stove and grill.I read other reviews that said that only the grill was insta-light. I thought maybe that was an older model and ordered it anyway. Sure enough you have to light the stove with something else.Other that that it meets my expectations.
1,Useless Software,"This software simply preys on handheld user's ignorance. There are no true PalmOS viruses out there. Save your money on this product and instead buy some form of backup solution. A Backup Module if you have a visor, Memory backup SD card if you have a more recent Palm device, or a Northstar backup module if you have an older Palm III series device. This software is completely useless. Get a good backup solution and you will be much safer than if you just had this software loaded on your handheld."
1,Terrible customer service,"This was a complete waste of my money. I have been unable to update the software since install. I continue to get that I am not registered. When I contacted McAfee I get ""we are mailing you instructions on correcting this"".. Well it's been a week and I've sent 2 emails, 1 live chat and still no emails back. Guess they want me to spend another $20 on a annual subscription."
4,Old time School buddies,"Jon & Bill, wheww!! Bill Charlap most innovative short of genius that ever touched weighted keys, Jon, a musical wolf wrapped in the bread of meekness. These heavenly sounds that we hear between Jon and bill are a continuation of what I heard from 1980-1984 at H.S. Performing Arts where both graciously and now continue to create music just like water flows over and around fresh creeks in mountains. All I can say is smooth, smooth, smooth."
2,Good product - battery life is terrible,"I ordered the Visor platinum based on speed, memory and expandabilty. I'm not disappointed in any of these criteria. However, in synching to MS outlook, it deleted my entire address book and calendar on my laptop. It was not recoverable. On top of this, I was only getting 4 - 6 days battery life even when it was used very little. I emailed Handspring requesting help but never heard from them.I returned the Handspring and ordered a Palm Vx. I anticipate it will perform as well as the Handspring but do look forward to longer battery life. I also don't anticipate any need for things like the Handspring expansion modules so expandability is no longer important."
4,DESTRUCTION TEAM,"The Destruction Team seem to have the most ominous vehicle modes of the Mini-Cons. Dualor and Buzzsaw are my favorite. I like Drill Bit but I think he deserved a more menacing cockpit. It looks innocuous. The poseability level is disappointing but these Mini-Cons make up for that with their unique movable parts when you roll them. Buzzsaw reminds me of AKoslin's (we go to the same school) FUTURE TRANSFORMERS Radicon named Raze. His VT (Vehicular Transformation) is a spiked wheel! How cool is that!?! It's way cooler than Hasbro's Buzzsaw. And when Raze becomes an Omega, his new VT's a spiked rim! Overall, this Mini-Con team is well worth the $. They're PERFECT for Cyclonus. He just looks so cool when attached with either of them. Buy these little guys before they run out of stock!"
2,Dirt Devil Featherlite Plus,"For a light weight, inexpensive upright vacuum, it does okay. I find the hose to be quite short and it pulls out easily when being used. There is no hose extension available from the company. Its rather noisey as well. I, personally, prefer a throw-away-bag to getting my hands dirty and have dust flying around cleaning those filters with the bagless type of vacuum so this suits my needs."
3,Very good but too LOUD,"The featherlite does a very good job on carpet, is very lite, its very clean and easy to change bags, and affordable. But it lacks a height adjustment knob, has no headlight, it needs another extension tube, the hose isn't conected to the power base, it needs a longer power cord, it cannot be used on bare floors, and I recommend you wear hearing protection when using it. other than that I think you should keep looking for a better vacuum unless you want a noisy, affordable, good cleaning vacuum"
1,The Bane of My Existence,"I really can't stand this vacuum cleaner. It worked the first few times I used it, but within six months the head of the vacuum cleaner would regular come flying off and run around the room on its own accord. Such a nightmare! And now the handle falls off. This is a cheap machine and is not worth $10, much less (the price). Buyer beware!"
4,FEATHER WEIGHT HEAVY DUTY CLEANING,"MY MOTHER HAS THIS VACUUM AND WITH 3 PUPPIES 2 KITTENS A 2 YEAR OLD SHE WATCHES, SHE HAS A LOT OF ""HEAVY DUTY CLEAN UPS"". MY MOTHER HAS ALSO HAD 2 SURGERIES ON HER WRIST FOR CARPEL TUNNEL AND THE ""FEATHERLIGHT"" VACUUM MADE IT EASIER ON HER. PLUS IT CLEANS UP THE MESSES GREAT! IM BUYING THE VACUUM BECAUSE OF GOOD EXPERIENCES AND GREAT RESULTS! THANK YOU DIRT DEVIL!"
1,Terrible! Cheap!,"I bought this vaccum one year ago to replace a similar version from Hoover. The Hoover vaccum had lasted 5 years. This one has lasted one year and is going to the dump.I have to admit in the beginning the Featherlite was really cool. It was a neat color, and was picking up better than my Hoover had been in it's last days. Boy was I fooled!My Featherlites final turn around my living room ended with smoke coming out the bottom and a terrible smell. It's now sitting in the driveway! I read a review on another website that this is due to bent parts in the motor. The reason the vaccum is so light is because they put a cheap motor inside!"
1,Mine lasted 6 months,"I purchased my Dirt Devil vacuum early this year and from the start was unhappy with it. It was so loud that my ears would ring for a few minutes after turning it off. We had to put the dog outside and the kids (2yrs. and 9mos.) in a back room with the door shut so as not to scare them whenever we used it.The vacuum motor finally burned out a couple of months ago. Luckily, we kept our old hand-me-down Electrolux vacuum that we have had for over 10 years and it still runs fine. I'll be replacing the Dirt Devil with another brand."
5,Bring yourself back to God...,"While stationed in Germany in the Air Force, I had a new missionary friend (who left the military to support God's plan...) let me listen to this album... I don't care if you like, dislike or have an indifference with Bluegrass OR Christian music... JUST TRY IT!! This group's unique ability to sing with perfect harmony, heart tugging lyrics and simple to the point messages is what will definitely bring you to your knees. This album was the first one that changed how I looked at a 'family' of Christians bent on getting God's message out... You WILL enjoy this album, it simply hits home and recommend it to any Christian looking to be inspired by God's concept...God Bless The Rochesters!"
1,Too small to work properly,"I bought this product for the price and convenience because I simply need to wean, however when I received it, i supposed it was a nostril bulb, and it definitely didn't work at all."
5,Love Conquers All,"You'll be drawn into this gripping story from the very first page. It's about two women whose love conquers all, even war in their homeland."
4,Works,"This product works well for me by stopping the progression of the cold. It does not cure the cold and you still must rest but you do feel much better,"
5,Cold Snap in a Snap,"I ordered Cold Snap and had it mailed to a relative in another state, cheaper than buying/mailing it from home. My relative got in time to relieve her symptoms. Great product, mailed and received quickly and easily. Would do it again."
3,Pretty standard vacuum tools,"Bought these to use with another vacuum. Works just fine. If you do get it for the dirt devil, the mounting holder is worthless."
3,Very handy tools,"These work real well with the older model of the Dirt Devil hand-vac, but with the newer model M08230X - Ultra Hand Vac, it doesn't suck well. I think the problem is with the vacumn, not the attachments.Also, these attachments does not fit other Dirt Devil model such as M084605 - Dynamite Quick Vac."
3,It's okay,"I thought my daughter would really like this toy becuase she loves putting things in anything. But suprisingly, this only keeps her attention for a few minutes at a time. I think maybe the balls just drop too fast and she doesn't get it. There isn't really a lot to do. She really loves the Peek-A-Blocks Giraffe. She will play with it for 20 minutes easily a couple times a day. Get that instead. This one just doesn't keep interest long."
4,my son loves it,"my son got this as a gift at about 6 month old and it took him a while to figure it out and now that he has figured it out he loves it, lol he is so proud of himself when he puts the balls in the bugs mouth. Also he sticks anything in the balls mouth lol his stacking rings anything that will fit goes into that bug, and it still hasnt broken and its six months later. I say def worth the buy!"
5,My Nephew LOVES this Toy,"my Nephew got this toy when he was (6 1/2 months old) as a PRE-christmas Gift and he loves it along with his other toys at first he had to fingure it out....but once it made the sound ""teehee..."" he Laughed! and played with it for hours at a time along with his baby blocks!! i love this toy because it easy to play with and clean when he gets shaken and pukes!! but over all its a great toy!!"
3,My toddler didn't get too into it,"I bought this several years ago for my son when he was a toddler (maybe even a little younger). I can see what the toy makers were going for, but he didn't really get too into this product. I would show him how to put the balls through the character's mouth, and sounds would play, and the balls would pop out at the bottom, but it never grabbed his attention. He wasn't too bothered when we decided to give it away when he had outgrown it."
1,Scraped,Came on time but the packaging was horrible. The top is scraped up.....Disappointing as it was a gift for my daughter.
1,not happy,the dip is in the in side of the top so a two layer cake wouldn't fit in it & that's the reason i order it i can't even use it so i am stuck with it
2,High Impact is a a bit of a stretch...,"I REALLY wanted to like this product despite other reviews, especially since it is made in the USA and I am trying really hard to buy American made. It arrived cracked, chipped and broken. Needless to say, I am returning it."
3,Not sure,We use the product in our baby's room on the floor near her crib. The moisture goes down the floor and dampens the floor. We have to use towels around it so the floor doesn't get ruined. Not sure if it's effective. Have to try it for myself. I just have no time to look for another product. Will have to keep this product until I find a better one.
4,is the ...,i think that the 3 pack street team is a very nice toy i think the person who likes transformers should get this toy i think this much toy is a very good toy because it is very much fun its cool even if you if you dont have transformers armada stuff well it worth your money. but you might want to be careful with the sk8 board the back where it clips to for perceptor in the middle may break off this transformeris the shi* yea
5,combiners in disguise,"This Mini-con 3-pack is really cool. It comes with High Wire, a BMX Bike, Grindor, a motorized skateboard, and Sureshock, a bright orange scooter. The three are really easy to transform, but, because of the simplicity, the educational value is low. However, in addition to being able to connect with larger Armada figures, they can combine with one another to form a five inch- high robot called Perceptor. He also is really easy to assemble. Of all the Mini-cons, I would highly recommend these three."
5,Mini-Cons ---------- Mini-RULE!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The 1st I saw these Mini-Cons --- I WAS IN SHOCK! They're so miniscule! I was expecting them to be a lot bigger. Their size impressed me like never before. I'm sure that when you first see them, you too will be shocked.Anyways, I purchased 3 of these. One for me to keep MIB, another for me to keep OOB (Out of the Box), and one for my dear friend since he loves skateboarding.Although Grindor, High Wire, and Sureshock have poor poseability they make up for that by merging together to create --- Perceptor. I especially like Grindor because of the name and also cos' I love skateboarding. Taking out a robot that transforms into a skateboard is no surprise for me since I had an idea like that for my Transformers stories. But I'm glad Hasbro came up with Grindor. I enjoy making my GIJoe figures ride on his vehicle mode.Perceptor is a very impressive robot but there's just one problem wth this trio. They have no weapons so how're they supposed to fight?"
2,Bland at best,"All in all, I picked up very few ideas from this generally bland manual, and the illustrations (clay figurish poseables) can, in their most flattering light, be described as abstract (or boring or unhelpful). There is not a single photo of an actual hockey player in the entire book. Large sections provide mostly-irrelevant info, in a well printed format trimmed in color. Towards the back their is some basic strategy that is useful, but as w/ many hockey manuals, these require a great deal of patience to piece together from the diagrams--nothing new."
3,hmm,"This book is a bit nuts. First, I want to say that the translation seems pretty good. I have read another version of one of the essays in here, and it was just awful. The reason I gave it three stars is that Shklovsky is sorta bonkers. His anti-mimetic stance on literature is violent and badly organized. He was trying to make a strong impression (and he did), but later Formalists seem to have their acts together a bit more than he did."
1,Not worth the money,"This was a huge waste of money. The cars do not sit well in the case, it is not easy for a 4-year old to open. Half of our cars broke within the first week of use, so this is just silly and unnecessary. We purchased it because this is what our son said he wanted more than anything--the darda racetrack with the car carrying case. After a month, he has zero interest in this toy."
4,Fun and creative,"This is a very cool product, but way over priced. It's much more expensive than buying the product already printed! I am producing a set for my family in France, with French words, and of course the name of the various people in the family, their hobbies and passions and dislikes... It's fun to personalize. It's quite easy to use their program for filling in the cards. We are fans of Apples to Apples because people from all ages can play, there is no right or wrong."
5,Fun cards!,"This product is fun! If you play the game, it's great to put in your own cards. I used them to insert names of TV characters into my existing deck. My friends were pleasantly surprised when they picked those cards."
4,"Lot's of fun, especially when you play all the time.","These cards are a must-have for any Apples to Apples addict. Our little group plays so often that we quickly exhausted the Party box and both expansion packs. These easy to print or write on customizable cards have been our saving grace and are of a similar card stock to our standard party box set. Definitely use a sharpie, and the inkjet printer is easy to use."
1,never used it,"I bought this with an Interplak toothbrush (which is wonderful), but I've never used it. The toothbrush is enough. The dentist says my teeth look great."
5,Love it!,"I accidentally happened on this movie while surfing early one morning. I was so taken by it that every time I found it, I would watch it. Finally, I BOUGHT it! Now I can watch it over and over--which I am doing. It's witty dialogue and finely-drawn characters are memorable and the hilarious situations Silas and Frank get themselves into, nostalgic. The story is so believable, you'll find yourself heading out to the Blue Quill on Saturday night!"
5,Very Good,"I watched it one night, well actually one morning when I couldnt sleep at like 1:00 in the morning. Ever since I saw it I have been trying to rent it or buy it. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen..and I thing about anyone will like it."
3,Adam Beach most annoying character,"I had watched parts of this movie when if first came out but didn't own a copy. I picked up this copy and watched the full movie- realizing what I initially guessed- that Adam Beach is a terrible actor. I kept thinking of Bevis and Butthead when watching him trying his bravado teenage (young adult?) antics, appearing more like a court jester than a serious character. Overall, the movie lacked depth but it could have been a lot better with a higher quality actor than Beach."
2,Bad spot in DVD,The movie it self was good but about 45 minutes in there was a very bad spot where it paused and finally skipped ahead so I missed part of the movie
5,A great movie about being a teenager on a rez.,This is the first native movie that has ever felt real to me. Characters seem recognizeable and familiar. Great adaptation from W.P.Kinsella's characters. I have all three of my thumbs up................... Rudy
5,DANCE ME INSIDE,EXCELLENT MOVIE I WOULD GIVE IT MORE THAN 5 STARS IF I COULD THE MOVIE IS THAT GOOD LIKE EVERYBODY SAYS ITS VERY EQUAL TO SMOKE SIGNALS I THINK THESE KINDS OF MOVIES SHOULD BE WATCHED IN OUR SCHOOL SYSTEMS TO TEACH CHILDREN ABOUT L I F E MAN IT AIN'T HARD BUT AIN'T EASY ROLL WITH THE PUNCHES AND MAKE THE BEST OF WHAT YOU HAVE AND BE THANKFUL FOR EVERYTHING YOU HAVE CAUSE EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON WE ARE ALL HERE FOR A PURPOSE AND ITS ARE PRIORITY TO FIND OUT WHAT AND WHY WITH PATIENCE AND UNDERSTANDING SOUNDS LIKE BS HUH WELL THATS LIFE BELIEVE IN YOURSELF AND DONT LET ANYONE PUT YOU DOWN HANG IN THERE MY FRIENDS YOU ARE DESTINED FOR GREATNESS -JG IN AK- (PEACE TO ALL)
1,Big Disappointment -- shoddy materials and packing,"I returned this cabinet twice due to damage sustained in shipping. The metal is so thin that it can apparently bend if the cabinet gets banged around. The thin metal and the way the sliding top is secured to the base made me think that even if it were not damaged in transit, it would probably break from normal use. That twice the cabinet broke in transit is because the manufacturer's packaging is inappropriate and the cabinet itself is so thin that normal handling apparently caused it to break twice. I saw elsewhere on the Internet that I am not the only one to have the problem. This is the best price I found by far and AMAZON was great in first exchanging it and then returning it. I will look for a better product."
1,Great singer.....Bad production,"Thomas Hampson is about 10 times better then what this DVD demonstrats. It is a cold, one man show in a very stiff setting. Thomas Hampson shows very little emotion or personality in the DVD which is indeed what the man has when he is ""let loose"" to put his soul and emotion into his beautiful voice. Skip this one unless you are into bordom. Sorry Tom."
2,"Eh, it's ok...","Okay, so I bought it because it was cheap. And I only have one rug in my four-room apartment. But honestly, I'm online searching for a ""real"" vacuum now because my bedroom rug is driving me CRAZY.Works well on wood floors. I think I'll give it to my mother, because it's light and she'll be able to handle it easily. She's jazzed about the corner nozzle design (not so exciting to me).You know what? You get what you pay for on this one..."
3,It's an okay little sucker.,"I don't love this tool because I find it awkward to use. It lacks the flexibility of my old Dirt Devil, which also had the wedge head, a feature I like.I find the hose attachment very hard to use because it's not flexible enough, and the machine itself is terribly unwieldy for hose use.The cord storage is awful, and the on/off switch couldn't be more inconvenient. Well, maybe it could...like at the very bottom of the cleaning head for instance.It's very noisy. I hate emptying it.There's just one thing I have to praise to the sky. It has suction power I was floored by (pun intended). This little sucker certainly does that. It works on the few small rugs I have in the kitchen area, well enough to hold them until I use the big serious vacuum cleaner. And on vinyl, it's terrific.I bought it for kitchen use. It does the job there well enough."
2,What a disappointment!,"I owned an older version of the Dirt Devil stick vacume and it was pretty good except that it kept falling over and finally broke. I figured that this newer version would be the same, if not better, but I was wrong. The most annoying thing about the machine is the cord holder. On the old model you could just wind the cord around hooks. On this model there's this ridiculous clip thing that your supposed to clip the cord to - but you have to wind the cord into a loop first. The next most annoying thing is that it's very awkward to use the attachments. You pop off the floor attachment and connect the hose to the bottom of the unit and then have to hold the vacume horizontally by another handle. I do, however, find that the unit is very good for quick cleaning and sucking up balls of pet hair, but it doesn't do much beyond that."
3,Bagless ??,"Seems to pick up dirt okay, but requires more passes to clean a certain area. The poorly designed filter negates the bagless feature. All except the bigger chunks of dirt stick to the filter which is hard to clean. Maybe they should redesign it with a disposable filter -- they could call the new filter a bag."
2,Makes your hair stand up,I received the product quickly and as described. The product disappointed in that it seemed to make my hair look dried out and unhealthy.
3,Particles get stuck between the 2 mesh layers...,"This is a very high quality, nicely made chinois. I often use it to strain sauces prior to reducing, for a really smooth texture. This is an ultra-fine mesh for sure, but I did not realize that it is a double-layer of mesh when I bought it. What happens is that lots of particles make it though the first layer, but not the second, so after straining stock for example, there are a bunch of pepper bits stuck in between the screens. I can't seem to get them out, and I don't want those things inadvertently flavoring the next sauce I make. So the bottom-line is that I can't effectively clean it after use. So I think I will sell this one, and go back to a single-layer ultra-fine mesh traditional sieve (Williams Sonoma has one)."
1,WORST VIDEO EVER,"This video is a waste of time. It's ..., hardly any good fights, it's really stupid and boring and you'll get a headache from watching it. It's not too wild for tv, it's a bunch of scenes from ... wrestling league's kids kickboxing to music in thailand (it's really stupid) and a bunch of crowds gathering around some people arguing and every single punch you see is rewinded and replayed like 5 times to waste time. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME ON THIS ...!!!"
2,Missing Information,No where in the title or in the description did it say that I would receive only the second volume or that there was more than one volume. I felt jipped.
1,A waste of money!,This product does not work at all. I decided to try this as a natural approach and it did nothing for me. Do not waste your money on this!!!
4,This really helps me with my anxiety issue,I am so happy I found this product. I don't believe in taking prescription drugs to address my particular issue with anxiety. I'd rather take the holistic/ all natural approach. This product I will continue to take.
3,It works to lessen the frequency & severity but is no miracle worker,"I bought this product about three months ago ... I was suffering from extreme anxiety and panic attacks. It doesn't calm me down when I take it, however I did notice that after a month of taking it my anxiety attacks where fewer and less severe. At this point three months later I'm learning to cope with the anxiety through diet and exercise. I reduced my sugar intake, cut out caffeine completely and walk three times a week. I take the Anxietol 7 as a supplement to lessen my anxiety. If your looking for a product to immediately calm sudden panic attacks or GAD this is not the product for you. Try PureCalm ... also on this site... Purecalm mixed with Tazo calm tea... soothes your nerves in 15 minutes or less."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY THIS STUFF DOES NOT WORK,This product is one of many that claims to reduce anxiety.However after using it for 2 months it has done nothing torelieve my anxiety. I wasted my money like on Seredyn whichalso doesnt work. Dont be fooled by the bogus reviews Anxietoland Seredyn post.
5,Works better than prescriptions for me for anxiety,Anxietol 7 is worth trying if you suffer from anxiety. I have taken prescrition medication for it and this works the same if not better.
1,why buy a pill when you don't know what's in it?,"I got here from a website I'd never seen before, which purported to ""review"" alternative medications. But the link to ""BUY NOW"" was in the middle of the ""editorial review"" - which happened to make this pill seem like a dream. This was my first suspicion (I've been a journalist for many years, and no self-respecting journalist would allow this merging of content with advertising).Then I arrive here and see that the ingredients are ""proprietary,"" which means I cannot research them or - in fact - ever know anything about them. I went to the company website and asked - by email - for specific info on the ingredients of this supplement and have never received an answer.So, that would be my second suspicion of this supplement and this company.Best advice: Don't put something in your mouth for which you are not told the ingredients. EVER, EVER, EVER"
4,Anxietol 7 helps me deal with stress,This product works great. I have been under an enormous ammount of stress caused by something I cannot escape.....family members- Inlaws from hell. Anxietol 7 has helped me deal with having to be around them or deal with thier issues...it's either this or burbon!
4,Very happy with this product,I think this product is very good for the nervous condition I have seem to have aquired since taking on another stressful job.It seems to be helping and this is my 2nd order so far I like the product.
4,Really helped with my anxiety and nervousness,I am happy I found this product here at amazon. It works very well for me.
3,Anxietol 7 is working for me,I'm in a much better place since taking Anxietol 7. So far this is my 2nd order I have placed. I feel less stressed since taking it. I am very happy with this product. Would rate it higher but shipping service was not a good experience. It got dropped off at my neighbors and they had it for almost a week. Fortunately I have honest people in my building.
3,Helped with my anxiety,"I have 3 small children, a dog, a sick mother an internet related job and I'm in the process of divorce.This product is saving my sanity!"
3,Anxietol 7,This product's box arrived broken. The contents inside didn't get damaged though. The seal was still intact. I considered returning it but had read many positive things about it so I opted to try it and I'm happy I did because it really helped me to not feel anxious when I have those moments. It sure beats having to see a doctor for prescriptions. The cost is well worth it to keep ordering from Amazon.
4,no more prescription drugs for me!,I am very happy I found this product. It works as well for me as the medication prescribed to me by my therapist for my anxiety. I highly recommend this for people who have anxiety.It calms your nerves without making you useless.
1,Doesn't work AT ALL,"This product has no effect at all. Total waste of money... I'm sure if you took the whole glass you wouldn't even notice. This was one of my first medications I tried for social anxiety relief, but have come to the conclusion that no over-the-counter medication against social anxiety really works at all - Go to the doctor and get medication that will help you instead of throwing money away on this."
5,This is a very good product for stress management,"I started taking Anxietol 7 to help me with my stress at work. I am not usually a stressed out sort of person however I recently got transfered to NYC and I'm from Utah, just that move itself is enough to stress anyone out. I am working as a trader and it is very high energy. Anxietol 7 is helping me cope with my new life here."
5,Works like a charm,"Its vacuum bags, they arrived promptly and work great. Perfect for dog hair and dust bunny pick up.Would buy again."
3,Vacuum odors still present,"Maybe my nose is sensitive but I can still smell dust after I vacuum when I stand next to my Featherlite. The bags are thicker than the standard ones and probably do filter more allergans, odors etc. but don't be fooled into thinking this will transform your upright into a true Hepa machine. That being said, because it is better than the regular bags, I will probably continue to buy these packs as long as the price stays reasonable."
1,not the best bags,I have found that these bags break in my vacuum. I have since changed to Arm & Hammer's brand of bags. They are much better.
5,"Worked great, got dog smell out of my carpet!","My roommate was complaining that the carpet smelled like dog (she does yoga so gets down close to the rug), so I get the fancy super-filtering vacuum bags for my Dirt Devil. They did the trick! She said that the carpet does not smell like dog any more, so that is just what I was hoping for. It also seemed to get a fair amount of other dirt and dust up, filled up 1/3 of the bag in 3 rooms. Easy to put on and start using."
5,I will never go back to a bagless vacuum again!,"I am so excited about getting a bagged vacuum. No more dirt in my face when I empty the ""bagless"" vacuum's canister. I think these bags will be much cleaner and easier than the bagless vacuums we have."
3,Okay,"not what I expected, but not bad. The taste is fine, just very cloudy in appearance. I was hoping to find a ""clear"" green tea....maybe it just isn't out there."
5,Good Book,"The book was in good shape and the story was about a 4 1/2 which you do not offer, so I am giving it 5 stars."
5,Gives men a sexy look in jeans,"These charley jeans are real low rise, and with stitching up the back of the buns, shows them off prominently, along with a snug feeling in the crotch. But the jeans sit very low, so thong underwear is called for. The material is light, so dries easily (it isn't denim). I had the khaki jeans, which look real hot, as light colors show of more of the clothed male body."
3,Out of Touch With Reality,"What a joy to read this book! It is so full of sugar-coated sentiments and feel-good euphemisms. And then finally you have to put the fantasy book down and re-enter the real world where people are standing in line at the pawn shop, selling their wedding rings just so they can get food to feed their children that day. Where truckers are selling their CB radios just so they can buy gas to make their run. The woman who wrote this book is no CEO. She is no President of anything. She is a housewife dancing through the trees: I ""fell helplessly under the spell of the redwoods by the sea..."" She's probably going to end up being a bag lady if she isn't careful. I would give more credit to a CEO or an old fox who wrote a job book than this housewife. What are her credentials? The ability to save and publish every witty thing stuck to the refrigerator?"
4,good kids watch,Nice watch and I recieved it quickly. Only comment would be the stiching on the inside of the slots you put the band through does bother my daughters wrists. Perhaps softer stiching or softer leather would improve this product. All in all excellent for the money
3,"Nice watch, but weak cover and goes late","At first, my daughter loved this watch. She wore it everywhere and by doing so she learned to tell time. However, after a couple of days, the watch was about 5 minutes late. Also, the watch cover does not appear to have any scratch resistant qualities. After about a week, the cover was very scratched, still readable, but it doesn't look like a new watch, when it still should."
3,Band too long,"My 8 year old daughter has a small wrist, so I was looking for a small bodied watch like this. It seems to be of decent quality but the band is far too long - long enough for a smaller adult to wear."
2,Scratches too easily,"I purchased this as a Christmas present for my 8-year-old. After being worn for about 2 weeks, the clear plastic is already horribly scratched and cloudy. I'm not sure exactly what is scratching against the face (perhaps it rubs her school desk when she writes?), but in my opinion a kids' watch should be made of something more durable. I regret the purchase and feel I've wasted my money."
5,Nice little watch,"Purchased for little girl just turning 6. She loved it and wears it all the time. She is just learning to tell time and we wanted to buy her a watch which would help her with this, not just a digital watch. The watch is ""tough"" and keeps up with her during all her activities and school. I would recommend this Timex for its quality and easy readability of the dial for children."
3,No leather strap!,"As a timepiece it is satisfactory, but the strap is not leather, as was indicated in the product description. (It is vinyl.)"
5,Great for a pre-teen,My daughter loves this watch. It is comfortably priced and stylish enough that pre-teens who have outgrown the 'kiddie' watches will wear it.
5,Daughter loves it and is learning how to tell time,We received this watch within the timeframe indicated. It appears as advertized and works well. My daughter loves the way it looks and she can actually read the time by the timepieces's hands. Her former watch was a Disney theme and had so much junk on the face it wasn't possible to read the watch with confidence. We've had it for a couple of months now and she still loves it. She likes the indiglo feature too. I'm glad it is somewhat water resistant. I'm hoping it will last at least a couple of years.
2,scratched in 1 week,This is a cute watch but it is horribly scratched up after just one week. It's made for kids and should be more durable than that
4,"Good Quality, Right Price",Purchased for my 8-year old daughter who is learning to tell time. This is an excellent quality watch for any age. The leather strap is of good quality. My daughter loves the blue glow backlight. Excellent product for a good price.
1,Doesn't work,When I got the watch it didn't work. I replaced the battery and it still doesn't work. It's pretty though.
3,cute but strap not too sturdy,"The watch was cute, however the band broke within 2 days. The band itself was sturdy but where the pin connects the strap to the watch itself, it is paper thin and for a child, it tore easily. I had to find a replacement strap...that did not match as well in order to fnd a child's size band. As far as the watch, being that it is a Timex I am sure we will have no problem there....the band was the issue."
1,NOT a LEATHER Strap,"The website clearly states that the strap is leather. The watch has a tag that clearly states that the strap is SYNTHETIC leather. So clearly, the website is wrong. This deserves the low rating. Amazon will not exchange this for one with a leather strap."
3,Good watch for a young girl but...,"Although this was a great first watch for my daughter, the watch band broke after only a few months of use and a replacement band was almost the same price as the watch itself!"
3,Strap is NOT Leather!!!,"After completly opening the package and extracting the watch (difficult to say the least), I saw the tag on the watch that said ""Synthetic Leather"". The Amazon product description says ""Leather Strap Watch"", but it is NOT a leather strap! The whole reason I bought this watch instead of others is that it was advertised as leather. Turns out, I should have gotten a different watch.The watch is very nice-looking, numbers easy to read, functions, and while the pink strap is pretty (and NOT leather), it is just a bit dustier than pictured.If you like the way it looks and you don't care about the leather part, it's a nice watch."
3,"broken watchband, good watch","I'm an adult and bought this watch for myself. I have rather thin wrists, so it fit perfectly. After less than a month the watchband tore right off at the point where the watchpin is located. I believe there are two other reviews mentioning the same issue. I thought it was odd because I have never had a watchband just rip like this did, so I contacted Timex and they sent a replacement band. I was pleased with their customer service. I was NOT pleased when less than a month later the same thing happened again, with the new band! Love the watch, wish the watchband was higher quality."
4,Kids watch,This is gift for my Granddaughter I'm sure she will love it.It's cute and it's pink and is perfect for as little girl.
4,VERY GOOD CUTTERS,"I have a razor that use this type of cutter,i find they give a very good shave. I purchased these cutters as a spare set to have on hand when needed. A.A.Davis Cambridge, ma."
4,African Princess,I'm the mother of a multi-racial child. I want her to know the background of all of her races. I also want her to know there are princesses of every color (unlike the Disney movies portray). This book is a wonderful glimpse into the African heritage that we all seem to know very little about.
3,Bars not included.,Shows it with bars in the picture. Don't come with bars and must be purchased seperatly. They don't state that in the description. Even worse when you go back n purchase no stainless only Al available.
3,Somewhat technical but bland,"This book is for the researcher or the sociologist. It is for a niche in studying healthcare. This book is part of a larger series of studies from the ""National Commission on Community Health Services"" from the 1960's. This was written at about the same time as Wilson's book on Community Health Structure (see my other review). This book was a process analysis. It was somewhat muttling and a difficult read for me to get into and appreciate. I think that his method of research was a bit confusing. Otherwise, I think that he had some useful conclusions about the tendencies to have ad hoc organization in terms of addressing problems and that few plans get implemented and that projects that made it to implementation did not rock the status quo. Nevertheless, I think that the of the concepts I highlighted are still relevant for the 21st century in the way communities function to address local health concerns. Read this alongside of the works by Elling, and Starr."
4,"Other than a few flaws, not bad...","I had to upgrade my video card drivers and DirectX inorder to make the game from crashing (causing a total restart of my computer).Once you get it working, the game is pretty fun, very realistic. It features 6 Olympic Events:Men's alpine skiing downhillMen's k120 ski jumpingMen's snowboard Parallell giant slalomLadies' Alpine skiing slalomWomen's Freestyle skiing aerialsMen's two-man bobsleighThe events are fun and you have 4 different playing modes... Olympic Mode (play for medals, if you play all events, you get to watch a opening/closing ceremony), tournament mode (night time tournament 4 round elimination), Classic- the conditions/difficulty gets harder round-by-round. Freeform- lets you restart events, a practice, you set time of day, weather/visibilty.The graphics are nice, i say it's worth the $$$ (...)"
3,"Bad Game, Good Music","I didn't like the game so much, but the soundtrack to it is good, except I can't find it anywhere."
2,salt lake 2002,"This game is one of the most boring games that I have ever played! Even on easy mode, u always come in last (except, usually, on downhill skiing). Anyway, once your done beating that, you look at the other five events and find that you don't want to play any of them. This game was appealing to me for the first 30 minutes that I played it. I have to write a review for it and it is almost terrible to sit down and do that. The only good thing about this game is the GREAT graphix! They are VERY nice."
4,Salt Lake City 2002,"I think salt lake city is a very good game, but i don't understand there is no speedskating in the game that's notvery good i think because speedskating is one of the greatest and most popular sports you could have by a olympic game. I'll give this game four stars because the graphics are very good and it is a good continuation on sydney 2000. The only thing that i gave a - point in that way is the speedskating. I hope that sport is in there in Torino 2006"
2,saltlakecity2002,"i would not by this game.i think it is real cheap.you alwayscome in last place.theres 6 events- mens alpine skiing downhill,mens two-man bobsleigh,ladies alpine skiing slalom,womansfreestyle skiing aerials,mens snowboard parallel giant slalom,mens ski jumping k120 individual."
1,What a disappointment,"I upgraded to Designer Pro after creating my plan in Designer 6.0. I switched mainly because the lesser version does not do roofs well. It was definitely not worth the money. Since it was 5 times more expensive, I expected 5 times more programming tools. Not so. Don't waste your cash. You will still need to hire a professional to complete your plans. Many items do not convert. The program is slower and inaccurate. Roof design is very hard to learn and very inaccurate. You will not get a set of blue prints out of it that it promises. Look elsewhere, this is not the one you want."
4,Very Satisfied,"This software was relatively easy to learn & gives us a general idea with our planning. We wanted the capability to print our blueprints, which for they money is a handy feature."
3,it has only one thing I don't like,"I don't own this software yet, but this seems to do everything that a professional design software should do except, for the unbelievable price of $400, it should be able to render photorealistic images. (pictures that look like photographs) The pictures shown are awful."
5,"Quick, versatile & Easy","I just started using the 6.0 version and I'm pleased. No, it will not replace ACAD but it is a good accessory. It's good enough for zoning and concept drawings. I hate spending days on a drawing only to have it rejected. This way I can quickly get everyone in agreement on the basic plan. The walk through can save you money & time by not having to make a bunch of revisions. It's not bad for the money and I recommend it."
1,Like gargling pigswill in an abattoir,"Although I have not had the dubious pleasure of reading this particular tome, judging by the mendacious nonsense Faurisson usually writes I would expect it to be the usual tissue of unfounded assertion, manipulation of evidence, lies and clinging onto tiny facts in the face in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary.That so many readers have chosen to award it high praise in their reviews should come as no surprise, residing as they do in a nation where 30% of people believe Elvis is alive and well, 20% of them believe in alien abduction and just as many believe in angels. I suspect most of the remaining 30% are equally credulous morons. Hey, you voted Bush in after all!How sad to see that one of my compatriots has written in praise, though as a denizen of the benighted Brum there may be an explanation there.By the way, I gave it 1 star because I was not given the opportunity to award it 0."
5,Unprecedented scholarship and research on the subject.,"Regardless of one's view of WWII or predisposition, the reader is confronted with powerful scholarship, science and corrections of history on the subject. The authors of each chapter write from dispassionate research and observation. This book is not for the faint of heart. The content is downright frightening. At the beginning, I found myself emotionally rejecting the book. At the end, I found myself challenged and filled with questions. It shook the foundations of much that I learned in American public schools about the second world war. It challenges our world views established in our early development as individuals. It violates 50 years of the ""history"" as written by the western allies of WWII. With deepest respect to the editors and authors for their courage, intellectual integrity and sacrifice."
4,Worth buying.,"The visor deluxe has a tendency to wiggle while inside the case, even if the whole thing is zipped up, but other than that it's quite satisfactory. I had it loose in a briefcase and it bounced around completely uninjured. The nylon is also good for ironing patches on."
2,Armadillo Case by Incipio,"I really like the look of this case (I had one for my palm), but the visor deluxe is a tight fit in this case. I could barely zip the case closed. It was of no use to me when that happened."
4,A pretty enticing case.,"This case is much more beguiling than the standard leather cases out there. Just look at it - doesn't it yell ""I'm not like everybody else"" (a reference to an old Kinks song). My friend calls this my ""glam"" case. It has a fairly stable plastic shell inside that wild fabric, which has a velour-like feel to it, but is surprizingly gunk-resistant (as tested by my 2-year old). The edges extend over the corners of the visor, and the zipper helps protect the outer corners to boot. I have 2 small problems with this case, thus the reason I did not give it a 5 score - (1) it is hard to get the stylus in and out of the stylus pocket, and (2) sometimes when you are zipping the case up, you have to slide the visor back up so as to get around the corner. I think the last one might be solved by making the pocket for holding the cover where you snap the visor in a little wider (if any incipio people are out there)."
3,... 2 days later...,"2 days after writing my first review, the clear compartment broke, and the giraffe fuzz was not nearly as fuzzy as it was when it was new. it looks kinda like a balding giraffe in some spots. i'm probably going to return it for a non-fuzzy one."
4,Very nice especially for the price,"I looked long and hard before purchasing this case. I wanted something small that would protect my Visor Deluxe. Most cases (the Handspring ones) left the sides somewhat unprotected in a fall and from dust. I also did not want to stick velcro on my new electronic device. This case fit the bill. It has a nice snug fit and I have not had a problem with the device turning on by itself. I can still fit this in my purse or jacket pocket. It zips (so protection for all sides and from dust). No velcro (a previous reviewer obviously did not understand how to use the cover that comes with your Visor to secure it in the pouch - very easy and secure). A nice carry strap. And one of the least expensive cases I have seen. It would be nice to have more choices of color/texture. The prints are a bit wild for me which is why I went with this model. If you are having a hard time finding a case that you like for your Visor, give this one a try."
1,Cute but shoddy.,"The best thing about this case is the cute fabric. But there's no way around it: the thing is poorly made. The inside looks like a 99-cent wallet, with its stiff plastic card window and cheap-o wallet slots. The velcro tabs are badly placed: for a secure fit, you'd have to cover part of the springboard cover on the Visor. And of course there's the zipper, which is as crummy as the rest and barely fits around a Visor. I'm returning it today."
3,Better think twice before you buy it.,"The compliation is preety good , it contains songs from the latest 3 records . But the DVD is only 20 minutes long and it's not very intresting as well , because he only talks , he barely plays anything. So don't Expect for too much , because i'm dissapointed."
3,"music good, video is terrible","as you know from reading the previous reviews, the music is a compilation of tracks from his Stretch label recordings. No problem there, unless you have these recordings already; nothing new here. My problem is the extra video disc, which are just excerpts from his instructional videos. This was really boring, and I learned absolutely nothing from this. I am a drummer, so I was hoping to learn something; I know Dave Weckl is a monster player, but this 2nd disc was terrible. Fortunately, the price was discounted so it gets 3 stars instead of 2. I sold it because I have the other recordings (and the ones he did on GRP- Master Plan is my favorite; check out the drum duet with Steve Gadd)."
2,"Discontinued by Petzl on February 4, 2012","The actual helmet gets 5 stars. It's the standard in climbing and caving. However, numerous websites report that Petzl announced it discontinued manufacture of the helmet. So if any thing needs to be replaced, such as a chin strap, foam padding or those little clips that hold the headlamp, bye-bye Ecrin Roc, hello new $120 helmet."
2,Major issues with camera,"I bought this camera with high hopes as it was recommended by Consumer Reports. I have had very mixed results. Using the camera is easy. No problems there. However, as soon as I am done with a disc the problems begin. First of all, I have had 4 out of 12 discs not finalize correctly. This causes the DVD to NOT be copyable. Basically, if my DVD ever scratches or gets lost, my video is gone forever. Big problem.I just videotaped my daughter's first birthday. Got 27 minutes into it, when the DVD gave me an error message and the disc is officially done. I can't ever get this video back.In summary, if you are willing to lose your most precious memories every so often, and don't mind not having a back up copy..this camera is great. Otherwise, you might want to shop with some other vendor."
1,Do Not Buy,"Huge Problems finalizing and using the disks, even using the recommended Maxell brand. I just spent $200 on video capture hardware, so I could get my video off the dvd-r. Manufacturer did not tell me about dvd-ram disk, as being the only way of using the dvd right out of the camera. As you probably know, the video capture hardware will convert my video into an analog signal and then back into digital, drastically reducing the video quality. I can't believe that this company would be so irresponsible with people's precious time and memories. Do not buy this camera."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CAMCORDER!,"I own this camera and recently decided to just trash the darn thing. What a huge waste of money and a huge disappointment. My first problem with the camera is that it ONLY works with Maxell disks. I realize NOW that these are ""recommended"" by the manufacturer, but this was not made clear to me when I purchased it, and it surprising how many stores don't carry the Maxell brand. For the few years since I've had this camera, we are constantly losing disks mid-use and getting error messages. Recently there was another error message and the darn thing won't even open. I can't tell you how much has been lost. And, even if you didn't have all of the hard drive problems that seem to be common to the camera, I find the DVD loading mechanism unnecessarily tricky to load. So, my recommendation is--avoid this camera. I saw a good review of it and purchased it, and it has been nothing but trouble. And from what i've read on other message boards, I am definitely not alone!"
1,Simply Awful,"This is not the Shari Lewis series from the Nineties despite the misleading packaging -- it is ""Shari"", a dreary puppet sitcom she produced in Chicago (on a very thin shoestring) from 1975-77. It is a creepy parody of The Mary Tyler Moore Show with Shari as a single mother working at a TV station run by animals. The color is drab and the video quality is horrendous (with serious dropout on several episodes). The woman is a tour-de-force even in these threadbare surroundings, providing voices for all the characters and singing one song per show, but this series will depress older children and bore younger ones to tears (as my own kids will attest). Madacy might have done better to market this one honestly as the curious relic of Seventies camp it is rather than trying to palm it off through deceptive packaging as Miss Lewis's later work."
1,poor production quality,"I was appalled by the production quality of this video. Parts of the debate are inaudible, and the camera work is deplorable. This is not an item that should be for sale to the public."
4,Grammy answers,Finally a book with the Grammy winners from the past years! I had wanted a book like this for ions. It is fun to read all the scoop and winners.
2,not very functional,"I was disappointed with this product because the opening is too narrow for any but the thinnest slices of bread. Forget about bagels... there's no way these things will fit over one. The wood is very inflexible as well, so they can't be forced open wider. I can barely use them - diet bread and frozen waffles are about the thickest things they'll extract - and those don't usually get stuck in my toaster anyhow. The quality is good but the design is bad."
3,Kinda...,"I bought these and the Harold Import Bamboo Toast Tongs at the same time to compare them.These work okay... but they do have to be held kind of carefully and are a bit frustrating and awkward.Really I bought these for my kids to do manipulative play with, but tested them on the toaster. Sometimes I find them helpful in getting toast out and other times, as I said, just frustrating.The Harold Import Tongs however, are much easier to use, for me and my two year old. They are also cheaper and you get two.These do have a magnet on them, which is nice for keeping them with the toaster, but my husband always forgets to put them back on and they get knocked off as we don't store the toaster on the counter. If it were really important to me, I'd probably glue a mangnet on the other tongs and use them instead."
3,"It is a nice tool, except the tongs will not fit over toast to be pulled out",I wish that I had known about the tongs not spreading apart with pressing on the tongs. They can't be pull apart to separate so that you can easily pull hot toast out of the toaster. So I am still looking for a useable tong.
1,Burned Fingers,"Too short. Too hard to squeeze. DON'T BUY! Waste of money.I tried to limber it up to make it easier to squeeze and it broke like an old fashioned clothes pin.Then, i threw it out in discust"
3,Excellent books but recording is abridged.,"All the positive reviews of these three Vampire Chronicles state the absolute truth about the books. AND about the unabridged recording of the Interview with the Vampire book that is NOT included in this set.What people fail to mention about this set is that each book is reduced to only 2 hours of reading time each. The original Interview book was recorded on 13 CDs (that means Interview was recorded on 13 CDs for approximately 15 hours of unabridged story, versus 2 hours on these cassettes.)How can you possibly do justice to these books in 1/8th of the time? That is only 1/8th of an incredibly rich story.Just say no to this and read the book for yourself."
1,Vampire Chronicles,Terrible! Book had a very bad smell. I returned it and have not receive my money back yet.
5,The First Three are always the best!,"Allthough Anne Has somewhat lost her ability to write a good book. The first three of the ""Vampire Chronicles"" in one book is always a good deal!The Vampire Lestat and The Queen of the Damned is by far her best work!This is such a tresure to have and to start out with. When you start reading Anne's work."
2,jw,This was a christmas present for someone which I had recieved a used appearing book with the binding broken in when I had paid for a new one. The problem was addressed with a refund promptly.
1,DISAPPOINTED,My Fault ------- I was hoping for something more along the line of a Twilight Vampire. NOT!!!!Didn't even finish the whole book - gross.
1,Vampire Chronicles,I am amazed at the amount of good reviews this book received. I have read alot of books and this one is by far the worst. Why must every situation be examined over and over again from every angle possible. I found myself saying alright already on with the next thought. This is the first time I actually didn't finish a book. I will read something else and then try to go back to it but after a page I am sick of it all over again. I won't even read another of Anne Rice's books because this one was a waste of money.
5,The Vampire Chronicles - Buy it!,Awesome book. This is among the best vampire stories ever written. If you're into vampires this is a must read.Leatherbound is very classy.
5,Wonderful,Correct verbiage of description and image. Everything that I needed and happy with product. Will continue to buy from this consumer again.
3,Well written books but Vampires are not my thing.,"Many of my family members love vampire stories and for a while it held my attention but the creepy story line is exhausting. Didn't finish the series but loved ""The Vampire Lestat"" more than ""Interview with a Vampire."" Ann Rice is a good writer the descriptions are great if you are into this type of story."
5,Fiction Bliss,"I have read this book cover to cover, this 3 book compilation of the start of the Vampire chronicle series. The leather-binding is fantastic, with imprinted textured lettering. The pages are premium quality paper that is soft and durable. The edges are golden edge sealed not only protecting the paper, but giving the book's 'thickness' the look of gold.Not to mention the VALUE of getting 3 books in 1, which saves Space, Money (shipping+ 3 separate books), and mankes the reading experience convenient in a sense of now you can keep reading right on to the next novel.NO Batteries, No apps, No charging. No eyestrain from the electronic reader. A Must have for Rice readers / Vampire enthusiasts."
4,MY oppinion about the book,"The books were very good.I have read the Interview with the Vampire,and the Lestat the Vampire.The history-what you wrote-was very intresting.I belive in Vampires-because of your books and the film.I want to be a Vampire.I have read the Dracula by Bram Stoker butthat wasn 't intresting as your book.Have a good luck,in your life.Good bye:Sánta Szilvia,from Szentes,Hungary.."
5,IWV was one of the greatest books ever written,"The Vampire Chronicles is one of the best set of books written! Anne Rice takes you into the world of the undead and it leaves you completly speechless. The characters in the book become real and very unforgetable! It leaves you spellbond and very much at the edge of your set. You can't wait to start the next book. I really loved it. 'Memnoch the Devil,' was one of the best also. I truely hope that there will be more books to this set. The entire set is a must to read and own."
4,Vampire Chronicles 1-3,"I would have preferred to have been able to buy these audio books on cd; however, they were unavailable. Since I had read them all so long ago, it was time to delve back into them. Buying audio books to bring on vacation, was the perfect idea! (I didn't have to worry about getting any suntan lotion on the pages!)"
5,A book to be read,"One of the best books I ever read, taking you into a completly different world but in familiar cities which we all know. Rice gives us the vampire's point of view and not that of the victim, they are not evil it's in their nature to kill. I was really moved by the books and couldn't put them down once I had started, I wondered what could be left to write about them but I was wrong as Rice certainly hasn't run out of ideas. If you haven't read it, read it NOW!!!!"
4,movie and novel,"I like it because I'm fond of reading vampire or mysterious stories. Watch the movie and read the book, you'll find Antonio too ugly to be Armand and know alot more details"
5,Great,I have always loved Anne Rice . The Vampire Chronicles are my favorite and now I can read them over and over no matter where I go and do not have to worry about losing them and having to buy them again
5,LOVELY WRITING,"I had avoided reading this book for years, but found the interest to do so still existed. When I began, Ms. Rice had captured me. The writing is lovely--it was so well done that I could see through my mind's eye the story unfold.It is a must read!"
1,A Wretched Non-Epic,"""Druids"" is a very important film for those filmmaking types looking to break into the historical epic genre. In fact, it should be studied in any film school - a second-by-second presentation on how NOT to make a film. Everything about this movie is bad - and this comes from somebody who delights in bad movies. Steer clear."
2,Really Boring and just not what I expected.,".... But this movie was honestly a great disappointment. The acting was awful, the plot had little to do at all with Druids. One good thing that came from me getting this awful ""b"" movie, was that I was forced to get two really good books on Druids. Skip this movie, they compare it o Braveheart on the slipcase, but do not fall for that."
2,Incredibly amateurish and embarrasingly awful.,"With the exception of a few scenes of very strong imagery and brief battle sequences with interesting music it was really, really bad. I should have known when I saw guys wearing horned helments on the back of the video box that something was up...I can't express how horrible the majority of this movie is, the acting and the silly camera angles is just incredibly bad. Plus the dialogue is so out of step with what you would expect and most of the actors DO NOT look the part in any way. I feel sorry for Mr Lambert. If they didn't have the partial nudity scenes it could have been rated PG. There is no foul language in the film at all which was refreshing. I would say if you are about 12 you would find this to be an epic, but for the rest of us Braveheart is the de facto midevil epic."
1,Who did the hairstyles for these bad actors?,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen? The actors mostly seem like extras that have had no previous acting experience. The script seems like it was written by a high schooler. The direction is awful too.And.. who is the hairstylist for these actors? Talk about bad hair. The lead character played by Chistopher Lambert looks like Dana Carvey straight out of Wayne's World. Every actor in this movie has a very, very distracting hairstyle. I didn't know they had hair mousse in Julius Caesar's time.It's hard to make it through this movie. It has a made for tv feel throughout and it just one poor attempt at movie making. Do NOT buy this movie before renting it first. You will most likely be very sorry for doing so."
1,A wretched excuse for a film,"Now, granted, you can't expect much from a Christopher Lambert straight-to-video release, but I must admit that I do enjoy bad movies from time to time, and I even derived some pleasure from Lambert's Beowulf. However, despite this, Druids is utter filth. Even Lambert doesn't seem to want to be in this one - and that speaks volumes. However, if you down a few alcoholic beverages and want to bash something Mystery Science Theater style, this might be worth a look. I mean, after all, you do get to see a bunch of fat, bearded men running around in their quilted pajamas pretending like they're REALLY in Braveheart 2. All the same, this makes Beowulf seem Oscar-worthy with its incoherent plotline and dirt poor acting."
3,"Not bad, but not great","I rented this movie (dvd version) despite all my friends saying it wasn't worth the bother. I won't say I didn't enjoy the movie, because I did. But anyone expecting an epic performance will be disappointed. Though mildly interesting and worth the...the rental, I've no care to own it. ...it annoyed me that all the druis in the film wore white (usually only the priests wore white, bards and ovates wore blue and green traditionally) and I recall maybe one person there who may have been a priest, the rest were mostly ovates.I'll admit I'm not familiar with gaulic history relating to julius caesar so I can't and won't comment on historical accuracy there. I do think that the movie was poorly titled as there is little truly regarding druids and druidic history in the film. All in all, if you want to be entertained while folding laundry, it's a decent film to watch."
4,"Interesting, not exactally like Julius told the story....","This is a fun work of historical fiction. The performances do not suffer from translation, and the ideas and concepts are historically supported by the histories. The story moves well, and ends at a good point.The title is less than accurate, but not horrible. The Roman military uniforms are 100+ years out of date, coming not from 60 BC but from AD 50+. Why can't they find an actor who looks like Julius Caesar? The movie is a fun addition to your library, and not any worse than the latest version of Cleoparta when it comes to actually researching period costuming. The Gallic costuming was very good."
2,Typical Lambert,"The only actor I knew in this movie was Lambert. I have never been a fan of his but figured give it a shot as a rental. Well it is a typical Lambert movie only worse. At least in Highlander the script and other actors around Lambert were good. In this movie (which has very little to do with Druids) the script was bad, and the other actors were bad. No one there to save Lambert from his dreadful lisp (get the cotton out of your mouth, even Barbara Walters learned how to get over a speech impediment). Of course there were some historical highlights that a previous review posted, as well as a few anomlies. But the one incorrect thing they put into the movie was the made the leader of the Tuetons a head hunter. It was the Celts who were ""Head-Hunters"", after a battle the Celts would collect the heads of important enemies."
2,Fair movie with some serious flaws,"Although it has it's share of interesting battle scenes, overall it is rather dull. The absolute worst thing about this movie is the sound editing for English. It's like they include none of the original sound, and tried to dub in everything. Everything sounds fake."
1,YAWN!,"Once agian Chris Lambert proves his acting is less then spectacular! The acting and dialog were so woooden and dry, that it makes Plan 9 From outer Space look like hamlet! STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS!"
1,"Great potential, but never lives up.","When I first purchased this movie, I thought it had the potential of being like Braveheart. Unfortunately, the cast was weak, the music was inappropriate (ethereal new age tunes), the battles were boring, and the filming was poor (slow motion camera tricks for no reason at all). Save your money and move onto another film, or if you're interested in still buying the movie, look for my copy in the Used section."
2,Very disappointing,"The only good thing I can say about this debacle is that is not as bad as ""A Knight's Tale"". Complete disregard for history, not to mention poorly written and horrible editing. However, the worst thing about this travesty is Christopher Lambert's wig during the beginning scene when they deserately try to convince us that he is a teenager. Definately don't buy this movie! If you are a fan of any of the actors you will be disappointed in their performance and if you are looking for a good historical drama you will be mislead. Only watch this as a freebie!"
3,"only good for your collection, no more","When , I bougth this movie , I have the expectation to see a great film, but o deception, The story is good, but the role of Christopher Lambert is not believable , Max Von Sidow appears just a little and don't approach his talent, I dónt like the quality of the fotograph, reviewing the picture will be ok in your collection furniture"
1,Don't waste your money,"This movie is about the Guals fighting with the Romans. It is choppy and random and the scene shifts do not seem to make much sense. The movie transitions from loud screaming to whispering alot so you can not just leave the volume at one level. The story could have been interesting had it been told better.The acting left a lot to be desired. Except for the ""arch-druid,"" non of the people in leadership roles realy gave off an air of authority.This is a story of a man who was destined to keep Gaul from the Romans only he fails. So technically he was not even destined. This movie tries really hard to be BraveHeart but comes up way short. If you realy have nothing better to do with a couple of hours, and trust me you have something better to do, watch this movie."
1,HORRIBLE!,"I wish that I could have given this movie no stars. I have always watched an entire movie because I feel that there is always a chance the movie could get better before it ends. Well, the movie never got better. Horrible acting, horrible war scenes, did I mention horrible acting. Basically this movie was HORRIBLE!!!Do not waste your time on this movie. I recommend catching up on your sleep, doing some math problems or staring at a wall. All these activities would be more exciting than watching this film."
2,WIMPHEART,"DRUIDS is one of the movies that tries to achieve the lofty status of such movies as BRAVEHEART or GLADIATOR, and fails miserably. Padded with endless scenes of marching soldiers, horses, etc., the movie lacks any true epic proportions. Christopher Lambert is an awful choice for such a fierce and charismatic leader; and the hairdos are preposterous. Then we get German actor Klaus Maria Brandauer with his heavy accent and his attempt to mimic the hairdo of Marlon Brando in the role of a flaccid and boring Julius Caesar. Not being a true historic buff, I can't attest to the accuracy of the story, but I'm sure it should have been more exciting. Some of the battle scenes have some power, but overall DRUIDS joins a list of other Lambert movies to avoid including THE TARGET. The music is also anachronistic and unsuited for this film."
4,"Though not a masterpiece, a movie worth watching!","Druids, brings to the screen the story of the Gaul chieftain Vercingetorix, as he seeks to protect his country and his people against Julius Caesar and the Roman legions.The major setback is in relation to the acting (or lack of it); apart from Christopher Lambert who is his usual Highlander self, the rest of the cast are badly in need of acting lessons! Another weakness is in relation to the very poor dialogues.Aside from that, the setting, the plot, and the costumes are pretty good!The film combines drama, action, and adventure making it rather enjoyable, as long as you're in that kind of a mood.In short, it is a movie worth watching, especially for those with a soft spot for History and all things Roman, though you might not want to go as far as purchasing it."
3,Not so hot,"I ordered this because I'm into things Celtic and Christopher Lambert. I didn't realize that Vercingetorix is just the French version of Druids. The history wasn't too off the mark but the acting and actor's attire was kinda hokey. The biggest disappointment was no English subtitles and my French is a bit rusty. So I just bought Druids and watched them back to back. It's a shame that this was obviously such a low budget film, because Vercingetorix had a powerful influence on the future of the Celts. Maybe a remake could be done..."
1,dissapointment,"This movie was a dissapointment to say the least. From watching the jazzed up previews, one would compare this movie to Braveheart, but from the first scene, the reality of this movie's abusurdity sets in. I actually thought after viewing the first scene, that this movie was made for children. But, after watching a few more, I realized that it is just bad. First, there was the editing. The scenes are either too short or too long. And it looks as if the movie has been dubbed! Second, the acting. I didn't expect much from Christopher Lambert.. but from the rest of the normally wonderful actors, I was sadly dissapointed and shocked.This movie is based on a book, and the book is actually quite good...but this just makes a mockery of it."
1,Waste of money and time to watch this stupid movie,"Poor acting, poor soundtrack, nothing positive to mention about this movie.The worse war movie i've ever watch, don't even think of adding this to your collection, you will regret! Not even worth a star..."
1,Booty galore!,"This is perhaps one of the most dreadful movies ever made, so bad that it is unintentionally hilarious. Which is how I got the idea for this new parlor game...Invite all your friends over and put this movie on. Everytime someone in the film says the word ""booty"" everyone has to take a drink. The first one to pass out wins and doesn't have to watch the rest of the film."
4,A VAMPIRE ROMANCE,"This was my first vampire book by Amanda Ashley and i must say it was a catcher. The romance was wonderful, Gregori really knows how to make a woman feel exrta special. It wasn't just a vampire story but it had time travel, action, and ofcourse love. Enjoyed reading it."
2,I beg to disagree,"I just read this book a few weeks ago and the fact that I can barely remember the characters is telling. I realy have to disagree with those readers who found t his book, enthralling, great ... Reading it was actually a chore. If a book interests me, I tend to try to read it in ne sitting. It took me ages to finish this book and in between I read a Linda Howard and a John Grisham. If you want a really enthralling vampire read, try one of Linda Lael Miller's Vampire series or, better still, Jasmine Cresswell's Prince of the Night. The latter is probably one of the most original vampire and enthralling romances."
4,A thriling book to put you on the edge of your seat!!!,"I have read some vampire romance books in the past, but this one I truly enjoyed. As far as I am concerned for ANGELA HANLEY, I would never think of comparing this book to a low budget film! And anyways I have seen some vary good low budget films, with characters played extremly well, and with a good plot. Yes, it did drag on in some parts but you never knew what was to happen next. The characters could have been described more in detail, but that was okay. The ending was kind of disapointing, but it didn't necessarily ruined the book, because the ending could have been a lot worse. So, read the book if you haven't yet. Anyone, feel free to e:mail me at any time with your ideas and coments. And I will be sure to get back with you."
1,laughable,"I read one other book of Ashley's and hated it but I thought I would give her another shot. The characters in this novel lack depth and the ""goody two shoes"" heroine is laughable.I won't waste my time on others from her. They just aren't well thought out and seemed cranked out with a ""write a novel in a week"" format."
1,Didn't like it.,"This had to be the worst vampire romance i ever read, but then again i am use to Christine Feehan and Linda Lael Miller or ""Dark"" series, Sherrilyn Kenyon's ""Dark Hunter books, so maybe im wrong it just wasn't a book i sat down and got interested in i found myself skipping pages and when you got to do that it's not really worth reading there was way to many fillers in it, i wont go into all the things i did not like or i would have to tell the whole story."
1,Didn't like it.,"I've read all of Amanda Ashley's books and of all of them I thought this was the worst. I didn't like it for a number of reasons, one: because it took place in the 90's, two: after a while the books get a bit repetitive, three: I didn't like how the vampire hunter just hung around and I didn't like the story line. All together it just made one horrific book. Of all of her books, I still like ""A Darker Dream"" the best."
5,Historical perspective,This is a well researched book providing a historical foundation to the modern day conflict in the Middle East and it's spread throughout the world.
1,JUST SAY NO!!!,omg i got this 2 pack from some cheap bin and no wonder it sucks so bad -its not even a good/bad movie! and i watch a lot of old good/bad movies! seriously dont buy this people you will hate it its not even something to watch and make fun of its just that bad.and it doesnt even deserve 1 star.
1,not worth it,"This product may smell like urine, but it did nothing to help my dog pee on/around it. It ended up being a bright yellow stake in my backyard for nothing. It's not worth the money."
1,This Does Not Work,This is a waste of time and money and doesn't work at all. My dog sniffed it and then walked away and peed somewhere else. Don't waste your time with this product.
1,what a joke,"what a joke, this thing just does not work. my borador thinks it is toy , keeps going into the yard and brings it back. save your money it doesn't work"
1,no good,"I didn't read reviews, just purchased in store. Puppy would check it out but NEVER used it for potty. Even used spray on it. No use! Surprised because I had great respect for simple solution. Maybe they should read these reviews and pull this product."
1,DOES NOT WORK,I did everything to try to get this awful0smelling thing to work and my dogs wanted nothing to do with it. Waste of money.
1,Does not work,"I just moved into a new house and put one of these in the back yard before I let any of my dogs out there. They have now hosed down most of the backyard, but there's one area not a single dog has not peed anywhere near, and that's the area around this post."
1,doesnt work,my golden retreiver puppy couldnt care less about this dumb thing. even followed all directions and it does not work
2,Mine was stolen out of the yard,"Our dog had no problem going next to, and even occasionally on, the pee post. The problem we had is that within three days of us staking it into the ground some animal dug it up and took off with it. It wasn't our own dog, as we have him on leash outside (still a puppy). We live up in the mountains, so maybe bobcats like the pheromones?"
1,Didn't work !,I read the instructions !Put the poll - try to make the dog pee around the POLLNothing !Didn't work !Not good for me !
1,Didn't work,My dog did not pay any attention to this product inspite of the claims. It is just a plastic yellow spike.
1,"Worthless, doesn't work","Tried this for a 5 year old potty trained dog, AND for a 6 month old puppy... DID NOT WORK FOR EITHER. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY WITH THIS..."
1,Didn't work for us,We tried this for our 2 dogs out of last resort measures and it was worthless. Both dogs (Schnoodle and Jack Russell Terrier) have completely ignored it for months.
1,save your money,My two dogs showed absolutely no interest in the pee post. I think I would have gotten better results if I left a ten dollar bill out there for them to pee on!
1,Good Human Idea,"The Simple Solution Pee Post is a good idea from a human perspective. I inserted the post in a part of the yard that I wanted to be used as 'the' area and they didn't even sniff it as something new, let alone as an attractant. The package lists about 'pee here' technology and descriptions list is a training device that ""teaches your pet to urinate in a specific area of your yard"". NOT TRUE. You can teach your dog to use it but you have to do just that...take the dog to the post until it goes, everytime you want it to go there, until it understands it is on the 'marking' route. My dogs have this as one of many places in the yard that they use. So it didn't work here and was a waste of my money."
2,Didn't work,My dog showed no interest in this pee post despite following all the suggestions on the package. I wish I could get my money back!
1,doesn't work!,i bought this for my dog so i wouldn't have to go search the entire backyard when it is clean up time......yea my dog doesn't even know it's there.....total waste......and it smells really bad
1,Save your money,My dogs had absolutly no interest in even looking at the pee post. These are dogs that like to mark everything. I took them over to see it and they just walked away with-out a backward glance. Sounded like a good idea but too bad it doesn't work.
1,Only worked in store,"I thought this was going to work great because my yorkie actually peed on it in the packaging when it was on a lower endcap at Petsmart. Then I bought one, and had it in the yard for a few months. He went everywhere in the yard except where the post was. I figure it's too late to return now, so I just threw it away, but I can not recommend it to anyone else. I would give it zero stars if Amazon would let me."
1,A waste of money...,I totally agreed with all of you who bought this item....It smells so bad and my puppy didnt even notice the pole in the backyard...A waste of money...people dont buy it! and all of us should contact the product factory to stop making them...they dont work!!
1,Junk!,"I bought this in hopes my dogs would pee on it instead of everything else in the yard (mainly our air conditioner unit). They sniffed it and walked away, they didnt care about it, never peed on it, nothing. My male dog pees everywhere my female dog pees and this didnt help get him to pee in one spot at all. I even stuck it by the tree he loves to pee on and nothing."
1,pee post,"I really wanted this to work, but I took it out of the package and put it in the ground. My dog dug it up and ran with it, acting as if it was a chew toy. Oh well.."
1,Doesn't work at all,"I do dog rescue of small dogs. I always have about 8 in/out of the house. Not a single dog went to the post the first day or two. After that, some sniffed at it, but none peed on it. Dud !!"
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this (not from Amazon, but just want to post a review to help)hoping to help out my 7-month old adopted lab puppy (who was kept outside and never housebroken at her last home) to pee outside. She was doing well without the post, but still has some accidents, so I wanted reinforcement to go outside. Well, because I guess it smells like another dog, and she is totally a non-alpha dog and actually shy about intruding on other dogs' territory, it actually made her training go BACKWARDS. Now she is terrified to go in her ""spot"", and would rather go inside. I hate this thing and am sending it back; I wouold give it 0 stars but they make me give at least 1. Maybe it would work with a more alpha dog, but beware if your dog is not."
1,Pee Post - not a hit,"I ordered the Pee Post with limited expectations, and was still disappointed. My dog has not even sniffed the post, much less peed on it even with great encouragement. My comment is that since the area around the Pee Post is now green since he won't pee in the area of the post, maybe the product could be used for the opposite as advertised?"
1,Didn't work for me,I could smell whatever they put on it and that made it promising to me that it was going to work. However I experienced the same exact thing as the other posts on here...Dog went to look at it and kept on going. I took him to it and did what the package said but it didn't work.
2,Pee Post,"I bought the pee post because I wanted my Golden Retriever to go pee in another part of our yard. Well, she was attracted to the pee post, but she ate it."
4,Cheap Book not a letdown to me.,I don't know why this book is so cheap compared to other bios of stars. I loved this book. I actually have three copies. Call me obsessive. I love Roseanne what can I say? If you love Roseanne buy it. ~umpymama
4,Love that opinionated woman,"This book is more opinion that autobiography, as you would expect from the queen of opinion. I laughed my way through this as Roseanne displayed her usual sense of humor and wit. Anyone who goes into reading this book not knowing much about the woman herself will no doubt find this to be an eye-opening experience. This was a fun way to spend a couple of hours and after reading it, I understand why this woman got as far as she did in the entertainment industry. She truly has a let no one keep me down attitude."
4,American woman,"Roseanne's first autobiography included the story of how she became national celebrity and standup comic. There were many pictures of Roseanne both older and newer included, as well. At the time of this book's publication there were many rumors and stories written about Roseanne which this book also does a good job in dispelling. Roseanne's writing can be described as almost crazed because she moves around in all different directions without having a central theme to it. Nevertheless I enjoyed the book because it was not just informative and interesting but also very funny in parts."
1,Isreal Symphomy Ochrester,Trash...trash...trash..the worst recording he has ever done..It would have been better if he recorded it with the Uganda Symphony Orchester. I wasted my money on this piecs of junk. And if possoble I'd like you to send this review directly to him.
3,Bought this for my brother,"I bought this for my brother, the quality and speed of the product was awesome, however, I can't tell if the book was well written easy to understand and stuff like that :-S"
4,Good for more advanced level,You need to have a good understanding of Biochemistry to follow along with this book. It does not provide a lot of basic information.

1,"Bad, bad, bad","I used this printer twice and kept getting ""paper jam"" although there was no paper in the printer. Had to send the product back. Wouldn't buy another."
4,From a technical point of view...,"This book looks at how the Wright Brothers achieved flight through a detailed technical analysis of their work, including many mathematical formulaes and tables. It thus requires a certain level of knowledge to be read. A must have for those interested in the engineering aspects of flight, but only for those!"
3,Entertaining Concept - Brat Heroine,"I was fascinated with the potential for this story - a story that interweaves a present-day heroine into a mystery from the past, this is normally my favorite kind of story. So I delved into Lady Caroline with high hopes. Those came crashing down when I encountered the ""spoiled rich girl"" heroine who thinks she can ""tantrum"" her way into buying an old English estate which used to belong to Lady Caroline - Lord Byron's lover. The diaries, which are fictional accounts of entries written by Lady Caroline and Lord Byron are fascinating and seem so real. But the present-day heroine, as I said, is so immature that she spoils the story for me. I also didn't find the villainous lawyer credible. The hero is sexy - and the story of Lady Caroline/Byron the real pull that kept me turning the pages. If you can get past the present day characters - then the story is entertaining, but if you can't, then you may find the story disappointing, as I did."
