2,OH DEAR!!!,"Oh Dear!! When a reveiw starts with Oh Dear then you just know the movie went bad. I waited and hoped this film would be released, I'd heard so much about it. This was one of the most horrific movies banned under the video nasty craze. I think it was banned because it was plain rubbish. DO NOT BUY, Its pretty bad but if your like me your gonna buy it anyway. Get some beer and watch it if you have to."
1,Heavily Edited!,"This is a heavily edited version of Antropophagous made by Joe D'Amato,and its have no menu,and horrible sound.The Movie very good itself,but keep looking for Antropophagous titled UNCUT version.Available at Xploitedcinema.com"
2,Creepy atmosphere but not much else.,"Having just seen Anthropophagus: The Grim Reaper on DVD for the first time, I was hoping for a lot more gore. But I didn't get it. I have no idea why this movie was banned so much. It's not that gory. Even uncut, it isn't that sick or terrifying. Just a little creepy. In fact, the gore scenes that are here are really not that great. Even the one where the ripper rips a fetus from a woman's womb and eats it isn't really all that disturbing. The fetus was just a dead rabbit the producers bought at a butcher's shop. This film had a real bad reputation when it debuted, but, watching it today, I really don't know why. It's no big deal. George Eastman, the guy who played the weird cannibal, moves about like a really slow zombie. Except for his complexion, he's hardly a threat. Or at least, he shouldn't be. The people in the film he catches and kills must be really stupid if they let a slowpoke like him get to them."
4,Knows what he's talking about,"This is...as others have stated... out of date, but still a good book. Those who want to know how to do html from scratch could still find useful information in here.Good book."
5,Happy,"very happy with my the movie i ordered. it was used but in like new condition, played perfectly my son enjoyed it"
2,"Enh, it's OK","Watered down folk-psych circa 1968. If you think Country Joe and The Fish is too hard rock then this is for you. Too too flower power and not very imaginative, in fact it's rather boring. Perhaps it should be retitled Exile On Yawn Street."
2,Better than Volume 2,"But not as good as Volume 1. Experimental indeed, 1:32 of pure silence on WWIII...it was the 60's man. Annoying chatter from Markely not as annoying on this one, either becuase its less in the mix, less songs have it or sometimes it actually works. Take with a big grain of salt (or a big grain of something) and you might be allright. Better as a concise ablum than earlier disjointed efforts but not as many great songs (but less sucky ones at least)."
4,Happy with my choice,"After getting these IM-390 earphones, I tried them against my buddy's higher price range Etymotic ER6i and similar priced Sony MDR EX71 earphones just to make sure I made the right choice. I'm pretty happy with my choice. Compared to the Sonys, the IM-390s are much cleaner with fuller base. Against the Etymontics, the sound comes out about equal. The Etymotics had slightly nicer base, but I still found the IM-390s sound cleaner. The Etymotics also have multi-prong foam eartips the kinda felt like they were invading your brain thru your eardrums. The IM-390s are comfortable over several hours of wearage."
2,Sounds good.,"For the price it sounds good and thats it. I bought it it looked worse than in the picture. And it didnt even last 2 months. I called Maximo and thank God they were nice, they told me to just cut them in pieces and send the photo .. I received my replacement in a week. But it broke again in 2 moths exact. I just give up the hussle to call Maximo again if its going to break again in 2 moths...."
5,Great Quality All Around,"I am quite picky when it comes to sound. I can't stand the standard Apple headphones. I used to prefer only the Sony Fontopia headphones that were priced about the same as these. These headphones ended up being much better sounding than anything else I have ever owned and they have lasted a long time. Built rock solid, my kids have played with them and they haven't broken or shorted out. Great product for the price! I will buy Maximo in the future."
2,"Adapters, Extension Cable, Carrying Case","It is hard to quantify the value of sound quality. I used Shure E2c-n for more than a year, and Etymotic ER-4S for several years. The latter are about as good at sound reproduction as anything I have ever heard (eg Sennheiser HD650), and to me the E2c-n are at least in the ballpark. If I figure 200USD for close to perfect sound, 75USD for something almost as good, what should I expect for 25USD? Something that sounds better than a mobile phone? Better than the speakers in a laptop computer? If so, I think the Maximo iM-390 are not even close to worth it. The reason I give them 2 stars instead of 1 is they come with decent adapters, extension cable and carrying case. For somebody who spends 200USD or more fpr a music player and the music on it, I think it is probably worth paying the extra 50USD to get something like the E2c-n.Shure E2c-n Sound Isolating Earphones (Black)"
3,Sounded good through one ear,The sound was great but it only came through one ear. Amazon's return process rocks and they made it right! I reordered and will order again and again from Amazon!!!
5,It an Ear Full With Maxim Im-390,"With many Earphones it is the sound that matters. This one ring thru very well. I prefer an in the ear soft piece. Then one the hang just inside your ear and never stays in are a total waste and never fit. I had to go to Radio Stack to get caps with rubber ear piece to be able to use those. The only problem with these type of ear plugs from Maximo is that the wire would break loose inside the earphone, if you keep yanking on the wire when taking them off. Every kids does this as cool. My daughter gone thru fours sets of plugs because of this. You think a company would not considered that. Kids are rough on wires. But they worth the money. Treat it with care and take them off at the ear. It give your years of good use."
1,misleading,I returned this item.the ad says it is a 2.5mm head phone.it is not.it has a bulky adapter that hooks on that make them akward to use.I did plug them into my other phone and they do have a good sound.
4,Good deal,"I received this item in less than a week from ordering. So far, very pleased with the headphones and their service !!!"
4,Better than most headphones for bass,"I had these headphones a while back....the bass is really worth the buy if you don't want a wrap-around headphone...., good product. The earplugs are size changable.. (the bass does kick)...which is pretty sweet....I think I used my headphones too much & probably didn't take the best care of them which is why eventually one of the earplugs came apart. I'd get it again if I had the money(just got an itouch) cheers."
2,Not great,I originally rated these a higher but after a few months using them I find myself going back to my old Sony fontopias which are like 3 years old - sound better and are more comfortable. I really don't care for how these fit (don't fit.) They sound crinkly and tinny. I wouldn't buy them again.
1,Great Machine- ** NO Support ** Its the service after the sale that counts.,"I confess, I like Starbucks. I like to have my cappuccino made for me. I also like to make my own on occaision.This machine worked well for a while and then it seemed to be clogged after a couple of months of not being used. There were two available options for service. One company in my whole state who was 2 hours away and the manufacturers rep in NY. I chose NY. I didn't get it out until after the year was up, although I had gotten a number at 10-11 months.They charged me $70 to fix the machine, claiming that --I-- did something to one of the hoses.Gaggia Esspresso is a great machine, but don't expect service if something goes wrong. I laid out over $200 for the machine which I rarely used. Then another $70-$80 bucks to get it fixed when it should have been covered by warranty.Next time I'll buy another brand. I won't reccommend any other one, because I don't want you to think I work for a different brand. I don't"
3,GET COUGHT IN THE TRAP THE TENDER TRAP,"THIS IS A GREAT FILM FOR SINATRA FANS AND REYNOLDS FANS ALIKE. THEY SEEM SO WORK SO WELL TOGEATHER, IN THE FILM REYNOLDS PLAYS A CHICK WHO IS VARY REFIND BUT YET KINKY IN HER OWN WAY AND SINATRA PLAYS THE HIP YOUNG PLAY BOY TYPE WITH SOME GOOD JOKES TO BACK IT ALL UP. THERE IS ALSO A GREAT SONG IN THE FILM BY TWO OF MY FAVORITE COMPOSSERS SAMMY CAHN AND JIMMY VAN HEUSEN WHO WROTE SONGS FOR MANY OF SINATRA'S FIMS. I REALLY LIKE THIS FILM AND IM SURE YOUR GONNA LIKE IT TOO!"
2,Aggressive Defense of Marriage,"The Tender Trap is one of the most aggressive defenses of marriage ever seen in the movies. Carefree Frank Sinatra is bullied by depressed married friend David Wayne into leaving his happy bachelor life for the supposed solidity of married life. Frank is eventually roped by control-freak Debbie (""I don't care who I marry as long as I'm married by 22"") Reynolds into a presumably happily ever after married future. A depressing movie that is barely redeemed by sympathetic performances by Sinatra and Celeste Holm. David Wayne's portrayal of a self-absorbed, cruel detached husband is o.k. in a thankless role. Debbie Reynold's character is truly frightening."
2,not his best,"I love Sinatra movies. I love Reynolds. but not this one! It is about Charlie {Sinatra} who has a string of girls. His friend Joe comes out and sees them and he wants in but he is married.He loves his wife very much but he came to get a break and to see Charlie. Charlie meets Debbie Reynolds and instatanly he falls in love.and Joe thinks he is having fun with her instead of being in love. Joe starts making friends with one of Charlies girls and charlie really doesn't like it. It is just that he doesn't want to admit it. This movie is not that bad BUT if you are a man you willl probably not like it! all it was made for was girls I know because I am one!All it is , is a love movie."
4,The Tender Trap VHS,"This movie arrived timely, but somehow I missed that it was a VHS and not a DVD. It plays well though."
2,Cooking with spices,"This book was not what I expected. It tells all about the spices, but doesn't tell how to usethem. I was hoping to learn what sort of dishes to use some of the spices on my shelf in.I guess i expected more of a recipe book."
3,Piglet Costume Deluxe Baby,"As a father of twins, my wife and I decided to dress are kids up like Winnie the Pooh, and Piglet. Call us corny, but it was very cute and funny. Anyway, The Winnie the Pooh costume was perfect, however this Piglet costume was not up to the same quality. The inside fabric was very rigid and uncomfortable where the Pooh costume was nice and soft. If we didn't get the Winnie the Pooh costume we probably wouldn't know any different, but they should be making all the products with the same quality not just Winnie the Pooh."
5,This stuff works!,This flavor which is my favorite is no longer sold in my town. After trying cherry flavored I was not happy. I was thrilled to find this on amazon. Nothing is my experience takes sore throat pain away like this.
4,"Tastes disgusting, but really works","I am just getting over strep and tried everything to take the blowtorch burn out of the back of my throat. Lozenges didn't cut it. My favorite herbal tea came close, but didn't last long and it was tough to swallow.Chloroseptic was what my pharmacist suggested. The spray doesn't taste as good as the lozenges or the tea, but it offers the longest relief out of any of those options. And when you hurt, numbing the pain is what it's really about.Rebecca Kyle, January 2009"
1,never got the product,"I asked for chrome and got white. After multiple phone calls, I was finally told they didn't have chrome and they took it off my bill."
5,GREAT STUFF!,"I am a guitar player - I think I heard either ""Meet the Frog"" or ""In a Mellow Tone"" on WBGO;I bought this whole CD just for the one tune.It is GREAT...jammin' stuff.Ben Webster apparently pioneered that 'soft sax' sound you often hear on this compilation;it is very moving.If you just have a basic appreciation for Jazz and GOOD music, you will LOVE this.It's all here -'Meet the Frog' jumps...'In a Mellow Tone' swings...'That's All' just mellows you out...This is IT, baby!I think you'll love it!Jim HarrisUnion, NJ"
2,Literary Classic transformed on the silver screen,"Richard Brooks adaptation of Joseph Conrad's fascinating work Lord Jim, was received in 1965 to mixed reviews.The movie is an attempt at recasting Conrad's work in the action adventure genre. What is perhaps one of the most compelling works of character in English literature losses its power in the process. What it then becomes is lavishly told, ploddingly paced action adventure fare. And in this category it suffers greatly by comparison to the more recent Indiana Jones series of movies.The novel presents numerous challenges to the lead actor and director: the structure is complex, Jim speaks infrequently, and (most importantly) it deals with the inner substance of Jim's character. Bringing this together in a well told visual tale is an overwhelming challenge.Richard Brooks and Peter O'toole should be congratulated for their effort, but the results earned them only a plodding ""B"" movie."
3,Lawarence of the Sea,"This movie is like Lawrence of Arabia, just substitute the desert for sea, the story is alright (good), but not as classic as O'toole's performance in Lawrence of Arabia. In lord Jim O'toole is tormented by abandoning ship and spends the rest of the move trying to redeem himself. O'toole's is good and very believable as Lord Jim, the cinematography is beautiful but the story is lacking..........*****DO Not READ AHEAD/ PLOT SPOILER*****The ending was very weird, it's like O'toole's character Jim wanted to die. It seemed that no matter what he did, he could never redeem himself ."
3,reviewing Lord Jim,"An older movie with good action, reminded me of the era of world exploration where they were finding the deep dark places of intrigue..."
3,Could have been better.,"I bought this dvd thinking it had the complete street car ride I saw on 60 Minutes Overtime, but all it had was a repeat of the segment of the 60 Minutes program shown on July 10, 2011. I had to go back on the internet to watch the real film with a very nice musical score. It is at [...]. If it had been included, I would have given it 5 stars."
4,"Works great, crappy connectors, heavy","This product works exactly as stated and it is the perfect price. For the price, I would give it 5 stars. But since it is a review of the product, I only gave it four stars.Pros...#1 Cheap#2 Has most common connectors#3 Voltage divisions by 1.5vCons...#1 Weight. Copper is heavy, but it is not something you would want to carry around in your backpack.#2 Egg Design. It sticks up too high so it blocks the outlet above it."
1,jWIN JA-C52AC Adapter,"I have tried two different samples of this AC adapter which has an attractive price particularly with the settable outputs. Both samples failed to work as advertised. I tried using them with a Chamberlain intercom system that can be either battery operated or with an AC adapter with 12V input. These chargers made the intercom malfunction totally. Fortunately, when I disconnected the AC adapter, the intercom works fine on batteries and I will continue to use only batteries on the intercom. I did put a voltmeter on the output of each of these units and it came as no surprise to find that the output was not as rated but much higher. When set at 12V it was giving 22.8 V at the plug. When set at 6V the output was 11. Both samples behaved similarly and would not work with the intercom. This is junk and I will try to get Amazon to give me a refund on both units."
3,beach read,If you are looking for a quick read to pass the time this will do but it is not even rate with the best of his novels.
3,OK - not great,"I am an avid Kellerman fan - but this one was did not make it to my favorites. It was an OK read - entertaining enough, just not memorable."
5,kellerman fan,"I loved the book, as usual Jonathan Kellerman has written a book that I couldn't put down. I have read all of his books this one is definitely worth reading."
4,ALEX DELAWARE ** BOOK TWO,"Jonathan Kellermans' BLLOD TEST is the second book in the Delaware series and also my second Kellerman read, It was a good story, well done as we get to know Dr. Delaware more closely. A little slow in places and medically detailed but still worth the read. RECOMMENDED"
4,Interesting..,"Dr. Delaware gets thrown into a case concerning a sick little boy. He is kidnapped and Alex must help to get him back in the hospital. This book was different, which is what kept me reading. Just when I thought I had it figured out, I didn't. There are a lot of characters so make sure you pay attention. I would forget who was who at times. It was a twisted ending and well worth the read!"
4,COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN!,I'VE READ SEVERAL OF KELLERMAN'S ALEX DELAWARE NOVELS AND HAVE NOT BEEN DISAPPOINTED YET. BLOOD TEST IS NO EXCEPTION. IT GRABS YOUR ATTENTION FROM THE START AND IS DIFFICULT TO PUT DOWN. I DIDN'T WANT IT TO END.
3,Still practicing,"You immediately realize that this is an early Delaware novel. It seems as if Kellerman was still practicing then. He did not create the convincing characters we can find in his later novels when he wrote this book. And the plot is a little heavy, too. The climax is somewhat forced and improbable and comes before the actual ending, which is too transparent and obvious. We know exactly what is coming. Nevertheless, the book is quite a good read, a simple thriller, not too demanding, and it cannot cope with later novels by Kellerman."
3,Not the best of Alex Delaware,"Over the years I've read several of the Delaware novels. Thus far, I think this one has the most shortcomings. It was more predictable than usual, yet there were still some surprising alliances and shocking insanities to be found.I haven't read the Alex Delawares in order, and think this one was written at a point when Kellerman hadn't yet decided where Robin did-or did not-fit in. In other words, since Kellerman wasn't sure where to put her, she wasn't really THERE. One does look forward to Alex's pursuit of romance.And, as always, I appreciated the ease and sincerity of Alex's friendship with Milo."
3,Compelling read,"I liked the book and never got bored. On the other hand, I thought the character develop a little weak the secrets (don't want to ruin it for you) improbable. So not the best but a satisfying read."
1,Tedious,"A preposterous plot, an unlikable protagonist, set in a relentlessly depressing context.....why did I finish this book? The author is obviously intelligent, but it doesn't make this book worth reading. Save your eyesight!"
4,Starts out slow...but finishes with a bang,"This is my first exposure to JK...I am going to go back and start from the beginning of the Alex Delaware series. The beginning of the book was a bit slow (which could be because I didn't read the series in order). However, once I got to know that main characters, the book was clipped along at a fast pace. The last part of the book has many twists and keeps you wondering how it will all be resolved. The last 100 pages go very quickly."
2,A Let Down,"I was enthralled by the writing style of Kellerman in his previous book, When the Bough Breaks. I was completely let down by this one. I wanted so much for him to stick to the primary storyline with Woody, but instead, he concentrated on Woody and the Moodys. I hope the next one is better."
4,"A good, workmanlike mystery","I absolutely loved WHEN THE BOUGH BREAKS, so I was naturally eager to pursue more of Jonathan Kellerman's books. BLOOD TEST is good, but not as good as its predecessor. JK's ability to draw interesting characters is intact: the doctors and cult members in this book are memorable, and the resolution is thrilling. He really knows how to get the reader's adrenaline pumping! However, I thought the side plot regarding the divorce case was somewhat of a fifth wheel. It didn't seem to have anything to do with the main action, so why include it? Overall, though, I found myself wishing I lived a few more bus-stops away from work so that I could finish reading it before walking home from the corner, and am looking forward to reading OVER THE EDGE. Jonathan Kellerman is like a bag of potato chips: one is never enough"
2,Poorest Alex Delaware Novel,"I have read all of Kellerman's novels which feature Alex Delaware.This is by far the weakest entry in this series. I found it har dto believe it was written by the same author.The unsympathetic characters are so cartoonish it is hard to develop any sort of empahty for them. The plot plods alonglike a bad ""b"" nmovie from the 1930s. BY the time you reach the point of plot resolution, you no longer care what happens -- you just want it to be over."
5,Riveting. Captures the reader and doesn't let go.,"Jonathan Kellerman's Blood Test held me until the very end. Through the plot he told me enough to keep me holding on without spoiling the ending. The plot twisted and turned until I wasn't sure which way he was going next. He used the character Alex Delaware to the fullest in this book. Unlike some suspense novels that feed you the ending throughout the book, Kellerman eases the reader into the ending and unravels it all at once at the end. This is an aspect that makes Kellerman and Blood Test a different kind of reading experience all together. GREAT BOOK!"
2,Religious Cult Again,"If I am not mistaken,this is Jonathan Kellerman's third book involving a suspect religious cult. It gets a little tiresome. The plot was not as suspenseful as his books usually are. But it is easy reading, and the writing is entertaining enough to read if you are a Jonathan Kellerman fan."
5,NEAR PERFECT,"Marcia delivers piano as sizzling uptempo or in yearning ballad forms and comes out sounding fab either way. The title track and Crawfishin' are instant classics, and all her slower moments are sweet and tender.Not a duff track in the batch. The song blend of originals and covers is well focused, and lends creedance to the great history of music and life on the Bayou (Delbert McClinton, Randy Newman).I've listended to a lot of blues influenced ivory ticklers on CD, and I've seen many a player hit the 88 keys live and in person, but Marcia delivers the right stuff from start to finish.Her voice is warm and welcoming. Session heavyweight Doyle Bramhall (Sr.), joins in to add spice to the party in session.Next time the neighbors are coming over for a BBQ, slip into something comfortable and try on a little Marcia Ball..this Poodle is worth picking up."
5,Superb Sequel!,"If you liked the first volume of Cinema Serenade, you will love this one. It features beautiful, lush arrangements and Perlman's always gorgeous playing. This record is also exquisitely engineered and the balance between the Pops and Perlman is perfect. You want this recording."
4,Can't believe how much I still love this film...,"I was in my early teens when this film came out. I remeber wanting to see it because I was a HUGE fan of Jim Hutton's, and for the most part I enjoyed Paul Burk.I was so impressed how good Jim Hutton was in this film. He scared me SILLY! Now here it is 30 years later, and he still scared me. Dispite the so so script, this was a really cool B film.I am still disappointed at Paul Burk's performance, not his best. But still a good film for a late night shiver."
3,Fooled again,"First about this story -- not bad despite having less action and romance than most Trek books. The plot has some mystery, but doesn't really get you lost or confused.But once again Pocket Books has come up with another way to dupe us out of our money rather than just giving us a good product so that we keep coming back. The entire first 6 books of the series have very little interaction with each other, except that you must get the seventh to have a conclusion. And the seventh is only available, at this date, in hardback. I was more than slightly annoyed by the Rihannsu ploy where no indication was given of a continuing series and the conclusion is still not out after more than a year. This ploy is another of the same character (or lack thereof). If you like stories contained in a series of books, that's fine. I sometimes enjoy them. But tell us what we are getting. Don't hide it.I've read book four (DS9) also. I found it even better than this one."
1,Star Trek: Gateways Book One - One Small Step,This is getting totally pitiful. The mini-series junk trying to span stories through all the different genres of StarTrek in my opinion belongs in the trash. Pocket Books is making a big mistake. I for one only care for the original cast books. I buy one to read (which I've read them all) and I get no ending unless I go read Next Generation and then the next genre and the next and the one after that.YUCK!!
3,Just an appetizer,"When I bought the book I had pretty high expectations. I was a little disappointed with the book. Like some people have pointed out it had little action. At the end I got plenty interested but then it leaves you hanging. The characters for me were pretty accurate, (Kirk, Spock, Scotty, etc.) but the Petraw really didn't intrigued me that much since there was so little about them and pretty similar except for one major character. The book is pretty much an introduction into the series. Hopefully the other five books have more action and the 7th one should tie everything together."
2,Triumph of commerce over art,"This whole book is essentially an epilogue to the TOS episode ""That Which Survives."" So if you've always wanted to see what happens immediately after the events of that episode, then this is the book for you. But if not, then you might want to skip it.The characterization is OK, and obviously Wright has been watching her TOS videos. In fact, that's part of the problem for me. This book is a by-the-numbers pastiche. The characters all say and do what they would in a TV episode, but who cares? There's no real story. It's all a matter of tying up loose ends from the TV episode and creating some new loose ends for the other 6 books in this Gateway series. This book owes its existence to a marketing strategy, not to artistic inspiration. It exists only to fill the TOS slot in the Gateway series.And be warned: this book ends in a cliffhanger that you have to buy the hardcover book to resolve."
3,Why the combinations,I enjoyed the book and was excited about the hung ending.I jumped to read the second book to find out it had nothing to do with book one. I am not familure with these new characters and had to relean who they are.If I wanted the read the new frontair I would have bought the new frontair.Pocketbooks made a booboo with this series.I will still read the rest of this series because I am still curious what happend from book one
1,Susan Wright may be the worst writer...,"that the editors of Star Trek employ. Between this book and her ""Dark Passions"" duology, I cannot for the life of me figure out why they continue to allow her to work when there are so many other authors available who actually know a thing or two about little things like characters, plot, pacing, and dialogue.Absolute rubbish."
1,Worked 3 times and died,"I knew this wasn't exactly OEM quality, but it should have lasted a year or two! Better luck in the junk yard I suppose!"
2,Graphics not painted,My only complaint (and it's a big one) is that the graphic of a cigarette is not painted white as indicated in the photo.
4,Nice,Product as described. Sturdy construction allows repeated abuse/use without failure. Only negative thing I saw was the black tip was a tad to long for my application. The included parts catalog was a bonus.
4,Base in great lighter in different from the pic,"Easy to install and has worked now for 3 months with no problems. The only con I have is the lighter is to tall and isn't the one pictured. I have to remove it from the base the close the lid that's suppose to cover it on my car. Isn't a big deal since I'm using it for power instead, but if you want to keep the lighter in the base and your car has a cover for the lighter and ashtray it may not fit correctly."
1,poor product quality,The ground connector broke off immediately while connecting a ground connector. Returned and bought a replacement from local parts store for comparable price.
3,It Works,"This works just fine. Except, I can't plug anything else into it like a charger for my phone or anything, because it fries it. This has happened a couple times. Maybe it's a voltage thing? I have no idea. Loud pops, smoke, and a bad smell would happen if I plugged anything else into this adapter! I wish there were more details in the description about it. As a cigarette lighter, it's great. As an adapter for anything else, it's bad. For me, at least."
5,"Finally, a book without empty buzzwords and cliches","So many business books these days are full of buzzwords and slogans -- stuff that just doesn't lead to any deep insight or positive change. ""22 Keys"" is different. It shows respect for its readers. It gets into the underlying issues and challenges that affect employee satisfaction. And it's written in a neat style -- down to earth, personable, genuine. The author seems to have done his homework too -- he knows what's happening in the real work world. In terms of a criticism (actually, more of a suggestion), it would nice to have an audiotape version of this book, because people spend so much time in their cars going to and from work."
5,"A ""must read"" if job satisfaction is important to you!","This book provides so much useful information -- practical action ideas, real stories about real people, profiles of meaningful workplaces, a meaningful workplace scorecard, even ""believe it or not"" sidebars that show what really goes on in some organizations. My favorite sections were the end-of-chapter ""reality checks,"" which you can use to evaluate your workplace in terms of the 22 ""keys."" These quickie assessments helped me and my colleagues take the temperature of our current situation -- and we've been using this as a starting point for focused conversation and improvement planning. If you want to increase job satisfaction -- your own and your colleagues' -- this book is required (and fun!) reading."
5,22 Keys to Creating a Meaningful Workplace,"After reading Tom Terez ""22 Keys to Creating a Meaningful Workplace"", I was amazed at just how many of the simple things I had forgotten in my daily role as a supervisor. Tom's book puts real life experiences into play and makes you think about your role in the workplace. I had the sincere fortune to hear and meet Mr. Terez and I found him to be one of the most interesting speakers I have heard in quite sometime. I have placed ""22 Keys"" into our training program for not only supervisors but for ALL employees in our division. I want to sincerely thank Tom Terez for writing such a wonderful learning tool. The ""22 Keys"" are simple ideas we should exemplify in every day life. I know we will be using the book for many years to come."
1,Great topic but all fluff!,"I just can't understand the 5-star reviews this book has received. After two years of research and focus groups, all the author could come up with are self-evident keys to meaningful work like ""Respect"" and ""Acknowledgment"".The ""Reality Check"" assessments of each of the 22 keys at the end of each chapter provide the only real substance in the book.This extremely important subject deserved much better treatment. Far superior presentations of similar topics include:In Good Company - Don Cohen & Laurence PrusakIntrinsic Motivation at Work - Kenneth W. Thomas"
2,intriguing premise but disappointing ending.,i've read and enjoyed ms. dewberry's other books but found this one disappointing. the character development wasn't much but the ending didn't work at all. i wish she'd taken time to develop this more because it's a wonderful idea and could've been a great book.
1,Sacrament of Lies,"What was touted as a murder mystery was in truth a uneven monologue by the suspicious daughter of a power hungry politician. What you found out at the very beginning, you knew at the end, but the plot was never developed enough to keep you wondering.Ms. Dewberry has a fine style of writing, but needs to work on character development and intrigue."
3,Shocked,"The story was good, the writing was good, BUT - - - I was more than a little shocked at the usage of ""four letter"" words. Could definitely have done without that!"
5,A Unique Look at Philadelphia History,"Sam Bass Warner Jr. has given readers a unique study of the historic city's transformation as a maritime giant to manufacturing and retailing hub, to today's service economy. The perfect companion to the urban historian's landmark study on Boston's suburbs."
2,The Incredibly Boring City,"I believe that it is human nature to not want to read what yuo are forced to read. And i was assigned to read this in my HST301 class at oakland university. But goodness, Mr. Sam Bass Warner is interested in things that I am flat out not interested in. My teacher, for some reason, is just fascinated with the idea of privatism, however all it is is saying capitalism in a different way. I'm sorry I just don't care when Philadelphia put in waterworks and who were great contributors to the city. . .oh well"
5,A SIMPLY DELIGHTFUL SPECIAL FOR KIDS,"This is one of the better Christmas specials for young kids and was a favorite of my teenager when he was little. Pooh, Christopher Robin and the rest of the gang all write a letter to Santa Claus to tell him what they want for Christmas. After mailing the letter, Pooh realizes he forgot to ask for a gift. The gang then try and get the letter back and send it north but it just blows back. They soon realize it's Christmas Eve and it's too late. Pooh then tries to disguise himself as Santa to give the gang a nice Christmas and eventually everything works out in the long run.A very good special with heart and laughs. The animation is very good unlike the regular Pooh TV show of the 190's and the late Paul Winchell does the voice of Tigger. Delightful and kids will love it."
4,"Kollektsiya - Zherar Depard'e, P'er Rishar (DVD NTSC)","A very nice collection of movies with Gerard Depardieu and Pierre Richard. The movies are in Russian, but sometimes you can hear French language in the background. Here's the problem. Normally, you'd hear only Russian speech, which happens almost all the time in all movies on this DVD, but sometimes, during watching it, the sound suddenly would change and you can hear clearly French speech and a different voice in Russian (translation), quite different from the original voice from the translation. It doesn't happen often throughout the DVD, only a few times, that's why I don't rate this version with 5 Stars! Other than that, the picture is nice quality - no complaints."
4,Dvd was Great,"Dvd came in as expected, was new. However when I opened the dvd, the disk was out of its place. (Like when I could hear the disk move around in the box when i shook the package) It really bothered me until i checked the back. But it was safe and sound...well besides 2 or 3 scratches haha. Movie was amazingly good!"
4,Add to your Gundam collection,If you already seen Gundam Wing you have to see Endless Waltz. If finishes the Gundam Wing series. This DVD wasn't so highly price like other items sold through amazon.
4,Understanding,"this movie alone is amazing. with its designs, characters, and storylines, this is a must have anime movie to have for years. but if you really want to get a great feel for this movie, look at the t.v show first then look at the movie directly after the shows. that way you can get the feeling the whole gundam wing series. but if you like wars video games and stuff, you may want to try the video games of final fantasy 7,8,& 9 with the legend of the dragoon, and the wild arms games. but it you not me. the endless waltz is all in reference to those games. with the games, you will get that 'gundam-ish' to it all the episodes with the movie. please make sure when oyu look at the movie, try your best to replace your self with any pilot or character that you feel strong as. that brings a sense of reality it to it because it reflex a little of life today."
4,umm.... not the worst ending...,"I thought that the movie would really be something, but i got a little dissapointed. i thought that since the tv seris was so good, i thought the movie would be better, but it's not. It got a little boring in the middle, too much stuff were said which could be erased. Anyways, the ending was okay i guess."
5,The coolest anime movie ever!,"I'm a major Gundam Wing fan (Yes I'm a girl)and I agree that the animation was awesome; loads better than the series animation. I love this movie so much, and I'm so glad my friend Holly got this DVD for me. I love the gallery and the MS encyclopedia, but my favorite part was the ending when Duo chokes on the rice cake! HA! I hate the fact that Heero and Relena were the main characters in the Cartoon network movie(which I thought was terrible) but this DVD is my salvation! I LOVE QUATRE and am soooo glad that in the theatrical version of the movie, in the extra footage there's a whole lot of him going around! Hehe, I love the new song they play instead of White Reflection(don't get me wrong I love that song), And certain things make a lot more sense to me now. This is a must see for Gundam Wing fans!"
3,"Awesome movie, but...","First of all, I love this movie. I would not have ordered it if I didn't. The only reason I gave the three stars was because of the item itself. It arrived on time. Packaging was alright, but could of used bubble wrap. DVD cover was in good condition as well as the manual. After that, it's all pretty much a lie. The disc was hanging on the clips that held the manual. The disc itself had scratches on the top and bottom. Nothing ""like new"" about it besides the cover and manual. The good thing is it works fine (from seeing the menu and extras). Lets just see if it continues to work when I actually watch the movie."
4,i like cheese,"the gundam series and this movie/oav are ok but nothing beats the original gundam. try some other anime. neon genesis evangelion is good, try lain if u liked the matrix. the only good anime they show on toonami is tenchi muyo and tenchi universe. dragonball was ok, but Z and GT aren't exactly the smartest- with all the grunting is should be called constapation warriors."
2,The Unedited Version is better!,"I don't really like the edited version. It has no blood or swear words. Without them, I don't think this should be PG-13. It should be more of a PG. The Uncut version is also better because it's longer!"
3,An Ending to a Terrible Series,"So after being tortured by the Gundam Wing episodes which repeated, and repeated, I was NOT looking forward to this, I was right. There isn't much here, but there are some good mecha.I find the Altron Custom stunning, or stunning for Gundam Wing. Sure, it's very much like the Dragon Gundam from G Gundam, but it's been um. done in a better animated, visually appealing way. Then there's that fight, between Wing Zero Custom (lol) and the Altron Custom. Ok, the Deathscythe Hell was BAD, it had a scythe, with TWO BLADES! Sandrock was ok, Heavyarms was terrible, you get the picture.In this ""Special Edition"" version, you get Minami Takayama (Two Mix's) ""Last Impression"" enjoy it. It's the BEST part of the movie.Fairly good ending, sort of, better than I expected. I'm not telling you to go buy it, but it looks good on the shelf."
1,"Edited, schmedited.","This is the ""edited for television"" version of Endless Waltz that aired on Toonami, and the extras are sparse as well. Skip this one and get the Special Edition instead."
5,Endless Waltz,"IM A BIG GUNDAM FAN, Endless Waltz AND GUNDAM WING, HAS TO BE THE BEST OF ALL GUNDAM. Endless Waltz HAS IT ALL! THE STORY(A YEAR AFTER THE 195 WAR) SHEDS LIGHT ON THE MYSTERIOUS PASTS OF THE G-BOYS AND THE MISSION OF OPERATION METEOR, THE STORY IS POWERFUL, NEW MS, DELUXE VIDEO, THREE EPISODE VIDEO VERSION, AND MORE! A HAVE-TO-SEE FOR ALL ANIME FANS!"
5,A must get for gundam fan or anime fan,well i wasn't much a gundam fan when i saw gundam wing but when i saw endless waltz i was amazed. That made me a gundam fan for life. My favorate part of this movie is wing zero showing is wing danfg that was nice
3,Enjoyed This,I own this movie myself and bought it for a friend for Christmas so he would stop stealing my DVD all the time. He was pretty stoked when he opened and absolutely loves the movie.
5,Gundam Wing Endless Waltz,"It was a very good movie. The sad part of the movie that the Gundams where gone for ever. A true master pice, the uncut DVD is better then the uncut VHS. My favorit Gundam is Wing Zero, the why that Zero dies is sad. If you like Gundam Wing your going to like Endless Waltz."
5,The Real Conclusion to the Series,"For fans of the GW series, this DVD is a must see. The series left off when the conflicting parties were brought down, but the real political struggle between the colonies and Earth were still up in the air. The political struggles are finally put to rest as they break the endless waltz of peace - rebellion - war. The past of each gundam pilot and their involvement in operation meteor is revealed and they all reach the end of their personal journey. This series does not end until you see this feature. I also do not recommend this title if you have not seen the series."
5,The best Gundam Wing explanation.,"I just want to say that if you liked Gundam Wing, you must see The Movie: Endless Waltz. This is just the best part of Gundam Wing. It finishes the series not so good ending, it gives you a little bit of info on the past of the pilots & the complete explanation of Operation Meteor. Plus, you get both sides of the story here. You get the original 3 uncut OAV episodes, plus you get the uncut, added scenes, movie version. What more can you ask for? Excellent features? Got it. From its Mobile Suit Gallery to the Textless Endings, this DVD is the perfect addition to any Gundam collection."
4,endless waltz ends the series,"like other movies based on television if you watched and liked the show you will like the movie. but with all honesty this movies did not have enough mobile suit action for my taste. and if you only watched to OAV you were really ripped off in the realm of mobile suit battles. As far as the actual story of the movie it cannot stand on its own. but if you buy the gundam wing series, which I recommend you do, then you need to get this movie to complete the story.over all I liked it.but then again I watched the show."
3,dissapointing (sort of),I have seen the series on Cartoon Network but what I didn't like was that it wasn't uncut.It's just not the same if it's uncut.I have also seen the movie Endless Walz on Cartoon Network and this wasn't uncut either.That's why i give it 3 stars out of 5.I didn't buy the video yet but that's because i don't know if it's uncut or not.I know the DVD is but i'm not sure about the video.I'd really like to know.Anyway I really loved the movie.It's great but i suggest that if you've never seen the series then you shouldn't buy it right away because it's just going to be confusing.Otherwise you should buy it if you don't really care if it's uncut or not.I asure you it's absolutley GREAT.
4,GundamMan,I Think the Movie is a perfect ending to the Gundam Wing Series but it could of been better.For one they didn't show that much of the Gundams and Moble Suits.And two it could of been a bit longer.And three it dosn't show that much fighting either.But other than that this movies is GREAT!!!
4,"Great Movie, Bad Editing","I love this movie but they cut out half of the movie and what the cut out was not even bad! I own the unedited version rated pg-13 for some violence, 2 bad words (the other way to say darn and heck), and some blood. They cut out important parts in the movie to make it shorter. Personally i would have rated the unedited pg if there wasn't for the very end when 2 people where shot. Trust me get the unedited it is easier to understand and it is a heck of a lot better!"
5,The best movie you could ever watch.,"This is the gretest movie I have ever seen and the best Gundam Wing episode with cool new looks for the Gundams new enimies and tons of action. The movie starts off a year later after the final battle and episode, after a year of peace between the colonies and the earth sphere Marie Maya Kushrunada starts the war up again so she can carey out her fathers will and so five Gundam pilots are going to try and stop her but there's a problem the Gundams have been sent into the sun to be destroyed can the Gundam pilots get there Gundams back and stop her. If your a Gundam Wing fan you have to buy this and if your not a Gundam Wing fan buy it any way or else God will smite thee."
5,Beautiful End to a Wonderful Series,"Gundam Wing is the best Japanese animation series ever to come out of Japan. It's no wonder that the conclusion turns out to be a beautifully made film.It starts out with the Gundam pilots sending their Gundams hurtling towards the sun. Peace has began as Queen Relena Peacecraft assumes her role as minister of the Earth. All of a sudden a new leader barges in. Her name is Mariemeia Kushrenada, daughter of the famed OZ leader, Trieze Kushrenada. Mariemeia takes the role of a leader with her ruthless grandfather Dakim Barton. They want Mariemeia to be the absolute ruler of the world. If the Earth refuses, she will send one of the space colonies towards Earth. Wonderful plot. You will understand why in the movie that Dakim is Mariemeia's puppet master actually guiding her to an ""Endless Waltz."" This refers to the endless cycle of ""war, peace and revolution."""
4,A Must For Gundam Wing Fans!,"All fans of the Gundam Wing series will love this movie. The movies begins one year after the events that took place at the end of the series. Peace has finally been acheived and the gundams are set to be destroyed, but when a new threat emerges, will the five gundam pilots be ready for another war? This special edition version of the movie is awesome. It includes a version of the movie that has extended scenes and different ending clips than the ones shown in the Toonami version. I personally prefer this version because it provides more plot insight."
5,My FIRST DVD Purchase - And It Was Worth Every Cent,"This was the best way I could think of ""baptizing"" my DVD player after I received it - and I haven't been let down. It's just a matter of time before the ""Complete Operations"" Boxed Set joins my collection."
5,A movie of nonstop epic proportion.,"This movie takes place where the gundam wing series ends(I recomend the series also). It is AC 196. Mariemaia Kushrenada, the daughter of Treize, launches an all out assualt on the ESUN'S headquarters. They hold Relena hostage and declare war against Earth. I really thought this was the best movie ever. The mech desighns are awesome and the story really shows viewers a lot about the Gundam Pilots past. Once again Yoshiyuki Tomino has proved Gundam is an anime series of epic proportion. I think also the fact that Hero is not the leader in the movie is a great way to make it. Quatre is definently the sole leader in te movie. All of the Gundams(except maybe sandrock) have been redesighned. Good job Nippon Sunrise. Peace out you Gundam fans out there."
2,BORING!,"I don't understand why this series is so popular. I rented this movie to TRY and get into it. And I tried HARD! But as this movie went on my mind got bored and went elsewhere. I began thinking about a funny episode of ""Family Guy."" Then I realized I missed an important scene in the movie. Not that I understood a single thing in it in the first place. The plot is so dry but what makes it dry is the voice acting. Somebody please get these characters personalities! They all talk in this flat, straight, serious voice. It's like they're all asleep and their mouths run on copilot. I think this could be a pretty good anime. The animation is beautiful and the character design is well done. But all the boys are a little too pretty if you ask me. I've heard rumors some of them are gay. At least if they were it would make the story a little more interesting. My only real complaint is the voice acting. Get some actors who have more than one tone in their voices and this movie might be pretty good."
1,Bad Ending,"Personnally, I thought Endless Waltz was a MAJOR let down. The actual Endless Waltz series in Japan is MUCH MUCH better. This one, they just automatically turn into the new upgraded gundams, yet at the conclusion of Gundam Wing, they were using the Mid Staged Upgrades. If you notice the Alto-Long gundam, Wu-Fei's, has completely changed between the series and the Movie, and it give no explanation. Along with the other gundams undergoing a complete change. Also it has a horrible plot to it. I think this movie sucked bad. If you want to see the REAL continuation, Watch the actual Japaneese Series."
1,Blah,"I liked this movie until I found out how much it rips off Zeta and ZZ Gundam. I mean, what the heck? Mariemaia is such a blatantly condensed copy of Mineva that it's almost funny.Another problem I had is Wufei's random alliance switch. Also, I think the ending was pretty dumb. I mean, no war again, forever? That's just too hard to believe.Yeah, I know I only touched the very surface... but it's Wing, not worth too much of my time."
5,Fantastic,"I made a tape of a scratchy vinyl recording of this years ago, and it is still one of my favorites. Both Ella and Louis are absolutely wonderful on this. ""Stompin at the Savoy"" and ""Autumn in NY"" are both great, but they are all great. You can't go wrong."
5,One of the best.,"This album is so good. I can't believe I only discovered recently. The playing is superb, the material even better. One of my favorites."
5,"""You Should Have Heard Me When I Was Really Playing""","Despite the goofy title track and the orchestral arrangements, he still was, or they still were letting him--play, that is. Who knows? All I can say is Wes is still absolutely wonderful on this one. Please don't be put off by bad reviews and the prospect of Mary Poppins."
4,Interesting documentary about an unusual topic.,"There isn't much out in the big wide world about this particular subculture. I wish the film was a little more in-depth, but as an introduction to a very interesting topic, it's good. It follows a few guys, all interested in castration for differing reasons. They're probably not who you expect. I could have listened to a 2 hour film about any single one of them, though. They're all interesting people, for sure."
3,"Good, not great","This is a film of interviews of various people involved in elective castration in the the USA: some eunuchs, licensed testicle removers, and unlicensed. I would have liked to have seen more of the operations and close-up shots of the scrotal area.Good, but didn't delve deeply enough in the topic."
5,Handy,"Just so you know, a hot dog wont fall through this (I was wondering that when I bought it). Not much to say about it otherwise, but sturdy enough & it helped me cook my burgers while camping & not on the nasty outdoor grills provided by the campsite."
4,"Pretty good, though some songs are uninteresting","Some of the songs are slow and boring, but this CD set has some stuff that's hard to find. It's probably worth $10 just for Chick Corea's song ""Fickle Funk"" which is on an album that is very hard to find and has to be imported (Secret Agent) and can't be found on Itunes. ""Party Sex"" by Roy Rogers is also very exciting and upbeat with a rippin' vibes solo, and ""Hot Stuff"" by Wayne Henderson has a great groove. My other two favorites are ""Candido's Funk"" and ""Lord of the Golden Baboon"" which is pretty wacko and awesome.I am a drummer too young to be alive in the 70s, so of course I am a poor authority on 70s jazz-funk, although I do play those styles of music today. Enjoy! or get some Weather Report or Return to Forever's Romantic Warrior album or Mahavishnu Orchestra's Birds of Fire. Yeah!"
1,Huh?,"This is an awful movie. Westerns which attempt to portray actual characters, or events, ought to do a better job with their history. The Long Riders is a good western, and really good history, with the same subject which shows it can be done.Movies are movies, though, and Gladiator doesn't suffer from its laughable depiction Roman Imperial politics. This movie, instead, suffers from bad acting, a bad script, silly dialogue, and every other ill which generally plagues bad movies."
1,PU,It stinks. The 2 mass murderers are depicted as poor victims of society. They're cocky and stupid in the show. The movie puts Pinkerton in bad light. Of course cocky and stupid people will enjoy loathing him. Bad acting all around.
2,Fictionalized Account of a Truly Fascinating Story,"This movie has it all poor acting, glaring historical errors and totally unbelievable events. While I don't expect any film to be a completely accurate by any means the beginning of the film is one of the most fabricated and unbelievable retellings of why the James brothers started robbing banks. Jesse James was a hero to many people and that is accurately portrayed in the film. The acting and lines are forced and corny and the locations where it was chosen to be filmed are poor, yes mainly in Northwest Arkansas but the mountains in Minnesota were the worst. Let's just say there's a reason this move wasn't released in many theaters and only took home $50,000."
3,Could have been better...,"One more concert recorded live, but without any surprise.There are few harmony vocals, except with Pete. With the exception of Albert and Peter (and sometimes Gavin), the musicians are poorly filmed (where is Brian?). Musically, I think that Albert should use again his Telecaster guitar : he does not need a tremolo and the sound of his MusicMan is far too ""metallic"".A french fan which expects something better on the next DVD/CD release"
5,Eternal Truth,"These reflective,honest and wholly recitable poems are an endless delight.Who can argue with their truths?Maybe the (...) moral prig who will be a millennia dead and forgotten while the eternal Omar shines a light of realness and honesty in a world full of flowers and forests loving nitwit poets and poeple (...) who insist that life only be seen through the view of his religion.Go read the nonsensical,idiotic,mystical blather of Rumi if you want your poets ""spiritual"".If you have taste, read Khayyam. Grade:A+"
4,not bad,A little repetitive...No point in worrying... enjoy life at the moment... can't control birth or death so lets get drunk and make loveBut pretty.
2,Nice Try,"Everybody is entitled to translate from another language, but FitzGerald did it as a quasi-translation and wound up with a recognized masterpiece. If you want to know what Khayyam really said, read this book. If youn want literature, read the FitzGerald version."
5,A Sublime Meditation On The Human Predicament,"This beautifully illustrated edition of Omar Khayyam's classic poem is a gem. The illustrations complement the lyrical imagery of the poem. Two editions of Fitzgerald's translation are included, with the second including additional quatrains, and representing a mature and slightly darker reading of the poem. The introduction contains a lot of interesting information, but don't be misled. Far from being a work of skepticism, this beautiful poem reflects deep-thinking belief."
3,A Very different (and probably more accurate) Rubaiyat,"Fitzgerald's version of the Rubaiyat has long been one of my favorites, from a very early age. My son recently gave me Avery's version and it is ideed very different.His introduction does set the context squarely. None the less I felt there must be some relation between these versions. So far, I have been able to associate some verses from the two versions. In all cases, one or more from Avery to a single one from Fitzgerald.It would have been nice if(it were possible) the author had made some attempt to make that association. After all, the Fitzgerald version has a rather unique status.This version does not have the grace of Fitzgerald's but it is. nonetheless, worth having."
1,The Terrors of Farming,"This was a dull book. It told the story of Peter and his farming life. I felt that it was boring, and it did not hold my attention. It was hard to finish one page, let alone the entire book!"
2,Mixed Blessing,"Although the JVC plays really well -- indeed, it has resurrected many tapes from my library that are nearly unplayable on other VCRs -- it has some serious shortcomings. For one, I'm having trouble playing retail tapes -- some tapes you rent or buy to watch a movie just won't play on this VCR. The VCR makes a winding down sound and spits it out. And just try to dub anything with it! You can't use the jog/shuttle to advance/reverse frames while it is in Record Pause. It does not pause immediately. It does not begin recording immediately from Record Pause. In short: a great VCR to play back tapes you've made from broadcasts, but otherwise: watch out!"
4,Colleen is very nice,"Colleen is very nice, i like her since the survivor series, on animal movie, she looked so cute and nice. rob is quite fun too, but i like deuce bigallow better than this since the plot of animal is more 'dr doolitle' way to me. anyway, this is quite funny movie, comedy lovers should watch it."
1,My Dog could make a better movie,This movie was the worst. Don't get me wrong. I have liked other movies in the past that have starred SNL actors like Tommy Boy and Happy Gilmore. But this was a waste. A huge waste. The funniest part is when he does a dolphin swim in the pond and that whole scene is on the commercial. Don't see this movie.
1,"Vapid, Stupid, Waste of Time","My son (age 13) had heard this was a good movie, so I took him. We both felt that the time would have been better spent poking sharp sticks under our fingernails. It is insulting that Hollywood thinks so little of the time and money we spend on entertainment that they would stick something as empty and dumb into the theaters."
5,Rob is the MAN!,"Rob Scrneider is one funny guy. This is another great comedy. If you liked Duece Bigalo, you will love this flick!!"
2,This animal needs extinction,"Unfunny and only for people with wild humor, or on drugs.This is definitely a Rob Schneider movie however, since all the gross out humor is right down his cat alley. The animals aren't funny, the script isn't funny, and even Ed Asner is not funny, which makes this, you guessed it, an unfunny movie. For a room full of 15 year olds only, but I think they might have better things to do besides this."
4,Classic Rob Schneider entertainment,"I have always liked The Animal, it is a very entertaining movie. It has a good pace with a lot of silly humor, and John C. McGinley makes a wonderful co-star as usual."
1,AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL! ZERO STARS!,"If you didn't throughly understand my headline let me reiterate... THIS MOVIE IS AWFUL!Propbably one of the worst movies I've ever seen! I didn't even laugh once! The jokes are dumb, and the comedic timing is so off its sad. AND THE ENDING IS SOOOOOOO STUPID! This is probably Rob Schneider's worst film by far. Painful to watch!"
4,Funnier than I expected,"Went to this movie to see Coleen, a favorite from Survivor. She did a great job and I look forward to seeing her in other shows. But, the real reward for our ticket price was the absolute hilarity of Rob Schneider's performance. The macho cop was well cast, also, and the whole experience was delightful. Congratulations to Coleen on her first movie, an all around success."
1,but a gun to my head and shoot,"its a comedy with a hot gunbarrell pointed to your head begging for a good shot, this is what it was like fot me, good awful and my head hurt. though the funniest part is when he slaps the goat on the ass and it kicks his back, but otherwise, ahhhhhhh, (click)...(gunshot)..no more please. horrible acting and Colleen Haskell(Survivor) is cute but doesnt cut the fact that theres no story to this one. bury me now."
2,Skip this one,"This film is bad!I saw it on the first night it came out,and boy was it a waste of money!The film is about a guy training to be a cop but he never passes the test.Shortly after words he has a car accident. He is found by a strange doctor who replaces his damaged body parts with animal body parts,causing him to act in different ways.I am a fan of Rob Schneider but this just was not good.If you go see this film I wish you good luck.Later."
1,Terrible,"Don't rent this DVD and certainly DON'T BUY IT! Animal is terrible. The Movie has no point at all, plus isn't even funny. Don't touch this movie. Horrible, pitifull. It deserves a half a star!"
1,As bad as it gets!,"The Animal is not an unimpressive movie due to the fact that it appeals to a low denominator, or because it is silly. It doesn't pretend otherwise, so you cannot hold that against it.What is bad about the Animal is its almost complete lack of humor. It is pure silliness. I cannot say that I even snickered once. You may find it hard to believe that I thought Schnieder's last movie 'Duece Bigalow' was hilarious. I couldn't stop laughing. So I went to see the Animal with high hopes, but my expectations were never met. Rob Schnieder clearly has the role of ner do well doofus down pat. But the Animal simply fails to deliver. While Colleen Haskell is a welcome prescence, she doesn't save the movie from being a complete waste. Thumbs down."
3,I was left a lil disapointed.,"I like Rob Schneider, he is a funny actor. But this movie was just too corny for me....not that some of his other movies arn't..but this one was a lil over the top with stupidness. It did have it's moments but I felt jipped by the end of it. It could of been alot better that it was."
5,"Great movie, don't know where this bad rap is coming from","Here's the lowdown on the movie:CAST: Stars Rob Schneider (Big Daddy, Saturday Night Live) and Colleen Haskell (Survivor)PLOT: When Marvin (Rob's charater) gets into a car crash, he is in quick need of organs and blood to save his life. But when he is back oh his feet, he finds out his half brained doctor put different animal parts into him. He later meets up with Colleen's charater and they fall in love but the animal parts come to haunt him as he can't stop do beastly things like eat fish and running like a cheetah. That's all I'll tell you, you'll have to get the movie to know the rest.WHY GET IT?: It is a extremely funny movie, I've watched it ten times and still laugh at all the jokes. Schneider and Haskell are both great in it. It's a must have."
1,The animals are afraid to eat and crap.,"Rob Schneider is okay, but let me make this perefectly clear, I do not like movies with monkeys in them. Collen Haskell is in her first film. She was a CBS SURVIVOR contestant on the very first SURVIVOR show. She did not win, but she did get the role with Rob Schneider in this film. With a good fresh face and a refreshing innocence about her, we can see why she was cast.Rob Schneider was a player on NBC's Saturday Night Live in 1990-94.Norm Macdonald was a player on NBC's Saturday Night Live in 1993-98. Norm plays a hunter in this film.Instead of this film, watch AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON (1981).Adam Sandler was one of the Executive Producers on this one. That should tell you something.DVD includes two audio commentaries, a 21-minute Comedy Central Network program on the making of ""The Animal"".In ""Special Features"", ""Badger Delivery"", turn on this feature for cutting-room floor deleted scenes to appear when you click on the icon during the film."
1,A Wretched Film!!,"Once again, here comes another stinker starring Terrance Howard. Was he behind on the mortgage or what? Terrance Howard and Ving Rhames are too talented for this. The thug gone straight routine is getting kind of monotonous. Why can't writers come up with something more original. With the downright horrible storyline and camcorder-like film, no wonder this mess went straight to DVD!!"
3,If you have nothing better to do,"This movie is pretty fun. Pretty pointless - the plot revolves around the exploits of failed cop Marvin Mange who has a humungously bad car crash after swerving to avoid a performing seal in the middle of the road and is put together with animal parts by an eccentric scientist . If you have nothing better to do and the opportunity comes up to watch this film, go ahead, I wouldn't bother purchasing it.Incidentally, although it falls in to the wide band of 'gross out movies', it is not actually as gross as some of the more extreme offerings in this ouevre. Probably the most 'obscene' scene is Schneider licking his own private parts. Is that so shocking?Overall - Inoffensive, harmless, fairly funny and mildly entertaining."
4,go see it,"if you liked deuce bigalow you should like the animal. there are some parts that don't work that's why i gave it 4 stars, however, the joke's i felt were pretty funny. it's definetly a movie i'll own."
3,One of Schinder's best,"Rob Schinder has always been funny to me, but when I say his first starring role in Deuce Bigalow, I was highly upset.Seeing Deuce Bigalow proved my theory that not all comics can cary their own film just ask David Spagde. Back in the summer of 2001 I saw The Animal and Rob got me back as fan. Rob shows his true comdeic genius as Marvin delivering cheap gags which are always good for a laugh."
3,The Animal,"I was very disappointed by this film. I loved ""Duce Biggalo"" and I was looking forward to the same sort of comedy. However, this movie wasn't nearly as funny as I'd hoped. It was riddled with mediocre acting. The acting combined with a poor story made for a rather brain dead movie. The only bright spots in the movie were Guy Torre and an all too brief appearance by Norm MacDonald. I'd watch it if it came on television, but I would not recommend renting or buying this film."
3,this movie was really funny!,this movie was really dumb but it was really funny also.I thought that the previews showed everything. But I was wrong. Ijust couldn't stop laughing. It remindedd me of the first time I saw shrek.
3,Pretty good.,"I bought this movie because I heard that it was a pretty good one. I watched it through for the first time... and it's OK but not as good as Scheider's other movie, Deuce Bigalow. There are a few good laughs as well as a hilarious cameo by Adam Sandler. The story was interesting. I would suggest picking up Scheider's other flick before this one, however."
3,Better than you'd think,"Critics have pretty much universally trashed all movies written by/starring SNL alumni from the early '90s, but 'The Animal' sits up there with 'Billy Madison' and 'Happy Gilmore' as a solidly absurdist comedy. While not a classic, there's enough sustained ""smart"" dumb humor to make it definitely worthwhile. I've seen too many movies that catered towards the Lowest Common Denominator at every turn. While this one was definitely sold as such, it's much more a case of dumb humor for smart people.And that Colleen is too darn cute. Her awkward performance was saved in the editing (watch as no dialogue shots stay on her for too long... if at all), but the camera definitely loves her."
4,The animal reviw,"this is a funny movie that let's you soar through your imagination. the dialog is witty, the charicters are well chosen, and best of all, the stunts and graphics are awesome"
1,43 minutes 21 seconds,"I made the unfortunate error of renting this piece of trash of a movie. I was able to watch exactly 43 minutes and 21 seconds before I had to turn it off--and the only reason I watched that long was because I wanted to see just how stupid it could get. It gets pretty stupid. Everything about this movie is stupid, the plot, the over-'acting', the script, etc...I cannot believe these people allowed their good names to be associated with this film. Here's to hoping to see Rob ""Oscar Bait"" Schneider in a better movie soon!!!PS If you are 8-13, you might find the potty humor in this movie funny."
1,Beads,"The patterns were not well done, you need to really look at the pattern. Of course the book is outdated but the style can be updated by choosing 'newer' style beads and colors."
3,little lukewarm on this one,"I love seeing John McCutcheon perform live, but was a little disappointed with the CD. The songs all seem to sound the same..."
2,I can summarize this book in one sentence.,"""Be the Best at Something"".There you go, that's the whole book.I just saved you a few bucks and a few hours."
4,A good place to start,"The EST model for retail is an over-simplified version of a very big idea - that as a retailer, you have to hold a position in your customers' mind. Being the EST is a very important part of that (This book ignores the equally important aspect of chosing a niche, identifying your target market, etc).I really enjoyed this book. A lot of time is spent building up the concept and helping the retailer understand why EST is so important, which was a bit over-kill for me as I could see the logic immediately, but I think it would be helpful to a lot of people. I do wish more time had been spent on the individual EST's, as I found myself craving a lot more information about the EST that I chose for my store."
3,Nice blanket-Quality is iffy,My daughter loves her blanket and its cute but the first time washed it the pooh became very fuzzy.
4,Sea Lord by Cornwell,"Excellent tale. I hated to put it down, and I was intrigued throughout the book. I've enjoyed all of his sailing novels"
2,"Hooper tries, and fails, to repeat his ""Chainsaw"" success","In ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", Tobe Hooper managed to create a perfect mix of chaos, horror and very dark humour. In this movie he tries to do the same thing, but fails. It has some very chaotic scenes and scenes with dark humour but this movie just isn't shocking in the way that Chainsaw was.Judd is a pretty good character, somewhat similar to the Jim Siedow character in Chainsaw, but most of the things in this movie, including the plot, is not very interesting.This movie can be worth checking out for ""Chainsaw"" fans, but don't expect too much from it. If you're not a fan of ""Chainsaw"" or Tobe Hooper - don't bother."
2,Don't Waste Your Time!,"This review is for the 2-Disc Special Edition of Eaten Alive:Based on what I read about the plot of this movie and the fact that a young Robert Englund acted in this film, I thought Eaten Alive would be worth the purchase, especially seeing how I'm such a fan of the horror genre.Well, once I finished watching it, I was set straight. So allow me to do the same for you: Don't waste your time or your money. It's really that simple.Dark Sky must have had to work extra hard to restore this film and it's still a grainy mess! Grain ran for over 95 percent of the movie, which seem to enhance the atmosphere, but it was way too much. I imagine the original negative was not properly cared for.The croc looked half real and half fake depending on the angle it was shot. The nudity was okay and the idea of using a scythe was kind of original, but the whole damn mess was poorly executed.Stay away. You've been warned."
3,NOT A CLASSIC...BUT NOT HALF BAD!!!,"THIS WAS FAR FROM BEING A MASTERPIECE, HOWEVER FOR A ONE-TIME VIEWING, IT PASSES THE TIME QUITE WELL.IT CAN'T BE TAKEN TOO SERIOUSLY, FROM THE IDIOT CHARACTERS TO THE [VERY BAD]ACTING.THE BUDGET SEEMED TO BE LACKING AND THE CROCODILE SEEMS TO BE MADE OF RUBBER.THE STORY IS QUITE CRAZY, TWISTED, AND DEMENTED, HOWEVER THIS IS A FAR FETCH FROM THE QUALITY OF THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE!!IT HAS A GREAT DEAL OF GORE AND A GREAT AMOUNT OF NUDITY.SO, IF YOU HAVE A LITTLE TIME, SEE THIS MOVIE AND LAUGH A LITTLE.FAR FROM TERRIFYING, BUT FULL OF SICK HUMOR!!!"
1,THIS Flick ...BITES!!!,"I just ""WASTED"" (& U will TOO!) good money, on this BADDD Flick!!! This ONE was left OVER, from the Drive-IN ""Rejects""!!! It's NOT worth a RENTAL???"
4,3 1/2 stars - Especially for fans of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre!,"Eaten Alive is a fun and twisted low-budget horror that fans of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre will enjoy. Three of the original cast and crew take part in this movie, and as you watch, you will often be reminded of TCM. The soundtrack to this film is very similar to TCM, but still original.There is a fair amount of unnecessary dialogue and adding crocidiles to this storyline seems a bit gimmicky, besides, they look really fake. Expect a small amount of really well done gore effects.The story here isn't really about the crocodiles at all, it's about the creepy motel manager. He is really strange, but not nearly as creepy as some of the characters in Texas Chainsaw Massacre.Overall Eaten Alive is a better than average horror flick that verges on being really creepy! 3 1/2 STARS"
4,Welcome to Horror Hotel,"Having done mostly TV prior to Eaten Alive Neville Brand stands out as a psychotic redneck who owns a dilapidated hotel in the backwater swamps of Louisiana. He kills people and feeds their bodies to a large pet crocodile he keeps in the swamp beside his estableshment. Also of note is a very young Robert Englund as Buck the local punk. although not even close to Tobe Hoopers Texas Chainsaw Massacre it does have bad acting, gratuitous nudity, and a splattering of gore to make it viewable as a friday night B-movie. . FYI This is ranked against other B-movies. To rank it against Hollywood blockbusters puts it at about 2 stars."
4,This is Tobe Hooper,"Chainsaw is the perfect horror movie, and although this is no chainsaw, it is definitley the work of the same man. This is about as good a terror film can be without being TCM. The film is never boring, the villian is ultra creepy (think drayton sawyer from TCM running a hotel), and the cinematography is perfect. I'm not exactly sure what everyones problem is with the music, it seems to fit seamlessly. Well I'm sorry folks, I just gotta say i like this one. The gator effects however do leave a little to be desired."
2,"Disappointing, but not terrible","First off, let me warn you: this is nowhere near The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I do have to give the film credit though, as it holds up considerably well, being in the shadow of that master film. It's about a crazed redneck feeding irate motel customers to his pet crocodile (or was it alligator?), and Hooper tries for the ambience of Texas Chainsaw, and it's emotional intensity. As for how well he did, let's just say that you should put Texas Chainsaw completely out of your mind while seeing this, or you'll be very disappointed. But if you like a little backwoods horror, this one's not too bad."
4,The crazy and his crocodile,"And one more Tobe Hooper movie on DVD ! EATEN ALIVE in one of the big horror movies of the end of the seventies. There's an incredible scent of death, madness, blood and fear on each image, even if the movie was shot on studio ! and this DVD is like The Funhouse, a great ""hommage"" to the work of the great Tobe, the Tobe before Poltergeist : widescreen, perfect photography on this support video, ... What else ? See it by yourself : it's wonderful, somewhere !"
5,Croc. near a Cathouse.......................,"Psycho Judd is a man with a pet crocodile. When Judd kills someone he just feed them to his pet. Not Tobe Hooper's TCM. But it still got its creepy touch to it. Even with the crocodile looking fake, still it's a good flick with gore, and nudity. Plus you can't go wrong with a all star cast. Also the special features alone is worth to own. Hooper's interview, and Joe Bell story. The man who may actual feed his victims to a bunch of alligators. I recommend this forgotten horror film to all horror fans."
3,Don't sleep on this-- Fantastic!!,"A lot of people seemed to sleep on this album, but I think it's amazing. It's real funky & cool, and I like the vocals a lot. It's electronica but it's much more deep and soulful than a lot of stuff you hear. It's got a few different flavors on it but there's a thread that runs through it with a real laid-back vibe that I like to groove to. A+++!!"
3,A good Book but not for the casual readers,"This book is heavy stuff. It was written in a style similar to articles published in scientific journals. The opinions and views are drawn based on science and prior studies with thorough references. This book is not for the casual reader who is interested in the topic, but only wants to spend a few hours on it and hopes to walk away with a clearly understanding of the facts or the views of the experts."
4,Enjoyment of old Russian liturgical nusic,The Basso Profundo recording reminds one of the recordings of Tibetan Monks in chant and is very stirring.
2,Unique bass voices,"Given the unique beauty of these gorgeous deep Russian voices, I would have wanted more specifically basso profondo stand-alone pieces on this recording. There are some, but they are interspersed or mingled with rather too many ordinary bass and tenor pieces. The recording quality is fine."
3,"Interesting, fun, informative -- but not that practical","The Nordstrom Way is sort of like two books in one. The first, a business biography, would merit 4 stars; five if expounded upon. The second, however -- and the real intent of this book -- a customer service ""how to,"" is a bit lacking. The reason: Nordstrom's customer service is so over the top that most businesses in most industries would go bankrupt putting its principles into practice. Nordstrom department stores have thrived by servicing a niche market of customers who are willing to pay a premium for truly outstanding service. But that niche is small, and the principles are just inapplicable to most retailers, let alone other business models."
5,Awesome!,Wonderful book! Exactly what I was looking for! Great company to do business with! Very pleased! Will do business with them again in the future!
4,great teambuilder,we purchased this book for everyone in our office - in hopes that each person would gain one tidbit of information to better serve our customers. it sparked a great conversation and opened up several areas that we could improve on. it helped our staff feel like a part of the decision making process because it wasn't us...the owners.... telling them that there was a need for improvement.plus - i keep hearing the staff discuss the book - so i think it was a great activity for everyone to read.
5,Great Story Telling,This was a wonderful tale that I read after the 2001 Movie. I recommend it! Lots of surprising turns.
5,MW's Rave Review,"In The Return of the King, Frodo and Sam continue their perilous journey to destroy the Ring of Power in the fires of Mt. Doom. Throughout the book there are many exciting battles and scenes, and the end of the book is worth reading all of the books just to see how it ends. I have seen and loved the first two movies, and this book is far better than both of those. I strongly recommend reading The Return of the King."
3,Pretty good!!!,Frodo wasn't the only one asleep!! Well written but definitely not half as good as the hobbit one of tolkiens earlier novels.
2,Liked the first one better,I am not a fantasy fan but wanted to read this anyways- It took sometime getting through it. For some reason I liked the first one better
1,The trilogy is all borring,"I have read all three of the trilogy and a great number of other fantasy works. I have no choice but to say that while Tolkien made a indepth backrgound for his story that was all he did. Tolkien built a world, but he never wrote a story. I have never read a fantasy book less entertaining than these. He bores you with the details. Textbooks have fewer appendixes than his books. The only two redeming bits are the symbolism and world building. However, he missed one main concept, its all as borring as can be. Only a few obsessed people out there learn to speak elvish, for the rest of us he could have spent some time on an action scene and just written gibberish because thats all it is. His symbolism is certainly not deep enough to make the books worth reading either. The first and foremost reasons to write any book thats not a textbook is to entertain or make a point. He makes a simplistic point and keeps you saying, 'This sucks!'."
1,The Two Towers,"I would encourage this book for people with high reading ability, to read this book. Two Towers' is a very action packed book with lots of emotion and glory. Before you read this book you should be sure to read the book The Fellowship of The Ring or watch the movie so you can get some background information. I like this book because it shows the friendship of each other and their willingness to stay together. The hardships that they are faced with are very trying and testing of themselves. ""But if we hold true to each other we will do what needs to be done."" This is a quote from the book. The two Towers' is totally a book to read if you are into action and adventure."
5,"The Return of the Kings, the war continues","The Return of the Kings, the third book in the series, is a follow up of The Fellowship of the Ring, and The Two Towers. In this book, Aragorn must reveal his real identity. Legolas deals with his longing to go across the Sea to the Undying Lands, and Frodo must continue his journey to destroy the ring, with Sam's help. All in all, this is a great book"
5,Clayton's Second Review,"This story is aboout a small shire man named frodo with his friends, sam, merry, pippin, legolas, aragorn, and a dwarf named gimli and you cant forget smeagel and Gandolf. These are all the warriors and adventurers in this story. Frodo and the rest of the fellowship try to bring the ring of power to mount doom.so far they have not succeeded but they are close. This is a great stroy to read if you like fantasy and war scenes then this is your book."
5,Timeless,Every time i read this i am amazed. The plot is fast and leaves us wanting more. I will read book three again.
3,The Two Towers It's pretty good!,"J.R.R. Tolkien's The Two Towers brings this fantasy world of the Middle Earth to life, with his vivid description of the land around. Tolkien's epic adventure takes you on the ride right along with the characters. Though at times the tale is tedious, it is as a journey over valleys and mountains would be. If you choose to read this book, I would definitely recommend reading The Fellowship of the Ring first, it being the first book of the trilogy. That would then allow you to understand much more of the story."
4,A Must Read * * * *,"I read this after seeing the movie. There was a lot of action that never made it to the movie. This book is really great, the battle at Helms Deep was a lot different than what they showed in the movie! You have got to read this book, but be prepared it's a long one!"
4,The Best in the series,"J.R.R. Tolkein wrote one of the greatest trilogies of all time called The Lord of the Rings. My favorite book of them all was the second book called The Two Towers. Frodo and Sam have broken away with the fellowship and are heading towards Mt. Doom, the only place where the ring can be destroyed. While Frodo travels to Mt. Doom, Aragon, Gimli and Legolas risk their lives to save their companions who were captured by a group of orcs. Will Frodo succeed in destroying the ring? Or will it fall into the hands of Sauron? Can Aragon save his friends from torture and death? Find out if greed will destroy them all in this great novel."
5,Very good naration,"This was a very good version on tape, i couldn't stop listening to it, i finshed it all in one day."
4,Two Towers,"In the story Lord of the Ring the Two Towers its about the main character Frodo Baggins from the ""Shire"". This story has moral and themes that seem more realistic since the movie came out for it also addresses death, light, purity, hope, and innocence, betrayal, darkness, and redemption. Throughout the book of the Lord of the Ring the Two towers golem is constantly manipulating Frodo's mind into thinking that his friends were against him. This story is a 4 star book because of the way it deals with real life issues, and it also addresses how friendship can come over and triumph over anything because in the story it seem that friendship is the only thing that keeps Frodo pure and uncorrupt in this story friendship, purity, and hope intertwine and overlap into one another. This is why this story derserve a 4 star rating it shows human emotions that can only be brought out through the trial and tribulations of life thorough this story."
5,One book to rule them all...,"I am the ultimate ""The Lord of the Rings"" fan. I LOVE the books. I LOVE the movies. I, erm, LIKE the games. I had seen each of the movies before reading the corresponding novels, and I like the movies in this order (least to greatest):""Fellowship""""Towers""""Return""I like the novels in this order (again, least to greatest):""Return""""Fellowship""""Towers""I loved all three books. They will always be masterpieces. But ""The Two Towers"" stands out as the greatest by far. I admit, the books can get a bit dull, but aside from one or two chapters, ""The Two Towers"" never lets up for a moment. It is much more exciting than most of Professor Tolkien's writing (don't get me wrong, I love everything he's ever written) and there's a lot of emotion. I also thought it was easier to read than all of the others. You mustn't go through your life without reading the trilogy, especially this one. I absolutely loved this book cover to cover and it was EVEN better than the movie."
4,Saving The World,"J.R.R Tolkiens novel The Two Towers is an outstanding book. Being the second part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy it is the heart of the story. The book starts off on the run and stays that way for it's entirity.Tolkien creates a world, Middle Earth, that is so real and so believable, it seems to be an actual place. This makes the book better than most fantasy tales and provides a backdrop which works perfectly for the characters, which are very unique and diverse. The felloship travels in two groups through Middle Earth climbing a seemingly unsurmountable mountain, by fighting a war against evil, but being held together by their friendship and driven by their will to survive with hopes of saving the world."
5,The standard by which all other epics are measured against.,"What is there to say that hasn't been said already? The climax of the ultimate struggle of good vs. evil is, in the words of the of the back cover of the 2Towers ""soul-stirring."" This book moved me in a way that few things ever have before. I first read the book when I was in fifth grade with my father. I really liked it then, but it was not until I re-reread it recently that I realized what a gift Professeur Tolkien has given to the world. I recommend the Lord of the Rings to anyone and everyone. Now if only I could go to Middle Earth . . ."
5,MUST READ,"This book is cool and you should read it. I've read a million books and this series of books is the best. Read Hobbit, Fellowship, 2Towers first, though."
3,"Overall, not bad.",There were rips and tears on many pages and the cover was torn. The content of the book itself is awesome. Fantastic story.
5,someguy,"If you are a boy and you like adventure books, you will love the Lord of the rings the two towers. It is second in a series of three books. Froto Bagins and his friend Samwise Gamgee try to destroy a great ring of power,but danger is waiting for them around every corner.While at the same time Strider,Legolas,and Gimli are having there own adventure. The have to try to save Merry and Pippin who got captured by the orcs. Will Froto and Sam ever destroy the ring, and will Strider,Legolas,and Gimli ever save Pippin and Merry or will they all be destroyed. You will only find out if you read the book."
4,All good things must come to an end,"The conclusion of the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy is an excellent read, and is only the least of the series when compared with the quality of the first two books. By itself, 'The Return of the King' is a tale for the ages. It ties up nearly every loose end. Readers might wonder why the book does not end where it seems like it should. Not to worry, for it continues because there is still one more adventure... one more challenge waiting for the Hobbits when they return home after completing the Quest. Our heroes are forever changed from the individuals they were back when we first met them in 'Fellowship of the Ring,' as are their surroundings. Such is the nature of the Hero's Quest. As with any good fantasy adventure (though 'Lord of the Rings' can be interpreted as a mythology of sorts), all characters within the story earn what they receive, and those that do evil get what they deserve."
4,Unabridged JRR Tolkien!,"This is the only unabridged version of The Two Towers. The reader is pretty good but SLOW!!! You really need to speed him up or just read the book on your own. If you rip this to an m4b and play fast on an iPod, it is good. I just need to find the right Android app to speed up his talking."
4,LOTR 2,The box was squished in the corner but all the CDs are intact.The product looks a little worn but I haven't listened to it yet and I don't see any scratches so I think it should be fine. I'm satisfied.
5,The Greatest Fantasy Epic of All Time! Highly Recommended,"""The Lord of the Rings"" is the sequel to J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy classic,The Hobbit. The Two Towers is the second book (preceeded byThe Fellowship of the Ring: Being the First Part of The Lord of the Ringsand followed byThe Return of the King: Being the Third Part of The Lord of the Rings), but it is actually one epic tale.More adult oriented concepts are included than in The Hobbit, and there are refferences to the pre-history Tolkien was developing and published in various ""Middle Earth"" books, making this a more challenging read (I always have trouble getting through the first part of The Two Towers).This is an epic tale, with many story lines running concurrently. This has it all, Monsters, Wizards, Battles, Treason, Love, Self Sacrifice and much more!Highly recommended!"
5,The Two Towers,"This is the second book of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It really kept me reading. I learned more about Frodo and Same and their quest to destroy the ring. While reading this book I could easily imagine the events. If you enjoyed the first book, The Fellowship of the Ring, you should read this book. There wasn't any part of the book I didn't like."
5,A Masterpiece to Savor,"This is my all time favorite book in the world! This book made me laugh, cry, and really make me think about how amazing the author J.R.R. tolkein is. The stor is a fantasic conclusion to the Lord of the Rings series. The emotion that it has in it is incredible. The plot is amazing with the characters from the past books and some new ones introduced. Tha battles and action are the best and most complete that I have ever read. This book is a must have and the thing is just to hard for me to explain right now. but I can say this. The Lord of the Rings rule!"
2,Confusing,"I think if you are going to write a book about elves, do so. If you are going to write a book about dwarves, do so. But, to write a book about dwarves, elves, farries, gnomes, wizards, and dozens more creatures is a bad move. The language of this book is excellent. It is very discritve and flows wonderfully, but the differences betwen what an elf is, and what a gnome is, is confusing. The plot I think is predictable. The characters seem to make a long journey through a woods, tunnel, mountain and meet another species in every chapter."
1,boring!!!!,most boring book ever better of reading song of ice and fire this book is all bout walkin can't believe its so good chuck away its sux
1,I only put 1 star so people would read this :-),"Tolkien wrote an undescrible book and it cannot be done in any way and i think , that how his son tried to finish the whole series, is bad and he shouldn't have touched it because it's J.R.R.'s not Christopher's and he should have not killed the Dark Lord [Sauron] because evil must stay in the land of Middle-Earth because thats what gave the book meaning"
2,"New, but OLD","The book arrived quickly and it was obvious it was never used. It was also OLD, as the pages are yellowed with age all around the edges. The cover 'cracked' after the first chapter and I'm hoping the book stays intact long enough for my 5th grader to finish it. I did not like that the cover image shown on Amazon (circa 2001 Peter Jackson's movie) was not the version we received. The cover image on our book was a cheesy 70's graphic, which explains why the book is in such brittle condition."
5,It's better to READ the books first before watching the movies...,"Peter Jackson has created an OUTSTANDING masterpiece in it's own right with his interpretation of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy... but Tolkiens books are some of the best literature of the 20th century.Jackson takes several liberties with some key points of the story line, not the least of which is making Frodo a ""Naive Young Hobbit"" when in fact, Frodo and his companions didn't set out on their quest to Rivendell until AFTER his 50th birthday. Little inconsistencies like that between the movies and the books aboud, reason enough to pick up copies of the books to see Tolkiens original narrative."
4,Great book...but I'm glad the movies are out!,"Love this series and love the final book. I just re-read it to prepare myself for the movie. As much as I love the books, I'm so glad Peter Jackson veered from the book and beefed up the roles of Legolas, Gimli, in addition to the battle scenes. Tolkien was one of the greatest creative minds of all time, but he didn't do a good job with the action, nor with Legolas and Gimli. I do love how he wrote Aragorn, Gandalf, Frodo, Samwise and the other hobbits. All in all, a great book and a great series (and an amazing set of movies!). I wish Tolkien were still around to write more adventures. I would have loved to know what happened to some of those guys and gals!!!"
2,"OK, I know this will be an unpopular opinion but.....","To some, Tolkien's greatest stregnth is creating a different world. To me, that is to some extent, his greatest weakness. He seemed to indulge that creativity too much in the third book. I found that the story and character development was greatly hampered by the constant description of locations. I know some love that aspect of the book, but to me, it made it unbearably slow at times. As soon as the action began, Tolkien would launch into detailed descriptions of places and their relation to other places. I could have skipped half this book and not have missed a thing. While I did enjoy the ultimate conclusion and happy ending, as well as the farewell between characters, this book largely could have been subsumed in the maps!"
3,Return of the King review,"The Lord of The Rings: The Return of the KingBy J.R.R. TolkienHarper Collins PublishersCopyright 1955, 1965, 1966Return of The King ReviewThis book starts out with Pippin riding with Gandalf in the realm of Gondor. Then they go to the kingdom of Minas Tirith. There is a lot of talking about pretty much nothing for a while. Then it picks up with Merry while he is in Rohan. Then Merry is made into an advisor to the king of Rohan because he saw how the king's son died and he was one of his friends. Then there is an invasion of Rohan by the Orcs. Then it tells how they ride on the Road of the Dead.I thought this book was alright. To tell the truth this book was kind of slow in the beginning. A lot of it was just talking. But once they finally got to some of the fight scenes it was really good. Over all I thought this book was pretty good mmm'kay. I give it ***1/2 (three and a half stars).By A Gilpin County Sophmore"
2,not very good,"It's a shame to give this book only 1 star, so I gave it 2. There was nothing good about it except that it had a bit less description than The Fellowship of he Ring and it took me less time to finish reading. I think the plot was sort of unclear and it wasn't very interesting. The characters vere very unrealistic and unlikable to me. This book might be good if you're older than I am. (My dad liked it.) It was difficult and boring for me."
5,How could you possibly miss this?,This book is the second part to a fantastic triology. I can't understand how anyone would miss out on story like this!
4,Characteristic of Tolkein,Excellent book. I love the time and thought that Tolkein put into his charcaters.
5,A fitting second part,"In only the form that Tolkien can give, we find that the Fellowship has all but split apart, where frodo and sam head of towards Mordor, while Strider and the others go off to save pippin and merry from a horrible death.The books takes the reader more in depth, emotionally and otherwise, with the main characters. We find that the fellowship has only been split up physically. Everyone is starting to find the strength in themselves to go on and fight for what they believe in even if it spells out their own death.This book is another reason why Tolkien is one of the best writers of his generation. A very moving book."
4,A remarkable end to an amazing trilogy,"LOTR III: The Return of the Kings, like the other works of Tolkien on Middle-Earth, is very time-consuming and yet truly worth your time. If you have the time I would advise you to read this."
5,Best of all!!!!,I would have to say this Lord of the Rings book is the best of all three. It is so well written and the story is just beautiful. This is the one where all of the emotion is put out and you just want to cry in some parts or just become so tense that you feel as if you're in the battle of the Pelennor fields or on the cracks of doom. Pure beauty and a must read for ages to come for all ages.
5,Great book. Don't miss it,"The Two Towers tells two stories. First, it tells of the defeat of Saruman. This is Pippin and Merry's part of the story. With some help from Ents (walking & talking trees), Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, Eomer, Theoden and the newly resurrected Gandalf, the power of the traitor wizard Saruman is broken. In the second half of the novel, Frodo and Sam are lead to Mordor by Gollum. But Gollum, try as he might, cannot overcome the corruption of the ring; and his obsession to repossess it leads to betrayal. Wonderfully poetic, fun at some places, sad and dark in others, this is a novel not to be missed. If you don't have a copy, get one and read it. If you have read it, read it again. It never gets old. It gets better with age."
5,Great,"A great book, and a great copy of a great book. I can't give anymore praise over the book itself that hasn't already been said, so I will limit my review to saying if you are looking for a new digital copy to replace a worn and aged print version as I was this is a very good edition."
4,great book,The boys enjoyed reading the book and it completed our trilogy. The book was in good condition and a great bargain.
5,My son 9 and I loved reading all three books!!,"I had the hard back books which had great maps, but they where old and very musty. I bought the Kindle version and it had maps not as good to read as hardback books foldout maps. It was great to not have to bring the heavy books on our summer trips. I had read the Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings when I was a teenager, I loved them and if possible loved them even more as an adult. My son would jump up and down with excitement as I read. I recommend these books for kids 8 and above and for all adults!"
5,Classic,"The Lord of the rings is a classic that I hold dear to my heart, I loved all the books and the last one I have to say was a triumphant ending. I feel like the original ending was perfect for this story, one that you can't remake."
5,Love the Charnwood edition!,"I'm on the plus side of 50 and I'm finding it more difficult to see the small print in some books. These Charnwood series of books are just what the doctor ordered for me and those like me.I recommend this series to everyone that would like to continue reading after they ""can't see"" any longer,(j/k)."
3,read it,This is number two in an epic that has to be read. Tolkien is one of the best fantasy writers ever
3,Book Review,The Towers is a good book. Frodo and Sam travel closer to Mordor with Gollum as their guide. The rest of the fellowship gets the Ents (trees) to help destroy Isengard and Gandalf come back. I would recommend this book more to adults becaus they talk alot and some parts get boring. But some parts are good and make you keep reading. I recommend this book to 10 year olds and up.
1,American kindle version please,ummm... where is the american kindle version? fellowship and return of the king have kindle versions in the states... please make two towers as well... then i can give you money
4,3/3,"(See my reviews for ""Fellowship"" and ""Two Towers"" also).Return of the King is probably my least favorite of the three. I think that my main problem was that I kept getting confused with all the battle portions. Sometimes, action does not translate well into words, this is one of those times. There's nothing wrong with the book, I just have to work harder to follow this one. I do like the return to the Shire, and I wish that that portion had gone on a bit longer, or that Sam's adventures as mayor would have been written (even as a separate book...not officially part of the trilogy, like ""The Hobbit""), etc."
5,The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,This Book is one of the greatest books ever writen and is over flowing with nonstop action. You must read the first two books in order to enjoy this one. It begains with Gandalf and Pipin going to The White City which is attacked in 5 days from their arrivel. The action does not let up tell the end. And in the end the ring ends up destoying itself.
5,The best in all the world,"The biggest master piece of all times. JRR Tolkien is a genius. Who ever likes good fantasy story telling, most read the works of Tolkien. Most of all The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy and The Hobbit. Ones you start reading this books you never want to stop. If you found Harry Potter wonderful, JRR Tolkiens work will blow you away."
4,Darker First Half Soars,"The journey is now ended. I have finally finished the Lord of the Rings. Savouring the last page of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Return of the King is a bittersweet moment. It is hard to say good-bye to these wonderful characters. The first half of this book was dazzling in its darkness and the entire book was only marred a little by the anticlimatic last hundred pages (excepting the delightful last two chapters set in the Shire, still amounting to four chapters of good-bying.) But that is being too nit-picky for a trilogy that gives such intense pleasure and created such vibrant figures of fantasy. Gandalf and Frodo, particularly, will always live on as they deserve to do."
5,The Great Finale,"I started reading the Lord of the Rings after I saw the movie, and it changed the way I think about books. The plot was wonderful and the language was great. The Return of the King has the best climax ever. It is completely unexpected. The characters and places are described so well. If you haven't read this book or the other Lord of the Rings, READ THEM!"
5,PERFECT,"PERFECT CONDITION. NO water marks, writing in it, bend pages, torn cover, broken spine, AT ALL. It was absolutely untouched and brand new when it got to me. Very, very good deal."
5,THE BEST BOOK!!!!!!,"Return of the King is a great book. The book is adult literature so it may take you awhile to read. The characters in this book learn to work together, no matter what they are. No matter if the are Elf, Man, Dwarf, or Hobbit, they learn to cooperate with each other and even become friends. This book is sad and romantic. The also is gory because there is a lot of battle scenes, so if you do not like fighting then do not read this book or any of the other Lord of the Rings books. Even though, in my opinion, Return of the King is the best book of the Lord of the Rings series, I strongly recommend that you read the first two books, The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers. Then read Return of the King."
4,Two books down and still going strong,"I had to read The Fellowship of the Ring for my sophomore English class, and once I finished it, I was so hyped up on LOTR that I decided to read The Two Towers just for fun. It's a pretty good book--a nice continuation of the Fellowship's story. If you survived the endless pages and detail of the first book, you can survive this one too. It's long, but it's good. And don't forget to see the movie--it provides a nice visual image to all the action."
4,Fine Finish To A Great Trilogy,"Anyone who has read the first two in this classic trilogy, or who wants to get a jump on the movie release will want to read this. While Frodo and Sam move closer to destroying the ring, fierce battles wage between forces of good and evil with Aragon leading the victors. After finishing the book, the thing that struck me was the amount of current authors whose own work resembles Tolkein's. The most prevalent in my mind is Robert Jordan, but also admittedly Stephen King's ""Dark Tower"" series."
4,"The Two Towers, March 7, 2002","The book was great! I found the book very entertaining and would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes to read fantasy. The book is told in the third person showing all the events of Frodo and Sam, Merry and Pippin, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, which made the book fun and captivating. However, I did become bored with many of Tolkien's unnecessary descriptions that I found too lengthy and often too detailed. Still, the book kept me interested to the very end. If you enjoy books that have both humor and sorrow, then you will love this book and for that matter the whole series.(The Fellowship, The Two Towers and Return of the King)."
3,The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,"Merry and Pippin have been captured by orcs and Aragorn, Gimili, and Legalos are out to save them. When the reach the Fangorn forest they meet an old friend who takes them to the king of Rohan. There they volunteer to fight in the battle at Helms Deep. Meanwhile Frodo and Sam Continue their quest to destroy the ring. On the way they meet Golum who then becomes their guide. He shows them the way into Mordor but will he stay loyal to them or try to steal the ring?I thought this book was good but it could have been a little more interesting. It also could have been shorter. Overall it was a good story with lots of action."
5,caleb's review,"Aragorn, Gimili, and Legolasgo to find the dead king and his army so they can win the battle between gondor and mordor. Frodo gets stabbed by a giant spider named shelob and sam, frodos best friend, has to save him. then orcs take frodo and sam saves him again. At first gondor is losing the battle then rohon comes and they start winning then more of mordor comes and they are almost defeated when Aragorn, Gimili, and Legolas come with the dead king and his army and they win the battle. after that aewen kills the nasgul king, a human king that Saraun turns evil sence no man can kill him. then gondor goes to mordor and tries to take out the army and almost gets destroyed when Frodo destroys the ring and the dark lord and his army is killed."
4,Very good,"i didn't read the Two Towers until last month I thought it would be great, which is it is. It's a fun and exciting book that will entertain anyone who reads it. But it lacks something that the movies really did a good job in. the movies went into more depth and details of the characters. Which isn't something you expect a movie to do. But the book left me hangin' on some of the charcters. The only character that truly gets your attention every time he appears is Gandalf. My reccomdations: don't read this book if you have high expectations from the movie. I'm not discouraging you from reading it but I'm just warning you. It's an intruiging book that will captivate you until the very end. Enjoy!"
5,The Return of the King; A Work of Literature,"The Return of the King is an exciting, fast paced, novel. The novel is about the a man named Aragorn and how he is the riteful heir to the throne of a mighty kingdom, and a hobbit, or halfling, who is on a quest to destroy the One Ring of Power. A dark lord named Sauron aimes to destroy all of human kind and rule Middle-earth. He forged the One Ring of Power, and with it his disires can be filled. The race of mankind fights to destroy it, while Sauron's army of orcs, evil creatures born out of the ground; Nazgul, kings of old who were decived; and evil men; fight to recover the One Ring of Power.The Return of the King is a real page turner. J.R.R. Tolkien, the author, has created an entire world, and history in order to write this book. Not only did Tolkien write all three of the books in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but also a 100+ page appendix. I think this is a wonderful book."
4,The One with No Beginning and No Ending,"The hardest part of being in the middle of a trilogy is its has no beginning and no ending. But was that a problem when you have the first and the third at hand?Really its not a matter for me as a reader even the writer JRR Tolkein at one time in his life writing this book feel tired and hopeless.The complexity of this novel is very clear in this second installment. The characters are not confused anymore and the journey is somehow sickening in somepart ( Frodo and Sam with ashes and irritatingly routine meals, lembas) and interesting in the others (Helm's Deep and Sam as a hero)."
5,Great and deservedly acclaimed,"I guess the release of the movie will stimulate interest in the book. So I'm writing this for those who know the film but not the book. There are some minor differences in plot, inevitably, but both Tolkien's Trilogy and the Peter Jackson movie trilogy are great. I REALLY great. After vast battles and perils the forces of good previal, and Middle-Earth is saved, but at a cost. Tolkien unfortunately, I think, cut the final chapter from this, which provides a satisfactorily epilogue. It can, however, be found in his collected work elsewhere. The book also contains valuable appendices, chronologies, notes on the languages of middle-earth, etc. It's hard to say more about something so well-known, but if you loved the film you ought to love the book, too. Incidentally, Hal GP Colebatch's book 'Return of the Heroes"", which I have reviewed on its own page, gives an interesting and insightful socio-political analysis all Tolkienties should enjoy."
4,It's great,It's great. I like all the books. It's on my kindle so I can read them anywhere. A good read
5,Masterpiece!,"J.R.R. Tolkien stands out among fantasy writers as few others do. Almost equal to C.S. Lewis (The Chronicles Of Narnia), and inferior only to Lewis Carroll, he has created a true masterpiece in The Lord Of The Rings trilogy. In fact, each book flows into the other so well that you don't really feel as if you've read a trilogy; you feel as if you've read a very long book with three excellent chapters. And as long as it is, when it ends, you wish it weren't over."
2,"sorry Latinosoulboy ,U GOT IT WRONG",this is whats wrong with most of the smooth jazz genre.lame mechanical tracks thrown over a bed of programmed drums.Its time to get REAL and play it that way!!!!!!
2,Didn't Really Impress Me To Much,Other than the cover of Aretha's Daydreamin there's nothing to love about this disc.
3,Ribbon Embroidery for Crazy Quilts,This book is for those who have a working knowledge of embroidery and can work from simple diagrams. It is not for the beginner who wants to learn ribbon embroidery. It has many ideas for embellishing Crazy Quilts. It is in black and white diagrams other than a coloured cover.
1,crummy crummy crummy,this is the worst movie i have ever seen! i turned it off it was so bad! i got it at wal-mart in like their $3 bin or something... they should have paid ME to get it!
1,One of the worst movies I have ever seen.,"I like Sandler.I couldn't even finish watching it. I purchased it, and actually took it out of the DVD player and broke it in half.The general public should be able to sue the actors and distributors when stuff like this is foisted upon us.Truly horrible, not funny, taped together. They must have spent fifteen bucks filming this abortion."
1,Ouch This Movie Hurts,I had to write this review to counterbalance all the faked 5 star reviews. I picked this up for a buck thinking it would be worth seeing Adam Sandler's first feature film. The only part that made it worthwhile was seeing the happy Madison guys so young. Sandler does a decent job and you can see how his career got launched. Outside of that this movie is a train wreck. The plot is a waste of time. The acting is over the top and hammy. On of the most egregious parts is the sound. The only way people might like this is in its so bad its a cult classic thing. Beware the casual movie goer won't be swayed by girls in bikinis.
3,Adam is always a hottie... even if the movie isnt,"My roommate bought this movie for me since she knows I love Adam Sandler. We watched it one night and thought it was sort of silly. HOWEVER... at the beginning, Adam does say it isn't a 'low-budget film', it's a 'no-budget film'. You are forewarned. It didn't have much of a plot, but Adam was a terrific actor even then. I love him. Billy Zane even made a cameo appearance as King Neptune. I would give it a try."
3,Pretty good for a first movie,I thought this movie was funny in a silly and totally Adam Sandler kind of way. I think it is definitely worth the money for a true Sandler fan. :-)
3,An interesting effort...,ok... it's true...if you go into this movie expecting anything spectacular... than you will be dissapointed... but it was very clear that they weren't making it to be a great movie... it had it's entertaining moments... one liners... covers by Sandler... an interesting parody-type metal band frontman... the best part about this movie... is that you can actually see where the talent started out... it's actually cool to see how Sandler evolved... and the acting in the movie was surprisingly great... I'm surprised I haven't seen more of the actors in other movies... bottom line... it's pretty good for a bad movie... I paid six bucks for it... I spend more than that on Dr Pepper in a day...
1,Join the Club,"This is not just the worst Adam Sandler movie. It is the worst movie of all time. In highschool me and some friends saw this at the store. We rented and watched it. We were mortified that they had actually made this movie. We then decided we were going to make a club. The only way you could get in was watch this movie. That is if you did not kill your self while watching and/or thinking about this film . Awful, awful, awful."
4,awesomely bad,This movie is so bad it is awesome. Obviously a lot of people on here do not have a sense of humor. I laughed all throughout the move. How could someone not think that this is funny? If you have a boring sense of humor do not watch this but if you actually have half of a sense of humor it is funny to watch just how bad this movie is. Awesome.
1,The Greatest Movie Ever,"My goodness, this movie is pure gold. I mean the character and plot development almost enticed me to watch past the first 30 minutes, unfortunately a voice deep within my soul beckened me to gouge the eyes out of my head with a rusty screwdriver rendering me blind and unable to see the film's ultimate climax."
1,"CRAP MOVIE, BUT ADAM SURE CAN SING.","This film is insane. Plot, what plot. The plot is total crap. This film is the worst film I ever saw in my life and that is saying something.The only good thing in this movie is to hear Adam singing.I cant believe how Adam became a such a big star ather this movie. This movie should have killed his acting career. This show us how much of a talented actor is Adam to go on to have a very big acting career and became a very big star in hollywood ather this movie. If any other less talented actor had been the main star in that film, that person acting career would have been over.That how bad this movie is. If you dont dont believe me, check out your self.I bet Adam is looking back on this film and saying, ""what was I thinking of staring in that film. O well actor has to start somewhere""."
2,Not what you'd expect from Adam Sandler AT ALL,"I bought this movie thinking it would be funny considering Adam Sandler stars in it but it was a very low budget movie with HORRIBLE female acting and no nudity at all. I wouldnt say its the worst movie cuz it has its moments. I couldnt believe Adam hardley said one funny thing, alot of things he said I think were supposed to be funny but werent and whenever he tells a joke its a piece of s**t like ""why did the chicken cross the road?"". So I really wouldnt recomend this to anyone."
5,New Masterpiece,"I've been waiting for this for years. In fact, I went on an MPR Prairie Home forum and suggested it a couple of years ago. Robin and Linda's wonderful musicianship, and that of their supporting cast, has produced an album that will be treasured by anyone who buys it."
1,I had no other choice but to read this book.,"This is the only book that I had to read on my flight to Florida. I was trapped! I did not like or sympathize with any of the characters. Wait, yes I did, the dog. He was the only one who was real. Self centered garbage."
2,Predictable,"Something drew me to this book in the store (probably the cover). It started off okay but then got very predictable. On the back cover, it mentions that one of foursome has a ""daughter and a dog"". It was a son, not a daughter. I really hate mistakes like that. I wouldn't recommend it."
1,In a perfect world this book would never have been written,"This book starts out quite well but once the adulterous spouses die in the plane crash the novel also takes a downward plunge. The behaviour of the surviving partners is quite impossible to credit, their motivations hard to comprehend and the romance between is unbelievably cliched and in bad taste.I somehow can't imagine that this mishmash can be made into a successful film so I think I'll give it a miss."
1,A truly awful book,"It is the reader's misfortunate that all of the characters do not die in the plane crash that occurs at the beginning of the book. Pass this book up and read instead ""The Pilot's Wife"" by Anita Sheve."
5,WORTH EVERY PENNY.,"Simply beautiful, brilliant music. If the idea of spending 40 or 50 dollars for this set puts you off, please don't let it. The more Jobim, the better, and the 3 CDs is nowhere near exhausting or overkill. Even the last CD, which has multiple versions of his most famous songs, is varied enough that you don't even notice. If you've never owned a Jobim record or even if you've only heard of him, this is really the very best way to start, even better than just a single Lp. After getting this, you'll only want more; as well as more music from Stan Getz, Joao Gilberto, Astrud Gilberto and Elis Regenta as well."
5,A great deal for such great music,"Bossa nova is probably one of the most amazing musical genres out there. It is timeless and priceless (so don't care about the big price tag on this cd) because it will continue to give you more and more pleasure. This 3 disc ""book"" set serves up quite a nice portion of classic Jobim songs sung by himself along with his collaborators such as Joao Gilberto, Astrud Gilberto, and Elis Regina and Stan Getz on sax. Disc 1 is probably the most listenable in one sitting since there are 23 different beautiful songs. Disc 2 is good to put on when you're doing some cleaning. Disc 3 is great because you get to see how different singers add different elements to the same song. Whether you're a new or old fan of bossa nova, you need to add this to your collection."
5,"Love,Laughter,and Life. Jobim","From Frank Sinatra to Sting, all of us that have expierenced Jobim's work praise him as one of the most gifted composers of our time. His musical talents are to be studied and admired. His lyrics are poetry. It's a divine mix of music and emotion like nothing you've ever heard before. And even if you've never heard of Jobim, you have heard his music. If you've ever been in love, Jobim has written a song for you. Sinatra and Sting are only two of the many that have felt an urge to interpret Jobim's work. And I won't give it away, but their is a track not listed on this CD set that will take you to a historical and intimitt moment in time, that will make want to embrace the composer, and from the heavens he will be there with you. Enjoy !"
4,I couldn't put it down but I don't know why,"I just finished my second reading of Enchanters. Between them I read Sorceress. It is in many ways the same book. The cast is wandering around trying to get to the right place at the right time to do the right thing. The pleasure is in the journey, the little and apparently purposeless events which are fun to read about. Enchanters, unlike Sorceress, actually has a major event at the end, followed by everyone getting married like a Shakepearean comedy. What I'm saying is that I find Eddings like Wolfe. I just pick up the books and read them without worrying about the plot."
5,excellant!,i loved the whole series. escpecially this book. I look forward to starting the next 7 books in the Mallorean series; Belgareth the Sorceror; and Polgara the Soceress!
5,Best Fantasy series you'll ever lay your hands on,"Great book, Great Ending Great series! This is one of the best books ive ever come across and i'm no Fantasy fanatic. A must read for everyone who thinks that fantasy is boring!"
5,Awesome,"I've read all of the books related to this saga, and I own Belgarath the Sorcerer. To the people who say it is a typical story, KEEP READING! It only gets better. If you want something more complicated and you want a backround on the story, read BELGARTH. Or Polgara the Sorceress. Happy reading!"
4,A satisfying ending to a good series,"In Enchanter's Endgame David Eddings draws the Belgariad to a much anticipated conclusion. As the armies of the West invade Mishrak ac Thull to stave off two huge armies of Angaraks, Garion, Belgarath, and Silk jounrney to the heart of Torak's dominions, Cthol Mishrak, City of Darkness. Both the allied armies and Garion's small company will face challenges and a few suprises that the sleeping God Torak has up his sleeve.Edding's stories are nothing terribly new, but they are fun and witty. This book especially showcased Eddings ability to weave some really fun characters into a familiar fantasy setting while not being cliche. Enjoy!"
1,*sigh*,"Just another example of why fantasy is considered pulp, and suitable only for 11 year old social outcasts. I read this when I was twelve and found it to be childishly written and poorly conceptualized, with paper-thin trite characters to boot. Oh well. If you read this series, and still want to give fantasy a try, read ""Memory Sorrow and Thorn"" by tad williams. It is everything these books are not."
5,Tis one of the greates books of fantasy I have read !,"This series of books one of many by David Eddings and as always he captured everything a Fantasy Book needs . Action,suspense ,and intrigue ,the first book Pawn of Prophecy caught my eye and I read it ,great series beginner, but more and more the rest of the series got better and better as I read on but here in the last book of the Belgaried, ,Enchanter's end Game was the greatest, where everything came down to the ending of who will win. Great book and my suggestion tis you read the series and see for yourself . WaylanderX"
2,Not Free SF Reader,"What's love got to do with turning to the dark side, anyway?Even the god Torak thinks Polgara is a babe it seems, trying to convince her and wizard boy that his ideas are pretty cool.Needless to say, they disagree, and the heart of the matter will be a giant-sized magic sword fight between Belgarion, our hero, and the dark lord.Or, this is the end of an archetypal completely light, fluffy, devoid of consequence and disposable fantasy series for younger readers where the major characters are generally clearly stamped with 'not going to be hurt' markers, and all will be good in the end."
1,Probably as low and ridiculous as it gets.,"This entire series is just a bunch of clichés gathered in one place. Some village-idiot grows up to become king over half the world and gets a magic sword (pulled from a wall--hmm..rings any bells? [The Arthur legend]) then he sets off on some silly quest to rid the world of all evil. I read these books (and the following series ""The Malloreon) when I was 12 years old. That is probably the upper limit if you want to enjoy them. Eddings couldn't come up with an interesting story if his life depended on it. The main character (Belgarion) jumps around with a big silly sword killing bad-guys to the left and the right, but in 10 (!) books he doesn't get hit once!! Silly or what?My advice is to start reading some real fantasy like Tolkien or Robert Jordan."
2,Superficial and non-comprehensive book,"Having read this book two thoughts come up:1. They should have had much more in-depth data, why stick so much to the surface ?2. Is their overview of ways to deal with radical innovation comprehensive ?Seen the impressive list of authors and the impressive research they've done the book is disappointing. Maybe because they were limited on what they could disclose, time pressure etc.To learn more about dealing with radical innovation I recommend the books 'Corporate Venturing, 'Intrapreneuring', 'Webs of Innovation', 'The Innovators Dilemma'.So should you read 'Radical Innovation ? Well if you're active in the field it should be on your shelves, otherwise I wouldn't spend my dollars on it."
2,Not the Smithereen's best effort....,"I must say that I was disappointed with this CD...I really was expecting much more. Too many mid tempo songs that tended to sound alike and just didn't seem to go anywhere. Carrie Akre's guest vocal on ""House At The End Of The World"" was a real treat though. Not a terrible recording, but definitely not up to the standard set with ""Green Thoughts."""
3,Starting to wear thin,"Blood And Roses, Cut Flowers, Flowers In The Blood.Groovy Tuesday, Gloomy Sunday.House We Used To Live In, House At The End Of The World.In A Lonely Place, The Long Loneliness.Anyone smell a formula developing here? This effort sounds like so many of their other efforts...but not quite as exciting. Perhaps the reason is that there is too much of a feeling that we've been here before. Nothing new. (At least there are no songs with the word ""blue"" in the title.)This is not a bad album, but just doesn't do anything that they haven't done before, and the tunes just are not on the same level as earlier work."
1,"To Pat, Jim, Mike, and Dennis: Give it up or move along NOW!","Great, two Smithereens albums I already have and a handful of demos that don't justify buying the whole she-bang a second time. The Smithereens were one of the first ""college rock"" groups I really liked because they didn't sound like the usual dreck eMpTy V played, but between this and the second best-of, the band's becoming as unattainable when it comes to new material as the girls Pat DiNizio used to sing about. Is it writer's block? Is it lack of interest on the band's part? Learn from the mistakes of George Lucas, boys. You sang it yoruselves on the Timecop soundtrack, ""Time won't let me wait that long.""And to the buyer, unless you're a pair of Nikes shy of Heaven's Gate when it comes to the Smithereens. You already have these so go spend your money on something/someone else.Signed,epsteinsmutha"
4,Very enjoyable,"A very enjoyable compilation of Pulp hits. Good for Pulp fans, Britpop fans, and for people who want to get to know the band."
3,"Ex-Spandau Ballet, now actor...","Gary and his brother Martin formed Spandau Ballet in 1979, and were really the only two to succeed from there on (check out Wikipedia for great detail on the highs and lows of the other 3 artists.) This solo album was released in 1996 by Gary, who also acted in the movie 'The Bodyguard' with Kevin Costner, in the role of the ever-so-slightly slimey publicist, Sy. If only he had Tony Hadley's (SB's lead singer's) voice..."
4,Must Read for New Thought Philosophy,"This is a must read for anyone who is interested in the 'New Thought' philosophy.Thomas Troward writes and explains everything so elegantly. I love reading anything that has to do with him.The only problem I ever have with writings of T. Troward is that sometimes he speaks a little too intellectually. He also sometimes refers to things that are a bit dated, and that can also make it difficult to follow along at times.There is nothing else out there for learning how to use your thoughts to control your life, like the teachings of Thomas Troward. If that is an area of study that interests you, then read anything of his you can get your hands on."
5,Powerful Truths,"The Law of Attraction isn't a new thought - Thomas Troward was teaching it in the early twentieth century. And he taught it well. Trowards books are very rewarding, and studying them will be a huge benefit to anyone who wants to learn more about the Laws of the Universe and how to apply them in order to change their lives."
4,good book,"I found this book in one of those factory second tables at the shopping centre, I thought it was a novel Roseanne had written, some cheesy romance thing but because I am such a huge fan I bought it anyway, God I loved it, So brutally honest and self examining, I loved the people she loved and hated those she hated.Great bio, the best I ever read."
2,"Be Wary, All Ye Who. . . .","Just wanted to let you know, this edition is abridged. So ""Most Awesome"" control yourself. I was familiar with the Early English Text Society edition. I will be honest, I did not read all of it, but some. And I became suspicious when I saw the number of pages. The EETS edition is two volumes. And although it contains some editorial mumbo-jumbo, it is certainly a beautiful edition. And the prose Merlin text alone is, just at, 700 pages. I would say a great deal is left out, nearly half. So be wary, if you do not mind - enjoy!!!!!"
1,What a disappointment!,"I called Billy Blanks company to ask what is his most difficult cardio that I can buy. I explained to them that I am not new to fitness and work out for years. I was told that I need to buy the Elite series Fat Blasting Cardio; I bought it.What a disappointment!It is not a hard workout or a good workout for that matter. Workout itself does not have a structure. There is no proper warm up before stretching. It is not challenging, boring and not satisfying. There is no rhythm to each set's length. I will not use it again.I have Billy Blanks' old abs workout tape. It is much better and I still use it."
4,An Enchantment for the Few,"The Image was one of the first erotic novels I read, and it left a greater impression on me than even Story of O. It can be repellent, but how deliciously repellent. It is vivid, and how powerfully so. It is small and slight, as it should be. It is like a little album of photographs that we carry around for a lifetime. The images created by this book are strong, rich and lasting. The battle of wits between little Anne, her mistress and the male observer is never really won, but played out exquisitely to a climax that is neither satisfying nor predictable. The cruelty is tender, the flesh is vulnerable and the object of desire is as ambiguous as our reaction. We can only wish for a relationship that permeates the senses like the one in The Image."
3,TEXTURE,Totally love this product it was everything I expected. The quality is gr8 and it arrived on time. I would definitely recommend this product.
4,random and eclectic beats,"Farmin' for Beatz exhibits a range of sounds from the up and coming producer in the electronic music scene, Woogie. His eccentric flare leads to a diverse selection of sound and rhythm. This fact is completely exemplified in tracks like ""Painting a Rhythm"" and ""A Beat Can Be Anything"". This album divulges his ability create several different moods within one track, yet maintains the continuous flow of the song. Guests like Craig G and Allison add flavor to the syncopated and groovy beats. Overall, this album is reminiscent of the classic Liquid Sky Crew compilations in that it pushes the boundaries of drum and bass music. For the ""real"" music lover who doesn't like to be pigeon holed, Farmin' for Beatz is the ideal album."
3,Steele's Retreat,"A fairly interesting but very limited in scope study of a minor campaign in the West in 1864.Only the events surrounding Steele's retreat (several small battles) are covered in this text, without context. They are given close attention and clear analysis, with the exception that clearer maps/graphics would have been a plus. This campaign is interesting in that both sides accused the other of killing wounded men, mutilating the dead and other atrocities, accusations which the author reports but does not explore."
3,Big on paper short on Gold !,"The book was informative in many ways especially in the history of the FED and some of the key historic and contemporary figures. The chapters on FED ""Speak"" and on whats going on up to 2003 in the US Economy were well done. My big disappointment is with the fact that the authors never mentioned the very historic and monumental event of taking our currency off of the Gold Standard. This one decision alone is a very big part of why we have so many ongoing problems in our economy that need so called ""Fixing"" by the Fed.There was mention of Richard Nixon and the Fed Chairman at the time Nixon was in office which is when they made the big decision to dump the gold standard but yet the authors never mention it at all. I can't believe they left this important event out of the book by accident.I'd like to have an explanation from the authors concerning this gross negligence."
3,A bit outdated but still a good primer,It was written in 2002 so it does not cover what has happened since '07 . Use it as a basis for further study.
2,A Religious Dream Dictionary,"As mentioned in the publisher's note, Miller wrote this book in the first decade of the twentieth century. It is based on religion rather than psychology, with attention paid to The Bible and the role dreams played throughout.The author posits that a dream is a vision of the future, and that any relationship with the past or present is incidental.From a religious perspective, I question the authority and validity of the author's interpretations.Scientifically speaking, the work has very little to offer aside from an alternative/historic view (which is not without value).Now that dream psychology is mainstream, and religious dream interpretation is on the fringe, this book's title is misrepresentative. A more fitting title might be ""A Religious Dream Dictionary: 10,000 Dreams Interpreted."""
1,Don't waste your time or money,"I got this book as a gift and still think it was a waste of money. Every dream I have looked up so far was negative, most dealing w/ some future pending event, ie if you dream 'X' you are soon to lose your job or some other misfortune. How a dream relates to some future event in the physical world I'll never know. I was hoping it would deal more w/ what's going on in my subconscious, but that doesn't seem to be what this book is about."
1,Definitely Not What I Expected,"I have to agree with several of the other readers who gave this book a bad review. I bought this book thinking that it would be informative and realized after looking over the entire book that it was very grim and negative. Every time I would look up a dream it would be interpreted with doom and dispair, hardly any of the dreams have a positive outlook. Don't waste your money."

5,THE BEST BOOK EVER!!,I think this book is very imaginative and fun to read. In the first part where she's in Wonderland she goes through a world of nonsense and is trying to find a way out. In Through the Looking Glass she goes through a mirror into a backwards world. I would encourage anyone to read this book because it encourages people to use their imagination and to learn that stuff happens you just have to find the correct way to deal with it.My favorite character was the Duchess in the first part because she was very annoying and didn't even know it also she has a very comical cook who's obsessed with pepper. My favorite part of the book was when Alice met the Mad Hatter and the March Hare at their tea party.
1,Kindle Edition Not As Described,"The Kindle combined edition of Alice['s Adventures] in Wonderland & Through the Looking Glass described here [ http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011U42V6/ref=yml_dp ] has neither the Tenniel illustrations nor the annotations mentioned in the description. As you can get the books for your Kindle for free, it's not worth getting the combo - even for 99 cents - without these features. That seems rather the point of purchasing it. (It was for me, anyway.)"
4,Alice's Adventures,"The book arrived as promised. I was surprised how short the stories were, having chosen to read this book after reading the Twilight series. I haven't read the added features, just the Advenures and Looking-Glass stories, so I cannot comment on their content. The illustrations were very nice. My only complaint was that the printed text was poorly spaced on the page, the inner edges being close to the center of the book, making it somewhat uncomfortable to read."
2,this edition was NOT what I expected,"Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Alice in Wonderland, and have from childhood. Rereading it made me more aware of the intoxicating dreamlike quality of the story line as well as the incredibly tongue-in-cheek writing style. BUT... I was very disappointed to open it and find it contained NO illustrations whatsoever! Reading A.I.W. without the John Tenniel drawings is like eating plain dry bread. I know the drawings by heart so I could imagine them, but it isn't the same. Also -- many many typos! Avoid this edition! I'm going to order a different one right now."
4,Great collection for a good price,"I love the Alice books, but this was the first time I read all of them. I paid full price at a retail store and I felt it was a fair price because it is the whole collection. The book is a great cloth bound hardcover. Honestly, the only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because the pink flamingo's paint faded off when I touched it and that bothered me because I like to keep my books in pristine condition. Especially if I have only read them once. However, it was a great buy."
5,"In this case, you CAN judge a book by it's cover!","Obviously Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass are 2 literary classics, so I'm not reviewing those...But this particular book has put EVERYTHING having to do with Alice and her adventures under 1 cover. Not only do you get both the beloved stories, you also get the ORIGINAL ""Alice's Adventures Underground"" which Alice in Wonderland was based on. It is also notated throughout the book, with the explanations of each notation categorized in the back by Book:Chapter:Notation #.The thing that, for me, makes this particular pressing stand out, is not just that everything is all neatly bound together, but I absolutely ADORE the stylish new COVER! In fact, I love ALL the new Penguin Classics series of re-bound classic novels."
4,Good Bedtime Story,"This is a fun read you can see where they get the ideas for all the movies from. Which for me makes the movies better. I like both books Alice's adventures in wonderland as well as Through the looking glass, the only thing I wondered is why, if all the movies are based on through the looking glass, does Alice always fall down the rabbit hole? I loved how she got into the looking glass world and I think that would make a great story too!!! The only question that remains is why is a raven like a writing desk????"
4,Don't believe in impossible things? Try doing it a couple times a day.,"A very cute and very fun read, even over 100 years later. The word play and sheer ridiculousness of the characters that interact with Alice always makes this book lively and interesting. And yet, for a book that bills itself as a children's novel, I would find it hard to believe that adults who have never read it before couldn't enjoy it in their old age. No matter what age you are, though, you owe it to yourself to read this book."
5,Excellent edition of a known classic!,Cohen's introduction provided interesting insight into the life of Charles Dodgeson and the history that surrounds the creation of these 2 books. I love that all the original artwork is contained in this affordable little paperback as well. A must-have for every personal library.
3,Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass,"Personally, I was disappointed with these books. They scared me a little, but that was mostly the pictures. I also was not super impressed with the writing. It dragged a lot and made me fall asleep during our Sustained Silent Reading periods (SSR). I really do think that the movie is better because I think it isn't as scary and is funnier. I did think that these books would have been good for their time period, but I just don't think that they appeal to kids now."
4,A masterpiece.,"Alice's Adventure's in Wonderland tells you the story of Alice a young 7 year old girl. Alice has quite an imagination, infact it's her imagination that creates the mad world of Wonderland. It is completely weird, funny, and entertaining. Alice meets with many classic ""mad"" characters, such as the Cheshire Cat, and the mad hatter. this isn't only for children, it is for anybody. it has such a strange story and strange characters it makes Star trek look like Full House(just kidding). This is kind of freaky at some poinys seriously.This also comes with through the Looking Glass(the reason why I took out a star). That was really Dodgsons cry ofr money. (Dodgson was reall lewis Carrols last name. his full name is Charles Dodgson). I would give ""Through the Looking Glass"" a 3 out of 5 because it asn't realy as good as the original. The Story of the second one was very thin and stupid...I would reccomend this.~Dan~~~~~~~~~~"
3,world of wonders,"The book I read was Alice In Wonderland.The book was about a girl named Alice who had a lot of wonders.Then she went a long,exciting adventurein a world of wonders.She met and saw a lot of interesting things on her journey.I would only recommend this book only to little kids or to people who like fantasy boooks.If you are the ages between one and ten you should read this book.If you are older,this is really not a good book to read."
5,Greatest text of 19th century?,"Possibly. Chalkful of vivid images, philosophy, language, and satire, Carroll makes one want to give up hopes of writing anything that might be labeled ""literature."" Highly recommended. The pictures are pretty as well :)"
1,Not a good Kindle edition,"Unfortunately, this Kindle version is missing almost all of the illustrations, which are an integral part of the book. And the poetry is not formatted correctly and is in red on my iPad Kindle.Through the Looking Glass [Kindle Edition] by BLTC is the one you want."
1,It's missing a line!,"This edition is missing a line! Look on page 37, in the ""Fury said to a mouse"" poem. It says ""I'll be jury"" when the real line is supposed to be ""I'll be judge, I'll be jury""! What other mistakes have they made?"
4,Carroll weaved in some of his own feelings...,"Lewis Carroll managed to get in his own two cents in this book. He wrote this book for his niece (?) but he still weaved in some of his own political beliefs. Carroll was known to do that and did in Alice and Wonderland, yes it's weird, yes it may be called a children's story but I still think it should be read by child and adult alike."
4,Alice in Wonderlandwith color photos from Hallmark TV movie,"Alice in Wonderland with color photos from Hallmark TV movie, and also color photos from it on the dust jacket."
5,A Mind Opener,"I think Alice in Wonderland is the best book I ever read.It realy makes you think.It kind of makes you think of what you would do if you were Alice,And wonder what will happen next.I think it's the neateds of things about falling down rabbit holes,changing sizes,and more.If I got to chose on any book in the world it would be my all time favorit""Alice in Wonderland""."
2,bad layout,the layout on my kindle with the poems is dreadfull and not what i expect for a book i have purchased i will download free versions in the future
3,=\,"I was very pleased with this book, it's an all time favorite. However, i was very disappointed that despite the description there were no illustrations what so ever."
3,aesthetics,"I selected this particular copy of Alice in Wonderland because of the pretty cover and (I assumed) binding. However, when the product arrived it was much smaller/flimsier/less impressive than I was expecting and the binding is plain white! Not even a title! I'm going to have to find another way to display the book to show off the interesting cover but this was still quite annoying. Aside from that it seems as if the book was poorly produced. It still looks new but there's something lacking in the craftsmanship"
3,No pictures.,I read and loved Alice as a child. I was disappointed with the version I received because none of the pictures of the characters were in this book. The pictures in the original were a large part of the charm of the book.
1,"No index, can't search!","I bought this edition because I was so horribly disappointed with the free version, which had no poetry. I wanted to be able to read the wonderful poems, like The Walrus and the Carpenter. However, this edition has no table of contents, and no index, which means I am unable to search for and go to the places in the book I am interested in. This makes it useless to me. Once again, I am horribly disappointed. Also, the reviews all praise the illustrations, but unfortunately, there aren't any!"
2,Hard to understand.,The actor does a good job acting out the voices of the character but its extremely difficult to understand him when he tries to act as Alice.
3,book review.,bought this book for my best friend's birthday. didn't make it on time but when it did finally arrive it was in great condition.
5,Best created fictional world that represents the real one!!!,"This is one of the best boks to ever use imaginary animal characters to represent the actual world. It includes the common society problems which come about in everyday basis, but in an imaginary childrens world."
2,In the Rabbit Hole,"This is not a pretty edition. For a serviceable edition just to read the wonderful words of these stories and to have them together, it's ok. The printing is dense and the quality of the paper is poor. The price is great. Not for a gift. Teresa"
5,Alice's Adventures,The book I received was in great condition and arrived in a timely fashion. I was impressed.
4,no pictures,"When I purchased this verison of Alice you were not able to ""look inside!"" so I gambled. I had read the previous reviews which stated such things as ""the illustrations are..."" and "" the original illustrations.."" So I assumed that this was the version with the engraving images used in the original. Unfortunately I bought this book solely with the intent to photocopy and enlarge the images for a Alice themed party so it makes the purchase moot, but the story is nice..."
4,Black & White Illustrations,"ISBN #978-0199558292There are no color illustrations at all in this paperback edition. Only the cover is in color. Amazon should remove or revise the review about the hardcover edition, to prevent confusion (it references color illustrations). Having said that, this copy does include both 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' and 'Through the Looking-Glass,' and contains many wonderful black & white illustrations, plus extensive notes (thank you Oxford)."
4,This is a book about a little girl who has crazy dreams.,"This book takes place in Alice's living room and through her looking glass.(Her mirror) Alice is a sweet little girl whose cat just had kittens. She was talking to one of them, and then thought about what it would be like to live through the looking glass. While she is thinking she falls asleep.She has a very strange dream about going to looking glass land. She almost makes her dream seem real!"
4,me,i think this book is very good for girls in my age..because sometimes i also would like to flie out of this stressy world and alice is able to..
3,haven't read it yet!,recently saw the movie and decided I wanted to read the original book! but unfortunately I haven't read it yet.
1,HORRIBLE,STILL have not recieved product! very disappointed where as this was supposed to be for a high school project in which now i STILL dont have the book to use and project is due very soon! what is going on ?
3,A MUST HAVE FOR FANS OF TAROT AND/OR ALICE,"This is my fifth tarot deck and I have to say that I just love it. It's quite clever to design a deck based on the classic ""Alice in Wonderland."" Would have rated this deck higher except that it does NOT comes with an instruction book, but rather a quick-and-to-the-point pamphlet that truly simplifies the meanings of the cards. If, however, you are versed in the traditional Ryder-Waite deck then you should have no trouble skipping the pamphlet and using your own intuition. The suits have been reconfigured into flamingoes, oysters, hats, and peppermills, which can be quite confusing. Due to the whimsical nature of the card, you might want to use it for more whimsical readings. But, like I said, if you ARE a fan of tarot decks with unusual design you should DEFINITELY get this deck and use it for those ""special"" occasions."
2,get a magnifying glass,"I was super sad when this book arrived :( The print was sooooo small that no one wanted to read it. When purchasing the book on Amazon there was no ""preview"" of the pages or inside of the book. I guess that I learned my lesson. I ended up purchasing a different Alice's Adventures In Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass book so that we could read a book that had larger print. I was not happy with this book, and would not recommend it to anyone if you enjoy ""normal"" size print. This was really tiny!!!!!The book arrived in good shape and the shipping was satisfactory."
5,Just Fantastic!,"Alice in Wonderand/Through the Looking Glass is one the best books out there. The characters are far-fetched and just insane I could relate to each and every one of them.Caroll a very clever man knows how too make this book even more fun and exciting by adding cute little riddles & puzzles which absolutely make no sense but are fun to try and work out anyways.Caroll also knows how to give clever remarks to his characters with one my favourties being:""I can't go back to yesterday for I was different person then.""There are others I remeber vaguely since I haven't picked up the book a while, put they all make me smile which such witty sarcasm.I also recommend The Looking Glass Wars an alternate more darker version of Alice in Wonderland/Through the Looking Glass which will disappoint.Ciao"
5,Not Just a Beloved Children's Book!,"This book is a delight to both young and old, and as many times as I've read it or had it read to me, I still love the story. For one thing the characters are unforgettable. Who can forget the Queen of Hearts, Tweedledum and Tweedledee and the Mad Hatter? There are so many adaptations of this book and so many varied ways to enjoy it, that there is perhaps a danger that it may be overused. I think though that it is best enjoyed read in a book since that is where the imagination can take over and make the book something magical. Take the time to reread this great classic. It's well worth it."
3,New but defective needs to be made clear,"The book was new, but defective. It looked like it was marked as defective by someone. A large black permanent marker was used to mark a line down the side of the book along the edges of the pages. I looked in the book to see what was wrong with it and a few of the pages were smeared but still legible. There should have been some indication that it was defective and what the defect was. I am assuming that new means new. New with a defect needs to be made clear. This is misleading."
5,This book is a wonderful book,"This book is almost like a dream.The way Lewis Carol sweeps you out of your world and into Alice's is simply wonderful.Inside this book of dreams are alot of details about how life was back then, they're just not straight forward.I think this book is appropriate for every age."
5,Very Nice.,Wonderful copy. Nice interior. Has original pictures. One of my favourite books treated to a nice printing!
4,Nephew loved it,"My nephew loved this book and had me read it to him. I always saw the movies but this was the first I actually read the book. I thought it quite better than any of the movies. The fact that it inspires my nephew to read is a wonderful achievement.For those who love adventure books with very little sex, profanity or graphic violence, then I'd reccomend The Unsuspecting Mage by Brian S. Pratt. This book was another of my nephew's favorites as well as some teens that I'm acquainted with. I liked it as well. He's a new author, but writes a good tale."
2,A Journey with Alice,"I thought Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was what the Disney movie was based on, and Through the Looking Glass was another adventure she had. But that is not the case here. The Disney movie version is based on a combination of both books. I think this is important to mention, as it will hardly be like the movie version we all know.I love the movie (both the 1951 Disney classic and the new Tim Burton version) and figured I would love the book as well, but this book screwed with me. I have always had a vivid imagination, but never non-sensical imagination. That is exactly what Mr. Carroll had when he wrote this book. The book does, however, contain many of the beloved movie characters- the caterpillar, the white rabbit, Queen of Hearts, Mad Hatter, Dormouse, and of course, the Cheshire cat.Overall, the two stories amused me and kept me entertained, but I would not read them again. I am glad to have read them, though, as Alice's tale is a classic one."
3,"Some nostalgia, but not enough","I would rate this lower if the rating were based simply on how I felt about the book.Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was easy to read, mildly entertaining, and terribly familiar. I can't tell if the entertainment came from familiarity or not - so much of Alice is simply part of cultural memory that I knew it without ever having read the book. It was silly, but for a time, it progressed. Alice was trying to get into the garden and was exploring the nonsense world as she went along.Through the Looking Glass was different. I had a hard time reading it. I didn't find it entertaining. The pieces made no sense together, and the goal of becoming a queen by making it to the eighth square seemed an afterthought. It may be that Through the Looking Glass was a better dream narrative (it certainly seemed a good example of the kind of play young children engage in), but I still had a hard time reading it."
2,not good.,"I fully expected this book to be illistrated. obviously the reviews I read were for another publication. Without the trippy artwork,the book is just no fun to read."
2,I do not recomend this title - labeling is misleading,"This purports to be a compilation of ""Alice"", but in fact contains only the full text of ""Through the Looking Glass"""
5,Curiouser and curiouser...,"I have been reading Alice all of my life and every time I find something new. Like Hamlet, it only gets better with age, but it has a much happier ending. This is one of those books that every child should read...every adult too. Look for the Cheshire Cat: ""Did you say pig, or fig?"" I think he is hilarious. :)"
5,The best children's book ever,"This is the edition I had as a child--still have, in fact. It is well priced and very attractive, but be warned, it is missing one Tenniel illustration: the one of Alice (in her tiny state) playing with the puppy that is as big as a cart-horse. Caveat aside, this book belongs in every home. It is a classic of fantastic literature, and reveals new depths with every re-reading."
4,it made me in Wonderland,"Alice in Wonderland, is a creative and fun book anyone would enjoy reading. Although that the book was made for a childerns fanasty, it is a wonderful way for elders get in touch with thier young spirit. This book was a gateway to better thinking, and helps you get the hole picture. If one where to think about it, anyone would like to be Alice, eating mushrooms, talking to Quenns, and finding new Adventure around every corner. I now read this book at least every other month."
2,Terrible Customer Service,"I did receive my book within the time frame I was given. However, when I emailed them for a tracking number, I never heard a reply until now. It took 7 months to get the tracking number for my book. Although I did get my book, I am urging you to think twice before buying from this company. I value customer service very highly; 7 months in unacceptable.NOTE: I bought this book from goHastings"
3,"Average at best, as children's lit goes.","I am fully ready to admit that part of the problem may be that I did not read these books--either of them--as a child. That said, I am a huge sci-fi and fantasy fan and certainly don't have a lack of imagination, even at 27. Just a couple of years ago I re-read all of the Chronicles of Narnia, and enjoyed them just as much as--if not more than--I enjoyed them as a child.All of that said, yes, Carroll did a wonderful job portraying the messiness, strangeness, and scenery switches of a dream. But as a whole...his works barely rate a 3 on a one to five scale. In fact...I'd probably go with a 2.5 at best. Although some of his Victorian satire was certainly amusing, I feel as if these books were mostly nonsense and simply didn't contain the literary merit to render it a classic with the likes of, for example, Hans Christian Anderson, J.M. Barrie, L. Frank Baum, Beatrix Potter, Roald Dahl, the Grimm brothers, etc."
4,For everyone,This is a complex book disguised as a childrens book. It's much more complicated than that. It looks inside dreams. It's all just a big trip. And everyone knows about the Caterpillar with his hookah...... Good but easy read.
4,Full of Adventure,"Both books are very good. I read both of these when I was 11. The story is fun and it really makes your imagination go wild. All though the story is about strange creatures and people, it is also about real life things. At some points the story was boring, but never for long, because something un-expected would always happen. This is a wonderful book, that everyone who can read English should read."
1,Wrong,"I ordered the Penguin Classics version of this book, and the seller shipped me the Signet Classics version."
2,I did not enjoy Alice in Wonderland,"Ok, so everyone says that Alice in Wonderland was such a wonderful book, yes,yes, I am aware. But, I thought it was very confusing and all the characters were very stupid. I mean, it's not even a book about anything. Sure, it's trying to say that shes is growing up in the process of the dumb dream world but who cares?It was a bad way to write a story, or better yet it was a bad story to write about in the 1st place."
2,Boring,"I dont get why old books like these are called ""classics"". I've seen the cartoon as a kid and wanted to read the original book to see what made it so special. Now I know that its not special. Its a lot of nonsense, thats a little creative, but nothing that really takes you away from reality. A lot of the characters are unique, but only appear for a brief period and aren't fully developed (or even partialy).Usually I'm a bad critic because its easy for me to enjoy anything, but I've had a tough time getting through this one, I dont even think its a good childrens book, they'll say the same thing I do. BORING. Save the $3 and buy yourself a cup of coffee, you'll find yourself more entertained with measuring out the sugar and cream and more satisfied to sip on that than to power through this."
1,Great classic,I bought this book for my wife. She loves it. It brings back old memories. Maybe when she is finished she will let me read it.
4,Pleased,"I had gleaned from reading that this was one of the best copies of the story. It was in a little rougher shape than stated, but am please to have it. Being able to buy used items, especially DVD sets and books is great. Thank you."
3,ccms review,"This is a really great book! But at some points the book got a little boring to build up a climax. The basic idea of the story was what she found in her ""Wonder land."" I would recommend this book for people who are dreamers and like unusual stories."
5,Both Alice books are my two favorite reads.,"Ever since I can remember, I've loved watching ""Alice in Wonderland"". About, oh, five or six ago, when I was about 13 or 14, I bought this book, containing both Alice books, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There.No matter how many times I read these two books, I never just stop in the middle and not finish. It's amazing howthe two stood the test of times.Now, at 19, I still read them all the time."
4,Best [cheap] illustrated version for Kindle,"Buying a copy for $10 seemed silly when there are so many options for less than $2. This is the best of the cheap ones. As another reviewer stated, the poetry format is not as good as it could be -- but at least it's formatted like a poem! This version contains the original illustrations, but other versions appeared to have additional original-looking illustrations included. I'm not sure why there's the difference."
3,alice review,"I thought it was funny and entertaining, but to be honest I was expecting something in the line of a masterpiece and I'm a little disappointed. The story is amazingly childish and crude and the worthwhile parts are very distinct and separate from the rest of the lackluster story. Still, the wordplay is ingenious and the book is an all around treat."
1,Where is the Looking Glass?,"I purchased this book because I was specifically lo0king for the sequel, Through the Looking-Glass. I already have ""Alice"", and for free. This edition claims Looking Glass in its title, but only includes Alice. Do not be fooled. Get Alice for free and skip this misleading version."
1,PAGE 37 MISSING A LINE,"This mass market paperback edition of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking Glass by Signet classics is MISSING A LINE on page 37 during the mouse's poem. Another reviewer noted this as well. I don't know why this edition has sold so well and garnered such positive reviews when there is an obvious error. I purchased it after reading that review and thinking he must be mistaken, but he is right, it is there."
5,Child/Adulthood classic,"WOW!!! never read this book as a kid or even seen the movie, but as an adult i absolutely loved it. So much going on its hard to keep up, but it does a great job at keeping one's attention. Both stories were great, but i liked the original one a little better than the sequel."
5,Alice in Wonderland,"My 10 year old grandaughter is the owner of Alice in Wonderland and so far she loves it. I sent it to her because I loved it so much when I was her age. She does spend time reading aloud to her little brother, so he loves it too. My son tells me he listens in to the reading quite often so it is a hit all around."
5,Classic.,"The Mad Hatter, the Ugly Duchess, the Mock Turtle, the Queen of Hearts, the Cheshire Cat-characters each more eccentric than the last, and that could only have come from Lewis Carroll, the master of sublime nonsense. In these two brilliant burlesques he created two of the most famous and fantastic novels of all time that not only stirred our imagination but revolutionized literature."
2,"Two books for the price of one? Nope, just one book.","Last week I downloaded the free version of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. All the poetry was missing from it. I didn't realize it right away until I got to the chapter with the Mock Turtle. So, I came across this version and it was very appealing because I thought I was getting both books for just 99 cents. At first I was mostly satisfied since I saw the poetry, but the formatting of the book was weird. There would be a line of text and then the next line would only have a couple words. Also, this download only has Alice in Wonderland. This review is supposed to be for ""Alice in Wonderland & Through the Looking-Glasss"", but after you download the book the cover says ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"". Somebody made a huge mistake somewhere and now I have to go buy Through the Looking-Glass."
3,"Kindle edition is rough around edges, price is right","Sentences are not typeset correctly for the Kindle but, hey, for $2, who can complain. Two of the great classics for almost free? Great to have it available. 5 stars for content (of coruse), 5 stars for price. 2 stars for production value."
5,Classic,"What can I say about a classic? Always loved this, and love sharing it now with my children."
3,Kindle version info misleading,"This is not a review of the book, you can refer to the printed (or many of the Kindle versions) for that. Rather this is a comment on the Kindle file. I was specifically looking for a version that included the illustrations, and as this version listed John Tenniel under author information I hoped these would be included... they aren't. It does look like a well formatted version of the book, with an introduction by the editor, the original poetry from the beginning of the story (which some public domain versions lack), the original italicized text rather than CAPITAL letters as in some public domain versions, and a good approximation of the unique text formatting as seen in the printed book. It does not have a table of contents."
4,worth the read,"This book was a joy to read. I recommend it to anyone who wants a brief history of alternative religions/cults in America. The author does a great job of giving the reader a feel for the orgins, ideas, and impact of many different religions.Now what this book does not do is provide an indepth look at religions. All religions are covered in brief.The one glaring flaw of this book is that the author sees virtually all religions and cults through rose colored glasses. He does a great job of showing the positive aspects of various religions/cults but ignores the down side.An additional book I recommend is THE NEW BELIEVERS by David V. Barrett. It provides a more contemporary account of America's and Britian's alternative religions and cults. It tends to focus more on the beliefs and practices of various religious movements rather than their history."
1,Reliability,"Over a period of two years I purchased three JVC S-VHS decks, including this model. Each one failed at about two years, possibly through lack of use - certainly not over-use. Considering my 8 year old Sony VHS and 15 and 18 year old BETAs continue to operate flawlessly, I would not be able to recommend any JVC tape unit."
3,Looks Better than it Works,"I purchased this item primarily for its esthetics but also thought it might be practical since it would free up storage space. Although it looks okay, I have found that it is difficult to use the twist top since some spices cannot be easily shaken out the small opening. So you have to take the top off the jar which is very tight. You also need a fair amount of counter space to display the easel."
4,Thanks for taking care of the problem,"January 23, 11Dear Folks,My first order got lost or something. It never arrived. You were very punctual to get another copy of the book I ordered sent to me. I REALLY appreciated this. Thank you very much. Sandy"
3,Simplistic at the root - you probably already know it !!,"Griner gives accurate statistics which support his theories (and teaches of the reality of western medicine & north american fads). He looks at how the whole physiology effects the body (something many therapist miss) which enables the treament of the cause - not the symptom. After reading through to the end, you'll find that his technique is simply Cyriax frictions alternating with tappotment. I think the greatest tool of this book with an R.M.T. in mind is a reminder that too much is detramental."
2,the author shows contempt for fiction,"I just happened to pick this book up and read it without the preceding works in this series as a foundation. It might be that after reading all of his earlier books Lescroart's 'Second Chair' might be comfortable territory for the initiated. But as a stand alone book, this is pretty tired fare. The plot is far fetched and does not gel into the remotest idea of cohesion. The story bumps along from one character to the next like a bad auto accident. The characters are cardboard cut outs that are painful to imagine. And lastly the ending is a disaster of major ""saw that coming"" proportions.The writing style itself is not too shabby, though Lescroart could have whittled down the story by a hundred pages and lost nothing.Plainly, this is just a sub par Grisham."
2,Utterly Predictable,Having read all his last six books Lescroart disappointed me with this one. I was able to guess both the Executioner and how the two stories involving Glitsky and Hardy were going to converge half way through the book. The next 200 odd pages were then difficult to get through.Lescroart still retains his captivating style and warm characters but this book is living off the success of his last couple with constant references to events from the First Law. If I hadn't read The First Law before this one I would have struggled to understand what all the references to the previous year was about.I would only recommend this book to his die hard fans.
3,You've got to believe in the kid,Another lawyer/cop book which was enjoyable. I liked The Vig better but this is still a good story about a teen accused of a double murder and what it takes to prove that he did (or didn't) commit the crimes. I wanted to read some of this author's older books because he has a new one coming out in February that I want to read. I figured some background knowledge might help me with the new book.
4,SO FUN!,"The idea of this game is either racing, competing or practicing in skiing or snowboarding. While this game is very repetative, it's also fun.In the version of the game where you compete against the computer to earn trick points, it is nearly impossible to win. The tricks in this game just don't rack up enough points. But the racing and multiplayer versions make it all worth your while.The different landscapes are hard to unlock, but the basic one is pretty fun...Overall, this game could be better, but it's all worth it."
4,good game....a must have for people wiith new psp's,this is a good game but IF YOU ALREADY HAVE SSX 3 DONT GET IT! ITS THE SAME TRAILS ACCEPT WITH DIFFERENT NAMES!! I have ssx 3 for my gamecube and its actually funner than this game...check it out. you can only snowboard in that game though. i am a skiier in real life and i LOVE THE SKIING PART! it is a lot funner than the snowboarding. it has awesome graphics. the only thing is that i wish there was different trails..otherwise...thumbs up
3,SSX on tour,"SSX on tour est moins bon que d'autres jeux SSX car celui-la est un peu trop répété. Ceci dit, c'est un bon jeu avec une sensation vraie de la neige. Omn crois etre a la montagne. Je ne regrette pas mon argent, meme si ce jeu pourrait etre mieux. Bonjour a la suisse...."
3,Difficulties snowboarding this learning curve.,"I remember playing SSX Tricky as if it were yesterday.That was one heck of a game for the Xbox.I just fixed up a PSP that I bought for dirt cheap, and I've gone on a game buying binge.I was really excited to play some SSX again (Tricky was the last time I'd done so).Your character starts out with now skills, and is fairly slow compared to anyone you race against.I have yet to be able to beat one race, and yet I've been playing for well over 2 hours.Sure you could call me incompetent, but it is the steep learning curve in this game.I can understand basic tricks, and maneuvering is fairly easy, but isn't at least the first race supposed to be easy?"
1,Very weak,This little vibe really doesn't do much. Even on the highest setting there is not much stimulation--you are better off just using one of the little covers on your finger and doing it yourself. Fine for foreplay but not if that is all you are using to get off.
3,Older Marrage,This for an older couple getting married. A gag gift for two 50+ getting hitched later in life. Good Luck.
2,eats batteries,came with deaad batteries because the off switch is loose. Tried the ribbed sleeve and absolutely loved it. Unfortunately the back up batteries were dead the next time I reached for it-
5,great music!,I am from Brasil and I am greatful to have these bossa nova cds available to us all. Fabulous sounds.
2,My thoughts,They should have better description of product. It didn't fit my lens and I don't know what size lens it would fit. The part that should attach to the lens was huge. I have had several slr cameras and that hood did not fit any of my lenses.
3,Better than the no-name hoods but not very good,"Compared to the Fujifilm hoods, Nikon hoods don't latch very well and they are flimsy. Nikon probably makes more profit selling replacement hoods than they do on the lenses. The only good thing is that they are better than the off brand alternatives. The Fujifilm hoods (which don't mount on Nikon lenses unfortunately) are about twice as thick and latch much better."
2,the chiefs,This is not one of his better books After the first chapter I got bored with the book would not recommend this book
4,Chiefs: A Novel - my take,"I have always enjoyed Stuart Woods' stories. I thought this one started out more slowly, butenjoyed how it developed and crossed over several generations. The characters, as usual,were well developed. Always a great ending."
4,CHIEFS,"INTERESTING TO READ THIS BOOK AND TO THEN TO READ HIS ""BARRINGTON"" BOOKS AND SEE HOW THE MONEY CORRUPTS.WHAT STARTS OUT WITH SUCH PROMISE OF FINE WORKS TO COME BY WOODS BECOMES SUCH PULP LATER."
3,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED FROM WOODS,"If you bought Chiefs to read the style you know of Stuart's writing you would be disappointed as I was. I am glad his writing improved to the style we see him in his more current work. Chiefs was not what I expected. The publisher said ""this volume will be a collector's treasure for all fans of Stuart Woods"" and I could not agree less. If this had been the first Stuart Woods book I read I would not have read all is other more current works. The Stone Barrington books and the stories in new Mexico and good well written thrillers with some goos associate to reality in them. The Chiefs just did not have that for me. Thank goodness I found his more likeable work in current issues."
2,so-so,"This was a decent read. I think the plot was a bit scattered and the dialogue shift between some of the characters was over used and cliché, but for the most part the book was okay.The authors slips a bit of sociology in there too. You see a circle of events but you also see the answer to questions that, as adults, we see in kids. "" How can anyone hate like that?"" Well, the family may be part of the reason and in this story, you get that. A racist father, a racist son and so one. The progression makes sense. The honest father, the honest son."
4,An incredible journey through time and politics of the Deep South.,"Chiefs is a wonderful romp through the first half of the twentieth century in the Deep South. Police Chiefs, City Leaders and Town Folk a like have their time in the spotlight, for better or worse. You'll be surprised at the people who deserve to die and Don't. The hero's who deserve to live and Don't and the people who just need some sense knocked In to 'em!"
3,Much different that other Stuart Woods books,"Chiefs: was very good, but not what I expected. Hard for me to keep up with changes in time, but good overall."
5,All downhill from here.........,"I guess we all change along the way, Woods included. I absolutely loved ""CHIEFS"" when I read it eons ago. I have tried many of his Stone Barrington novels and none seem even remotely close to CHIEFS. Obviously there's a market out there for his Barrington books: he keeps getting them published. In my non-scholarly opinion it seems the literary world would have been better off if ""CHIEFS"" had been his first and last novel, ala Margaret Mitchell. (But I don't wish Mr. Woods to share Mitchell's fate!)"
2,"fair condition of book, but book is good","The book was only in fair condition, which was kinda disapponting, but the book is very good. No offense to anyone"
4,"Great southern history, wonderful characters.",Although this was a fictional account of a small town in the south I felt as though I was reading the real history of honest heroes in the battle for early civil rights. The characters through the generations were wonderfully defined. I found myself entrenched with each family as they fought hard for their fellow man.
3,chiefs,Well written in that the story is expressed well. Good night time reading as its not a nail biter. Historical and casual.
5,Chief's by James Patterson,"I found this book in my collection of books. Affter reading the back cover as to what it was about, I realized I had never read it. This is the first book James Patterson ever wrote, and could not believe I had not read it as I am a James Patterson fan. This was such a good book that I could not stop reading it. I would encourage all fans of James Patterson to get this book and read it. Since I found it, I am going back to some of his older books to see if I might have missed others. I would highly recommend reading this book. My brother was at my home visiting. He started reading it and could not put it down. When he was finished with it, I then read it. I have no idea where I got this paper book version, but plan to get back on Amazon to research other books he has written."
5,"Truly, a believable story",I am a fan of Stuart Woods. Chiefs is a wonderful book about real life people. The color and theme is super. I have never read such a book. It was homey as well as frightening in places...kept you on the edge at all times....
3,2 Pack Hooks might be just what you need ...,"Staples has apparently stopped selling cubicle/over-the-door coat hooks (like you see on a lot of cubicles if you work in an office environment). I am sure there is still plenty of demand, but these hooks are the closest I have been able to find. Made by Stanley, this is PROBABLY A GOOD BUY. However, try to get it locally if you can. I bought from Amazon seller ""Aubuchon Hardware"" and they charged me about $7 to ship a $3 item. Additionally, when I contacted the seller, they said that I could refuse delivery and get a refund, which was a lie because they shipped the package by US Mail! (At the time of this review, Aubuchon is the only Amazon company who offers this product). Additionally, it took about 13 days to receive my item. This was not during the holidays, and there was really no excuse for it to take so long, given that I received similar shipments from other Amazon sellers, (ordered the SAME day) in only 3 business days!"
3,Garbo Is Good; Movie Is Fair,"When I saw this about 15 years ago on VHS, it was my first look at the famous Greta Garbo and I was impressed She was a pretty woman who exhibited class and intelligence, reminding me of Ingrid Bergman, although not as pretty.There are a number of subtly-funny lines in here which kind of characterizes the film: okay bit a little slow-moving and not what it could be if it just had a little more a spark to it. The dialog from Melvyn Douglas and Ina Claire really dates the film. Douglas, as he was in a lot of movies I've seen with him, is not a likable guy. He can be very annoying, but some of that is because he's doing such a fine acting job.""Ninotchka"" develops into a nice romance story in the second half of the movie with a short, satisfying ending and a pointed comment about living in Russia, at that time, as opposed to a free country.If you've heard about Garbo, and never seen her, this is a good place to start!"
3,nice story,"It was interesting but it left a lot unanswered and seemed to end too soon.......wish the author would have fleshed out the relationship with her uncle more and her involvement in politics etc.......it just ended way too soon, some of the characters were one dimensional and would have been a fuller read with more about them.......but the story itself was ok just needed more to give it substance and depth that it lacked."
2,"Not too bad, but not too good.","I liked the core idea of the book and the fast pace. The formatting could have been better, there were a lot of spots where the scene changed but there was no page transition, so it looked like one long garbled mess. The grammer and and sentance structure could use some work, but considering that English is not the author's first language it was not too bad, I have seen worse from native born speakers. Some of the characters seemed rather one dimensional and there was a great deal of development. Other than that I would say this was a good first effort from a new writer."
1,Just another soap opera,"This booklet never really got off the ground for me. It's to short and could have been much better if their was more to it. I waisted my free Prime borrowed book for the month on it. Not worth it. Try Lisa See's books or Amy Tan, much better story and characters."
3,Key Organizer,It is just like it says it should be. I should have read the dimensions. The photos make it look much much larger than it is. If you are really wanting something for organizing keys I would suggest something larger. Keys literally hang on top of each other in this one.
2,Cheaply made and looks it,This is made out of some very cheap thin plastic and looks it. It is not something you want to mount where people can see it. It does function but I think after some use it will just fall apart. Like I said its made cheap with poor craftsmanship. The key holders on the inside are fit into the holder very tightly but also made out of very cheap plastic and you have to be very careful not to break them taking them out. It's a neat idea and could be very useful. However its made so poorly I'm afraid it wont last very long.
4,awesome performance,"I've had mine about a week and it's working great. Best picture I've ever had, better than the Sony 799 and Toshiba M-755 I tried recently. It has some kind of noise reduction that completely eliminated the picture noise that the others had. Still/slow/search pictures were also better than others. Recording was perfect on regular tapes in SVHS-ET mode. Excellent jog control on the remote.but the way they do some things left me shaking my head, like:* not being able to view the channels while adding/removing channels, something that seems to be 'popular' now :(* no time search, just index* can't change volume of TV (or any TV function) with remote unless you hold down 2 buttons at once (""TV"" button and function), unless you have a JVC TV* funky display characteristics, like how it shows graph on screen when rewinding/forwarding - and you can't remove it!so it's great performance with a few design niggles."
2,Shallow Plot,"I was disappointed with this book. Although there was plenty of action, the characters were not developed and I almost quit reading it half way through. The plot was very transparent and the story, as told, was not believable at all. I would not recommend this book."
2,Lots of action; not much suspense,"It's not much of a novel, but I bet it will be a terrific teen action movie. (In fact, the same story in a different setting already WAS a terrific movie back in 1981, ""Taps"")The book reads as though it was fleshed out from a screenplay. There is little exposition, back-story, plot intersection. It's your basic, linear white-hat vs black-hat war story, the twist being that the white-hats are teenagers and the black-hats are adults."
2,Boring and predictable.,"I read Sleepers years ago and remember liking it so I thought I'd give this book a try. Street Boys never really took off. The story was predictable from beginning to end. I could have put the book down at any time and not regretted it, but I kept on going thinking that it would get better. It didn't. The characters were unbelievable, the writing was stilted. I gave this book two stars because a teen might like it, but I can't imagine recommending it to anyone else."
2,Lifted???,It's interesting how much of the plot of this novels seems to have been lifted from a 1970 Rock Hudson movie entitlled HORNET'S NEST.
3,Quick Reading,This is quick and entertaining reading. Although it is predictable and unrealistic at the same time the author creates a quick and easy read that is exciting and entertaining.
2,The truth is stranger (and better) than Fiction,"How much liberty should a fiction writer have over a true and heroic effort of history? Street Boys is an inventive tale of the events of those riveting four days, but why stray so far from the truth? Heroes of the past deserve a just tribute, and in this case the truth is far more gripping. There was no American star that taught these poor boys to fight, and moreover, the bravest of the boys who did on their own were each awarded Gold medals of Honor for valor, an all-empowering fact that Carcaterra seemingly overlooked in his fiction.An enthralling depiction closer to the truth can be found in the 1980 book and now audiocassette title ""Four Days of Naples"" or the 1963 Academy Award nominated film of the same name by Nanni Loy. It will be interesting to see if Carcaterra's 2002 tale receives as much acclaim. Though I seriously doubt it."
4,It's all about bravery,"This book might not have been very accurate, but the auther did tell us at the beggining of the novel that not everything was accurate. Its a very compelling book about how brave children faught the german army. They faugh from the heart like true soldiers. Even though this book is not very accurate it is a good book to read, it shows what bravery is."
1,Very disappointing--desperately searching 2nd movie deal,"This is the third Carcaterra book that I have read (Sleepers, Apaches) and by far the worst. The scenes in this book are so unbelievable, I found myself stressed about finishing the final 1/3 of the book. There is a stead-fast rule in this book: If a character has a name, he/she is probably not going to die. I feel Carcaterra realized this in coming to the end of writing, so he kills off several characters in a matter of pages.I also feel that Carcaterra remembered that he introduced the idea of conspiracy from the other street boys in the late rounds of writing and realized that he had to kill their leader before moving forward.Overall, I would not recommend this book to anyone. I regretfully picked this book up in an airport bookstore based on my past experience with Carcaterra novels. This will be my last based on the fact that I felt he was whoring his writing out and begging for a movie deal with his latest work."
1,Very Disappointed,"I purchased this book because it was about two of my favorite topics, Naples and WWII. The author lured me into thinking this was a historical novel, but that is not true. He has no sense of geography. Anyone standing in Naples and facing the sea will have Vesuvio to their LEFT, not the right. Salerno is SOUTH of Naples. There were many errors in the Italian phrases in the book. The story seemed based on early sixties war films. Connors jeep apparently had a bottomless fuel tank. In spite of fierce battles all around, he and Nunzia find time for a ""quickie"". The German Colonel reacts to everything by slamming his fist on something. Charecters appearing in one part of the city, then another part of the city without the benefit of public transportation.There are countless true stories about the bravery of the Sgunnizzi [street boys] that need to be told. Perhaps another author will do them justice."
1,Poorly researched and poorly written,"What a disappointment! There is very little in this book that merits even one star, but that's as low as I could find.Carcaterra knows virtually nothing of military tactics or equipment, and very little of the events in Naples that this book tries to portray.He is completely out of his element in writing this story, and anyone who has ever served in the military will be unable to finish the bookPerhaps Carcaterra should stay with the ""Sleepers"" theme, which he seems to know about."
1,no idea,yet to receive it.Have no clue where the wire reached.Am confused whether i was able to cancel it or did i just take it as one of those loses that do tend to happen over internet shopping.
2,very average,as much as I dig Warren Beatty's work i can't get down with this film.only Harvey Keitel makes this film worth seeing.the only good thing that came out of this film was the union of Beatty&Bening.very cliched Gangster flick.Ok writing&Directing but nothing special.
3,wouldnt we all have rather seen a movie about moe green?,"warren beatty indulged himself yet again (tho not as severely as in ""dick tracy"") in this overblown biopic of gangster bugsy siegel, whose fascination with celebrity led to his virtual one-man founding of las vegas as a gambling and entertainment mecca, and eventually to his murder by the mob once he grew too big for his britches. yet, in a movie paying homage to a man of excess, it is the excess which draws us in. the garishness works here; its a pity that theres no depth -- but then again, in a tribute to las vegas, maybe thats what director barry levinson was aiming for."
5,Excellent,Pros:*Warren Beatty was as cool acting and looking as it gets.*Harvey Keitel was BRILLIANT(as always.)Especially when he gets angry.*Anette Benning was terrific.Very convincing.*The movie's got that sweet Italian-mob atmosphere in it.Cons:*Might be a little confusing.The bottomline:You should definitely see it.This is one of the movies that you would brag about watching it in front of others.
1,"Not worth a star, but Amazon insists on one","Many years ago I saw this movie in a movie theater and was totally smitten by Anette Bening. Without Bening it would be just a mediocre romance set in a classic mob environment and played by otherwise mediocre actors. But Bening makes it sparkle. Well, don't buy this DVD, the quality of picture and sound is so bad it will make you cry. It's actually not much better than illegal copies of movies filmed from the screen. No wonder it was available as a cheapie at Amazon. If you haven't seen this movie before, stay away from this DVD and wait for a better quality version even if it costs a bit more."
2,Poor portrayal of Bugsy,"I purchased this DVD because I love movies with Las Vegas settings. I was excited to finally see the story of the visionary Bugsy and his dream of an upscale casino in Nevada. I will not get into the numerous historical inaccuracies. I expected the history to be screwed up; and it was, but I wanted a more accurate portrayal of Bugsy. Beatty just gave off too much of a Woody Allen vibe for my taste."
3,Not up to the good mobster films,Very few pretty boys are any good at playing gangsters. Warren Beatty is not one of them. And Annette Bening is much too shrill.
2,Could have been alot better...,"Somehow this movie really never takes off. In the days of Lucky Luchiano, Meyer Lansky & Capone, it really could have been good, but the focus is more on Bugsy's strange personality than it is about the mob. If you're looking for that good solid punch that Donnie Brasco had, it's not here & its a shame. I was surprised it was rated so high here on amazon."
3,Near-Perfect Storytelling&#65533; Unworthy Story.,"""Bugsy"" is Wonderfully brought to life by Warren Beatty's Energetic and Likeable Performance and it is Timelessly brought to the Screen by Barry Levinson's Lustful Direction. Great Set and Costume design and Startling Performances from the Supporting cast are thrown into the mix; the one Ingredient Missing was an Arresting Screenplay. The Dialogue may be Great and a few scenes here and there are Fairly Memorable, but the Time-period of Ben ""Bugsy"" Seagals like chosen to be Portrayed in this film isn't the most Interesting point of his Legendary Life."
3,Bugsy (Unrated Extended Cut),"It was a good movie, it fits well among these types of crime films mixing fact with fiction. The extended version adds to the interest."
1,One of the worst movies I have ever seen,"Definitely in the bottom five. The screen play strains to include the well-known historical points of its subject into the film in the most ham-fisted and contrived ways in an attempt to build a feature film length linear story. It fails heroically. The skeleton story is padded out with fabricated hokum, Hollywood star turns by Warren Beatty in possibly his most annoying performance ever, and gratuitous violence galore. If ever there was a must-miss it's this pile of garbage."
2,The Wooden Mob,"Key components to this movie -1, The Mob 2, LV 3, Seigel&Hill; 4, Beatty&Bening;The screen play is of the highest calibre, with a detailed retelling of the Seigel story. Further the acting of certain characters is excellent, Harvey Keitel and Ben Kingsley.Sadly I fear Beatty's performance falls, at times, into slapstick - more of the vein of Stallone in ""Oscar"" than one of the most feared players of Murder Inc.I summary I'd say if you are a fan of the genre watch this movie despite Beatty, and if you are a fan of Beatty watch this movie despite the genre!"
4,Bugsy,"A film classic if you want to see how the Mafia was behind the building of Las Vegas. While the story is true, Annette Benning and Warren Beaty's peroformance brings a light heated approach (if you can say that)to the story. This is one video which my better half enjoys bringing out and watch over and again. A timeless piece of work if you don't take it too seriously."
5,Levinson Outdoes Coppola at his own game!,"Warren Beatty is Benjamin ""Bugsy"" Siegel, the father of Las Vegas. Thanks to director Barry Levinson, we see ""Bugsy"" Siegel the true visionary of a Las Vegas and all that implies. This film has a romance that the ""Godfather"" films lacked. While the narrative is told through Levinson's romantic filmmaking it somehow also has a more realistic feel to it than the ""Godfather"" films. Much of that realism should be credited to the performances of Ben Kingsley as Meyer Lansky, Harvey Keitel as Mickey Cohen, Elliott Gould as Harry Greenberg and Beatty in his best role. Annette Bening as Virginia Hill is a cool customer and not to be overlooked. Composer Ennio Morricone turned in his best score since ""Once Upon a Time in America."" Ben Kingsley should have won the Oscar for Supporting Actor. It was one of the best performances on film. This film has a strange likable quality about it."
2,Bugsy a disapointment,"I was disappointed by this DVD. Watching it, I got bored and just went on to other things. Sort of bothered by an apparent glorification of someone who really wasn't a very nice person."
3,visionary gangster,"As a gangster movie buff, I watched this film with pleasure and some interest. While the story is certainly compelling - Siegel is pursuing power and achievement more than money - there is nothing about it that stood out for me. Sure, he was the kind of leader who built empires, a brutal sociopath with a knack for seeking the glitziest things in life, from his women to business deals that involved movie stars. Then his vision paid off in Las Vegas, surely one of the most spectacular entertainment investments in history. But this film simply lacked some spark for me. Perhaps I am trying to find something as good as or better than Coppola's Godfather series, and this film did not reach that mark for me.Recommended. It is good, if not quite great."
4,Newton,"This book tells us Isaac Newton in detail. It tells us about his life as a man, philosopher, theologian, alchemist, scientist and public figure. It tells us how he interact with other scientist and how his ancestors were like. I've learned many things about Newton that I didn't know before. Before I read this book I didn't know that he had involved with alchemy or theology. This book convinces me why Newton is one of the greatest scientists in history"
5,"Stimulating, Informative, Inspirational","I couldn't agree with reviewer #1 more! As a doctoral engineer, I thought I knew everything about that greatest scientist that ever lived. But I was wrong. Westfall taught me plenty about his life and times."
5,Very happy with the product and the shipping,"As I'm working on learning German, I thought having some children's books in that language would be helpful, so I ordered this one. It shipped quickly and the condition is excellent. I'm very happy with this product."
1,Bad movie,"Could not understand, sympathize or identify with the mother character, and thought the plot and acting were not even good."
2,"""A Modicum of Value""","There is little to recommend in this film other than the ""cuteness"", effervescence and physical attractiveness of the adolescent female and her mother. Although the plot does have a modicum of redeeming value and entertainment value, they aren't really enough to warrant going out of one's way to view. 2-Stars is about right for this one."
4,Girl in Progress was a fun watch!,I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I thought Eva Mendez gave a great performance as well as the actress in the supporting role of her daughter. The two had a nice on-film chemistry.Girl In Progress
3,a chick flick drama,i would say this movie is a chick flick. not very entertaining..as a mother there were parts that made me mad.and as a fan of eva mendes this was not a winner..i mananged to sit through it but it took alot..i was bored.
3,Alright for a TV Movie,"This movie wasn't anything special, but it was OK. I wouldn't recommend paying for it, but it would pass the time if you're bored and it came on TV."
2,Not very happy with this movie,This was not a movie that I think I would like my 15 Year old daughter to watch. If I could return it I would like to I was not impressed at all.
1,Slow and amateurish,Poorly done and as stated quite amateurish. It simply did not get moving and finally turned it off. If it got any better I'd be surprised.
1,Boring,I just couldn't get into the story line. It just didn't grab. My attention was lost and within 10 minutes I turned it off.
2,boring,"Movie was very boring, not what i expected. The movie does not have much to offer. Overall I would not recommend this movie."
3,Movie just ok,"Quality of movie was good, movie itself was lacking. Needless to say I will not be watching thos movie again, but thank you Amazon for adding it to your selection."
3,Entertaining,"This movie was just okay. I did not really like the cast. Having a mother like that these days would end me up in foster care, so not really realistic to me."
2,SAME MATERIAL NEW TITLE?,"I HAVE NOW PURCHASED THREE OF THEIR DVD'S AND HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED THAT THEY REALLY CONTAIN ALOT OF THE SAME MATERIAL. EACH DVD ONLY HAD 1 PERSON FROM THE SEMINAR TO GET TO ASK A QUESTION,THE ANSWER SEEMED TO GO ON AND ON WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE LET MORE PEOPLE HAVE A CHANCE FOR QUESTIONS. I do use the Law of Attraction and know it works, but probably will not purchase more unless I see someone elses DVD and know it contains alot of new material."
5,History of NC with quilts,"I checked this book out of the Cashiers, North Carolina Library and spent a week browsing it. It has many fascinating color plates of North Carolina's historical quilts. There is an early embroidered farm scene quilt that is particularly spectacular and worthy of reproduction. There are also many black and white vintage photos of North Carolina's quilters in period dress. I spent almost as much time looking at the vintage clothing photographs and the names of the women as I did the photos of the quilts. This is not a ""how to quilt"" book, but I think the photos and historical information in this volume would be beneficial to anyone interested in primary source research in vintage clothing and quilts of southern origin."
4,Good Gift,"My wife and I found this book and decided to get it as a gift for my grandmother, who has arthritis (from making so many quilts) and is no longer able to quilt, but who also loves to read. We found that this fit her well and hope that she enjoyed it!"
2,This is a disappointment,I was very disappointed with this book. There is not much of a story. It's not interesting. I ordered this because I like the lift the flap books. Their are only 4 flaps in the whole book. The story is short and very unimaginative. I am sending it back!!
3,Can't be disassembled,I ordered this hoping to use it outside AND inside. We realized it couldn't be disassembled once the locking pegs were in and returned it. It looks like it would be fun and durable in it's one location but not movable which could be a big problem if you assembled it indoors and ever wanted to move it!
2,"Limited information, poorly presented","I bought this reference because I liked Stanek's book ""Windows XP Professional Administrator's Pocket Consultant."" I was disappointed. It is 275 pages, but the information could be printed in half that if weren't all double-spaced and in large type. It is also cheaply printed--the titles seem to use a drop shadow effect that might have looked good on-screen, but looks more like a bug when printed.Only basic command-prompt stuff is presented. I don't see anything about file name completion, for example, and newer tools like fc (File Compare) are not included.There are six pages on scheduling tasks with the ""at"" command, but it never mentions the newer XP command, schtasks, which is better integrated with the GUI version.Finally, there is no index in the book. There is a chapter that has commands sorted by function rather than name, but it isn't a substitute for a real index."
4,A Master Letter Writer,"Groucho Marx is known for his letter writing. This collection is great, but not as good as The Groucho Letters. Since these are only to his daughter, Miriam, they don't reflect aspects of his personality that show up in The Groucho Letters, which are collected from diverse people, family, friends, and other show people, not to mention Warner Brothers during a law suit.But I love this collection because Groucho comes across as a loving and concerned parent who can't get enough of his children. He is supportive, generous, thoughtful and witty."
3,Originally from Zaire/DRC,"The real sounds are originally from Zaire. They settled in Zimbabwe in the 1970s and have been based there ever since. Nowadays,they sing mostly in shona( One of the languages of Zimbabwe.)"
5,Finaly an outstanding problems and solutions guide,The only way to study mathematics is by solving a large number of problems: this book permits the eager student to challenge his acquired knowledge. A must to all the students wanting to really master undergraduate analysis.
5,Hi!,"""look at this this, at every turn is not even good enough for a picture on amazan"" i hear you say, but no even though this band is now defuncted there music will always stay with me, the not katies were a quite an underground band on deck cheese records, but one of the best i'd say. Many people would just say "" there just another pop punk band"" but believe me there not, they are very melodic and great to skate to lol. There most fmous song is ""2 halves of 2"", but they whole album is amazing from start to finish, this record has no fillers atol, you can listen to the whole thing without getting bored after track 3. If you get a chance although i think this cd ill be very hard to find please pick up a copy!"
5,Speed stacks,my child began playing these in gym and wanted a set for herself. She was very good at speed stacking.
3,Hunters Specialties Deluxe Quad Call Lanyard,"I'm rating this 3-stars (average). I would not call it ""Deluxe"", as what is in it's title description. It works for the price, nothing more, nothing less."
3,Adequate,"Good length, and holds all my calls. The only criticism is that all the lanyard loops originate at the same point, which forces all the calls to hang in the same place - they knock together constantly. If this isn't a qualm for you, then this is a buy. Thick and sturdy material and braid."
4,"Classic old, so good!",This is a classic and so good. It's an easy listen with a good mix of slow and fast tempo. Marks is just so good on his guitar. Seaview Drive is the best of the bunch and a standard for smooth jazz.
5,"A ""Must Have"" for college dorm rooms","We have 4 kids and got our first Hot Shot when they all lived at home. We love it and use it almost everyday. It became the ""must have"" for college item as each of them went off to college over the last 7 years. We just bought the last one for our youngest who is going to college this fall. We've also bought them for graduation gifts for friends and general family gifts - they are greatly appreciated and used. Wish Amazon would buy these in bulk and make them available for free shipping ; )"
5,Sharp and sturdy,I bought these to trim my cat's butt hair. They are extremely sharp and get the job done quickly (leaving me with less scratches).
4,EXCELLENT PRODUCT,"Very sharp, light weight, soft feel to it, i gave it 4 stars just because its a bit small and doesn't come with a case or something to put it in, other than that it's an excellent product"
1,"For me, worthless","Way too small. Pretty much worthless. And cost too little to return. Look much better in photo, than in real life. A waste of money. Spend the money for decent size. This is a waste."
2,Tweezerman Spirit 2000 no replacement for my identical looking Hoffritz shears,"I had a pair of Hoffritz shears that were appx. 20 years old and the plastic finger loops were broken and it made using them difficult.I had used them often to clip nose and ear hairs with great ease and comfort. I was in search of a new pair and chose the Tweezerman Spirit 2000 because they look identical. I know they are not made for clipping nose hair but I had hoped they would do a good job and chose to buy this expensive item. For the price they have let me down in that the quality cannot manage cutting nose hairs without damaging the nose tissue. As someone who uses buzzer shears to cut my hair short, the Tweezerman is utterly useless for my needs. I wonder if they would even be good for cutting nomal hair."
2,Made for tiny fingers,"I'm male,6 foot and 200 pounds and I couldn't get my fingers in those tiny openings if my life depended on it. What were they thinking ? I guess they would be Ok if you were a very small person."
1,Not worth a penny,"I bought these to cut for 4 year old son's hair. They are dull and do not cut his hair worth a darn. They pull his hair and do not come close to any of the other reviews I read that rated above a 3. As my son just said, ""I hate this scissors."""
3,the same name but different scissors,"I had scissors and I wanted to give to my son the same one. I ordered the same name, but this is more thick."
3,"Good shears, but not sure...","I'm not sure if these shears are sharp/professional grade enough to get a totally clean cut. They seem like it, but I still end up with split ends pretty soon.They are better than using regular scissors though."
5,"Very Sharp, high quality. Cannot go wrong","Super sharp, and very fine for reaching small places. The steel feels very hard, probably a high carbon steel. worth what i paid"
2,Silence...,"This is a silent film. I read that it's one of the best. I seen some of it. And graphics wise it's good. There are two movies on one disc. And the first one is really old, 1905. It's ok. The second one is better in picture, and there are words to be read not annoying so. But often. Great acting. If I could I wouldn't by this one again. Yet, I am a half glass full kind of person and the music is good very short for a little over an hour. It's what they did back then. I would look for a better one if I were you."
3,I expected at least subtitles. Nothing. Just a silent film.,I can't believe anyone compared this film to Mel Gibsons film.This is an old film without words. My opinion. The 5 starratings must not have bought this film.
3,Cool clog but hard to wear,"I purchased this sweater clog for myself. The shoes are mostly comfortable and look great with jeans. My complaints about the product are as follows; the shoe was very comfortable but hard to keep on your feet when walking any distance especially up stairs. Eventually, because I liked the shoes so much, I sewed cloth straps around the heels of the shoe to keep it on my foot. After doing this, they stayed on quite well but the base of the shoe is wood and very hard on the ball of your foot. After wearing it for 5 or so hours, my toes were going numb. I would recommend that the manufacturer design straps for this clog and also a cusioned sole for better support."
2,t-shirt,"Unfortunely,my new Military T-Shirt was not prefect - the logo (US Navy) was off-center - the ""Y"" below logo was off."
2,"Not the greatest, but has some merit for teaching","I bought this book as a teaching tool for some of my beginning students, since I have one that wants to go rock, one classical, and one jazz. The arrangement for Fur Elise was a nice piece for a quick-learning beginner to study accidentals, and the arrangements for ""All the Things You Are"" and ""Misty"" have been helpful in beginning some jazz studies. Otherwise, I agree that a lot of the arrangements are off, and while there is a large variety of songs, I find that there are a lot of them that I would not have chosen for a book that presumes to call itself ""The Greatest"". As a teacher, though, there are a few things in here that I have found useful...although, I would prefer that the book didn't have tablature."
1,Do not buy this book,"This book is a total waste of money. maybe one out of the 100 songs included in this book is right. The chord listings are way off, and the songs sound terrible if u try to play them the way they are in the book. i made the mistake of wasting my time and money ordering this book. Dont be like me learn from my mistake. THIS BOOK IS HORRIBLE!"
4,Greatest Guitar Book,This book was recommended by grandsons guitar teacher. It has a variety of genres and great lessons for the guitar.
3,No Contest,MAX ROACH is BY FAR the better drummer and blows Buddy Rich out of the water. Rich has energy and only that. Roach is the smarter musician. Don't be a seventh grader.
2,Skims the surface AND it's out-dated!,"This travel book was very disappointing. The book is broken out by neighborhood but does a very poor job organizing the information, particularly if you don't want to follow their guide step-by-step. Directions were off and the restaurant information was way out-dated, which is a definite no-no for a foodie's paradise like Hong Kong. That said, if this is your first time to HK and you have no idea how or where to begin, this might prove handy. If you're looking to really explore the neighborhoods and learn about the culture, consider your options."
1,Not very good,"I used this on a trip to both Hong Kong and Macau with my adult son. It's ok for a basic guide, but it wasn't very helpful. I tossed it out when I checked out of the hotel."
5,Insight City Guide Hong Kong: Macau & Guangzhou,"This book gives ou a nice overview of the region for visiting HK, Guangzhou and Macau."
5,traditional and pioneering,"The Sebo Ensemble first became known in the 1970s in Hungary where they inspired the revival of the tanchaz (dancehouse) movement showing that Hungarian folk music can be exciting and beautiful in modern times as well. They play on traditional and almost forgotten instruments such as the hurdy-gurdy, the jewsharp, the the lyre, and the zither, (some of which were last popular in the middle ages:). The first half of the album is made up of folk songs - some are quite lively and dance-able; the second half is music composed by the band and set to poems, but is equally good material. Whether you're a fan of Eastern European or World Music, or you're just looking for something to bob your head to, this is a great album."
3,Harold Lamb: The Crusades,"The hardcover Crusades by Harold Lamb is is good shape.However, I was disappointed that it did not include ""The Sword of Islam"" as does my paperback copy I bought this to replace."
5,Waking up to the world,"This is one of most beautifully written memoirs I have ever read (and I read a lot). Lane's poetic language, his mastery of scene, the dance between concrete detail and lyrical lushness all work together to create a moving journey for the reader. If you appreciate language and the healing lessons of nature and can respect the courage it takes to back at your life with honesty and acceptance,you will love this transcendent,important book."
5,Bud Heavys,"Matt Dengler used to drink beers with these guys, but he has no idea who the Glassjaw is. Never heard of Strife, Vison of Disorder or Skycamefalling."
4,Heavy riffed songs,"I first downloaded this group with a bunch of others when mp3.com was offering .06$ for every download to a groups song. It was most of this album back in 2000. Just bought this album recently and presently surprised at the other songs I did not already listen to. I like the whole album, the riffs are hard the sound overall is deep and heavy. Some would like to say another Korn knock-off but I really don't think so, the sound is more riffy and punctuated than Korn and the singers exchange numerous times in song and from song to song. Only one album to their credit that I know of but to me it is a good purchase for that time period of 1999-2001. I give it four stars for good riffs, decent vocals, vocal switching, and some real knock your socks heavy moments."
3,EA has screwed a good thing up again!,"Overall it's a good game that keeps you wanting to play the next mission. It's also fairly difficult which is a good thing (I usually have to play each level twice before beating it). But BEWARE, EA has not done their quality assurance checks again (as in the major malfunctions with the Madden 06 for PSP game). This game has often froze up and turned my PSP off right in the middle of a mission. So frustrating... I smell Class Action! I'm about to boycott EA games. Well, if you want to keep playing this game, please remember to save often!"
4,Good Looking Fast-Paced Tactics Game,"For a tactics type game, this one has bigger, better looking, more realistic graphics than most. Because enemy and hero units move simultaineously, and it is simpler than most tactics games, it is faster paced than most as well. It features skills/spells and items similar to ""LOTR - The Third Age"", which must be purchased in-between battles. All ""Heros"" gain experience from each battle, even if they were not in it. Not a game for purists, if you would like to battle it out as LOTR Heros with a horde of Orcs in turn-based combat, you'll like it.The only downside is that the game consists of battles only, there are no story line descisions to direct the course of the game. It does feature clips from the LOTR movies that introduce each battle, but they really do not give the game a feeling of continuity.I am basically comparing this to FF Tactics and similar games. I would hesitate to call it an RPG."
4,"Great Device, but UPDATE THE BIOS!","At first I was having many problems - wouldn't sync, loss of or wouldn't connect to a WIFI signal, and the battery seemed to get rundown VERY fast. I found myself having to do soft resets on the device almost daily. I tried to use HP's website to update the BIOS, but after 3 days of trying the ones listed, which gave me ""wrong model"" errors, I called HP and discovered the right one for the hx2795b was not listed out there! So they gave me the exact ftp link to the update: ftp://ftp.compaq.com/pub/softpaq/sp33001-33500/sp33003.exe Paste this into your browser on your PC and then run it. Once I completed the update, the device has been working great!!My only other ""con"" is that the Manual leaves much to be desired. This device is more of a ""figure-it-out-as-you-go"" device, which may prove frustrating for some."
4,HP iPAQ hx2795 Pocket PC,"I've been using this Pocket PC for about 2 months. I initially had a lot of trouble with lockups and was ready to return it for a refund after the first week. After 4 hard reboots in one day I decided to turn off all security, including the finger print recognition, and that seems to have resolved most of the lockup problems. Now it locks up less then once a week and a soft reboot clears it, I can live with that. A few times when the unit was powered off the battery run down overnight. Hardware wise, the product is well made as I would expect from HP. The software needs improvement. The programs I have installed all work well and it satisfies all my intended purposes. Overall I am pleased with it and expect to continue using it for a long time."
5,This PDA is very cool,This PDA is very cool. It syncs well with my Microsoft Outlook and my VPN. It holds all the software that I need so far. I am having fun with it.
1,piece of garbage,"I bought mine almost 1 year ago, trying to improve my old (but good) Dell Axim X5, and after using the warranty 4 times, (because the one I bought was overheating when it was Off) first they replaced the battery, then the equipment (twice) and the IPaQs continue overheating, with no technical explanation from HP. Now they offered me an ""Improvement"" to my original choice (the IPaQ 210) but these guys are so smart that sent me only the new IPaQ (210) with no battery, cables, Installation CD, stylus, etc. (the 2795 and the 210 are quite differents in the accessories) this was almost 1 month ago and they are still playing games with me. Conclusion: after 1 year of purchasing the IPaQ I could use it properly around 1 month. My worst experience as Client.... I will go back to DELL."
4,Ipaq,"I have used an IPAQ for years and certainly this one works more efficiently and faster that the former. My only disappointment is that it is not running Windows Moble Six. It uses five which lacks some of the features. Still, it is a good product."
4,"Love it, worth every penny","I've had this device since April 2007. Twenty months later it is still going strong. I let it sit for several months without powering it up and was sure that the battery would be completely dead, but nope. It charged up to full power and has held the charge just as well as when it was new. I use it to keep track of my classes, check my email on the run, and various other tasks. It is a lot more convenient than trying to pull out my laptop to do that stuff. Recently I got into geocaching and I am also using it for that. I have a program called diet organizer that lets me track my weight and calories, as well.I use this little device a lot more than I thought I would, and it has held up very well. I've dropped it a few times (mostly onto carpet) without causing any damage.This is my second PDA and it is far superior to my old one. When the time comes to replace it I will definitely be looking at other HP models."
4,"So Far, So Good!","I purchased and received my iPAQ hx2795 pocket PC nearly two weeks ago and have been happy with it so far. My Palm Treo, although it served me well for several years, died on me and I was looking to upgrade to a device that didn't include a cell phone. I've had none of the problems that many other reviewers have experienced except for the device coming on by itself after I shut it off. This only happened a few times after the HP ProtectTools loaded. I have Windows XP at work and VISTA at home and the device syncs well to my work PC and the Wi-Fi (once I figured out how to connect) works well through my home network. I'm still learning and playing around with my iPAQ, but am happy I made the purchase so I heartily recommend it for those who want to stay organized and be mobile."
3,Another New Coke?,"This is the closest model to my old iPaq (2200 series) which finally just wore out physically (still functioned fine). This one doesn't seem to have the handwriting feature for notes which I really miss. The display screen is very crisp with vivid color and the battery lasts much longer than the old model.I am experiencing considerable issues with hot syncing with Outlook 2007. Earlier versions work fine. If this coordination is critcal for you and you're using Outlook 2007, you would probably do well to spare yourself the grief and choose a different pocket PC.The built-in hard plastic screen cover is a nice touch and I have not felt the need to purchase the optional carrying case for protection."
4,A little moving office,"This product combine great design, technology, and versatility to organize your office, little business, and some home subjects. I love the wireless internet connection and the Bluetooth, also the big screen, in order to enjoy some videos, and the sound is not so bad if you use the stereo output.I think is a great option instead of the expensive pocket PCs with a QWERTY Keyboard if you want to feel a Windows atmosphere and if you want to combine it with a notebook."
4,iPAQ hx2795 review,"I'm a pharmacy intern and use my device mostly for checking drug-drug interactions or as a drug reference. I think it's user friendly, but it might have too many features for what I use it for. I've had a problem with a portion of my screen freezing up/not displaying icons it should - these fix themselves upon reset. If you do get this product, I recommend getting the case that goes with it."
3,It's ok. Not as good as the Axim.,"I had an Axim before I bought this iPaq. Unfortunately it was stolen and they don't make them anymore, so I bought this as a replacement. The main feature of the iPAQ I use is the fingerprint security. Basically if it gets stolen, I can be sure my info will not be retrieved without my fingerprint. I've had one big problem with my iPAQ though. My speaker doesn't seem to be working, or works infrequently. I use it as a GPS device as well, and this is a major malfunction when the speakers no longer dictate directions. I have to use the headphone jack along with my car adapter to get it to use my car speakers instead."
3,4 out of five,"I had a palm tungsten t3 prior to my new hp and I really liked it. The hp is good, but its windows ce os takes up a lot of space and doesn'tallow me to do everything I could do before. I've become used to the limitations however, and so far things are working out well. I wish palm had continued to support the t3. I would have had mine fixed instead of paying a rather high price for more windows programs I really didn't want or need."
4,Solid performer,"I've been using this as a development platform for a few weeks (winmobile) and I have to say it works pretty nicely. It can be difficult to figure out how to configure certain aspects of the device (e.g. networking, sync modes, etc), but usually a little google searching will get you an answer. My only complaint is that the device isn't running winmobile 6. Other than that, this is a solid PDA."
3,Made Men for DVD,"The only reason I bought this movie is because of all the hype around it(Richard Donner and Joel silver produced it). These guys have done some of the best action movies to date(The Matrix, Lethal Weapons). So I couldnt resist seeing this movie. However this was a entirely differnt type of movie. The acting was good, and the story was decent, but dont be fooled by the hype around it, there are only two big shootouts in the entire movie, which was disapointing coming from Donner and Silver. There wasnt even a big action scene between the villian and good guys. You would think they could come up with a better climax! Any how the movie is entertaning and is good enough to put in your action video collection. P.S. This movie has great picture quality and its anamorphic widescreen!"
3,"if your going to steal,don't get caugh.","pretty good movie and lots of action.i like james belushi in almost everything.but stealing from your boss is not a good idea to start with,but when it's 12 mil.,and he'a gangster.that can be the kiss of death."
2,Another shoot em up,"Lots of shooting. Two black guys. Two Brits (one playing a Southern sheriff). One fast-talking con. One backwoods SOB who has a lucrative drug operation. They all chase each other all over the place, shooting and killing and stuff.That's about it."
1,SCARLET,\\THIS TAPE WAS VERY BAD HAD PRINTING AND WRITING ALL THRU IT HAVE WRITEN SUPPLER 3 TIMES BUT HAVE GOTTEN NO ANSWER BACKAM SURE THE STORY WAS GOOD BUT TAPE WAS IMPOSSBLE TO WATCHWANT TO ADD THAT I HAVE HEAR FROM SUPPILER AND HAVE GREATFUL GOTTEN A REFOUND THANK YOU
2,Don't be in a hurry . . . product less than perfect . . .,"I ordered the urtext edition of Mozart Sonatas and Three Fantasias on December 26, 2009. I received it January 26, 2010. There was no explanation why it took a month to ship.Also, some of the music print is missing above the first line: top of Sonata 3 page 24, for example. But since I really do need this music to make a deadline, I will accept it rather than risk months of waiting for a perfect copy.Considering the snail's pace with no explanation and less than perfect (new) product, there is no way I can give a stellar review and rating. Sorry."
3,So-so romantic suspense novel,"This is a forced-companionship romance, meaning that the two wildly opposite leads (Lauren, a concert pianist and Sam, an FBI agent)are forced to stay together under somewhat implausible circumstances. This book is an easy read, but I felt that Lauren's character (being a child prodigy) should have been somewhat smarter. She tells Sam at one point that she can't drive or cook. You'd think that hanging around highly educated people (you know, the ones who attend piano concertos) would have rubbed off on her. She's also completely unaware that her mentor Carlo is a crime boss, which is a plot point so ludicrous that it defies explanation. Seriously, anyone who's watched ""GoodFellas"" could have figured it out.With the exception of Lauren's dumb as dishwater characterization, the book is pretty good; the plot moves along swiftly and the action is as good as any standard thriller novel."
4,WOMAN IN JEOPARDY!,"This is my first Ginna Gray book and I would read another. Fast paced woman in jeopardy book. On the run with alpha male Rawlins, Lauren (who has been sheltered all of her life) must cope with surviving and her growing attraction to her protector. Good story and plot, but I found Lauren's constant questioning of Rawlins' motives and actions irritating. After all, he's the professional. That aside, I would recommend the book. A MUST read is LAUREN BACH's sexy and thrill a minute ""LONE RIDER"". WOW! A five plus read. Check it out!!"
1,It is not ATOMIC its just a BOMB.,A very disappointing collection from verve.Particulary two tracks with the mushy organ sound have the ambiance of a holiday inn lounge.very difficult to get through those tracks.Stay with classic Basie and avoid this hodge podge.If you like the basie sound you will be dissapointed.
4,Ruth Wallis Straight Forward,"Big fan of Ruth Wallis' comedy material. However when she goes straight, there's some kind of falter in her vocals. I recommend this for the completist and glad to have it in my collection. Now lets release her comedy material."
4,Good,"Three CD set of piano music.Long,austere improvisations remindingrenaissance organ playing.The Second Part is especially fine.Recommended!"
3,Bizzare stuff from the Bus man,"This is one of the Bus man's strangest films. Our man, for reasons never made clear, is known as ""Friendless"" and is so despised that when he puts his arm around a dog, the dog walks away in disgust. Following Horace Greely's famous saying ""Go west young man,"" he does that and even though he can't milk a cow or saddle a horse, somehow gets a job as a cowhand. Still abused by all of mankind, he does an ""androcles and the lion"" bit (as he did in ""Three Ages"" with a lion) with a cow named ""Brown Eyes"" and and last finds a friend. I'll let you see the rest for yourself. But this is really strange stuff, and the ending (""I Want her."" You'll see what I mean.) will leave a particularly odd taste in your mouth."
4,ROMANCE OF THE TWINS - CAPTIVATING!,"Opps! a loveless marriage? Does it work?Mac McKenna had his own reasons for a marriage of business partners. He is a high-powered lawyer with work as his cure-all.Jenna Taggert was a lawyer with an eye to the main chance. Prestige, security, glamor, no children. A marriage made in heaven?Trouble began when Jenna flew the coop and asked her twin, Jessie, to step in for the bridal fitting - then there was the Charity gala - the office party and the reharsal dinner. Jenna remained incomunicado [for the time being].Until Mac's ultimatim.Jessie Taggert wasn't prepared for all the strings that came attached with this innocent ruse. Nor was Mac prepared for the sudden charge to his hormones. Oh, Oh, Jessie felt the same charge. Oh, the danger of those dang hormones.The Taggert parents weren't much help. And trouble just kept escalateing - it was that darn kiss.Definitely recommended - a delightful story with great results."
5,A winner,"If you've ever read the Power Broker, if you've ever read The Boys of Summer, if you are curious about that postwar period that shaped the country, if you like baseball, then this is required reading. Fast pace, good background on the politics and personalities, a gripping pennant race. Elegantly vivid sentences like the one describing how at one point the politicos had a plan for a Jetson-like Brooklyn; the author said it could have been something that Robert Moses and Josef Stalin drew up together on a cocktail napkin."
3,Suspenseful Thriller,"Cloris Leachman, the real star of this film, plays a housewife from a family that appears to be upper middle class family. She is called to serve on Jury Duty and eagerly accepts. She does this for she feels that it is her right to make sure justice is served.The real suspense starts when her excitement turns into suspicion, then fear, as she discovers the truth about the case. That the defendant is innocent, she knows who the real murderer is, and the murderer knows she is on the jury. This is a decent TV thriller of yesteryear and worth watching one afternoon."
2,Quality could be better,It was dark and cloudy at times. Not the greatest buy. I am very disappointed. Can I return for a refund?
1,Stop Making Sense,"I loved Stop Making Sense when I saw it in the cinema many years ago. Unfortunately, the DVD cannot be played on our DVD player (Sony PlayStation 2) and I had to return it to the shop for a refund. The shopkeeper said dozens of copies had been returned because the DVD is incompatible with several different DVD players. Why make a DVD that cannot be viewed by all normal machines? The irony is that this DVD is distributed in Canada by Sony Music and cannot be played on a Sony PS2."
1,consider me UNSATISFIED,"I loved ""Stop Making Sense"" when it hit the movie theaters back in the mid 80's. I was Very Disappointed with the DVD. It Was Not the movie !! It was all this bogus and unnecessary commentary laid over a classic piece of performing arts. The ceaseless drivel totally ruined this classic live music performance. I would Very Much like to get the Original Movie & not this dubbed nonsense. I am very unsatisfied."
5,Maybe later...,"David Byrne self-interviews himself nice. It's good to feel nice. You laugh. The video will make you good to feel nice...and then cry. Because you feel video to feel nice. Does anybody have any questions? I have a tape to play for you...To feel nice. Do you know what I'm trying to say? Thanks, Toe Knee"
3,"Would Be Brilliant, Except....","I purchased this DVD and had to return it because I thought that it had a manufacturing defect. The first 4 tracks did not have the audio and video synched. The second copy of the DVD also was not in synch on the first 4 tracks. Since all of my other DVD's play perfectly, it seems unlikely that my DVD player is the source of the problem. I can forgive the bonus tracks being poorly transferred, but I can't forgive the second-rate, bush-league, synching on the first 4 tracks of the movie. What a let down. Didn't anybody else have this problem????"
5,Great Stuff,You won't find a better DVD that is focused on a concert than this one. Those people in the audience were very lucky to have been there for this concert.
5,Slippery people,"This movie holds up very well over time. I saw the movie in '85 in a theatre in the Back Bay of Boston and was bowled over. It is amazing to see the raw energy of David Byrne and the gang. Byrne goes solo on ""Pshycho Killer,"" bringing out his band one member at a time, hitting full stride on ""Slippery People."" He has added more percussion and some nubile back up singers to give even more umphh to the music. Each band member reveals his or her own character with Tina Weymouth taking the lead on one selection from The Tom Tom Club. Remember them? This is one of the most satisfying concert films I've seen. Jonathan Demme really knew how to capture the kinetic energy of David Byrne. The back stage graphics add to the post-modernist feel of this intellectual punk band, which was a big part of the CBGB scene."
5,Still Rockin' After All These Years!,"Saw this when it premired in a local theater and stuck around to see it two more times! Bought the VHS tape when it came out and later the DVD. The BEST filmed rock-n-roll concert by far! I remember dancing in the isles untill my feet gave out! If you are one of the few out there who haven't seen it, buy it! You won't be disapointed!"
4,"Good show, but not their best tour","I wish someone could have filmed a performance from the Remain in Light tour, which was much stronger than the Stop Making Sense tour. The latter does lend itself well to filmed performance, and this is a great film nonetheless. I saw both tours, and the energy and songs on the Remain in Light tour were far better."
5,Talking Heads in their Prime!,Saw this in the theater when it came out back in the 80s-- just watched it last night and it seems as fresh as it was back then. A must see for all fans of David Byrne and the Talking Heads!!
5,Talking Heads Live,"This is probably in the top 5 of all of my Concert CD's. I really wasn't getting too excited about this performance until the third or fourth song when the members of the band started blending in. A couple of major performances stood out for me. First of all, in my mind, David Byrne is one of the top vocalists and showmen in all of music. His enthusiasm while performing these songs was mesmerizing. He had such great rhythm while dancing to various tracks that it kept you locked in on him most of the show. The other highlight that really struck me was the performance by the two girls that sang background during the show. They both had great voices and moved extremely well to every tune. The rest of the band were more than competent on various instruments. In short, I would highly recommend this DVD."
5,Converted me to the Talking Heads!,"I was never a big TH fan. A co-worker in the 80s, when the band was active used ""Burning Down The House"" as his answering machine message, and I just thought he, and the band, were on the fringe.This movie changed my mind forever. I can't stop watching it. I think I've watched it every week-night since I bought it. The band's fantastic: not a punk or fringe band, but an extremely creative blender of lots of influences (not least Al Green), including Afro, synthesizers, and creative (3) percussionists. And they perform with a dramatic choreography, using visual effects and with an enthusiasm that was totally unanticipated.The movie has to be seen to be genuinely appreciated, my words can't convey its specialness. I highly recommend it."
5,Why God Invented DVD...,"...and reviewers like me. You will toss that ol' worn out ""Stop Making Sense"" audio CD away and wanna see all your favorite performances on DVD. This came out in eightysomething, but with all the reprocessing and remastering, it sounds and looks great, the editing is excellent and by the time it gets to the Tom Tom Club performance and the big suited ""Girlfriend is Better"" you'll be outta your seats dancing to the music, guaranteed. Love Al Green's ""Take Me To the River"". Get it on DVD, now! (PS, For true funkateers it also shows P-funk keyboardist Bernie Worrell in action)."
4,James Cotton - great anthology,In short - this is solid blues from a great performer. 20 tracks and a good mix
5,blue blows (but sure don't suck!),"one of the most lyrical, poetic minds in jazz improvisation, in this reporter's humble opinion-- great, round, chimey, bell-like tone, and serious 12 bar blues chops-- if anybody plays prettier, i don't know who it would be, and i sure wish you would introduce me-- a must-have addition to any serious (or fun) jazz collection-- this one is a no-brainer!"
5,Shiney Rack,I love the rack! Glass jars are nice and the SS really looks good. The spices selection is ok. I wish they would have had whole bay leaves instead of crushed. But I can aways refill with whatever I like and put a new sticker on the top. I would definitely purchase again.
2,Kamenstein 16-Jar Stainless-Steel Spice Tower,"Item arrived w/two broken caps (which have the name printed on top to identify the spice). It might be possible to obtain replacement caps at a local hardware store, but not w/the names printed on them. It was wrapped, but the hard plastic caps were broken because they are not subtantial (as in the caps/lids for the bottles of spices purchased in the grocery stores)- just thin, black plastic caps. Would not recommend this item - not a quality product."
4,I use the spices..,"this looks great on my countertop, and I use the spices, some people have said they didn't use them. Some of the spices I've never heard of and may never use, so you could exchange them out for your own. I like it! IT looks sharp."
4,Looks cool.. spices are not useful to someone to a novice like me,This looks good in any kitchen i wouold assume. Even more so if you have a black or stainless steel theme going on.. As far as the quality of the spices I cannot remark as I am not experienced enough with them. I have used all of the italian mix and parsley but everything else seems to require Iron chef level knowledge to know what it would be good for. Well not the bay leaves or seasoned salt but you can always fill it with what you want.It is what it is and for the price why complain.. mine did come with a small obvious dent in the metal likely from shipping.
4,Great little helper,"The Helping Hands/ Magnifying glass is a big help when trying to hold something small--like jewelry--and work on it. I modified mine a bit by moving one of the arms so that instead of the magnifying glass being in the middle, it's on the end. Since everything can be slid around, the magnifying glass can still be over what I'm working on, and I have the 'hands' close enough together to hold smaller things. I also put a strip of electrical tape around the clips to put a little protection between them and what I'm holding, so there's no risk of scratching what I'm working on. The base is surprisingly heavy so I can use it for anything small enough to fit on there and balance. The one other thing it could use is a light--to me that would give it a 5 out of 5 rating. It was very inexpensive, and worth way more than it cost. I'm very pleased with the purchase and will recommend it to my friends."
4,Such a unique item,"When I bought this magnifyer I knew I was getting a functional tool. I bought it for what it does, and it does that. But when I pulled it out of the box I realized that, in addition to function, it served as a unique display item on my desk. It really looks neat. In fact, it was so interesting to look at that my daughter, who isn't interested in tools at all, asked me to keep it in her room on a shelf. It works as advertised and it's a great conversation starter."
4,Its like having an extra pair of hands with claws!,"The Helping hands is a pretty awesome tool. I saw this thing on an online video and thought they looked cool and would help with my painting projects and purchased it from amazon, its even cooler in person. My only issue is that I wish it had extra clamps, but I guess I can purchase the claps seperately."
3,Good for cables. Not much else...,"A lot of people recommend this for PCB work. I have found that it scratches PCB's, and doesn't hold them up very well. I use some small spring clamps clipped into to the clips it comes with, it keeps them from scratching whatever I'm working on. If you are going to be doing PCB, you should probably get a Panavise Jr. This product is really good for making cables though. It's good for clipping a connector into one end, and the wire into the other. The magnifying glass is difficult to use while soldering, but it might be better for other uses. You also can't get it far enough away to really see anything."
4,The Son/Husband's perspective,I read this book in order to understand my troublesome triangle. It was very informative and insightful. I was amazed at how much each chapter significantly related to the events which are unfolding in my life. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who needs advice on how to balance the relationship between these three people.
1,wasted money,"I am restricted to a wheelchair, and so must rely on grabbers,to assist me when reaching for things in higher areas or across wide spacess. I already had one of the ergonomically 18' grabbers in this style and really liked the light wt. and dexterity it allowed me, over many of the other styles. So, I was very disappointd when after the THIRD time I used it, I heard a click and part of the internal workings actually came through the handle, Now, it just takes up space while I try to see if I can get my money back. Needless to say, I am aggeivated and dissapointd. DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
2,Argh,"Lots of basic, common-sense advice. Low score because book spends a deal of time cross-plugging other Haldane books and promoting their consultant services. I'd say the book is a good buy to get you motivated and remind you of do's and don'ts before an interview."
5,another gotta have album,"This is another gotta have album (CD). The vibe, the musicians, the ensemble, wow. All the reviewers are absolutely spot on."
4,Good instrumental hymns-No signing,"If you are looking for song, you won't find it here. If you like the instrumental aspect, it's a great CD, worth listening to."
4,Availability,"If Amazon is out of stock and you don't want to pay the crazy used/collector price, check out the This American Life store to pick up a copy at a more reasonable price. :-)"
5,The basics by the best,"The team at ""This American Life"" tell stories as well as anyone in the media. This book was recommended to me during a seminar on multimedia storytelling for photographers, so its value is not limited to those who only want to do radio. It's a comic book, but not shallow. Anything but. Ira Glass and his team at Chicago Public Radio go through how a particular week's show, Do-Gooders, was produced as well as basic tip for anyone wanting to do documentary audio work. This is a little gem."
5,Illuminating,"The use of the comic book medium to portray the production of one episode TAL is uniquely informative. Not only does this book explain the essence of TAL, it also inspires the reader to sinthesize TAL with his/her own ideas to bring thoughtfull brodcasting to local radio."
2,IT HAS NOTHING TO DO ABOUT SPYING,"This is not an espionage thriller as the cover and title of this book would have you beleive. The vast majority of the content in this book is about how two people working in the CIA fall in love with each other and how they are so excited being around one another. I for one, and i think most people would agree, think that someone who would buy this book would be interested in the CIA and the history of the cold war. This book has nearly nothing to do with either of those subjects! Their are some good parts to this book but they are overshadowed by a love story. This book would be better catogorized as a romance novel!"
2,Spy versus Spy comic strip cowboys,"Interesting memoirs from the ""CIA spies' make-up artists:"" Antonio and Jonna Mendez. Most interesting to me was the (perhaps unintended) sub-text about the dysfunctional management and leadership of the CIA's clandestine services--bosses from hell, unconscionable working hours and conditions (in DC, not to mention overseas), rampant brainless cowboyism, Spy versus Spy comic strip idiocy. Sidney Riley must be spinning in his grave. ""The Company"" had a long reputation for treating women badly and this book helps us see why 800+ female employees sued CIA for discrimination and won. Whether these two CIA vets, or the CIA itself, had anything to do with winning the Cold War is by no means shown in this book. The pictures are worth a look."
3,Spy Dust by a former CIA operative,"I find this story better suited to hard copy. I needed to back track, refer back a lot and, for me, would have found it much easier to have the paper pages to flip rather than trying to bookmark. Interesting story though."
3,memoirs?,I had a very difficult time getting through this one. The writing was rather dry. I think it would have been better if written by someone other than the participant in this case.
2,Editor badly needed.,"If you purchase this book expecting to experience an exciting behind the scenes look at the shadowy world of international espionage, be forewarned. The authors spend many, many pages interweaving their personal love lives into the narrative. Personally, I was not that interested in reading how the female protagonist fell in love with her boss and left her husband (in that order). Too much writing about how the male protagonist's teeth ""flashed in the sunlight"" and not enough about the how's and whys of their respective trades."
3,Just skip over the personal stuff - it's a good read,"I found this book interesting, especially the set ups (help from Hollywood, lots of practice runs in Georgetown, etc) needed to attempt to exfiltrate an agent. I just skipped over the parts about their personal relationship (it really didn't belong in the book). It was also chilling and upsetting to read about the people directly affected by Aldrich Ames and Robert Hannsen."
1,Booooriing!,"This book virtually doesn't have a storyline. It is rather a collection of loose narratives of spies walking or driving around cities overseas in the Cold War era. There's nothing new or of interest to historians or anyone interested in surveillance techniques. The only ""Moscow rule"" the authors repeat over and over is ""one is an accident, two is coincidence, three is enemy action"". They took it from Ian Fleming's ""Goldfinger""! C'mon, is ""Goldfinger"" a textbook in the CIA Academy? I doubt so. A lot of ink is wasted on the author's middle age love affair no one is interested about. Read a James Bond novel instead - at least, there's some action besides the love story."
5,a must have,This book have everything you need to know about samurai. many techniques pictures..specially if you're learning koden enshin ryu. katana making detailed pics. i will treasure this book and make it heritage for my son and grandson.
3,"beautiful candles, but not drip free","Disappointed that these dripped to the extent they did. No apparent reason, not exposed to heat. Otherwise, very beautiful candles, but for that price, they should be dripless as advertised in the specs."
3,"Nice, but overpriced","The first one I recieved was badly damaged and it took numerous emails to have another one sent. While this mailbox is nicer than your standard box it is too expensive. I was disapointed that the trim on the front lid is just a plastic piece you attach yourself. I was assuming it was a one piece stamped metal lid. Also, what I thought was an oval brass accent on the lid is just another piece of plastic you stick on. The value is just not there. I would'nt buy this if I had seen one in person."
3,Machine Vision,"This book has a thorough discussion of the topics of computer vision. It starts with the basic elements of computer images and eventually explains stereo images and 3-dimensionality.I would not suggest this book for someone who wants samples of code, because this book does not have any. This book is designed for people interested in the theory of computer vision and can take that theory and apply it themselves. A strong background in math is needed for this book."
5,Very Funny,"Dick is a very funny movie.It's about two dingy blonde girls,played by Michelle Williams and Kirsten Dunst,(they are hilarious)who end up exposing the Watergate scandel.The rest of the cast,including Dan Hedaya as Dick,is very funny,too.The soundtrack is very good.Overall,this is a very good movie,and a lot funnier than many other comedies these days."
4,Funny satire of Watergate,"This is a very enjoyable movie, though young people might be lost at its many references. My favorite scene must be the one where one of the girls reveal to the other the meaning behind the expression Deep Throat, but there are many other great scenes, like when the girls first stumble upon the white house tapes, and reveal to them a Nixon they didn't know. The ending is also superb. What's great about this movie is the overall humor that was sorely missing in ""All the President's Men"" and ""Nixon"": in this film, Woodward and Bernstein are as much objects of ridicule as Nixon and Kissinger."
4,Not bad,"Honestly, comedy and Watergate fits together like drinking and driving. This movie somehow manages to combine those two things in a way thats quite entertaining.Kirsten Dunst (quite good) and Michelle Williams play two 15-year-olds who stumble into the Watergate scandal. This is bareley believable, but good for a few good laughs.""Dick"" is mainly watchable because of the superb performances of Dan Hedaya (as Richard Nixon) and -even better- Saul Rubinek (as Henry Kissinger).If you need something more serious about Watergate, go and see ALL THE PRESIDENT`S MEN, which is more realistic, but not as funny :-)"
2,Highly overrated and really disapointing,This movie was supposed to be a great comedy but it wasn't that funny at all. I thought the idea was really good but it wasn't executed in an effective way. The only laugh came from Dan Hedaya as Nixon. He was great but nothing elsewas really noteworthy about this film which I feel is highly overrated concerning the positive critism it has gotten.
2,"Good Performances, but occasionally irritating","Good Points: Will Ferrell and Bruce McCullough are hilarious as caricatured Woodward and Bernstein, and Saul Rubinek has some great scenes as Kissinger explaining his foreign policy theories to the teenagers. Michelle Williams adds some nice touches as she develops and loses a crush on the president (itself a funny twist of the movie).But some of the actors think they are funnier than they really are. Kirsten Dunst totally overplays the ditziness to irritation (I hate to say it because she has become exceptionally easy on the eyes), and other supporting actors try too hard to steal scenes. Could have been much funnier if you didn't get the impression that the actors kept convincing themselves how gosh-darn funny they are."
5,Hilariously slanted look at history,"This movie is great! Highly entertaining, especially for those of us who even know what Watergate was. Though young at the time, this movie brought the times back in a hilarious fashion. I'm suprised at how many kids in school today have never even heard of Watergate. Maybe this funny look at a twisted history will cause them to look back. Oh yeah, great soundtrack. Peace man!"
2,"Interesting satire, but about 25 years too late","Very mildly amusing political satire that would have been much funnier about 25 years ago. Standout performance by the actor playing Nixon. Hash brownie humor is pretty lame. This film is just not topical. Would have been better right after the Watergate scandal broke. If you STILL perceive Nixon as an icon of 'the establishment', then you might like it. Might as well make a film lambasting Ike Eisenhower - i'm sure it would get the same amount of belly-laughs - none."
3,eeeh..thats all i have to say,"it was a good film, but not one of kirsten dunts's bests. It was funny at some parts, but i guess its point was to be educational in showing us what we remembered from the watergate incident..but i just found it all kind of boring.."
5,One of This Year's Best,I knew I was probably going to love it before I even saw it. This is just one of those deliciosly quirky films that you have to love. I was happy to add it to my list of interesting movies I like and highly recommend. This one won't let you down.
5,Dick,"A hilarious, strictly satirical take on the Nixon White House, ""Dick"" follows the inspired notion that two young teens unwittingly pierced the heart of the biggest scandal in presidential history--without realizing it. Dunst and Williams are endearing as the sweetly clueless teeny-boppers, while character actor Hedaya makes even tricky Dick loveable. Director Fleming never veers into pure parody, opting for a smart, irreverent twist on an iconic cultural moment."
5,Something Original for a Change,"There has been a gradual dumbing down in the movies which Hollywood produces these days. It has gotten to the point where many of them are simply unwatchable. This movie is one of the few exceptions to this trend -- it is original, clever, and funny. The final scene is priceless! Although younger viewers should enjoy it as well, it is a must see for anyone who grew up during the Watergate era. It is a dirty shame that Dick was not a box office success, because it means that Hollywood will only subject us to more Steven Seagal movies and other such dreck."
1,This is for Nixon bashers and junior high girls,"This movie explains the end of the Nixon presidency via two junior high girls. If you're adult, you'll probably find this to be as silly as it is improbable. If you're a young girl, you'll probably notice all of the neat 70's styles, but lose most of the story line (i.e. how many 10-12 are aware of the Nixon stories, cast, etc...).The music was great; the acting wasn't; the scenes were uneventful an unexplained (i.e. all of a sudden the two main characters are in private sections of the white house)....for renters only..."
1,Watergate Mess,"""Dick"" opened at 1,500 cinemas in August and has grossed to-date $6m. In terms of ranking, it ranks 126 of 257 movies for 1999 (but that includes films released yesterday!). It's going to be a long haul recovering its costs! It's difficult to understand for whom this movies is targeted, but if I were to guess, 11 to 15 year old girls is probably not far off. In which case I am the wrong person to give an objective opinion. However, Dan Hedaya does an excellent parady of Anthony Hopkins' role as Nixon, and his scenes offer some levity to a long 2 hours."
1,One of the worst movies of 1999,"It is difficult to say that this was the worst movie ever made, but definetly easy to say that it was one of the worst movies I've seen in 1999. It is amazing to see that the producer of Armageddon sank all of her earnings into this farce. The movie is not only bad, but also annoying. The only good thing about this experience is the fact that I purchased it from another web store and only paid 16.99 vs. the 17.99 asked by amazon.com"
2,Good Idea / Good Cast / Lousy Script.,"What a waste of a great idea and great cast - all the leads give cracking performances and the concept of two ditzy teens getting muddled up with Tricky Dicky's Watergate Scandal is a novel one.However, in order to keep the movie mainstream and dumb enough the poor players are put through a load of lame gags and uninspried set pieces - the level of the humour is way below the 12 certificate the film carries.It's unlikely that the audience this movie is suited to would know the name of current US president, nevermind the complexities of the bungled Watergate break-in!"
2,alright i liked it a little bit,some funny moments are in this movie but often many boring moments concerning presidential stuff and crap like that.the previews were kinda better than the movie but they cut out some of the bad language funny parts so this is worth a rent
2,Long time to receive,I ordered 2 things at the same time. This one came over 2 weeks later than my first.
1,A waste of time,"Maybe I would have liked it more if I was more familar with the Watergate Scandal and that time period, but this movie really annoyed me. Arlene and Betsy were too shallow and stupid to even seem remotely funny to me. They didn't really have any character at all, they just walked around making stupid remarks, and getting really enthusiastic about the president's dog. Arlene was sort of funny though, with her ""crush"". I'm trying to think of nice things to say about this movie, but it had no aptmosphere for me, I mean the sets were nice, but it didn't capture the seventies mood, and it was off the wall unrealistic, to the point of being stupid."
3,Funny Movie...better if you know the history,"To the unfamiliar viewer there is enough to laugh about without any understanding of Vietnam or Watergate. To that end, this movie succeeds as a teen comedy with some cute and talented female leads.However, if you are familiar with ""All the President's Men"" or with ""Nixon"" (Oliver Stone's Conspiradrama), then you will laugh deeply at the parody and the silliness. The Nixon character and the seventies humor are right on target and very, very funny."
4,Great outdoor book,"A good read, gives you a good aspect in history of Alaska Yukon. Shows what it takes to make a good hunt."
4,Looks Like More Than It Is,"I feel this is a good book, I was looking for something to just be sort of a checklist, since I feel it's important to thorough. But I feel that someone who doesn't have experience with such a diverse and complicated machine would not be able to actually read this book and then immediately jump into a restoration project. Simply because this book seems thorough in its length a lot of the complications and intricacies of restoring a car are missing, probably because they wanted to condense it but I feel that this is a perfect reminder of the simple joy of restoring a car and its great for a beginner to see how its simplest form is done and then go out and seek direction from an experienced builder. Hope that wasn't too confusing. :P"
5,A quality purchase,I have been a fan of Count Basie and Arthur Prysock all my adult life. Traditional Jazz is my favorite. I bought this album because I did not have one with the artists performing together. I really enjoy it.
5,A VERY COOL MOVIE!!!,"I waited a little while to see this movie, but it was worth it. I didn't even know what it was about!!!ahaha, but that's NOT THE POINT!!! I DON'T think I need to tell you the plot since the editorial review explains it perfectly well, but rather say that if you have doub that this is indeed a GOOD MOVIE, see it yourslef, sit back relax and *enjoy* the ride, it might get a little bumpy!!! This is a good foreign film, the dubbings okay, could be better, but it doesn't distract from it. If you HATE dubbing you can *always* get the Sub-titles version!!!God Bless ~Amy"
5,Great Christmas CD,"I love this cd and I highly recommend it. You may have heard many Christmas songs but Ella's voice is golden, you can't go wrong, I hope that you'll love it too."
5,Swingin' on a Christmas Star,"No one could swing like Ella and this is one of the most fun Christmas CDs ever made. Even Scrooge and the Grinch would be warmed up by Ella's Christmas cheer. Ella's exuberance permeates throughout. Her versions of Jingle Bells, Sleigh Ride and Frosty the Snowman are a hoot! It doesn't get any better than this!"
4,Mermaid Nightmares,"Great low-budget indy horror film from the 60s inspired by the Val Lewton classic 'Cat People'. Fans of other b/w indy horror flicks like 'Carnival of Souls' should really enjoy it. It stars the great Dennis Hopper ('Giant', 'Easy Rider', 'River's Edge', 'Blue Velvet', etc.) as a naive young sailor named Johnny who falls for a mysterious & beautiful girl called Mora. Mora works as ""Mora the Mermaid"" in a sideshow during the day on a CA Boardwalk. After they become lovers, Johnny discovers that Mora's last two boyfriends mysteriously drowned and soon he starts wondering if Mora is a real mermaid or one of the spooky ""Sea People"".The soundtrack is a mix of great bongo numbers & bad b-movie music, but the real highlight is the eerie atmosphere and great stylized photography. The director tried hard to raise ""Night Tide"" out of the usual b-movie abyss and it shows. Excellent flick!"
5,Something's happening here....,"A haunting, mysterious and magical movie. Marjorie Cameron adds an element of real life magic. Kenneth Anger also had done this when he used her in `The Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome (1954)'. Marjorie Easton also adds to the spell, and Dennis Hopper is wonderful. The carnival is the perfect background for a a plot about fantasy and reality. Filmed at the Santa Monica Pier, Venice and Ocean Park, California, where Anton LaVey played organ at strip joints in the late 1940's. The name Mora is found in many parts of the world as the death aspect of the `Triple Goddess', or Night Mare, or female vampire."
5,Essential viewing for cult movie fans,"I adore this little film . It was obviously made on a shoe string but it offers more entertainment value than many big budget blockbusters. All the players do a grand job and they've all got interesting characters to work with . The two standouts for me , however , are the woman who plays the fortune teller (haven't got her name on me right now) and Gavin Muir as Captain Samuel Murdock. The fact that much of the action takes place at the Santa Monica pier amusement park (?) adds to the film's surrealistic air of fantasy. If you're looking for an excellent , low budget early 60's movie that's really well crafted stick this one in your trolley and proceed straight to the check out. If you like ""Carnival of Souls"" you'll like ""Night Tide"". It certainy goes into my basket of ""Desert Island"" videos. Essential viewing for cult movie fans."
2,The picture does not represent this product,"I ordered this for a project and used the dimensions in the product description. The bit that I received was the correct part number but was a 1/4"" shank with a 3/4"" long double cut cone tip (1/4"" to a pointed tip) which will not work for this project. I still gave it two stars because the quality of the bit and the delivery was on time just wrong."
2,Good but impossible to win,"This game has a great engine, but it is impossible to win. I got the game several months ago and haven't beaten either of the two starting levels once. To top it off, I can't find any cheats."
2,START-UP 2000,"This game is boring and too easy to beat, once u beat it, your probably not going to play it again!"
4,This movie scared the heck out of me as a kid!,"Rented on DVD,still gave me an uneasy feeling.If you've ever seen Dawn of the Dead,give those zombies the ability to drain your lifeforce (turning them back to normal for 2hrs.)and that's what you'll see.Even worse:everyone who's drained,can get up and drain/spread the virus.The dvd has decent quality(I watched on my hdtv, Don't think I'd need thisgraphic movie any clearer than that.Wish that included extras:like a bioon the space vamps,ship and an interview with that Matilda May!"
3,*Okay Movie*,"Not one I will watch again.It was just okay.Maybe if you are in to movies like this.I read the reviews and thought it would be good,but not much to say about it."
4,a new angle on a vampire story,"sick of the typical vampire bite them on the neck story, then if you are into vampires, get this dvd, the special effects are still scary today,the storyline is a little different from normal, but the outcome is stillmuch the same, except its not blood they are after, but something moredeadly, the cast are unknowns but do a creditable job, you will watch it again and again over time, very well done"
5,Lifeforce,"I was very pleased with the first rate copy of LIFEFORCE.Excellent condition.The film itself holds up remarkably well.Special effects are oustanding,story line is engaging and the casting and acting was strong.I am sure that LIFEFORCE would appeal to most any Sci-Fi devotee.Big plus is seeing Patrick Stewart in a small role"
3,A Delicate Balance,"This film is so stupefyingly boring, yet Mathilda May is so stacked. This film explains why there are so few big-budget British sci-fi productions directed by hack American directors. The Brits can do cheesy sci-fi TV wonderfully, but given the money in this film's budget, all reason vanished and we are left with stupid explosions and Steve Railsback holding down Cpt Picard (from Star Trek!) while strange lights circle the room and then everything blows up and papers go flying. And yet Ms. May walks up to a glass wall, it explodes into thousands of pieces, and she walks out, completely naked, and we see her extraordinary butt for three seconds...it's all so unintelligible I still don't know what happened. But Ms. May is completely naked sitting in the air bathed in laser light, and she is so stacked with an angelic face. So I take five stars for Ms. May and 1 star for Mr. Railsback, and divide by 2."
1,SLEEPING BOOBIES ......,"EXCEPT for the still unsurpassed utter seediness of AUDREY MORRIS [Mr. Deltoid from 'Clockwork Orange'] as Sir Percy - this one's quite a hoot in acting class ..... this is HOW NOT to do it on screen and Boys and Girls - we DO have a stellar [pardon that pun] cast] - including Patrick Stewart [mouth to mouthing Steve Railback whitst posessed]; the venerable Frank Finlay [Iago to Oliver's Othello], just too many to mention - it's a hoot watching those guys trying to upstage each other in this futile little blast from a somewhat now dismissed Tobe [Texas Chainsaw Massacre]Hooper.The effects? [Oh Dear, why is everyone floating yet a technician in full frame is on his feet???]One can go on ........ [as for the uncanny Nicole Kidman lookalike ..... startling!]QUARTERMASS is much more fun - this poor alien stepchild is somewhere between them all - but worth a rumble or two ....."
4,Classic Vampire Movie,"This is a vampire movie with classic vampires who are driven by the need. There is no reason and there is no definition. It is all driven by the animal instinct. A vampire with a PhD is not a vampire. Com'on give me a break! This makes this movie quite scary. At the same time, this movie is very sexy, seductive, and very very bloody. The performance from the actors is not that good but the story itself is excellent. The mix of sci-fi and traditional Gothic elements are very well done in this movie.4 stars. Must see."
4,Lifeforce,"A classic 1980's Horror film. It has space vampires, zombies, explosions. Man fighting the unknown. Also Co-staring Patrick Stewart!"
5,"Great Movie, Crummy DVD","Lifeforce is maybe not a great film, but it's a great bit of SF/horror storytelling. Written by the great Dan O'Bannon, it's a fascinating, creepy, engrossing SF take on the vampire mythos. Well-acted, well directed, with just enough logic to keep you hooked, and just enough of a mythic quality to leave you satisfied... this film is a hoot from end to end. It's been compared to the good ol' British Quatermass series, and amply lives up to that noble lineage.Alas, however, the MGM DVD totally fails to do the film justice. Presented in a low-res letterboxed form, it lacks the detail and the punch that the material deserves. Worth seeing as-is, but long overdue for a ""deluxe edition"" anamorphic re-release."
3,Lifeforce!,"Spoilers: You got this guy and the alien who are in love at first sight and you got energy vampires and then you got shapeshifting bat creatures and then she's jumping into human bodies and then London's overrun with zombies and then the guy and&#65279; the alien, back in her old body, meet again underneath her spaceship and he stabs them both which causes them both to be transported up to the ship again. Which means the earth is saved, I take it, but why? What? Why?"
2,Ridiculous from Start to Finish,"A waste of time from the Swiss-cheese plot to the pseudo philosophising. With the special effects now severely dated, there are only two redeeming features to this movie and they are both on the chest of the lead actress."
4,lifeforce wish,very good movie but i'd like to see it come out in widescreen anamorphic or full screen
3,See it to believe it,"Tobe Hooper's (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Poltergeist) wild and imaginitive alien invasion/vampire romp Lifeforce hasn't aged very well to say the least. Steve Railsback plays an astronaut whose botched mission to explore Haley's Comet results in the discovery of life sucking vampires (including a seductive and frequently naked one played by Mathilda May) who soon invade Earth with destructive plans on their minds. For everything that Lifeforce has going for it, it has an equal amount going against it. A good majority of the film is predictable, and Hooper's directing isn't half as imaginitive as it was in the films that made him a horror icon. Despite that though, there's still plenty to hold your interest (the gorgeous May in particular), and Railsback is great, and there's just some perverse thrill in seeing him and Patrick Stewart engage (no pun intended) in some creepily weird moments. On that note alone, Lifeforce is worth checking out."
4,An imaginatively insidious science fiction film,"Toby Hooper's answer to the heavy handed intrusion he had endured at the hands of Steven Spielberg while directing ""poltergeist"" was to make a genuinely scarey science fiction/horror film. That film was ""Lifeforce"" and it remains to this day an ominous,operatic story of space vampires invading Earth. The effects are wonderful and Hooper's actors dive into the material with relish. The pace of the film is relentless. It is one of the very best vampire tales ever told on film. Genre lovers, if they haven't already purchased their own copy, should definitely check it out. Turn out the lights, hunker down, and prepare to be chilled by a classically spooky film."
2,Sort of liked it.,"The problem with this film was it had the wrong title. It should have been called: ""Attack of the Soul-Sucking Vampire Zombies from Haley's Comet."" This would give viewers a much better sense of the true spirit of the film."
5,Lifeforce,This film is not for everybody but it is a very scary vampire movie that is a drive in classic.
3,"Great movie, bad transfer.",Cannot wait to have this movie in a better DVD release than this one. The image was shrunk and the quality was not the desired one.
2,Vampires from Space attack Earth,"Yes, the concept is bad but the movie isn't as bad in the way you expect, nor is it much good.I bought it because I saw it in the movies so long ago and it made an impression on me then. The London scenes weren't outdone until 28 Days Later and it has a number of things going for it, not to say the least a very sexy female lead that walks around naked for a good part of the movie.The story is a bit overexplaiend and there are a number of scenes where learned men talk intulectually about the events occuring that are a massive suspence killer. This is in addition to the fact that it is rather silly and silly should not be rationalised.I found it a lot worse than I had remembered but I am still glad I had a second look. But I do not recommend it to first time viewers except maybe those how migth be heavily into Vampires and Sci-fi - then it might just be worth a late night viewing."
3,a film like no other!,"I like Hooper's movies (especially Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Poltergeist) - but this is definitively his weirdest movie to date! It is a mixture of Aliens, Night of the Living Dead and Outbreak - never again will you see such a combination! That doesn't mean the movie is perfect: Story? Acting? All medicore! But for Henry Mancini's fantastic score and the weirdness alone it's worth a look!"
4,A Howl! Erotic sci-fi vampire extravaganza is lots of fun!,"Tobe Hooper (Texas Chainsaw Massacre) brings together 1) hysteria over the return of Halley's Comet, 2) an often nude 'space vampirette', and 3) near armageddon as London is decimated by life-force stealing vampires. But the highlight for *me* was seeing Patrick Stewart in his last role before taking the helm of the USS Enterprise (Star Trek: TNG, First Contact, Insurrection). When I first saw this in 1985, I had no idea who he was, but when I saw this on DVD, I had to laugh out loud! Stewart is PERFECTLY cast as the major domo at the insane asylum."
3,"Strange, goofy, unintentionally funny and never boring",A truly crazy flick involving space vampires. 12-16 year old boys will probably love it.This sci-fi-horror-disaster film combo is packed with special effects and action scenes involving everything from comets and space travel to putrefying zombies and the destruction of London. It also has lots of nudity.Boring it is not.The DVD transfer is good with some slight shimmering (for the nit-picky)on some bright scenes. Good for a 1985 release.
3,Two of Keaton's Best!,"The thing that sets Buster Keaton's films above most other silent films is that the stories are always easy to follow, inventive and entertaining. Though the second half of the film Sherlock, Jr. - when Buster leaps through the screen and into the movie inside a movie - is more often celebrated, I found the first half to be the more humourous. The bits with the sticky paper and the dollar in the trash are laugh-out-loud funny, as is the scene where he is trailing his adversary.Our Hospitality is truly delightful film with a simple, yet entertaining, story and a number of very comical scenes. The best of these occur on the train ride at the beginning of the story and during Buster's attempted escape at the end. The former segment is constructed around a fascinating primitive locomotive and the ridiculous placement of the train tracks. The latter contains many great moments, but the climax of Buster swinging from a log and catching his love in mid-air is truly magnificient."
1,Unfunny and stupid,"I'm going to weigh in on these dreadfully unfunny films. These films are both stupid and terribly dated. I can't understand how even a contemporary audience, back in the 1920s, could enjoy this unfunny nonsense. I wanted to stay til the end, but I found myself fast forwarding because I just couldn't take it. There is absolutely nothing funny about Buster Keaton or either of these terrible waste of time flicks."
2,"Romeo and Juliet, the tragic story review","Romeo and Juliet is a tragic story written by the very famous English writer William Shakespeare.There are many books about this story and some movies were also made.The story is about one young man named Romeo and a young woman named Juliet. Unluckily they fall in love.Each one of them is from a different family, Juliet of the Capulets and Romeo of the Montagues.This two families had been feuding from a lot of years ago.Friar Lawrence married Romeo and juliet,who becouse o killing an enemy(juliet's cousin)in the streets of Verona was banished.Juliet escape from verona to mantua were romeo was but because of a miss understanding plan both end dead. Romeo and juliet is a sad story about two youngs that wanted to lived in a free love but the family didn't permmited.It is a difficult story specially the one written in a form of a play but it is good."
5,Review of Romeo and Juliet,"Romeo and Juliet is a tragic novel, but very enthusiastic and incredible. In my opinion best Shakespeare's play. It's theme is very attracted: a couple of lovers who want to be together no matter what their families say. Both families hate each other because of an ancient feud. Juliet was a Capulet and Romeo was a Montague. Romeo did many things for Juliet along the play.The couple was ready to die if they had to. Romeo was exiled because he murdered Tybalt, Juliet's cousin, so he had to go away. But the lovers weren't ready to separe. So to be together they decided to die rather to live without love so that is what they did. Like Juliet said: ""I'd rather be dead than live without thou love, Romeo"".So as a conclusion we could say that this novel is an example of true love."
3,KNOW WHAT YOU ARE ORDERING.,"When I first saw the item I thought it would be a great item. I also though it might use electricity hints the name of the trick. But the actual item you get is about 20-25 cards linked together with string and tape, you have to be gentle with the deck and make sure none of the strings holding the cards together break because it is not great quality. There are basically two strings connecting each card to another card. Like I said the string that holds the cards together it somewhat junky, not real durable, I got my ""ELECTRIC CARD DECK MAGIC TRICK"" about 2 hours ago and already one of the strings is messed up. it was not anything I was doing, the string just simply broke because of the cheep string and tap.So, basically the string and the tape that holds the cards together is some what junky and cheep. I think they miss lead you by the title of the trick; also, I think the price is a bit high.On the other hand the cards are fun to play with and they trick people easily."
3,Great Effect,"I bought this thinking it was a device... I was wrong, however it's a great effect, you cannot let spectators touch the cards and to do some of the effects you need to practice. works better as a stage/parlor trick. you can do the same effect with regular cards just practice a lot."
2,me,Nice looking pack but the buckle broke. Seller replaced it and the new one broke also. Seller gave me full refund for everything shipping included. Thanks
1,Never Dependable,"It is discouraging that a company so respected can market a product so disappointing. I have struggled to use my HP IPAQ hx2495b. At any given time it can be dead even after a charging. When one goes to the multitudinous questions available to narrow the search for answers, frustration increases because the answers are not sufficient. I have ceased to consider any HP products and will replace those I have in the next weeks."
2,Big disappointment,"I went to fund raiser for a Non profit organization that we like to support. Saw this at their silent auction, bought it. It was new in the box thought it would be good for helping me organize. Right from the start it would not drop the align screen page. Called HP, they suggested a clean reset, didn't work. Now I have to send it in for a $49.00 service fee, what a joke. Take my advice look elsewhere and don't buy an electronic item new in the box from a silent auction."
2,HP doesn't deliver,"Brand new this did not synchronize from the start. Sent it back to HP they said it would be $300 to repair it as the main board was flawed. I said ""but it's under a 1 year warrenty. Well be sure to read it, it's doesn't cover the main board. HP was horrible to deal with, never would return calls and kept it for over three months and did nothing. So once I got it back I went to bluetooth to synchronize and it worked great, but you can't move music, so what good is this? I love it's possiblities but it just has too many bugs!"
4,Good one,This is the first pda i have owned so I dont know how it compares to others. Works fine but the only thing wrong is that it hangs sometimes.Otherwise great!!!
1,alarms: what is that.,"the alarms don't pay any attention to the settings in sounds and notifications. they repeat twice and then quit. the light doesn't flash except the first time. half of the time they don't work. i sent it back for repair and they didn't do a thing to it but send it back to me the next day. same problem, it is the way it is designed but they won't admit it."
3,IPAQ hx2495,"Lots of features, lots of function, great display. BUT bulky and heavy compared to a Palm VX. Frequently requires a soft reset after charging. The charging cradle should have a socket for a spare stylus, since getting at the stylus while charging is inconvenient.It is hard to determine which accessories fit a particular model of IPAQ.The removable battery is a great feature, as are the slots for CF and SD cards.Unfortunately, for the core functions it is slower and less convenient that my old, long-in-the tooth, Palm VX."
4,"Great product but 1 known issue, u have to cal em to get at 100%","Okay so there's a memory stick/battery issue problem... when u put in a memory card to these devices eventually the battery goes dead after like a few days.... i called up hp and their aware of this, they have a bios patch that still wont fix the problem for everyone... to fix the problem i got them on the phone and theirs a set up via battery saving issue and after u mess with the settings it wont have any more issues.... They were very help full and called me back a week later to see how the issue turned out. I would give it 5 stars if it wasn't for this whole thing, but besides this battery issue it's a great product."
3,Office capabilities are limited.,You cannot open more than 1 word file at a time. That capability is crucial in my work.
1,does not live up to promise,"A cute book, but contains very little information for all of its promise. The authors are busy making jokes but not talking about the nitty gritty of restoration. Maybe it is to hard to do since every job presents its own challanges. I just found the content thin. I am sorry I purchased it. If I could have found a copy in my local library, I would have saved some money."
5,worked great for me,"I just want to say that the previous reviewer, I think, was distracted by the folksy style of the author, so much so that he didn't see the nitty gritty. I actually restored a trunk--my first--off Morse's step by step in this book. He offers great help such as tool lists (I purchased the hand tools he recommended) and tips on chipping old paper linings out of the trunk (an impossible task without his wisdom) and also clear instructions on how to shore up wood cracks--two kinds, cosmetic and structural. I was able to restore a Civil War era trunk with a broken back to a nice cosmetic state so that it looks nice in my house. And I made it structurally sound enough to use as my toddler's toy box."
2,Painful to Read,"I was hoping to glean some new information from this book. Although I already consider myself an ""inner circle"" assistant, there is always something new to learn. I can say that I didn't get very much substance from the book (unless you count all the notes that I should put in my laptop case or write in my notebook that I have embossed with my initials--both suggested by Ms. Burge). There were large parts of it that I finally just skimmed because it was so boring.If you are an administrative professional who is in they early stages of your career, this may be a good book for you. If you've been in an upper-level administrative role for a period of time, I'd recommend skipping this book. The good thing for the author is that I bought her second book when I bought the first. Otherwise, I'm fairly certain I wouldn't have made another puchase. I hope my second review will be better."
2,More motivational than substantive,"Although the book covers quite a bit in its 250-some pages, it lacks serious substance. While it motivates those in the administrative field to take charge and harbor an invincible positive attitude, it offers little direction or guidance beyond that. Noted in the Acknowledgements that the book was a 35-year work in progress, it shows. Many sections seem brief or entirely cut off with no direction or conclusion and the book flits through sections with no clear path. There's a lot of build up and no real answers to the questions that plague those in this profession. The entire book left me wanting to know more, but not giving me a whole lot I didn't already know."
2,I think it's under my couch somewhere....,"I dont know if this book has valuable information or not. It is as boring and dry as a communion wafer so I didn't make it past page 50. I'm a 100% non-fiction girl, so when I say it's boring, you can trust me, its boring!"
2,Become An Inner Circle Assistant - Excellence,"The book presents a unique opportunity for readers to experience many of the same things that are offered in the Star Series ""Excellence in Performance"", if they don't have the opportunity to participate in the series.The book is an alternative source of information that is available to interested participants/individuals who want to experience and support being a part of the inner circle philosophy. Taking and changing the stereotype of the secretary from someone that just answered the telephone(s) and ""kept secrets"", into basically a working functioning partner for the individuals they are assisting.The book described several categories from learning how to communicate better and making decisions, to having enough savvy and intelligence information to allow your leader to spend time on other critical projects that require their time."
5,"Balanced, Informative, insightful",The negative reviewers of this book fail to judge the book on its merits.
1,Religious Absolutism,"The whole theory behind this book is flawed. I think what Berman is talking about is one small part of a whole phenomenon that has manifested itself increasingly in the last few years, namely the phenomenon of religious Absolutism(i.e. Religious Fundamentalism). It exists increasingly in all major religions, i.e. Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Jewish religions. Actually the so called war against terrorism is basically a war between manifestations of that absolutism in the U.S., The Arab/Muslim world, and Israel. The major problem, that we are facing is that Islamic religious absolutism, is a great recruitment for christian, jewish, and Hindu religious absolutism, and vice versa. Good and evil, Black and White, us and them, believers and non believers, chosen and non chosen people, are the common language used to express religious absolutism. If liberals and religious pragmatists cannot change this vocabulary, than we are in for some crazy times in this world."
1,Left's confusion,"Probably the reason Paul Berman doesn't write about good ""Third Force"" alternatives is because there aren't any. It's just a dirty deal that probably won't get done."
1,Mr. Berman-A Neo-Con in sheep's clothing.,"I am not going to spend the time and effort to discredit this obvious neo-con view of the Middle East, but merely to identify it as such. Do some research about the author and you will see that he is certainly no progressive, disillusioned or otherwise, on Middle East matters. If you want to read more than you already have about the neo-con view of things on this subject, you may want to pick up this book; otherwise, it is a poor choice."
1,Another rubish from so called Western Journalist,"This book is nothing but rubbish directed against intellectuals and thinkers to counter the so-called Islamic threat. Mr. Berman tries to convince his readers that the Islam teaches terrorism and hate, but he does not want to be in the same pot as Salman Rushtie, so he hides behind Syyed Qutb (may God be pleased with him). Syyed Qutb gave his life to tell the TRUTH and spread to all the humanity. It is too bad that Mr. Berman has chosen to turn his back from God and justice. This book is nothing but stupid propaganda from so called expert."
2,Yawn,"A fairly typical who dunnit. I found it almost boring. I would have like more. But, there is already too much of this genre."
5,East of A,"This book was outstanding. The story content was interesting and intriguing and held my interest, especially at the end. I would recommend it for good reading."
3,East of A...,I kept reading thinking it would get better. It didn't. It was too down in the gutter for my taste.
2,RCBS 130,"I have not used it yet. I tried to balance the scale to zero, but I can't seem to keep it zeroed. The unit is mainly plastic and very light weight. At this point, I'm not impressed."
3,A Good Weekend Read,"***POSSIBLE SOIPLERS***First, in short response to 'Lakelands' review: The characters have not yet gained trust in the other characters or the audience yet, so how can they tell their life history in the first three days that we know them?Second: I think the characters are too hard on themselves, and like Lakeland, expect too much too sooon out of the other.Third: I think the book is well written. However, I think the author has a style of writing that takes some getting used to.Why throw the book away? Give it to a second hand store; just because you don't like it doesn't somebaody else won't."
1,don't waste your money!,"This book was absolutely rotten! The cover was awesome and so I was misled into buying it! There was absolutely no backgound onchartacters so it is impossible to get ""caught up"" in the story.Not romantic, not riveting. Blah! I didn't care about the vague plot, I just wanted to get it over with! I would never recommend this to anyone! I read 20 to 30 books monthly and not all are ""keepers"", but this was such a disapointment!! Don't judge a book by it's cover!!!!!"
1,Where Is The Love,"In short, I couldn't bring myself to finish this book due to Rowena's abusive behavior. Great cover and very misleading."
1,Dont waste your time or money,This book was mediocre. If you bought this book return it to the store and retrieve your money back.
4,enjoyed it,an insightful and quick read. the stuff about parcells is especially good. great for any NFL fan.
2,Expected a lot more from Phil Simms,"My wife is a footbal junkie. We were the first people in our known universe to spring for DirecTv and the NFL package. My son could sing the Eagles fight song before he could ask for a bottle (I'm not kidding). So when a Superbowl champion QB tells me he's going deep on strategy, I think I'm going to learn something. Well here it is: Just because you can play, and just beacuse you can comment on things that happen in front of you, doesn't mean you can write a book. I had a hard time finishing it, and that is saying something."
4,What a way to start the school year!,"Sunny is mean, despite her cheery name, and she'll do whatever it takes to get expelled from Plumstead Middle School. Eddie is a wimp, and he'll do whatever it takes to not be killed by seventh and eigth graders. Salem is a writer, and she's always taking notes about life so she can have a good story. Pickles invents stuff, and is well-liked around town. These four kids have only one thing in common--they're going to report to the principal's office!This book was pretty good. I really like Jerry Spinelli's books, and this book was no exception. There were a lot of funny parts. But there were also a lot of boring parts. I would still recommend this book to someone, though. Another thing I like about this book is it tells the truth about sixth grade life. There are so many other books about sixth grade that are so unrealistic."
4,Good book to prepare for middle school,Report to the Principal's office is another Spinelli work of art. It is a good read for any up and coming middle school student. It is a book that shows how a group of 6th graders deal with a new school and a new set of circumstances. Four unlikely candidates become good friends as they deal with their individual struggles of middle school. There are 3 more books in the serries that extend the story throughout the school year.
4,Dylan's Review,"Report to the Principal's Office by Jerry Spinelli is a detailed, well-thought out book. The main characters are Sunny Wyler, Salem Brownmiller, Pickles Johnson, Eddie Mott, and Charles T. Brimlow. The story takes place at Plumstead Middle School. The book gives you very detailed character traits and visual traits of characters in your mind. Every character has their own unusual personality. You don't need pictures to see what's going on in this book because of the detailed descriptions of the settings and the characters' actions on every page of the book. It also describes the characters' thoughts, and there are plenty of characters you meet in this story. I would give this book a 5-star rating and recommend it to anyone looking for a detailed book to read."
1,Sunny iwants to be expelled so she can be with her friend.,"A heartless story of a girl named Sunny, that is truly disgusting and absurd."
5,Willy outdoes himself here,"This is one of my favorite live recordings of all time. It's spontaneous and the sheer pleasure that went in the making is present in every song. All the goodies are here, including Spanish Stroll, Demasiado Corazon, Hey Joe, Lilly's Daddy's Cadillac, Bamboo Road and a very special, emotional rendition of Heaven Stood Still, with just Willy's voice and a violin. If there's only one album by Willy DeVille you should like to have, it should be this one. But if you like this... you want to have the rest!"
4,"One to read, one to buy","There have been a lot of books written recently on the topic of same-sex marriage and yet Professor Jordan still manages to say something that wasn't covered in any of the other books. He explores marriage and its associated (or claimed) theology and the intersection of marriage and the reality of gay male romantic lives. He actually says a lot more of what marriage is not and what same-sex marriage will not be and makes very few assertions about what marriage or marriage theology are or how same-sex marriage will look like. Which is an assertion in itself. Anyway, any book which cites Queer as Folk rates high in my book."
5,Great Read!,I also picked this book up on a whim!!Glad I did!Great Read really hard to put down!I enjoyed the way it was written very entertaining!
3,decent read,"I got this book hoping it would be a romp through the carnival world at/around the turn of the century. There is some great stuff in the book about Mabel and her tiger training, but I was hoping for more from the rest of the carnival. 3/5 of the book is quality, but the rest is a little long in the tooth. I had fun reading the book but I was glad when it was over."
5,EXCELLENT!,This book was excellent. It's the sort of book you think about all the time until you can pick it up again.BUY IT!
4,"Good book, solid explanations","The book livews up to it's name, these were all projects you can use on the job. I have used multiple projects in my own work. It is helpful to go to the site and download the project files to follow along. There is one section in the first book that gives ou instructions on making the E that are wrong...this drove me crazy for two days until I figured it out. But otherwise, you'll recieve use out of most of this book."
2,Not happy,i love the way this book gives you products to desgin that you will be doing at work. The projects templates that you can download are not available!!!
3,love element took away from Gere's performance!,"Gere is great at portraying the extremes of bi-polar disorder, but the film is lacking in two major areas. One is the boring doctor/patient relationship and the other is the fact that bi-polar patients also exhibit weeks, months, and even years of ""normal"" behavior. I wish the film dealt more with the difficulties of having relationships with family, friends, and lovers. Bi-polar disorder is a serious one and medication is a must in order to balance yourself. The movie should have shown some of the struggles of finding the right medication for it."
3,no title,"By the director of ""Stormy Monday"", which I thought a much better film. I didn't think this was that good; but Richard Gere's performance is a marvel. He has really grown here. Unfortunately, Lena Olin was once again too weepy, as she was in Robert Redford's ""Havana""."
5,Great Abnormal Pschy 101 movie!,Great for people wanting to see Bipolar in people that can look mostly normal-most of the time-depending on support and drug therapy.
4,One of Gere's best,"I just rented this movie and thoroughly enjoyed Gere's spot-on portrayal of a man with bipolar disorder. As other reviewers have duly noted, the love story wasn't really necessary, as the movie's honesty and insight into manic-depression is worth the price of admission. However, it did bring to light how unlovable Bipolar people almost always feel - unworthy, not worth loving - and the isolation that causes them. All the actors were excellent and I don't think I've ever seen Mr. Gere more fetching. :-)"
2,BELOW AVERAGE,"Totally empty history, a plot that doesn't take off anytime, Olin is bad, Gere is stereotyphed, and the old history of doctor and patient falling in love is boring."
2,"Tedious, unimaginative...an overall bad movie","There isn't really any aspect of this dud that I liked and it should be no surprise that it was a dismal flop with audiences and critics. It's neither original, exciting, or realistic. Gere tries his best to give a potentially complex character some dimension but comes out surprisingly superficial and by-the-numbers. I felt it had something going for it after Gere starts conducting a Beethoven concert (the only good scene in the whole thing), but once he got rushed off to the mental hospital and meets his doctor, I knew the film was totally lost. Once again Gere does try, but it's all very harmless stuff."
5,wonderful performances,tearjerker and wonderfully put together drama - Richard Gere is great in this and gives a very convincing performance.
4,THE 39 STEPS..,"OKAY NOW,THIS IS A HITCHCOCK FILM..WHEN I BOUGHT THE CRITERION EDITION OF THE 39 STEPS, I WAS REALLY EXPECTING A MOVIE LIKE NORTH BY NORTHWEST..39 STEPS IS FOR SURE AN EARLY HITCH CLASSIC AND I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU THE LASERLIGHT ONE BECAUSE OF IT'S FAIR PRICE (I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT EDITION BUT I HAVE LASERLIGHT'S THE LADY VANISHES AND THE AUDIO + VIDEO ARE OKAY), BUT IF YOU ARE A REAL FAN OF THIS MOVIE OR THE DIRECTOR OR IF YOU ARE EAGER TO HAVE THE SUPPLEMENTS, GET THIS DISC..(BY THE WAY THE AUDIO IS PERFECT IN THE CRITERION ONE)."
3,The 39 Steps,"I had seen a play with the same name. Because of the rapid action, I found it difficult to make sense of it. I ordered the original movie, hoping to learn what was significant about The 39 Steps. Because of the rapid action, British accents etc, I was not able to learn about The 39 steps."
2,Not A Great Movie At All!,"Choose ""The Birds"" over this any day. This movie was not a five-star movie! The ending was too abrupt, and the secret was hard to hear because he was talking too fast. Classic, indeed!"
3,GOOD?,"WHILE VIEWING THIS, I HAD BECOME LOST IN A SENSE. WHAT DOES ONE EXPECT FROM HITCHCOCK? SUSPENSE THAT INTRIGUES YOU GREATLY AT TIMES. BUT THIS FILM LACKS THESE ATTRIBUTES. THERE WERE GOOD SCENES THAT HELPED THE FILM GREATLY, BUT THE LACK OF SUSPENSFUL SOUND IS WHAT CREATES THE SMALL QUALITY OF AN ENDLESS BORE. MUSIC IS WHAT CREATES SUSPENSE. TAKE ""PSYCHO"" FOR EXAMPLE. NOW JUST PICTURE THE SHOWER SCENE, WITHOUT THE CLASSIC OVERTURE THAT IS WELL KNOWN TO SCARE PEOPLE: ALONG WITH THE SCREAMS ETC. THIS FILM LACKS MUSIC. MUSIC IS THE MOST POWERFUL MOOD CREATOR EVER. I DO REALIZE THAT THIS IS ONE OF HITCHCOCKS EARLIER FILMS AND THE SOUND IS SOMEWHAT HORRIBLE. THIS IS MOST AGREEABLY, HIS BEST BRITISH FILM. I WOULD SUGGEST SEEING IT AND YOU WILL SEE FOR YOURSELF THE OUTCOME. THE ENDING IS NOT WELL PLANNED. IT HAPPENS TOO QUICKLY WITHOUT MUCH BACKUP. FURTHUREMORE, IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE ONE OF HITCHCOCK'S BEST BLACK AND WHITE SOUND FILMS, I WOULD HIGHLY RECCOMEND ""THE LADY VANISHES"""
1,Over Rated,"This has everything I hate about old movies: ham acting, corny dialog, and implausible plotting. The characters in this are about as bland and uninteresting as you could possibly create. I have not read the book on which it is based, so I don't know who is responsible for the weak plot. This is nothing but a chase movie. A murder happens in the beginning, then the main character spends the rest of the movie running from bad guys and having narrow, implausible escapes. There is no gradual accumulation of information in the movie as you would normally expect in a thriller or mystery. The mystery just gets spontaneously solved in the closing minute. If Hitch was a genius, he sure doesn't display it here."
4,Early Hitchcock is memorable,"Although I do not think most people are aware of this movie, it has a very clever and well-constructed plot and I would recommend it. After getting used to the British accents (it takes a while for some reason), it is a very enjoyable movie with suspense, intrigue, action and romance. I would especially recommend it to Hitchcock fans and old movie buffs."
3,whadda ya want for 4 bucks?,"It is about the same quality as a late night viewing on TV of the film; the disc is not at all DVD-level clear. But you can't quibble about the price: it is sub-VHS. And since tapes degrade and DVD does not, I'll live with the muddier picture on this one."
1,cheap=poor quality,"Diamond Entertainment's DVD of 39 Steps is VHS (taped off a broadcast-TV late-late show in SLP mode) picture quality. Very soft. This is not what DVD is meant for. I can only comment on the Criterion Collection version for comparison. Criterion picture quality=9 out of 10, Diamond picture quality=3 out of 10 (10 being best). Save your money."
5,It's All in the Lighting,"This film is one of my favorites, to my mind ranking just below ""Vertigo"" (which I consider Hitchcock's masterpiece) and above ""North By Northwest"", which although spellbinding at times doesn't sustain the unbroken suspense of this 1935 work. The faces of both the major and minor characters, from the cleaning woman who discovers a body in Richard Hannay's flat to the wary farmer and his pitying wife to the innocent, handcuffed blonde, are all perfect. But what makes this film soar is the impeccable use of light and shadows - on the moors, in the farmhouse, in the bedroom of the inn. ""Vertigo"" is Hitchcock's best psychological study; the original ""39 Steps"" his best action-suspense yarn. This early work by the Master is coming upon its 75th Anniversary and it holds up remarkably well - in plotline, in dialogue, in acting, but most of all in texture. It's can't-miss filmmaking at its finest."
4,Criterion is eccellent.laserlight version is average.,"I don't know who praised the laserlight version of this film(perhaps a shareholder?)but my advice is-don't be fooled,get the Criterion version.The Laserlight version is a cheaply made copy with poor sound and a reasonable but much less clear picture.Criterion has made a quality print of a fine classic film and that is the one to get."
3,Early Hitchcock,"An interesting look at Hitchcocks's early work, you can defiantly see some of the tropes that would become common in his later career. There are some great uses of sound (most uniquely the transition of the train whistle) and POV. 39 Steps also has an interesting (if not entirely realistic) story that generates the suspense Alfred is known for.Where the film drops the ball is the characters and the acting. At no point was I the least concerned with the fate of Hanney. This could be because the character never stays consistent. At one moment he is the everyman put in a wild position trying to be just ahead of his pursuers to stay alive, the next he's a super genius who gayly bounces witty banter back and forth with Pamela. It's enjoyable, but it also lessens the suspense. What isn't enjoyable is Pamela, who as a character is both annoying and entirely forgettable.39 steps isn't a terrible film by any stretch, but it also isn't a great one."
2,save yourself the torture.,i however didnt and ended up being completely bored for nearly 1 and 3/4 hours.Dont watch this version watch the robert powell version its totally cool.
1,BE CAREFUL - ONLY BUY CRITERION EDITION,"If you don't get the Criterion Edition, you will be getting an inferior transfer of this film: fuzzy images, fuzzier sound...yuck! The ""bad"" transfers include the one that Tony Curtis introduces.Again, look for the Criterion Edition."
5,The best copy I've ever seen!,"I first saw 39 Steps a few years back on AMC with my son, who was 7 at the time. We missed the ending, and ever since we've both been wanting a chance to see the rest. Since then I've bought two copies on VHS that were so bad they were unwatchable. Finally, thanks to Criterion, we were able to watch it all the way through. This print is nearly pristine, which makes watching this great movie that much more enjoyable. Like each of the Criterion discs I've bought so far, this is a must-have for your collection."
3,Better Than Hitchcock,"I found the ending to this film to be disappointing, I might even say lame or contrived, and that ruined my enjoyment of most of the movie. I strongly recommend the 1978 remake with William Powell, John Mills, and David Warner. This is one of those rare times when a remake was better than the original, and that's even rarer when the original was a Hitchcock film. The climax in this one is action-filled, and will appeal to any fan of mystery/suspense/action classics. I give the '78 remake 5 stars. I've been unable to find the 1978 version here in the US, maybe because it was a British production, but I just visited Amazon in the UK, and it is available there. Just remember , if you're buying a foreign DVD, verify that it will play in Region 1 (US & Canada)."
3,Good Value,"This is a must buy for anyone who is an avid Alfred Hitchcock fan and doesn't want to spend the extra money for the Criteron editon. The picture and sound aren't perfect, but it's definitely watchable. This is a worthy addition to any classic or Hitchcock collection."
1,Great Movie- Horrible Quality in this version,"I have seen the movie many times and was very disappointed in the quality of this version. While the original move is wonderful this version is not one to purchase. Amazon would do well to remove this from their inventory as the picture quality is poor, the dialogue is out of synch and the sound is uneven."
3,The 39 Steps,"Having read the book and seen the film several times, I prefer the book. The dead person in Hannay's flat is a man and there is no beautiful blonde woman involved in the book, but knowing that Hitchcock had a love for blonde women, it is understandable, that there had to be one in it. Also the 39 steps in the book refer to a house at the coast, where the steps go down to the beach to a boat. Still the film is full of suspense and well worth watching.Rosemarie MacDonald"
1,"Don't buy DVD version - it is not Criterion, only BluRay","I am a recent fan of this film and (having watched the crappy transfer they have on Amazon Instant Video) I was delighted to see a Criterion edition - particularly for the special features included.Sadly, this page is incredibly misleading.I did not purchase the BluRay because I thought I was saving a few dollars. Fool me once, shame on you.Amazon should change the listing to make it very clear that the DVD is the same crappy (shaky, bad sound) transfer they have available for streaming. The intro / outro by Tony Curtis makes it even more painful.The ""trailer"" on the DVD is not even for the 39 Steps - it is for North by Northwest, which adds insult to injury.I am asking for a refund."
1,39 steps badly mastered,"This is the only bad review I've ever done on an item. This DVD is crummy. The sound track does not match up with the images. And the sound track is only barely intelligible. Finally, the mastering on the DVD format left loads of residual squares throughout the movie."
5,One of Hitchcock's Greatest British Films!,"The Criterion DVD of The 39 Steps is very well done. The print is excellent and the extras are wonderful. I especially love the radio versions of the stories they often include on Lux Radio Theater. These versions which Criterion has included on many of their DVDs could have easily been lost but are a wonder to hear. The 39 Steps is a terrific movie and probably the greatest of the British period for Hitchcock. Hitchcock made may terrific films during this period but I love this one the most. There is a great ""Battle of the Sexes"" relationship between the characters played by Robert Donat and Madeleine Carroll with a wonderful plot of a man misidentified as a murderer while he tries to uncover a ring of spies. This is a Hitchcock film that is a must to watch."
4,39 steps,"This is a great old classic movie, a section of which I had seen on the Classical Arts network. The DVD is in good condition, and these old movies still can keep one on the edge of one's seat. Imagine a thriller with virtually no violence or blood-letting! (there is a little, but it sure isn't the main focus of the film)."
2,enlightning,"This is a serious book on psychology,not one of those ""how to"" popular books.To me it was very helpful, it helpsto understand oneself better.I reccomend it warmly."
2,Deep,"This is a very hard read, very deep and one must truly truly be alone on an island to read this book"
3,"think before, during and after reading","The book is a glorification of the irrational, if that is a worthy aim for people in the present world. I suppose there are many individuals who, in mass society, feel so insignificant that any fantasy activity is appealing to them, but whether it really will help them along the path of self-improvement and to find meaning in life, I seriously doubt. The so-called Spanish of the author hardly qualifies as Spanish for its many flaws and shortcomings, and I suppose that her assumed Hispanic aspect is as shallow in meaning as her vulpine activities. Men, however, may find reading this tome of value in determining which females to avoid (like the plague)."
1,Endless psychobabble,You too can write a book. Take half a dozen folk tales and surround each one with endless (and I do mean endless) psychobabble.Save your time and money. Skip this book.
3,"Disappointing, compared to Theatre of the Imagination","LOVE the book, Women Who Run with the Wolves, and have listened to some of the tapes of that book on Clarissa Pinkola Estes' tapes, ""Theatre of the Imagination"". I was hoping to get the CD or tape version of Theatre of the Imagination, Vol. I,but it doesn't appear to be available through Amazon, so thought I'd try this.This was published 3 years before the book, Women Who Run with the Wolves, and it is certainly less polished than ""Theatre of the Imagination"". She just seemed to wander a bit.I wouldn't recommend it to people who love the book, but my friend loved it!"
5,What every developing female needs,"Dr. Pinkola Estes' take on the importance of folklore in the development of the female physche is something that I believe every young female needs. She explains how our modern day society has lost some of its connection with the world around us and how old folklore was originally designed to help give life lessons. Unfortunately, the days of sitting around the hearth and exchanging stories is long past. Its sad to think of how much we have lost with the advances we have made...There is alot of scientific jargon, but it is a very interesting and enlightening read."
1,Waste of time,Started this book for my bookclub....found it very disconnected and boring. My friend suggested I skip ahead a bit and see how I felt then. Still bored! Don't think it is even worth the one cent I paid for it. I don't need some wacky book to tell me who I am!
4,Good,"The book is in good condition and came in a timely manner, I just cant read it because the print is so very small. Other then that its fine if you can handle the tiny print"
3,Focuses on the pain feminine wounds instead of the healing,"I've just recently started reading more about ""feminism"". The word itself carries such a negative connotation that I actually prefer to refer to it as the sacred feminine. This was a good listen, as far as seeing into the archetypes and mythology. However, it was really heavy with the past wounds of the feminine, and I kinda felt more pulled into the pain of all of it then liberated into strength and freedom. I recommendThe Dance of the Dissident Daughter: A Woman's Journey from Christian Tradition to the Sacred Feminine (Plus)by Sue Monk Kidd andIx Chel Wisdom: 7 Teachings from the Mayan Sacred Feminineby Shonagh. They are real women's journeys through the discovery of the sacred feminine and they are very inspiring!"
2,Women Who Run With The Wolves,I did not realize that the copy of this book was a very small book. I expected the regular size paperback which I own of my own copy. The print in the book I received is also very small. I bought it for a friend and good thing she is young. She has good eyes. I was disappointed.
5,Wonderful myths,"I'm an EQ coach and also help people develop their right-brain functioning, and I use these stories over and over, and recommend this book to my clients. Myths tell us of the collective unconscious and lead us into symbolic thinking, and this book has so much to offer. I've read it more than once! It's one of those books that the more you bring to it, the more you get out of it."
4,"Share the Stories, Plant a Seed","As a male psychologist I applaud this book. The stories are wonderful, the message is very important. If we do not continue to share the stories, all will be lost. From generation to generation, please share the stories.The growth that many of my patients have received from this book is vast. I have gone back to it many times. Recently I shared my own story of my sexual abuse as a child, "" Above His Shoulders. "" I thought many times about Women who run with the Wolves as I wrote. I knew the importance of disclosing my story. Not just for my family, but for others who have and have not disclosed their own trauma."
3,Not Unabridged!,"Although a good CD, this is NOT and UNABRIDGED version of the book. It does have some content that the book does not. However, if you, like me, are looking for an unabridged version of the amazing book, this isn't it."
2,Buyer Beware on audio edition,"I am not commenting on the book, which I would give five stars. I bought a CD audio version only to find out it wasn't an unabriged version. It was the author telling stories from the book. I should have realized that the total time was way too short for the entire book, 2 hours 20 minutes. THIS IS NOT AN UNABRIGED EDITION OF THE BOOK!!! I want an unabriged version of the book."
2,NOT unabridged,"I am reading Ms. Estes' book by the same name and am really enjoying it...so much so that I got a copy for my daughter before I even finished the book myself. My other daughter preferred a CD of the book and when I found this ""unabridged"" version, I bought it for her. I was very surprised when she finished it in a little over 2 hours and many of the most compelling stories had been omitted. If everything in the book is not on the audio version, it has definitely been abridged. Amazon needs to change their description so the buyer knows what they are buying."
2,Too academic and dry for me,"I had hoped for an easier read- I am college educated, and can read this sort of thing, but I thought that it would be an easier read than this. I find it too academic for my tastes- the first pages didn't pull me in. So I'll recycle it at The Book Exchange. It had been strongly recommended by a friend, but if I had paid attention to the reviews on-line I wouldn't have bought it, because it did look heavier than what I wanted. And it was."
5,Ref'sThoughts on Bossa Nova,This is an album for all occasions. A true classic!The female vocalists on Carta Ao Tom 74 are like a chorus of angels. Joao Gilberto's voice is soothing on Falsa Baiana and of course Sergio Mendes' Garota de Ipanema is the quintessential Bossa Nova tune.This album is timeless. You'll enjoy it for another 30 years
4,Good source for quirky statistics,"I would recommend this book to people who frequently make speeches, toasts, write lifestyle articles for periodicals or are simply curious as to what intimate behaviors have been measured and rated.The book's collection of statistics range from the off the wall (6% of marriage proposals are delivered over the phone) to the obvious ( 95% of people have suffered heartache) and to the shocking (82% of women would rather receive a mushy love letter than diamond earrings). These fun and insightful facts are perfect little gems that will spice up any lecture or, at the very least, make for great cocktail chatter."
3,Overpriced for the size,"I, admittedly, did not read the dimensions before buying this - so I warn you, this is very small. It is the size of a piece of printer paper. I love the artwork, but I just wish it was bigger or cheaper."
5,Fun and durable,"My one-year-old grandson adores this little bear on his tricycle and is learning how to pull it back and let go so it will shoot across the room. He hasn't mastered it yet but loves it when we make it go for him and keeps trying, so I gave it five stars for ""educational value"". It's well-designed, bright and durable. One of his (my) favorite toys!!!"
2,Toy Broke on Day 2,"This toy is adorable and was a lot of fun-until the mechanism which makes it roll across the floor broke the day after we opened it. When you push down on teddy's head and let go, the toy is supposed to ride by itself for a bit, kind of like those cars you pull back and let go. The second day we had it the mechanism which makes him ""drive by himself"" broke, so he just pops right back up and doesn't go anywhere. This was really disappointing. :/"
5,LOVE IT!,"I am amazed at how quickly my cd was delivered! I found it at a great price, and had it in hand within a few short days. The copy I ordered for my mother, in another state, also arrived promptly and in great condition."
1,Get the book!,"As a poet, I was enraptured with the book. Written in the 40's, I can still pick it up and say ""Wow!""But to listen to this guy reading an excerpt... makes my soul shrivel. Get the book; forget the recording."
2,Prysock vs. Harvey,"I ended up here because I was trying to see if Laurence Harvey's version of This Is My Beloved is available on CD. Alas, it does not appear to be. I am one of the lucky ones who ran across another vinyl of it a few years ago many years after losing my first copy and am listening to it as I write. As much as I love Arthur Prysock's voice, no one can TOUCH Harvey's version of this book and I have both! I would suggest checking stores that specialize is used/out of print albums for Harvey's version. No disrespect to Prysock, but you'll never listen to it the same way again!"
1,Poorly done,"I can only compare this to the Laurence Harvey LP that I lost 20 some-odd years ago, and it is a poor imitation. It becomes apparent immediately that Mr. Prysock is an amateur when it comes to dramatic reading. This poem requires a skilled professional, such as Mr. Harvey, to provide the tonal nuances and subtle changes of cadance that bring these words to life. Also, the music is inappropriate and in many places overpowers the speaker. Use your money to buy the book."
4,There she goes again,"I heard the La's version of this song on ""The Parent Trap"" and loved it. Then I heard SNTR's cover,which is much better than the original. I loved it even more. Leigh Nash's vocal is pretty(not strained and shrill like the La's)and exudes the relaxed vibe of someone thinking about her lover on a warm summer day. There's only one problem: Why is a woman singing ""There SHE Goes""? Shouldn't it be ""There He Goes""?"
4,This in not the Velvet Underground song,"It's unbelievable that any audiophile who would be so presumptuous as to correct the readers as to the origin of this song, would do so incorrectly.""There She Goes Again,"" the Velvet Underground song covered by R.E.M. and others, is NOT the same song as the La's ""There She Goes"". Both have a 60's quality, but they are not the same song.The La's indeed did first record this brilliant song."
5,There She Goes (NOT Velvet Underground),Things appear in print and they become fact...One reviewer stated that There She Goes was originally a Velvet Underground song. Wrong. Different song - not even close. I bought Velvet Underground & Nico years ago - on vinyl - and am familar with that album. The only thing they have in common is a similar title and both are fun songs.
1,Don't buy this!!!!,The people that reviewed this single are totally wrong. The original version (by the La's) is a hundred times better.
1,Bland Cover of A Great Song,"When the La's released ""There She Goes,"" the released a timeless, underrated classic. Sixpence None The Richer try to duplicate the greatness of the original, but fail. Their cover sounds bland and uninteresting although they try to make it a little different by switching the key a little. However, it just doesn't work. Get the original by the La's instead. Nice try."
1,Nobody Understands....,"The majority of reviewers on this board contend that this rubbish cover of The La's immortal single ""There She Goes"" (absolutely the best record of the past 15 years) is superior to the original, which is akin to saying that Oasis are a better pure pop band than The Beatles. Firstly, Sixpence None The Richer (a Christian band) don't seem to understand that Lee Mavers' classic, chiming tune is actually about heroin addiction! Secondly, the reviewers here who keep mumbling about this song's debt to The Velvet Underground don't understand that Mavers was far more talented than Lou Reed could ever hope to be (I abhor ""...& Nico,"" easily the most overrated album of all-time). Simply, the fact that the Liverpudlian genius's signature tune has been turned into a MTV tween hit is an atrocity."
1,Don't buy this single,"This is the worst cover of one of the best pop songs of 1990's, buy the original version by the La's."
1,The worst cover i've heard.,"The La's produced an absolute classic in 'There She Goes' but this is absolutely atrocious record. Whilst the original was played with a proper feeling and drive this is sung out of tune, poorly performed and really sounds awful. 'Kiss Me' is an awful record too. My advice, Buy the La's version but avoid this totally!!"
1,dont buy this,"""There She Goes"",and""Kiss Me"" are terrible songs.They should be played in a restaurant bathroom,not on the radio.DONT BUY THIS S**T!"
3,This is OK but there are better Stevens Collections,"This collection lacks 22 poems which appeared in ""The Palm at the End of the Mind"", Holly Stevens carefully edited selection highly approved of by Harold Bloom. Missing are ""Of Mere Being"", ""A Child Asleep in Its Own Life"" and ""For an Old Woman in a Wig"" to name but three. It leaves out the added lines of ""The Man Whose Pharynx Was Bad"". It lacks an index of first lines. If you're going to buy a book of Stevens' poems spend the extra $10 and get the magnificent Library of America ""Collected Poetry and Prose"" which contains EVERYTHING, is a huge bargain and will keep you occupied for the rest of your life. Or possibly get Holly Stevens ""The Palm at the End of the Mind"" which eliminates a lot of lesser poems which could confuse a newcomer to Stevens. The Vintage people have thrown this together without much thought. It's better than nothing, but the other two books I have named are the one's to get."
5,Poet of the Incomprehensibility of God,"I've had this collection for years, and it is fine. What I particularly like about it is that the selection emphasizes the religious dimension of Stevens' work. It is filled with beautiful heresies, about the about the unfathomable wonder we all live in. Just the sort of thing that annoys the truly unhappy."
5,"Iffucan, read this book and then have some ice-cream!","Wallace Stevens is a god! If you don't know him than there is definately something wrong with you. Have your head examined. Then, buy this book. It is an excellent compilation of Stevens's great work. If you don't like him than you are a caveman with a shallow brainpan, and I just don't like you. What a wonderful poet. He really really is just a wonderful poet."
3,Determined through period.,"This continues to disinterest, more out of differences in poetic palatability than in actual quality. As a supposed surrealist and modernist, harboring such structural rigidity ultimately defeats and contradicts Steven's full adoption of his moniker. Quite honestly, the majority of his work, while revolutionizing a style throughout his time, fail to stand to many other, more literately dense poets. Brenda Shaugnessy is a strong recommendation for a polished example of the craft.Pet sounds to Kid A. The difference is immediately obvious."
3,"A Reading of ""Domination Of Black""","Length:: 2:06 MinsWallace Stevens is really two poets, or rather, he is a poet slowly turning into a turgid metaphysician as one reads through this collection. The best of his poetry is in the earliest book here, Harmonium, with some other fine ones in the second book, Ideas of Order. - I notice that almost all the five star reviews cite and quote poems exclusively from these two early books as opposed to the four following ones and the section of poems entitled ""The Rock"" at the end.The poem I read here is - naturally - from the earliest book, Harmonium. It is haunting, Imagistic and disquieting. It is Stevens at his best."
5,"This is an old book, but pretty good","I like this particular book because it has both sides in one volume. It's been around for quite a while, but I still think it ranks up there with the best of the books on the lives of the individual soldier. Enjoyable to read in general."
3,tight fit,"I have no complaints about the shipping, it was very fast.I also received exactly what I ordered. The fit of the holster is very thight. So thight in fact, that when i tried to get the gun out the holster it wouldn't come out, I just pulled the holster out from between my belt. I'm hoping that this will get better in time."
2,Boring,"I don't understand why anyone would want to read this book. I picked it up because I am interested in Umbria and hoped for a good story which took place in that area of Italy. The book was boring and unbelievable; I kept waiting for something to happen, but it never did. I would not recommend this book."
4,Excellent intro to VxDs,This is the best book I have seen on the subject of VxDs. I was able to get my VxD up and running in less than a week. Great reference and useful source code.
4,Fun way to start the day,"This is a really great book for dreamers of all ages. As an apiring writer I have to force myself to write something every day - but this is so much better!! It inclues dream facts, and tips on how to remember them. The layout is also creative and inspiring...great book!"
1,Not a good buy,"This wasn't what I expected at all,The pen would not write so, I had to throw the book away, because you can only write in it with the pen they send you, awful experience with this."
2,Not worth the hassle,"We bought this toy for my four year old son. It was fun for a bit, but the door, side wheel and front part of the van all keep snapping off. My son is unable to put them back on himself and it is tiresome to have to keep putting them on every minute or two. Also, the pizzas shoot out so fast that it is difficult to find them. Plus, the pizzas are pretty small and I wouldn't recommend this toy if there is a younger sibling that likes to put things into their mouths."
4,Turtle Power!,"My 3 year old loves this turtle van. All four turtles fit in just fine and with a little extra shoving you can even fit in April. The big problem is the front and side door falling off all the time. It doesn't bother my son at all though (since I'm the one fixing it 50 times a day), and he'll even play with it when I get tired of putting the doors back on. Its also very durable, withstands many falls and even being sat on. You can't beat it for the price."
3,Bought this for a 3 year old,I bought this for my 3 year old son for his birthday. He plays with it everyday all day long. I do agree with the fact that the doors fall off to quickly but I just gave up on keeping them on he still has lots of fun with it. I would recommend this for anyone that has a little boy that wants a vehicle for their action figures.
3,Its an ok action figure,"Ever since the Marvel Legends lineup was signed over to Hasbro, things have gone downhill for the once prestigious action figures. This Thor figure comes with his trademark M'jornill hammer and the executioner's battle axe. He is from the storyline ""Thor Lord Of Earth"" I pressume and it looks ok compare to the other Thos figures but not the best one yet! However I don't recommend anyone to go and buy from these sellers/scalpers on here that want $29.99 for it thats exageratted considering that it just came out and its selling for $9.95 and Walmart or Target. Say no to SCALPERS who buy everything of the shelves and jack the price up online to make a living out of it!"
4,If you are studying 1 Peter this book is a must!,As I read the new testament books of the bible and study carefully what it says and how to apply it to my life I usually turn to Warren Wiersbe for a great commentary and devotional. 1 Peter can be a bit overwhelming with all the references to submission and to suffering and rejoicing. Weirsbe's comments added clarity and devotional insight to a topic that is hard to grasp without time and repetition on the truth therein. If you are going to be using 1 Peter in group study I would highly recommend this BE HOPEFUL as a valuable resource for all. God Bless You as you study and apply! 4 stars not 5 because i would have liked MORE of it!!!
4,Excellent!,I really appreciate how this was applicable to most people and very easy read. I learned a lot from reading this book.
5,GOOD SELLER,The Book arrived within the allotted time with no problems. The item was at least in a codition that was equal or greater then mentioned within the listing. No problems with the purchase.
4,Indepth study of 1 Peter offers great insight,"Be Hopeful by Warren W. Wiersbe is part of his renowned and wonderful Be series digging deeply into each book of the Bible. Be Hopeful focuses on the book of 1 Peter. The book offers historical and spiritual insight while going through the book verse by verse and really breaking it down for readers. Each chapter ends with study questions for further reflection. Peter's message in this book was one of hope, despite the coming persecution he foresaw for followers of Christ, and every word of it is still relevant for believers today. It's an excellent study, and I hope to read more of the series."
4,A good way to study 1 Peter,"""Be Hopeful"" by Warren Wiersbe is one of the most unique books I've read. It is labeled a commentary of 1 Peter, but it is unlike any commentary I've ever seen - maybe I need to read more of these. Rather, it reads like a Bible study. It's loaded with thought-provoking study questions for personal reflection of group discussion, so it would be a great way to study 1 Peter alone or with a group.And the best part is that this book is part of a series of ""Be"" commentaries. I will definitely be on the lookout for these books."
5,"Extremely tasty, good value","This is my new favorite protein supplement. Easy on the stomach, tasty, all natural, and has some carbs which I prefer to straight protein. It is also certified gluten free."
2,Beware!,"I have been eating this Iron-Tek protein for over a year now and loved it, however recently they have changed the formula to a ""new and improved taste""...it's horrible. It is not as sweet, and it tastes ""protein-y"" which is why I used to like about this brand because it didn't. If you are a long-time lover of this brand, the ""new and improved taste"" is not what you used to eat."
5,At the heart of your long distance relationship,My husband and I are reading this book together. We read a couple of chapters every night and discuss them over the phone the next day. The points in this book are well stated and are helping us a lot. This book is making a huge change for the better in our marriage and I think the biggest impact is that we are doing the work pages in the book and discussing them and telling each other what our answers and ideas are. We love this book!
4,Standard Breakfast,"I have been eating Erin's for Breakfast for over 2 yrs now. Very filling, taste is excellent. Good to take along when you're late for work as I usually am. A great all around breakfast. I like mine warmed up in the Microwave."
3,Disappointed,"I loved the Morning Glory Breakfast Cookie! The Fruit & Nut was dry and just did not taste good,and I usually love anything with nuts."
2,"Taste like a fiber cookie, not too impressed","These cookies taste like those health fiber cookies and not really that good, they dont contain alot of nuts or flavor, I purchased this flavor and the banana nut flavor.. honestly they both taste identical. I canceiled my subscription for them. but my wife says ""when she needs fiber she will eat 1""...I just replied ""LOL go for it""."
3,not gourmet,more flavor than peanut butter-pieces of fruits and nuts-expensive-ok but certainly not gourmet-not bad forbreakfast or lunch-pretty filling-did not try other flavors
3,"Dry, Stale, High Calorie","I found these to be dry & stale. Also, relatively high in calories/points for me (I'm a lifetime weight watcher) and I'm not sure the trade-off for convenience and nutrition is worth. Frankly, I think I'm better off with microwaving a bowl of oatmeal for breakfast for taste/filling/cost.Won't be buying these again."
4,Definitely Interesting,"There are a lot interesting facts concerning all different languages, words and phrases; while it is very interesting it really bothers me that none of it is cited. This book is authored by Charles Berlitz, so maybe, since he is an authority on language he doesn't need to cite his work, but it would have been nice. Either way it's an engaging read, however, I wouldn't go around quoting it without backing up some of the statements with a source to confirm them."
5,GG Allyn,"This book was fun and interesting. I particularly enjoyed the attention ""Native Tongues"" paid to some Asian, African, and Native American languages. If you looking for a non-complicated book about human languages, then this is the right book for you."
5,Simplesmente Fantástico,"Este é, sem dúvida, um dos melhores livros que eu já li, sendo ao mesmo tempo leve e profundo, sério e divertido, popular e acadmico. Recomendo para todos aqueles que gostem de ler um bom livro, daqueles que no conseguimos largar até chegar a última página. Indispensável a qualque biblioteca."
2,Very uneven and dated sounding,"Too much wa wa pedal and overuse of electric piano /mini moog.The acoustic stuff however shines as much now as it did thenThose are 5 out of 5.The electric stuff,meh!"
3,Didn't get into it...,"Love the band but never really got into this disc, reminded me of 80's sound but in a really bad way. Sorry RTF!!"
1,not worth it,PA state inhertince tax book tells you everything in this book for free and it is available for download from the state. I wish I had not bought the book.
4,Almost perfect Batman book,"From the start I was enthralled. The art, the story, the atmosphere all had me captivated. I really enjoyed the drama tone Living Hell had. It didn't start out with a sense of action/adventure but more of a serious prison drama. It definitely had action especially towards the end but for the most part it was a drama about one guy who got stuck in Arkham Asylum.Other reviewers were also disappointed with the way the book turned out in the last chapter and I have to agree with them. It wasn't what I was expecting and all the while I was reading it I was kind of discouraged. But once I got to the last few pages I was like, ""This totally rocks!"". In my opinion it made up for all the ""weirdness"" that was in the last chapter.Overall It wasn't as psychological as Arkham Asylum: Serious House on Serious Earth but it gave a good feel for what life is like at Arkham Asylum."
2,My Review,"The movie wasn't what I expected. Nicholas Cage's performance was less than spectacular and the performance given by James Coburn wasn't up to his usual standard. Michael Biehn's performance, in my personal opinion, was the only one that was up to par. Personally I think Michael Biehn is a highly underappreciated actor who deserves to be recognized for his work as well as his work ethics."
1,Coppola's nephew flatlines already dead career with horrid crime caper,"You'd think a cast of pro actors (Michael Biehn, Nicholas Cage, Sarah Trigger, Peter Fonda, James Coburn, Mickey Dolenz, Clarence Williams III, Charlie Sheen, Rene Estevez and PHANTASM heavy Angus Scrimm), and a famous family of cinema to guide him, Christopher Coppola (nephew of Francis and director of the better-forgotten 1989 opus DRACULA'S WIDOW) would have no trouble pulling off a neat little GRIFTERS-style caper flick. Instead, he pulls only inconsistent performances out of many in the cast (Cage is cosmically unrestrained) and proves himself a questionably talented heir. Just dreadful, and little more than a self-satisfied catalog of eccentricities, mannerisms and ""offbeat"" casting."
4,Man! What was Nicholas Cage thinking?,"This movie is not a comedy, but with Nicholas Cage giving the most hilarious performance of his life, it turns out to be quite an aisle-rolling experience. I mean, he goes from one accent to another, he's snorting coke, chewing chiklets, and best of all he takes his aggression out on innocent clotheshangers. It's a classic, believe me. I only wish more people would have seen this, like say members of the Academy before they handed him that award. It's funny, but only worth watching for Cage. James Coburn and Michael Biehn add to the hilarity somewhat, playing strongly off of Cage's ""Hotheaded"" Eddie."
3,Deadfall,Nicholas Cage was very annoying so I guess he played his role well. Hard to follow at times. Definitely not one of my favorites.
2,"Watch Nic Cage's parts on youtube (spoiler alert, but it doesn't really matter)","Mr. Cage is the only redeemable part of this film (thus the second star), and, spoiler alert, he dies while there's still half an hour left. That half hour is the most torturous half hour of film I've seen in a long long time, and I've seen White Chicks. Do yourself a favor and search for Deadfall on Youtube. You can see all of Nic Cage's stellar moments in one quick two minute video."
3,A-List actors in a B-movie nearly pull it off,"Before Nicholas Cage became more famous then he already was, he decided to play a supporting role in this film about a con man's son who must now reinvest his life's work with his uncle after an unfortunate accident with his father.Biehn stars as the son who's role in the ill-fated con forces him to seek work elsewhere. He finds shelter with his similar scheming uncle, yet must fend off his uncle's main henchman, played eccentrically by a strikingly un-muscular Cage.The film builds up to a con similar to the one that failed with Biehn, but along the way, we are blessed with a con artist's potpourri of side adventures more befitting of an ""Alice in Wonderland"" tale.Sadly, the payoff, while surprising, isn't very satisfying. Still, there are many reasons to watch this B-movie. Just don't expect a sequel...or a good ending."
2,Going USB...,"I have this unit and it worked fine until I bought a new faster PC. I reinstalled it on the new machine and I had lots of problems with sharing the parallel port with my HP OfficeJet. I tried to update the driver from DATAFAB's web site but that was a complete nightmare including a failed install that left the uninstall disabled.Another annoyance was on booting the PC, I would get an extraneous page printed on the printer. Also, the status light on the unit that before would turn green when the flash card was inserted, now always stays red.I have decided to buy a USB flash card reader."
1,Does not read standard flash cards!,"For the money, it looked too good to be true. It was.This reader seems to read some odd-sized flash card, but you can't determine that fact from its user manual or installation guide. The documentation is completely silent on how to use the device, or what type of flash card it's supposed to read.What is certain is that no matter which way you try to insert a standard digital camera flash card (as in my Fuji MX-600), it either won't fit in the slot, or the card makes no apparent connection with this reader. And because the manual doesn't tell you how to insert flash cards, it dawns on you slowly that nothing works. xyzzy = nothing happens.So if you have standard flash cards, don't buy this device. If you can determine what kind of flash card it endeavors to read, and you have them, then this device might be a great deal."
2,Not that Great,I really wouldn't recommend these to my friends. I was really looking for something that actually tasted like a chocolate chococolate chip cookie. Just didn't like them.....Sorry
2,should have gone with another flavor,DId not like the chocolate oatmeal raisin. wasnt very tasty. It is filling and wholesome but I would not buy again at this price.
2,Check your pull dates!,"Amazon needs to start checking expiration dates on food products. On my last order of Erin Baker's cookies, both kinds of cookies I ordered were past the pull dates. And being the kind of person that doesn't check these kind of things, I didn't notice until my wife pointed it out after I had ate half of them.I'll be looking from now on, though!"
2,dont care for this flavor,Has neither a strong chocolate nor raisin flavor. A little bland for me and doesn't fill me up yet is a lot of carbs for one serving.
5,A fantastic breakfast,"These are one of the few breakfast bars that actually fill me up and get me ready for the day until lunch. The flavors are outstanding, and the consistency is that of a home made cookie. All in all, a great start to the day."
1,"Great movie, very blurred picture","I bought this DVD to watch ""The General"" and ""Steamboat Bill, Jr."", but the picture is very bad, dark, blurry. They should look for better prints to do the DVD transfer, or just don't release it. I've just bought the Blu-Ray versions below, hoping they'll show sharpness and detail, along with three different options of soundtracks.http://www.amazon.com/General-Blu-ray-Buster-Keaton/dp/B002NTDX6O/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1328565109&sr;=8-1http://www.amazon.com/Steamboat-Bill-Blu-ray-Buster-Keaton/dp/B003H221MS/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1328565145&sr;=1-1"
1,Not worth watching--nothing Keaton put out really is and maybe never was,Like so many of Keaton's films it is more fun to wish you could watch them than it is to actually tune in.This film has one novelty only--the ship looks expensive. Beyond thet its as worthless as Keaton's cheap short films (of which there are two on this DVD). The films all usually have very little intelligence in scripts (though Battling Butler was almost a smart Keaton movie). The sets look like they cost about 50 bucks to make (on the shorts and almost every last one of his long films ---this movie only looks grand mostly because of the passenger ship--the sub at the end looks like a $10 prop set). Why did anybody think so many would want to warm up to this loser of an actor called Buster?
3,This 2-video set contains 6 of Buster Keaton's two-reelers.,A great sample of one of the greatest comic genius's of all-time. This is a 2 video set containing: The Electric House; The Boat; The Paleface; The Frozen North; The Playhouse; Cops. It was delightful. I showed some of these to my 13 year old son and made a new Buster Keaton fan.
4,Good Pen,I have this same pen in the orange/red finish. It's actually my favorite pen. Very consistent output with various inks. I also like that the cap screws on. I recommend this pen.
3,How to find a personality by slot car racing,"Anthony Hopkins is the efficency expert. In this movie he is to decide if an old shoe factory is to be closed and the staff fired. When he first arrives, he's ready to close the factory, but as the movie progresses he finds that the workers are more useful that he first thought. As the movie progressed he moved from a man who was just as empathetic as the character he portrayed in ""Nixon"" to someone who actually relates to other human beings...the funny part is that a slot car race at the local club is the act that finally fosters a change in him. The movie drags in spots but I think it was done intentionally to give a laid back contrast to the hard charging but souless expert.Mike"
3,"Not bad, but not as good as the first.","I am sad to say that this album was a tad flat in comparison with the first Before You Were Punk. This hurts to say because I am a fan of many bands that appear on this album. The problem is that they don't convince me that these songs were done due a personal mission to revive them. It feels more like they were offered a few dollars to record a song and then go back to the bar. Yes folks, I am saying that this album lacks passion. If you like the eighties and new punk I would advise one to pick up the first release. You will have more memories haunting you and your mind will ache from singing them over and over in your head."
5,"Has the best covers of any songs out there, rad cd","This is by far one of the best cd's I have. Every single song on it rules, especially Every Breath You Take and Regret. Some of these bands have so much talent, taking old songs and adding a little bit of 90's punk to them. A must buy for anyone who likes good punk and 80's rock. I guarantee that you will like it."
4,pretty neat,well this is a cool cd. who woulda thought that 90's punk bands would do such awesome cover songs from the 80's. its damn good...its just that a few songs soung almost exactly like the origanals....kinda strange.....
3,it's ok,"The only thing that really shines on this album is Strung Outs cover of every breath you take. Anyone who says this song blows is a complete moron. For the rest of the songs, ehh...., a lot of bands could have picked better songs to cover. Overall buy it used or discounted."
2,Not Working,"Janet's second single from her album ALL FOR YOU is the summer time jam ""Someone To Call My Lover"". Unfortunately, it is a step in the wrong direction for Ms. Jackson. STCML fails in many areas, mainly its inane lyrics over a poorly produced sample of America's ""Ventura Highway"". Can't people write good songs anymore, without ruining classics by sampling them? This has to be one of the most pointless songs ever, with the most childish lyrics I have ever heard from Ms. Jackson. Then there's the So So Def remix, as if the world needed another remix from Jermaine Dupri. Overall one of the more weaker songs from her equally disapointing 2001 album ALL FOR YOU."
2,Rick Anderson,"I must say when I heard the entire album, I was over all dissapointed. Unlike Ms. Jackson's previous recordings, this albuum is full of explict jibberish that...says nothing. The hold project seems rushed. Janet, dumped the explict stuff...it makes you appear as if you have nothing left to give and runing of out new material. I know sex sells but you have true beauty inside and out, which is much more marketable and pleasing...i'm waiting. However,""Someone to call my lover"" is cute.Rick Anderson"
3,Received wrong model,The package description does not specify if the kit is for a 6 or 10 gallon tank. The kit I received was for a 10 gallon tank which will not work with the 6 gallon atwood tank I have and I had to return it.
3,Over priced,"This product is severely overpriced!! I just found the same product, sized at 400MG for $3.00 less than the advertised price on Amazon. Needless to say this will be last time I purchase from this company."
4,One of Tomita's best,"The second half drags a bit, and there's his impossibly cheezy homage to Close Encounters to deal with, but no other electronic music of this period sounded quite as overwhelming and lush. His high-tech take on Prokofiev is moving, and the album as a whole is cleverly sequenced to tell a somewhat goofy but occasionally quite eerie story of alien visitors. I'm amazed nobody ever produced a film - or at least an animated work - based on this disc.I wish RCA would get around to releasing this on SACD or DVD-A. It was originally recorded for playback on 5(!) speakers - pyramid sound, with one speaker overhead - and would sound incredible as a multichannel disc today."
5,ONE OF THE BEST SPACE ALBUMS EVER,"If you are a fan of Tomita this may be his best work. For those of you that have never heard of him I feel sorry for you. He was a one man orchestra. He remade older and newer classical pieces with keyboards and synthesizers.Sadly this CD is very pricey do to the fact that IT is a very hard to find import. For some reason they never released it and half of his other albums in the USA, on CD. I wish I knew why. Lost classics. Get them all anyway you can find them.He paints soundscapes unlike anything you have ever heard. IT is a journey into other worlds. Turn of the lights and let it take you."
3,Great music -- less than ideal packaging,"Great music -- worth four stars. Not my favorite Tomita, but still very good. Why 3 stars, then? No fault of the producers, but I wish there were a US release of this album, like so many other Tomita. Most of the liner notes here are in Japanese (of course), and what little English text there is is in micro-font. A great listen -- but I'll buy it again someday if/when it is released in America."
3,Is it a Movie Script or a Novel?,"Alexandra Styron's ""All the Finest Girls"" is a slight novel with touches of some genuinely fine writing most of which comes at the end when the story has unfolded and the main character Addy is evaluating her life and that of her parents and her beloved nanny, Lou. At times in this novel Ms. Styron suffers from what I call ""TonyMorrisonization"" which translates as: make the prose so dense and so convoluted that it must be read at least twice to understand it. Oh yes, and flash forward and back as many times as possible(hence the allusion to a movie script in the title of my review). ... All and All a good first novel. Ms. Styron is talented and I look forward to her second effort."
2,Won't ever be re-reading this one,"This book gets a C at best. It's a typical story of a woman trying to learn about herself. She's from a broken home, raised by a Carribbean nanny... Nanny dies, girl (now a woman) goes to the funeral and gets a cold welcome from the Nanny's family. There are the expected class and racial issues, and the outcome is dull... Just a common story."
4,texas blues from austrilia,"born in austin,texas and now leaving in austrilia for the last few years. won the male artist of the year in 1998 by the austrilia music awards. steve plays texas plays with amazing grace and a great voice also. this cd highlights his great playing and songwriting,if you like svr to anson fundenburgh you will love this cd also his first cd west texas refugee is amazing"
5,Wonderfully Seductive,This is one of the most romantic albums I own. You throw the CD in and voila!! Let Joe take you to the beaches of Brazil with songs such as Viva Sonhando and Triste. Joe Henderson captures the essence of Jobim's beautiful but simple melodies. This album is for lovers!!!
2,Jobim,"All the songs on this CD sound so much alike. That is, the saxophone dominates the group. This work comes across as disjointed, not as a cohesive ensemble."
3,Middle Ages,The word mediaval means the middle ages. The period from 500 to the end of the 1500s. The Crusades began in 1095 to drive out Muslims. The king gave land to barons who supplied soldiers. At the bottom were peasants. Most women had to work. Vlad Tepes was the most infamous baron. The Crusades lasted 3 centuries. The church was the center of the mediaval world. The average life expectancy wss 30 years. The Black Death saw 1/3 of Europe's population dead by 1348.
1,Huh?,"Glad I ""borrowed"" this from Amazon. If I had even spent $1.99 on it I would have been ticked off. Don't think I am an idiot who never reads and has never read this type of book. Well, okay, go ahead and think that if you want, it matters not to me. This is simply pompous trash."
4,Delirious 1991 John Candy,"At First when I started watching it, I felt bored,but I actually started to like it. John Candy makes the movie even better. I hate soap operas, So I love the way the movie makes fun of it and even though I am not a romance comedy person, I liked it. This was before The Truman Show. Good movie."
4,"""Good Comedy!""","John Candy, Mariel Hemingway and more star in this 1991 comedy.A writer dreams he's in his soap opera making things happen.I've always liked this film and glad to have it on dvd thathas good picture and sound, but only a trailer. I miss Johnand recommend this good comedy."
2,The Truman Show meets Groundhog Day,"Candy stars as a soap opera writer who finds himself inside the show and able to change things as he likes.Another movie which wasted Candy's talent, has been overshadowed by other films with similar ideas doing them better, such as Groundhog Day with Bill Murray and The Truman Show with Jim Carrey.Nevertheless, Candy's charm carries you through, and the movie is watchable just for that."
4,Kirby Stone Four Have Fun,"This double CD from the lesser known boy group (Four Lads, Four Freshmen) is good fun to listen to with superb vocalizing on all sorts of music, from the classic ""You're My Thrill"" to the Kirby Stone-penned ""Lassus Trombone."" These are for the most part upbeat selections and only one selection clocks in a more than 3 minutes, that being the Harry Warren and Arthur Freed hit ""Coffee Time.""The Kirby Stone Four had a much different sound compared to the other guy groups and there is a nice variety of female voices on these tunes as well."
1,Printer was never right after using this ink,"I purchased this ink to use in the Brother DCP 110C. I rarely print so this printer did not get much use in the first place. Who knows if it's a coincidence but when I used this ""compatible"" ink, the printer never worked the same.In all fairness, the printer was never that great to begin with but I truly believe this ink was the final curtain. I don't want to dog this product but buyer beware."
2,HOW GIRLS ARE CONDITIONED TO BECOME MOTHERS,"Nancy ChodorowThe Reproduction of Mothering:Psychoanalysis and the Sociology of Gender(Berkeley, CA: U of California Press, 1978) 263 pagesA highly technical studyof how girls are conditioned to become mothers.Why women want children--from a Freudian perspective.Other books challenging the motherhood assumptioncan be found by searching the Internet for:""Books Exploring the Decision to Have Children""."
2,Provocative Ideas -- But No Data,"No data. Zilch. Nada. No in-depth interviews, no participant observation, no historical analysis, no surveys, -- just one woman's musings.She of course may be right in the end, but without ANY research to backup her claims -- it is just a rant.This book definitely made me think about raising kids and what I wanted in a spouse, and definitely makes a strong case for equal parenting. But in my opinion, good scholarship is a marriage between data and theory; a synthesis of research and imagination. Without both, a scholarly book falls flat. Chodorow did no research, has no data, and thus this book ends up being speculation at best, flat-out myth-making at worst."
5,Book Twelve Days of Christmas,I was very happy with the product and the quick shipping that I received. I would order again from this person
3,"Nice pictures, but...","I bought this book because 'The Twelve Days of Christmas' is one of my son's favorite songs. I love the illustrations, they're beautifully done. However, the order of the lines appears to be an older form (and somewhat less standard now). The way I've always heard it sung was 12 drummers drumming, 11 pipers piping, 10 lords a-leaping, 9 ladies dancing... this book has the lords and ladies first, then the drummers and the pipers. I realize that this sounds like a funny gripe, but little kids can get really focused on something being in the 'right' order and since this version is going to differ from the way kids hear it sung, it has the potential to bug them."
5,Wonderful illustrations!,I enjoyed reading this book and Jan Brett's illustrations were beautiful! I liked learning how to say Merry Christmas in many different languages. This is one of Brett's most colorful and actively illustrated works.
5,Timeless and beautiful!,Beautifully illustrated children's books are becoming rare. Jan Brett is an accomplished illustrator and the book is a classic. The combination of a classic with illustrations that enchant the eye every time is a work to be treasured.
3,Cute book!,"While I didnt exactly love this book, it was a cute look into a Jewish girl's experiences growing up. I admire Susan for putting this on paper for us to read."
2,Snooze,I tried so hard to LIKE this book but I just couldn't. It was boring and slow and took me a month to finish it bc I hate not finishing a book I started. I feel like her life was not that fascinating to be publishing a book about it. Ugh.
4,Memory lane,An enjoyable read with many reflections of a familiar past for a woman of my age. I laughed out loud at times and found the direction of the book pleasantly unpredictable.
2,I guess humor is subjective,"From the smug opening preface, which encouraged me to laugh and enjoy her tales, I should have know what to expect. A pretentious voice, stories bordering on the trivial, and not a laugh to be had. I enjoy humor, womens lit., and personal essays, but I would only recommend this book to people who found ""the Nanny Diaries"" insightful. Read ""A Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing"", or any of David Sedaris' work instead."
1,"A better title might be, ""Me, the Unique Rebel""","Really, everyone who has given this ""author"" one star has hit the nail on the head; she wants to be fascinating. I suppose there's nothing wrong with that................until you decide that you're such an ironic paradox and so profound that you should probably publish. There are so many wonderful books and amazing authors out there; don't waste your time."
4,"Funny, but it's no Kiss my Tiara","Humorous account of her memoirs, I always enjoy a mouthful of saucy sarcasm. However, I remain loyal to her first book of ironic, irreverant commentary on strange female behaviors. Rent Hypocrite from the library, but buy this one.Kiss My Tiara: How to Rule the World as a SmartMouth Goddess"
5,Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress,THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ!! I loved this book and everyone I have recommended it to has shared my opinion. Read this book and you will agree with me. It's funny - so funny that I laughed out loud! That doesn't happen very often while reading a book. Do yourself a favor and take a break from the serious side of the street - this is one you will enjoy!
4,Like eating potato chips,"Once one starts reading HYPOCRITE IN A POUFFY WHITE DRESS, it becomes difficult to stop--just like eating potato chips.Author Susan Jane Gilman describes her childhood which, by the standards of modern life, actually was not very difficult or extraordinary.No, the drama comes from Gilman herself, a woman who may define the concept of ""drama queen.""Her view of the world is hilarious, and her reporting is enhanced by her marvelous turn of phrase.For someone who has lived a rather unexceptional life (other than an evening spent with Mick Jagger) and someone who also is relatively young to be writing a memoir, Gilman has authored an entertaining and riveting book."
3,Quirky Memoir with a Notaro Flare,"With a style reminiscent of a Laurie Notaro book, Susan Jane Gilman recounts being raised by eccentric, hippy parents, being a kindergarten diva, and living with her husband abroad.Very entertaining and funny, this book is definitely for fans of Laurie Notaro and Davis Sedaris."
3,"""Laugh Out Loud""?","There are a couple of writers (Burroughs, Sedaris) who have made me laugh out loud, but it wasn't Gilman, and this is how many of her critics describe her writing. Her memoir overall felt like someone who just wanted you to sit down and listen to her because she likes the sound of her voice. The best chapter was the one on meeting Mick Jagger. I liked how she humanized her celebrity crush. But on the whole I just felt talked down to on some vague level; there was a measure of superiority in her tone."
2,Cute memoir...,"I've read quite a few memoirs, and this one was satisfactory. It follows the author from her hippy childhood on the Upper West Side in the `70s to early adulthood. I found several of the stories rather funny, especially the childhood ones, but some were also serious, showing how a family can be shattered by divorce. Nothing particularly spectacular here."
2,Mediocre,"There are some funny turns of phrase and a few humourous stories in here. But the smug, politically correct tone of the author quickly begins to wear and becomes nauseating before the reader even reaches the half-way point. Don't bother."
3,Third Times a Charm,"It took me three attempts to get past the first twenty pages. Once I was into the heart of the first section it was laugh-out-loud funny. Well, that was until the second part of the book which was a bit dull and mind numbing. However, the optimism from the first section carried me through to the final section of the book. It was definately worth making it through the middle of the book.This was an enjoyable read; the type of book to take to the beach for the day. There is about 100 unneccessary pages however, the remaining pages are witty, entertaining and enjoyable."
3,A personality book,"This book was a really great read if you end up liking the woman who wrote it. She lays bare all her naiveties and embarrassing moments in writing that skips along quickly, gracefully and wittily.Unlike some reviewers who found her knowledge gaps disingenuous, I found that I believed her more, and it suggested to me that she has written a lot of it from diary entries which adds to it enormously."
5,Pee-your-pants funny,"I loved this book! It was given to me by a friend as comic relief because I was reading too many serious books (I never read memoirs). I laughed so hard and so much that my cheeks hurt. I put it up there with David Sedaris in terms of wittiness and turning the mundane quirks of life into slapstick. Susan is brutally honest, bright, and the wastes no time laughing at herself. I can respect that.Very well-written. A must read. If you don't think this book is funny, you must be dead inside. :)Namaste"
3,"It is just OK, nothing special.","I found the chapters scattered and storyline pretty uneventful. The book was not a quick read. Pretty forgetable overall. Funny moments, some chapters were more entertaining than others, but def was not a page turner."
5,Even Better than Kiss My Tiara,"Hilariously told and raucous in its humor, Gilman spares herself least of all in this wonderful memoir. From the childhood stories of having to learn transcendental meditation in the 70s to meeting Mick Jagger in the 80s to the final pouf of the 90s, this is the funniest book I've read this year. If you're down about the November election, this won't cure, but it will help kill the pain."
3,Looks great; fit & support not so much,"I got a great deal on these shoes and bought them for fun. They look very cool -- even my ever-so-stylish teenagers were impressed. There is virtually no arch support and as I have wider feet and high arches, these were not a great choice for me. I gave them away after wearing them a few times. They probably run just a little more narrow than average, but otherwise fit pretty true to size. Very lightweight."
1,Wrong Product Ordered,"I wanted a moth trap thta would work against fabric eating moths, not food eating moths.I did not know that there were two different kinds at the time of ordering.I was disappointed when receiving my order to find that they were not the same kind I had previously purchased at another site."
1,Good product bad deal,"this is being sold for 5-8 dollars on most of the internet. word to the wise, buy this somewhere else."
1,"DOES NOT WORK, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY",This products is terrible and ineffective. We placed several around our home and only caught 1-2 moths in each. Get the pantry moth trap in the red and yellow pack. It is wonderful. Moths multiply so quickly that you need a powerful attracting mechanism to get rid of them.
2,Not very effective,"Compared with another brand this was not very effective. It did not attract more than 5 moths in a moth, while another one was very effective."
3,pantry moths,"The traps did catch about 12 bugs to a trap, I am still seeing a bug every day or so, and I still see an egg every few days."
1,no luck with this item,"I bought and installed two of these traps 8 days ago. Let me report on the results so far. The traps have caught exactly ZERO food moths yet I killed 62 in that time myself. I am willing to believe that the product I got was ""expired"" or ""defective"" in manufacture... but it is disappointing to say the least."
1,This product doesn't work!!,Followed instructions exactly! The pantry moths were flying around me and never went near the trap. One moth was on the wall and I put the triangle trap over it and the moth did NOTHING! Just waited until I moved box. Was not attracted to trap at all. I am returning it.
1,Don't waste your time or money,Took 3 weeks before they caught their first moth....and by no means has it eliminated the moths. Won't be trying this product again.
2,more moths,I think the pheromone encouraged breeding ...I swear there are now more moths than before !!
1,Very Small Adhesive Area,I had a bad infestation of pantry moths and tried this brand but was very disappointed to find that the area where the moths stick is very small even though the cardboard trap is as large as the other competitors traps. The sticky area fills up with moths and wing scale very quickly and then is totally useless even though it is supposed to last for three months. Poor Design.... I guess they want you to buy a lot of these. Check out the other brands. The best I found are the Pro-Pest Pheronet Brand. It is here on Amazon:Pantry Moth Traps - Set of Three
4,Be patient.,"These work. Within seconds of having torn open the little pheromone packet I was swarmed by male moths. You just need patience. The life cycle of the pantry moth takes time. There may be eggs that haven't hatched yet, and larvae that haven't metamorphosed yet still hanging about. You have to leave the trap out (and according to the directions) for a good long while to catch all the moths. The traps say they are good for 3 months...well you should leave them out that long to make sure you get them all. I believe we have conquered our pantry moth problem using the Safer brand traps."
1,Attracted nothing did not work at all.,"I was hopeful because I was sick of killing moth after moth. I have never before had this problem but was gone from the house for 2 months and came back to a bit of an infestation. I have gotten rid of all food and completely washed down the whole thing walls shelfs everything. I still get 2-6 a day on the walls that I kill, not one ever went in trap. I am not impressed. I don't know if I should try a different kind or look for a different method. Based on my experience I would not recommend."
1,It just doesn't work!,"I've tried this product several times. It just doesn't work for me, as for so many others. I'm an avid baker, and hate moths. These 'traps' can be up for weeks, and not catch a single moth - while I see moths in my kitchen! I put in another brand, and the trap fills in a week. Sorry Safer - maybe you need more product development?"
2,Not nearly as effective as the Catchmaster brand,"I usually use the Catchmaster brand traps, but saw these in the store and thought I'd give them a try. While they have the same design as the Catchmaster (basically a cardboard triangle with a sticky interior and a scent lure to attract the male moths) they don't work nearly as well. In the same cabinet, the Catchmaster trapped over a dozen moths; the Safer only got one.I'll be sticking (sorry for the horrid pun) with the Catchmaster from now on."
1,Does not work,Ths item does not work. I even sent an email to vendor to explain proper install of lure (in case I was installing it wrong. Never heard from them again. I would definitely not recommend this vendor or product
2,not as effective as some I've used,The area that traps the moths is quite small and I don't believe it attracts the moths as well as others I have used.
4,Works well. I've used this product for over ten years.,"Be sure to go through your grains on a regular basis to check for problems - flours, cereals, rice meals. Be diligent with pantry moths."
3,Not so hot,"The bait did not attract anything. When I spread a little smear of canned cat or dog food in the trap, I caught many, many gnats. Also worked great with bits of rotting vegetables. The sticky pads are very sticky, which is good and they last a long time. The product works, just not as advertised."
4,"These work, BUT, you must remove the source first.","My flatmate just loves to keep old cookies, crackers, cakes and snacks on the countertop....for weeks on end. We were absoutely under attack from these horrid pests. They were swarming EVERYWHERE! Even inside the toaster (((>_<))) I was furious. Got the traps and they caught some moths. A few weeks later, the attack was back. You must find the source of the problem. Throw away all old food and then wipe the countertops and shelves with tile cleaner w/ BLEACH. You need to set up SEVERAL of these traps, not just one or two. They are not cheap either! The traps will attract the males, thus ending the breeding cycle. (Gross!) At night time, come into the kitchen and be prepared to rat-tail these little pests with a dishrag. They are nocturnal and very nasty. They enter the home usually thru flour or flour-based foods. Good luck! These moths are VILE to the max. They are tough to get rid of.....trust me and my house is CLEAN!!!!"
1,Safer Pantry Pest Trap,"I was unimpressed by this product. When I put this product out on my counter, the moths looked a little dazed and confused. Most flew near the trap, but less than 10 percent got inside the trap, near the sticky part. The rest just kept flying around the kitchen. I also tried placing the trap inside the cabinet (with everything removed) with similar results. I would find moths within inches of the trap, but none inside."
4,Good trap - works well,"I like this trap - I have bought it several times now because it really seems to attract and catch a lot of moths.As long as you make sure to go through old food and throw out anything the moths have gotten into, you can successfully get rid of them with these traps."
2,Pantry pest traps.,"Safer: Pantry Pest Trap (2 per box) I have used this product many times over at least ten years. The most recent order was through Amazon, and the traps have proved to be mildly effective in attracting the moths. This is possibily due to the age of the traps. The little pheremone insert might be waning in its effectiveness over time. So, I think it is important that the traps be fresh, not from long stored supplies.I was dissatisfied with these traps, as very few moths have been trapped, compared to MANY in the past. Compared to past traps, these rate about a 2 on a scale of 1-5. Not good."
5,Do what it says,It definitely works. Be sure to read the package carefully and follow up with frequent cleaning of the effected area.
4,It Works....Moths showed up within a few seconds,"So I opened up the box, placed the square pink thing in the middle. I open up the pantry and all of a sudden 4 moths flew out with the box still in my hand. I set it down inside the pantry and saw them go in....the 1st day i caught about 5. A week later I had about 15. I did see one or two go in and not get stuck though in the glue."
1,Does not attract moths,"I have many ""pantry moths"". This safer brand product does not attract any of them. I am very upset because the other safer products that I have used are outstanding... this one is a let down..."
3,one out of two was okay,"There are two traps in the pack. One of them worked really well and caught a couple dozen moths. The other one apparently had bad glue because most of them would land, struggle a bit and get out."
2,Safer Brand Pantry Moth Trap,"Three weeks after putting out Four traps, we caught exactly FOUR moths in the traps. We killed another THREE DOZEN by hand. If these four were the ONLY males, it must be a happy life for them, i.e., if they don't get caught in traps..."
1,Safer moth control is no good,I have returened the item because it didn't catch any Moth Fly in 15 days while another brand I got on the same purchase was filled with stuck Moth Flies. (SpringStart BioCare ) is the best. it keep catching more and more Moth every day.
1,"Used to work, doesn't anymore","We used Pantry Pest for several years and it used to do a good job of controlling the occasional infestations of flour moths, but they've changed the design of both the box and lure and now they're crap. The adhesive, while nice and sticky, has been shrunk to two tiny patches and the lure is a thin rubber square that you toss onto the adhesive instead of the former round packet. The moths don't seem too impressed with the little square and neither are we. I'm trying other brands now, the Springstar one has generous adhesive and a square that seems to actually work for instance, Catchmaster is next. No more Pantry Pest for our house!"
4,"So far, so good... but found elsewhere for less $$$!","Put it in my pantry tonight, and it caught 2 moths within 15 minutes, so something is working!That being said, I actually bought this at Home Depot for only $5.78+tax! This really casts doubt on Amazon's claim that the list price is $11.11 ..."
1,The only moths this trap caught were ones' I had thrown in the trap!,Doesn't work and I have four of the traps set up all around the house. The only moths in the traps are moths that I had caught and thrown into the trap out of frustration.
3,Not the best trap around.,"This company made some very interesting choices. They put the pheromone bait in a special tiny square of plastic that you have to drop onto the actual sticky surface. What this causes is a mass buildup of moths in that one tiny area of the sticky trap, and no moths anywhere else. Also, the sticky surface of the trap is quite small and doesn't utilize all of the cardboard of the trap. What sticky surface there is is not that sticky at all, actually. I've seen moths fly in, land, get scared, and fly out.There are better pheromone moth traps, like the Pro Pest Pheronet. This one just doesn't cut it."
5,"A ""must"" in our pantry!","I have been using the ""pantry pest"" in my pantry and closets for many years now.It is the most effective product I've used. I recommend it to everyone.C.A. SmallArizona"
3,small stickly area to catch moths,"I've used these before and was very happy with its performance. But with my latest purchase, I was surprised to see the sticky area covers only 50% of the trap size. This smaller sticky catch area means you have to buy this brand more often. I looked at my old traps and most of the trap is sticky, and covered in moths, but they are not Safer brand traps. They work just fine, so I say Safer is not a good deal for the price."
2,Not very attractive to moths,I have two of these in the cupboard where we have a moth problem. The moths are not well attracted to this trap. Previously I used a trap from a seed provider. It was many time more effective than this one is. I'll go back to the other seller.
1,Didn't work for me,"I bought these traps and had no luck whatsoever. I had loads of moths and I had used another brand, which worked very well, but that brand was no longer available. Then I bought this brand and it didn't catch one moth. I used one trap with one square of pheromone. I followed the directions completely. In other words, I don't think the problem was me. I have to wonder whether these sat on the store shelf too long. Anyway I took them back to the store and got my money back.It might be hard to return these if they catch one of a hundred moths and are therefore used and slightly successful. Fortunately for me they did nothing.I now have another infestation and need to do something about it, but I don't know what I'll do as I need a product that is 100% successful, else the remaining moths will replicate."
4,Works great!,"I had a terrible problem with pantry pests, so I looked online for something to solve it. I searched Amazon and decided to try this product. It worked immediately. Took it out of the box, put in the lure and set it down. Those pest started to circle around the little trap and soon were flying in and getting stuck on the adhesive inside the box. Needless to say I am happy with this product."
3,not as good as other brands,"I have used other brands from [...] and had so much better results. This brand did not even catch a moth for over a week! In fact I have seen a few flying around but not going near the trap. With other traps I have bought in the past, mouths were in it within a few hours. I am thinking the hormone is not strong enough or I was sold an older shelf product."
1,Absolute waste of money,"Literally does nothing but take up space. Bugs walk around and are not even remotely interested in stopping in. I'm not sure if the ""lure"" even works. I also don't see how they would actually stick to the box...doesn't seem sticky enough."
2,"A+ for attractant, F- for killing power","The attractant part of this works almost instantly. Within seconds of opening the pouch the moths were swarming. The sticky inside the trap is 100% garbage! Not a single moth got stuck. I watched them get their wings and feet 'stuck' only to easily free themselves again. The sticky is covered in dusty wing prints, but there are none actually stuck. This product gets a 2 only because the attractant made it easier to squish all the moths."
1,no longer a good trap,These have caught hundreds of moths in the past. But the last ones are NO GOOD! I have traps set out and the moths are flying around me! These no longer work. Don't buy these.
1,Complete Garbage,"Amazon should be ashamed of selling this and there are probably a whole bunch of people in China laughing at the people who buy this product. We bought these as a replacement for older moth traps that actually worked and I can't believe the difference. The attracter square is tiny and doesn't attach anywhere while the on-the-trap folding instructions tell you to put it in a non-existing place (I have an idea where they should put their traps), and the sticky trap material is again, virtually non-existent. Total crap. Buy these to send to someone you hate who has moths."
1,Avoid,These traps have caught nothing but dust. I would not recommend this product to anyone who is experiencing problems with meal moths.
2,Does not work,this product did nothing to trap moths. I followed directions and put four traps in a small room and days later no moths were caught.
1,Not Surprised this movie wasnt a success,"The characters were terrible. There was no background on any of the characters and you found yourself wanting to know more about the characters. The acting is really sub par in true bmovie fashion. What really sank this movie is the absolutly atrocious dialogue and the fact that the Russian mob are just a bunch of pushover whiners. It is not believable at all that a ""taxman"" could have accomplished this anyway. The movie is laughable in some parts and incredibly boring for the rest. I'd skip this dreadful movie. I definately had to look at Joe Pantoliano in a much lower light from now on."
3,eh...,"Not sure what everyone is raving about. I watched this movie once, and I was left feeling that they just made a movie for the sake of using some extra film. I thought, ""I'll watch it again, maybe I missed something."" The second time was no better than the first. I suppose all genres have their followings, but I see no point in this movie. There was no real suspense, the characters, while believeable to a point, are unlikable, and the basis of the movie, a tax collector and a rookie cop, seems sort of [weak] to me. It seems like they threw in the russian mafia as an afterthought. While I was running on the treadmill, someone popped the movie in again, and I couldn't escape the 3rd watching w/o stopping my workout, so now I've seen it a total of 3 times and it's still just as pointless to me.I'm not saying it's a bad movie. I'm just saying it's the cinematic equal of room temp water.Give it a try. You might find it more enjoyable than I did."
2,Disappointed,"I went to the store looking for a dance/cardio workout, because I get tired of the same ole routine. I read the back of this DVD and it sounded really interesting. Well, I started the DVD and I was very excited for the first 15 minutes. I was keeping the beat and really having fun. After that, it started moving really fast, without enough time for the ""dancer"" to learn the steps. I had to reverse and play the steps several times before I thought I had it.My other critique is that the cameraman did not show all the dancers. He had a tendency to just focus in on some of the girl's faces, while Gloria was showing the steps. Before I knew it, the ""dancer"" was supposed to be completing the steps, without any instruction.Overall, the first part was fun, but I ended up disappointed with the second part."
1,A dancer,"Based on the reviews that were available last year, I bought this DVD, but I'm disappointed. I was expecting it to ""dancier"" than it is, and something about the production quality bothers me."
3,Entertaining video of an enviable voyage,"A 5-year sailing trip around the world is something many of us dream about. This family pulled it off. The ports of call were interesting as was the commentary. The film is done in the style of ""The Endless Summer"" with narration over a silent film with background music. The one things I thought was missing though was shots of them actually sailing. A 5 year voyage on the high seas and most the shots were of the ports of call. There wasn't a lot of video of the boat sailing at sea and based on the footage they didn't experience any hardships, broken rudders, torn sails or anything else that I am sure added some real drama to the voyage. While overall it is a nice video of a family vacation and it is well shot, I found it to be more a film of destinations rather than sailing."
3,Blue Water,"I actually liked it but I can see how other, maybe younger people would not. It is basically a home video of their trip. It was low budget and a bit grainy, filmed on 8 mm I think. It is very interesting and a bit of a time travel back to the 60's. It's not for everyone, but it was worth the but for me."
1,Blue Water Odyssey,"I suppose my expectations were to get an insight into planning and executing a round the world trip.I got a home movie that was very nice as a home movie- a little dated circ 1980'sIt does show some interesting shots of how it was to sail this Pacific Islands, Australia and BaliAs you can image it was not what I expected and I would suggest that unless you are interested in watching someone else's home movies your should avoid this CD"
2,Maybe early 70's,"This appeared to me to be a very dated DVD about a family that went around the world. There is very little information about the sailing, just about the places they visited. If that is what you are interested in then there will be some fun watching it, but it will be very dated information. If you want to know about their sailing experiences, successes or problems with the boat, etc... look else where."
3,Blue Water Odyssey - a charming amateur production,"Having met the Driscoll family, in the Hawkesbury River just north of Sydney, during their circumnavigation, this film held considerable personal nostalgia for me. I remember them as a charming, good-looking bunch and this film confirms that memory. It is a modest production, a bit of a home movie in fact, but that unassuming quality is charming in itself. The film shows some of the pleasures of a trade-wind voyage, provides glimpses of beautiful, simple places far off the beaten track and of the people who live there, and, above all, creates an intimate portrait of a happy family life. Seeing the kids grow up through the five years it took to complete this circumnavigation is cute. It fact, that's how I'd describe this film - cute, unpretentious and a pleasant 90 minutes entertainment."
1,"Old, Outdated, near unwatchable and I love Sailing","This video was old, outdated, and darn near unwatchable. The music made you put on your eight track and get out your boogie shoes. My wife and I watched it together at first. I watched the entire movie but really wished I had not. Go to Lats and Atts. Get a more up to date movie. Sorry to rain on the parade. I rarely leave a negative comment but someone has to with this film. Run don't buy."
2,Dissapointed!,"Being that my husband and I are getting ready to be full time sailors, I have been reading/watching everything I can get my hands on. This was pretty dissapointing. With a copyright date of 2006 I was expecting a fairly modern sailing video, what I got was video taken sometime in the 70's! And most footage was of the cultures they encountered, not of sailing, as the title suggests. To me, it was a waste of money, i was hoping it was something i could watch over and over....NOT!! Oh, and the home produced music was most annoying."
4,Great album from 3 greats of Australian Music,"This is a fantastic album. Since I bought it it's become my most played on my IPOD. It's a mix of blues, country, heartfelt lyrics sung as only Tex can sing them. It's easy to listen to. Buy it - you won't be sorry."
3,Shea Butter Hair Mask,"This is a thick rich conditioner. It does provide moisture for your hair, but it requires you to leave the product on your hair for 10 to 20 minutes. It appears for me that the 20 minute range provided more moisture for my hair.This product contains parabens and propylene glycol.Made in the US"
1,HORRIBLE!!!!,I wonder if this is really fekkai. It feels like glue in your hair. I can't comb it and it feels raw and brittle. I can't believe this is Fekkai!! I would not buy this product. I had to use shampoo and conditioner after using this to remove all the residue. Trust me..this is not a good product!
5,A Good Resource To Have!,"Mark Dever has compiled a collection of sermons for each book of the Old Testament. What this provides is a very readable, easily understood summary of each book, as well a concise treatment of the overall message of the Old Testament.What is most helpful is the fact that sound, biblical theology is maintained throughout. When studying a passage of scripture, it is easy to get caught up in a verse or two and miss the ""forest for the trees."" This book is helpful in placing a passage in a theological context.This is an excellent resource to keep on hand. When studying from a particular book of the Old Testament, Dever provides a great place to start.I highly recommend this for any Christian's bookshelf; clergy or laity."
4,"Overall, a good video compilation...","This latest T&N video compilation (Vol. 5) is already available at most Christian stores. Anyways, Vol. 5 has two additional videos not listed on the back (one by Plank Eye and one by Joy Electric). Vol. 5 is better than Vol. 4 in that they cut down on the behind-the-scenes stuff. All the videos are good. My favorite ones in particular are ""Chase The Sun"" (The Supertones), ""Rock And Roll Star"" (Fanmail), ""Goodbye"" (Plank Eye), and ""Children Of The Lord"" (Joy Electric). ""Children Of The Lord"" has to be the most visually creative of the whole bunch. Overall, a great compilation."
5,Intoxicating,"Isabelle Huppert and Vincent Martinez are superbly cast as victims of co-dependence. School of Flesh inverts the older-man young-woman theme and flavors it with contemporary nuances. Here we have an affluent older woman who gets off on the power money afford her, and a younger ambitious young man who prostitutes himself in more ways than one. This is no doubt a moral tale, though thankfully the director allows the viewer to make up his own mind about who abuses and who is abused, who is good and who is bad. The final scene is devastating, perhaps the best I've seen of films in this genre. Also, Isabelle Huppert is stunning--you may fall in love with her."
3,school of flesh,"I enjoyed this film! An older woman falls for the passionate eyes of a young bartender. She becomes a prisoner of her desires for his love. The aloof, yet caring and secretive persona of the young gentleman only adds to the anquish she experiences as love emotionally tears at their identities. The plot has interesting twists and turns. A good departure from hollywood."
3,Huh?,"First let me say that I am happy to see a movie for once that has an older woman falling for a younger man (such a rarity!). However, it seemed so sappy. Why is it that the older woman named Dominique, played by Isablelle Huppert, has to look so desperate to have a man to the point that she becomes completely dependent on her live-in lover, Quentin, and has him move into her apartment almost immediately after meeting him. In other movies, you never see the older man becaming a parasite to his young girlfriend, and tending to her every need like in this movie. This was obvious a movie written and directed by a man!"
2,I kept wondering....,"What was the point of this film? In my opinion, it may get some play because of the nudity, but I'm sure that wasn't the point. The realities of class distinction, the flawed mixing of religion and politics, and grinding poverty are addressed, but weakly. I wasn't able to lose myself in this film. The acting seemed stilted and I was bludgeoned with characterization.This is not the first European movie I've viewed, nor will it be the last. But I really expected more."
5,Wonderful music!,"My exposure to South African music is limited (think Ladysmith Black Mambazo, or Paul Simon) and so are my qualifications to review it. But at the very least I have to tell you that I love this collection. It has opened up a new world of music to me, with harmonies and rhythms that are infectious. I strongly recommend it."
1,The Man Who Knew Too Much,The cover has Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day on it. Naturally one would expect them to be in in. WRONG! DECEIVED!!! Do NOT buy this version!!!!
1,Would give no star if possible,"Very poor footage, you will hardly see any natural view of this beautiful region. It's all about U.S. tourists looking for all the facilities they're used to, shops selling U.S. junk food ... They always show you tourists drinking, eating, sailing, riding ...Where is the ""paradise"", the ""best kept secret"" in all that?Mexico is not that, Yucatan is not that!"
1,HORRIBLE,"Don't waste your money on this. Trust me, the second the DVD was finished I threw it away because I know I'll never watch it again."
1,Dreary and condescending,"What a disappointment from Rabbit Ears, usually the purveyors of stellar children's entertainment! This video was condescending, boring, bombastic, and, in some places, the illustrations didn't even match the story. My four- and six-year-olds hated it, and asked to turn it off."
3,"great story, awful sound quality","The story is lovely, but the sound quality on this video is atrocious. Three adults and a child all watched it at two different homes (different equipment) and all agreed: what's wrong with the SOUND? Be prepared to narrate what's happening FOR your child, who won't hear it all. It's a calm, relaxing video using stills of the book's illustrations and Grant's voice-over narration that you can't understand. If you're WILLING to narrate it youself, it has a good message about cooperation and living with love."
5,Nothing 'light' about this!,"This is no wimpy wannabe, commercially-acceptable jazz 'act' by any stretch of the imagination. It's Contemporary Jazz music at its best, true to its roots. Flora Purim's breathy vocals accent each piece perfectly without getting in the way of Chick's keyboards or Airto Moreira's drums. ""500 Miles High"" and ""Spain"" are great, but give ""Captain Marvel"" its due. Though the sound is dated, this is without question, one of the greatest jazz recordings of all-time."
3,"The playing is good, but the vocals . . .","Chick delivers a fine album musically, with some terrific solos on the electric piano, but I must agree with some of the reviewers on here that Flora Purim's vocals can be downright awful on all the pieces she sings. Her voice sounds flat and off key, and you can really hear her struggle with her accent and her English throughout the album. It sounds as if she is struggling to hit the note and sustain it in all the songs. This is truly disappointing and I cringe because the music is so good and tightly composed. I think the later Return To Forever is better and I'm going to have to sell this one back."
5,Ray rocks!,Great job Ray - you rock! I'm really proud of you! We went to school together and I'm blown away by your music!Hope to see you soon - maybe at our 20th H.S. reunion?
3,"When it's good, it's very good...","As a longtime fan of George's who has always felt his work is grossly under-appreciated, I have to say that this Cd has some of his best singing in years as well as more of the pseudo-rock posturing that I didn't care for from Cheapness & Beauty. However there are those who do appreciate this Bowie/hard rock sound that George has been fond of lately.I'll always prefer his ballads and midtempo songs where George's knack for melody and lyrical vocal style shines best. Can anyone deny that In Maya is one of the most beautiful songs he's recorded in years. Number One is blissfully reminiscent of his glorious Culture Club years.I absolutely love Spooky Truth, his duet with Eve Gallagher. and Mr. Strange is lots of fun.For anyone not familiar with George's folk-acoustic style these days, this will probably be a pleasant surprise."
1,"If only I could vote ""0 Stars""","I am continually disappointed in Boy George. He has such potential, yet puts out what is in my opinion, pure crap. The songs on this album are dreadful. The lyrics are embarassingly poor and the music is the same bad glam rock as his last full album (which should have been scrapped with the out takes this album consists of). Boy George has done some brilliant vocals when put in the hands of producers like Faithless and the Pet Shop Boys, and his latest singles ""When Will You Learn"", and ""Love Is Leaving"". I was hoping he would release an album in that vein. In my opinion, Boy George should stick with electronics and dance music, and leave the the guitars in his garage."
1,"I find that I don't like the ""Challenger"" cyle of Trek...","...any more than I do the ""New Fontier"" cycle. Both are built on a premise of a Long John Silver clone skipper and his raffish crew of square wheels. There's a growly amazonian officer here who decks her captain without really being in mutiny--presumably it's ""for his own good"". In the ""New Earth"" series this book is a sequel to, Starfleet pulls the cliche Cold War era stunt of taking sides in a nasty regional conflict in which neither side--Blood Many or the Kauld--are particularly civilized. In this book, a Bood Many ""guest officer"" tries to impose his culture's strictures on a Fleet vessel when an officer disobeys an order--their penalty for that is death...This is definitely beneath what I've come to expect from Diane Carey..."
1,Diane's first disappointment,"Usually knowing that a book is by Diane Carey is knowing that I'll really enjoy it. However, I was unable to finish this book. I tried and gave up halfway through. I found the alien culture confusing, and I did not care for the ""Starfleet"" characters. I had started in on the New Earth series and gave up on them. They do not interest me at all. I will not read any more New Earth/Challenger books."
2,I don't know anyone in this book!,"Ok, having now finished the book, I am still giving it two stars. I still didn't know any of the characters in this book, but it leaves off with a major cliffhanger. The descriptions in this book are many and varied, the technical stuff is very technical and the descriptions about the people and their culture is very skimpy, especially about the Blood. I would've like to known more about this culture and what makes it tick, and why the Federation is out there in this area.Thanks for reading!~Pandora"
4,Rock Comes Full Circle,"The Greenhornes ""Dual Mono"" is a definite must have for the true ""Garage Rock"" fan. With frontrunner Garage rock bands, like The Whitestripes, The Strokes, and The Vines, getting well deserved national attention more and more people are learning that modern rock had gone as far as it could go back in the early 90's. Now bands are going back to the era of music that revolutionized the industry. The 60's and the British Invasion. The Greenhornes do a fantastic job of capturing the finer parts of that era in ""Dual Mono"". Yet they are one of the best kept secrets in Garage Rock. I think they may soon step up where they belong, alongside The Strokes and The White Stripes."
5,Smoky Mountains Mysteries,I am rereading this book again. I learn something new each time I read it. Love the book. I remember reading a book The Rosewood Casket by Sharyn McCrumb about No Carolina and some Folk Lore. I have reread it twice.
4,mexican way,"Well, this is in my opinion the best period of Mahalia's carrer (1955). Her voice is still strong and too expressive. The songs let her ""touch"" us in a special way. It's a good oportunity for young people to listen the background's soul singers."
4,Holy Holy.,Most people have heard of mahalia jackson but do not listen to her try this cd you will like it.
1,Empire Of Assassins,"I dont do reviews I let people decide what they like and dont like, but this movie is so bad (and I'll watch a bad movie if it entertains me)it pissed me off. I watched the whole thing when I realized Yuen Biao was in it (for all of 2 minutes.) I cant add anything that hasn't already been said. One star is still to high, I would give it a minus 5 if i could. Watch at your on peril you have been warned"
1,Not Worth The Money or Time!!!!!,"Thank God I didn't pay more than $5.00 for it!!!! Saw the movie at WalMart for over $15.00. The movie is not worth the money!!! Movie is very choppy (pun intended!!), somewhat hard to follow, and cheesy. Looks good on the cover, but that is about it!! Save your money and buy something better made like Azumi (Part 1 & 2) or 14 Blades!!"
5,yes sir,"works great perfect service , fast shipping , and just the way a was describe highly recommended , works super ,"
1,"It's posted under NEW, what you get is a REFURB","I only shopped ads that said NEW when I needed to re-stock cartridges for all my printers. Although the low price is normally a tip off, there are a lot of NIB products offered at seriously low prices, so I clicked and paid. What I received wasn't new, but refurbs. Don't think it is ethical to post the product under the NEW only heading, then mention in the fine print of the description that they're re-manufactured. To be fair, the first cartridge works; however, it's not the price, it's the principle. Caught me once for not reading every line, but never again."
3,New versus recycled,"A print cartridge is a print cartridge, and it is not clear to me why I continue to buy some of them brand-new, as opposed to the considerably cheaper recycled ones. So far, I have had no problems with any of the recycled cartridges that I have bought."
1,Refill Your Own,"Refill your own cartridges for pennies. These HP prices are ridiculously high. Refill ink from STRATITEC is excellent. Try it, you'll like it. Be careful not to overfill. I try to use about half as much as I need for a complete fill. This works out well.Start learning with black. I have refilled the same 56 black cartridge dozens of times. Be neat, and keep the cartridge case and connectors clean with rubbing alcohol. Plain cellophane tape covers the fill hole nicely.Color can be trickier, but just as successful. Use a toothpick to identify the colors in the holes under the label. The label color diagram is reversed on the 57. Stick the toothpick into the foam, and identify the ink color by the stain."
1,Totally Failed to perform,One of them arrived damaged on the printer head so did not even print one page. The other one did not print as many pages as I'd expected. Besides the color fades away too fast. Contacted the company without any reply. You'd better go for the genuine HP product.
4,HP 56.... typical bundle,This product is the same you'd buy at Wal-mart or Staples... just more convenient to buy it online.
3,BIG BOWL,"I got this as a gift. I wanted a serving bowl enough for 4 people that I could set on the table. This bowl is HUGE. Its the type of bowl you'd bring to a party with an antipasto salad inside. I don't make that much pasta for our family of four, so I am disappointed in the size. Other than that it is a beautiful set. Just make sure you have big eaters in your house or you go to a lot of parties...then you will love this set."
5,Great insights for those who recognize we are reliving the 1930's,"Lyons' insights into the liberal/leftist mindset, from the perspective of the 1930's, is simply astounding as it relates to today's events. Although writing in 1941, he aptly describes the prevalent attitude of the recurrent limousine/latte liberal set as ""down with us"" and proceeds to demonstrate how their naivete repeatedly led to them being manipulated by totalitarian thugs. The parallels with events in the 1960's and today are incredible. The book is also extremely well-written and balanced. It is thoroughly readable and names the names, exposing the hypocrisy of The Nation, the New Republic and so many others defenders of the indefensible, the men and women who let themselves be used so as to assuage their own guilt for living so absurdly well, as Lyons puts it."
5,Dream Big! A Woman's Book of Network Marketing,"""Dream Big is both practical and inspiring. It brims with the kind of insight and authority that can only be gained through first-hand experience on the frontlines of entrepreneurial battle."""
4,"Easy read, and informative.","It wont take long to figure out that publishing your dissertation is a series of loops that must be jumped through. Germano is great at explaining the loops. The book changed my direction, which is to skip the traditional publishing approach and self publish. It may not carry the prestige, but it is a hell out a lot simpler."
2,"Short, but Repetitive and Long-Winded","This book is short and a quick read, but even at that it's a real waste of time. The author repeats himself over and over again throughout the book. And what he's repeating was barely worth saying once - double space, think about the title, you have to revise your dissertation and don't just send it to a publisher as is. As a matter of fact, that's pretty much all the book has to say. If you want a more serious book that will actually help you understand how editors think, get Rabiner's Thinking Like Your Editor. It's not specifically for the academic book market, but it's both more informative and a better read."
2,Meh...,"As others have pointed, for such a short book, it made me incredibly impatient because practically half the book was full of advice a person who has written a dissertation knows already. I found little of value till page 70, where the author mentions a suggested timeline for various types of revisions. It's a cheap book and a quick read, but don't expect much. Incredibly, for a book on writing, the writing is nothing to write home about. Strewn with slightly awkward attempts at humor, which add little of value and betray a largely indecisive ""voice."""
2,Save your money,"This book appears promising yet falls woefully short on delivery. Most of the info in the book you already know or can learn from a myriad of other books or sources. It promises to show you how to become an internet pornographer yet tells you little or nothing about how to set up a website, find hosting, payment options or any of the other nuts and bolts needed to be succesful. The info on where to find models is no mystery, just common sense. What to pay models was a bit interesting but the advice to pay by check is accounting 101. All in all I give it 2 stars which is a shame, a colaberation with someone wed-savvy may have made this a winner."
1,SCAM,"This book offers no real information or practical steps to actually start your business. It mentions all items in passing (usually no more than a paragraph on any subject, some of whihc ar eimportant). Definetly not going to get you get started. And there is absolutely ZERO useful information on finding models."
4,Interesting and informative,"It reads like a very practical guide for would-be pornographers. That is both a plus and a minus, because it doesn't take much to see that it is probably an uphill climb to make any sort of decent income this way. Lots of work, lots of challenges, and you are not at all likely to do this secretly or on the side."
5,Great Camera,"Very solid camera, but a bit heavy. Good battery life. It is a very professional camera."
4,Quick and powerful but sensor dust is unfortunately there,"I bought the camera based on weather proof, speed and sturdiness reasons. I have no complaint on the speed and the autofocus capability. Even though the picture quality looks no different from 30d, I feel that the camera delivers much better auto-focus effect and the speed. In an ideal enviornment, you will not find the edge of 1d mark ii N. HOwever, 1d mark ii N shines when the low light, quick focus, good battery duarbility are required.The thing bothers me about the camera is not the size and the weight. It is the sensor dust. Why will a weather proof camera collects dust no differently from 30d? After 1000 pictures, the senor dust showed up. I thought the sand, dust should be avoided since the camera is ""weather proof"" - against water, sand, dust. Why is there dust so pravellently accumulating? If there is no dust or the dust can be easily removed from the sensor, I will give it 5."
1,War on the Homefront,"If one wishes to know what the war was really like on the homefront in America, do NOT BUY this DVD collection. I expected it to be newsreel footage from the war years together with hopefully an informed linking commentary.The films included are almost all Government instructional or promotional films hoping to persuade the public to buy war bonds etc. Laudable as their purpose might have been, when originally produced - they tell us almost nothing about the War on the Homefront.Buy a book instead - that's what I did."
4,A rag-tag squadron with deadly punches.,"An action pack story that takes you into one wild ride to another. You will either love or hate characters in the story, but sooner or later you will join them with fierce excitement and laugh with them at times. The author provided many types of character with personality and good humor. The only thing I wish the author would have done with the story was to have more menacing and down outright cunning Imps. For the most part I really enjoyed the story."
5,Another exciting look at the X-Wing series,"Alston continues the exciting stories involvig Wedge Antilles and other X-Wing pilots. Instead of following Michael Stackpole's previous stories, Alston shows Wedge creating a new X-wing squadron called Wraith Squadron (hence the title) and the pilots are not picked for their flying skills, but for their inexperience in flight combat. Wedge seeks to train them into a comando unit as well as an X-wing squadron. Fans will be interested to know this story involves Warlord Zsinj who is later featured in Courtship of Princess Leia. this book is a good starting point for new readers, and a must read for fans of the original series."
5,Creative and Adventurous,"Celtic music like you have never heard it!One of the most creative and adventurous recordings I have heard (which also means: Purists Beware). This is Celtic music but is hybrid and transcendent.The first (and title) cut involves dueling electric guitar and bombard, voices samples or other ""found"" effects, heavy percussion, superb musicianship, and remarkable tunes; all of which should tell you what you need to know about this marvelous recording. And there is more to come as you listen (""Kerminy Breo"" is guaranteed to be a tune you can not get out of your head). Most highly recommended. Youenn Le Berre and Robert Le Gall are brilliant."
2,"Not DTS, Not even a good picture","I have learned a big lesson through the purchase of this video, some groups will show their fans respect and give them DTS with high quality video. Not the case here. This is simply a VHS version recorded to DVD. Not to brag but I could have done this in my basement and produced better quality. If you do not believe me, purchase this DVD then purchase the The Eagles - Hell Freezes Over. I guarantee you will want you money back."
4,Great videos!!,"Only problem I have with this tape is you only get 3 David Lee Roth era videos!! I know they did mostly live videos before that, but Oh Pretty Woman would have been a bonus. You get 13 classic VH videos. VH once said when Sammy joined they could never top Dave in the video showman ship department. So why 10 Sammy videos guys? Still worth it for any VH fan!! Also be warned, if your after the ""Dreams"" video with the blue Angels in it, this does not have it. The version is the live version they released in the early 90s, live at the Wisky:( Hot For Teacher is my all time favorite video and it does have that!! Rock on!!!!!"
4,Not Enough...,"The disc kicks off with the old film lead that started ""Jump"" and keeps on rolling through the final icy scenes of ""Without You."" Every video is just like you remember, except for a new version of ""Dreams"" (featuring the 1993 suprise show at The Whiskey in Hollywood to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the VAN HALEN release).The only knocks are: not enough Diamond Dave (the 1984 videos ""Jump"", ""Panama"" and ""Hot For Teacher"" are the only DLR on the disc); and no filler material (one video follows the next with no out-takes, behind-the-scenes shots or interviews).On the plus side, the DVD version includes the only video featuring just-departed Gary Cherone. And like any DVD, the picture and sound blow away the VHS version of this release.Well worth the discounted Amazon price, VIDEO HITS VOLUME I is a great addition to any Van Halen fan's collection."
3,Sky's the limit... well so is this DVD,"OK, we all love the video's that Van Halen has pumped out thru the years and yes I did purchase this DVD, but this is missing some key elements. Did you know Ive seen videos/live clips for ""Hear about it Later"", ""Unchained"", ""If this is Love"", ""Runnin With the Devil"" ""Eruption/You Really Got Me"", ""Jaimies Cryin"", ""Pretty Woman"", ""Im the One"" and others just from MTV alone. I'm confused with the Van Halen archives. It seems that Warner Bro's is waiting until were all deceised until they release a good DLR erra DVD compilation or live show. Believe me, the bootlegged ""Us Festival"" I have is good, but I'm tired of dealing with dealers online and at record swaps for a taste of something that should be legally released from the industry pigs. Is there an answer in sight?"
2,Needs the Roth Era!!!!!!,"Even though the 78-84 era has few videos, there were a lot of mainstays on MTV: (Oh)Pretty Woman, Dance the Night Away, Unchained, and Hear About it Later. There have also been promo videos from 1978 for Jamie's Cryin', Running with the Devil, and You Really Got Me. There are also tons of live footage of that era of VH. Hagar has been covered in Live Without a Net and Right Here Right Now, but the Roth era exists in 10th gen bootlegs or the 3 videos on the DVD. It's not a comprehensive ""greatest hits"", and with some creative director, a more complete ""hits"" (and fix the sound!) could be released, doing it justice. Add the MTV ""Lost Weekend"", the US Festival portions, some commentary, and some eggs, it would be an awesome package. If you're a Hagar fan, give it 4 stars. If you're a VH or Classic VH fan, it's 2 stars."
5,David Lee Rocks!!!,"I received this dvd from my 24 year old son for Christmas 2004. It is great. I still long for the days of the original group with David Lee Roth on lead vocals. Hagar is good but I'll always consider the ""real"" Van Halen to include Diamond Dave. It's a shame such talented musicians can't get along and just make great music like Eddie and the other guys could still do. Although only 3 of the videos include Roth (Jump, Panama & Hot For Teacher) this dvd is a must for all Van Halen fans."
5,Van Halen ruled the world,"Ok, this is what you get on this DVD :1. David Lee Roth in his VH videos. Sound is excellent2. All Sammy's videos with VH. Super sound and picture.3. Gary Cherone (ex-Extreme) with VH. super sound and pictureVan Halen is like a rock kingdom which changes and chooses it's ministers for certain period of time. If you're really VH fan, you'd already have this DVD. If not, go ahead and buy it. Eddie Van Halen rules."
1,Never buy this,"This was a DVD that came up under a search for the Blue Angels ""Dreams"" video from 1986 and was preported to contain this video. I bought this for my two year old because he loves to watch the Blue Angels jets. It was a big disapointment to see that the video was some other one."
3,"+ 1 from Van Hagar fans, -1 from Classic VH fans","I think if you like Hagar after Dave, this is pretty comprehensive as far as videos go. Hagar could easily put his own video collection out including his pre-MTV era solo and Montrose stuff.It puzzles me as to why they chose to go with just the ""1984"" era material. There were promos shot for the first album. ""Dance The Night Away"" was a live promo. ""Loss Of Control"", while not on the CD version, would've been funny to watch (You Tubers can find it). ""And the Cradle Will Rock"" did have them lip syncing on a TV show. 3 promos from ""Fair Warning"" were MTV staples, and let us not forget ""(Oh) Pretty Woman"" that was taken off of MTV due to controversy.It's not a bad collection, but other than ""Without You"" with Gary Cherone (VH III) , not much focus on making this a jam packed collection of hits and rarities that it could've been. ""Best of Bowie"" it is not."
2,Library staple,"Yes, Dave only made three, and ""Panama"" is the best. Sammy made great contribution to VH's success but you just don't care about him and those video's,although, O.K.-good video's. Then there is the last one with Gary Cherrone. All together now-""WHAT WAS VH THINKING?"""
2,could have been better,"THIS IS ...GOOD FOR FANS WHO LIKE THE POPULAR STUFF, BUT DIE HARD FANS THE ONLY VIDEOS THAT ARE EXCITING ARE HUMANS BEINGS AND THE LIVE DREAMS, NOTHING ELSE IS RARE , THAT YOU HAVENT RECORDED A 1000'S TIMES OFF MTV. THERS A LOT MISSING INCLUDING THE BLUE ANGELS DREAMS VIDEO AND QUITE A FEW OTHERS (NOTABLY 111). GEEZ THEY COULD OF PUT ON SOME OLD LIVE VH STUFF, TO BE INTERESTING OR HAVE SOME INTERVIEWS.TIMES LIKE THESE I WISH I WAS A KISS OR BONJOVI FAN , THEY GET MULTIPLE VIDEOS WITH EACH ALBUMS, AND SEEM TO PUT SOME EFFORT INTO THEM .SINCE DAVE LEFT THE ENTERTAINMENT HAS DIED."
3,A pretty good Van Halen item,"Van Halen has a small but distinctive folio of hits. Whether on CD or DVD, they recur with consistency, as the band is great but not the most productive. This DVD on that basis is solid, fine, even OK. There are better recordings, and worse. You won't be sorry if you buy it, just take the time to see if your favorite hits are covered. Some of mine were not so I had to buy another DVd to complete my library. You also have to take note of the David Lee Roth and post-DLR years, depending upon whether you liked him or not. So, check the Amazon detail page or the review by Amazon that gives details and see if this one or others is the right one for you..."
3,Pretty Decent collection..too many songs left out,"this is a nice collection of hits, Panama, Jump, Hot for teacher, etc. but too many great songs are left out like Running with the Dev, cradle will rock, and Everybody What's up, etc. Shoulda been longer also."
4,No real surprises,"I agree with all statements made in prior reviews, except the one about the edited videos. The videos were not edited for this DVD -- they are shown exactly as they were played on MTV. Unfortunately, MTV and record execs force many bands to shorten their songs for both radio and video airplay in order to allow more time for other songs and, of course, commercials. That being said, this is a good collection of videos for any Van Halen fan. I was somewhat surprised that ALL of the VH videos were not included in the collection, however, which explains why I am not giving it 5 stars. Notably absent were the videos for ""Feels So Good,"" ""Top of the World,"" ""Amsterdam,"" and ""Fire in the Hole."""
4,"Overall, a decent video hits dvd","It's hard to capture an era. My only complaint with this dvd (and it's a minor complaint really), is that people might miss how important david lee roth was to Van Halen's success. For those of us who were there when Van Halen first came out, it really was David Lee Roth who *seriously* helped push them to the top - his flamboyancy and vocalizations helped provide that ""entertainment value"" which makes nobody groups into somebody groups. As the phrase goes, it's a heck of a lot harder to break into the big time than it is to stay in the big time, and david lee roth is part of why they made it into the big time (could've they with sammy? I seriously doubt it). This is a decent dvd, but don't trivialize how important david lee roth was wrt them reaching the big time.Nonetheless, it is nice to have at least some of those old-time van halen sights/sounds still available for our viewing pleasure."
2,Not my dreams come true,"Well, I'll be honest, I was looking for an opportunity to buy the MTV video, ""DREAMS"" with THE BLUE ANGELS footage. Oh my goodness, it's the best video ever made, this DVD however contains a live jam of the band at some venue instead. What a major dissapointment. I would have the price I did for ONLY the DREAMS - BLUE ANGELS VIDEO ""ALONE"". But instead I get this.No this would have warranted a ""1"" rating, but the Right Now vid, bumps it up 1/2 point and the collection of the rest up another 1/2 point. Heck even the Humans Being vid cuts out all the Twister footage the original video contained.So I'll stick with the rating of ""2"" and shake my head in utter discust at the idiot that put this package together without including THE BLUE ANGELS video footage, what is your problem anyway?I'll now have to wait until some brilliant entrepreneur at MTV top put some 80's video package together that will include this AMAZING video of multi-angle plane mounted camera footage."
2,Die Hards Only,"If I could have previewed this DVD before I purchased it. I never would have clicked on the ""Buy It Now"" button..I am a big fan of VH, but was very disappointed. There are 14 tracks on this, the first 3 are David Roth, and the rest are Sammy Hagar. I happen to like Sammy as a solo performer, but I could only stomach a couple of these videos..pretty much crap, in my humble opinion..Let The Buyer Beware..."
4,"Five stars, not four, once again","This DVD begins with Roth & VH performing JUMP, then PANAMA, then HOT FOR TEACHER, a great collection of their early videos. But those are the only 3 Roth videos on there --- GET OVER IT!!! You people who think that Van Halen's career was over when Sammy came in, you just make me SICK!!! WHEN IT'S LOVE, RIGHT NOW, CAN'T STOP LOVIN' YOU, DREAMS.....these videos (and songs) are outstanding, not to mention ALL the others with Sammy, but you people seem to think otherwise. Shame on you. Shame! FFT! FFT! FFT-FFT!."
4,Hagar Rules!,"Great DVD, You get 3 DLR vid's to start out. Then the ""Real"" Van Halen kicks in with some awesome vid's from Hagar. Over all its a great DVD. It would have been nice to see a few others that they couldnt add to it.. but all in all, its great.Van Halen 2004 Tour ROCKS!!"
2,VAN HALEN AND THE COMRPOMISE,what ever happened to...David Lee Roth?This band would not be if it wasn't for him and no matter how many hits Sammy Haggar helped make...it just doesn't make sence to exclude Diamond Dave! Van Halen's one of teh few bands in History that has been able to go through two singers and still have huge success.I think I will stick to the bootleg material. At least they offer the early videos that seem to blow away the Sammy era. I think the Greatest hits could have been 50/50 but for obvious reasons it isn't. It si still great to have FINISH WHAT YOU STARTED...I just hope part 2 does that.....
1,Just a very bad grab for cash,"This is a poor effort , gees all the live VH stuff they cld have put on , all the van halen 1 videos , a pathetic effort at best"
2,How Sad,Only three videos with Dave? I would have expected all of Dave era videos including the live stuff and (Oh)Pretty Woman. That would have left room for a Vol 2 with Hagar (who really cares about the Gary era). I'm surprised that the boys would have passed an obvious way to make double the cash and please all of the people. I'll keep looking for an acceptable bootleg.
5,Amazing collection--not found anywhere else!,"This video is the ""real deal"" collector's find for any Van Halen fan! Shows the live show video from Panama and the classic Hot For Teacher. Who doesn't remember that one? Roth doesn't make it on the tape as much as Sammy, but he was around more during the big music video era. Rewind and rewatch the Right Now video over and over and catch all those words you missed the first time. This item will not let you down. Just be glad it doesn't have any of that disgraceful crap from Van Halen III."
2,"""Dreams"" switcheroo stole my money","I bought this DVD specifically so I could get a legal copy of ""Dreams"" with the Blue Angels. At the time I bought it there were no reviews posted here. The Amazon description only showed that ""Dreams"" was on the DVD. So I bought it. Then instead of that awesome video I get the ""swticheroo"" to some video I have never seen and don't care about.The other videos are OK but that is not what I was looking for. Still can't get a copy of the right version of Dreams...."
4,Foundations of Managerial Finance by L Gitman 4th Ed,"This book, with accompaning applications workbook, provide the reader a great overview of Managerial Finance. The workbook problems takes the lessons taught within the book and put them into practical Real-Life applications. I have benefited greatly from both books and recommend them to anyone that may be entering the Managerial Finance field."
4,Foundations of Managerial Finance 4th Ed. by L. Gitman-1995,Both the book and applications workbook will provide any student with a very good Managerial Finance overview. The in-depth problems offered in the applications workbook put the provided concepts into reality.
4,4.5 Stars - Almost Near Perfect,"After reading In Sheep's Clothing, I thought, ""what happened to the way she used to write like in The Upper Room."" This book is very underrated. Everyone should read this book. People being murdered by this one woman named Mama Ruby who plays God with folks lives. For the most part, I liked Mama Ruby but then there were those moments when I wanted her done away with. This book will have your emotions boiling over. I had to read some of Monroe's other books because if they were anything like this one, I knew that I was going to be hooked as a fan. I want my Mama Ruby back. GET THIS BOOK, YALL!"
5,The Upper Room,"After reading ""God Don't Like Ugly"", I was eager to read ""The Upper Room"". Hats off to Mary Monroe for another drama filled novel with unforgettable characters. Mama Ruby was 400 pound amazon with healing hands. Don't cross Mama Ruby or you may come up missing. Pick up a copy and see what all the talk is about. Blessings to Mary."
2,Did not Like,This prequel did not flow for me. Unlike Mama Ruby this story seemed rushed and all over the place. Not one of Ms Monroe's better books.
1,Lost interest,"I only got to the second disc of the CD version and had to just get rid of this. The characters names are so stupid, and the story line is hard to imagine as realistic."
5,FANTASTIC!!!!!,I visualized every single character in this book. I felt as though i was watching a movie. It was an absolute page turner!!!!
5,I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!,"THIS BOOK WAS THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ! MOMA RUBY IS OFF THE HOOK!! THIS BOOK WILL HAVE YOU LAUGHING FROM THE FIRST PAGE TO THE LAST. I ALSO READ ""GOD DON'T LIKE UGLY"" WHICH WAS JUST AS GOOD. MARY MONROE IS ONE THE BEST AUTHORS OF OUR TIME. HER STYLE OF WRITING IS LIKE NO OTHERS. SHE IS IN A CLASS BY HERSELF.IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GREAT BOOK TO READ, THAT IS A NON-STOP PAGE TURNER. THIS IS IT!!"
5,AWESOME BOOK!!,"This book is a true page turner. The UPPER ROOM is funny, scarey, sad and just plain great! Ms. Monroe's writing skills are unlike anyone that I have read. This book was first published in 1985 and I wish that I had known about it then!"
2,DISAPPOINTING PIECE!,"If I had read this book before I read Mama Ruby, I would have never read Mama Ruby. This was one of the most unenjoyable pieces I have ever read. It took me FOREVER (about 3 weeks) to finish this book (and I'm a fast reader when it's something I'm enjoying), but I kept reading it only because I had spent my money on it, and I wanted to finish it and move on to something else. The style of writing I found to be truly strange and it just wasn't an enjoyable piece. It started to get somewhat good towards the end, but it was too late for me. If a book doesn't capture me from the beginning, it's pretty much a wash for me. Sorry Mary; this one just didn't do it for me."
3,Different ....,Mary stretches the truth with this book. Her main character Mama Ruby is a crazy person who claims to be a Christian whilekilling people when they cross her.Mama Ruby raises her children in a choatic and violent home.She stole her daughter from her best friend at birth. Her son helps her bury the dead and keeps his mother's secrets.Mary's use of spellbounding antics makes one understand why Mama Ruby's friends and family fear her.This is a bizarre book with twist and turns that keep you wondering what Mary Monroe imagination comes up with next.
4,Pam's Opinion on The Upper Room,I just got finished reading The Upper Room by Mary Monroe and I have to say that I really enjoyed it. I was looking throughout the bookstore one day and stumbled upon it. It really wasn't my 1st pick but I decided to give it a shot after reading God Don't Like Ugly and God Still Don't Like Ugly. I must say that the book really surprised me. When I first started reading the book I really wasn't that into it and would only pick it up when I was bored but by the end of the book I didn't want to put it down. I really like her style of writing and the book was really superb to me. I would recommend it to a friend.
5,UNIQUE!!!,"The Upper Room was a complete joy to read. All the components in the story were very deep, but not once did I feel heavy reading through all the MESS that went on because of the humor. This book is SHO NUFF HILARIOUS! The dialogue had me CRACKIN' UP!Mary Monroe has birthed a creative cast of characters: MAMA RUBY, MO'REEN, VIRGIL, FAST BLACK, YELLOW JACK, NO TALK, OTHELLA, BIG RED, SLIM, and a host of others. The characters are definitely people you don't want to mess with, especially that MAMA RUBY, who possesses supernatural powers. I can't begin to describe some of the savage activity these people indulge in. Let's just say it's worth the purchase and the laugh.I'll definitely be reading God Don't Like Ugly in the near future.Story above well done Ms. Monroe."
5,right book at the right time !,"I had the pleasure of reading this book in 1986 and loved it and laughed so much. After 911 in New York City, I needed to laught to put my mind on a book that was funny, a bit sad, and so human. Well I found it again in The Upper Room. The details of Mama Ruby are like a tall tale that makes you wonder it was laught after laught and I will not spoil it for any reader. But I hope that Ms. Monroe puts out another book soon.I enjoyed ""God Don'tLike Ugly"" if thats true He sure did not like Mama Ruby but He made her. Its a thought provoking book and so humerous.It helped me to feel safer riding the train from Brooklyn to lower Manhattan daily and helped put a smile on my face and in my heart and realize that our lives like the people at the Goons is in God's hand not anyone elses."
1,Leave It,"I read Mama Ruby, which was an excellent book, but The Upper Room was no comparison.To me The Upper Room was a twisted, unbelievable, disinteresting book which I would barely give it one (1) star.Take my advice; SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
5,Good read,This was a very good read. I couldn't put the book down it keep me going. Mary Monroe is a good author read quite a few of her books.
5,Loved everything about this book!,"I read this book several years ago but after learning of another book ""Mama Ruby by the same author I decided to re-read ""Upper Room"". This book was great from start to finish. Since I'm orginally from Louisiana I could relate to a lot of the things that were mentioned in the books. I will keep these two books in my collection forever and will recommend them to all my friends."
2,"Good idea, bad actions....","When I first started this book, I thought it had the most brilliant plot but as soon as the woman ripped an arm off of a man, it went from being a fiction book to a fairy tale. Science fiction? Comic book? I don't know--I was dissappointed. But I must give the author credit for a good idea character-wise, I just think the actions in the book were a little outlandish."
4,upper room,Very good reading.. each page I was ready to turn to the next page . This was truely a good read from begining to end
1,HORRIBLE!,"Do not waste your time reading this book! You begin reading, hoping that it will get better...it NEVER DOES! The story plot is unrealistic, the characters are unbelievable and it is simply poorly written."
2,Returned. Way too specific for my needs.,"I'm a coach for an after school girls group that trains for a 5K at the end of a 12 week program. I'm a school counselor, NOT a trained coach or PE teacher. I wanted some general advice about helping my elementary girls prepare for the 5K, hydration needs, Pre race meals, etc. This was waaaaaay too specific for me and not helpful in my case."
2,From the Dead of Night,"This is a movie that has nothing to do with the description of the container it comes in. It was nice to see Lindsay Wagner since the days of her ""Bionic Woman"" tv series, but this movie is an odd one."
3,From the Dead of Night,"This was not at all what I expected. It does deal with death and spirits, but it isn't quite as dark as the cover art might lead you to believe. This would be one of those back-from-the-dead movies that I would let my sheltered 10-year old watch. Anyway, it is not one of Lindsay Wagner's best movies, but she still gave a believable performance. I have often considered her to be a better actress than the roles she chose. In other words, I wish she would have done more movies like SCRUPLES and MEG LAUREL and less of this second-rate stuff. So, on a scale of 1-10, I give the movie about a 6, but I give Ms. Wagner a slightly lower than usual 9."
3,lovely lindsay wagner,"this was a tv movie years ago called 'the walkers' i believe, i really like lindsay wagner and actually wish she had done more films, i mean the two seconds she had in nighthawks was not near enough, i think they had to cut scenes out with her and i can thnk of about 5-10 minutes of the sly in class when not only was he bored but so were we! anyway, lindsay is the star of dead of the night thankfully and i was glad to see her with bruce boxleiter more than the guy who played glen (sorry i am to lazy to look it up). it's worth owning for us fans and a good movie. only thing i can say that i would have done is make more with her and bruce and less of the scene when she falls in the pool, we got it, ya know..."
4,Nice accessory,"To Whom it may Concern,I am not too sure if this item has done anything to improve my truck around town. I do however think that it has helped on long trips over 55 MPH. I have gotten bette gas milage for the second tank in a row. I hope this is helpfull to someone.Reinhard"
3,Additional to the Cold Air Intake - ensures cooler air,"Be sure to check the volant website for vehicle and cold air intake compatibility...[...]I found that it does in fact fit my '06 GMC DenaliDespite what Amazon shows for compatibility, it goes well withVolant 151536 PowerCore Cool Air IntakeOnly benefit is to ensure pulling cooler air from outside the engine compartment instead of within compartment or from quarter panel.Something I added especially for cooler air intake during summer months."
3,Very mellow...,"I bought this after all I heard about UFO and definately wasn't disapointed. UFO has a sound that is pretty unplaceable although I would say if you are into this then listen to Manu Chau, some of the less weird stuff by Sukia ('Dream machine' being quite close), Coldcut, and The Herbaliser. I especially reccomend the last two. UFO's album, while at times a tad mediocre, is uplifting and cool all the way through. Stand out tracks are 'United Future Airlines' and 'Doopsyllolic' which is veeery funky. They are a group to watch out for, they are destined for big things. However, if you are new to UFO then I would reccomend their eponymous debut album, very funky with fantastic samples."
2,Background music for mall shopping,"I believed the hype and found this heaven knows how. No, wait, I actually ordered it. Ugh - stupid me. Anyway, imagine my disappointment when upon listening I discovered I had purchased the perfect soundtrack for buying some cute new outfits at The Limited. Coming soon to a mall near you."
3,A dissapointment,"After I read the reviews (all of them five stars) and after I saw that another book of Alice Starmore is out of print and you can get it for $200 I was really looking forward to getting this book! Well... I appreciate all the work the author put into producing those 20 sweaters. Yes, the instructions are very detailed. And the charts are very clear. But out of 20 models featured in the book only one caught my eye as being truly original and worth making.Photographs of the models are very pretty - beautiful landscapes, lovely sailboats... But if you take a picture of a knitted dark blue sweater, don't put it in front of a dark boat - or fix the lighting, so the reader will be able to appreciate the knitted pattern.The book did not live up to my expectations - so three stars it is."
1,Fisherman's Sweaters:Twenty Exclusive Knitwear Designs for All Generations,"Beautiful book! The patterns included are spectular. There is something for everyone. It is definitely not a book for beginners, but it is very inspiring. Well written, wonderful pictures and diagrams. A must buy for those who love ""Fisherman""knits"
4,Gorgeous patterns in interesting designs,"This book is for advanced knitters who can modify the designs to look current using the interesting patterns included in the book. The book contains some wonderful historical information and background, as well as some detailed knitting instructions.Since the book was written in the early 1990's, the designs will create sweaters that are very large and bulky, and will need to be modified substantially to look stylish."
5,Beautiful sweaters,I have wanted this book for years. These are absolutely beautiful sweater designs. The instructions are really clear. As an advanced beginner I was able to follow them quite readily.
5,Tickled by this book,"Gorgeous book, gorgeous patterns. Since the book was first published in 1993, some of the styling looks a little dated to me, but will take very little effort to modernize. Beautiful intricate patterns, including several in finer wool and suitable for indoor wear, and including men's (unisex) and children's patterns.Highly recommended."
3,"Classy looking chess set, but corners don't like to stay down","The pieces are nice and have enough heft to them. The kit looks cool and travels well. Extra queens are included. Easy to fold up and put away. But as I believe some other reviewers commented, the mat doesn't always stay flat. When we unroll it, it looks a bit dog-eared. Fortunately the pieces are heavy enough to weigh it down, but it doesn't look as good. It meets expectations otherwise. But if someone can point me to a chess set with equally quality pieces and a mat that really goes flat once unrolled, I'd like to hear it."
3,You get what you pay for...,"Though I can play chess on this board. This isn't the high-quality product that I was hoping for. Of course, you get what you pay for, and the pieces are very light and the board tends to curl up and has a hard time staying flat. If you're looking for top-of-the-line. Look elsewhere. Still, it's a good deal and it works to play my favorite game."
3,Good Travel Chess Set,"I bought this as a gift, a housewarming present for a friend. It's good, but I wish the pieces were a little heavier and the case were made slightly better."
3,"Very good, but not as advertised...","The only reason I am giving this a three instead of a four overall is that it was advertised as ""solid"" when it is not. I have a solid set (not triple-weighted, just solid plastic) and it is great.This set is single weighted, so durable; and I would recommend it, but it is not solid plastic: it is hollowed a little on the bottom. Still durable, very usable and better than what you will get at any department store. This set is similar to any single-weighted set you would get from the US Chess Federation [...]For kids, I prefer single-weighted to triple-weighted pieces as I have seen triple-weighted break more often than single weighted (the weight on the bottom of the triple-weighted sometimes comes out, and the top sometimes breaks from children's rough handling).In the meantime, i am still looking for another solid plastic set..."
4,Good Product,"Very good product, found as described. Good quality although made in china. wish the roll-up board stays flat when opens up. we had to roll it opposite way every time to keep it flat."
4,Gotta love it!,"4 queens. Medium heavy pieces (decent weight for a travel board). Zipper on the piece pouch is kind of crappy, but it works. I own a standard boxy tournament timer that fits PERFECTLY in its own Velcro compartment. It's like it was made for it. Easily 4 stars."
4,Very good Product,"Chess mat is truly flexible and looks durable. Chess pieces are big, look strong and durable as well. Product comes with a convenient storage bag which is well designed as well to hold both the chess pieces and mat. The manufacturer has thought through things."
2,the pieces are hollow and cheap feeling.,"The description says the pieces are ""solid plastic"". They are not, they are hollow which you can easily tell just by feeling the hole in the bottom. The whole reason I got this was because it is a ""tournament"" chess set, which I've seen and used before and I remember distinctly the satisfying heft and texture of the pieces. Nothing like that here.Honestly, this is a little overpriced and I am considering a return. The bag is nice though."
2,not what was expected,"I expected the pieces to be weighted, they were not. The board was delivered folded, months later it still has crease. I was expecting a shipping tube for the case, i bought a mailing tube for this purpose. Look elsewhere."
4,it's nice work boot,"it os very comfi. and good , i will never buy other kind.i gat it from amazon in relly goog deal.."
5,After a while it's great,"I first heard of Flashlight Brown after finiding them on cdnow.com. I wasn't sure what to think when I first heard them but they had a different sound that wasn't like things that are out now. I went to the cd store and got it for 10 bucks which is never bad. At first I really didn't like the cd, but after a couple listens it grows on you and now it's one of my favorites."
5,My Degeneration,"Somewhere between The Beatles and Rancid you will find the band Flashlight Brown. I have seen them play a few times and their live shows are amazing. They are not exactly pop punk but they do appeal to a wide audience. I am a big fan of the band and I know they make it big so I know I wont be able to keep them all for myself. The guys are all super nice and they are canadian too! My fave song on the album is ""I'll only make you cry"" but in truth they all rock. The cd is high energy and great for teens who are just realizing that yea life...and it is so funny that it does. The cd is worth the low price and then some. GET IT!"
4,This band rules!!!,"I loved this album. Flashlight Brown rocks!!! Canadian punk guys do it again. This album is a breath of fresh air. If you are a fan of Sum 41 or Blink 182, you will definitely like this album."
4,Awesome!!,"This CD is a grreat disk! Being a couple year long fan of Flashlight Brown, listening to the downloads from the site (never able to find a CD!), one can hear the changes that the band itself has gone through. Their new rendition of 'Lose the Shades' is a work of genius, and the same goes for 'Butterball.' New songs, including 'Praise the Day,' 'Go and Die,' and 'I'll Only Make You Cry' (my favourites) are amazing songs. Anyone who loves upbeat, good punkish rock should definantly get this CD!!"
5,Incredibly addictive!,I've just got this wonderful book and I can't put it down! I think I may leave it in my gym locker just to encourage me to go there!
5,Smooth and Transcending,"I love this CD. I couldn't make up my mind on which Chris Botti CD I should buy next. I bought First Wish based on the review regarding the person waiting in his car for over an hour to see who the artist was playing on the radio. I was not disappointed. I love track 2, On the Night Ride, track 4, Like I Do Now, and track 6, Cubism. The whole CD is fantastic.I have been listening to Chris Botti's Caught soundtrack since seeing the movie in late 1996. I love that CD also."
4,Starting his style,"The world famous trumpet player at his first tones, the sound that will remain the same, but will result more mature in the latest recordings. Relaxin' style, uncomparable creation of soft and cool ambients."
2,Drums are annoying,I love Chris Botti -- have lots of his cds. I just bought this one and the drums are very annoying. They are too loud with the same beat over and over. Wish I could edit them out!
5,a great pleasure to read...,"""I picked this book up after being attracted to its wonderfulbook jacket and its words certainly lived up to myexpectations. As a young person, I had never heard of mostof the names in the book, and I am now filled with greatappreciation of the work they did to break barriers on WallStreet. As a person of color, I felt it necessary to learabout the pioneers of the past, and all they accomplisheddespite the obstacles that hindered them. A necessarybook!!!"""
5,Classic Andy Williams,"I grew up listening to Andy Williams, among other artists of this genre. I had not thought of any of this music until recently and did not realize how much I missed listening to Andy. The quality is as good as the quality of any other cd and a great value."
5,It's life!,"I feel like I am reading a real life story (mine maybe)? about chosing the wrong man when the right one is still there right under yournose. Marriages all go though periods of ""slumps"" and ""skids"". It does take two, working on it, to survive these times. The work can lead to an even deeper relationship as she so aptlytells us in this story. Betty Sahota, College Instructor"
3,No alignment marks,"This aftermarket item did not have the inscribed alignment marks necessary to ensure that it is properly installed on the steering box shaft. It fit properly, but in order to get the alignment correct, it was necessary to compare it to the old arm side-by-side and scribe the new part before it was installed. If, for some reason, you don't have the OEM part to compare it to, you will not have an alignment reference point to enable you to install this part. Other than that, no problems were encountered.Shipping and packing were fine, and the price was very good."
2,"An OK book, but not very interesting.",I did not totally enjoy The Bridge To Cutter Gap. The book is not that exciting and is not very adventurous either. It is pretty good but not the most interesting book I have ever read.
5,aMAZING,"tHIS CD IS ABsolutely amazing. He plays the c- sonata with such fire. Also, listen to his cd of the pathetique. It is the best Ever(the cd is also by emi). Lets hope he finishes recording the whole cycle,"
5,Impressive,"Kovacevich plays with remarkable clarity and control throughout this exemplary recording. His style is completely free from affectation, yet always intense, characterful and energetic. The ""Pastoral"" Sonata in particular has a sublime richness that lingers in the memory. In fact I can't think of any other pianist who combines technical accuracy and interpretive insight in any of these works as convincingly as Kovacevich does. In my humble opinion, a must buy."
