1,WRONG COVER,IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THE EARLY EDITION OF THIS BOOK WHICH THE COVER PICTURE SHOWS ON THE WEBSITE YOU WILL NOT GET WHAT YOU ARE ORDERING. YOU WILL GET THE LATER EDITION. I HAVE ASKED AMAZON TO CHANGE THE COVER PICTURE BUT AS OF TODAY NO ONE IS LISTENING.
3,dont try and rebuild it youself,"i purchased the book and it is indeed a wealth of information. however the jigs and tooling you need to do a complete tranny rebuild properly will cost you way more than you would ever save trying to rebuild it yourself. its just not worth it . hell i had a reputable shop pull mine rebuild it put it back in replaced the mounts cooler lines and facory torque converter and they gave me a 2 yr waranty on it for less than $...hell im an aircraft mechanic and didnt want to attempt the rebuild on my #s matching tranny.Its like Clint Eastwood says ""a mans gotta know his limitations.""."
3,turbo 400 book comments,This book was very thorough BUT is out of date. It needs to be updated by the author(s) and include the revisions that came about in later years.
4,A sensible guide.,"This book covers all you need to know on rebuilding and modifying your Turbo 400 transmission.Every chapter is explained in great detail.Plenty of information,diagrams and photos throughout.If you are rebuilding and modifying your Turbo 400,this is the ideal book to have."
5,Replacement door bell,"- Replaced two door bells that had wore out and cracked- Lighted button makes it easy to see at night- Plastic, but fairly sturdy, installed easy in place of old fixtures- delivered quickly and work just fine!"
4,Indie Brit Rock...,"When they're not promoting Bis, Mogwai, or Arab Strap, the heads of Britain's Chemikal Underground Records (Emma Pollock and Alun Woodward) like to make music for themselves. ""Peloton"" is a low-profile wonder -- it doesn't bowl you over on first listen, but gradually builds until you realize you've just listened to the CD seven straight times. The sound is essentially folk elements brought into the standard two-guitars/bass/drums rock format. But the melodies, musical ideas, and lyricism -- as well as small touches of let's-try-anything -- makes for magical listening. (Think Richard and Linda Thompson, or REM in their ""Fables of the Reconstruction"" era.) I'd give it an extra half-star if only the review form would let me. I've got an import version that includes an 11th song, titled ""The Weaker Argument Defeats the Stronger,"" which I hope is indeed included on the American version."
2,Bad history,"Lord Burlington: Art, Architecture and Life is an attempt to unravel the life of one of England's most celebrated eighteenth century architects. However, Jane Clark's hypothesis that Burlington was infact a secret Jacobite with links to the exiled Old Pretender is pure rubbish. Clark's chapter, 'Lord Burlington is here', is full of unsupported supposition and amateurish guesswork that is quite frankly bad history."
5,The sounds of the season,"This music represents what Christmas joy is all about,the thrill of old favorites presented in top quality form. MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!"
3,WOULD BE HIGHER RATING BUT FOR THE CRAZY NONSENSICAL SHAPE OF THIS TOY,"I didn't know what the toy was supposed 'to be' from the picture and EVEN MORE UNSURE after it arrived.Fairly tough and durable, but the crazy shape (which was neither here nor there from my dog's perspective) made absolutely no 'human sense' and if anything, the shape made it more difficult to toss, didn't go as far, and went in a totally unpredictable direction.My APBT did like it a lot and got higher than average use out of it before total destruction (he destroys all of his toys)."
1,THIS NOT DJ SCREW!,"DJ SCREW HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SCREWED UP INC. IT'S JUST PEOPLE TRYING TO MAKE MONEY OFF HIS STYLE. THE SCREWED UP INC. ALBUMS ARE TRASH. GET THE REAL DJ SCREW ALBUMS OR MIXTAPES. YOU WANT ORIGINAL SCREW, GO TO SCREWEDUPRECORDS.COM. THAT'S ALL LEGIT DJ SCREW TAPES AND CD'S."
1,Don't buy this,"This is only the introduction. What gives? It's hard enough finding Kierkegaard ebooks. Don't play with my emotions like this. BTW, you can read this same introduction online for free."
1,"If you know the Bible Gospels then you know this ""Gospel"".","I was hoping for something new and enlightening. instead it is simply a compilation of sayings that are common to Matthew and Luke. Nothing new, nothing enlightening and only 20 minutes of reading. There's nothing ""lost"" about it either because it already all exists in the Bible and in context. If you want to know Jesus, I recommend you buy a Bible instead."
1,A valid view???,"The book does not make sense. 'Scholars' examine the four gospels and try to invent a common source? How's this for an obvious solution: they are all telling the same story! The entire theory of 'Q' is flawed.Mark is known to have spent extensive time with the apostle Peter (read Peter's first epistle, the fifth chapter, the thirteenth verse, where Peter calls Mark his 'son'). Peter was a first-hand witness of the events of the gospels, as was Matthew, which would account for the similarities between the gospels, while Luke wrote his gospel based on the testimony of eyewitnesses, not his own memory. Is it so hard to believe that two men could view the same events and come up with similar stories?The book was an entertaining read, at least. It's amazing what people come up with . . . ."
4,Scholars May Not Be Impressed,The editors of this book add an interesting note at the end on the subject of the translation of the text. They point out that the sayings of Jesus contained in the book represent a 'paraphrase' since the principal of 'dynamic equivalence' was followed in producing their work. They do not seek a word-for-word translation but rather an overall meaning. Many scholars may be turned off by this approach.
5,A MUST READ for anybody thinking about buying a Senegal!,"I bought this book AFTER I bought my baby Senegal Parrot. Boy how I wish I had bought it before I bought the bird. As a first time bird owner, Guide to Senegal Parrot and Its Family is chock full of very useful information. Topics covered are cages, behavior, diet, talking, etc. Covers just about everything you need to know to have a healthy and happy relationship with your special parrot friend."
4,Senegal gotta have,"I am a first time bird owner and absolutely clueless. But at least I am smart enough to always read up on my newest adventure. This book was great...my senegal was afraid of me, but not my husband. She would run away and squawk. The book told me to turn sideways and wiggle my tungue. It worked! She came right to me, and from reading the rest, we are now best buds!!!"
5,3 Deep: Yes Yes Yes... No No No - It's A Canadian Invasion!,"You are more familiar with this 3 member Canadian pop band than you think... Eddie Cibrian, Joshua Morrow and Chris ""CJ"" Huyer. Recognize any of the names?Eddie Cibrian: plays ""Jimmy Doherty on Third Watch""Joshua Morrow: plays ""Nicholas Newman on the Young and the Restless""CJ Huyer: was in the music group ""Strictly Rhythm"" and was a solo singer.Track Listing:1.

5,new to flipper?,a definate must have for anyone new to flipper...this was the first flipper album i ever heard and it got me hooked! this album captures the raw power of flipper live and will leave you screaming for more.(...)
1,Flipper Rules OK But THIS SUCKS,"FLIPPER Rules, OK? But this CD SUCKS. ""Generic"" Their masterpiece is out of print. Roir markets this album as an assortment of their greatest hits...it is not. This CD has been hands down my biggest disappointment in music EVER. These live versions completely ruin the songs. I've been a Flipper fan since I heard ""Ha Ha Ha"" on AT's ""Let them eat Jelly Beans"". This album is the worst. Tell you what...for your money you would be better off buying the Melvin's Singles...they do an awesome cover of Flippers ""Way of the World""...They also do ""Sacrifice"" on the Melvin's record. Will someone please reissue ""Generic"" and PLEASE do not re-mix it. It was fine the way it was."
2,This record sucks ass,"I should point out that I love Flipper. I love that a punk band can create something so heavy and visceral without playing at the standard breakneck pace. I love the sarcastic poetry of the lyrics and the simple-but-clever rhythms. I love how they violated every rule of punk rock dogma and were still ten times as original as the other crap being made at the time. But this is just awful.I've bought enough live punk records to know what to expect: terrible sound quality, songs that are indecipherable from each other, amplifiers hissing feedback into the microphones, musicians that are too high to perform...Maybe that would be the point with a live Flipper record, because they took pride in driving away fans at their shows. But I buy records to listen to them, not to have as conceptual art conversation pieces. This is so painful that it's like the musical equivalent of a Warhol movie (and the joke's on you)."
3,"Dynamic, Focused, and Inspiring...!","The hardest part of life is making the right choices... Carter-Scott--provides the choices, so, what are you going to do? Radically change your life--by committing to yourself! Radical Change by Ari..."
4,Eye on the Past,"This is a great look at one of the old Fan Created heroes of the past, back in the day I dearly remember hunting down these old ditto and other amateur productions that what they lacked in finesse or production values they more than made up in enthusiasm.This is a good look at one of the more unusual of the Fan heroes."
1,Literally couldn't stomach it!,Tried this for the first time today and the taste was so awful that I vomited 3 times in a row. It was a good thing that it was first thing in the morning and I didn't eat yet. I think I'll try the capsules instead.
3,L-leucine taste,"Product arrived in a timely manner. Product mixed well with the protein powder I always use, but when I added the recommended 1/2 tsp. I found it imparted a very odd taste to the protein shake."
2,Torso too short,"The torso of this top was uncomfortably too short. If you've already purchased this top (sad to say), Solution - wear as an under shirt. lol."
5,Revealing and Insightful,Atlantis Rising is a real revelation of the causes behind our current global crisis. This book also gives us great hope for the future of humankind as our world enters the great transition.
1,Money wasted,"I have read, and I am a firm believer that we co- exist with other Being's, but what I have read in that book is beyond not only my imagination but it is a farce and a misguidance of people, especially the title.If somebody has money to waste for a peace of garbage, go ahead and buy the book, but if you are a person standing on the ground with your two feet, and believe in scientific evidence than don't waste you money."
2,Not good,Not very good. I would not suggest this film to anyone that I know. You would be better off reading a book.
1,A waste of time,At times this movie appears to have been directed by a 10 year old. It felt like a very very long movie. I must say that the way the movie ended surprised me. It was a good ending. But everything in between was painful.
3,Entertaining,"I am not a ""romantic"" movie buff, but I was very intrigued. Made me wonder about the ""what-ifs"" I may have missed in my own life... Wonderful acting."
4,Interesting,"I was confused at first, but as the story went on, I liked it. A ""what if"" kinda story, makes you think."
3,Powerful but not charming,"Three legendary musicians play on this recording of two great piano trios. The playing here has lots of passion but little charm, especially in the Schubert. The tempos are on the slow side which I find to be annoying and there is way too much portamento by the two string players. If I did not know the music, I might think the Schubert was written by Brahms due to the heavily romantic style of the playing here. Schubert may have written some music in the romantic style but he still has to be classified as a classical era composer. Unless you are a big Rubinstein fan, I would choose the recordings by the Beaux Arts Trio for this music."
4,Glass scale,The scale is very accurate and sleek looking. The read-out itself could be made a little brighter and sharper but otherwise a nice product for the money.
1,Fine while it worked,"This was a great scale....for about 8 months. Then it started going crazy.I had been dieting and the scale was showing me losing weight more rapidly than I could have dreamed of. Unfortunately I realized it was only a dream when one day it showed I had dropped about 20 pounds overnight. I pulled out my old dial scale and, well, let's just say I wasn't doing as well on my diet as I thought I had been.After much searching in stores, I was able to locate replacement batteries on line but after changing them, the scale continued to give me highly inaccurate and fluctuating scale readings.So, save yourself the money and find something that will last a little longer."
5,This L-lysine has probably helped me.,"For so many years I have been prone to mouthsores. But after a couple of months taking this food supplement, the occurrence of mouthsores has practically stopped. I give it 5 stars."
2,No effect for me,"I took this supplement to prevent cold sores, but saw no improvement. There also seemed to be no side effect other than the cost of this bottle. Back to my presecription med."
3,Great vitamins - but too big ~,"I've got a big mouth, and yet these are a little big for me to swallow.otherwise, great vitaminsWarm WishesMicah Intrator - Chocolate TherapieChapel Hill, NC (646) 479-2154MicahIntrator@yahoo.comFor All Your Organic Raw Chocolate Needs Please Visit-Out Beyond Right & WrongThere is a Field- I'll Meet You There.~Rumi"
2,L-Lysine 500mg - 50 Tablet,I liked that the product is natural with lessharmful chemical fillers.But I didn't notice any added health benefitfrom taking the L-Lysine.
1,more like BOREDOM UNLEASHED,"Track 1 is a spoken erotic themed tribal track. Stress is a tribal track with a male voice over saying-you guessed it. Stress. The repetitive dubby tribal stuff continues until track 5, with the harder diva vocal of Celeda on a track that is not easily available commercially. Unfortunately, vocals aren't in high demand on the remix of Loleatta, and after that, it's right back to instrumental tribal. Tracks 8 and 9 are both instrumental, but have a more interesting groove and move things along a bit better. Unfortunately, the dullness returns from track 10 through the end. Track times:1. bilingual (6:32)2. Stress (6:23)3. Word is changing (6:10)4. low frequencies (4:40)5. Dirtyfilthy (6:14)6. Crash goes love (6:11)7. Tribal madness (6:10)8. What u got, what u do (6:45)9. Air mail (4:42)10. right behind you (5:55)11. Intruder (6:31)12. The mystery (6:17)"
3,"OK performance, not the best","Bjorling sings beautifully but, to be honest, he gave a much more inspired performance on his 1957 recording of the opera with Renata Tebaldi. Milanov gives a very dramatic reading of the score but as other reviewers have pointed out, her voice just sounds wrong for the role. Merrill sings solidly but is not the most confrontational of Alfios. Cellini conducts an OK but not great performance.I recommend instead the Scotto-Domingo-Elvira-Levine performance on RCA. It is digital stereo AND a finer performance!"
4,"Well sung, but dramatically undercharged","The best Jussi Bjorling I ever heard was in Verdi's Requiem. And no wonder. For all the beautiful voice he possesses, he is a lukewarm actor, sounding most at home in concert, rather than in drama. For me, this was fatal to his Turiddu. To hear Turiddu the way he is supposed to be performed, as one of the most emotionally charged characters in all Italian opera, get Cavalleria with Giuseppe di Stefano."
1,Dont buy!,"if your looking for a cheap gun this is it. it is a cheap gun. i know bcuz i have it and got it off hobbyrton.com for like 10 bucks. whatever u do, dont buy this gun off amazon or from paintball stuff4 less or whatever"
4,"Easy listening, great song writing",This rather unkown artists first CD is a wonderful listening experience. Finally someone has gone back to actually writing songs which are meaningful.
4,Nice cover,"This is a very nice cover. It is thin and light. It keeps rain out. The only draw back of the small size is that the child's feet can easily stick out of the bottom, even for kids less than a year old. For this reason I might prefer the medium size."
4,"Early Martha, Early Motown","These albums appeared before Motown hit on the lucrative formula of building albums around a few hits and then filling the rest with tracks which weren't strong enough to make singles. Here they're trying for real albums with mixed results. ""Memories"" is a thrown-together package to capitalize on a hit, with slim material and spare instrumentation. Heat Wave ups the production qualities but again is Motown feeling its way still. Martha is raw here, pure talent, not yet the singer she'd become but still singing the Hell out of everything. A lot ISN'T here. There was another album planned titled ""Moments to Remember"" that included a fabulous single titled ""Coney Island"" and that didn't make it out, though some of it popped up on the ""Memories"" album and Martha put down enough for several more albums if Motown had wished. This is rough stuff, but enjoyable and interesting as Martha never made a record that wasn't interesting."
1,It made me sick to my stomach,"I ordered two DVD's to help train my lab retriever and get him on the road to becoming a great gundog. Every trainer I have spoken to have all based their training on reward training and we had great results, I just wanted to see how they trained dogs across the pond, my initial thoughts, disgusting. All that happens is the dog is made to yelp each time it doesn't do what its asked oh and, the odd elec shock here and there. I am so disgusted with what I saw, I didn't watch it all and im now approaching Amazon for a full refund. My advice, don't waste your money, treat your dog with respect and kindness and it will work wonders, ours is doing fantastic"
4,A Good Start...,"This is a inexpensive book, and a great way to get up to speed on the Zapatista struggle. I was very please with it when I picked it up. It's ultimately a book of hope and is a inspiring rally call for those around the world interested in opposing neoliberalism and fighting for social justice."
5,Love it,This is the most cutest toy I ever seen.......I hope my baby will love it as much as mum and dad do.....*smile
1,Don't waste your money!,"My 8 month old daughter loved this toy in the store, she was fascinated by the moving ears and songs. However, when we got the toy home, it only played one song over and over and the rattle or clapping did not acitvate it at all...you had to push the button on the hand. So we returned it thinking there was a defect and got a new one. Again, the same problem. Needless to say we are once again returing it. We have tried everything, new batteries, clapping, yelling, everything...it does not work!"
2,Peek N Play Eeyore,"My 1 year old daughter recieved this toy as a gift. I love the concept of all the songs, and the way the ears move. Although our problem was that Eeyore kept falling over!! The head is heavy, so it doesn't balance right. Also, we didn't care for the remote contol rattle to make it work, yes is is also voice activiate, but I know the rattle is going to get lost. It is also hard to turn off, you have to un-velcro the back and turn the switch off. And since it is voice activated, if you have it in your childs room at bedtime, and you have not taken all that time to turn it off, it goes off. I don't think it is worth the money, it is not that great of a toy."
3,ears don't work anymore,"I bought this toy for my baby, it was his first birthday. My son played with the toy, he loved the toy. I loved this toy, until the ears stopped working. We only had the toy for 3 weeks when they stopped moving. The toy still has the music/voice working. But it isn't the same with out the ears moving. He doesn't like it anymore. I don't have the packaging anymore to send it back. I wished it still worked."
1,Creepy Eeyore,"Peek n Play Eeyore??? Try Creepy Eeyore! Do the toy manufacturers ever listen to their toys before selling them? This toy was a gift to my 16-month-old daughter, and he sounds more like a ""dirty old man"" than Eeyore. He asks questions like, ""Hi little baby. Want to play a game?"" in a low creepy voice. I'm sure it was meant to be cute and interactive, but all the adults in the room were rolling on the floor laughing at the toy, while wondering if my daughter should actually play with it. It's humorous, but I don't think I'd recommend it."
4,"Fun, interactive toy for baby.","I was browsing down the toy aisle with my 9 month old son and I saw this on the shelf. I thought it was adorable and my son was looking at it too, so I picked it up. I played the demo and Eeyore played peek a boo and then said, ""I love you, baby."" It was too cute!! My son was reaching for it and I was too, so in the cart it went. Now that it's home I have to help him start it up, he is a little young yet to activate it. He is probably not loud enough for the voice control or the rattle, but I am sure he will be soon enough. I love that it has more than one song and activity. A lot of baby toys just have one or two songs/activities and they do them over and over. This is more of a variety. Plus, it's Eeyore. He is so cute and a lot less done then Pooh. Fun, interactive toy for baby."
4,Eeyore,I just purchased this toy and my little girl loves it! She shakes the rattle and eeyore will play games and sing to her. I have had no problems with this toy. I recommend it to anyone.
4,Cutsie Eeyore,"My 1-year old grand-daughter loves Eeyore. She more enjoyed the feel of Eeyore's ears and body, rather than play with it. She also enjoyed tasting the rattle rather than shaking it. When mommy showed what Eeyore could do she giggled.Overall I think this particular toy is more for an 18-month child, as opposed to a 12-monther."
5,Excellent Movie,"Jane Doe was excellent. It had action, was clean (no swearing or sex on the show). I would recommend it for all in the family even teenage children. For younger children you may want to watch it once first because of some of the action to see if it is appropriate for them."
5,"an outstanding book, about an outstanding man","An outstanding insight into the life of Cox, which goes far beyond his Watergate notoriety, yet still provides a wealth of info about Watergate, as well."
2,Wrong Book,"If you caught Noah Adams talking about his book recently on NPR, you might think, as I did, that it talks about the early settlers who followed the New River from North Carolina into Virginia and what is now West Virginia (and then onward to Kentucky and Ohio and beyond, as his ancestors did, and mine; we grew up about 10 miles from each other). About their subsistence farming and forestry and mining. It does not. Much of it is about touristy white water rafting and canoeing, which has nothing to do with the people of that region. In the final chapter, in a couple of sentences, he says he ""wondered"" about those early settlers. So did I. That's why I bought the book. I was disappointed."
4,"Charming but slight, like several NPR segments put together","Noah Adams goes on a journey down the New River, stopping to chat with the natives. I love this part of the country and I like Noah Adams, so I was happy to accompany him as a reader. But there is not a lot more content than you would find in several All-Things-Considered segments stitched together...it won't take you much more time to read it than it would to listen to it. The commentary is pleasant but if you want a deep or detailed introduction to the New River Valley of Appalachia you will have to go elsewhere.So set aside a nice Sunday afternoon and have a go at it."
4,a pleasant read,"The review on the back of this book describes it as powerful and passionate. Hardly. It is a pleasant, easy book. If you've got a weekend coming up with not much to do, get yourself a copy of this book to read. The book is not very in-depth or thought-provoking but is an enjoyable way to pass the time. Adams has taken a series of snapshots of life along the New River, featuring historical characters, old-time musicians and young kayakers. What he has achieved is a portrayal of a region that has suffered much from the negative stigma of poverty and backwards hillbillies and made it seem like a very appealing place to live. For that I applaud Mr. Adams. But he does not get into the history, culture and society of a place that many other travel writers are so good at. For that I'm a little disappointed. It is a very nice read though."
2,Major Disappointment,"This book was a surprising disappointment to me. I've enjoyed Noah Adams' work on NPR and expected a work of some substance, wit, and scholarship. Instead, ""Far Appalachia"" is a lightweight and superficial treatment of a subject with considerable human and ecological depth. Over a skimpy 235 pages, in type large enough for the visually challenged, Adams skips down this formidible and fascinating river with no eye for detail and little historical insight. For a ""river"" book of substance, I'd recommend William Least Heat Moon's outstanding ""River Horse,"" or Richard Slotkin's ""Abe,"" an excellent novel about Lincoln's early years and adventurous trips down the Mississippi."
3,Nice Fit - Stupid Belt Clip Feature,"Fits beautifully. Function is great. It's thin, so I can use my plug it radio remote control with it.The screen cover is goofy. It's a raised box-shaped piece of plastic, not a thin film. I didn't use it.The belt clip sucks. It has a plastic button. The case has a bulge on the back to receive the button - this prevents you from laying the iPod down flat on its back. (I removed this with a 3/4"" gasket punch and filled the hole with an adhesive piece of black foam!)The lanyard is silly too. I generally don't use lanyards and would expect the holes to rip through if you tried to use it."
5,Complete Protection,"This case protects every part of my ipod. The only openings it has are for the usb cable, the hold button, and the headphone jack. Everything else is completly covered. It fits the 30GB Video perfectly. The best part about it is that it also protects the screen and the wheel without adding bulk to it. The wheel still functions just as good. It comes with wrist and neck laynard and an optional belt clip."
1,Think Long-term,"When you first put it on, the thing is great, but like every other soft silicon case in existence, it will lead to the inevitable aesthetic destruction of the iPod's shiny casing. The thing is, because it fits so tightly on the iPod, dust that gets in (and dust DOES get in) can never get out, and so everytime you touch it, you're actually just scratching that dust into the face of the iPod over and over again. The result? Well, with my poor U2 edition, it was monsterous. When I decided to take the soft case off for an upgrade to a nicer one, I discovered that the ENTIRE iPod was scratched to the point where it had completely lost it's shiny finish.Never ever ever get a skin-tight soft case for your iPod if you value it's shine and screen readability."
4,"Great Case, But...","This case is great! It protects the whole iPod without scratching it. The wheel protector is awsome. It's touch sensitive and works perfect. It comes with everything you need to protect your iPod; screen protector, optional belt clip, optional neck lanyard, and optional armband. The only problem is that the screen protector keeps shifting around and the cutout is not approximate. I just use plastic film to protect the screen. Other than that, the case is a great one, and it's worth the money."
1,HORRIBLE,"This case is horrible. The screen protector it came with had a huge white spot on it and it obsructed the view of the screen. After you put the iPod through the screen hole you have to put the screen protector into place. The thing slides around and never stays in place. I just got it today and took it off my iPod immediately before it scratched the screen of my beautiful new iPod. J&R is also horrible. It came three days after the last day of the delivery window, three weeks after I ordered it. I will never order from J&R again."
2,Dece,This product is alright. It comes with a screen protector but it never stays in place. The screen protecter actually scratched my iPod more than it protected it. It also doesn't form fit very well to the ipod itself. If your going to spend this much money on a case spend it in a different place.
1,Extreme displeasure,"I have not read this book. I was extremely upset that you did not send me the book I ordered which was ""Not I but Christ"" by Watchman Nee. I am not interested in the book you sent me. I would send it back but it would be hassle and I would probably have to pay a bunch of shipping charges. I cannot believe that you would intentionally send me a book I did not order. Highly disappointed with Amazon.Thank you for giving me an arena in which I can vent my extreme displeasure!!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money on This!!,"I first bought this dvd from Walmart but had to return it because the disc was badly scratched. The plastic that holds the disc in place in the jacket was damaged. Since Walmart was out of stock, I could not reorder from them so I purchased it from Amazon.com. Again, when I received the dvd from Amazon it was badly scratched so I returned it. Amazon sent me another dvd and one of the two discs was also scratched due to damaged plastic inside the dvd jacket. I strongly believe there is a manufacturer packaging problem. Instead of sending back this third copy, my husband attempted to fix the disc using Disk Doctor. Now that I was finally able to view the disc I found that the recording was extremely poor quality. I thought perhaps it was the disk doctor but that was not the case - There are 2 discs in this set and the first disc (one with no scratches) had extremely poor quality recordings also."
4,Real Christmas Music,"Beautiful selection of traditional carols. Only flaw at all is that sound quality sometimes is not quite as clear as it would be with a slightly smaller group. Still, a must have, if you love beautiful music."
5,A Festivall of Carols,"I will be playing this in December, but do remember that I used to have a tape, I am sure it is the same one."
3,like it with reservations,No instructions came with it and I am still unclear how to work the on/off etc. The little tab that sticks up keeps it from moving. Is it supposed to be cut off? An instruction booklet seems important.
4,Hose is great,"You have to store it carefully for it to keep it's shape, but it works great and is very convenient."
4,Plastair Coiled Hose,"Works as advertised. Very flexible compared to earlier, stiffer versions. Flow is somewhat limited, however, due to diameter."
2,convenient for light watering,"There isn't much water pressure, but it isn't much hose. It does recoil, but not in a uniform manner, so I found myself unknotting it in order to use it. They were more trouble then what they were worth, so I replaced them with straight hoses. However, if you had them on your porch to do light watering, I suspect they would be fine."
4,A more convenient hose,"I find this coiled hose so much easier to use than a standard one. They take up less room and are much lighter in weight. I would guess they might not be as durable as a high-quality standard hose, but I could be wrong, since I haven't had one long enough to tell. You do need to buy one longer than you think, because you won't want to totally uncoil it to reach."
1,Don't waste your money!!!,This was very poorly made and leaked horribly from the onset. Very big waste of money. I purchased two and both of them had the same problems. Both were thrown in the garbage. Please don't waste your money on this product.
1,Picture is a much better product than the real thing!,The hose in the picture shows metal conectors the one I got was plastic. I have high water presure and it blew off and soaked my bathroom.
5,Good Quality at a great price,"Not that much can be said about a hose, but this one is fine- good quality construction at the best price I could find. Even better, when my order was lost by the US Postal service (imagine that!) Amazon was truly awesome about shipping a replacement immediately."
2,Cheap Quality,"I previously owned a rubber coil hose for several years which never became kinked. This new coil hose is lightweight as advertised, and as such, it is not very strong. Therefore, it does not recoil very quickly and you have to make it happen somewhat. It tends to twist up each time I recoil it (the plastic kind of sticks) and then I have to take the time to unravel it. Though I am only talking 15 seconds at most, compared to the rubber hose I owned (which I could not find anywhere to purchase) it is annoying. Also, this hose has such a short threaded end that when you twist on a spray nozzle, you may not be able to tighten it enough as you have nothing to grab other than the hose by the time the nozzle gets to the end of the thread. Mine currently drips due to this. I doubt I will even be able to remove the spray nozzle without cutting it off the hose. My advice, find a rubber coil hose then post on Amazon where you found it!"
3,Springhose is not as great as I thought,"I bought the springhose for covienient hose cleanup and for watering my plants. I was a little disappointed in it. When I began to use the hose with my garden nozzle, the water flow was very weak, even with the hose turned to max flow, and the water flow out the nozzle was slow and felt as if it had gaps of air in it. It also often gets caught on corners. It does spring into a small pile, with some of your own effort, and does save time from hose reeling. If you don't mind giving up full pressure in the hose for the spring feature, then it will make you happy."
1,"No Pressure, knocks stuff over","I am an Extension Agent who specializes in Horticulture and I can tell you that this is a poor idea for a product. First, there is insufficient flow though the narrow hose. It takes a long time to properly water with this product. The second major flaw is that once you're more than a few feet from spigot, the hose tends to make a straight line between you and it thereby knocking over pots and breaking fragile stems. The retraction ""feature"" also makes it hard to set a sprinkler out in the yard without staking it down. You would be better served by buying a quality supple hose and spending the 45 seconds (I timed it) to properly wind a hose. This might be okay for someone in a Condo or only has a few plants on a deck."
2,Not what I expected,"Granted, this is a $20 hose, but I thought it would be ok for what I wanted. I only have a small group of shrubs and plants which I wanted to water with this hose and I thought it would be great to pull it out, do my watering, and presto, let it spring back. I was very wrong. First of all, I had a horrible time with the faucet fitting. I tried multiple times to get it to work without leaking but it only ended in me getting drenched when I went to turn the water on or off. The water pressure was not great, but with the smaller hose, I had already assumed that would be the case. If you want to use this for something other than minor watering, don't bother. The spring recoil did not work. I basically had to pick the hose up and place it where I wanted it and ""help"" the recoil process along.I really liked the idea of a quick, cool hose. That's exactly what it was though..just an idea. I would NOT recommend this to anyone."
3,"Readable, but does it add anything new?","The Arthurian canon has been written about over and over, and in some cases by better writers than Paxson. In this series' favor is her knowledge of Saxon culture and religion, which adds a new and different element, and her fairly good use of original texts as her sources. Negative points are her sometimes mundane prose and her occasionally clumsy, Bradley-influenced dialogue. I found it annoying that, as in many other fantasy books, a woman who seeks power for herself (Morgause) is seen as evil and corrupt, whereas a man who seeks power (Artor) is following his ""destiny"". And why is it OK for Guendivar (Guinevere) to sleep with several men but negative when Morgause does it? Overall, this book is an enjoyable read, but the flaws make it hard to recommend it whole-heartedly."
4,Overall good quality music.,"All 3 movements of Bradenburg Concerto #6 lends itself very well to rendition with guitar. Listening to it is a pleasure. Movement #1 of concerto #5 is a disappointment. It is a great piece of music but is not well rendered by guitar. The other concertos fall somewhere in between. Overall, I think that this a very good quality CD and is well worth the purchase."
4,Excellent performance by the Amsterdam Trio,"The whole CD is well performed. However, the 5th concerto suffers from a balance problem. When the harpsicord plays the other instruments dissapear into the background. This would have easily been a five star recording if that was addressed.Any serious Bach or Brandenburg enthusiast, or someone desiring a some good night music/background music should have this album in their collection."
4,"Perhaps not Bergman's best, but still very worth seeing","An outstanding looking, very odd mix of somewhat broad comedy, horrorfilm, and (of course) Bergman's metaphysical musings.A band of traveling magicians, wanted by the law as charlatans, arepulled in for questioning and forced to perform for some upper classnon-believers. The 'nothing-in-life is-what-it- seems' theme is strong,but does get repetitive, and at times you can see it coming.Also, on first viewing the elements didn't really feel like they fittogether, and I found it a bit of a bumpy ride. The comedy made thedark side hard to take seriously, and the serious, creepy elements madethe comedy feel all the more wedged in.That said they are a some amazing sequences that I know will stick withme, and I do feel haunted by the film. Many call it a masterpiece orclose, and I'll certainly see it again."
3,Another fine Ingmar Bergman film,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.The Magician, or Ansiktet (The Face), as it is known in Sweden is a film starring Max von Sydow as a traveling magician who visits a town of skeptics who try to expose his tricks.It isn't as well known as some of Bergman's other films, but has international star Max von Sydow in the lead role. It is slow paced compared to many other films and I really enjoyed watching it.The supplements include a 1990 English language interview with Ingmar Bergman, a 1967 Swedish language interview with Bergman, and a video essay by film scholar Peter Cowie."
2,iheartspongebob,"The used disc was a little more used than I thought. I couldnt watch a few episodes, I had to skip the first two. I love spongebob squarepants and my daughter does also but, it didnt bother her! Great DVD but if you buy it make sure it is NEW!"
4,A great read,Anyone interested in the history of Vikings and Norsemen should read this book.It kept me reading long into the night.The action sequences were well written and it goes without saying that it should be read before veiwing the movie.If you enjoyed 'Eaters of the Dead' by Michael Crichton you will enjoy this.
4,The Great One,"I enjoyed this movie and it captured the time period perfectly. Brad Garrett is in top form as Gleason and you truly get the essence of the man. My one complaint is that this movie really sanitized his life making the portrait incomplete. Gleason was known to be exceptionally generous and also could be unbelievably cruel, neither of which this movie conveyed in full form. But there is no gripe about the acting, which is five stars all the way around. But this film only scratches the surface of the life and complexity of the man who was known and loved as ""The Great One"""
4,True Jackie Gleason Story,"Back in the 1970's, my Uncle Johnny worked as a chauffeur in NYC. One night he was told to pick up Gleason at the 21 Club (21 W 52nd St.). Gleason entered the stretch Caddy, obviously ""well lit"", and barked out the name of his next watering hole. My Uncle thought for a moment and realized that the place was on the same street, about three (3) store fronts away. He backed up the limo, arriving at his destination in about 10 seconds. Without skipping a beat, Gleason unleashed in his inimitable style, ""What kept you!"". He ""greased"" him with a $20.00, opened the door and rolled out."
3,"Brad Garrett is Great, but ""Sanitized"" is correct","The reviewer who said Gleason's life was sanitized was correct. I saw the entire miniseries on TV and it glossed over Gleason's hard drinking and his mean side.Also, iirc, it glossed over Gleason's huge interest in UFOs. Gleason actually had a house built upstate that looked like a UFO. And Gleason swears that he was taken to Area 51 by Ike and saw aliens in a deep freeze.A UFO house wasn't the only unusual thing Gleason built. Gleason was a notoriously heavy drinker - but could still quote Shakespeare when blotto - and hung out at Toots Shor's bar in NYC. When he started broadcasting from Miami Beach, he had the entire Toots Shor's bar dismantled, shipped to FL and rebuilt backstage at his set. He even had Toots Shor himself flown down to mix his drinks.Gleason was quite a guy and Brad Garrett captures him well. But this show WAS definitely sanitized. The Great One would not be amused."
3,How (Semi) Sweet It Is....,"Brad Garrett is pretty good as the Great One. My only beef with this is that it really should have been a mini-series (i.e. HBO's ""John Adams""). Jackie Gleason led a long, interesting life and it would have been nice to see an uncensored biopic that wasn't so condensed."
4,lots of cotton....,"I needed cotton balls for my office and these are perfect for what I need. Look, the price isn't all that low, but the bag is big enough and they should last for some time...not a bad purchase for what you get....a tad-bit small, but not too bad...recommended..."
3,Small,"I use these as part of my facial toning process at night. I use Organic Morracon Rose water (which is amazing both in smell and skin moisturizing), and i have to use 3 of these balls to even start to clog the top when soaking. If i use one, i waste rose water drooling from the sides and the same with two, three seems to work but really?.. Thats why it is 3 stars.Plus they are not like mommas cotton balls, these are more like cotton strands strung together, they hardly keep form, even in bag, untouched. Not balls, strands."
4,Mini Maids holders,I brought these becasue I had a set before and they are just what I needed to wash my mini blinds with. We have 20 windows with mini blinds and they get pretty dirty. We live in a rural area and these holder allows me to place the blinds one at a time in the shower. There I spray them down with Greased Lighting and take a soft brush to them. They are left to dry and then I start on the next one. The suction cup wears out and you can 't find replacements for them. I had to order a new set and it took me a while to find them again.
5,A REMINDER OF THE WAY OPERA USED TO SOUND!,"I'm going to make this very short and to-the-point. They simply don't sing like this anymore ----- sopranos and tenorslike Milanov and Bjoerling are an extinct breed, and we are the poorer for it. Ditto for Fedora Barbieri and Leonard Warren ------- two more outstanding singers ---- all of whom could be heard regularly at the Metropolitan Opera in the 1950's. But then again, so were many other great singers. We don't have voices like this today --- and one hearing of this recording of ""Trovatore"" sadly proves it. Recorded in 1952, it still sounds acceptable --- and no subsequent ""Trovatore"" has matched it, though the famous 1962 broadcast from Salzburg with Leontyne Price, Franco Corelli, Giulietta Simionato, and Ettore Bastianini, all under the baton of Herbert von Karajan, comes the closest."
5,A TROV-LOVER'S DREAM,"What a joy this set is. The singers are all in great voice & fulfill Maestro Cellini's vivid tempi with such gusto that I find myself rather pleased this is in mono with the orchestra necessarily fading into the background. The excellent sound provides one the opportunity to hear Milanov in perfect voice & it is a thrill. Bjoerling, Warren, and a young Barbieri all - using one of Stefan Zucker's favorite phrases - ""give chills'. I seem to be addicted to TROVATORE and this set has reminded me how grateful I am to everyone who rescues & rereleases these treasures."
1,sounds like goggling,"Don't know what all the rage is about. Milanov's voice is too heavy and boring, and Bjoeling sounds like he's goggly with mouth wash, sorry."
1,"So Terrible ""Trovatore""","Among the ""Il Trovatore"" that I had heard, this CD is the worst one. The sound of orchestra is so weak, boring. It's far from powerful sound. The vocal cast was so terrible. The voice of casting doesn't have any tension. So I'd like to say ""Don't buy this CD, even if you like Bjorling or Milanov."" It's very very awful and terrible."
2,So bad it's funny,"If you love ultra-corny, just plain bad kung-fu flicks, this is your movie. I don't know enough about actual kung-fu to say weather or not the kung-fu was good, but the acrobatics were excellent and the diolouge was so funny that I peed my pants like: ""oh we were helpless before them, like little goats.....before a tiger"", or ""You'd better not fight with me, I'm pretty tough stuff!"" I think that there was a total of ten minutes acting and diologe in the movie, and the rest of course was KUNG FU FIGHTING!! And you know what? There was actually some intentional humor thrown in that worked well with the movie. I don't think this movie won any ocsars, but it was funny none the less. Because it was ""so bad, it's funny,"" I wasen't sure if I should give this a very good or very bad rating, so I comprimised and give it a 2.5 stars."
4,A first-hand teacher,"As someone who is fairly new to mouutainering and glacier travel, I found the wonderfully helpfulmin explaining important technequies, that are crucial to any body finding their adventures leading them to the mountains. I found it extermly helpful when I actually set foot on the ice."
5,Don't even think of traveling on glaciers before you read it,Andy is the authority on glacier travel. Walking on a glacier is like walking on the moon. Don't even think of traveling on glaciers before you read it.
4,"Great epic, bad presentation.","Journey to the West is indeed a great epic, and the prose is actually quite good. Its concise and easy to follow. I'm not sure about how accurate the translation is (I can't read Mandarin).However, the one thing that really makes me angry, is the numerous silly spelling errors throughout the book. Its as if no one bothered to edit it (there are one or two errors per chapter). There is even a spelling error in the summary at the back of the book (they used 'isa' instead of 'is a'). The paper and print quality is below average. The book is damaged and creased easily.Although the story is great and the translation is good, the book is presented in a haphazard manner."
3,Readable,This translation is not as flowery as the Anthony Yu translation and does not have the extensive footnotes but is a fun read. Uses more modern language so it's not necessary to constantly look up references to understand the story.
1,chinese classic?,"If this is a classic, then I am Buddha. A complete waste of money. very difficult to read with a revolving theme ( you know whats going to happen a long time before it does! ). I would advise anybody thinking of buying this to browse through it first. The quality of the print is also very bad. Sorry to put down a book so badly, but it is the worst book i have ever bought and everyone I have let it to, returns it within a couple of days. You have been warned."
5,I am your baby now...,"Recently at the Silent theatere in L.A. 30's style singer Janet Klein revived a song from Dixiana ""I am Your Baby Now"". In the film Bebe Daniles sings it, and she sings it after being carried on stage by two giant Ostriches, and she pops out of an egg, so sing it! Great performance. The film is funny and faetures soem great vaudevillians. A cute film with loads of charm, and a nice roamntic comedy. Although I must admid my favorite part of the film is Bebe singing in the egg!!!"
4,Ingredient Book and Cook Book,"Finally I understand why sea salt is so good; and how to choose olive oil. And I now know a few good brands to look for on my gourmet items. This has really helped me shop for excellent ingredients. And the recipes, esp the roasted beet salad, are delicious and simple, relying on the very best ingredients for flavor instead of complicated instructions."
1,Damaged,"I purchased this as a gift and understood it to be a new book. Some pages had a mildew/water stain on them. Unfortunately, since I thought it was new I didn't open it until I was ready to wrap it. It was too late to try for a replacement."
4,"Decent hose for the price, but needed connector....","We purchased this hose to hang outside for shoe/foot rinsing purposes and for that it works great. The problem is that the hose comes with two female ends and in order to attach a spray nozzle or a sprinker you need to buy a connector. For the price, this was a good deal since we combined with something else we needed and received free shipping."
3,Coiled hose,"Bought a 25 ft hose. It's light weight all right, but the coils are stiff and without tugging it hard it is not easy to get much more than 15 feet with it. So it's good only for small areas."
4,Love the color and ease of use,"I have window boxes on my deck and have been frustrated rewinding my old hoses. This is indeed more convenient, I ended up buying two to give the length I needed. It does kink on me a little but maybe that is more due to the long length I have to pull it. But otherwise, looks nice, colorful, no leaks."
2,"Why, Just Why?","I love pretty much anything Susan Elizabeth Phillips writes, so when I picked this book up I pretty expected to be turned into putty overnight. That so did not happen. I know she has a pattern of having the female lead caught in a tough spot with the whole community against her and the guy lead indifferent at best. Unfortunately, in this case it just seemed way to cruel for me. I don't want to give any plot issues away but Adam's treatment of Daisy was just downright demeaning. What makes it worse is that she took it as if that was all she's worth. It was sad, pathetic and every feminist bone in my body was about ready to jump out and beat the two of them."
2,Disappointing,"When I first read Kiss an Angel I was highly disappointed. I don't know why it bugged me so much. Honestly, I just didn't like the hero or the heroine in this book. There is a big difference between an Alpha hero and the abusive protagonist that keeps popping up in romance novels. No amount of love can redeem a jerk who treats women like dirt. Daisy starts out an awesome heroine and turns into a doormat. Susan Elizabeth Phillips is one of my favorite authors and that's the only reason I'm not giving this book a 1-star rating.SEP books I recommend: Natural Born Charmer, It Had To Be You, This Heart Of Mine, Lady Be Good and Call Me Irresistible."
5,Definitely one of my favorites,"This book has it all- Passion, intrigue, love, excitement! SEP is an unbelievable storyteller. Do yourself a favor and BUY THIS NOW."
4,Not her best but good,I have become a SEP fan over the last year. Even though this book has many funny parts I would not describe this book as nearly as funny as many of the other books that SEP has written. I found the end a bit more emotional then others of SEP. Its a good light read with the usual steamy parts.I'm a big Audible.com user and really like the narrator in this book.
5,Leaves you feeling all warm inside!,A friend of mine recommended I read this book. While I had read and enjoyed other books by Phillips I was a little skeptical. I mean a circus? How good can a story set in a circus be? Very very good. This is now one of my favourite books. Alex and Daisy are great together. When you finish reading Kiss An Angel you're left with a warm feeling inside and a smile on your face. Read this book! You won't regret it.
5,A True Treasure!,"After reading the synopsis of this book I was curious as to how this story could be a good romance novel. But it did not take long for me to completely fall in love with these characters and to want a little baby elephant to follow me around. Having read more than my fair share of romance novels and most of Susan Elizabeth Phillips' novels I have to say that this was one of my favorites, you won't be able to put it down, nor will you want to. It is a creative new plot for a romance novel that will totally win your heart! i just cannot say enough good things about this book, if you have not read it i STRONGLY suggest that you do, i dont know how anyone cannot absolutely love it!!!!"
5,Excellent book!,This book has wonderful characters and dialogue. It keeps moving and you won't want to put it down
5,Amazing...,I loved this book! I couldn't put it down even though I had to study for my finals.Alex and Daisy are an amazing couple and the story is so original. I cried and laughed while reading it!
1,"What were you thinking, Phillips?","I wouldn't have given any stars to this despicably-themed disgrace, if it had been an option. It is sad to me that some women actually like a monstrosity that tells women it's okay to be treated as an inferior, dim-witted sex object (and moreover, that the dishonorable and chauvinistic male figure is supposed to be sexy and sought-after). It's no wonder, with trash like this advocating verbal and physical abuse of every kind, that there is such an alarming and disturbing amount of abusive relationships in the world. I cannot respect this book, nor its author, and I pity both the woman who lacks respect for herself to the point that she wants what Daisy has and the one who champions the same."
5,amazing!!,loved it!! light and fluffy at the same time heavy and angsty...enjoyed it very much..great read..my first SEP book..i am looking forward to reading more of her books
3,Broken,"This book was something else. I cried so much and I was emotionally drained after finish reading this book. It was good but it was so terrible at times that I couldn't cheer for a HEA and that sucked. Susan Elizabeth Phillips has this thing for making the hero do something terrible and almost unforgivable which was too much for me this time. You can break something so much that it cannot be fixed and I felt that happened in this book. Also, I had some problem with the characters consistency and could not believe their transformations in the end of the book. In my opinion ""It had to be you"" by SEP is far superior."
5,"Witty, memorable, moving - just great","Phillips took an unlikely premise (modern day arranged marriage), dropped it into a even more unlikely setting (travelling circus), and created a book that is funny, engaging, and completely believable. Her smart wit is evident throughout and she takes care to make her details, such as circus life and historical information, true, but it never gets in the way of her characters. You like them, laugh with them and want to shake them, but you believe in them and want to spend far longer in their company than the page count allows. Very well done, Ms. Phillips, and thank you very much!"
5,Love it!,This was the first book I read by SEP and I love it. I am not much for the whole circus atmosphere but I didn't mind the setting in this book.Daisy's interactions and trials with the animals was wonderful and touching at moments.
5,Loved it!,"I read the Publisher's Weekly review and couldn't believe they were talking about the book I just read. The book was awesome - it took a chapter or so to get into it, but I loved the characters and have no idea what the review meant by an overabundance of sex. (Did they read the right book?) Susan Elizabeth Phillips always knows how to tug on the heart strings of her readers and this book was no different."
1,A waste of time,"This book was all over the place. I usually love SEP and actually read this book because I had just reread Ain't She Sweet for a book club and wanted more of SEP but wish I had known my time would have been better spent reading Ain't She Sweet for a third time. The whole 'sacred' thing was really annoying considering that for the first three chapters all Daisy could think about was jumping ship. What was with the mini-explosions and then nothing more said about it? And then he's descedent of royal family? NO. I didn't buy any of it , when SEP is good she's great but when she's bad she's complete crap-glad I only paid a dollar for the book because that's all it was worth.Do yourself a favor and skip this one."
1,BLEAK AND DISMAL---,"I depend on this author to give me quaint, quirky stories full of laugh-out-loud humor. I could not believe this book. Page after page of cold, self-centered dismay. I kept waiting for the sun to break through the clouds, so-to-speak, but it never happened. The unromantic scene at the end lacked warmth of feeling and was far from anything to cheer about."
4,Loved it!,Great descriptions. Made my imagination fly. Made me laugh and cry. Loved the book and I recommend reading and enjoying it.
3,Good Story,"""Kiss an Angel"" is a fun, easy read. The plot is a bit implausible, but the characterization of the hero and heroine are well done."
4,Started out a little hard to believe but . . . .,"I really didn't think I was going to like it at first. Hard to believe scenarios, mom who steals boyfriend, forced marriage, cigarettes that go up in smoke, circus performers, animals who talk to her. Not my usual taste but I can honestly say that I cried, laughed and felt more with this book than I have with a romance novel in a long time. I also like that fact that while the book was a little racy for me they were married.Good writing & enjoyable characters!"
3,Does melodrama make you cringe?,"I'd read a lot of reviews for Susan Elizabeth Phillips and it's true she is a very good writer. The dialogue is fast and I actually laughed out loud once or twice. However, personally I found that Ms Phillips swings between fast and modern and a rather uncomfortably 'classic' (read unnatural) cliche ridden style. It's not 'bad' writing as such and there are those that are looking for that type of novel, but just as scene starts off believable and zany it quickly plummets to being ridiculous and implausable. Things move too quickly between the main characters and once they get to the circus and tigers with sad looking eyes, melodrama is never far behind. The hero never progresses beyond cardboard cut-out and I'm afraid the sizzling sex scenes were forced and somewhat unsexy.All in all readable, but if 'classic' romance novels make you cringe give this a miss and read Susan Anderson (All shook up) or anything by Jennifer Cruise instead."
2,Carny Romance,This book was like dining on Chinese food. It felt satisfying for a while; it is cute and contains some romantic tension. But right after I finished reading it I didn't care about any of the characters at all. I admit I do not like carnival settings but that wasn't the problem with the book. It just didn't ring true on any level. I have read a few of SEP's books and enjoyed Nobody's Baby But Mine a lot more than this book. I say skip it.
3,Fun....for a car ride or poolside,"I used to read a lot of romances, but not for quite a while. I had just finished a tome regarding history, and was ready for something light. I was passenger in a car when I started this story. Finished it the next day. This book was fun.... but utterly implausable. A modern Barbara Cartland with lightly done fun soft porn thrown in. I could not put it down.... as it was well done in the romantic tension department. On the other hand I was a bit annoyed with myself for reading such a dinky story. If you just have to have a hot blooded hunk fix, tamed by a doll faced ding dong, then this book works. It is silly, fun, shallow... and you might blush if you run across someone you know while you are reading it.SEPhillips has done some much better stories. I remember Fancy Pants from long ago. She certainly has the dialogue and hot baited breath down, but this plot is just .....a circus."
5,One of the best,"I hesitated a long time before I bought this book, only because of some of the reviews. But I really enjoyed it and it is up there with my top favorite SEP books. The setting was hilarious, and the characters funny and heartwarming as always. A light fast read that will make you laugh."
4,Surprisingly entertaining! Wish I'd found SEP earlier!,"I was in the local bookstore looking for a good book to curl up with for the weekend when, to my extreme dismay, the latest release from one of my favorite authors of contemporary romance was sold out. Actually I suppose this was a fortunate incident, otherwise I might not have been compelled to pick up a work of SEP. I had seen some friends reading her work last year, but I'm always reluctant to try new authors (being a college student forces me to be a bit cheap/thrifty!). I'm sooo glad I took a chance though; SEP really won my heart with her ability to make a reader feel the hero and heroine's every emotion. Her writing embodies the spiritual roller coaster that is meant to be in contemporary romance!"
2,Not the best I've ever read,"Un like a lot of people who loved this book, I really didn't not find this one up to the par of Honey Moon or Nobody's Baby but Mine or Dream A Little Dream. It's very unconventional and it does have some moments where you laugh out loud but all in all not a book I would tell someone looking for a SEP to read."
3,Good,"I did like this book, but the hero was a little too mean and abusive. He seemed to be this way most of the book, and fails to trust the heroine time and again. But having said that I did like the book, the hero does redeem himself in the end, but I would have like to see more of his good quality throughout the book a little more. The heroine is just sweet, loving and just wonderfull if not a little pampered in the begining but she gets over that real quick. So I did enjoy book and the circus backgroung was really interesting."
5,This ring is awesome.,"For $8, you can't get a prettier ring. I wear mine all the time. It's not perfect, but seriously, if you're looking for perfection with $8. . .I don't know what to tell you. I'm seriously considering buying the other shapes of solitaire rings that Gem Avenue has for sale. Awesome!!"
2,Misleading picture,"I usually love rings from this company but be warned that this ring doesn't look anything like the picture. The ring I received had a super long rectangular stone, not a nice square as seen in the picture. Mine was also tarnished or looked like it had torch marks up the side. I will definitely be returning this ring."
2,dammaged goods,"the first time i got this ring which was last year i got one that was really good, but when i ordered this one this year (2009) I got it bent and it looked like the diamond was lop sided with the ring, i guess that's what you get for a cheap ring under $10Not buying from Gem Avenue again."
2,not good enough,"When I received this ring, I was not happy because its box looks very cheap. I was not stunned by the ring, it looks simple. But it doesn't really look fake at first glance. The stone though got loose. And the polishing is not good!"
2,WARNING! YOU CAN NOT PUT THESE IN THE DISHWASHER!,"Otherwise, they're lovely, very sturdy and big. Little heavy, but very pretty. The dishwasher issue was a non-starter for me. I returned them."
4,babysitter book,"Very informative. it's a great book for babysitters, for newbies and oldies to the job. good book."
4,Great Film but a Bit Short,The film was quite entertaining and well done. I only complain that the film was a bit short and at $30 bucks I kind of feel slighted.
2,For short people only,"If you and everyone you know are four feet tall, this tripod might work very well for you. For the rest of us, it's going to be way too short. But even beyond that,it is not so easy to extend the legs or to stabilize it....not such a friendly tripod all around."
2,Flawed Recording for a Good Cause,"This recording probably falls into the category of albums that are not likely to be worn out from over-listening. Recorded live, this benefit concert boasts an impressive roster including Donna Murphy, Randy Graff, the Callaway sisters, and many other popular theater performers. Unfortunately, much of the material wasn't worth recording. If that weren't bad enough, the sound quality is poor and the accompanying piano is insufficient in creating the necessary mood for each piece. Worst among the performances is Rachel York who wonders ""Will It Matter that I Was?"" Both the song and the singer leave much to be desired. Alix Corey's ""I Know You're There"" is the only stand out number from this benefit. There is genuine emotion in her signing, and the lyrics, though spotty at time as in ""You needn't panic/I'm not consulting and gurus/Calling psychics, practicing with voodoo"" are generally effective."
4,great album for a great cause,"I love this album but there are a few songs that I enjoy more on other albums. I think Lilias White's ""How Can You Be Gone"" is a classic song for the person left behind when a loved one dies. Rachel York's song is quite good as well. I thought Eddie Korbich's song was a great break from some of the heavier songs and Nancy Lamott's ""We Live on Borrowed Time"" gains poignancy when one remembers her untimely death. Get this album...it is one you can revisit over and over."
4,Almost perfect,"Have had this for several years and it mostly works very well. With my smaller cameras ( N90, F80, FM3, D80 ) and lenses up to 300mm, it would be hard to ask for more than what this head provides.The problem occurs when I mount my F4 or D700 and turn it sideways for a portrait format shot. The mechanism just doesn't have enough ""grab"" to hold the camera without ""slipage."" This can be demonstrated by holding the head and, with your hand, trying to ""make it slip."" It isn't hard to do. Once locked, it should be rock-solid in that position like a head with a knob is. My Slik head simply isn't.With probably most camera-lens combos, it will work like a charm. If you have heavy, ""Pro"" gear, test it before you buy it."
5,A great pistol grip head,"I used my old Slik pistol grip head for over 15 years -- until I just wore it out. I like it so much that I just purchased a new one. It's great to feel the ""solidness"" of this new one. This is one case in which ""the new"" was made just as good as ""the old""! I highly recommend it!"
4,Punk rock with a heavy dose of Southern rock.,"Hellstomper is one of those bands that I wish was still around, but in reality they probably hung it up at the right time. They were offensive, humorous, and played rock 'n roll like it was meant to be played: Loud, fast, and care-free. This album is a gem and a must-have for fans of Flat Tires, ANTiSEEN, Hammerlock, and just rock 'n roll in general."
5,happy memories,I grew up with this sound filling the house at Christmas time. It fills my heart with joy!
5,A classic performance,"""Alfie"" is a near perfect film anchored by an incredible performance by Michael Caine. Insightful, unpredictable, and very human this is a film that gets better with every viewing."
3,Michael Caine looks great! But it's a meaner portrayal of Afie. I prefer Jude Law's version :(,"The movie is very well acted, and Michael Caine is at his most beautiful! But it's a meaner portrayal of the main character. Jude Law's version is more humane."
2,Good not one of his best but good,Not a great moive but it was good this is not one of his best movies but it was ok to watch
5,"What's it all about, Alfie?","Michael Caine plays the title character, a rogue who spends his life having affairs with various women and making them (and himself) miserable. One woman (Julia Foster) he impregnates, but refuses to marry, and as he goes to other, more selfish women, he bemoans his ""ties"" to Foster as he sinks into the depths with the others. By the end he's a fairly detestable character, despite his feeling of remorse, Caine acts the part excellently, as does Shelley Winters who plays a rich, man-using lush. There is also a great jazz score written and played by Sonny Rollins. Definitely worth a watch (and listen)."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Dated, slow, and not especially interesting, Alfie is only of interest as an artifact documenting the beginning of swinging London and as a fine showcase of Michael Caine's talent; if neither of those things (or bar brawls) interest you then look elsewhere."
5,Everybody Luvved Them Brits...,"...I mean, of course, those mop-topped ones like the Beatles, Gerry and the Pacemakers, the Dave Clark Five and any of those British Invasion rock groups. Sean Connery's Bond--James Bond. These cats could do no wrong, until, of course, the Who and this moovy--& later on a ""Clockwork Orange""--blew the lid off forever.Michael Caine plays the cockney everyone loves to hate in this rather sad story. Someone said that Caine came full circle in his recent Oscar winning performance of Dr. Wilber Larch in ""The Cider House Rules""....I would say Caine redeemed Alfie as Wilber Larch. Is Alfie a sociopath who is so narcissistic that he sees the women he runs through as ""here to somehow please him and his needs only""---or is he just the Typical Male done to a 60's Mercy Beat? Shirley Winters plays in a role that I'm guessing she took relish in. Compare with the Beatles moovy ""A Hard Days Night"" and the Dustin Hoffman moovy ""The Graduate""..."
1,Horrible,"How people like this movie is beyond me. Alfie is a complete jerk (and that's being nice). I watched this movie with my mouth hitting the floor a couple of times. Alfie was a complete dog and was just down right mean to women...and they put up with it. Was this truly a reflection of the times? Lord, I hope not. I understand this movie was up or won a quite a few awards and all I can say was that it must not have been too much competition that year. Skip this movie if you can."
2,Boring..................,"I have seen this film about 3 times and each time I find the same feeling, one of boredom. It's too long for one thing for such a thin plot. On the good side, Caine is good, the look and feel of the swingin' London '60's is good from a sociological point of view and Vivien Merchant is wonderful in a supporting role as a mature woman who is impregnated with Alfie's baby and has an abortion, which no doubt was daring for the 60's. Suffice it to say that the movie hasn't weathered well in the 38 years since its release, but it's an interesting watchpiece of the '60's, if you can stay awake during the long stretches of boredom."
4,This is really CUTE!,Unico is a great character! This and the other one should be re-released! And I mean SOON!
5,I need to buy this movie,"I saw this movie when I was younger and would like to buy it, you should to. If anyone knows how I where I can get a copy please write me at Lilacs_1@hotmail.com I would very much appreciate it. Watch it if you can you don't know what you are missing out on!!!!"
1,Check your faucets first for compatibility!!!!,"I was not able to connect the coiled water hose to any of my faucets. I recently upgraded the faucets in both the kitchen and the bathroom and the hose connector did not fit either one. The kitchen faucet has a wand which detaches from the main hardware and I even went so far as to dismantle the wand but the Plastair SpringJet Water Hose still was incompatible.Plastair SpringJet 50-Foot Coiled Water Hose and Wand Set, Ocean Blue #PUJ250B93OT"
3,"quality good, connection not so","The hose is good quality, made in Canada, but if your kitchen sink has a combo faucet/spray, the garden hose threads match, rather than are smaller or larger than your sink threads, resulting in not having an adapter that works - in short, I'm unable to use this product."
1,The Comments Are Right,Most all said it was trash... they are right.It does come with a metal adaptor/connector between the plasticand the sink (this is new I think). However it still leaks bigtime.It is being returned unused.
1,Very Disappointed,"I was excited about this product. It seemed like it would allow me to easily water my plants around my room. When I tried to hook it to my sink, the connections did not attach easily. It leaked and when the water was turned up with any pressure at all, it popped off of the sink - In order to keep the hose attached, the water pressure has to be very low. It took longer to water with this hose than to carry water to the plants in one gallon water jugs.Plastair SpringJet 50-Foot Coiled Water Hose and Wand Set, Ocean Blue #PUJ250B93OT"
1,BAD DECISION,"This was one of the worst items I have ever bought on the web. There is no way to keep it fastened to the faucet. When you tighten it to the faucet and turn the water on, the plastic disk attached to the hose blows out the bottom of the ring around the outside faucet and you have no way to keep the hose connected to the faucet. Not worth having."
1,RIP OFF,I wasted my money on this. It was made of plastic parts and squirted water all over my kitchen as it came apart in several pieces the first time I used it. It has gone to the dumpster - WAS MY BAD PURCHASE of the week.
5,Perfect for any place without a real faucet,"My only trouble with this item is that I had to go track down an adapter to make it fit my sink. Other than that, it's been perfect: we can water all of our patio and indoor plants with very little trouble. It works MUCH better than hauling 8-10 pails of water outside every few days! Surprisingly enough, the water pressure is pretty high, too."
1,broke with first use,The first time I connected it and turned on my faucet the water pressure blew the plunger apart making it inoperable.Do not waste your money on the cheap plastic construction.
5,Cuts down watering time dramatically!,"I love this tool for easy plant watering. It's lightweight and the 50' length can reach all of my potted plants on the main floor of my house, the front porch, and back deck without changing faucets. No more filling pitchers over and over and walking back and forth dripping on the floor. As is typical, it leaks slightly at the faucet attachment, but that drains into the sink so there is no mess. Also, the plastic coupler is sometimes difficult to unscrew from the faucet when finished."
1,plastair springjet,this item used to be 50.00 now reduced . It still isnt worth the lower price . Very poorly made. The connecting attachment is to soft and strips as soon as you try to tighten it up .
1,a few drops at a time,"At best, it takes a longggggg time to water a plant (water barely dribble out of the tiny pin hole ;-)"
2,Don't unhook it,I like it but the part where the hose hooks onto the sink is made of plastic so everytime you take it off it strips the inside. The end result is water shooting out of the top part. I ended up going out and buying another one with a metal connector.
1,very un-usable product,"Sorry if you're intested in a device to accomplish the stated function, keep looking...as this is junk...I received the item 3 days ago..and haven't been successful in using it...the idea is good...but even with low water pressure on my faucet...as soon as I get it attached and turn on the water -- even slowly -- the apparatus pops apart and you have water all over your kitchen...the screw on fitting remains on the faucet... the flaw is in the design - the part that attaches to the screw-on collar has very little variance - and either that bit of pressure pops it off-...or --- where the two elements attach don't allow for ANY moverment..I really tried everything --- and it was very disappointing...I will be returning it tomorrow and look for a higher quality design"
1,"Plastair SpringJet 50-Foot Coiled Water Hose and Wand Set, Ocean Blue #PUJ250B93OT","We purchased this in January 2007, and had to replace the hose connector right after we received it to keep it from leaking, used it only a few times and always kept it stored in a protected area in the shade. We tried to use it today (11-30-08) and the hose had split. We are very disappointed in the quality of this item and if I could give it minus stars, I would. Plastair SpringJet 50-Foot Coiled Water Hose and Wand Set, Ocean Blue #PUJ250B93OT"
4,Love it!,I live in a 2nd floor apartment with no outside access to water. Watering my container garden took forever with multiple trips from faucet to plant. It attaches easily to my kitchen sink and the 50 foot length is perfect for reaching all plants outside. I love it!
1,dockman,I have a problem with it leaking where the hose screws onto the faucet. I thought i would have been better made for the $25 i paid for it.
1,Next!,"The item does not fit all standard faucets, and it does not stand up to any pressure other than a dribble. I ended up going to a local hardware store, buying an adapter and fitted it with a small garden hose. Cheaper and does the job much better. The item is very attractive."
2,Not Exactly as Advertised - Unsatisfactory,"Plastair SpringJet 50-Foot Coiled Water Hose and Wand Set, Ocean Blue #PUJ250B93OTThe picture clearly shows brass or metal faucet connectors on the product, but what I received has not just plastic, but cheap plastic connectors. The plastic connector flexes when tighened on the faucet and leaks immensely. When tighened more, it leaks more because it flexes and separates from the internal hose component. Even if you can tolerate the leaking, if you tug any at all on the hose it will pull through the cheap plastic connector on the faucet separating it from the connector and the faucet. Unless one is interested in wasting huge amounts of water, I cannot recommend this product to anyone as it is totally unusable."
1,Bad product,In the picture it show's metal conectors they are really plastic. I hooked it to the bathroom sink and it blew apart soaking the entire bathroom. Not a happy customer !
1,i'd love to try it,i'm sure this is the answer to my constant quest to move water without carrying buckets around. i ordered this product in june but i'm still waiting for the shipment to arrive and the summer is rapidly waning. c'mon amazon send me my hose.
1,METAL OR PLASTIC??,"WHAT GOES? IN PICTURE IT SHOWES METALL COUPLER, I RECEIVED ONE WITH PLASTIC COUPLER. WOULD NOT STAY ON WHEN WATER PRESSER WAS TURNED ON. I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH AMAZON FOR A LONG TIME. NOW I FEEL LIKE I HAVE BEEN RIPPED OFF. SENT IT BACK FOE A REFUND! WE WILL SEE! WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK!"
1,Waste of money,"I would have been better off with a watering can! This is pretty much junk with a plastic coupler that wouldn't seal on my faucet. Water was squirting out the side of the connection and therefore, I had zero water pressure at the other end. I maybe was able to use this once or twice and then decided it wasn't worth the hassle. Waste of money."
2,Unnecessary,"After just a couple of weeks, this is already busted and in the trash. The part that screws onto the sink is plastic and can not handle the water pressure. If you have two people and one person can turn the water off and on so there is never any pressure built up, it would probably work just fine. But we found that, if this will screw onto your sink faucet, any hose will and we just brought in our outdoor garden hose with metal fittings and it works great. I wish we had tried that first before we bought this."
1,Not the best product,This product is already broken - only used twice. Attachment to spigot would not hold - hose became detached.Would not recommend.
2,low water flow,"low water flow, cord gets tangled if pulled much and seems to strain the plastic fixture...all plastic!! :("
3,Ocean Blue,At first it appeared to be the same as a spray hose we bought years ago.The sprayer was not as well made and the hose fittings were made of plastic. So inorder to get a working sprayer hose (which my wife uses from her wheelchair to water plants on our deck) I took the best pieces from the broken one and pieces from the new one to make one usable product. This just show that you don't always know what the quality of a product you buy sight unseen over the internet.
1,"Angel, houseplant hobbiest",I am very dissappointed with this tool. This is the second one that I have ordered and both leak water out of the side of the nozzle. This makes it impossible to use it inside of the house. That is the reason I ordered it to begin with.
1,Plastair SpringJet Hose and Wand Set,"I was very disappointed with this product. Hooked it up to sink and it leaked at connection. Took it apart and fixed that problem only to have it leak at the spray nozzle. Took it off, couldn't fix that so I have no spray nozzle on the end, which shortened my reach by 12"". Would not suggest anyone buy this one."
1,"Poorly made, cheap materials",The hose pulled free from the female faucet side connector. It leaked even before it broke. Total waste of money and time.
2,Doing the job for now but cheaply made,"I got this to be able to quickly water plants and top off our hot tub and it is doing the job for now. It is soooooo cheaply made that I am pretty sure it will not last long. The plastic parts have all kinds of flashing left on them, the open/close latch doesn't work because the parts don't fit well, it leaks."
1,Water Hose and Wand,"The product was delivered in a timely mannor. That is the good point. After connecting the hose to the water supply and turning the water on, the coupling blew apart. So I put it all togeather and reconnected it. I tried a much lower water pressure with the same results. After repeating this procedure a few more times,with the same results, I went to Lowe's and bought a 3/4"" to 1/4"" reducer, cut the connector off the hose and put on the reducer. Now it stays connected to the water supply and is useable. However, the nozzle will not adjust, I can only get a solid stream, no spray or anything else. Would I recommend this item, I don't think so."
1,Plant Watering Hose,"I was very excited to get this product, because I live in a condo and have plants and flowers on my terrace, but no outdoor faucet. I could just hook it up to my kitchen sink and the long hose esily reached outside to the terrace. Unfortunately, the first time I used it, it came apart and water sprayed all over my kitchen! I was very disappointed with this product."
1,Does not work!,"Despite many negative reviews on this product, I went ahead and bought it hoping the product would work but it did not. The hose is the perfect size that I was looking for because I have a balcony garden and I have to carry pitcher after pitcher outside. The fixtures are metal but it would keep popping off my faucet. Even if it did fit securely, the hose has an inherent defect because the water literally enters the hose one drip at a time because the metal fixture is attached to the pipe with a plastic part that has a tiny little hole. I am back to the pitchers of water again!"
2,Not for large plants or distance of more than 20',"This item doesn't stretch 60'...it is more like 25-30'. Any farther than that and the plastic female connector on the hose itself leaks and sprays water in about a 3' radius. The problem is that they provide a male metal connector for the faucet and plastic connector on the hose. Also, if you have any large plants, the water flow is so small that it takes forever to water. I have 5 Hibiscus that range from 3'- 7'and one Lemon Tree that is over 10' and all of them are more than 30' from the nearest sink. I still have to water them by hand or risk creating a geyser in my kitchen. If you have small-medium plants within 25' of your water source this is a great item."
1,Bad Design Too much trouble to return,Plastair SpringJet PUJ250B93OT-AMZ 50-Foot 3/8-Inch Coil Garden Hose Wand Set - BlueWasher not includedPoor design where product attaches to house hose spigot. Inner part that is attached to 1/8 inch hose slips through end of part or again the part that attaches to house spigot.I had original item like this for 12 years made by predessor of this manufacturing company and loved it.To much trouble to send part back to you. Really hurt my impression of Amazon and quality products.Ed Parmacek
2,3/8 inch x 50 Foot Coil Garden Hose,I am not sure I got what I paid for. My hose is 1/4 inch x 50 Feet.Because of the smaller size of the hose the volume of water is reduced greatly. It is usable but takes more time to water my plants.
2,Cheaply made...,"The description of the product and the price compared to other indoor hoses made me think this was going to be a nicely constructed product. It is not. It works, but as others have reported it leaks at the faucet. Additionally, the sprayer does not change from a stream, the description says it will go from a fine mist to a stream. Be aware it does no such thing. Additionally the plastic the entire product is made from is cheap and feels like it will wear out before long. Time will tell."
4,Indoor watering hose,"Works well, only problem I have is draining it for storage. All in all, though, better than old hose that kinked when you went around corners and was a pain in the butt to wind up each use so it wouldn't be a tangled mess next time."
2,don't bother,"The hose did not get tangled which was good however, the connection at the kitchen sink did not last for more than 2 minutes then it started leaking and disconnecting completely. I was dissappointed."
1,GARBAGE,This Item is one of the biggest piece of junk i have ever bought. The hose is very very thin and not sturdy and the faucet coupler is IMPOSSABLE to connect. and it pops off constinently. even if it did connect and stay as it's supposed to the itewm wouldn''t last 2 weeks due to it's flimsy and cheap construction. The manufacturer and AMAZon ahould be ashamed they sold this item.
1,haterz,"there aint but one screw and he from that southside of the then ""htown"" this some wanna be screw, nuttin but a plexer knowwhatim talking bout.dem real screw tapes you cant even buy in no stores xcept for da screw house---so quit hatin maaan its goin down!"
2,was expecting more,"i thought this would be more like the ""don't know much about geography"" book which i love. and the series is good. good information inside i'm sure, but it's practically a baby book."
4,a fishkeepers guide to Central American Cichlids,"Some damage to binding, could have been done by the U.S. mail. Information is very good. Arrived on time."
3,Guide to the Birds of Alaska,This is a comprehensive guide to the birds that inhabit Alaska. I would like to see range and distibution maps of the birds and more than one or two pictures of a particular species.
3,Guide to the Birds of Alaska,"This guide help me to eliminate some of the birds that are not in Alaska. The pictures are not real clear, so it was difficult to use for identifying purposes. The script did suggest possible other bird that are similar, and was helpful it that way."
4,Typical,"This appears to be a very good, typical guide book of birds with pictures and details to help you identify birds as you see them. We will be looking forward to checking off all of the birds that we see when we make the trip to Alaska!"
5,Birds of Alaska,"This is a great book for the beginner or expert. I used it in Alaska for two weeks while on vacation and it was invaluable as many of the birds were new. What I especially liked was the how the book broke the state into sections then listed the species as common, uncommon, or rare for each season of the year in each section of the state. This quickly narrowed the possible choices. There is also at least two pictures of each bird. A good choice if visiting Alaska."
1,Cheap Price = Cheap Product,"You would think that with an item that required assembly, the manufacturer would at least make sure it can be assembled. The simple effort of screwing on 4 legs to a fireplace grate cannot be done if the leg screw holes are grossly oversized and NOT THREADED. On a lighter note, one of the legs had the proper size screw hole and was threaded.To sum things up, I still really need a fireplace grate. I hope Ace Hardware Outlet items can be returned directly to the store.Thanks and remember, Buyer Beware."
5,"18"" Flexible Orbit Tubing","This is an excellent sprinkler head tubing if you need to connect the underground threaded PVC pipe to your sprinkler head, and the measurements are angled and slightly off, or if the connector is in this spot, but you need to put the head in that spot a few inches out of the way. It's also useful if the head is very long, and you need to use the head's side connector. It prevents you from having to dig too much.This flexible tubing has spinnable ends, making it a cinch to connect while the head is in the ground. One thing to look out for is make sure the tube you get is indeed the 18 inch one, as I found that the smaller ones have a tendency to kink too much, preventing the pop-ups from functioning properly. If you prevent kinking, it works great. I am currently using 4 of them with great results."
3,Adorable but not durable,"My daughter loved this guitar for her 5th birthday; I hate to give it only 3 stars. However within days the strings were falling off and the wood piece under the strings fell off. She treated it pretty well so I don't think this was from mishandling. For the price, I hadn't expected it to last forever(I wanted to see if she was really interested before investing it something more expensive), but I was disappointed it wasn't more durable for a beginners guitar."
2,"Looks, great but you get what you pay for","This was a great ""wow"" gift under the tree but for actual physical play it's life span is nill. Within the week after recieving it my eight year old daughter came to me with parts of the guitar that had fallen out. I have no idea what the guitar parts are called but it's the wood thingy that goes under the strings near the bottom. after I put that back I treid to re tume the strings only to find out that one of the string keys had no resistance, it just fell back leaving that string lax and off tune. *sigh* needless to say I would NOT purchase this agian and I suggest you consider a better built product as even though the price is great the longevity stinks."
1,Piece of junk,It's cheap - which is what you expect - but it arrived broken - I should have sent it back but didn't have time and let my daughter play with it so she wouldn't be dissapointed. I had a plastic guitar when I was about 5 (about 30 years ago) that was much better quality than this and probably cost about [...] bucks.
2,broke,"would have been a great beginners guitar for my little man but the strings were broken when it got to us. I was able to fix it with glue but another part broke within a day. Very fragile toy! My child wasn't rocking out or anything rough with it, simply strumming the strings. Not happy with the product."
2,Not the best...,"I used to sell Mary Kay and some people love this stuff, swear by it, and well, honestly, I can't see what the fuss is all about. I only ordered it sparingly because I just couldn't recommend someone buy something that I thought was overpriced and didn't work well. I think it is WAY overpriced for the small 3 ounce size, and the smell, yuck! Kinda like an antiseptic. It does a fair job of moisturizing, sorta like using Vaseline lotion. You'll be reapplying it time and time again if you have very dry skin like mine. For my buck and very sensitive skin, you can't beat Gold Bond's hand lotion. It last forever and heals your hands almost overnight. This stuff, well again, get more for your money and something that works and grab the Gold Bond instead. At least you won't stink the rest of the day and your hands will feel much, much better!"
1,the peach scent is so awful!,"The product description never seems to mention that this hand cream would have what supposedly is a peach scent. I took the plastic wrapper off before I knew about the scent, or should I say odor, so I cannot return this item since it is considered ""opened."" I tried to give it to several friends who all said no thank you. The smell is so unpleasant that I have thrown it all away. Do not buy this scented product!"
4,The best of tintin,"I saw this movie when I was 7-8 years old and was thrilled to find it at amazon. It is the best movie with Tintin, and for me it keeps the charm it had when i first saw it. Great movie, good play from the actors. I strongly recommend it for boys under 10 of age."
1,Item returned,"I had bought a copy of this film from Australia (Region 4) which had English sub-titles. I wanted to send a copy to my family in the USA, so thought to get Region 1 version from Amazon US. Malheusement, this version was wholly in French with no sub-titles. It could have been made more apparent in the description that there were no sub-titles.I had bought a copy of Tintin and the Blue Oranges at the same, but this had been opened (which was how my family discovered that there were no sub-titles) and so I was unable to return the item. (Again, the Australian version does have English sub-titles)With a foreign language product, it would have not been difficult to state whether sub-titles were available, more clearly."
2,"Better than FORTY DAYS, but","After reading FORTY DAYS, I would not have bought or read FIFTY DAYS but since I already had it, I did read it. It is somewhat better than FORTY DAYS, but is still full of useless, pointless pages that do not relate or contribute to the story. The book is 603 pages long. Of the first 200 pages, perhaps 25 contribute to the story. Not all of the other pages contribute either. The book has much scientific information added that does not relate and many of the authors political comments that don't belong. Reading FORTY and FIFTY was a waste of time. There is no way I will read SIXTY DAYS AND COUNTING. Don't waste your time either. There are a lot of better books ot there."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"A good followup about the politics of rapid climate change. It certainly would have been interesting to see the difference between what would have happened in Washington D.C. had had the you know what kicked out of it, rather than New Orleans, for example, in real life.A little bit about betting market modelling of key players and individuals as a surveillance tool is also thrown in.Then there is whacky Frank, living in his tree house, dodging spooks, apart from his girlfriend, who he is actively undodging and connecting with, so to speak."
1,Disappointing,"The book was not engaging .... I had to force myself to finish it, hoping it would redeem itself. More description of looming severe weather events and their effects would have made it a more interesting read. Also the political views are so unrealistic that they border on the unbelievable, and detract from the work."
1,Not really Sci-Fi,"This is actually more science fact then science fiction. There is way too much technical information and not enough story. It reads more like a textbook then a sci-fi novel. If your looking for an action book, this is not it."
2,Definitely not Robinsons best,I have read all of KSR's previous books and have always been able to get past some of his more meandering passages. Not this time! He really lost me in the first half of the book somewhere in the park. Irrelevant subplots and characters were very distracting. I also found the science to be much more superficially presented in this book than in his others. This book needed more focus on the main plot and on the science. I will not be reading the next installment.
2,Not Awaiting the Third,"I picked up ""Forty Signs of Rain"" just before Christmas and couldn't put it down. A number of characters were developed and a suspenseful storyline ensued. I finshed the book quickly and ran out to get ""Fifty Degrees Below"". What a disappointment! The only story is about Frank living in the wilderness getting back to paleolithic life. This goes on ad nauseum. How many times do we need to read about him getting in and out of his treehouse or playing frisbee golf or searching for aurochs? Meanwhile the other characters from the previous book are nearly forgotten including Charlie, Joe, Anna and Dreprung. The environmental changes don't appear until half the book is over. The only good thing about ""Fifty Degrees Below"" is that I won't be sitting around anticipating the release of the third."
1,Poorly written waste of time,"Is is amusing how many people are giving this more than one star simply because of its trendy subject. Global warming aside, this is quite possibly the most poorly written, contrived and boring novel ever committed. Stupid plot, unbelieveable characters and actions. Living like a forest primate? I couldn't take any more after the ridiculous frisbee runner sequence. Idiotic."
5,"Whats with you ""just lisa""","Sasha is the most adorable thing in the whole world!I say get her get her!!!!!!!!!!!!! and ""just lisa"" how could you say dont make her hair that way!"
2,too inappropriate and skimpy!!,"I do not like this doll. Her clothing is too skimpy. MGA should not be marketing a doll in inappropriate clothing to anyone. Surely parents who don't want inappropriate dolls can pass on a doll like this and get a doll that's APPROPRIATE for their children, not skimpy like this one!!"
2,A BRA MATTEL?,"First,lets take a look at her clothes.Look at the pjs,the top looks like a bra,but the pants are okay.Now, her body. This doll has breasts and a teeny tiny little waist.And they say Barbie promots eating disorders.I also hate the the name of this product.Nitey -Nite?The name sounds like an adult perfume!! Overall though, I like this doll."
1,huh a alien,Sasha is her verry ugly she looks like a alien okey she is verrry black but that's not a problem but don't make her hare too waving and black and do something with her make up
3,girl,The weave needs to stop! Stop because you are black MGA needs to stop making your hair too it is going past her feet nobody has hair like that make you look ugly and Sasha is not she is a very preety doll but MGA needs to slow it down her hair is to long for her.
5,Pretty!,This doll is SOOO pretty. Yasmin and Jade are pretty too. Fianna and Cloe need a SERIOUS make over.
3,Good in parts,"This CD is let down by a truly terrible rendition of the G Minor Ballade, which crashes and groans to a ludicrously over-stated climax. There are many better recordings of this timeless masterpiece available. (Particularly impressive from the pre-stereo era is a 1953 recording by Claudio Arrau.) The rest of the CD, however, is saved by a magical performance of the F Minor Ballade (one of the best I've heard) and some lovely etudes and waltzes. In short, it's a mixed bag - good in places, but don't buy it for the 1st Ballade."
4,"Not perfect, but it's all there is.","""Lenny Bruce Without Tears"" shows us the late ""sick comic"" at his best, as well as at his worst.Kinescopes from ""The Steve Allen Show"" and an unaired TV project show Lenny as sharp and energetic. News footage shows him during (and after) his slow death from drugs, and what one observer called ""an overdose of police.""There is some padding. Stock footage accompanies routines from Lenny's LPs. Too many people who barely knew Lenny give us their opinions on him (Fans of ""A Christmas Story"" will cringe as Jean Shepherd suggests Bruce's popularity may lead to a new totalitarianism, in which the un-hip are sent to gas ovens[!]).However, the filmmakers did the best they could with what they had, and none of the footage they used happens to be currently available elsewhere. This alone makes ""Lenny Bruce Without Tears"" a must-see."
5,Buy this to learn about Lenny Bruce,"If you want to learn about Lenny Bruce, buy this video. You will see him at his best but also at his rambling worse after his arrests. This is a study of his life so if you are viewing this just for comedy, you may be disappointed. Most of the jokes don't translate well for 40 years. But as a study in this cult hero, this is a ""must buy""."
4,Gets Heated but a slim and elegant laptop,"Every thing is great about this laptop except the heating problem. It gets heated from the front right side. I dont know why is it so. My friend has this one and that gets heated too. Otherwise, this is a marvellous state of art and fashionable Laptop."
4,Reliable system,Good and reliable altghough slow at times due to the processor speed. Using it for over 5 years now. It has been used heavealy (approx 10 /hrs a day). upgraded memory to 1 GB and hard drive to 320G to keep up wiht teh demand.
5,"Alas, a truly new voice in poetry.","Finally a new work of poetry that reflects a deeper introspection! If you enjoy how one's most centered inner spaces reflect all things exterior, you will enjoy this compilation of reflective insights. The author is a scientist and this may explain the uniqueness of the work. His voice is original in that his expressions and metaphors reveal and weave the abstract realms of love and emotion with the calculated observations of lucid reasoning and logic. You get the quantum and chaos of the human condition with this poet. One can't but feel his sharp observations and fierce passions on everything from classical philosophy, religion, to his very own personal relationships. Truly a refreshing work from clearly a genuine explorer of the human soul!"
5,"Incredible Schumann performance ... Pure Gold ... Thanks,Horowitz!","This is my favorite Schumann piano CD. Horowitz is the ""primus inter pares"" pianist of the 20th century. The Piano Sonata op 14 by Horowitz is for me the most beatiful interpretation ever. A sublime performance where is joined Schumann and Horowitz ""per secula seculorum"". The Humoreske and Phantasiestucke op 111 are pure ""gold"" in this CD. Please ... Buy without fear! It's a pity that Sony don't offer all Schumann/Horowitz records in a double CD, with Fantasia op 17, Kreisleriana and Kinderszenen ..."
1,navel gazing galore,"i really wanted to like this record, not because i'm a fan of either kozelek or ac/dc, but because i like the concept. the execution, alas, is another matter. admittedly there is a point of sympathy between kozelek and ac/dc: their ""musical stylings"" are both rigidly one-dimensional. but whereas the originals have a menacingly juvenile, raucous flair, kozelek's covers are morbidly sensitive affairs. some advice mark: get a girlfriend/pet/houseplant/hobby/whatever."
5,why did I wait so long?,"the Red House Painters were a band I heard of MANY times but never actually listened to. It was in winter 2001 when I heard ""Mistress"" on an old 1993 CD compilation. After getting hooked on the RHP right away, a friend recomended ""Rock and Roll Singer"" and ""What's Next To The Moon"", but for some reason I never picked them up. What a big mistake. I still Don't have Rock and Roll Singer but I just got a hold of What's Next To The Moon and I absolutely love this CD. All AC/DC songs done acoustic and mellow. I would HIGHLY recomend this CD to any fan of the RHP. Honestly, I think this CD blows away ANYTHING that Mark has done in the past."
5,Niki Daly and Jamela are our favourites,"My kids just love Jamela. It is so good for kids to read about children in other countries. Children without hundreds of toys and endless pressure on them, but with a loving family and community where fun things happen. We also enjoyed ""christmas"" and Yebo Jamela."
5,excellent,"my granddaughter and I have read this book a dozen times since Christmas, when Santa brought her the book. She has taken it to school to share with the other girls. It is a total joy. It would have been even better, it there would have been a little explanation of the country the story was taking place in."
5,Wow.... still amazing after all these years.,"Kid Creole holds up well. Still a standout on an ipod--these songs SING! There's more PLEASING musical inventiveness here than in half of 2010's entire musical output. Just a quick comparison to the tinny twee tripe that's churned out daily makes one cry for an earlier, more talent-filled time. I miss you Kid, and the Coconuts too. A wonderful album."
1,Does not work,"Causes sticky flickering green pixels that just seem to grow in number the longer you use your computer. After a while your computer will be full of twinkling little pixels. If this is acceptable go for it, all others you've been advised."
5,High Quality + Low Cost = PERFECT Solution!,"Prior to purchasing this Monster brand adapter, I purchased a generic adapter for a couple of dollars here on Amazon. Unfortunately, the generic adapter was cheaply made and the HDMI plug broke off the very first time I plugged it into my DVD player and tried to unplug it. I replaced it with this Monster adapter and couldn't be happier. For only a few dollars more, this Monster adapter fits the bill and is performing its job nicely. I was surprised to find this exact same plug at Radio Shack for nearly four times the amount you can purchase here on Amazon!"
1,DVI end doesn't accomodate industry standard male DVI pins/prongs and thus won't fit many male monitor DVI cable plugs,"I bought this to convert an HDMI port on an AMD graphics card to DVI to use with one of my Dell monitors that has a standard male DVI plug on the end of its interface cable. The monitor and its cable have been used successfully with multiple female DVI plugs/ports in the past on various graphics cards without any problems. This adapter lacked some of the pin/prong holes that the male DVI plug at the end of the monitor's cable had, and thus, I could not plug the monitor into the adapter's female DVI end. In other words, the adapter didn't have the holes to accommodate those pins/prongs. This made the product basically worthless for me since I couldn't even plug my display device into it. I was surprised with this being a premium brand, Monster, that it would not support industry standard DVI pin/prong holes correctly."
1,CD MisPrint,"The CD ordered was correctly labeled on box and on CD, problem was the recording was not as described. Vendor provided a refund with no quarrel. Still lost shipping costs both ways."
5,"most excellent, brilliant book I've read in a long time","People of the Wolf is such a good book. It has everything, love, adventure, hate, passion. It is mind blowing....cant wait to read People of the Lightning. I would recommend this book to everyone. The authors should take a bow..."
5,People of Silence,"""People of the Silence,"" was one of my favorite books of the series. If I had my life to live over, I would be an archeologist! I especially like the foreword leading into the story. - - Jo Anne W. Brooks"
5,"Thoroughly Inspiring, Delightfully Educational","This is my favorite of the ""People..."" books. All of the books in this series are an awesome blend of archaeological and anthropological facts and fantastical creativity, but this particular novel stood out above the rest for me. I am not sure of the reason that should be. Maybe it is my natural affinity for the geographical area covered in the novel or the build-up of mystery in the story. It kept me guessing at different situations throughout the book. This book has a great combination of inspiration, romance, action and intrigue and I would recommend it to anyone who can appreciate the history of the land or even just a great story."
4,Among The Best In This Series,"Engaging novel set among the Anasazi of the 1200's. Probably as close to an actual living breathing recreation of that culture as anyone will ever write. These authors do not begin with a modern Christian perspective and proceed from there, they take the good and bad, humorous and shocking of a past nation and tell it like it was, ""warts and all.'"
5,I'm going to Chaco,"In People of the Silence, the Gears have done it again. Only better. Their attention to details is carefully woven into an epic who-done-it fiction that also includes brief references to People of the Wolf, Sea, Fire and River. My next vacation is to Chaco -- via Cahokia!"
5,hate to see the story end,"I have read all of the ""The People"" series and just started ""The People of the Mist"". I anxiously await each new book. They are entertaining and informative at the same time. When a book can make me feel like I'm there, the author has hit his mark. Keep them coming"
3,ok decent,"ok decent album from the mid 70s, good songs but some can get boring at times, if you liked this album back in those days this is a nice remastered version with a great informative booklet."
5,Challenging & Inspiring,"An inspiring biography about a missionary written by a missionary. Elizabeth looks at Miss Carmichael's life of devotion to God thru her writings and the memories of the missionaries and children she worked with. The book shows Miss Carmichael's struggles and mistakes, but focuses on her dedication to obeying God's call and living her life to serve the ""least of these."" The book will challenge you to look at your devotion and obedience to God and inspire you to think beyond your self with God's heart for the lost."
4,A life-touching/changing book,"English is not my first language so some of the contents that are in old fashion English was more challenging to me, but the biography was well written. It covered almost all the areas of Amy Carmichael's life that one can think of from an objective view. This book described a dream life for true disciples of Christ."
5,nothing less than being with God all along the day,"After all the details given in the previous reviews, I just want to add how I was touched by this book, by Amy Carmichael' sincerity and love.Nothing less than being with God all along the day, a program I would like to follow myself.Her faith is really inspiring "" if you had faith as small as a mustard seed you could say to this mountain, 'move from here to there,' and it would move. Nothing would be impossible.""She believed in these words."
3,Nationalism.,"The main idea of this book is that nationalism was the driving force behind world history in the twentieth century, and not economics or (for Marxists) ideology (economic classes).The two world wars were battles for power, not for money.I agree with this proposition.Unfortunately, this book is difficult to swallow, because the author fills it with nearly meaningless fragments of his personal diary. Into the bargain, his tone is arrogant and self-satisfied.So, I like the song, not the singer."
5,Great Reference,"'Java Enterprise in a Nutshell' by Jim Farley is a great reference book to examine the entire suite of Java enterprise tools and APIs. Covered topics in the book include:JavaServletsJava Server Pages (JSP)JUnit, Cactus, AntJavaBeans, JavaMail, Java Message Service (JMS)JavaServer Faces (JSF) and Struts+ too many more to list here!!All in all, this is a great book that looks at the Java solution as a whole. If you want to quickly ramp up your knowledge on getting your Java setup running immediately, pick up a copy of this book.***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
2,Disappointing,"Warning to all buyers, the 3rd edition of this book does not include the J2EE library reference. While I realize this information is available online, having a printed form of library references is the primary reason I buy the ""in a nutshell"" series. Included in this book is a very general overview of various enterprise technologies, which unlike the very useful language reference include in other ""in a nutshell"" books, seems too broad and shallow to be useful. Any developer serious about working in JSP, for example, would be better served buying a book on JSP. Admittedly I just received this book so I can provide a cursory commentary on the usefulness of the material, but the lack of library details alone would have made me not purchase it if I was browsing in a store."
3,Quick read on J2EE 1.4,"From a J2EE developer perspective, this book does a quick introduction the newer J2EE 1.4 API features but it lacks the details on explanation of where, when and how to use them in a real-world scenario. I am little bit disappointed about this book as it does'nt add much value while comparing to Sun J2EE 1.4 blueprints. This book also introduces other Java technologies such as Struts, Hibernate but it falls short on explaining when to use them and how to put them together in an enterprise application."
4,"Not as deep as some, but great value for money","One of the seemingly endless ""in a Nutshell"" series from O'Reilly, this book follows the basic series format. A few chapters of concise introduction followed by a detailed, if compressed, API reference. In this case the book covers a lot of ground - all the Java APIs which form part of the Java 2 Enterprise Edition: JDBC, RMI, CORBA, JNDI, Servlets, EJB as well as some material on JMS. Check which edition you get as the information dates quickly, though.I was worried when I bought this book that they were attempting to cover too much, but I think they have done a remarkable job. This book really is the most readable introduction to J2EE I have found so far. It's just about small enough to carry about (unlike the massive Wrox tomes), and the API reference can help to keep it useful after you've absorbed the introductory material. It even has a basic SQL reference, which you don't get in some JDBC books!"
4,Great for Overview!,"First of All, this book does not cover everything about J2EE,but it has many of the significant things related to J2EE (such as CORBA,IIOP).In my opinion,this book is very suitable for any person who need to have a J2EE overview/introduction.And also suit for J2EE developer who need the good references rather than print all J2EE API.I recommend you to put it on the bookshelf!..."
3,A lot of shortcomings,"This is the first O'Reilly-book I'm a bit of disappointed with.""Java Enterprise in a Nutshell"" simply ignores a lot of APIs/packages of the J2EE, like javax.servlet.jsp, javax.naming.event, javax.naming.ldap or the whole javax.mail-API, some of which surely have a great practical relevance. On the other hand it has a quick reference of SQL, something that does not really belong here. It wouldn't have disturbed me, if all relevant APIs had been covered, but they hadn't.All covered APIs on the other hand are as good dealt with as always.Because of the given shortcomings: just 3 stars."
2,Soporific pastoral,This is a pretty lifeless recording of the Beethoven 6th; the 'thunderstorm' doesn't storm and the slow movement shouldn't be played if you're driving as it may put you to sleep. Look elsewhere.
3,Slow start but average to a bit above eventually,"This got off to a slow start. We have playboy Aamir Khan being extremely irritating as the egoist (strangely he can do that very effectively as he has elsewhere!) to the point where my 28 year old co-viewer abandoned it.As he began to really fall love and redeem himself the movie settled down into an average to slightly above average romance. The couple are both individually off to meet their fiancees but vow to set things right and meet in 6 months if they still want to be together. Events transpire so that one can't make it....There is some OK dancing, nothing standout in the songs but they were OK. I didn't feel the chemistry between Aamir and Manisha Koirala was as convincing as he has been with others. OK movie and will stand the test of whether I hang onto it but not in my favorites group. Movie wquality is acceptable given its age (1999).Elsewhere on the Net it seems to rate mostly as a 6 out of 10."
3,"Great look, poor quality","I'm on my second case like this from BoxWave. I ordered a second b/c i like it so much, however the reason for replacement is b/c the plastic pieces that help snap the cover onto the computer are very small and break easily. I'll just have to be more careful this time. Otherwise, I get so many compliments on this cover and it fits great!"
4,This is one insane slab o' drone...,"Compelling debut disc from Boris.Monumentally dense, eerily repetitive and hugely atmospheric, this disc grows richer with repeated listenings.Absolutego represents a significant precursor to the sparer, more up-tempo Amplifier Worship that was to follow, and serves well to document the auspicious debut of an adventurous band that continues to astonish with each successive (and surprisingly varied) release.The Special Low Frequency Version is recommended for maximum sonic impact."
4,A musical autobiography of Les Paul & Mary Ford's legacy,"This CD, although it does feature the studio recordings of many of their hits, is unique in that it features introductions to many of the tracks taken from radio transcriptions featuring Les and Mary making it sort of a musical autobiography as opposed to just your standard greatest hits package. There is canned applause at the end of each track that lasts about 5-7 seconds though but other than that, this is a must have, even for those fans who have the Legend and The Legacy boxed set just for the introductions alone as they exhibit both Les's and Mary's sense of humor perfectly. The one star being docked off is due to the canned applause at the end of each track."
5,works great,I needed an easy way to apply liquid groud sterilizer and the Chapin 6005 did that for me. I looked at a similar product from MiracleGro at a local store but the current version of their product is geared to only dispense their products and it wasn't going to be easy to figure out the rate at which I was applying the sterilizer. This sprayer let me easily set the application ratio as well as see how much mix I was making in the canister like the old MiracleGro sprayers used to do so I am very glad that I chose this one. The instructions that come with it are also very easy to understand if you need to use a dry fertilizer.
3,Don't lose the directions,"I can't complain about the unit. However if you lose the directions and forget what all the formulas mean on the unit, it is useless. They should put the directions on the bottle for those of us who carelessly put directions in piles of papers or who have simple forgotten where they were filed."
1,Not what I expected,I recently purchased this sprayer thinking I could adjust teaspoons and tablespoons for the dry mix fertilizer.It is only adjustable for liquid. I decided to use it anyway and after one use it is already broken. Instead of 1 Tablespoon per gallon it is putting out about 10 per gallon.Ended up just throwing it away.Waste of money.
4,Really Good Book on Palmistry,"I enjoyed this book and feel it belongs in anyone who is interested in hand reading's library. The book is very well laid out, lots of big, good, ez to read pictures. No, there is nothing earth-shattering in here...but the basics are laid out in a way that is so easy to grasp.Pick it up and enjoy this book. I did."
5,Excellent book with great pics,Often palmistry books get a bit skewed becoz of the poor quality pics. This book's main positive point is the clarity of the pictures it has. It makes understanding the lines and what they mean more easier and meaningful.I would recommend this to any new beginners and experts as well.
2,Too advanced for beginners!,"I found this book impossible to use! The photos and illustrations were so detailed, with lines traveling everywhere, that I couldn't transfer what I saw on the page to what I saw on my hand. I was disappointed."
1,Content is Out-of-Date,"I purchased this in 1997 and even then, the content was out of date. Bad URLs, Netscape Navigator 1.1, and WebStar? I can't believe this book is still listed as being in print. Another reviewer mentioned the heavy use of HoTMetaL-- do yourself a favor. Get Homesite, Dreamweaver or FrontPage, and you'll be much better off.You're not going to be creating any great-looking documents with this dead dog."
2,"Too much emphasis on the program ""HoTMetaL Pro""","I received this book from a colleague. I was hoping touse it as an HTML reference, but I didn't find it veryuseful for that.It is very heavy on instruction in the software includedon the CD-ROM. If you are interested in Windowsshareware, this may be useful to you. If you aren'ton Windows, I would not recommend the book."
4,one of the better recordings,"this is an old recording, but the piece is masterfully played. main downside is the sort of thin sound quality."
5,WCW BASH AT THE BEACH 1996,"This is my vote for the greatest PPV of all time. Every match shows the stars in it at their peak. Nasty Boys vs Public Enemy and DDP vs Jim Duggan were a lot of fun, and the Horsemen are at their best, too. But the main event, our boys Savage, Sting, and the Total Package vs Hall, Nash, and Hogan was a masterpiece that will leave you in tears. A classic from start to finish."
3,Bash at the beach 1996 and starcade 1997,It could of bean bettter. I would like to of seen more blood. The only reason why I watched it was because of Scott Hall and Kevin Nnash.If you wont to see a good video I would Rackremand Starcade 1997! Halloween Havioc 1991 and 1998. World war 4 1998.
2,WCW Bash at the Beach 1996 Review,"This event is the birthplace of the New World Order, and also where Hulk Hogan turned his back on all the little ""Hulkamaniacs"" out there. I loved it! Well, the undercard left something to be desired. I mean, they couldn't come up with anything better than Ray Traylor vs. John Tenta in a ""Silver Dollar on a Pole"" match? For all the people looking for the best deal, do not buy this video from Amazon. You can get this video from Hastings for $13. Although I must warn you, if you're one of those ""fans"" that can't stand a slow-paced match, then you shouldn't even watch this video. Nowadays, many people call themselves fans but have the nerve to chant ""boring!"" when the match isn't going 100 miles an hour. So please, if you're one of those fans, then don't waste your money. But for all the real fans out there, this is a decent video. This video is recommended, but not highly."

5,Defining moment in wrestling history,This was the greatest PPV and the greatest writing angle in wrestling history period. No one will ever redo anything this good. Birth of the NWO.
5,the Holy Grail of Coin Magic!!!,"Straight out of the pages of the classic J.B. BoBo ""coin bible"" Modern Coin Magic! Some of those sleights that may have seemed incomprehensible in print are now available on dvd. Who could ask for anything more? This illustrious 4 dvd set is a must have for anyone even remotely interested in coin magic. From the novice to the working pro,there is somthing to be gleaned from this masterwork.The price was so astonishing, I keep waiting on the Police to knock on my door to take it back! The only thing I didn't like was before I placed the order I was told that it would arrive in 8 days. After making the purchase it turned out it was closer to 16 days,I digress, oh well! Anyway, Buy!!Buy!!!....uh...I meant, so long! Lol!!"
3,Blue Bottle Mystery:An Asperger's Adventure,"We were disappointed, my husband and I both read the book but do not think it would be a good book for our 11 year old (recently diagnosised) with Aspergers Syndrome. It might be a good book to read if you don't have Aspergers and want to understand how an ""Aspie"" thinks and feels. We don't want him to think he did something wrong because his life doesn't turnout ""peachy keen"" like the character ""Ben's"" does. Perhaps we're too protective but it was way too much fantasy and we didn't want our son to end up disappointed. I would recommend the book for introducing Asperger's to classmates of an Aspie."
4,"""Can we get the sequel, Mom?""","We finished this book tonight, and my 8-year-old son with Asperger's immediately asked me if we could get the sequel. You bet!Wish the publisher would do a U.S. version, since some of the Aussie slang is a little hard for an American kid to understand. And my son would've liked a more thorough solution to the ""mystery"". But all-in-all, a very nice book."
1,Negative slant on Asperger's - Not encouraging for AS kids,"This book is not written in a way that a child with AS would understand or appreciate. The abundance of slang words from this Australian author will leave children confused as it is not familiar to Americans, much less ""literal-thinking"" Asperger kids who have trouble with comprehension anyway. The reference to the dad gambling with his Asperger son was ridiculous. The father yelling at his AS son many times, ""What's wrong with you kid?...Why can't you be normal for a change?...(he) doesn't need a doctor, he needs a good spanking..."" The dad in the book behaves out of anger/frustration and certainly inappropriately and somewhat cruelly. Asperger kids should be taught that they are wonderful in their differences! This story would cause my child to think he was different in a bad way. No way! Choose a different book that encourages your child."
2,Negative description of Aspergers,"I bought this book to give to my 7-year-old Aspie boy for Christmas. The first thing I did was read the chapter on Aspergers. I did not like the way the doctor described Aspergers--""problem with the brain."" It's not a problem; it's different. I had my husband read it, too, and he said the same thing. We're returning the book."
1,Not practical,"Both the teacher (emotionally demanding) and the parent (materialistic and shallow) are presened in a very bad light. While the book is fiction, the resolutions (without giving any portion of the book away) are not in any way practical to the very real challenges of raising a child with special needs. While AS does have it's challenges, it should simply be presented as a ""different way of being"", so that the child with AS may prepare him/herself for life in an appropriate and practical way, to the best of his/her ability, and not to rely on the chance solutions presented in this book."
4,"Review of ""Lights Out Tonight"", Mary Jane Clark, author","I enjoyed this book as I have enjoyed other Mary Jane Clark books. It is pleasant reading and kept me guessing. I did not ""peg"" the killer. Will buy future books by Mary Jane Clark."
2,The only thing that saved this book was the suspense.,"The characters in this mystery are basically shallow and annoying...or maybe the problem is with the author and her complete lack of character development. The writing is juvenile and the whole summer theater setting is just a bit silly. The only reason I gave this book two stars instead of one is because the author was able to keep me wondering who ""the killer"" was up until the last fifty pages or so, at which point it gets pretty easy to figure out."
3,"She Would Have to Choose, But Either Way She Would Lose","Miss Deirdre Weaton was in a pucker. She had never looked to marry. Certainly not to someone as grand as Lord Wrotham.But there was no help for it. She was unable to resist his charms, though for the sake of her first love, she fervently wished she could.How could she love a man with her heart, knowing all the while she would have to abandon her soul?"
4,These are twist-offs!,"I paid to download this performance and feel like I totally got my money's worth! Here's what you're getting: Crappy visuals, coupled with new songs, old favoraties and GREAT comedic lines. Crank up the tunes and learn how Rocky Balboa made himself out of Porkchops and Rice!"
3,Fun french movie,Its a great french and funny movie for tintin fans but it says that the language is in english but it is only in french with no subtitles.... so that was very disapointing for me...
3,"Good, but not Great","This film is not better than the previous one, ""Mystere de la Toison D'Or"", but it is entertaining. Again, it has no English dubbing nor subtitles. All in French, mon ami!"
1,Money wasted,"Unlike the version available from Australia,(Region 4) this version does not have English sub-titles.This fact was only discovered after opening the DVD and playing for a few minutes.It could have stated clearly that there were no sub-titles available on this Region 1 version of the film.Thus my grandchildren have a DVD which is altogether meaningless to them. Money wasted because the online description was not detailed sufficiently."
5,Favorite,I listen to this all the time and never weary of the tunes. Thankfully it is not rock and roll!
5,"Cocoa goat cheese, funky but good",This is pretty neat. The first taste is cocoa (not chocolate) with fresh curd but than the goat cheese flavor kicks in and gives a very different aftertaste. Quite enjoyable.
1,The cover illustration sort of matches the contents,"You won't learn a damned thing about economics from reading this book, because it is almost 100% gibberish. I mean, ""gibberish,"" as in a completely disconnected series of points littered with academic jargon that sounds intelligent at first blush, but upon closer examination is devoid of coherence. I keep it on my shelf as an example of what nonsense looks like."
5,an eye opener,"As a life long ""Libertarian"", I read this book for a different perspective. It's hard to believe the now narcissistic and bloviating LaRouche used to have such a razor sharp vision of things. The Hamiltonian theory of economics needed to be taught in High School and college. Of course, I guess that's asking a lot, since most college grads can barely read and write.Oh well, it's too late now. Bring on the dark age of austerity and privatization!"
5,Great fantasy/horror book!,"I enjoyed the book, and am looking forward to the sequels. I really liked the whole mythological creatures that have certain ""rules"" they have to follow. Like the fact that the sandman cant do anything to you if your asleep. I recommend it."
4,Legends Come to Life,"This action-packed adventure story uses mythology and legend from all over the world. Some of the characters remind one of childhood; however, this book explores the dark side of folklore. Fans of the supernatural and the horrific aspect of fairytales will be well entertained by this novel which alternates between a magical parallel world and our contemporary mundane one. I believe this is the first book of a trilogy. Total cliff-hanger ending. You will be compelled to read the next one.Michael Travis Jasper, Author of the Novel ""To Be Chosen"""
3,Myth Hunters ain't no Shadow Saga!,"Man, I love this author, but this latest let me down.I was hoping for a more bloody, rousing adventure here, along the same textures of Chris Golden's awesome Shadow Saga.But alas, it wasn't to be. Even his two Menagerie novels were much more entertaining this this one. This had a great idea, but after about halfway thru it, I unfortunately found myself speed-reading it just to finish. Not a good sign.Please, Mr. Golden, write another Shadow Saga or Menagerie novel instead!"
5,Alec Guinness reading Peter and the Wolf!,"Since the Peter Ustinov reading of this fine kids' tale has unhappily vanished from the catalogue, this Guiness reading (which is not mentioned in the Amazon.com listing!) is far and away the best available The Fiedler performance is acceptable if not distinguished.Peter Brawley"
4,Beyond the Sea,"Some artists are original, and some are not. In general, the music is good, but some of the songs are a bit ""jazzy."" Over-all, the CD is well done."
3,Not my usual type of book,"This was a very disturbing book from the first page. I had to keep backtracking to keep up with who was who. The subject matter was evident to me from the beginning. A young man being attracted to his sexual mother is probably not too far out, especially with the envirement he was raised around. I still can't get the names straight except for Sweet Mister. The ending just dropped you on your head. I probably will never read another novel by this author. It is not something I want to waste my time reading and not enjoying again."
4,Not sure what to say....,I will start out by saying...I live in the same area as Mr.Woodrell and was excited when I found out we have an author in our midst...as I am an avid reader..I wanted to read some of his work...His book started slow...and it was a little hard to stay interested ... it did get more interesting..but wow...did it take a twisted turn...I will let you all draw your own conclusions..
3,"Red, what an ...","The Death of Sweet Mister is a very well written novel. Red has to be one of the biggest [villians] in literary history. There was no problem, specifically with Death of Sweet Mister. I would just say that it lacked drama when drama was most called for, and the in general [feel] of it all lacked the southern gothic feel perhaps woodrell was going for. A good read, albeit not an extrodinary one."
4,A little creepy,This book is very raw. I couldn't put it down.It leaves you wanting more from the characters.It's not for the under 18 crowd.
2,Did Not Like,This was a sad book from beginning to end. I read all of it expecting it get better but sadly it didn't. I simply did not like the book and do not recommend it.
3,Eh,"Well, I seem to be the only person in the universe who didn't particularly like it. I was particularly annoyed by one of Woodrell's affectations, using ""did ______"" instead of the past tense, as in ""he did speak"" instead of ""he spoke"". He did do it over and over again. Also, the murder, which should have been a dramatic moment, was covered in a sentence. And it did bug me. I wish I could have been blown away as everyone who's reviewed it anywhere seems to be. And it did sadden me that it didn't."
1,The Death of Sweet Mister,The only thing I liked about this book was that it was free. I didn't like any of the characters. Detested what they stand for. Hated there interaction.
5,sharris,"Daniel Woodrell is my new ""favorite Author"". The characters that he brings to life so wonderfully are people that I identify with. People that I know. These characters would normally be overlooked by a majority of people but Mr. Woodrell weaves fantastic, complex, and sometimes unnerving stories with these Ozark folks. I took a three day bike trip to the Missouri Ozarks last summer and camped on the Black River for a few days. That is before I had read any of Woodrell's books. Had I read them before, I would've probably been a little more paranoid when I heard things go bump in the night."
4,dark and realistic,"Woodrell is the master of the dark and disturbing stories that lie behind simple country folks in rural locations. Contrary to the popular image of small towns as idyllic places full of upstanding citizens, Woodrell's places are occupied by the underbelly of society. Crime, drugs, violence and incest all get covered here in a completely believable and realistic fashion. If you like old noir masters like Jim Thompson (The Killer Inside of Me) you will find a lot to love in Daniel Woodrell's characters. The Death of Sweet Mister has the right mix of sympathetic yet very flawed characters, the suspense of impending violence, and a disturbing and unexpected ending. This is Woodrell at his best -- too literary and well written to be dismissed as just ""mystery"" or ""crime"" fiction,"" but well told and exciting enough to be accessible to the reader who just wants to be entertained."
4,"Love :Sweet Mister""",I loved this book and its colorful but pathetic characters. I could not put it down. The cadence of Woodrell's writting is brilliant and can't wait to read the rest of his books.
1,Do not buy!,"This pump controller is a great idea, however the relay inside it is cheap and fails in short order. I have 2 zoeller pumps in my sump. each one on its own switch. i had purchased 3 switches. in 5 months, 2 of the switches are gone due to bad relays. i am on my last switch which was supposed to be a backup but now its the only one operable. i just ordered a similair concept switch from another company and i am hoping it is built more reliably. wayne pumps wasnt always the manufacturer of this switch. they took over the design a few years ago. the previous one from the old manufacturer lasted 5 years before it was destroyed in an accident. it would probably still be working today.dont buy this, keep looking! sump pump items are mission critical devices and should not be built this way!"
3,"OK, but wire in sump should have a better tip","This product works as claimed but the single wire that goes into the sump to determine water level has a thin stranded wire that is exposed about an inch and they silver the tip, After a few months it doesn;t work and you have to clean the tip, strip off some more insulation and put it back i the sump. Would be nice to have a real tip of some sort in the water that can take the punishment."
1,Failed just over a year later,"This unit worked great for about a year, now it fails to turn on when the water level goes above the wire inside the pit.I can measure the resistance between the ground prong on the pump and the wire, it's around 20k ohms. So it's not a problem with the wire in the pit. I can measure a similar resistance between the ground prong on the pump and sticking the other lead of the ohm meter into the ground (ground is pretty wet)The pump still operates if I plug it directly into the wall.I'm at a loss now what sort of switch to get. I thought this one would be it for good."
1,Doesn't work,"Haven't been able to get this to work. Unfortunately, I've kept it too long for a return, fiddling around and testing it several times.I would not recommend a purchase."
1,Kindle Version is awful,Really a pity they didn't bother to format the book correctly. What you will see is a small image of the original page with the original text and then large text which doesn't even match the page.
5,a very fun book,"A very delightful and fun book. I highly and enthusiastically recommend it for anyone of any age older than, say, four."
3,Disappointed in soft cover,"This is one of my favorite children's books about San Francisco - my sons loved it - Somehow I missed it was a soft cover when I ordered, so it was disappointing as it was a gift."
4,An undiscovered gem,I read this title to my first grade library class during a unit on the works of Virginia Lee Burton each year and they enjoy it. We discuss cable cars beforehand and then read it. They really appreciate the artwork and story. Another fine piece of children's literature by Mrs. Burton.
5,Maybelle,I just bought this book for my 4-year-old son (and myself!). He loves it. The book is about cable cars in San Francisco and is practically a history lesson. It's also fun!
5,Great history lesson with a great story!!,"My kids love this book so much, we took them to San Francisco to ride the cable cars themselves and went to the cable car museum!"
3,One Good Boogie Deserves Another,"Love the music,the remastering leaves a bit to be desired, it sounds a bit flat in places, however this does happen. As always thanks Amazon for the prompt delivery to South Africa."
4,Crochet for Christmas Star Book,This booklet of vintage patterns will fit my needs nicely. The patterns are fairly easy to follow. I think they will make really nice free-standing motifs or used in an afghan just as easily.
5,id give it 100 stars if i could,"...have listened to this cd front to back probably about 500 times, and every time around it gets better than the last. true musicians, sublime is able to mix a perfect amount of reggae, hip-hop, ska, punk, you name it into their music and the result is simply impecible. in my eyes, best cd of all time hands down. has aged perfectly with me and i am now able to truly appreciate just how good sublime really is; this cd gets better with time, a real classic."
5,Five stars and then some,"Sublime is one of those bands where it's pretty much impossible to describe in one word. Their type of music is so diverse, it has a little bit of everything (ska, punk, rap, rock, reggae, hip hop, surfer, etc.) in it. That's probably why so many people like them. Every song on this album is practically a classic, and so it's really hard to choose favorites. I truly think that this is one of the best albums of our time. What's so great about this album is that it isn't full of depressing songs like so many are today, which is great because you aren't left in a bad mood once you listen to it. It's really hard to do this album justice because there's so much to be said about it. This is one of my favorite CD's, to the point where I'm on my second copy because I wore my first one out. Anyway, I would definitely suggest picking up this album!"
5,The Greatest Album of the Decade,"It really is! Despite their popular success, Sublime was one of the truly creative bands of the 90's. When I first heard them I was drowning in a sea of imitators and wannabes. Sublime incorporates but doesn't imitate. It is the best album of the 90's so far."
5,this is the best cd in the world!,"o.k., if i had to live with only one cd, it would be this one. sublime's original reggae-inspired laid back punk with an attitude is in a class of its own. it does not fit into any one music category, just brings the best ones all together. every song is perfect for the beach, a party, or just chillin' music. no one has ever been able to come close to this album, where every song rocks, and you don't skip any!"
5,Hit that sold me!,"This cd was the one that ""sold me"" on sublime. I originally owned it in a cassette tape, then upgraded to a cd. It has 22 tracks, definitely giving you your money's worth. It makes good transitions between the reggae-ish, and ska-punk-ish songs. From the beginning to the end, you can sing along with all the songs. Brad's thank you's are done like a song at the end and it is graet.THis a great cd for anything. Your car, parties, the beach, it provides a summery-party feel. You don't have to be a sublime fan to love this cd. It is a classic."
5,f'in sweet,"If you're a sublime fan and you don't have this album your not a sublime fan. This is by far the best record they put out in the short time they were a band. Everything about the album is so great, especially brad's vocals and lyrics. This is probably my favorite CD I own and the one I play the most. Sublime is such a great band because their so unique and you can't mix up their sound with any other band. If you don't think this is a good CD then you gotta go listen to some better music. Go buy this CD right now you won't be disapointed"
3,Bout 26 oz are free,"3 1/2Definitely one of those adolescent classics that helps through high school, this potential adult classic is sidetracked by some repetitious fatty compositions that could have been trimmed. Still, the amount and variety with which Sublime debuted their reggae-rock-ska-rap sound still shines through on the majority of this debut, undoubtedly signifying the oncoming of a special talent that was sadly extinguished way too soon."
5,Pure Magic,"This CD is Pure Magic and beauty to ones ears, any music lover will agree. They mix Ska Punk and Reggae sounds all cultivating to one perfect blend: Sublime.40 oz. To freedom is the Best CD the have ever put out and is deffenitly one of the albums everyone should own."
2,prob the most overrated album of all time...,"Go to any party or pull up to any car packed with a bunch of teenagers and you will hear this. And why? i dont know. Are the lyrics good? No, will lyrics like ""don't feel too sorry for his kind, now that he gets it in the behind"" how could they be. Is the music complex or diverse? No, its the same drums and guitar over and over again. The only thing it has is catchyness which young people love, just like like your greenday, black eye peas, and other crap of today."
2,this is for prepubscent boys,"i first heard this album when i was 13 years old. at the time i absolutely loved it! it was one of the most original things i had ever heard. then i heard fishbone, RHCP, living colour, bad brains, and all that and i totally ignored sublime after that.the only good songs on this are covers, and not even good ones at that. this album is a complete waste of time. what's worse is that it's their best album.basically...this band sucks. hard. don't buy into it, there is far better music out there. funny thing is that i'm sure the band would actually agree with me. just don't waste your time with this crap."
1,Yo!,"These songs rock. ""We're Only Gonna Die"" especially. It's got rad lyrics. Bad Religion's Greg Graffin is a good songwriter. ""Hope"" is cool too, loved the original Descendents version. Same goes for the Toyes' ""Smoke Two Joints."" Also, Toots & the Maytals' ""54-46 That's My Number."" And the Grateful Dead's ""Scarlet Begonias,"" but they changed the lyrics around on that one, so I don't know. I guess they made up for it by using a whole bunch of Beastie Boy lyrics halfway through ""Don't Push.""Hey, while we're at it, I also dug recognizing all those wonderful soundbites lifted from the Specials, the Minutemen, more Beastie Boys...That unlisted shout out at the end is pretty thumping as well. Big ups."
1,"Sublime was ok, but now they just [stink]","This album is surprising i cant believe it, i am shocked they would write stuff like this, this isnt even music, this is just strumming like my 4 year old brother does i mean come on get some talent and at least write some real lyrics."
5,Bradley was my heroin,"I think Gwen Stefani put it best back in '96 when she said, ""Most musicians, like myself, reside on one playing field. Bradley was simply on a level that most of us will never know"". She was speaking of course of his unprecedented ability to understand many different forms of music, and then combine them into one sound, a process that is all but unsuccessful by most musicians.This album is perfection, an absolute pleasure to listen to, no matter how many times its been heard. The Sublime sound was heaven. It was Sublime.If possible, find the version with the original ""Get Out"", which has all the licks from Led Zeppelin's ""Moby Dick"" and ""The Lemon Song"" and then make sure you don't scratch it, because one day it will be worth some cash."
5,By far the best Sublime album and simply the best album,"Sublime kicks out a wide range of styles and sounds that sound great togather. It spans from funk to punk and is mostly unseen by most softcore Sublime fans, but this album is a must buy for any music lovers out there and you will be glad you did."
5,Awesome,"[...]This is by far my favorite CD ever. It has everything that I love. Meaningful lyrics and great musicianship. The best song on this CD, in my opinion is 5446 Ball n Chain. I love the little saxophone at the end.Hmm...Other classics on this album INCLUDE:Hope( cover ), We're only gunna die ( Cover ) , Scarlet Begonias ( cover ), Date Rape, Badfish, Ebin, Rivers of Babylon. 5446 Ball n ChainAnd yes, Bradley DOES give credit at the end of the CD.RIP Bradley NowellMay your words echo throughout the world forever."
5,A Great Album by a Great Band,"Brad and crews first release. Brad was a gifted song writter and had a flare for making timeless music by blending different styles into his own, while not using any gimmics that would date his music to a particular era. After this album many thought they given everything they had and would not be able to follow it up. Not only was that not the case with the self titled album proving Sublime was going to just get better and better, but the other members after Brad's death have come into their own first forming the Long Beach Dub Allstars then spliting up to form Eyes Adrift, & Long Beach Shortbus. Other great albums by Eric and Bud include Diet Christ, Juice Bros. (see Long Beach Blvd. comp.), & Del Noah and the Mt. Araratfinks. Also find Eric and Bud guesting on Corn Doggy Dog's - Good Clean Filth."
4,good service....,I recieved the CD a day before it was due to arrive. It was also in excellent condition when I got it. This is the first experience i've had ordering any product through amazon. I will definately do so again.
3,Uneven with hints at what's to come,"A fun, but uneven album. I hear hints of the great work to come on the self-titled album. Ruby Begonias is probably my highlight here. I really admire what Bradley could do when he was on his game, but I find things a little too rough for my tastes on most of this album."
4,Best Sublime Album,"This album was an 'expansion' on what Sublime did in their self-titled CD. They took the ska-rock sound and played with it several ways to create a fun, fast-paced, enjoyable record. Some songs lean more towards the ska side [Live at E's] or towards the rock side [40oz. to Freedom] which makes it fun listening too.""Date Rape"" shows Sublime's amazing creativity by taking a serious subject and getting the listener to chuckle a few times, as well as groove along with it.If you've never heard Sublime before, I'd recommend starting with their self-titled CD, but, if you want more Sublime, this is the CD for you, as it has a little bit of everything."
5,THE BEST ALBUM ON THE MARKET SINCE 1992!!!!!,"I'VE NEVER HEARD ANYTHING AS GOOD AS SUBLIME. KEYWORD ""SUBLIME""!!! I GIVE THIS ALBUM 500 STARS! EVERY SONG (TO ME) IS AWESOME. ESPECIALLY 5446 AND DON'T PUSH."
1,"warning folks, warning","Warning folks! Much like several of their other albums, this one is gonna be a huge disappointment to the fans that are simply intending to have a collection of Sublime's many great hits. Like numerous other artists I can think of, they have taken the low road yet again on this album and have come up with poorly re-mixed versions of their originals. I can only assume that the goal is wanting consumers to purchase each song (the original mix) individually for their ipods so that the most possible money can be made. The problem here is false advertising in my opinion, not only on their part (look at the album title) but even for the people at this website who make the song samplers for us to listen to - all samples of the original versions. Don't say I didn't warn you folks..."
2,sublime,product arrived quickly. Was not in proper cd holder just in generic holder so no cover art or lyrics. cd was pretty well worn too.
5,Sublime's best,"The mix of reggae,rock,punk,and the use of horns make one of the most unique sounds I have ever heard. there is just one word to describe this album; fun. Bradley Nowell is probably one of the best lead singers in a band since Mick Jagger, even better. He puts so much feeling into his singing he makes you want to sing along. ""Date Rape"" is a great song about a lesson learned by a raper and the care-free ""Smoke Two Joints"" are just two reasons to buy this album and there are many more. Buy it, it's worth every penny."
5,One of my favorite CD's ever!,"I was lucky enough to discover Sublime back when they were still doing local stuff in SoCal in the early 90's. This CD is my favorite. I've played mine so much that it literally does not work in any CD player anymore. So I decided to buy a new one. I am dismayed to see that this one is a little different than the one I had. I think I bought the original one I had at one of their gigs before they were super famous. The one I had had a song on it that was one of my favorites and it is not on this CD. It was like the 2nd or 3rd song and I'm not sure the exact title but it had lyrics like ""my place is not a home, it don't make no difference but I have found, that I need a place to stay....."" with some parts about a lady on an answering machine. I don't know why they wouldn't have it on newer versions. Oh well....I highly recommend purchasing this CD!!"
3,Review of Cruising Guide To The Northern Gulf Coast,"The guide itself is typical of a Claiborne Young cruising guide, which I have many. They have always been well written and accurate. What disappoints me concerning this guide is the title. The title says Cruising Guide To ...., Louisiana. This is not accurate, and is very misleading. The guide covers nothing west of New Orleans. The area from New Orleans to the Sabine River is the reason the Cruising Guide was purchased. For me it was a wasted purchase."
1,"THE ONLY THING ""NATIVE AMERICAN"" IN THIS BOOK IS A PICTURE","NOTHING Native about this book! Beaded Napkin Holders? Greeting Cards? Picture Frames? Clutch Bags? Cords for Glasses? Book Mark? I was looking for Native American designs in bead weaving. My Elders would of had a laugh and been insulted by the Author's use of the word ""Native."" Check it out of the library if you can find it. DO not waste your money!"
4,"Excellent, but sometimes frustrating","I loved FRENCH FOR READING, so thought I'd give this one a try. Make sure you have a dictionary because there isn't one at the back of the book - and sometimes the passages give you words you've never seen before - with no way to look them up. Also - these chapters seem a bit denser then 'French For Reading', make sure you go slowly, maybe only doing 1/2 chapter at a time."
4,Good reading practice but not for beginners,This book progresses with more difficult readings as you move through it. It has a good variety of material and many exercises to check for understanding. My only regret is that most of the material is above my beginner level. I think it will become even more useful as my Spanish improves.
4,Learn the language and get a story at the same time,"This is definately not a Beginner book in my opinion, I would say you need to be at the stage of learning spanish when you know greetings, months, dates, times, and have built some vocabulary, and asking yourself when you will get moving into something harder and more complicated. The one thing this book does lack is a definition for those words you havent learned yet. But, by now you should have bought a spanish-english dictionary and they wont be a problem for you now, since you have one already.That said, this book offers a great vocabulary building area before you actually read the short story soon to be presented to you in subsequent pages coming along. I would say for a sub-10 dollar book its worth buying and using in part of your studies. i picked mine up and hammer out a chapter now and again, and still find interest in this book.thanks for reading my review :)"
4,Helpful tool,"I have been trying to learn Spanish for a while with workbooks, tapes and through limited conversations with native speakers. This book has given me a chance to learn by reading which I realize is excellent for me because I am a visual learner. My only problem is that I bought this book on my kindle and some of the vocabulary charts are very small even when I use the Zoom feature. I am only 50% through the book but I feel very positive about it at this point."
5,Standing in the Shadows if Motown,"Standing in the Shadows of Motown is an amazing book about one of the Greatest Bass Players and Musicians that ever lived James Jameson. James Jameson, created incredible bass lines that helped create the Motown sound and influenced all bass players around the world. This book tells his life story plus gives you written music with many of his bass lines. The book also comes with recordings of other great bass players playing his bass lines."
1,great disappointment,I bought the book due to large volumes of 5 stars. To my disappointment... There is nothing extrodinary worthy of that much praise. I think Pratt's Guide to VC did a better job in terms of winning strategies and you can get it from a local library.
3,"It's ok, but there are better","I wanted to become more educated on the topic of high-tech startups, so I ordered a few from amazon.com (High Tech Startup, Engineering you Startup, plus this one). After reading the other 2 books, I found little additional benefit from this one. I skimmed quite a bit, and skipped large portions of chapters.In all fairness, if you read this book first it would probably be useful (though I'd recommend High Tech Startup instead)."
3,Not nearly as good as she says it is,"Advice in this book ranges from the moderately useful to the just plain obvious. The most valuable lesson here is the author's own promotion techniques for the book and herself.You'll notice that virtually every other ""review"" of this book includes disingenuous, artificial- seeming references to the author. Why is every reader compelled to with so many other ""reviews"", these supposed readers are actually cohorts of the author, the author herself, or members of her PR organization."
3,"Raises good questions, but there are better resources.","I found the book to be an easy read, and Ms. Chandler does raise some very valid questions and concerns, as well as having some good suggestions on business planning. But the title of the book is misleading. She does have some very good educational sections on capital and how it's reviewed, but for a solid resource on capital formation I would instead recommend High Tech Startup by John Nesheim."
4,Good basics - but it doesn't replace the real thing,"Chandler's description of the venture world is solid and informative. Reaffirming the basics of being VERY prepared before you approach VC can't be stressed enough I agree, but she writes like a girl and has too many exclamation points closing her sentences. Linda, tone down the RA! RA!There are lots of other important nuances to the process not covered. Posturing, knowing when to be humble, or when to be confident, knowing when not to talk about new stuff, knowing when to say 'no pal I'm not going to redo all the numbers so you can see it the way you want to see it'Good book, but remember, its just a book."
3,little substantive information,This book discusses many aspect of starting a company. If you are just starting By touching on many of the area a start up faces this book will help those just starting there investigation. However the author offers little substantive information of recommendation as such books as High Tech Start Up by Jon L. Nesheim. If its not your first book on the topic save you money. END
2,One book amongst the many in market,I had a great expectation from the book after seeing the large number of 5-star reviews. The book certainly has one-two good sections but the rest of it is just plain common sense. The book would have been better with a few more case studies and real statistics behind the arguments put forward by the author.
4,Nice dishes,I like these dishes for everyday use. The colors coordinate really nice with my decor. Work wonderful in the dishwasher and have a good weight to them.
3,My dishes,The dishes are beautiful and the kids and I love the cereal bowls (huge). The only thing I was disappointed about was that they where used. You could tell by the finish on all the bowls and plates. When it comes to dishes or kitchen wear I'ld rather have new not used.
3,Bowls crack in microwave,"We purchased this set a year ago and had been very satisfied. However, a year later we have had 3 bowls crack in the microwave. There were no chips in the bowls, they simply cracked."
2,"Loe these dishes,hate these dishes!","I love the style and color of these dishes, matches my whole house....but first time I dished stuffed cabbage from crockpot the dinner plate cracked in half right in my hand. I have had plenty of dishes in my time all could take the heat of a stuffed cabbage. Might add the crockpot had been turned off for atleast an hour. Will keep them but will not put hot food on them again. What a shame."
1,Dissapointed,"Love the look but they chip very easily, my husband picked up a cup of coffee and the cup just fell off the handle on two occasions.I guess if you have no kids and don't use every day they'd be great but they are not good for a family or daily wear and tear."
3,Product is decent,"I already had a set of this dinnerware, but needed more. The new set seems to have some flaws in it. But don't want to go through the hassle of returning."
3,Would have been higher rating yesterday,"I liked the set, it came in undamaged and as advertised. Unfortunately today I put some hot food in a bowl and it immediately cracked and I had to throw it out."
5,Great value!,"I bought this set for three times for serving 12 people! I also bought a lot of the additional to the set for my whole kitchen. Great investment! I love the feel of these dishes. Very nice smooth feel but all the bowls look slightly different, the slight inconsistancys make you feel like you have a set of hand-made set!!"
2,Faded,I'm so disappointed I just puchased 2 sets of dinner ware also salad plates. I wanted to rinse them before using them and all the glaze came off. The dishes are all dull and of course I have throw every box out never dreaming this would happen... I have waited a very long time to get new dishes and i could just cry. Think about this before you spend a lot on money on this product.. It said dishwasher safe but they aren't... My 19 year old son warmed me to test just one dish but thinking mother knows best.. What a lesson I have learned...
1,Worst set of dishes I've ever owned,"I've had these dishes for over a year. I am down to 2 bowls, 4 dessert plates, and 6 dinner plates. Even though it says you can microwave them, you can't. They actually break down the middle. I just had a dessert plate break down the middle and the only thing I did to it was put it in the dishwasher. They are the worst set of dishes I have ever owned! I will never purchase a Sango product again. It was the Sango Gold Dust."
4,Brought back childhood memories...,Our grandchildren were coming for a week stay with us and we want to introduce them to activites that we did as children and get away from the 'electronics' for a week. Our oldest who is almost 8 was very good at Tiddlywinks. He would score about 75% of the time. Love the metal tin!
3,Channel Craft TTW Tiddly Winks,"""channel craft tiddly winks in a classic toy tin"" were not in as good a quality as I was hoping for"
4,Dreaming in Cuban,"This was a very interesting book given that I was visiting Cuba while reading it. A number of references in the book would not have made much sense if I hadn't been there. I would recommend it for people interested in Cuba, interested in mystical situations, or just wanting to know more about the Cuban situation."
1,Crudely crafted vehicle doesn't run,"This is one of the most disappointing reads in years. The author may have had a good idea, examining the tensions between expatriate Cubans and those who remained behind, but it's lost amid the cardboard cut-out characters and the formulaic ""magical realism"". There are occasional glimmers of interesting imagery, but the ""story"" wanders aimlessly over the years and the members of the family appear to be pathetic (e.g., Felicia) and/or hateful (e.g., Lourdes). The author's attitude towards her characters comes across as arbitrary and random. The vignettes from Pilar's ""life"" were particularly unsatisfactory. The question arises: If the author cares so little about her characters, why should the reader care at all?"
1,Draming because this book is so bad,"When you mix soft core porn and culturly confused Cubans, you get this PIECE OF CRAP LITERATURE. I think their must have been at least 30 different sex or sex related scenes and oh so many other odd things. One example is when one of the characters (a girl) masturbates to her mother's old boyfriend's picture, imagining him going down on her...uck! The plot is so badly intwined and mixed together you want to question ever reading again! FOR THE SAKE OF LITERATURE DON'T READ THIS!"
1,Snoring in Cuban,"While trying to read this excuse for a story, I fought back yawns, and dreary eyes. The author attempts to recreate a story of a Cuban's life, but it is constantly interrupted by smaller, less relevant stories. I do not by any means recommend this novel."
5,Dearming in Cuban,"Dreaming in CubanI love Chistina Garcia. She wrote another book I reviewed here called ""The Aguerro Sisters."" That was a great book and so is this. It will not disappoint. This was the first one of the two she wrote. It has to do with life as a Cuban immigrant and her family to the U.S. and also an extended family in Miami. There are other characters as well that are captivating. The parts that take place in Cuba are frightening and supernatural. I wish that Christina Garcia would write more books."
2,Fragmented,"Disjointed segments come together to form Dreaming in Cuban. A series of letters, switches between first person and third person point of view, and an unclear ending result in a bewildered reader."
3,it was ok- what a let down,"I don't know what the big deal was for this book.I waited many years to read this book.To me what a let down.I expected much more. I lived in Miami's Cuba, so I expected more.It was soooo depressing to live in Cuba. The daughter were so different like night and day. One sister was in to Santaria,( african voodoo) that she died because of it. Another sister was in the USA, and she went to Cuba and then decided she wanted to save her nephew.It was just too outlandish. And not realistic. The end was disappointing."
1,Utter Dislike,"I have to read this book for school. I dislike it very very much. It is a torturous read. It is boring, unoriginal, unorganized and lame. I am glad to see others gave this book one star as well. Don't follow the crowd with the reviews. If you really think about it, this book is in fact pathetic. Lourdes finds that Pilar was laying in the shower ""enjoying"" the water in a journal. Oh come on! It is cliche and unrealistic. Also, Garcia's spicy, beautiful character that is in love and that likes to dance, play the piana and let her hair down is an old grandma (Celia). It doesn't make sense. And, I know this story isn't about mental disease but the author downplays alot of parts including the ones where Felicia supposedly murders her husband and other people as well."
1,Half Eaten Gift with my book,"I purchased the book used knowing that it would be partly worn, but when I opened the book not only did I find my receipt but I also found a half eaten lollipop between the pages. Now I would hope that in selling books they could take the time to at least verify whether or not there are food items within the book. I know for a fact I will never purchase books from this seller again."
2,Dreaming in Cuban sent me to la la land,"while I applaud the author for a good first time effort, getting through this book was no small task. At the beginning of the book we are introduced to several characters and soon you can't keep track of them. At some point it feels like the author lost track of the characters herself. She left a lot of loose ends,and several plot changes that just didn't make sense or went nowhere. If this book is a ""must read"" for you, ONE SUGGESTION find the quickest way to the library."
2,So So but not Great,"I bought this novel in light of the recent events in Miami relative to the Cuban American community and their views about Fidel Castro. It was an attempt to find out a little more about the political climate in Cuba and how it can divide families.Although the book was good in some parts, I found it to be written in a very disjointed manner and the story was, at times, difficult to follow. I wish that he author would have been a little more focused on where she was going and how she was going to get there. She skipped from one character to another in a fashion that I thought was annoying. Perhaps this is a novel that must be read twice in order to gain the full meaning and message. I was very disappointed."
4,Impressive....,"This novel is about Cuba, the author's native country, and 3 generations of del Pino women. They have different personalities and different philosophy for life. It is fullof memories of the four women, both past and present. I think that this book is intresting to read because the story of the novel keeps you reading it and you willh ave to understand the character and personalities by reading narratives, love letters and monologs to potray them as they move back and fourth through time."
2,Alfred's groaning is very disappointing,"No complaints about the performance and recording quality itself (see fullsome praise in all other reviews at time of writing).But no-one mentions how Alfred moans and groans and hums all the time and this is REALLY annoying in the quieter passages (take for example the opening Adagio of the Op5 No.2 on CD1:1).Also, why does the order of the works on the CDs have to be virtually random? I.e., CD 1 has Sons 2, then 4, then 3, then variations; CD 2 has variations, then 5, then 1, then more variations. Bizzare... Perhaps it was to fit it on 2 CDs, but even then the order within the CDs could have been better.Anyway, if you want a Glenn-Gould-like background from Alfred, then you will like this; otherwise, avoid..."
4,Good alternative to the manual,"I bought this book because I am new to Logic Pro and I was very much intimitated by the 2 encyclopedias of info that come with the program. I did end up reading much of the manuals anyway, and read this book after completing about 60-70% of the Logic Pro manuals. This book had basically the same info, but in a quicker, more accessible way for a newcomer. It is a great book, but if you have the patience for the included manuals, this book mostly repeats what you find in the Logic Manuals (The author, Orren Merton, even wrote some of the manuals!). Great Book if you are new to Logic, and want a middle ground between the quickstart manual and getting your doctorate in Logic Manual 101."
5,Cooking with gusto!,"This is a terrific collection of pieces covering a variety of styles but all the songs have distinct melodies which Bream brings to the front. Plus there's plenty of fast, machine gun fire passages which Bream plays with amazing clarity. Bream's style is bright, aggressive, and confident. A terrific performance."
1,There must be an easier way,This book. AAARRRGGGHH!!! It sucks. I hope you are not forced to get this like I was because you are in for a nasty suprise. Go to websites and research the material before you bang your head against the wall like I did trying to understand what the heck was going on with this book.
4,My son loves the bonus movie -- Voyage of the Unicorn,"My 8 1/2 year old loves Voyage of the Unicorn. And it's not terrible for me to sit through, either. Think along the lines of the old Chronicles of Narnia and Aliens in the Attic. Since Voyage is not always available at the library when he wants to check it out, I decided to find a copy of the DVD for a gift. I haven't seen Mysterious Island yet, but usually enjoy Patrick Stewart's work, and for the price, am happy to have the bonus movie."
2,Mysterious Island,"I though this version was not as entertaining as the original version. I would recommend buying the original. In this remake, the acting was strong and the effects were as good as the original. However, the storyline changed slightly with respect to Captain Nemo which I feel detracts from the plot and original intent."
1,SUCKY REMAKE,"A sucky remake of the 1961 classic. The black guy just ruined the movie with his contemporary attitude. I thought he was going to start rapping any minute, and start callin everybody M*****F*****.Stick to the original, a true classic,."
1,Leave it on an island!,How bad can this be? Bad. The actors are expected to make up for a lousy screenwrite. I gave the movie away to the Salvation Army. I hope they make some money off of it!
3,Buy the first one...,"I loved the original version even if it was corny. I expected an updated version to have much better special effects. This one was even cornier than the original. However, it was entertaining so I gave it a 3."
2,Not so Mysterious Island,"Many others have outlined the plot here. So I won't delve into that. As a fan of Patrick Stewart, I thought I'd give this a try. It was in the cheap DVD bin, so it wasn't a big expense. This movie is awful. I can't help but wonder if Stewart owed somebody a favor to appear in it. As pointed out, Nemo works best as a background character, but here he's front and center. He's set up nice (from a stranded on an island POV) digs. The characters seem to be just running around in the jungle, once Nemo abandons them to their fate. They encounter one cheesy special effect after another. Things are so bad that in the end, Nemo is scrambling on the deck of the Nautilus when he bumps one of the appendages on the sub, and it just topples over! Badly acted, downright monotonous at times, with lousy Grade-Z SPFX, this movie is for Jules Verne completists only."
3,Don't take this one seriously,"This is a really fun movie, though a bit long. While there are serious moments, the movie also leans heavily on satire... especially when it comes to the graphics. Some people knock the movie for that, but I think it ads realism... afterall this is a remake of a 50's(?) grade B scifi movie.Good action, decent dialog... not scary at all."
4,Mysterious island review,The dvd is in good shape. I enjoyed seeing some of my favorite actors in this Jules Verne remake.
2,Not a Review: A Question,"So, the product details say both ""Widescreen"" _and_ ""1.33:1"". From those of you who've seen it...:Which is it?"
1,Buy the old one,This movie has really bad acting. The direction is very poor. This movie is hard to sit through. The production values are poor. They cannot even show an entire balloon flying through the air. The scale of scenery does not make sense. Seems like a very cheap remake. Just buy the old one.Mysterious Island (1961) (Ws)
1,Do NOT buy this trumpet,We purchased this trumpet last August. By the end of September the plating on the valves wore off and a local music store said that it could not be repaired because the metal was of such inferior quality that new plating would not adhere to it. Neither Cecilio or Austin Bazaar will take the trumpet back even though it's useless. Don't buy it. It's a piece of junk.
3,"very Good info, not very funny though","If you were expecting Loretta Laroche for humor, she's not that funny, however the info she shares is very good, and she is believable. I liked the motivation of the tape."
2,Not what I expected...,The book is like a technical report and is quite dull reading. Much of it is simply reporting on what psychologists from the early to mid 20th century have thought about humor with little original input. Many references were from Freud and his contemporaries. Many facets and types of humor are described but never coalescence into a comprehensive theory of humor.
3,Very comprehensive but too academic,"I'm happy with amount of information covered and the index is excellent!As a professional practitioner I would prefer to see more emphasis on practical applications and less on theory and proofs.I get more use out of the Weibull handbook, which is the opposite. It is very focused on the practitioner but the index is not as useful and it has minimal theory.The pair of them are excellent. If I could only have 1 then as a student I'd buy this book but as a practitioner I'd by the Weibull Handbook."
2,Not woth the cost,"These must be the short stories no one else wanted to publish, and with good reason."
5,"Earth, Wind, & Fire (The Collection) music DVD","track listings:(video clips) serpentine fire, boogie wonderland, september, let me talk, let's groove, magnetic, fall in love with me, system of survival & thinking of you.(live tracks) fantasy, reasons, sing a song, i've had enough, & after the love has gone.I rated this music DVD a 5 (EXCELLENT)."
2,Music was great the constant motion & filming tricks just drove us nuts,Music was O.K. filiming was just too much. almost unbareable. We listen to the DVD while we clean house because it looks like a drug party gone wrong. Constant film tricks and loud colors destroy the great music and talent musicians. We wasted money.
3,It was an okay book.,"I am a huge simpsons fan, and I probably have seen every episode yet, but this book was a little bit of a disapointment. It is obvious that it isn't one of Matt Groening's greatest books. I would recommend a diiferent one for anyone who wants to find out about the Simpsons and is just starting out. For anyone who needs extra information to fill their appetite for Simpsons mania, it would be okay. Still, its not exactly the most entertaining and humorous book written by this author. ""Bart's Guide to Life"" + ""Guide to the Simpsons"" + ""The Simpsons Uncensored Family Album"" are better books if your looking for a great book. In conclusion, unless you are a Simpsons fanatic, one who needs every bit of information that they can grab onto, don't go buying it."
3,"Good, but not too good","This book is not as interesting and amusing as the other Simpsons books such as ""A complete guide to our favorite family"" and ""Bart Simpson's guide to life"". Don't expect it to contain a lot of new information about the Simpsons. Most of the stuffs in there are already known, and if not known, are not worth knowing(unless you want to know every little bit of detail and uninteresting facts about the Simpsons)."
5,This book is awesome reference for The Simpsons!!!!!,"This book is reference to the town of Springfield (fictionally) and it rocks!!!!! This book is especially good reference for people who own the CD-ROM game, Virtual Springfield."
1,WORST BOOK EVER,"As a huge fan of the simpsons, i got this booking believing it would be entertaining, not for simpsons information. This is one of the most boring books I have ever read. Well, that isn't true because I returned it after reading about 40 pages. Save yourself some money and buy Bart Simpsons Guide to Life or a different book. In the words of the Comic Book Guy, ""WORST BOOK EVER"""
4,I wanna go to Springfield now!,"My brother and his fiancee got this for me a couple of years ago, and I loved it. It included obscure characters, and the guide was brilliant. I liked to choose places to go to if I could've gone to Springfield, where to eat, which hotel to go to(Aphrodite) and on top of all that, which festivals to go to. I liked the survival guide, although I was annoyed at the complete exaggeration of Sideshow Bob's character. I guess it's inevitable for all cartoon villains to be portrayed by that though.Still, go through Springfield second-hand with this guide! It will seem first-hand, meeting all the characters, and hanging out in the coolest places!"
5,Very impressive and detailed,"I thought this book would take a superficial look at Springfield but it went into great detail which complemented the TV series. I wish the book did not end - hopefully there will be a follow in the ""Are We There Yet?"" series of books."
5,Generally excellent radio transcriptions...,"Doris Day sizzles a top of The Page Cavanaugh Trio on ""Just You, Just Me."" Isn't it funny how her recordings for Columbia had those corny arrangemnts and terrible background singers, yet these never commercially released sides with a red hot jazz trio(Page Cavanaugh Trio) are among her best 50's recorded material(aside from two excellent Columbia 50's soundtracks ""Love Me or Leave Me"" and ""Young Man With A Horn.""). These tracks are generally excellent sessions recorded for radio transcriptions, Day is also backed by a swingin' group led by Van Alexander(often Kay Starr's arranger, for her jazzier stuff like ""Movin' With Kay.""). This same material is available in other CD packages as well, it's good music, that shows Doris Day can handle straight ahead jazz on the same level as Sarah Vaughan, or Chris Connor. Recommended"
3,Good...but could be better,"This sprayer certainly is good but could be much better with only minor changes. The hose leaks where it connects to the hand wand which means you get herbicide all over your hand when you use it. Secondly, the pump arm holes do not align up properly so that you can get the bolt through the assembly. Frustrating! Otherwise, not a bad sprayer."
2,Explain this to a Doctor!,"This book is a complete waste of time!...Well not unless you're a med student reviewing for your finals. This book does not give any tips on modern or contemporary competition shooting other than the obvious such as the importance of maintaining balance, breathing, etc. This book is very very slow paced and all explanations and discussions are deeply medical in nature. I would strongly advise the readers to have a doctor on stand by for consultation on the medical terms used EXCESSIVELY in this book.Last three words: NOT WORTH IT!"
1,Elementary! My Dear Watson!,"This book is titled ELEMENTARY Differential Equations with Linear Algebra. The information in the book figures you've know a good deal about differentials and if you don't, you'll be lost. The book seems to skim over things quickly, give very easy samples and difficult questions. Not only this, but the author brings the information across to the reader in a boring and at times abstract detail. I found myself thoroughly disgusted about differentials applications altogher after briefly going through this book. If I could give this book a -1, I would.Getting back to the title, the only thing elementary about this textbook is the preface. If you have this book for your course in college, you may want to skip this book and just xerox the questions. There really aren't many per chapter. END"
1,Horrible textbook,unlike other text books I have read so far... this one is the most difficult to understand and provide very little detail on the examples.do not recommend this but it is the required text for my math class... I will not do good because of this..

1,Extremely poor !! Very Very bad !!!,"This book just show very easy example and give extremely hard(even impossible) exercises to solve, the solutions are very short or practically nonexistant . This book is written in a very unprofessionnal manner , the author does not care about who reads his book and assume that everybody is a genious , if you're a teacher and want to adopt this in your college you'll run in a lot of complaints from your students .I really had a nigthmare studting this book, all i learnt from this book is to hate it!!!This book should be burned and removed from circulation !!!!"
1,Not worth your money.,This book doesn't explain s***! It's the worse math book out there. To many theorems and not to many problems. Look for another ODE & Linear Algebra book if you can.
1,just about worst math book i have used,I used this for a introductory differential equations course. All the reviewers are dead on. This book will make you hate math with a passion such as you have never known.
1,Hard to Learn From,"This book is very difficult to learn from, the examples are hard to follow, the ideas that are relatively simple are portrayed in such a way that they are confusing. The basic ideas on differential equations that are portrayed in the first chapter are manageable but as the book goes on, it gets more and more horrible. I would not recommend this as a teaching tool or as a supplemental reading aid. I am currently studying this subject and I, along with all of my classmates that i am acquainted with, dislike this book strongly and believe that it is a waste of money. I have had to buy additional textbooks to understand this subject"
1,The worst textbook I have used,"This book is truly awful. The examples are nearly all theoretical and difficult to follow. They do not cover any cases beyond the most basic. Anything I have learned about Linear Algebra or Differential Equations has been from alternate sources. Unfortunately, my professor assigns problems from this book so I am forced to keep it for the problems. In the 40-50 textbooks I have used, 20-25 of which math or engineering courses, this has been the least helpful and more unclear than anything I have ever used."
1,Terrible! Very abstract without Explainations,"I agree with the other reviewers of this book. It is one of the worst Math books around. The explanations are very few and far between as well as being abstract. This isn't a good book for an introduction to Differential Equations. It should be called the ""Previously Knowledge Assumed"" Book. I think that the author takes for granted that people will be able to follow his thought process without the steps or assumptions or definitions.Avoid this book. It is very poor. I would have given it 0 stars if I could."
2,Misleading,I purchased this product and was very disappointed when I opened the package. The discription of the ramikens that comes with the torch are very little. The dimensions that are given are way beyond correct.
5,Wonderful blank book/journal,"Besides the beautiful picture on the cover, these hand-stitched versions are the easiest I've found to write in because they actually lay flat so you can write! They don't seem fragile just because the binding is visible, and it's very unique looking. The pages are very yellow-ish, which I don't mind, but if you only like pure white, you may want to know. Wide spaced lines. They don't have quite as many pages as some other traditionally bound blank journals at comparable prices. But I think they are beautiful for a special blank book you may want for something."
3,love the pen but slippery grip,"Loved everything about the pen - price, looks, etc. Just a very slippery grip (I really like a knurled type grip on everything I write with)."
5,A great act of kindness,"Reading treasured misfortunes is deep poetry that made me become in need to look inside my heart and evaluate the real meaning of life. I respected the poet for sharing such experience with people, helping the Spina Bifida Association is a good way for me to know more about the poet human values which made me tell few of my friends about the book which i read more than once.Treasured Misfortunes is a very good book to read. I thank Amazon.com for giving the people the chance to put their thoughts of the book on their site. Sammer Thanks"
5,Excellent Book,"Sammer Congratulations on a job well done.I was not surprised when your book was given to me as a gift from my sister. I always enjoyed reading your other books such as ""Who Would Know"". Your POETRY is a treasure for those who really care about humanity. Sammer you always been recognized for your touching poetry,and expressive art.Good job."
5,The best poetry book I have ever read,"Yes I did read this great poetry book of an absolute vision of hope to many people who are suffering and lingering for the chance to dream of a better day. A better health condition for those who we love so dearly.Treasured Misfortunes is the best book i was able to bring to my book club this month.our group is about 37 people,who love to read and discuss a good book.We all thank Amazon for making our reviews to be recognized.This book really deserves a great AWARD,for the greatest values in life it upholds THE REAL TRUE LOVE THAT IS UNCONDITIONAL for those who are struggling to survive their tragic birth defects."
5,Spiritual,"I read Treasured Misfortune at my most desperate time for comfort.I could not let the book out of my hands,once i began to read it.The book is all real emotions that reflect on the reality of all the parents who have experienced such a painful ordeal in life.The book helped me so much to deal with all my feelings of fear,and to understand that i am not alone.The poetry is so strong,so deep,that it left me with the great spirits of acceptance of my child health condition.Sammer you are a great poet,and a great human being,and a great mom who encourage people to enjoy the best of God creation.Thanks.I love the book and i wish everyone would purchase Treasured Misfortunes book.It is a great book."
5,Words of wisdom,"Treasured Misfortunes is a great book. I felt the joy of its spirits touch my soul. I purchased the book at the SPINA BIFIDA ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA ANNUAL CONFERENCE that took place in MILWAUKEE,WI. I have a son who have Spina Bifida,reading the poetry just hit home in a positive way.I felt great that i also had the wonderful chance to meet with the author of the book Sammer Ghouleh. I asked her many questions,she had the best healing answers i ever heard.Thanks Sammer,keep up the good work.People like me really appreciate it.Good Luck"
5,The Lakota lose their last warrior,"Terry has again transported us back in time to the the last days of the powerful Ogalala warrior who finally came in to the Red Cloud agency to fight the white man no more. This book goes into detail to the conspiring factions of the Sioux leaders and the local U.S. Army commanders in bringing down the famous warrior. Terry paints the story with sights and sounds of the the capture and tragic death of Crazy Horse. The author can instill life into his characters with great passion that lets the reader have great empathy with the situations that they must go through. If you want to get hooked on history of the Old West, I recommend this book and the thirty some other books he has written. Good bye Terry. I was proud to have known and rode with you."
4,Lovely,"Very pretty ring. To me, this is obviously CZ, but who cares? Still looks great on! Quite pleased."
3,Disappointed a bit,"I remember swooning when I saw Charlotte's ring on the show - this one's kind of small but it is beautiful - I just thought it would come with a little more ooomph - it looks very regular to me, not what I expected. It's nice though - just don't expect too much, no one's gonna be shocked to see it on your finger."
1,Very disappointing,"This ring is really pretty but, the first time I wore it a small stone fell out of the side. I only had it on a few hours!!!"
4,Porn legend Jack Wrangler tells all,"The adonis of 1970's gay porn, Jack Wrangler was the first adult film star to write his memoirs. Although he occasionally appeared in straight films and was doing them exclusively by 1984, this book concentrates more on his gay lifestyle and his awkward sexual relationship with 1940's singer Margaret Whiting, who later became his wife. An insightful look into 1970's porn, when sex was freer and safer."
4,Better than you'd think,"Wrangler was a child star on stage and in wholesome television productions. Very connected to the industry, he drifted, cashed in on his looks and lifestyle and became one the first real gay pornstars. His stories about making these films are often funny and always interesting. (think body makeup and hot lights!) Covers his life through his bizarre partnership with Margaret Whiting and his bid to be legit in theater. Does not include, however, more recent days when he sued NYC for a sidewalk accident that left him unable to perform his manly duties for Whiting! All in all, though, a good read."
4,Homage to a Musical Genius,"Ms. Crosby's body of work is out of style now, but for those of us raised in Protestant churches a half century ago, the work still lives. This CD could've had more of the literally dozens of hymns she produced, but this is a very good sampler. I would have preferred listening to these in a choral context, but Mr. Hamilton presents a good and honest rendering of these songs. I appreciate his effort, and recommend the CD."
1,Turning Fanny Crosby's Hymns into Bombs,"Fanny Crosby was certainly one of the most prolific writer of gospel songs and hymns the world has ever known. There are many of them in church hymnals today. Unfortunately, this CD turns Miss Crosby's hymns into twangy, hillbilly ditties that I had very little patience to listen to. I would suggest that others who want to hear the old gospel hymns find them in another venue, because this CD---pardon the expression---smells."
5,[....],alpha do not disappoint on their second full length album. less jazz but more atmosphere fill the tracks of this one... exquisite: thank you alpha.
2,Less than I expected.,I read through it and found the tone of writing a tad condescending. I deleted it. Perhaps it was my mood at the time.
5,Zat Cat,"I loved it-the colorful and beautiful illustrations, the funny and exciting story, particularily the ""French"". Etoile is a wonderful, mischievous cat. A book in rhyme is great to read aloud."
1,"Where are the ""Unleashing"" techniques?","Interesting subject but I was anxiously awaiting with every chapter the how-to methods of reprogramming the mind. They never came! Each chapter repeated over and over again what the author discovered from his experiments as I became more and more bored! The sub-title of the book is ""Unleashing the Power of Consciousness"" and is misleading since it implies the book will show you how. On the last page of the addendum it gives a web address to visit for techniques. The website advertises a $22 book but pretty much tells you the book won't help you - only an expensive workshop will. These 2 authors don't want to help people, they want to make money!"
2,"Enlightening to a degree, but disappointing.","I bought this book because I was under the impression it had to do with ""unleashing the power of consciousness, matter and miracles"" achieved through your beliefs. Page after page, chapter after chapter I'm thinking...""When do we get to the part about how to change our beliefs?"" All kinds of data regarding how cells work, a smidgen about how early childhood programming effects us through our sub-conscious. A little bit about how we are all one, sprinkled with a little spirituality. Well, thank God for the ""Addendum"" starting on pg 203 where you are directed to Rob Williams' ""Psych-K"" as the means for meaningful change, otherwise this book was nothing more than a personal dissertation regarding ""the Biology of Cells."" I feel the title of the book is highly mis-leading."
3,"Interesting, but not ""Life-Changing""","The bit about changing your own subconscious negative behaviors into good ones is a sham. This book does NOT tell you how to do it. It hints that it will, but at the end the advice is to attend a PSYCH-K seminar...which costs about [...] bucks.So the secret of life is: Send me five hundred dollars and I'll tell you."
2,Two Chapters Too Short,"If you are looking for answers on how to improve your life, don't waste your money. The author starts off by telling you how he turned his life around by changing his beliefs. The chapters explain the science very cleary and in layman's terms - it is all very interesting. Just when you are ready to turn the page to find out the author's secrets, the book is ending !!! The author doesn't explain what he did to resolve issues in his own life and does not explain how you can do it in yours. He only refers you to his friend's book which, if you read the reviews on that one, is just an infomercial for an expensive seminar they both teach !!!! Unless you are a scientist, you will not find this book helpful."
3,"Radical and Interesting, though questionably scientific","As a reader well-versed in What the Bleep, Abraham-Hicks, and Candace Pert's excellent Molecules of Emotion (which I found more scientific); I am comfortable with new-age medical concepts. However, Lipton's boldest statement is that you can completely overcome genetics. While I don't believe one is doomed by their genetics, I think the other extreme is to say you can completely ""rewire"" them. Research regarding human's having a ""Happiness Set-Point"" would indicate that reality is somewhere in the middle. I agree that our choices can work with, or against, our genetics; but to state we can reinvent them...It's a radical, interesting book; though I didn't experience it completely as a medically scientific one."
2,"The Biology of Belief: Unleashing the power of consciousness, matter and Miracles","This book is a real disappointment. The title itself promises that the reader will gain new understanding of how one's subconsious rules behavior and how to rewrite the programing. It gives a very detailed description of how cells work and how they react to enviornment which early on holds out the bright promise of understanding how to change those reactions. However, the end of the book was a cheep sell out to refer the reader to the workshops presented by the writer and his partner, to the tune of $400 each. (it seems you really need two or three of them to rewrite your programing according to the web site to which the book refers the reader). As far as I can tell from the web site, it is just more worthless new age hype. Sorry I spent my money on this book."
2,A little disappointing,"I made my way throught the whole book waiting for the chapter that would tell me how to put all this into practice....it never came. Instead what I got was a page that has his 3 CDs for sale and a website for Psych-K that offered to tell me how to do it if I spent a lot of money. Seems to me if Mr. Lipton was truly concerned about the future of humanity, this information would be given freely with an open heart. That in itself makes me suspicious of his motives. But then again, I'm sure I already know his motive: $$$.Also, this book could have been less than 100 pages long and still gotten across all of the relevant science he presents."
3,A Prelude to Law of Attraction,"If someone had never read Law of Attraction, or Frequency, then this would seem groundbreaking information...but it is tucked in between so much of Mr. Lipton's personal story - all the minutae of his childhood... that I started itching to jump out of my skin... I already know this stuff from other readings... where's the beef? Get on with it already. It took too long to get the point!The best book I've read recently is 'Frequency' - it is one of the most fascinating reads - but don't start it until AFTER you've had plenty of Abraham teachings under your belt... deep stuff."
4,The Biology of Belief,"1. The science about 'belief' was explained in an easy-to-understand style. I greatly appreciated the information and knowledge that I gained from this book. I bought this book because I wanted to understand how my beliefs affect my body and my life in this world.2. The story was told in a way that kept me wanting to read the next page, much like a good mystery story; in other words, Dr. Lipton kept the interest level high throughout his book.3. The book was very, very positive and encouraging.4. Alas, I was disappointed that the PSYCH-K change techniques talked about in the Addendum were not described in this book; perhaps in a future book???Thank you Dr. Lipton!"
5,Biology of Belief,"I am so happy that Bruce Lipton speaks out what others only presume might be true. To me what I know about his work serves as a foundation for my work on the importance of a Sense of Self for personal health, happiness and success but also as a contribution to world peace. I am not a very technical person but the way Doctor Bruce Lipton explains with the help of visual aids what the basis is of all life is very helpful and revealing. His enthusiasm is refreshing and shows that he really cares about his subject. He is curious and smart and that is why it is easy to truly relate to what his findings are."
4,Interesting to learn how cells are controlled by environment,I have been on a personal quest for understanding about how cells function and the role of emotion in healthy cells. This book expanded my understanding and I came away with a deeper knowledge (as a layperson) about cellular biology and the roll of emotions. I really liked the new way I think about the body as a community if cells and each one like a little individual person. Very helpful ideas he expressed. Wish he had looked at application of these ideas and wrote more about the current research to back these findings up.
5,The Biology of Belief,"I heard Bruce Lipton in Canada and was spell bound by his presentation and his message. I read his book and now have a completely new understanding about how we influence our body and our health and our genes. Awesome, challenging!"
1,"NO APPLICABLE CONTENT OR EXERCISES, WAY TOO SCIENTIFIC","You are not ""unleashing the power of consciousness, matter and miracles""...you are taking a post grad biology course. 3 DISCS ABOUT evolution, chromosomes, cells, energy, matter - truly a science class on what comprises humans.Way too scientific with almost ZERO instruction on using the mind and consciousness. Informative SCIENTIFIC information but a very misleading title - nothing applicable to everyday life nor does it even attempt to teach you HOW TO practice or apply anything. Just hours and hours of scholastics.Deeply disappointing."
4,The connection between mind and body,"If you want to understand the connection between mind and body; how a thought can influence the cells, then this book has the answer. Dr. Lipton's work explains the missing link in the mind.body paradigm.You Don't have To Die When Your Doctor Says: A practical guide to living with grace and joy in the face of a terminal prognosis."
5,William Fearn,The book was in perfect condition. It was delivered in a timely manner. The book was as described.
4,"The Biologyof Belief: Unleashing the power of Consciousness, Matter and Miracles","Great information and insights of cellular biology from a Ph.D in the field. Doug's life experiences were not key to his development of this theory, but they were fun reading in the midst of biological information. I truly enjoyed the work and his processing in a way that is of value to all readers, New Agers, seekers of truth and scientists."
1,Bring it to mainstreat with proper peer review and proof,"You can have your spiritual beliefs, but please keep your scalpals to yourselves until your methods are propoerly peeer reviewed and adequately proven."
2,A Course in Biology,"This Book seems more like a Biology text book. Mr. Lipton uses a lot of scientific terms, making the book not only hard to read (for non-biologists) but also boring. For most of the scientific terms used, he does not provide an explanation. The long title of the book does not agess with its contents. It does not get to the point. The author takes a lot of space just teeling about himself than anything else. I think a more simple language (language for the average person) would make this book fascinating."
5,Inspirational clarity,"It happens on occasion that I cannot put a book down. It was thus with Bruce Lipton's gem. As a non-scientist I found the 'mystery' of cellular biology so accessible and so easy to understand. [No wonder his Carribean students excelled!!] His clarity of mind and expression are a delight, and the manner in which the book unfolded was a joy for me. To have the connection to the Universe/God/ All-That-Is illustrated so clearly is truly inspirational and in the end - so simple. Wonderful stuff. Thank you so much Bruce Lipton"
3,A work in progress,"The revelations regarding epigenetics were exciting.The book is brief regarding ""belief""; as if that portion was ""a work in progress"". As is, it is a call to faith in a something/someone out there that ""communicates"" through the essence of our cells."
2,Interesting but...,"I thought this book would be about how people form beliefs from a biological point of view.While I did like a lot of his non spiritual ideas, his criticism of darwin / darwinians is unfounded as darwin fully explained how important environment is in evolution if you actually read ""on the origin of species"", and darwin knew nothing of genes or DNA so why slam darwinian evolution ? because it doesn't need a creator or spiritualism."
5,Biology of Belief Review,"My order came as promised. I am really looking forward to reading this book, the reviews have been great and I have heard great things about it."
4,The Biology of Belief,I thought it was an unabridged version of the book... which it does not appear to be.
1,Complete Quackery,This is just another natureopath/alternative medicine quack using pseudoscience and an incredibly bad understanding of basic quantum mechanical principles to justify his views on alternative medicine. Energy healing is discredited bunk as is every other practice in this book. Save your money and go see a real doctor.
2,THE BIOLOGY OF BELIEF,"I was attracted to this book by the title. However, I find the book too technical too really understand the message the author is intending. For me, a lot of the words I do not know how to pronounce and do not know what they mean and this prevents me from understanding the message of the book. Anyone with a background similar to the author will no doubt totally enjoy the book."
4,Thought provoking,"Whether you agree or disagree with what Dr. Lipton says this book is incredibly important. He bridges new discoveries with a new way of thinking about our minds and bodies. Unfortunately radically new ideas tend to be subject of much ridicule when first presented, however I'm convinced. Quantum physics has forced us to think different, and this is exactly what Dr. Lipton has done. Pick this book up and decide for yourself."
4,A Challenging Message of Hope,"The challenge of Biology of Belief is for the entirely non-technically educated person. The author makes strong effort to bridge between scientists and lay people with fair success. For those who persist, the messages of the book fall into two areas.1. Darwin may have given us our vocabulary and basic concepts about the interrelationships between competing organisms, but he doesn't have the final word. The author is a cell biologist with impressive credentials. His challenge to the ""survival of the fittest"" dogma is startling and interesting.2. Linton's idea that there are significant other factors shaping our experience and survival beside genetic. He makes a pursuasive case that what we believe is what we experience."
5,Definitive Source on the Power of Belief,"Finally! Bruce Lipton's book is the definitive biological confirmation that energy is the true source of healing, and that our thoughts do, indeed, create reality. Lipton's illustrations are excellent, creating the visuals necessary to relate to his detailed scientific material. His stunning research breaks the bonds of traditional approaches to how the body gets sick and how the body can heal."
1,Save your money,"Save your money! I bought this through Kindle so I didn't even pay full price for it, thankfully! The first 5 chapters of this 7 chapter book was mostly scientific biology which didn't interest me at all and was able to skip most of it without missing much. I thought I was getting to the heart of the book and was finally going to get some answers to find out that there aren't any answers...anywhere. I was looking for something that would guide me into changing my way of thinking, things to practice. No luck - not here. In the Addendum he references PSYCH-K with Rob Williams which was basically a plug for you to attend one of their seminars. UG!! A waste of money and time! I'd give this book zero stars if I could."
4,Good Choice,This book fulfilled all of my expectations and more.I am very pleased that I purchased this book. I feel that this book enriched my life.
2,"Biology of ""Stretching the facts to support"" belief","I have no medical background so I skipped through much of the technical aspects, but I'll just add one more thing in case someone catches this: Lipton holds seminars which actively engage the audience in use of kinesthesiology to ""speak to the subconscious,"" the methods used in this seminar are far from scientific, more like the regular pseudo-science bull crap. I believed his ""scientific"" background until I saw the video. Any true scientist has to question the validity of his experiments, and he did not in this case. However, some theories are entertaining at the least, and the whole book is not at a loss."
2,Biology of Blief (NOT),"""Biology of Belief"" lives up to the promise of interesting biology but not the promise that it would have anything meaningful to add to the question of belief. At least author Bruce Lipton has the good grace to confine his ""belief"" nonsense to an epilogue rather than elevate it to the level of the scientifically interesting material by including it as an actual chapter. I would have realized the title was misleading if had paid attention to the subtitle ""Unleashing the Power of Consciousness, Matter and Miracles."" What was I thinking???"
1,Book based on limited knowledge,"I wish that authors who have epiphanies read classic books first. Hundreds of the eastern sources (some are 1000 years old) are talking about the effect of the mental state on the state of our health whith more practical advise, solid theory and less pomp.I was expecting more new scientific evidences. Well..... :-(Would not recommend it to my students"
4,Biology of Belief,Excellent. Well written and very understandable in some of the more technical aspects. I believe this is state-of-the-science information and very forward looking.
1,Not helpful,"If you want to learn the biology of a cell, this is a wonderful book, well written for that purpose. HOWEVER, if you want to learn how to use this information to help YOURSELF ""unleash the power of consciousness"", you will be extremely disappointed. At one point the author assures us he will provide that information in Chapter 7, However, in Chapter 7, he only tells you to give your children positive reinforcement - something we have all known for decades now. At the end of the book, he finally admits that positive thinking does not change your subconscious, and refers us to something called Psych-K for that. After reading the entire book, I did NOT receive the information promised in the Title."
5,still reading it but fiind it very good,I'm still readin git but find it very informative. A little more science than I need but still would reccomend it.
2,Poorly recorded,"I ordered The Biology of Belief based on the reviews I had read, but I ordered the book on C.D. since I have a 45 minute drive each way to work and quite frequently listen to books on C.D. I found the author very difficult to listen to since he quite often pauses in mid sentence, starts to say one word and then changes to another, and repeats the same phrases so often then it gets really annoying. I don't really need to hear ""This is really interesting because of this,"" 100 times. The content of the C.D. is somewhat interesting although the author gives certain names to biologocal functions to steer the conversation his way, like calling the bodies response to outside stimulae ""perception."" There is also a lot of re-stating the same thing over and over again without presenting any new idea. After listening to the C.D. I read that the C.D is ""an original adaptation"" of the book. I would have preferred a professional reading the actual book."
5,Must Read,"This book is a must-read for everyone. Finally, a scientitst has taken the leap to let people in on the new biology. The world is so needy for major transformation in thought and practice. It can only come from the transformation of each individual. As a chiropractor, I share with my patients how healing comes from within. Now, I can recommend a book that makes the biology clear to them in a totally understandable fashion."
1,Insufferably Long Ego Trip,"While completely disrespecting scientists who actually use the scientific method to prove their hypotheses, Bruce Lipton makes wild and ridiculous claims with no evidence. He does a silly tap dance of overreaching logic to reach his conclusions, but even someone with a basic grasp of science could recognize him for the charlatan that he is. Don't waste your money unless you want to hear Lipton's endless and embarrassing ego trip."
1,Incomprehensable gobbledygook,"The subject of beliefs and their effects on our mind body is certainly worthy of exploration and I had hoped The Biology of Belief would offer some useful insights. I had heard Dr Lipton speak on the subject and never quite got what was talking about. I really wanted to like this book. Instead I found it a monumental chore as I dragged myself from sentence to sentence trying to understand the scientific jargon he uses to explain his concepts. He is well respected in his field but I found this book to be wholly lacking in any kind of takeaway of practical, applicable value, pedantic in the extreme. There are somehints at useful information and they could all have been written in plain Englishon about 20 pages. I never made it to the end, just an unbearable grind all the way."
1,Im falling asleep listening to this in audio version...,"I have read tons of Quantum books and all I can say is this guy is so boring I am falling asleep after 45 min of listening to him rant on. If I make it thru this audio book and he throws out a brilliant finding, I will let you know. Either way, you better be ready for 45 minutes of absolutely nothing but how the church controlled what was allowed to be called scientific for years. OMG! zzzzzzzz....."
2,The Biology of Belief,"While well intended, this book was recommended to me by my alternative medicine Doctor. He overestimated my intelectual capacity! It is much too deep for my though processes. I can, however, see how some very deep thinkers could find this book deeply stimulating and challenging to the status quo thinking of the medical world was well as other sciences.My warning, don't buy unless you are a deep thinker who enjoys esoteric writings."
2,sub-title misleading--offers NO tips for unleahshing anything.,"Although interesting, even fascinating at moments, a non-scientist reader has to read through chapter after chapter of too much, too detailed scientific jargon, anxiously waiting to get to ""the point""...and how this applies to changing lives. Around Chapter 4 Mr Lipton eludes to the fact that he is going to get to it, but frustrating to the reader, never does!So much potential to truly change lives, but comes up disappointing. Not worth the price."
3,Stimulating but not entirely credible,"I just finished it and found it was enlightening to an extent, but got hung up on page 102 where he completely mistated the famous Einstein formula E=mc2. It you can't even get that right, you might have a problem with other fundemental items."
5,"What I had always wondered about cellular life, now proven","anyone who comes into the Joe Rogan experience podcast studio to talk The Biology of Belief about cellular biology, to documented cases of extreme groups of people being able to accomplish incredible feats for survival and most importantly through the belief system that is within us all the mainstream science community is going to have a hard to accepting most of this mainly because they need money almost all think alike, and have huge ego's, but we cant let them stifle me and you at least, and the non-believers. READ it!"
5,Biology of Belief,"This book is actually really well written and filled with valid science. While I didn't agree with every conclusion drawn, the core idea was sound. The book is written so that anyone might understand it, which makes it good for sharing, but honestly, I would have preferred standard scientific language. I did appreciate all of the citations! I highly recommend it, whether to enhance one's own scientific philosophy or just to consider something outside the box. It's sort of an armchair survey of epigenetics with theory applied to many areas of life."
3,Many Chapters Could Be Removed,"Although the book is a very useful topic, the fisrt several chapters could be reduced down to about 20 pages of information and the last chapter of the book could be removed completely. If you want to plod through all the idealogy in this book, you can get some useful information from it."
5,I wish I had a Cell Bio Lecturer Like This,Excellently written in and easy to understand style. Fantastic book that links the science to the spirit.
2,Light Treatment of Heavy Topic,"This is light reading about a topic that needs serious review. Too much info about the author's mid-life crisis and life in the Carribean and not enough about the science of cell biology. Some folks may enjoy it, but personally I was hoping for something more scientific. If this subject is important to you, then this is probably not the right book."
1,Using science as a springboard for a leap of faith,"I casually bought this book assuming it was based on science...what a mistake!!! The author uses terms such as ""energy"" in the loosest and most irresponsible way...He draws lines where in reality there are none, in order to equate ""wave"" and ""quantum"" energy to mean the ""healing energy"" in some alternative medicine therapies. He further equates quantum physics to ""mysterious"" and ""unexplained"" paranormal phenomena...not to mention debunked and unverified phenomena! But the efficacy of alternative healing is not even questioned in this book-it is presented as effective and unresearched. The author expects the reader to make a leap of faith-if you accept quantum physics, then you must also accept alternative healing- based soley on the misuse of terms. What a joke!"
4,text book like ... sound message,"This book was required reading when I was working with a life coach ... not sure I would have read it otherwise. The message is sound and I had no problem buying into it. My belief has always been that the mind/brain is a computer and what goes in is what come out. If you believe it - it will happen. Text book style as it lacks story telling, however the message is sound. Definately worth reading."
3,"Need More ""How to"" Manage Beliefs","Although Biology of Beliefs gives us some good ideas, and its premises seem valid, I was still looking for more about ""how to"" manage beliefs. On the other hand, Anatomy of Success by Ronald A Kaufman does a very good job of providing the next step towards understanding how we can change limiting beliefs to empowering ones. I recommend Anatomy of Success frequently to my clients and use the techniques suggested by Mr. Kaufman in my work as a coach on a regular basis.Elle OliverCareer Coach"
4,food for thought,A required book for class. I am now intrigued by this authors well presented idea on how things work and how interconnected we are.
4,Enlightening,I couldn't put this book down. I found it informative in an understandable way. It shares scientific knowledge that helps personal freedom which I find very exciting reading.I would have liked a bit more information about the personal techniques the author used himself for his own freedom journey but then maybe that is copyright information belonging to someone else.
1,Don't believe the subtitle!,"This book does not attempt to unleash the power of anything.To save you some time & money - the author believe cells are like computer chips, which can be programmed. End of story.In 10 years maybe the author will write a book about how we can systematically use this property of cells to improve our lives - but this is NOT that book.Eric Winter"
1,Read this if you like Scientology,"That was a couple hours of my life I will never get back. A bunch of Blah, blah, blah about his time teaching in the Caribean, and his epipheny that cells have memory, and absorb energy at a quantum level. Ok, far reaching but we'll go with it. Then comes the addendum: you can unleash the power of your subconscious simply by taking all these ""psych-k"" courses for a few thousand bucks. There are multiple levels, beginner, advanced, etc. Each one costing more money. All he needs is an e-meter and tax exempt status to complete things."
5,Biology of Belief,"Bruce Lipton is an amazing presenter and has finally actualized his lectures into a book that can more effectively reach a vast number of people. If you've seen the movie ""What the Bleep Do We Know,"" you'll want to read this book. Bruce was interviewed extensively for the movie and much of the info in the movie will be expanded upon in the book. Bruce comprehensively explains through a wonderfully understandable version of biology how each individual has the ability to control the quality and experiences of his/her life."
3,Read Far Too Fast!,"When I opened the package, I was surprised to see only 3 CDs. However, after listening I understand. It's like listening to legaleze at the end of a car commercial. Really fast. Frankly, I'm surprised Sounds True released this. While the content is superb, the author reads the book so fast that if you cut the speed in half, it would still be too fast. It requires you pay very close attention, because if you blink you've missed an important piece of the audio. I drift for a minute and have to rewind half a chapter. Like I said, the content is truly excellent, I just wish the audio was read much slower."
1,Glad I Downloaded the Kindle Sample,"This is one of those occasions that I'm glad I downloaded the Kindle sample instead of making a purchase based on the publisher's/author's description. As an anthropologist, I was hoping for a scientific review of recent neurological and psychological advances in understanding the ways in which people come to believe things like religion or superstition or engage in behaviors that range from ritualistic habits of baseball players to OCD. Instead, Lipton seems to embrace irrational belief rather than explore it; adopting pseudoscience rather than science. His derision of evidence-based medicine in the introduction and first chapter are also disappointing. If you're looking for an actual exploration of the biology of belief, it probably isn't this text. On the other hand, if you're looking for confirmation of belief..."
5,mind-openning,"This was extremely well written and is easy for the lay person to understand, but does not patronize or talk down to you. I am a massage therapist and have been into alternative healing and on a spiritual quest for years. My husband, a PhD, on the other hand is a scientist, and is agnostic. He is a retired reseach physicist, but as a hobby has studied genetics and evolution. I gave him the book to read after I had finished it and he also found it extremely profound. It has been the closest thing to bringing our beliefs to be on a the same page. Highly recommended!"
2,Biology 101,"Lipton's study of the human cell and the connection with belief looked like a good read so I purchased it. After reading it, I found it to be nothing more than a biology lesson on the human cell and a Bio. You will get more out of reading books by A.Robins, N.Hill, Dr. H.Benson and others that give you practical information that you can use to help yourself, not like Lipton that sends you over to Psych-k for the understanding and healing that you thought this book would give you."
3,Half is better than none,"The doctor presents a very interesting and original view of cellular biology and the metaphor of cells as humans is cute, even if very common in any eastern philosophical model. It becomes less interesting however, when he wears off his knowledge path into fields he does not understand such as quantum physic, chaotic mathematic and fractal geometry. The conclusions he reaches are hurried and ungrounded, his supporting arguments simplistic and superficial. Throughout the book he makes many claims to finding happiness and well being only to discover at the end that alas, he has no advice for us, only a forwarding address..."
4,Great Enlightenment!,This book really made me see the inside of who I am.. The reality of me..I love that I can change my thoughts and help to create the best right down to my cells.Great book!
4,Was attracted to this book...now I see why!,"With the movie, ""the Secret"" making the Law of Attraction a mainstream curiosity, this book (which I DEFINITELY was attracted to) really explains the science of HOW all of this works in laymen's terms, in a very easy read. I am reading it for the second time to really grasp the new biology. Would like to see more about PSYCHK (included as an Epilogue) but very exciting. Thank you Dr. Lipton!"
4,More about brain and our future,"Excellent addition to the literature regarding the biological bases of belief, behavior and that which ""makes us human"". Raises serious but needed challenges to the soley psychodynamic theories of belief and behavior, however, recognizes the unitary nature of the wholistic human who must take responsibility for that which is within choice even in the face of biological predeterminants. Richard H. Cox, MD, PHD"
5,"The solution to the healthcare ""problem""","I could make this complicated or lengthy, I choose to make it simple. You want a solution to your day to day symptoms? Read this book. You want a solution to the national healthcare spending nightmare? Read this book. More importantly, LIVE this book."
2,I wanted to like it more...,"I find this idea interesting, but I really didn't get anything more from the book than I did from listening to his interview on the BrainSync podcast - he used a number of the same analogies and they both end in the same place ([...])Overall, I felt like it was too ""dumb down"" -- as if the author didn't think the masses could grasp the theory."
2,The Biology of Belief?Unleashing The Power of Consciousness,"I felt it was very scientific and difficult reading. I wasn't able to get past 20 minutes with this book although I am sure by the title it has great information in it. I don't feel it's for the average person more medical / scentific minds. Truthfully, I feel my money was wasted and wish I would of took the time to return it."
2,This author misses the mark!,"I am disappointed with this author. There is too much theory to wade through versus application. I wish all of these want-to-be doctor authors could use Dr. Wayne Dyer as the example. If this author would of at least had a closing summary with each chapter, filled with applications and a good review, then I would have given this author a B+, or A, which would of been four or five stars."
1,What a waste of time and money!,I threw this book away before I even finished reading it. I wish I had read all of the reviews before buying this book. Don't waste your time or money on this one! Check out ALL the reviews before you decide for yourself.
5,Outstanding recipes -- great tasting and easy to prepare,"Todd English provides simple, relatively easy to prepare recipes that will delight your taste buds. The pizza ideas are simple to prepare, and will inspire you to try combinations you didn't think possible. The rissoto recipes can make either a quick family meal or provide a wonderful accompaniment for a more formal meal with friends. There are also some excellent recipes for chicken or other main courses that can be prepared in less than an hour and will absolutely amaze you.English is quite creative, and these recipes are mostly quick and easy. A great cook book."
2,Not one of his best,"After thoroughly enjoying the Olives cookbook and Olives dessert, I was disapointed at the simplicity of this cookbook. I was expecting more eye opening dishes from the master of Mediterranean cooking."
5,Great Seller,"Before I knew it, my book had arrived -- in better condition than i'd expected. Lucky me! I definitely recommend this seller."
3,"So much info that it's hard to get ""actionable"" reading","Dr. Weil promises in the early pages to not bore the readers with too much very detailed scientific data, and to focus on what the reader can actually improve in his day-to-day diet. But Dr. Weil doesn't deliver. The book is full of so much science, in such detail, that i) it's hard to follow; ii) it's hard to understand what is the end recommnedation.In net, not recommneded, unless you need it to get a PHD. If you're looking for a way to eat healthier, not sure you'll get it out of this book."
5,Andrew Weil AND Bill Philips,"Forget what the guy below said - this is a great book. I have also read Body For Life by Bill Philips, and have been following the Body For Life workout plan, and I found Andrew Weil's book to be a great complement to Body For Life. Body for Life gives very sound advice for working out, and Andrew Weil gives very sound advice about nutrition. There's really nothing in either book that makes them in any way mutually exclusive. Anyone seriously interested in getting in shape and eating properly should get both books. You don't have to be a bio-chemist or a workout/gym guru to read either. I knew little to nothing about working out or proper nutrition before reading these books and they both helped me greatly. Thanks Dr. Weil - for an interesting, informative, and very useful book."
2,Read this if you aspire to the body fat % of the author.,"There are those who say, and there are those who do. I am left rather unimpressed with ""healthy"" fat people. Please make your own judgements.Side Note: Men consuming soy protein will be glad to know that it will help increase their estrogen levels; the man-breasts you've dreamed about can be yours.Source: Strauss, et al. ""Genistein exerts estrogen-like effects in male mouse reproductive tract,"" Mol Cell Endocrinol 1998 Sep 25;144(1-2);83-93"
2,Andrew Weil is a big fat............,"I'm sorry, but I just cannot take seriously a man this overweight writing on eating for optimum health. I mean, if I follow his guidelines will I be big and fat like he is? Either what he is promoting isn't working for him, or he is hitting the food bars incognito."
1,Why listen to what a FAT guy has to say about nutrition?,"At first, I was very interested in this book. However, after using some ""simple, good, common sense"" I realized something. Why would anyone in their right mind listen to what a FAT guy has to say about nutrition? It just isn't logical. Do you want to look like him? I certainly don't. I suggest taking a look at the book BILL PHILIPS wrote, BODY FOR LIFE. This guy is in phenominal shape. If you want to LOOK YOUR BEST, take a look at his book. Otherwise, go ahead and buy FATTY'S book."
3,Good But Hard to Follow In Today's Busy World,"I liked the book but found that some of the tips don't apply in today's fast-paced environment. I can't cook everyday and spend hours a day preparing the perfect meal, so it is hard to follow everything recommended. But, I did like this book better than some of the others."
5,Dr. Weil's work is a great service to us all.,Dr. Weil's diet and lifestyle recommendations have changed my life in so many positive ways. I refer all of my students to his work so they too can reap the benefits of his collected wisdom. Bill Douglas ...
3,Livable Guidelines,"I have read several health related books and this one touches most of the basics. His guidelines are focused on the average over weight American. The concept of glaucemic index is a new one to me, but makes a lot of sense.This will not wake anyone up or get anyone to make drastic changes in their lifestyle. It only covers the basics."
5,An Essential Book to Own,"I only wish that my Doctor was as knowledgeable as Dr. Weil. I have read most of his books, and they have changed my life.I don't mind the scientific background, because this allows you to become fully aware of how your body works, and how your diet and thinking affects your physical being.This book will help you conquer many problems that ail people - it has helped me overcome a disease, and I know that it could work for many other people. You just have to have the desire to help yourself, and make some lifestlye changes."
2,Alternative Health for Beginners,"I really wanted to like this book more. Unfortunately, I found it very basic. Someone who is just beginning to explore healthy eating and the how-to's of living a healthy life in the Land of the Whopper might find inspiration and information here. If you've already been reading about and trying to live this lifestyle, there is nothing new here. I thought the 1-2 page success stories did not delve in enough to really tell the reader how the person managed to overcome their bad eating habits (""I started giving up fast food restaurants...later I started eating better at home."") I was really hoping for more."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book in hopes that I would have a good reference for healthy eating. Instead, it seems more of a ""commercial"" for Dr. Weil.And, his way of eating is not practical. His philosophy is to never use anything processed or from the grocery store. Fine if you live on a farm where you can organically grow your own food, but some of us live hectic lives in big cities. Give us advice that real humans in the 21st century can use - not something left over from the '60's.I don't recommend this one. There are other books out there that you can buy that are more geared towards healthy eating in today's world."
1,Average Reader,"The book is totally cofusing and full of contradictions. Reminds of a road map that takes you everywhere and nowhere.it states that the foods with high GI range, should generally be avoided. Then it lists banana, pineapple, and cantaloup as higher than average. Based on this book then, these fruits are not good food anymore! He mentions that he does not expect us to carry calculator when we dine, but that's exactly what we should do if we follow his convoluted directions. It is not even good reading. The only thing I found out from his book that French Fries is bad for you. Big deal, most people who buy the book, already know that.why is he promoting supplement? isn't a dangerous proposition if you are not careful. Is he catering to the supplement industry as well."
3,"Sound, sensible, and spiritually profound","I am convinced of this....with the plethora of diet books lining our shelves, and so many experts in diametrical opposition to the other so called experts, it's honestly a refreshing change to have a diet book come out by an author who obviously has little desire to even remotely appear as though he follows his own advice. Let's face it, no one will ever mistake Andy Weil for Bill Phillips, but alas that is not my point! It's about time someone stepped up to the plate and wrote a diet book for all of us ""corpulent contents"" Thanks Andy....you da man! Peace be with you."
5,This book tells you what you already know.,"OK as I said, this book does not tell you any thing you do not already know. However it organizes it in a way that makes sense and helps you to put it all together. There is nothing revolutionary or supernatural in the way Andrew Weil puts food in prospective with everything in our lives. However this book does make for good reading. It is not just a theory book however. There is statistics, explanations and even recipes. He touches on all aspects of life and how foods relate to them. In essence this is a self-help book that is geared to Eating Well.The Healthy Kitchen"
5,Dr. Weil is great!,"I love Dr. Weil's advice! I think he has his finger on the pulse of a healthy generation (healthy, that is, if they follow his advice). It is a difficult book to read: somewhat dry and a little complicated in the details sometimes... but his summaries are great and the knowledge you walk away with makes it all worthwhile. Here's to good health!!"
5,The Doctor in my Kitchen,"I've changed alot of things about the way I eat since reading this wonderful book. In less than two weeks of eating for optimum health, I have already noticed my cravings have changed for the better. This book answered all of my questions. It all makes sence to me now! Dr. Weil writes in a way that is informative, yet easy to understand, and he adds a bit of his humor in order to emphasize the rediculousness of the fads that all of us have been bombarded with. I feel so free now that I have the knowledge that has pieced everything together and made it so much easier to grocery shop, cook, and eat in restaurants. Thank you Dr. Weil!!"
3,Health for Beginners: Eat and Share,"I placed an order for this book when I've read in Amazon.com reviews, that Dr. Andrew Weil is a leader in the new field of integrative medicine, which combines the best ideas and practices of Western and alternative medicine.Really, with certainty, compassion and humour Dr. Weil addresses management for the intake of our food. But, unfortunately, I found it very basic. I think that this book is best for people who are just beginning to explore natural health.Buy this book if you want the real facts of nutrition. But I was really hoping for more. So I guess I would recommend the book, but not highly, because it's just too intellectual and not a practical enough guide.What is especially cool is that Dr. Andrew Weil invites his readers to visit his website and share our experiences on his program. Are you ready? Sure, I don't."
4,"Dr Weil cuts to the chase,concise,unbiased and down to earth","While I do not own this book, I have been sneaking read sessions in every week at my local book store. Dr. Weil gives a clear, concise unbiased view of diet and how it effects our bodies health in the way we think, feel , behave, etc. Food is medicine as I've known all along and as Dr. Weil states, but most people don't realize this.He also explains very poignantly why United States Americans are so terribly confused about what is and what isn't a healthy diet, the reason for the explodinng GIRTH of America our addictions to certain foods and food substances, and biological factors.(When I say diet I mean eating habits related to one's health, not diets to lose weight)"
2,"Old Wine, New Bottle","Criticizing a well-intentioned man who is likeable and charming, looks like Santa, and is well-intentioned, is always a thankless task. I've met too many people failed by Dr. Weil's methodology; perhaps as many as have benefited. It would be helpful if he subjected his methods to some double blind tests. Yes, orthodox medical practice has all the big bucks, and it would behoove that community to fund these tests. We all know they never will. Nevertheless, in light of the medical communitiy's failure to do so, Dr. Weil should point out that he really has little basis for making his claims. The argument that his techniques are just ""good common sense"" doesn't hold much water. The belief that the sun revolved around the earth was also based on good common sense, and yet it was wrong. Until, the good doctor can prove otherwise, his medicine is as much hit and miss as most other folk medicine. Old wine, new bottle."
4,Part installed easily and works as expected,We went to three different rv parts places and were told we had to have the exact product ID # before they could even order the part. Ordered your product and received it in just a few days and was happy to say the instructions were clear and we were able to install in only a few minutes. Our porta potty works great now. Thanks.
4,Kind of boring,"Then again, look what your reading. If you are interrested asbout optics, read this book."
5,"Hearty, 'Wiltshire Dialect'-flavored poetry","All My Moonshine showcases author Gwen Ellis' hearty, 'Wiltshire Dialect'-flavored poetry from ""Moonshine,"" ""More Moonshine,"" and ""More And More Moonshine"" between the covers of one volume. Spiced with humor and history, and including the addition of twenty new poems, these engaging verses have a unique vibrancy of color and character. Edward Slow: And though, Alas, the folk have gone/Who spoke that way, their names live on/Down through the space of time,/So we are proud of Edward Slow,/Who wrote a Century ago/Our Dialect in Rhyme."
2,?,this is steps down from prior books. my wife commented that she don't think it's by the same author
4,great historical fiction,I am really enjoying this book and know the history quite well....it truly creates the feel of a certain era and that part of the world. I recommend it.
1,Shameless commerical ripoff at the expense of young people.,"I love books for children, especially those that can inspire writing, creativity and interactive dialogue. Every young person should have a journal or diary at least once in their life, but this shameless journal ripoff based on Nick Jr. commercialism is nothing but a slick sticker activity book. Extremely juvenile in its approach it does not inspire young people to write about themselves and their world but merely respond to a network television's idols. If you really want to give your young ones an opportunity to enter the delightful world of journaling, seek out the young person's classic by Linda Kranz, ""All About Me: A Keepsake Journal for Kids"" published by Northland Publishing. This favorite among young people, by Ms. Kranz, now boasts a second ""More About Me, Another Keepsake Journal for Kids"" which lets your young writer explore their world and themselves even further."
2,Disappointing,"This is a 12-page pamphlet, not a book. While the illustrations are clever, the ""poetry"" leaves much to be desired. I was so displeased that this is one of the few books I've ever returned."
4,Better than the past edition,"The 2002 edition of rough guide is a definite improvement over the previous edition of the rough guide. It is a solid guide to the sounds and sights of Costa Rica that has lots of information for the budget traveller. It has good maps and gives good descriptions of most tourist sites. I would say that this would be one of the 4 best guides for the budget traveller right now for Costa Rica--the other three would be the Lonely Planet, Footprint and New Key guides."
5,Great,"Recommended to anybody who hates those stupid ear buds. Perfect companion for an mp3 player, or in my case, MiniDisc player. I also have a McIntosh receiver and the PORTAPROs work great with it. Very good bass response and clear highs, without drowning out the mids and the lows and they are comfortable and collapse to fit in your pocket."
2,"OK movie, but there are better ways to use your time.","The story was not that great.If you are looking for agreat movie, this is not it.But you don't know for sure until you try it."
5,Pure joy,"Many years ago, I bought this Rubinstein as an album and Van Cliburn's ""My Favorite Chopin."" I still love them both, but the warmth in Rubinstein's playing is the gold standard. This is a wonderful compilation from the master."
3,Not bad,"It's basically what you'd expect, a good behind the scenes look at CNN's coverage of the 2000 election, what the reporters remember, the key events that happened. Ironic that in early 2001, that seemed to be the moment everyone would remember from that time period, and the special was probably filmed in the winter or spring of 2001, but once 9/11 happened, all that seemed to disappear. That just seemed striking to me watching the special."
2,A Solid Examination of Stupidity,"In this highly ambiguous, glossy, rewrite of the 2000 election, we witness the stupidity that is CNN. Whether you are to the left or right of the political spectrum, this recap will appall you. Especially if you have any respect for history; worse still if you favor detail.This film jumps over events as if they never even happened. You will read history books, reading digests, etc., that will tell the events in the proper context of their import during this fateful election, yet the news, the actual news, will barely even mention them, if at all. Probably because it is as much their fault, as the actual perps.CNN is a pathetic, empty, propaganda machine. And we can not do anything about it.Pathetic film."
5,Magnificent,"If you don't like politics steer clear of CNN -Election 2000, but if you are interested in politics the process and this important part of American political history get this DVD.I thoroughly enjoyed the informative reflections of CNN anchors and felt that the program represented the situation fairly and without bias.The DVD is worth far more than what Amazon is asking for, so even though America is an election and five years past this event, if you are interested in looking back in time to an extremely interesting point in American political history, you can't go past this title."
3,What really happened in Florida in the 2000 Election?,"We all know what happened during the 2000 Elections, particularly in Florida. No one expected it, it was ""unprecedented."" At the time, everything was jumbled through the media, and it was really hard to get a good look at the news going on regarding, what was going on. Now, almost 4 years later, this DVD anwsers the call. If you want the truth about what really happened, and what was really going on in Florida during the election and shortly after, then rent this DVD. A little comedy was added in for kicks, and it showed what each side was doing during the time, from a much unbiased perspective."
1,"Good, but biased","I felt that I played a role in the 2000 election, and seeing this CNN compilation of memorable moments in the 36 days that followed the election made me feel somewhat cheated. For example, the last chapter is titled ""Gore Finally Concedes"", which gives the false impression that the country was dying to hear a concession from Gore. But otherwise, an average DVD with a good musical score. I wouldn't spend the extra 5 dollars on the DVD version, though."
5,Stunning,"This compilation is absolutely stunning. Grooverider uses some great songs (new and familiar alike) and employs some great mixing methods (and all done live!). I can barely recognize some of the songs sometimes, each song flows so good a top another that it turns into somethin completely different and new. This is what so many people are missing out in when they hear a set by a Dj-- when they put an unusual spin on a set of songs that act more like a constant flow of sound rather than song after song bounded by a breezy moment of mixing. Rock on, Grooverider"
1,Chock Full of Obvious,"Once again, I was hoodwinked by reviewers at Amazon.com who have no ability to discern good from average. This book provides a bunch of no-brain chapters -- (i.e. classifying is good) -- it's really a huge waste of money. The absolute best book I've read and I recommend to all discerning intellectual teachers is Grant Wiggins's Understanding By Design. This book was a waste of my good time and precious money. Never again will I so blindly trust all the 5 star givers on this site. Too many stooges, I think."
2,"Something old, nothing new","Imagine that, another educator taking age old ideas-for the most part-renaming the components & making a nice deposit in his bank account. Go back and dust off titles by Hunter, Bloom, & the like & you'll do yourself a favor. Or if you're really ambitious go to school, get your doctorate in Ed & package old ideas as new like Marzzano has done."
3,Classroom Instruction that Works,"This book arrived in great condition, like new. The book itself is well-written, but really has no new information for experienced teachers. For a new teacher, it has good ideas and techniques for presenting materials to students."
3,"product good, price bad, shipping bad","The product I purchased was exactly what it was supposed to be. The price I paid Amazon, however, was a 200% markup from what they paid the company that sent it to me. I understand making a profit, but this is ridiculous. Shipping also took much longer than the website advertised. The 3-5 working days promised turned into an actual 15 calendar days, meaning the item arrived long after I needed it. Book, good. Amazon, not good."
5,Enhanced with informative charts and graphs,"Robert J. Marzano, Debra J. Pickering, and Jane E. Pollock draw upon their many years of experience and expertise as educators to effectively collaborate in providing an informative series of nine research-based strategies for the use of classroom teachers seeking to increase their student's achievement levels. These strategies include identifying similarities and differences; summarizing and note taking; reinforcing effort and providing recognition; homework and practice; nonlinguistic representations; cooperative learning; setting objectives and providing feedback; generating and testing hypotheses; questions, cues, and advance organizers. Enhanced with informative charts and graphs, and highly recommended for student teacher reading lists and classroom management studies, Classroom Instruction That Works will enable teachers to enable their students to learn how to take effective notes, work in groups, and use graphic organizers."
3,Research on Teaching,"This is a very dry book with a lot of excellent ideas. Though hard to read, it is valid in what it presents."
4,Good book - Poor quality in construction,"I bought this book because I'd borrowed it from the school's professional development library. The content is great, but this edition is of poor quality in printing and paper. I'll be more careful int he future about not buying from this publisher."
4,Marzano's Nine,Classroom Instruction That Works by Robert Marzano et al is a really good resource for teachers - old and new. I only wish that there were more examples of specificly how to use these strategies.
2,Just one idea,"This book simply feature one idea: to think, plan and organise on processes instead of on departments and tasks. This is another way to express the old saying: think about what the customer is interested in (the outcome of the process), not about your internal issues (as departments, task, hierarchy and so on. Since Drucker and even sooner this is not new. Even more ennoying is its presumptuous writting. They appoint themselves as overcomers of Adam Smith and his job division. The worst consequence is that many companies have used this book as the rational for downsizing. The beauty of the action has not been achieved (apart from some light improvements) but many workers were fired. In adition the authors became rich. At leat something good was reached (for themselves obviosly)."
3,Reengineering the corporation: A Manifesto for Business Revolution [By James Champy],"A good book if for no other reason, to put into context for his subsequent books."
4,A must-read book,"It's sometimes difficult to find good managerial books that are based on more than pure management theories. This book is an exception. A must read piece of art crafted by people with feet deeply planted into the real way of doing things at corporations.This book strains people's brain in the sense that they feel compelled to think about what is going on at work heading for a better company through reengineering established processes. Specially for me, this book also brings hope, hope that no matter how critical some process (which in many cases we are part of) may be, there is always a solution that can be pursued.But the book also comes with a major drawback. One may think that the solution for all problems is reengineering."
3,Brilliant product of the ghostwriter,"Donna Sammons Carpenter ghostwrote this book.It made waves when it first came out.However, like most management fad books, its message is not really relevant any more.Buy and read a real management book, for example, something or anything by Alfred Chandler."
2,Manifesto?,"This book is rated far too high. The authors just repeat the same story over and over again. The structure could also be better as the definition what ""reengineering"" means is firstly explained in the second chapter. Funny is, that most of the positive examples (companies) already crashed (eg Kodak), which shows the value of such management bibles. The readability is quite good so for some readers it might be an ideal book for the beach. BUT I would never call such thing a manifesto!"
2,Buzzwords Galore,"Read this if you are or want to be a middle manager who needs to know the words to understand the boss. It's also good if you can't get enough of your current middle managers voice but that's about it. Perhaps if I had read it 5 years ago, but now it's just annoying. I think a new process is in order."
1,Can Find Most of This in the News,I suspect much of this was for peoplr already running businesses. Much of it is already in the news if you keep up with business magazines and CNBC.
2,Greasy,"This cream is not what I expected. I wanted something moisturizing, a little more so than a day lotion. I found this cream very light, so it felt nice putting on, but I find it also greasy. My face is greasy the next day--even after washing my face in the morning and applying a different lotion."
4,"Dark, Deep toned recording","IMO, certain opera recordings require a certain voice-type. Unfortunately, the role of Amelia I feel requires a more light beautiful voice. Sadly, Leontyne Price's voice is just to heavy for this, beautiful as it is, it is too deep and too dark. IMO the most beautifully-sounding Amelia is Montserrat Caballe."
3,"Good and entertaining, but often rambling commentary on life","I really enjoyed parts of this book, which is really a collection of essays on life in general, but the author often rambles, in search of a point, and while portions of the book are enduring, some of it must be endured until another good essay pops up."
2,Not So Helpful,"I was really disappointed in this book, but I should not have been. I read all of the reviews and decided to purchase anyway. It seems that the the 5-star ratings are given by credentialed professionals (are they colleges or friends helping another?), while the mothers who truly need strategies to implement at home are not finding this book helpful, and giving the lower-star rating. I fall in the latter category. As the mother of three under the age of 5, I get angry with my children and I truly want to learn how to break this cycle of anger in my family. More ""me"" time isn't the only answer."
2,Not helpful,"I agree with the other reviewer - ""not as helpful as I would have liked."" Disappointing. Basically, a lot of suggestions when you can hire babysitters often. Also, not practical advice for hectic lives today."
2,Not Nearly as Helpful as I Would Have Hoped,"For starters, I was not happy to find on the first page that the author is not even a parent herself, but a part-time caregiver.That aside, I appreciate that moms (myself included) certainly do need to make time for themselves and let more things go. Unfortunately, this book does not relate really well to a working mother of 2 very small children, who can't just let everything go, and have lots of Mom-time. My kids still need a lot of care at this point, and I prefer to spend most of my non-working time with them. Also, I found the cutesy tone of the book annoying and distracting from the substance and content.Maybe this book is helpful for parents of older children, but it just doesn't work for me"
3,"Okay, but....","This book has a lot of good suggestions to be a better parent, but I've yet to see how it deals with the issue of stress. I have two year old twins, and was hoping for more guidance on dealing with frustration and stress that inevitably comes from being with my kids 24/7. They are good kids, but constantly having to be patient wears me thin. This book is like most...it suggests being ""patient."" Being patient is not my problem, it's handling the pent-up frustration! I will concede that the author has suggestions such as getting help, making friends, etc. All of these things are a good idea, but if you're like me you find it hard to muster the energy to parent full-time and do all of these other things and do them well. I guess you just have to see it as a work in progress. Strive to achieve these goals and don't beat yourself up if you're not doing it perfectly."
1,Piece of junk,"Antenna mount will only accomodate a surface less than 1/8"" think and fiberglass is thicker. Poorly made and painted, won't stand up to saltwater."
5,SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE,"IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN FRUSTRATED, SAD, CONFUSED, ABUSED,LONELY, OVERWHELMED; IF YOU'VE EVER FELT UNAPPRECIATED; IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN A CAREGIVER; IF YOU'VE EVER LOST A LOVED ONE - THE AUTHORSWILL DRAW YOU INTO THEIR CIRCLE BY ACCEPTING WHO YOU ARE AND STILL, THROUGH THEIR STORIES, HELPING YOU TO GROW, HEAL AND MOVE ON-- IT WAS A THOUGHT PROVOKING, SOUL-SEARCHING AND INSPIRING EXPERIENCE."
1,"Clearly, a triumph of promotion over substance","I'm at a loss. I could not figure out why this book exists. What is the point? Are readers assumed to be interested in gossip about people we don't know and we don't care about? Does it promote some silly Oprahesque morality about ""being real""? Or are we just supposed to be grateful to bask in the fabulousness of these women?I must repeat the words of another reviewer: fatuous, self-absorbed drivel.And if you're still tempted to buy this book, note that the positive reviews come from the state of Florida. Obviously, syncophant friends of the Miami Bombshells who ARE grateful to bask in their fabulousness."
1,Embarassing...,Six over the hill bimbos recount their triumph over nothing particularly interesting or challenging---really lame self-absorbed fatuous (the six of you can look that word up later) drivel...
5,Using Java 2 Standard Edition,Excellent book!!! Even somebody like me could understand it and write couple of programs! I will say book had something to do with it. Best one by far.
4,hey sister moon...,"transvision vamp is a band i remember, but never really heard during their peak. mostly i remember them from reading the british music teen rag smash hits'...american version. after hearing about them on a kylie minogue message board, i decided to give them a shot. i came across this best of release and i must say i was pleasantly surprised.they are loud, sassy and made some of the trashiest pop rock i've ever heard. as a transvision vamp virgin, i can say i was satisfired. granted there are a few fillers, but overall i was highly pleased. standout tracks for me were the epic ""velveteen"", ""baby i don't care"", ""tell that girl to shut up"", ""kiss their sons"", ""if looks could kill"" and the irresistable ""sister moon"" which i must have listened to 100 times since i got this cd."
2,could have been much better,"This collection of Transvion songs is missing their best- Back on my knees again, Every little thing, You dont believe the type,and You put the spell on me all from LIttle bubble album. Bad Valentine is the one really great one on here. Falling for a gold mine and Down on you also would be great. So all in all, not actually the best of this band."
5,Thoughtful and thought-provoking,"Shards of Glass by Frederick Wolf offered a rare glimpse into depths of character rarely explored in fiction. Each of us is mired in our perspective of the world, a perspective that changes dramatically between raw youth and seasoned age. This story was told from the twin perspectives of a young man edging into a military career, and that same man looking back on a long life. Mr. Wolf masterfully catches the nuances of both, drawing the reader into a unique understanding that could not have otherwise been achieved. I was very touched by many of the scenes in this book. But more importantly, for the first time I felt as if I'd begun to understand the true horror of war as it plays out within the individual. As in Conrad's Hearts of Darkness, the individual in this book finds himself in a moral vacuum in which there really was no right or wrong.This is a powerful story, powerfully told. I will read it again and again."
4,i like it,cool to fold dollar bills. not too hard to follow instructions. wish they had a origami of a fish though.
2,Overly complex folding for similar end product,"I have been folding regularly for 1 year, and have made many of these designs before. Unfortunately when someone asked me to teach them one I looked at his diagrams and was so confused that I couldn't believe they had the same end result. Overly complex and not particularly clear diagrams. If authors keep coming out with diagrams like this then people will switch to internet video to learn origami. This is a diservice to the origami community."
1,Great designs but hard-to-follow instruction,"I was very excited by the designs in this book but I felt like steps were missing in the instructions and therefore, I was unable to complete several of the pieces. I have other books by John Montroll and have not had this problem before. Needless to say, I was dissapointed in this book."
3,God but tough,"This is very similar to his other book. It has some great ideas but the directions are less than desireable. Not for beginers. (barely for the hard core folder) The tree on the front of the book we pretty easy. But most of the folds seem to skip steps and leave you scratching your head. It is a good addition to my collection but ""the buck book"" & ""the guide to Hawaiian-style money folds"" are the best ones I own."
2,fun but frustrating?,"I thought this would be a fun way to give money as a gift by tucking 20 one dollar bills between the pages. When my sons and grandsons flipped through, they were definitely delighted with the dollars, but most of the origami was pretty advanced and hard to follow. They soon lost interest, but still talk about the novelty of the packaging."
1,almost worthless,"I am not sure why an author of origami would publish a book that doesn't show a picture or a drawing after or during a fold. That way I would know for sure that my folds were in the correct direction. I have another book that does this and it was so clear with how to complete a project. With digital photography today, it should be so easy to do."
3,Its OK,"I bought the book because it seemed to be written well, but after dealing with the first few chapters that go over the basics I've become fed up enough to write this review.They explain a button or drop down's functionality (there are lots of them all over the place) and they don't simply show a picture of the interface element with which you are suppose to be interacting. They'll use words to describe where it is and what it looks like, but I'm always looking all over the place for what they are talking about. It really slows me down and wastes a lot of time."
3,Hard to follow if your new,"Im brand new to the 3d world. I had no clue how 3ds max 4 worked at all. I was clueless about what book to buy but for some reason i coose this one. I have only had it for a few weeks but it is so hard to follow its quite frustrating to use. Now it might just be a hard program to use but the book leads you though but you spend a lot of time looking for buttons, finding shapes and not really sure what the book wants you to do after you find it. I dont know if all the books are like this but i sure hope not. I just want to do fun stuff and it doesnt really look like the book even shows you how to. But im just in the begining so i have no ideas. Do you have an idea of a better book that wont take forever to lean? It looks quite exclusive in some of its progrmas. It needs to be shaped for the newbe in the beging of the book. I have spend hours with this book and got no were. You have to much dissifing to do."
1,BOARING!!!,"I read this book in my 9th grade english class, The book was not appealing to me at all, There is alot of bad language, and it was wrote from a girls point of veiw. The book was about an overweight girl and a homosexual boy that become freinds and get picked on. Brendan the homosexual, messes up a bullys truck, and is put in a group of people, including the fat girl and the bully, to talk about what they did to be put in the class instead of expelled."
5,My 9 month old's absolute favorite toy!,"To be quite honest, I have no clue why my son loves this toy so much. It was the first Fisher Price toy he really took to. He loves the spinning discs and loves to grab the balls and knock them off. This toy is obnoxious to parents because the balls are loud, but your baby will absolutely love it. My son (who hardly plays with anything longer than a second) will play with this toy for at least a half hour. I look forward to purchasing more Peek A Round toys for my son!"
3,Excellent fun - limited durability!,"My son who just turned a year, loves the toy. Again, yes it is noisy but that is what catches the attention of the little ones. HOWEVER, I am exchanging mine as well because the disks stopped turning. Not because of the battery but because my son likes to hold the disks still and now they don't turn. He loves the toy though and we will be exchanging it for another one, exactly the same. He would miss it too much!"
2,"Lots of fun for baby, but wears out in weeks!","Like some many others, I found that this toy was a lot of fun for my baby. UNFORTUNATELY it wore out in a matter of weeks. I tried taking it apart. I was able to get it to work for a few more weeks, but after that it refused to spin. It has been very frustrating since we bought more balls just for this toy. What a waste! I am going to call the company tomorrow!"
2,Boring!,"My 9 month old really loves the Incrediblock, and I already had a set of the round ""blocks"" so I got this one for him. Big mistake! I have the same complaints as the other parents, it is too loud with more than one ball and doesn't really do much (especially for $20). We amuse ourselves by putting other stuff on the spinners (like toy trucks). My son could really care less about this. I wish I could return it but we threw away the box."
2,wish i would have waited for FP to work the bugs out !,"in concept this is an adorable toy, but i have a few big issues with it:1. SO loud & noisy! the racket the plastic balls make when they roll around!!! you have to strain to enough hear the animal sounds & music2. although my 6 month & 2 yr old like it (noisy & newest toy in the house), it is honestly incredibly BORING! pretty much the entire entertainment value is putting the balls thru the tree, etc & when they hit the base it spins...that is it! i like toys that ""do"" something, or entertain..meaning a great improvement on this toy would be to have extra sounds ~ a creak when when you open the tree door, monkeys chattering when you see the monkeys behind the door, water gurgling/bubbles when the ball hits the waterfall....but nothing!i really wish i would have waited for FP to redesign/revamp this toy before i rushed out & got it. not much to it & most certainly not worth the money!!"
3,"OK, but too noisy...","at first, my 7-month-old baby seemed a little scared at the loud sound of this toy. so I need to play the sound only without the plastic ball to reduce its noise. and after he got used to it, I started give him a couple of balls to play with this jugle toy. Now my baby seems to like it. however, the noise of playing with balls on this jungle toy is sort of bad, I think."
1,QUIET PLEASE!,"This toy is loud and obnoxcious! The balls spin and clatter so loud that even with it set on loud volume, you can't hear the music! The butterfly on the side broke off within the 1st week. The balls are a lot of fun but the noise!! Ack!!! My Daughter won't even play with it. It makes her a nervouse wreck! She plays with the balls though!"
3,Jungle Friends Treehouse,I was a little disappointed with this toy. I thought there would be more for my daughter to do with it. There's really not that much to play with on it.
2,Great toy if it works.,"We got this toy for my daughter for Christmas. Like other people have said, you cant hear the music over the clanking of the balls but she enjoyed it anyway. She played with it for about 2 weeks before the plates stopped spinning. I called Fisher Price to ask for a replacement and after giving them 2 numbers off the bottom of the toy she told me they would put a check in the mail for $25 and I would not have to return the product. Save your money and go with one of the other toys from the Roll-a-round line."
3,Really cute!,My eight month old loves this toy and learned alot. She already puts the balls in the tree. But I am annoyed that after two weeks the things on the bottom don't turn anymore. I replaced the batteries but it is not working. I don't understand what broke it?
3,"Great Toy, Baby loved it...It broke in 2 months","My daughter loved this toy, but she did miss the balls rolling around which she loved the most. She learned to press the red button but has not yet learned to put the balls in the hole, unfortunately when she does she still won't see the balls roll around. So for now she just throws the balls around. Durability is not good. I figured out what needed to be fixed and finally fixed it myself. Hair had gotten inside and siezed the spinners. I opened it up and pulled out all the hair and then it worked again."
1,Jungle Treehouse RollArounds,"My son absolutely loves any toy that contains balls. He loved this toy when he got it. I agree with others that the music cannot be heard when the balls are rolling around. We didn't even know it played music at first. Unfortunately the first week my son got this toy it stopped working. The music still plays, but the disks that spin the balls around stopped working. We were very disappointed with this toy."
1,Too loud and very different than picture!,"I agree with a past review that this toy is too loud. You can't even hear the music when the balls are bouncing around. But that is not my problem. The hole that you drop the balls in on the top of the treehouse is not on the top as it appears in all pictures on the web site, on this website, on the box, even in the instructions inside. The hole to put the balls in is in the front of the tree. It requires a completely different skill set to use this. It is not a 6 month toy. I called to complain and was treated terribly and told ""we know about it. There is a disclaimer ont he box that contents can differ from picture."" THAT WAS THEIR ANSWER TO ME!!! I thought that was pretty crappy. My 13 month old son cannot even figure out how to get the balls in that hole.What poor poor cusomter service. I even talked to a manager and got that same poor and rude service."
2,Great concept... NOISY RACKET THOUGH !,"Fisher Price has a great concept, but needs to go back to the designing steps. Rubberized balls would be much quieter and much smoother rollers than plastic. I took our toy apart and lined the spinners with felt so they would not wobble which was creating a noise even without the balls on them. We use racket balls with the toy now and my 6 month old does enjoy the activity.Hope Fisher Price reads these reviews.apep@chartermi.net"
2,Cute but too loud!!!,"Very cute toy and neat concept, but when you get all the balls going the noise gets so unbearable that even my 14 month old puts her hands to her ears! The toy plays a nice little jungle tune which ofcourse you can't hear over the racket. :-("
2,Poor construction quality means no more spinning,"My son loved this toy. Too bad it wasn't made to Fisher Price standards. It didn't last. I guess it just wore out - no more spinning. My 18 month-old was a little rough with it holding down the spinning circles and trying to spin them himself. I didn't give it a second thought because you know, it's Fisher Price. It should be able to handle an 18 month-old! Sigh. He was getting frustrated it didn't spin anymore I had to get rid of it. What a waste."
1,Loud and boring!,"If you or your baby are sensitive to noise, don't get this toy! When the balls are on the turntables, you can't even hear the music. It was so loud that it scared my 8 month old! Aside from the noise, it's very boring. My baby was bored after a couple of minutes. I usually like Fisher Price toys, but don't waste you money on this one! Try the ""Laugh and Learn"" learning table or the gym wall...both have lots of activities and have proven safe so far!"
2,Too Noisy,"Santa brought this toy to our daughter. Immediately, we were completely turned off by how noisy the toy became when you added the balls. The roll a rounds drop hard and loudly onto the platforms and then clank so loudly that you can barely hear the music in the background. The balls do not need to drop this hard to activate the music, as simply rolling over the buttons works. It is a very poor design. We are very disappointed with this product. Our daughter does enjoy pushing the big red button."
3,Loads of fun but doesn't last...maybe we got a defective one??,We bought this toy for our 8 month old daughter for Christmas. She loved watching the balls go around and it was neat that she could turn it on by herself with the big red button. She played with it for a couple of days -- nothing rough either -- and on the third day the wheels stopped spinning so the balls could not roll around. I tried everything to fix it but ended up calling Fisher Price who were nice on the phone and are sending a voucher to get a new one.I'm hoping we just got a defective one because our daughter really enjoys this toy when it works properly. It still plays music but she is not interested in it at all when it doesn't spin.
2,Too loud and not that interesting,As most reviewers have said the balls clack around too loudly. You can't hear the music. It scared my 6m old more than excited her. Disappointed in overall wow factor of this toy.
5,Another great toy by Fisher-Price,"I bought this for my son when he was 10 months old. He loves it still at 13 months. He loves to put the balls in the tree and watch them spin. There is also a door on the tree that opens to reveal a monkey. He loves to keep opening and closing the door to see the monkey. Great toy, a bit noisy though. When the balls spin it plays music but you can't really hear it because the balls rolling around make a lot of noise."
4,Really cute and fun,"My ten month old plays with this toy on and off all day long. He loves to press the red button and listen to the music and see the discs turn. Today he even tried putting other things through the hole in the tree! I think it's great at teaching him cause and effect and also putting the ball through the hole is a great accomplishment for little ones! The toy is durable, my little one plays rough. When all four balls are on the wheels, the music is drowned out and it is quite noisy. However, my son still likes to play with it. He likes to stop the wheels from turning and also loves to play with the peek a rounds themselves."
4,Excellent soundtrack. One of a kind.,I owned this soundtrack on vinyl many years ago and just loved it. I've been waiting for it to be released on CD for many years. No one can forget Lulu's title hit. But when you hear The Mindbenders for the first time in years you'll feel like you're in high school again. Please rush me this CD as soon as it becomes available.
5,a must have for your collection,"In this recital recording of previously recorded material we are shown why Leontyne Price is the Godess of all verdian sopranos. No one has ever or will ever match her package of talent and beauty that she entertained the world with. Everything in this compilation is simply beautiful and perfect! I own this cd even though I already own most of the box sets the arias come from. If you don't have this cd you simply MUST buy it. If you've been under an opera rock and aren't familiar with Leontyne, you will be very pleased with this cd and she'll quickly become one of your favorite sopranos. and definitely your favorite Verdian soprano"
5,Why Hayek is so Historically Correct!,"One should read Diamond's historical text ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" to understand why thorough the anchaint history of man's developement, Liberty and individualism resulted in the progress of civilization. Read both books similtaneously!skiplem"
5,Excellent book service,"The book came very quickly and was packaged well. Service excellent. Book was in excellent condition, even better than advertised. I appreciate the professional service."
5,A masterpiece !,"I've read a few books from Hayek and I've also studied many economic readings over the years and this one is one of the better books to read. Normally I haven't been a huge fan of Hayek's writing style but this book is so well written and interesting that I would consider it one of his best. So timely for today's world I hope many people are revisting these classics. His views of restricted and small government are spot on and the inspiration for many in today's complicated political world. There are so many ""a-ha"" moments in this book from his view of the welfare state to taxation and I thought his views on the monopoly of public education is spot on too. In summary if you agree with Hayek's views you will love this book and if you don't you should still respect the style and depth of the book."
2,"too much chat, not enough math","I was hoping for something more likeThe Millennium Problems: The Seven Greatest Unsolved Mathematical Puzzles of Our Time, an explanation of the problems and how they were solved, at a reasonably accessible level. This book appears to be just chat about the funny people who become math professors. Sort of interesting, but not what I wanted."
4,Useful and insightful,"The book is well written with the right mix of anecdote and theory. What I do like about it is the fact that we find out a little more about the lives of mathematicians, and they are portrayed as people rather than idols.Where the book falls down is that it goes into a little too much detail of the theorems, something which the non-mathematician will undoubtedly find hard to follow."
4,For cat lovers and others,"Not being a particular Bradbury fan, I wasn't sure about this book when someone gave it to me for--of all things--a baby gift! But we are a four-cat family, so we read it to our infant son, and, now that he's two and a half, it has become one of his very favorite books (honored alongside Green Eggs and Ham and My First Truck Board Book). It has introduced him to ""adult"" language (""big words"") with beautiful rhythm as well as aesthetic illustrations in a context he knows well. And for Mom and Dad, it has well fulfilled the advice not to give your child a book you don't want to read a hundred and fifty thousand times. Recommended for children and adults of all ages!"
3,Nice But Small,"These are a nice quality and well made. Unfortunately, they can be a bit small for some wine bottles. I can get them to fit for the rest but in some cases, it take a bit of work getting them on and off. I would have rated them much higher if they were only slightly larger."
1,Yuck.,"Returned this moisturizer. Smelled of alcohol, like a cheap cologne. I would not recommend this product if you are looking for something ""clean"" smelling. Don't know if it's a good moisturizer..."
4,Love the mirror,I needed a bigger and brighter mirror when doing my hair and makeup. This was bigger and heavier than expected. But that is what makes it so great. Definitely a quality product.
3,Nice but could be better,"Even on the first day I tried it I noticed a difference. Within a few days my skin tone was brighter and luminous. LOOOVEEED the sweet scent. I was even surprised to see some acne-scars become more pronounced...so I figured the lotion to work layer by layer and pushing the acne out. However, now I'm not so happy since my scars haven't minimized. So in case you're acne-prone I don't recommend this product."
2,I don't see anything.,"Well since this was a product i was wanting to try, i bought it, Even thought it was a little overpriced.Well, nothing. I have pretty good skin, I have some black spots (acne scars, or sun spots) but as for pimples just every now and then. This did nothing for my skin. Just another moisturizer. I didn't see my face illuminate, or glow, or anything. I was so disapointed because i really wanted to like this product...i really did..."
4,Olay Definity Correcting Protective Lotion with spf,"I purchased the Olay Definity Correcting a month ago. I chose this one because I am senstive to the stronger ones and this was suppose to be less irritating. This was right, I do not get the teary eyes that last all day from some of the other Olay products. It goes on smooth..feels great and moisturizes well.As far a improving wrinkles I would have to say I have seen no differnce. I have noticed that my skin is softer.Would I buy again? Probably , it just feels so good and makes my makeup go on smooth. It is expensive. I bought the 1.7 oz bottle and it is VERY small for what you spend.I gave it four stars because of the way it feels and makes my skin soft. I would not give it five as I see no diffence in fine lines around my eyes and mouth."
4,good value but be prepared...,"these socks are a good deal for the money but if you order different colors of the same sock at the same time, be prepared to get charged for them to bill you a separate shipping fee for each order...thats what happened to me. i ordered four different colors of the same sock at the same time. instead of them shipping them in one package and billing me once, they shipped them in four different packages and billed me four times. and the kicker is that all four packages arrived at the same time."
1,A confusing struggle,"Having used this book for the last year, I continue to be frustrated by it. While you can learn Italian using it, the student really needs to refer to other texts and an instructor frequently to clear up confusion. The layout is terrible and makes finding the material difficult. Why certain obscure volcabulary words were selected makes no sense, and why other more basic words were not included is equally puzzling. There are few errors, but those that appear can keep the student guessing for awhile. The exercises vary between being trivial and being confusing. This is also true of the accompanying workbook. I really dislike the authors' tendency to introduce a topic but not cover it in detail. For that reason, the student encounters the same topic, e.g., passato prossimo, spread over a number of chapters with no overall summary. It seems like the book grew over a series of editions, and it became more cumbersome with each revision."
2,Che Peccatto!,"I have been using this book as a part of a series of beginning to intermediate level Italian. While the book does an adequate job in some areas, it leaves a lot to be desired. For example, the glossary doesn't contain many of the words used in the book. There are exercise which use words that have not been learned and which are not in the dictionary. The vocabulary in each chapter is somewhat arranged by topic, but is incomplete and confusing. The book is designed to follow as a sort of episodic course, but it is a horrible reference book, and concepts like verb tenses are separated by pages and sometimes over several chapters.It is unfortunate that this seems to be the seminal textbook for Italian. It does the job, but surely there must be something better out there."
2,Minestrone,"This text is a soupy mixture of chunks of material. It follows the annoying trend in language books toward using words and grammatical concepts in exercises before they are introduced and explained. It also still has a number of typos even after several editions. More serious problems are the flat out grammatical usage errors that emerge in the later chapters. The whole subject of accent marks is poorly addressed nor are the verbs (-rre verbs), that contradict the statement that only three endings are possible, ever explained. I also object to the practise of frequently issuing new editions which are superficially modified to sell new books but do not correct or improve the text in any meaningful manner. Teachers please pass on using this textbook!"
1,Confusing,"This is a truly attrocious text book. I've been forced to use it for the last 18 months and it's been almost no help. The layout is confusing, the information contradictory or irrelevant and the price is excessive. Avoid this book like the plague if you're serious about learning Italian."
3,NOT BAD,"A great concept for a ""B"" movie and very well acted, even the antagonist is pretty good. Good Plot and twist to the story with some unexpected surprises. Good for a midnight movie."
2,Bill Cobb was great.....but...,"I get really disappointed when a horror movie has a great actor, and then leads the whole film down the path of destruction. I mean, at the end of this movie, we all just looked at each other very confused. There was plenty of empty space for filler in this film for them to EXPLAAAAIIIIINNNN stuff. Did they utilize this filler time? Nope.Nothing was explained, and even though that type of cliffhanger CAN work, I've got to tell ya it doesn't work here.2 stars for Bill Cobb...he's awesome.Minus everything else."
1,no point,"this is probably one of the worst movies I've seen in a while, it goes really slow, has no point, and jumps around, at the end all I could think was ""Wow that was a waste of time and money"""
4,Premier Organist Pays Due to Bach on Organ,"Much of this album is awesome organ work of Bach's pieces, especially his performance of Toccata and Fugue in D Minor and the Little Fuge in G Minor.This would have been five stars easily were it not due to the odd sound on such Bach pieces Air For G-String and the work from Cantata No. 156. Possibly having heard them on other instruments, i.e. classical guitar and orchestra, this sounds like the old ""roller skating rink rendition."" It was and remains well played and certainly require the utmost in talent and performance skills, but these to my ear just do not provide justice to Bach's pieces.The CD however is just outstanding to have for its brilliant pieces."
4,"Good performace, no documentation.","Virgil Fox was certainly one of the great organists of his century! This performance is a good example Virgil's mega-organ approach to Bach (and everything else). It greatly contrasts with the ""historically informed"" instruments and performances we are used to today.One complaint is that the cd includes no documentation aside from the list of tracks. There is no organ description or stoplist (although a quick search on google will yield this). There is no essay on the performance or biographical information about the organist. The photo on the front cover doesn't relate to the recording in any way. Certainly, this recording could have been more thoughtfully prepared.Then again, you can beat the price."
3,OK !,"This is a good cd for Bach organ works. I'm sorry to say this is not my favorite version of the ""Tocatta and Fugue in D"". Murray, on the Telarc label back in the 80's, had a better interpretation, speed, and technique. That organ was also the best I have ever heard!This cd however has my favorite version of the ""Little Fugue in G minor"", ""Jesu, Joy of Man's Desire"", ""Sheep May Safely Graze"", and ""Sleepers Wake!"". I thought ""Air for the G-String"", and ""Arioso"" were rushed.I don't listen to organ music, harpsichord music, or symphonies as much as other genres.Good day !"
4,WHY,"why would anyone give this CD any less than 4 stars? I don't pretend to be an expert on the music of J.S. Bach, but I do know what sounds good. This is good music to listen to, especially if you are in the mood to listen to a mighty church organ played by a master of his craft."
3,Good introduction to Bach organ tunes,"This CD is probably a good introduction to school children on some popular organ works by Bach. The first work ""Toccata and Fugue in D Minor"" will be immediately familiar to anyone who has ever gone to a haunted house. ""Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring"" is another familiar tune and done quite prettily. ""Now Thank We All Our God"" is churchy. The rest of the CD tracks 4-8 seem too sleepy for me. The last one is ""Sleepers, Wake!"", at least he tried, ha ha."
2,"Grammar F, Research F... but it is true","It is true that this book is poorly written and edited.The author may have failed in some of his research and included ""characters"" that he forgot to introduce, but the main story is true.My father was the pastor of the church in East Ridge, Tennessee, and was a first hand witness to the events that took place there.My father speaks of this story as one of his saddest experiences."
1,Pictured Filter is not the one I received!,"Like some customers before me I had problems with this item. In fact, I called customer service (BEFORE I ordered the item) to make sure that the item pictured would be the item I received. Alas, it was not--the kind of filter really does matter. So I called again and was told that the matter would be looked into--here's hoping someone does their job and keeps their promise!"
2,meh,I bought it because of the ceephax song I couldn't find anywhere else. The rest of the CD is a bit dissapointing. :(
1,Caveat Emptor,"I also use this book as part of the Masters course in Sydney and I cannot remember the last time I picked it up to read as I have better things to do with my time than try and work through the glaring errors in formulae, graphs and general commentary. The presentation is verbose and circumlocutory and to add to the frustration often wrong. I feel obliged to warn potential buyers not to make the same mistake that I have. Gallitz on Financial Engineering is a far more interesting and accurate text and for the rigours of applied financial maths Mastering financial calculations teaches you more in 200 pages than Smithson could in a lifetime of trying to improve on this first edition. If anyone would like my copy of Smithson I'm happy to give it away for fear further sales may encourage McGraw Hill to continue publishing the book."
2,Needs Better Organization,"This book has lots of good information, but it needs better organization. A glossary and a more extensive index would help, but importantly, the author needs to learn to give clear definition at the point at which he introduces a new concept. E.g. there are no references in the index to the different concepts of risk (performance risk, financial price risk, etc.), and where these various concepts are first used there tend to be no introductory and no later (post elaboration) essentializing explanation or definition of the pertinent concept. This is not a book for neophytes to this subject; since I am one, I found it very unwieldy reading."
2,Dated and with plenty of mistakes,"I had to buy this book as it was the text book for one of the subjects that I am studying.Dated: e.g. Many examples that deal with European currencies that were replaced by the Euro.Errors: In the illustrations, there are some calculations that take incorrect parameters to derive the results (obviously yielding wrong results). This is misleading and time consuming.Verbosity: The book explains in twenty pages something that can be explained in five.No good."
3,"Financial Book, not for begineer","The book is written in a complex way. For example, a simple future contract, was explained in long and complex way. It is not able to show the point directly. Anyway, it is not a bad point. It has some quite excellent practical example. It is the most valuable parts of the book."
4,Not a waste of time and money,A good find in a world full of books based on the same subject. Worth spending your time on. Read it and enjoy it.
2,This is unfortunate,"This album should be called ""Unfortunate"" or ""Unforgiveable"". I listened to all the tracks several times, and they just are not in line with Hip-Hop or even sound good. Lyrics are weeeaaakkk. Like one reviewer mentioned, a lyricist and a rapper are two different entities. There are two hot songs on this album:Pullin me BackCadillac DoorThe rest are just...not to be mentioned. This is an album that could really kill a career, as many other artists have suffered one bad cd and you are through. I would suggest to download the previous songs, and leave the rest alone. No hating at all here, but speaking from a true hip-hop fan this does not make the cut."
2,Back in high school,"Chingy is nice on the eyes, but this album is not nice on the ears. Back in high school, I may have bumped this, but listening to a grown man brag about wearing Girbaud, matching outfits, and partying just gets old after awhile. I would expect something like this from maybe Bow-wow, but Chingy is grown, and I wish he'd talk about more relevant issues. I was listening to lines that obviously were not meant to take on the poetic ability of true hip-hop (i.e. Dr. Seuss rhyming--pick the VERY first word that rhymes with the word before and make it a rap). The Chingy groupies will probably think this album is hot and PHYSICALLY he is, but not this album."
1,BOOOOOOOOO!!!!!,"LAAAAME. Is there anything else out there besides cash, cars, and ho's?? Whats the point?? Every rapper before him has done this before and sometimes better then him.This kind of rap just gets old. I could careless about what you have. Its all material stuff that will leave you anyways. Learn from MC Hammer Chingy."
1,"Seriously man, April fools was 6 months ago...","...because releasing this cd HAS to be a f*cking April Fools joke. This blowtard is still around? Are you kidding me? Unbelievable. I don't think it'll be that hard to bring this trash heap to 1 star, just a couple more bad reviews and we'll have it ladies and gents. In fact I think this will hold the record for the FASTEST achieved 1-star average a cd has ever received! Hey at least Chingy accomplished something in his mundane life. He also has the honor of 2nd worst rapper of all time in my 25 worst rappers of all time list I'll make on Amazon. Do I really even have to explain why?"
3,same old thing,"I liked Chingys radio songs, mostly because those are the only good songs from him. If you want good rap go get lord Jamar or lupe fiasco, other than that I just recomend you down load cetain song off this."
1,this album is REALLY REALLY BAD,this album really sucks this clown can't rap who the heck does he think he is an he prolly aint even from the hood y the heck is he releasing an album called Hoodstar???? PS. DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM I DON'T EVEN KNOW Y ANYBODY WOULD SIGN THIS CLOWN.
4,"i liked it, no vomit!","Well i thought it was a good cd! no vomit for me, and as far as iknow i've never vomited from my ears, that was a pretty idiotic metaphor. this isnt the most lyricly sound cd but great if your havin a party and need some hype music up in thurr!"
3,Not bad at all,"as i though it would be. i found a bit more enjoyment out of this cd than Chingy's previous effort Powerballin (which really did suck). I found myself liking a few tracks including Dem Jeans with Jermaine Dupri and Pullin Me Back with Tyrese (easily one of my favorite tracks by Chingy). It uses a sample of ""Rain"" by SWV and it is ever better because Tyrese shows up briefly in the video as well. For me those 2 tracks were enough to give this cd 3 stars and thats what i did.I don't find ""Hoodstar"" to be as bad as people are repping here on Amazon. But that's there own opinion and i've stated mine as well. You might be better off downloading those 2 songs. But for me i'm glad that i decide to check this one out instead of skipping it."
3,A weak Vaughan Williams 5th but Flos Campi is nice,"This is one of the primary recommendations for this symphony in many record guides. Don't expect miracles from Vernon Handley. It's well played and recorded but misses quite a bit of the rapture of the piece, most notably in the slow movement. Another major recommendation is Richard Hickox on Chandos. There is also Andre Previn and the usually inspired John Barbirolli. They are preferable to this version.However a short choral work called Flos Campi and the Oboe Concerto are also part of this CD. Pleasant music captured well, a consolation for the performance of the symphony which is good but not as great as I hoped."
4,Great Album,I received this as a promo somewhere and was surprised what a great album it is. The singer has a cool gravely voice. The lyrics are quite witty. If the music industry wasn't so lame these guys should be big stars.
2,Weird texture and mild sting for me. Prefer the Correcting fluid.,"Why foam? It's kind of messy and smells a little sour. It definitely tingles on application for me which is uncomfortable. A little goes a long way. It seemed to sit on top of my skin without really sinking in. The package is wasteful on this and all the Definity products in terms of the huge hunk of plastic involved. It's an okay moisturiser but it does not hold a candle to the correcting protective lotion in the same line. That one goes on nicer, is in a more familiar form of a lotion pump, does not sting and has sun protection. Gives all the same glucosamine benefits too.Skip this one and get the Definity correcting protective lotion."
5,Works great and helps my makeup stay fresher longer.,"First of all, I don't notice any smell as did one reveiwer. Yes, the texture was new to me but it works great for something that goes on so light. I also noticed that my makeup stays fresher longer, and that my wrinkles are alot less noticable. Being a huge fan of Olay products, I knew that I could trust this, and have not had any irritation whatsoever. It will continue to be part of my morning routine."
2,how was this voted one of the best,"To start off I dont see any improvement in wrinkles, but the worst part is that if you rub your forehead it rubs off and flakes, nasty. It wasnt cheap either. The way it goes on is annoying too."
1,Greasy,"I used this product for 4 days the moisturizer was greasy on my face and I felt like my skin could not breathe, I did not see any difference in my skin due to my time using it but I broke out from it big time. I am very unimpressed with this product."
1,Make in China,"My order is labeled made in China. With all the recent problems with products manufactured in China I am a bit leary about using them. I emailed the seller thru Amazon 3 days ago, asking if this a knock-off product, and they have not responded. That's a good enough answer for me, I will return my order."
5,I Love it!,Very revealing! compelling! Undenying truth! The actresss in this film discussed their journey's in Hollywood with so much conviction that anyone can relate to in some form or fashion. It was brillant!
4,Deplasticizing L.A.,"I found this look into the lives of several women as they navigate the LA acting scene a truly educational experience. Rather than coming off as some bland narrative, the ladies in the film define acting as much a vocation as it is a profession through the mini-bios and in the round interview format of the feature. The mannequinesque portrait some may have of those in the acting profession, is deconstructed as a well rounded view of the family, occupations, and persoonalities that make-up these women is showcased. I was left wanting to continue trailing the footpath of their days.Perhaps that would make a good...Reality Show? *ducks*Just kidding, ladies. Thank you for this revealing look into your worlds."
3,I'll give three stars. . .,". . .to any product that can make the writings of the Church Fathers more readily accessible.But this edition doesn't get more than three! This is an electronic edition of ""The Early Church Fathers"" 38 volume set, edited by Philip Schaff, currently in re-print by a number of vendors. It's entitled ""Protestant Edition"" because it retains the vast number of notes and essays, penned mostly by 19th century Protestant scholars with serious anti-Catholic issues. So it loses one star here. The set loses a second star because it is quite dated. In the last 100 years, better, more scholarly translations have been published -- a fact recognized by Protestant and Catholic scholars alike.NEVERTHELESS, this is a set well worth acquiring; and the electronic search features make research much less time consuming."
3,Public Budgeting Broken Down,David Nice's Public Budgeting is a comprehensive guide that gives the reader a solid overview of the many aspects of budgeting as well as the restraints thereof. I found this book to be particularly helpful to my understanding of what a budget is. I would definitely reccomend this jargon free guide to public budgeting to others. It is an easy read.
2,Another notch in Jack's belt,"Supposedly the purpose of this book is to portray Jack Kennedy as a tender, affectionate young man-- different from the philandering JFK of the tabloids. Then proceeds to tell of a sexual conquest that most respectable women would be ashamed to admit that they fell for. Should have left well enough alone. Out of respect for Jackie, Gunilla waits until after her death, to write the book, however I find it hard to believe that Jack could have written so many love letters and long distance phone calls to her along with all the other women to which he has been linked without her being a little suspicious."
1,Not worth my time,"Absolutely terrible. That's the only way to describe this; terrible. If you're interested in the thinking of a loose woman, then sure, I'd recommend picking up this book (if you can call it that). This was the deliberate endeavor to sabotage a marriage, though in vain. If von Post had any sort of dignity or pride whatsoever, she would not taint the image of the late president by writing about her silly fling. The quintessential romantic may adore this work, quixotic as it may be. Thus, if you display the same idiosyncratic characteristics of this woman--if morose, desperate women don't abhor you--then you may even like this book. What amazes me is the stark contrast between the two women of this triangle. von Post's attack on matrimony is almost tangible via this book."
4,"Not a lot of only Kennedy, but there are enough of those....","There are enough books that are only about the Kennedys or one in particular, so it is refreshing to see a different view point on this Kennedy, JFK. This book is what sparked my interest in John Kennedy (and John Jr. and Jackie) and I am 14, it is hard to create interest in 14 year olds at all and to also hold their attention, and this held mine. The only reason that it doesn't get 5 stars is because it is supposed to basically be about JFK, she put too many details about herself into it."
3,a failure,With this cast and subject this should have been a great movie. Shame it's not even good. Ok at best. For Warren Oates completists only.
1,First effort as a director fails miserably,"""Chandler"" is a film with a terrific cast - Warren Oates, Charles McGraw, Gloria Grahame, Royal Dano, Scatman Crothers, Richard Loo, Mitch Ryan - but it never gets off the ground. Director Paul Magwood (1943) complained that MGM re-cut the film and changed the music, but that's only half the problem. The other problem is that the scenes themselves are dull and lackluster, regardless of how you cut them, and regardless of the heavy handed music score that was not uncommon for early 70s action films.BTW - Magwood was married to co-star Leslie Caron. This was Magwood's first film and only film as a director. His later career was built around work on TV as an assistant director for B TV movies and series (""Nero Wolfe"", Mike Hammer"", ""Father Dowling Mysteries"").Those of you, like me, who love Warren Oates films (""The Wild Bunch"", ""Badlands"", ""Ride the High Country"", ""Dillinger"", ""Bring me the Head of Alfredo Garcia"") will be disappointed."
1,Really Bad Movie,"I wish i would had read Roberts review on this before i bought it. The Movie was bad. the acting, the plot and the direction of this was as if a high school student made this film. not worth the money or your time. if your looking for a good detective movie, this isn't the one."
5,I LOVE PRAYER,"Daniel Henderson is exciting, the reason is, he is a man after God's own heart. He has an incrediable passion for God's Word and and it show in his book Fresh Encounter. Time spent in prayer can be everything Dr. Henderson teaches."
5,"Same performance, much better recording...",This is a great recording of Aida and arguably the best. However the Urania remastering[[ASIN:B003528HE6 Verdi - Aida - Jonel Perlea (2 CD Set)] has significantly better sound and is worth upgrading to.
1,Boring. Boring Woman. Boring Observations. Annoying style.,"5% of this book was interesting. The rest was a combination of the whining insecurity of a horribly boring human female, and boring observations of how the daily trivia of Neanderthal life differs from the daily trivia of our lives.And this book contained an annoying style I have never seen before. The author ends hundreds of sentences and paragraphs with:but--...And yet, there was--and then--and--...If you will...Over and over again, sometimes several times on a page, this leaving the thought hanging writing style is used. It got so annoying in places it almost made the book unreadable. Finally, it was the totality of the annoyances that made the book unreadable.After reading my own review, I downgraded this from 2 stars to 1 star. What a disappointment after Hominids."
5,Great Read,"HUMANS is a solid sequel to HOMINIDS and picks up where the first book left off. I was surprised to read such a well-developed and heart-felt love story written by a man. This novel delves more deeply into the Neanderthal universe when Mary goes to the ""other side"" for a visit. The author, through a preachy Native American scientist, raises more fascinating points about our societal structure that I will be pondering for quite some time. Being too young to remember Vietnam, I was especially fascinated (and amused) by Mary's attempt to explain it to Ponter. Can't wait to read Hybrids, the conclusion to the trilogy."
3,more philosophy than story,"I read the first installment in Analog as a series, and it was interesting enough that bought this second of the series. I was very disappointed, however, with the constant comparison of our human culture and the ""can do no wrong"" neanderthal world. This book is almost all the author's ideas of what is wrong with our world, and very little story line or action. I had to force myself to finish the book, just to be fair to the author. Also, why is it that an author feels he/she has to include graphic and explicit gratuitous sex scenes.? If he feels his story isn't good enough to hold our interest without the explicit sex, then don't write the story in the first place. He makes the neanderthals out to be saints with a perfect eden of a world. I don't believe I will buy or read the next book."
4,Very enjoyable read,"This is the second book of the Neanderthal Parallax trilogy, and I enjoyed it almost as much as the first book, Hominids. This one is as suspenseful and unpredictable as the first book, and I fully recommend it to anyone who has any interested in Sci-Fi or adventure."
3,A Fantastic Read with just one flaw...,"I imensly enjoyed the first installment of this trilogy and looked forward to getting a copy of ""Humans"",It does not disapoint. Anyone with a facination about Anthropology will not be let down by this rip roaring adventure acorss the dimentional divide.HOWEVER, there does appear to be a running theme throughout the book that White Men are the sole cause of all of societys ills.All the major characters(with the exception of the neanderthal) are white women and men of colour, I enjoyed this refreshing twist on things however the non stop negative references toward european based culture and caucasian males are just a little bit ridiculous and over the top and in my mind political correctness run amuck.. otherwise a fab read...!"
4,what it means to be human,Robert Sawyer is an amazing author - I recommend any of his work. The www:wake series gets five stars. One of the cover quotes mentioned his ongoing explorations of what it means to be human .... thought provoking.
4,Hominids,"The premise of this book is very interesting, what if Neanderthals were still living. I admit to being a little lost at times, but Sawyer brought me back to his version of Earth! Read all three books of this trilogy!"
4,Great Read!,"This was every bit as god as Hominids; I can hardlt wait till Hybrids comes out in paperback. I like the Neandertals system of sex separation and responsible breeding, and their acceptance of gay relations. And especially the way they do not overpopulate and respect the Earth. But the sex scenes were a bit graphic and not really necessary to advance the story; which is why I only gave it 4 stars."
4,Pretty Good For The Middle Of A Series...,"This book was, as I said above, pretty good for a mid-series novel. As far as I've ever seen, there's never been a mid-series novel that is very stand alone. Some people seem to think there are, but there just aren't. But as I said, pretty good for mid-series. We're at the point in the story arc, though, where the ideas presented in ""Hominids"" now get to be really poked at. For one, the Neanderthals non belief in a God. One thing that did surprise me, though, was Mary Vaughan's at least to me, sudden super-religiousness (is that a word? Oh well.) In the first one, she didn't seem as... close-minded about it. In this one, she was really like ""There's a God, shut up Ponter."" Anyway, good for mid-series."
3,Again the social commentary..,"Again the social commentary of the book, like in Hominids, judges homo sapiens to be unenlightened, especially males. The Neanderthal society is idealized. An example:""..letting women labor - funny how that word had a double meaning for females, Mary thought - in an environment free of men and their egos.""""..she was beginning to think just about anything was possible - especially if there were no men around.""The majority of this second book in the series revolves around the love relationship of Ponter (Neanderthal) and Mary (sapien), and the interesting parts about science and society are glossed over except when used to point out how inferior our sapien lives are.Despite all this, I'm enjoying the series, and have hopes for the final book, Hybrids, which I just cracked open."
4,species collide,"I found the first two volumes of the 'parallax' series to be quite a lot of fun. Sawyer put a good deal of effort into making his characters just alien enough, yet just endearing enough, for his well-crafted stories to hang together.I had a niggling question about one of his theories, specifically on how the Neanderthal society acted to weed out the potential for crime in the gene pool, and emailed him. Even though this book is several years old, and presumably Sawyer has moved on to other things, I received a carefully considered answer within a few hours! (Sawyer promised me that the answer is in Hybrids, which is next on my list...)"
1,modern talking 1998 \ 1999 Import,I review modern talking video 1998 \1999 Import sou I want now the title and price before I ordered
2,BAD,"I could only read 20 or so pages in this book! It was really bad, but I know that it teaches good morals in the end. It had just too many fights in it!! I have read Chelsea and the Outrageous Phone Bill, and it was great!! I might like to read Kathy's Baby-sitting Hassle, Roxie's Mall Madness, or a Made-over Chelsea, but probably not this book. In this book, Chelsea encounters several tough girls. Can the best friends help her make it through? My sister said she'd never read it, but I said that I would try it. I did, and I couldn't even get through with it!! If you absolutely have to buy this book, then buy it for $1.00 or less! It is not worth any more than that!"
4,Girls Can Be Great,"For anyone who wants to encourage girls to reach for the stars, this book highlights the biographies of certain women leaders we have come to notice and admire. These famous women did not start out as particularly extraordinary, but found their way to greatness along the way. Inspiring like Gutsy Girl and Women Who Rocked the World."
5,The Greatness of Girls,"Susan Strong did a wonderful job with this book. She took the stories of famous women and helped us get to know them on a more personal levelThe introductions to each chapter are beautifully written. My favorite is the intro to Real Realtionships. Strong writes, 'Time spent with a good friend is like sinking into a soft, comfy couch that cushions you in love and support. Your better parts come forward- the ""true you"" emerges.'While the books target audience is girls aged 13-15, I believe EVERY woman can be inspired by it."
5,Educational,"I bought this for my boyfriend, however, I found it very educational. It had the right amount of text and pictures so it's easier for you to follow."
5,One Of My Favorites,"This is one of my favorite books about the United States Marine Corps. I am proud to say that I served with the USMC in the Korean War. I collect books about ""The Corps"" and my wife pleasantly surprised me with this one for Christmas. It is the best I've ever seen covering the entire history of the USMC and the forerunner Continental Marines that we so proudly celebrate the origin of on November 10, 1775 as the date of our beginning."
5,Birthday error,"The Marine Corps was founded in 1775, not 1794. It is the only branch of the service that religously observes it's birthday. It just celebrated it's 230th.Consequently the error in the editorial review will leap out at any Marine or former Marine."
5,Semper Fi,"This book was placed in our local library in memory of Staff Sergeant William J. Daniels, United States Marine Corps.(Ret.). It is the best book I have ever seen on the Marine Corps and proud to have placed it there in his honor.Signed: Robert Morgan"
4,A review of Mirage,"Mirage is not Gregory Peck's best film, but it is well done and suspenseful, well-set and well cast. The plot gets a bit strained here and there because of weak cameo performances by Matthau as Ted Casselle and by the actor who plays ""The Major"" but as usual, Peck's performance is strong enough to sustain the dramatic line when it falters. I enjoy it every time I see it and recommend it."
3,Re-release of a mediocre movie,"This was one of five or six Peck films released a couple years ago as individual discs in a boxed set. It wasn't a keeper then, and, unless there are some really fascinating extras on this reissue (although I can't imagine what they would be) it's not going to be a keeper now."
1,defective product,"The movie is very good, having seen it the first time, but the DVD was defective and I don't know how to return it, having lost the packing slip. When attempting to show it, I only get an error message telling me that the DVD was not properly recorded or copied."
4,A Solid Film,"Like the superior ""Captain Newman, MD"" and ""Arabesque,"" ""Mirage"" was previously released only as part of a Gregory Peck collection. It has now been released separately. This black and white thriller was filmed on location in NYC in 1965. (As someone who lives in New York and works in Manhattan, I always enjoy seeing the differences between the city then and the city now.) Peck is an amnesiac wandering the streets and chased by various nefarious characters. He is assisted by the beautiful and classy Diane Baker and a private-eye in a scene-stealing performance by Walter Matthau. Other supporting cast members include Kevin McCarthy and George Kennedy. As someone mentioned the plot is similar to the inferior ""Mister Buddwing"" released a year later with James Garner in the amnesiac role.""Mirage"" is not a great film and the plot is a made-for-tv variety. Still it is suspenseful and has its moments. And like ""Breakfat at Tiffanys,"" it is a nice look at New York City in the early 1960s."
4,When the DVD?,"This is one of those suspense movies that also has something to say. ""If you not willing to commit, you're just taking up space."" On top of that, I've always had a crush on Diane Baker. On top of that, the acting is great. So where the's DVD????"
4,Release on DVD Please,A great thriller from the 1960s but a film that is more like the film noir genre of the 1950s. The black and white cinematography adds to the suspense and I'm glad they decided to film in b&w; rather than the color being used more often in the early 1960s. Solid understated performance from Peck. And a great quirky performance from Walter Matthau as a Private Investigator.I have it taped from many years ago from when AMC used to play classics. The tape is breaking down. Please bring on the dvd.
5,This books is an excellent example for Children and ADULTS!!,What a heart-warming story for the young and young-at-heart! The world would be a better place if more people followed the advice given by this author!
5,Wonderful Book!,My aunt gave this to my daughter (Emma) for her Christening when she was a few months old. We read it to her then and now that she is two she requests it every night. She LOVES it and it easily leads into an understandable discussion of God many nights. Definitely one of her favorites and ours too!
1,"Cute anecdotes about people, little to nothing about ""Underground Technology""","If you're interested in information about ""Catapults, Pulsejets, Rail Guns..."" just Google the word, and you'll get far more information than this book contains...even in its ""The technology of..."" sections. If your current technology knowledge base doesn't exceed what is contained in this book, you've been living under a rock.So what's in this book? Stories of people who had their rockets explode upon takeoff, who lost their fingers building contraptions, and a gratuitous section on how a penis pump works. Wow. What a technology adventure.Why was this book written? In hopes of having schleps part with their money. Don't."
3,Misleading web page,"I must admit I was disappointed with one aspect of the book: the web page from which I ordered it showed a number of color photos of items that I expected to be in the book - leading me to believe these photos were excerpted from the book: but the book had no photos - only a few drawings. A large part of my motivation for purchasing the book was to see pictures of some of the items discussed.The book was fairly interesting, but there are no photos in it."
1,A RATHER DISAPPOINTING PUBLICATION.,"Nothing technical in this book. More about the development and use of different items made by others. Lacking pictures, plans, etc.Okay reading but not much to be learned about tinkering or making your own projects come to life."
5,Great Intro to Alternative Science Projects!,"Bill Gurtelle's latest book is a great intro to several fringe science & engineering contests & hobbies. It's a good read, without getting into too much technical detail (the Further Reading section @ the end leads you to sources for more details on the topics you liked reading about). Pick it up if you're a tinkerer, a hacker, or want to find something non-frumpy to do with your engineering degree! :]"
4,A lovely rendition,"While not a stellar version of swan lake, this was a lovely rendition that is gently mellow and perfect for studying or reading."
3,"Not manufactured to precision standards, but solid once assembled","First of all, the product details above say it holds 156 DVDs, but that's a misprint; it should actually say 165 DVDs. So, hooray, that's 9 more DVDs!This product needs to be assembled, and is similar to assembling Ikea furniture. The only tool you need is a phillips screwdriver. It took me about an hour to do.The pieces could stand to be more consistently manufactured. Some holes were misaligned, some holes were bigger than others, and some of the dividers slide more easily along the metal rods than others. The pieces themselves seem to be uniformly sized, so it's basically just a problem with the hole drilling process. But this did not prevent me from successfully assembling the product, and, once assembled, I found it to be quite solid and sturdy. (Perhaps the other reviewer got a defective one.)"
5,A perfect gift,We chose this charming book to give to parents when their infants are baptized at our church. They love the book and enjoy sharing it with their children for many years.
2,Prayers a little too long for a toddler,I know the book is titled Baby's First Prayers. These prayers are nice for a parent to read to the baby/toddler. I was looking for something that a toddler could memorize with just a short sentence or two per prayer.
2,Not what I was expecting,"This is sort of cute, but not really what I was expecting. Its not like a child so young can do a daily devotional. I was looking for something that I could read to her daily, but this is not as child friendly as I would have wanted. I think a few simple beginner prayers with better illustrations would have been more effective. If I had seen this in person, I would have passed. I guess it might make a cute gift for a baptism etc, but is not going to be really useful for the child until they are much older unfortunately. There are better children's christian books out there."
4,"Cute, but too small","Got this for my friend's baby. Thought it would be standard book size, but turned out to be a lot smaller than that. But considering that it is for babies and small kids, maybe it was meant to be that small. The contents are cute, so overall it is a pretty cute little gift if you are looking for one."
4,Usable resistor box,"I purchased 10 of the RS500 for a test setup. Out of these one had a bad internal solder joint (easily fixed). Given the price, they otherwise work acceptably. One should note that although the range starts at 1 ohm, there is a basic resistance of 0.2-0.5 ohm which varies making the accuracy of the low ohm resistors less then advertised.It also should be noted that the alignment of the plastic and the switches is poor in some places leading to some difficulty in being able to quickly look at the switches and verify their on/off condition.All that said, the substitution box served well with a bit of care in its use and an understanding of its limits."
4,Good Christmas Intro,"This adorable book is a very good introduction to the reason we celebrate Christmas. The short, rhyming phrases on each page and beautiful illustrations are sure to capture your little one's interest. I would give it 5 stars except that for a board book it is a little flimsy. My one year old will sit and listen to it several times in a row, and loves to point at the shiny star and different animals in the pictures. If you are looking for a Christmas story for a little one, this is a good choice!"
3,NO Joseph!,"This book could be adorable. There are quick rhymes on each page which will be perfect for my grandson who doesn't like to spend much time on one page. Each page has a person or animal of the manger scene. Oddly, Joseph doesn't have a page. If the author republished it with a Joseph page it would be perfect."
3,Not what I expected,"This book is pretty to look at, but to me, it doesn't really tell the story of Christmas. It is better for the little ones that already understand the Christmas concept. My 2 year old, however, enjoys me reading it, not for the words, but for the pretty pictures."
2,too simple,"I bought this book with the thoughts of giving to my neices and nepews for Christmas to have a book to read about the birth of Jesus and what Christmas is really about. Now they range in age from 1-8 so I kind of wanted something easy however, this book does not teaach the meaning it tells you at the end I am jesus the new born baby something like that. I would buy the baby jesus is born feel n touch I did after I got this one and saw it would not do what I wanted to do for the precious ones."
5,Great first Christmas gift for little ones!,"My youngest son received this book for his first Christmas, and he loved it. It became one of his favorites that we read all the time not just at Christmas. It tells the Christmas story in simple word rhyme and pictures. I bought this book for all my grandchildren's first Christmas."
5,just right,This simple board book was perfect for my 17-month-old and was a great age-appropriate introduction to the nativity story. I'm glad we got it and look forward to reading it with him again next year.
4,My daughter LOVES this,"We got a nativity set last year so I bought this book to help her figure out who the ""players"" were. She has not stopped having me read it all year long. She simply loves its easy to hold size and cute pictures. She is capitavated by the two pages with the baby in them. I'm so glad I got this book, it was meant for christmas but it has been a year-round delight."
4,indie pop at its best,"first off, i cant give this a 5 only because their first lp is better, and im hoping for an even better follow up to this one. track star is the best band in the world. people who say they are boring are probably listening to the ultra complicated, over produced, ultra mega superstar intellectual progressive blahblahblah. track star is not that. its pop songs, but theyre the best pop songs. they're straightforward, theyre honest, and theyre clean. if you want 2002's The Dark Side of the Moon, go get a sigar ros album or something. if you want 2002's Meet the Beatles, here it is."
3,Booklet-God's Creative Power Will Work for You,"I expected this to be a small book, but instead it was more like a pamphlet. It is 3""x5"" and only 27 pages. the book did arrive quickly because it was in a regular greeting card size envelope. Also, it was new and not damaged in shipping."
2,Good but not as good as I've seen on DirectTV,Live and Loose in Paris was okay; but not as good as two years ago when I saw him on a DIRECTV special.
3,What a waste of one of the world's greatest drummers,"Anybody who knows early Genesis, or Genesis live, knows how good Collins is behind the drum kit. A fellow drummer, I have followed Genesis for years and find it almost criminal that such a great drummer can churn out such average 'chewing gum for the ears' as exists on this DVD. I saw this tour in Manchester, England, and all but about 10-15 minutes of drum work was terrible commercial trivia. What a waste of talent.Buy it if you like 'One More Night' and other songs to get depressed by. Alas, Genesis are no more. I'm glad Hackett and Gabriel haven't lost it completely."
1,A real let down!,"Easily the worst album and worst tour to date for Phil Collins. This concert lacks something big .... Chester Thompson. With that aside, Phil's determination to venture out to other musical styles has hurt his music as a whole."
5,AWSOME CONCERT!!!!!!,"If you are a Phil Collins fan you'll love this video. It is a live concert of most of his hits, and the people in his band are incredible. Its worth every penny!!!!"
2,"Agreed, not white","The quality of the paper is great, but definitely not white - it is much warmer. As this was purchased for product photography, it is unusable for my purposes. I also wish they had made this clear."
3,I wouldn't call it white...,"The roll comes with lots of pros and a con...Pros:Very light-weight. Makes carrying it w/ all the other equipment easy.Length is small enough to fit in the trunk of any vehicle.It's thick so light/flash doesn't go thru it.Cons:It's not the color of the picture. In fact, I wouldn't even call it white. It's more of a light cream color.All in all, I really like it. Just wish I had known it wasn't white-white."
5,The American Boy,"This book is abseloutly perfect....Bob Lamb's pictures are true ART, and the kids themselves are also verynice looking boys,.It reflects a American Boy's life, Youth, and things they do, and love to ""be"",...The comments in the book are as real as Life tiself....Thank you Amazon.com for selling such a Beautifull piece of ART...Sorry for my English cause i'm a French speaking CanadianMerciThank YouYves Guay Montreal,Qc Canada."
1,outrageous,"this book tries to shock you and thats all. a sex scene with God? a sex scene with a starfish? this book is all sex, and the plot is secondary. The last scene of the book is so grotesque, you're wondering what this author was on when he wrote it. This book is much too long (400 pages!!) for what it delivers, i suggest staying away from this ... trashy romance ""novel"" ..."
1,Stupid,"This book makes the impossible, possible. Sex becomes boring for the first time ever in this unsavory novel of little thrills, little excitement, and tons of stupid dialogue. ""Wide Asleep"" is a book to end someone's career, too bad this is the kid's first real novel."
2,WHERE'S THE ENDING????????????,"After all that plot, all those twists, all those surprises, all that sex, and more and more sex, I was hoping for a fairly decent ending. Unfortunately, this book comes without one. At first I thought my copy was missing pages, but nope, it sounds like everyone's stopped at that completely obscene ""conclusion,"" and I use that word sparingly."
2,"Very imaginative, though...","Lots of imagination went into this and it is clearly evident. The author incorporates many beautiful images and lots of really well-crafted poetry. Lots and lots of explicit, hard-core sex that borders on the pornographic, at times, takes away from the story and strangely makes the reading very boring."
4,"Forget the previous reviews, this book was great!","What did all you previous reviewers expect? It says it right on the back cover: SCORCHING EROTIC ENCOUNTERS, what the heck do you think that means? Besides that, you have to hand it to the kid, he's 18! How many eighteen year olds can say they have a gorgeously titilating full-length novel under their belt? Not many. What I read was a poetic, often beautiful tale of marital and extramarital obsession, and the danger of jealousy in the stronghold of a relationship. Yes, the book is very steamy, steamier than anything I've read in years, and I'm sure this kid is having the time of his life, it clearly shows in his work. Give it a try. I'm sure this is what the publisher wanted to do; to tease you with a piece of wild literature that older writers wouldn't dare attempt to construct. Jim D'Aniello has a gift and I'm sure we'll hear his name in the near future."
4,Aqua Globes review,"We have used before, very useful. A little awkward to fill and the tube is fragile. The tube can fill with dirt if you do not make a channel in the dirt before you push it in"
3,Works,"This product really does work, the thing I dont like about it is how hard it is to fill up. You do save time because you dont have to water as often but getting water into the globe is a huge task itself. Other then that the product does work and they look pretty :)"
4,Mostly works,"I had to be out of the house for 2 weeks, so I bought globes for my house plants. They helped the plants survive for that period. My only reservation is that not all globes worked -- some did not release any of the water they contained. I think the problem is that it depends on how much soil gets into the tube. Too much soil probably plugs the opening, but it's hard to tell how much is too much.To be safe, you might want to put 2 globes per plant. That way, if one doesn't release water, the other could keep the plant safe."
1,these globes were rejects,"I've bought globes before, but from a different vendor, and I loved them! However, these appear to be seconds or rejects because the stems were super narrow. That makes it extremely time consuming and nearly impossible to fill the globes. Kind of defeats the whole idea of having a time saving watering system!"
3,A Couple of Quirks...but they work,"I bought six of these to water my large potted plants while we are gone in the summer. Once receiving them, I immediately tried them. I filled them with water, made the hole in the dirt first with something else, and inserted the globes. Water started leaving the globes quickly and within 10-15 minutes, the globes were empty! I was hoping water would stay in the globes long enough to water the plants for at least one week, and they were empty. I soon realized that your plants have to be saturated with water FIRST, then as the dirt around the globes dries, water is released from the globe. Another thing, dirt does get trapped in the stem sometimes. Overall, just make sure that your plants are watered very well before you insert the globes, then they will slowly release the water the plant needs. I've had comments on how pretty they are in the plants also. I think they do the job without having to ask your neighbor to come water your plants while you're gone."
1,Aqua Globes,The aqua globes are an attractive addition to my plants but they require very exact repeated attempts at placement. The stems of the globes tend to fill up with soil from the pot and create a barrier so that no water trickles out to keep the plant at the right level of moisture.
1,Not effective,"I purchased these for a plant that I often forget to water. Unfortunately, they're not effective. When I checked the plant a week after inserting the globes, I found the soil to be dry, and the globes to still be full of water. Soil had clogged the spout, preventing the water from coming out. Removing the impacted soil wasn't easy, and no amount of repositioning once it was cleared prevented it from happening again. They look pretty, but didn't serve their purpose."
2,cute but no so useful,"The main problem is inconsistency in the diameter of the tube. Some are so thin that water don't come out even if you leave them in the air. Some other aro so big that the water get depleted over night. So, they look pretty nice, but are pretty useless if you are looking for something that you can trust when you go away"
3,Good but not Great,Your better off purchasing these at a store if you can find them. The stems make all the difference. One of mine had a very narrow stem..
2,Not Great,"These globes do not hold enough water to water even the smallest of my potted plants for one day, let alone for two weeks. I suppose they would work fine if it rained during that period, but otherwise, do not purchase."
5,They Work!,"Bought these as I was tired of coming home from a week or so vacation and having dead houseplants. We placed in plants from 6"" to 12"" and were gone for 11 days. When we got back, some of the bulbs were dry--but all of the plants looked great and have survived just fine (been back a month now). Any longer of a trip, and I wonder if some of the bigger plants might suffer...?Anyway, I did poke a hole (using a dowel) in the soil before inserting the globes--per the instructions. Not sure if this is necessary but the reasoning is to prevent the globe-stems from getting clogged."
3,Not as wonderful...,"The water globes are not as I expected. The ""tube"" gets clogged with dirt and no water gets out to the plant... I bought 3 sets, I have only used 2 sets"
3,A bit disappointed,"This globe didn't work well for me. First of all, it's too heavy for my small plant pod to stay up. Second, the soil jams the waterway, and the amount of water going down is minimal. It may work with some more careful preparation though. So I'll try again before I leave for my week long vacation."
4,"Smaller than when bought at CVS, but very pretty",These globes do the job. I use two of them for a large plant. My plants are out in the Florida heat/sun so I fill up the globes daily and they keep my vines flowering beautifully.
2,"look pretty, maybe I did them wrong?",I like how they look in the plants. But mine kept getting clogged when I put them in. My plant got dryer and dryer and the water still stayed in the bulb... Maybe I didn't dig the hole deep enough? I've already thrown out those flowers so if I get some new ones I will try digging the hole deeper to see if they work that way. Hard to get the dirt out once it clogs.
2,Too fast,Put this in my plant and the globe was empty in about 1 1/2 hours. Needs to come with a cork or something to slow the water down.
1,Aqua globes,"They do not tell you that for all but the smallest plants you. Need two globes. I did not find that they kept my plants watered as I had hoped. I still have to water my inpatients. They don't do anything for the ferns. Also, in spite of making a hole for the stem, they still got clogged with dirt. I wouldn't buy them again."
2,Aqua Globes,"I ordered 3 packs of Aqua Globes. I didn't unpack them until I was ready to use them (I was going out of town and wanted my plants watered while gone). None of the boxes was damaged, but one of the pair in a box was broken. No glass was in the box but the stem of the globe was about 2"" shorter than the other one and it was ragged at the end which indicated to me that it wasn't made that way. One of another pair, the stem is so narrow that it is almost impossible to get water into it."
2,Don't work very well,"I purchased these to water some window boxes. I filled the globes and inserted them into the planter boxes as the directions stated. Withing a few hours all were empty. I needed these for watering while away. But the water emptied out before I even left. Product looks nice, but doesn't work as expected."
1,worthless.,"I got these as a Christmas present and was excited to try them out in my houseplants. The first thing I noticed that even without water, they are heavy. So once you add the water to them they weigh a lot more than you would think. I tried them in several average sized pots (just like they show in the commercial) and they were so heavy that the pots kept tipping over. Also the ends were constantly getting clogged. It's just much more efficient if I water my plants myself. I'm just glad that I didn't spend any money on these because they were a complete waste!"
2,Didn't seem to work,I bought these for when I went on vacation. I couldn't get them to work. The water would drain out of them immediately. Or dirt would get stuck in them. Eventually they shattered.
2,minimally useful,"if you do these things just right they drip gradually, but still don't water as consistently and for as long as the hydrospikes. they are prettier, but more work than is worth it"
2,Watering Balls Review,I sent the product back! They're very nice looking but I live in a windy area and I was going to use them in my hanging plants outside and I was afraid they would break.
2,ONLY Medium size pots with low water requirements,"If the pot is too small it will tip over. If the pot is too big these will not do any good for any duration (too small=baseball sized). Ideal for a 6"" pot. A better design would have an open top so you can refill without removal. Everytime you place it you have to make sure you don't plug with dirt or it won't work right. The glass bulbs are very pretty, but they don't hold much water. Forget about using these for being gone on vacation, unless your plant requires very little water. We lost several plants in just 1 week."
1,Aqua globes don't work well,"You need to have a large enough potted plant for the Aqua Globe to stay upright. If you can't stick it in deep enough it falls over. I had problems with it getting clogged with soil. Even for the one plant, I was able to use it in, I didn't notice that I had to water the plant less then I normally did. I also didn't like how it looked in the potted plant. I felt it detracted from the plant's appearance. My Aqua Globes are all under my bed now. I'll sell them at a yard sale someday."
1,overwatered and killed my plants,the first day I got this and put it in my planter. it went through a whole serving of water. my bf filled it up again a few days later and the same thing happened. Soon mold was growing at the base of my plant. It eventually turned brown and flopped right over. Waste of money. I bought the ceramic cones and they are a million times better.
5,Great Product,The aqua globes work great. I put them into my plants before we left for a two week vacation. When I came back they were completely empty but the plants were fine. For larger plants I would definitely recommend putting two in before you leave.
4,Works pretty well,"I love how pretty these bulbs are, but they are also quite useful. I have four of them, two for indoor plants and two for outdoor plants that are in an awkward, hard to water spot in my garden. They seem to keep the plants adequately watered, sometimes for up to two weeks depending on weather conditions. My one complaint is that it is really hard for me to trickle water in to fill them up. If the hose is on too heavy water just splashes and doesn't fill the bulb. I've also tried dunking them in a bucket of water to fill, but this is slow to fill also, I think just due to the narrow aperture of the stem. Overall I'm very happy with these and intend to get more."
3,water globes,They don't stay filled as long as claimed. Buying them has not made it any more convenient for me or improved my green thumb.
5,Glad I didn't read the other reivews first...,"Typically I am very affected by negative reviews. I'm glad I never read all the bad reivews because I've had great luck with these and so has my my mom. I would say that the surface of the plant is wet, but I guess the roots are damp enough with this because my plants are doing very well on them. Great for high baskets because I don't have to constantly climb on our counter to water them."
3,Not worth buying online,"I was about to buy this item since it is at a great price, but watch that shipping cost. This one does not qualify for a super-saver and the shipping was going to cost over twice the amount of the item I was about to order. That's an instant deal killer for me. One would be better off just buying it locally."
2,Clogs with dirt!,Was given to me by my sister as a birthday gift and while beautiful these globes just don't cut it. I have tried it in several plants and the little tube always gets clogged with dirt. I have tried waiting to see if eventually the dirt would get moist enough to release the rest of the water but my plants started wilting and I didn't want to risk it. Does make for a pretty decoration though.
1,Not good,"The watering balls did not work at all for me. I tried them in several different pots with no luck. The only time my plants were watered is when I lifted the balls out of the dirt. I had hoped that at least they would be decorations in the pots, put they are very heavy."
4,satisfied,"I bought these after my sister-in-law talked my ear off about how well they worked for her orchids. I had two ferns hanging from my front porch that seemed to dry out constantly. The bulbs worked great, better than normal watering. The bulbs lasted two days and kept the ferns greener than watering from the top. I learned two things my first season with the bulbs that could help others. Put the bulbs back in the same hole everytime. This causes less damage to the roots and less clogging to you bulbs. Take your planters down when the winds blowing, the bulbs tend to break when the plants fall :)"
2,Ehhh...,"To start, these things are very pretty, the hand blown patterns are very unique from bulb to bulb. However since they're hand blown not only are each of them different in color patterns but also in the thickness of the stem inside. The pack I had ordered came with one normal sized stem and the other came with a stem that was near impossible to ""easily fill"" unless I trickled water down into the bulb VERY slowly. I suppose they watered well enough but the amount of water used seems more or less proportionate to the density of your soil so if you have your plants newly potted then they might consume water(or waste, I honestly couldn't tell) in about a day. I recommend this only as a cheapass alternative to asking a friend to come over to water your plants when you're away."
1,WAAAAYYY TOO Expensive...,"Go to Walmart (even if you hate it) and get one of these globes for $0.98!!!!!!!!!!! If you want to stick it to the man, then donate what you saved to some non-profit that opposes Walmart... but I love it."
2,Pretty but useless,"I followed the instructions faithfully. I didn't have the problem some people mentioned of the bulb getting plugged, that's fairly easy to take care of with a large unfolded paper clip. My problem is that these don't really do the trick. Unless you pre-water your plant every time, they are useless...so you can't use them to water your plants or trust them when you are gone. 2 weeks? That's a joke. Also one might not be enough for the plant, even a small one. A pot with a drain will lose all the water overnight. Pretty but useless unless the weather is cool enough to prevent evaporation."
2,look nice but not practical,"I have a 7' banana tree in a pot and need two aqua globes. With the globes, I replenish the water about every 3 days. The slender tube is too narrow that dirt is lodged in the shaft. To loosen the dirt before I could refill it with water, I cut a section of wire from a metal hanger. This was alot of work so I switched to a watering spike (with clay casing) and use a 25 fl. oz. bottle and that works better. I can go about a week before filling the bottle but the best part is, I don't have to dislodge dirt... the clay casing remains in the soil and I just refill the bottle."
3,"good, but Wine Bottle Plant Nanny Much better","I picked a couple of these up thinking they are pretty and if they do what I need then it will make keeping my plants watered during the summer easier. They work okay, but it is really easy to get dirt clogged in the thin stem. Also they don't hold a lot of water, and are very delicate/breakable.I was in our local gardening store and found6451 Wine Bottle Plant Nanny Stakes -- Three 4-packs, which are a ceramic base and you stick a wine bottle filled with water into the base. These were wonderfully. Plus wine bottles are easier to deal with including filling, carrying and such."
2,Looks pretty but doesn't work,"I followed the directions closely but have found that these do not perform as advertised. Soil does get clogged inside the globe but that seems normal and unavoidable given the design. I fill it up with water and it quickly drains out. I filled it again and the same thing happened. So, this product does water plants but not any better than you pouring the water in yourself. But I will give it good marks for its appearance. I think it looks beautiful and at this point that is the only reason I keep it on my plant."
4,Aqua watering bulbs,"Very attractive and very convenient solution to watering a large indoor tree. Because the tree I purchased them for is so large, I need to use both bulbs. So far they appear to be doing their job nicely."
4,for my mother,"my mother loved them , she said if see new how to run a computer, she would order things all the time, thank you for making her happy"
2,does not work,"doesn't work for my potted plants, most died from not enough water in 2 weeks. Came back to life when i started to water them myself."
3,Aqua globes,It's hard to tell whether the aqua globes work when the soil keeps getting stuck in the tube. I wish there was an easy way to fill them up.
1,Poorly made,"I have purchased this aqua globes before. Most of the time they are really great at keeping your plants watered, but the openings on these that I ordered on Amazon.com were so tiny that it was almost impossible to fill them with water and once I did manage to get one filled it would not drain into the plant. These were very unlike the ones I purchased in the store. I will not order them online again. I still want two aqua globes but I will wait until I can find them in a store so I can check the opening to make sure they can be properly and easily filled with water."
2,Disappointed,"Disappointed in the watering of our potted plants. Perhaps they were to large for the product to work, but even the smaller plants were not maintained as the product described. They do look pretty though!"
2,Pretty but Not worth the Money. Unfortunately.,"These look so pretty in the pot but what I find happens is no matter how I tried, dirt and little pebbles would get into the tube and stop the water from leeching into the soil like it was designed to do. Great concept, unfortunately I didn't find that it worked well. Pretty though!"
4,MARRIAGE FARCE,"An incredibly fun picture to watch, it's even more fascinating for the fact that Sullavan and Fonda made this picture right after they divorced each other in real life! In this bright romp, Maggie's a movie star and Hank's a writer of high adventure; both use pseudonyms for their respective careers and they meet using their real names and marry not knowing that the other is famous! On their honeymoon, Sullavan wears perfume to which Hank is highly allergic and thus you get the gist of this merry screwball flick. Beulah Bondi scores as Fonda's secretary and the always fun hatchet-faced Hamilton is Mitty in the roominghouse scene."
5,Peach Power!!!!,"This book is the third in the Manga series of Peach Girl. Sae, Momo's supposed friend, is finally ratted out for her sneaky ways. All the lies that Sae said about Momo are finally seen by Toji( Momo's ex-boyfriend) and now Toji, realizing his mistake, wants to get back with Momo, but will Momo want to get back together? That's just some of the drama that goes on in this series. If your new to the series, you should get the first volume, otherwise your missing a great story, and secondly, you would be missing quite a bit of dialogue. The artwork is different, but still gorgeous, I would rank it up there with Sailor Moon. This series kind of reminds me of the older 90210 show(but a lot better, and not as mature). So if your kind of tired of all the magical Manga, and just want to read something a little more realistic. THIS IS THE SERIES TO GET!!! Trust me, you won't regret it."
5,And so the plot thickens...,"Great! Toji finally gets a clue, Kiley finally gets a hug, and Sae finally gets her comeuppance! It didn't quite satisfy my lust for vengeance, because Momo really does get terribly abused and I feel Sae should at least be hit by a truck, but there you have it. I also feel some crueler punishment for Toji is in order, as I harbor a deep grudge against him for his previous actions in books 1 and 2, but we'll see how it goes in book 4. Tantalizing and full of poignant moments, as well as some funny ones."
4,Excellent Book. The Publishing company however...,"I bought Peach girl 3 after getting completely addicted by the first two books. Boy was I surprised when I opened the box. While the story remains intact, and it is a wonderful story at that (I think I'm rooting for Kiley now.) Mixx (sometimes known as Tokyopop) has apparently become a very stingy publisher. The cover was extremely flimsy and the pages are printed on paper that I would venture to say is barely above newsprint quality. And they are still charging the same price as when they were using the high quality papers. Someone needs to remind Mixx that quality is just as important as quantity."
5,Amba,"I have experiece with this product from Middle East where I com from.I just love the taste of it. I put it on ham,some Middle Eastern food,or even it with some diced tomatos,MMMMMMMMM it's great.Thank you for carrying this item, because I don't have a car, and the product is not carried everywhere.Thank you"
2,poor quality,"What can I say. I feel the only redeeming quality of this product is that the motor seems strong and runs quiet. The cable that opens and closes the feed is to flimsy. And last but not least, the media kept getting clogged inside the hopper. Probably would spend a little more money next time and get a better quality product."
4,"FINALLY, PART TWO!","I wholeheartely agree with the first reviewer. In these days of ""politically correct histories."" It was very enjoyable to read an author who refuses to join the inane ranks of revisionist twisters of the facts that we have!At 144 pages it could have been longer. However, Mr. Simon reviews the 18th century creation of ""the Celtic World."" He shows that Minority Nationalism led by self annointed scholars like George Buchanan and William Stuckley, twisted history into a false knot by peoples being oppressed by the British Empire and turned into Celtic Studies. Which lumps many diverse groups under the term Celtic. There is no archaeological evidence whatsoever of any massive Celtic invasion to the British Isles. As the author stated-""kings created peoples, not peoples kings."" Well done."
1,"celts, slavs, etc.","The Celtic language group is one among several in the Indo-European family of languages. The Celts of Europe are as much a group as the Slavs, the Germanic peoples, the Romance language speakers, etc., contemporary cultural differences between Croats and Serbs, Bretons and Scottish Highlanders, or what have you, notwithstanding."
5,More than a movie...,"This was the best movie I have ever seen, period. It mad me laugh and cry, it made me feel crazy with emotion. It reminded me of everything insane and uncertain about life. I loved it. Thank you so much to those who made this movie, it will forever be one of the best films I have ever seen."
5,Have been looking for it on DVD!!,Love this movie and have been looking for it on dvd now for ten years!! I believe it is time. More people need to see this.
3,Not sure what I thought of this movie,"I appreciate the last poster's comment that Marcy suffered from other disorders besides Tourette's. That was the main problem I had with the movie- she portrayed the Tourette's part quite well but some of the behavior was so NOT Tourette's and I didn't feel that the movie even tried to clarify that. I'm sure many people walk away from this film thinking that people with TS have no control over themselves and that they are dangerous to others. Nothing could be further from the truth.I never quite understood what Henry Thomas's character's story was, either. I absolutely loved the old man, though. But what was with the letter to him at the end?I'm not sure whether I recommend this movie or not. There are many other movies out there that portray TS as well or better than this one does, without misleading behaviors thrown in. The Tic Code, Maze, and Dirty Filthy Love are some good ones to see."
1,I agree with Maltin all the way..,"this movie was totally bizarre, i did barely manage to make it through the whole thing. robin tunney was really good but this story just doesn't fly...."
2,Meh.,"I recently discovered Madeline Hunter; I find her hit and miss - By Arrangement was very good, The Rules of Seduction a waste of paper I could not be bother to finish. The Romantic is a clear example of her good writing and thoughtful plotting and details, but it's a fundamentally boring story. Penelope is sweet and it seems not much else as I can't name a single other thing about her two days after finishing the book. She has a terrible husband, has proto-feminist desires for marital equality, then eagerly consents to a marriage under the same yoke of ownership and dependence, although since Julian is a good guy I guess it's okay to participate in an institution she (only hours ago) abhorred. Yawn. The ending was a deus ex machina that tied everything up nice and pat, also very boring in a story that attempts to be compelling. When I find a good book I can't put it down; this book has dozens of pages folded over from where I stopped because I had more interesting things to do."
3,I was disappointed,"This book sounded so wonderful--and indeed, Julian is wonderful. I love his quiet, enigmatic, never-ruffled demeanor hides such depth. Sigh. That he loved Pen so devotedly for so long... But I was never quite sure why he never declared himself before she married. Maybe I just don't remember.Pen on the other hand... I just was never crazy about her. I thought she took Julian for granted and was very blind regarding his feelings for her (yes, he did a great job of hiding them, but I thought she should have sensed something, especially after they'd been intimate).The story is often very dark--not something I expected. But I loved Julian's mental letters to people. Overall though, I expected more."
3,Acceptable quality,"This item arrived with small scuffs/imperfections on one side. However, considering the price it was pretty much what I expected."
2,Could have been great.,"I bought this bag as a gift for someone and when i received it, the initial look of the bag was great. The smell was great, smelled like real leather, and it looked nice. I then looked closer and noticed that there were parts of the leather that were scuffed or imperfections (3 scuff marks in all), it made the bag look used.Because it was a gift, there was no way i could give it like that and i had no time to get a replacement, so i returned it and got a refund. It was a disappointing thing because i was planning on this being the gfit and that was that. Instead i had to figure something else out.Saying this, i would attempt to buy from this seller again, because it just could be that i got a random ""bad one"", seeing as all other reviewers gave it great reviews. I also got refunded with postage, no problems."
5,Nice Little Travel Bag,"It's a nice leather travel bag. It feels like it's built well, durable and strong. The leather is soft. And so far all the major components of the bag are working great; zippers, handle, etc. The one thing I'm not too crazy about is the design of the leather, it's all black leather (which I like), but it's a bunch of pieces of leather sown together to create the design of the bag. And it's not a deal breaker, but I would of preferred a smooth, no design bag.But for the price, you cant go wrong. I would recommend this bag"
3,It's okay,"I wish the hook was bigger. It doesn't slide on the bar very well. Otherwise, it is great and will serve the purpose well."
3,Closet Organizer,Not what I expected them to be they are ok. I was looking for something more sturdy and they are not that sturdy.
2,Tastes like the packaging it comes in,"Well I guess in Brazil you can label something 100% Pure Coconut Water. This trash tastes like cardboard packaging, and sugar and vitamin C added? I am sorry, that is not 100%. I was not expecting real coconut milk, I understand it has to be pasteurized and processed to an extent. I love fresh coconut milk, I have a machete to cut the top off a coconut. However I live in the DC Metro and fresh coconuts are not exactly cheap. I just thought this would be a good, quick reminder of the real thing to drink on the go and not a can of soda. They picture this with a straw, it comes with no straws. Not happy with this purchase, and I question the safety of the product, obviously highly processed in some ""factory"". I really do not understand where the 5 star ratings are coming from on this product. I love Amazon, they should not sell trash like this."
1,Worst Coconut Water on the market,"I am very surprised that this Coco water has such high ratings. Since it is on sale all the time, I feel obligated to warn my fellow coco water loving bargain hunters that this stuff is NASTY! I love Coco water and enjoy drinking ONE, Amy & Brian's, even Zico is pretty good... this stuff doesn't taste like those brands, and tastes noting like drinking it fresh from a coconut. There is something about the way they process it that makes it taste terrible. Thats why Amazon keeps putting it on sale... it doesn't taste good. Some things are too good to be true and this is one of them. Steer clear."
1,"If you like it buy it, but dont waste your money to try it","This stuff im sure is fine for people who are used to the taste of coconut water. Otherwise if your not used to it and just want to try something new, stay away. Its very bland and tastes like water with a few drops of coconut milk in it. To be frank im not sure why someone would even buy this. There may be other uses for it. I have found the only use is having a few sips and throwing it right in the garbage can. Ick."
2,Maybe the flavored ones are better?,"I purchased a case of Vita Coco at my local Costco thinking it would be a nice way to rehydrate after working out. The flavored ones might be better, but to me the plain tastes like vomit. This is not an example of hyperbole. It literally tastes like vomit. Unlike a previous reviewer I think it's better room temperature than it is chilled, but I will not be purchasing this variety again. I'd be willing to try one of the flavored varieties, because maybe that masks the nasty."
3,Okay but a little bland,"This was the 2nd brand of RTD coconut water that I tried from Amazon.com. I was disappointed with the first brand I tried (Zico) and tried this next. While I found this brand to taste a bit better, it still was not as sweet and aromatic as the fresh coconuts that I usually get from the Asian supermarkets here. While it is not as sour as Zico, the flavor is still too bland for me.Fortunately, Amazon.com has added a few more brands and after trying a couple more, I found something more to my taste."
2,Lacking,"I was excited at the thought of a coconut flavored healthy drink. All I can say is, this stuff is nasty. I was disappointed. You can't drink it if you have any taste buds at all."
2,Sugar water,"To me Vita Coco tastes like sugar water. I tried cold, I tried warm. Same taste. It does not taste like coconut water. I prefer O.N.E to this and Zico. Zico is also better than Vita, imo."
3,Not from Brazil,"I ordered two packs and they both were made in Philippine. Comparing to Zico, Vita is a bit sweeter and supposedly all natural, not from concentrated like Zico."
5,One vs Vita coconut water,I found both good. VITA a little more sweet than ONE. Not sure why. Maybe its where the coconut water is comming fromBut ONE does taste very much like the water from a green coconut. While VITA tasts like the water from a little ripened coconut.Fyi ripened coconut is one which has a little pulp in it compared to a green coconut which has yet to start forming th epulp insideThe pulp makes the water a little sweet.If you are drinking for health reasons then ONE is the preferred one. Also if you care about the amount of sweetness in a drinkMy preference is ONE
2,I dont like it but,"I grew up with a coconut tree in our yard.It bears fruit all year round.We harvest it, we cut it open with a machete that was as old as I am.But I left that house long time ago and I do miss the taste of the young coconut. The only time I get to taste one is when I go Hawaii and I could even tell when the coconut was harvested.I dont even buy the one at the Asian market because its a gamble when you buy one.I tried coconut water or juice in a can and it made me threw up.So I avoided it.Last 2 weeks ago I saw this new product in the grocery store. Its the Naked coconut water,It actually tasted not bad but expensive.I tried another brand,O.N.E. this one even tastes better.And now I tried this VitaCoCo.This one has the same aftertaste as the canned ones but a bit milder and so i am able to drink itbutI dont like it.So I wont be buying this one,.I cancelled the future order."
5,Tastes Great,If you love coconut you will love this water. It truly does taste like drinking it right from the source.
2,Tomato Juice Flavor,"Vita Coco tastes like tomato juice. The tomato juice flavor wears off quickly and the coconut water can be tasted. Some say it is related to the ""Vitamin C"" added to Vita Coco. I won't be buying the Vita Coco again, but of the coconut water I have tried.. I like:#1 O.N.E. - slightly sweet. My favorite so far.#2 Naked - neutral tasting.#3 Roland - this has sugar added but has the flavor of mature coconut as we all know and love.Did Not Qualify -Vita Coco - tomato juice flavor.Zico - has an intense bready flavor. Passion fruit version tastes too intense and phony."
2,Coconut water,"The taste is, well, hard to get used to. It does taste like a coconut as described so the product is not to blame. It's just my taste buds that don't like it."
5,Hydration During and After Workouts,"I use Vita Coco during and after workouts for the hydration and the potassium. I really like the 11.1 size package, which is smaller than the bottles available in stores for up to $3.00. I have read that some reviewers don't like that it has added vitamin C - they complained it altered the taste. Although this product for me was an acquired taste, I like it and I appreciate the extra vitamin c in my diet. Honestly, I don't know what it tastes like to drink straight from a coconut, but that doesn't matter to me. I need the benefits from this product. I also appreciate the magnesium from this product for my ailing gall bladder."
5,Yum,"This coconut water is super good and refreshing. Would buy again, over and over again, it tastes so darn good."
4,Good Taste,"My family really likes this coconut water. It has a clean, fresh taste. It's a good choice for coconut water lovers."
3,Tastes OK.,"Best tasting of the coconut waters I have tried. Most of them are really bad, but this one is OK."
1,BAD TASTING PRODUCT,"I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS PRODUCT SELLS. THE TASTE IS REAL BAD. EVERYONE, OVER 2 DOZEN PEOPLE HAVE TRIED WHAT I RECEIVED, YUCK! IS MY PRODUCT BAD, OR IS THE PRODUCT ITSELF BAD TASTING?"
1,New Ingredients: Sugar and Vitamin C now added,"Our family has been drinking vita coco for years. We loved the fact that is was 100% natural coconut water with no added ingredients. Unfortunately, Vita coco has changed their formula and they are now adding sugar and vitamins to the coconut water. If I wanted sugar drinks I'd drink gatorade or vitamin water. Vita Coco is no longer 100% pure cocoonut water. It tastes noticeably worse and artificial. What a letdown. We won't be drinking Vita anymore."
1,"Yuck, yuck, yucky!","I have had some great coconut water. I have had it straight from the source and packaged. It is usually sweet and wonderful. This is *NOT*! This tastes like fermented juice of some sort that doesn't even resemble coconut. It's sour and bitter. I drank a couple of these hoping to get used to the taste but couldn't. I don't have anything positive to say about this drink, so 1 star it is. I am very disappointed."
1,"Has an odd, artifical taste","As far as coconut waters go, this is poor. I could hardly even stomach it. I imagine that if you don't have a lot of experience with coconut water, you may think this is pretty good. But this isn't how they're supposed to taste. Go try Taste Nirvana's real coconut water made from Thai coconuts, and you'll understand what I'm talking about. I am really worried about what is in Vita Coco's water that makes it taste so off compared to natural waters."
3,i prefer ZICO,"not bad, but i prefer ZICO coconut water. vitacoco seems to have a bit of an odd after taste, IMO."
2,Has added sugar now. :(,"Well, when I first started buying this, it just said ""100% coconut water"" on the package. Now it says ""Coconut water, Less than 1% natural fruit sugar, vitamin C.""Coconut water already has plenty of sugar in it. WHY would they add sugar to it? I'm buying this for health reasons - I am always crazy thirsty no matter how much water I drink, and coconut water helps alleviate that thirst better than anything else. I'm trying to find something natural and healthy, so adding sugar to it makes absolutely no sense to me. I'm certainly not drinking it for the taste.At any rate, buyer beware. It's not actually 100% coconut water anymore. It's 99% coconut water and 1% added fruit sugar. Maybe it always had been and they were forced to change the label, but there's plenty out there that don't have added sugar. 1% may not matter to some, but to others looking for something natural or trying to avoid unnecessary sugars, it might."
1,Tastes like VitaCACA!,"We first thought this was the bee's knees when we first found it at Costco. Since then, we bought and compared about 10 different brands and now this one tastes HORRIBLE! The brand that comes THE CLOSEST to tasting like naturally picked coconut water is this one:Taste Nirvana Real Coconut Water, 16.2-Ounce (Pack of 12)"
2,Do yourself a favor and skip this one,"If you're looking for a product that actually tastes like coconut water, you'd better skip this one. I'm not sure whether I should blame all that extra potassium they added, but it tastes like something made in a factory. Very disappointed. Skip it. Get Nirvana."
5,Yummy,I love this coconut water. It tastes fresh and refreshing. Never buying Gatorade or any of the sports drink again!
4,vita coconut wata mon,"I've had the real thing several times, but this Vita stuff is good too. Vita is the only brand that I have tried so far. Of the single ones that I drank from two cases (gave some away), they all were good and they all tasted the same - no yucky ones in my batch. I will be trying the other brands also. I kind of crave this stuff. Maybe I got a potassium deficiency. Happy chugging."
3,Vita Coco Water,This is okay. Not the best but by no means the worst I have ever tasted. Made a descent mixer for rum with the adding of pineapple juice.
2,Gave me an upset stomach.,"I have no doubt that this is a healthy beverage option for many individuals, but it gave me an awful upset stomach. I had wanted this to be an additional nutritional item to my juicing but it simply does not work for me."
4,"Not the best, but still fantastic.","I'm subscribed to this on a monthly basis from Amazon Prime (free shipping!). Discounts FTW. It's tasty, decently priced... and the little boxes are simple and convenient.Also, no pulp in my coconut water is a plus for me, and that's how Vita rolls."
2,dont like the flavor,"It is my first to try this. I need some beverage to hydrate myself when the heater is on. I try this one because it is natural.However,I do not like the flavor at all...so bad"
5,Great for Hangovers,"Have purchased many times in stores on a whim but, ordered the 12 pack to always have some on hand. Anyway super refreshing and way better then gatorade for those rough mornings."
3,Not the best tasting,"I never write reviews but I was highly disappointed in the flavor of this coconut water. I grew up drinking fresh andcanned coconut water. I thought for sure with all the high reviews, my family and I would love this product. Thiswas a bit bitter and was hard for me to put down. If you've never had this brand, I suggest buying 1 from the marketbefore committing to a case."
3,Not the greatest coconut water I've tasted,"It has a bit of an aftertaste like artificial grape drink, the tang I suspect comes from storage in improper temps. I would have to try a fresh pack to make a full assessment."
2,Does not taste like coconut water these days,These days it tastes different. Does not taste like coconut water.It was my favorite drink few months back. Looking for other products in market.
1,No good coconut water,Absolutely horrible taste. It made me sick! I would not even give it one star! I really want my money back! It was a disapointment. I would have been a regular customer.
4,Real close to the original,"I haven't tasted other brands, so don't know how this compares with others. But this one tasted real close to the original. Its not as sweet as home grown tender coconuts are, but not bland either. I am not an expert with nutrition, but i have heard that its good for health to have it before breakfast."
3,"it was good, but something was off","I grew up drinking the real deal - coconut water from young [green] coconuts. I thought I'd give Vita Coco a try and it was okay. It tasted like real coconut water, not the marketed ones with added sugar, but I had one problem with it. There was a weird aftertaste following the drink. Maybe the drink took on the taste of the container? That's the only problem I had with it, other than that, it tasted as close as it could get to coconut water from a fresh green coconut."
4,"good coconut water, but i would stick with water to hydrate... NOT GOOD FOR WEIGHT LOSS","it is coconut water, pretty much what you would expect. barely sweet... which is understandable as its pure. anyway, someone mentioned something about good for weightloss i believe... not true. this thing, although better in that respect than say... soda, is still loaded with carbs. 15g of carbs per serving. this drink isnt sweet enough to justify that many carbs (carbs drive insulin secretion and thus fat storage in our bodies). not to knock the drink so much, but not a good alternative to water, and not good for dieters, if this is your focus."
4,Taste good,I was hesitate to order this based on some reviews about how it taste.I decided to give it a try and I like it. I usually get fresh young coconut from Asian market but hate the inconvenient of having to chop it open. This product taste as good as fresh coconut in my opinion. Very convenient and not sweet for me.
5,Great product- good price,"I love Amazon for making it possible to buy hard to find food and this is one of them. The coconut water is great!!!! and the price is the same as in the store, but hard to find."
1,Inconsistent quality,"Vita coco is not a good product. I ordered this three times because I had surgery and needed something that did not contain preservatives and sugar or artificial sweeteners.The water is not supposed to be BROWN! It should not taste of the box!This is disgusting and I dread drinking it. Some of the boxes were quite good, but some ranged from dark brown to muddy water looking.This company has no idea of quality control.I will never purchase vita coco again! I know about coconut water having had the real thing in Mexico, Caribbean and South America!Forget this product. I think that three shipments make me an expert on the garbage they are passing off as coconut water."
2,Poor quality control,"I first ordered this in June and was very pleased with the product. Nothing beats fresh coconut juice but this was a good substitute. It tasted good and it did a good job of quenching thirst. I ordered it again and the second time was bad. Liquid was a bit yellowish in color and it tasted a bit rancid. Amazon was nice enough to replace it. BUT ... the 3rd batch was worse. It wasn't yellowish, but it was a bit darker in color. And it did not taste like coconut water at all. I was hoping the 3rd batch would be better - as it had a best before date of April 2010. The second batch was January 2010. But I guess that doesn't really make a difference, as you may get unlucky (twice?!) and get a bad batch. I am not contacting Amazon for another replacement. Dissapointing. No more buying coconut water online for me."
1,More like Apple Juice,"Though I normally love coconut water, I was very disappointed with this product. Though you can taste some coconut, it tastes as though it has been thinned with apple juice. I checked the ingredient list and apple juice does not appear (as is so common with many juices), but the flavor is undeniably present."
1,Very disappointing,"I completely agree with the reviewers that feel this stuff tastes artificial, almost chemical-like. Also agree with those who say it tastes nothing like coconut. I expected something richer with a strong coconut flavor. Instead it's an unidentifiable sweet unpleasant taste with an equally unpleasant after-taste. I have no fresh coconut water to compare this to, so it may or may not taste like fresh coconut water, but whatever the taste, it's completely unappealing. On top of this, the product is not cheap.Edit: When this stuff is ice cold it is much better tasting than it is at room temperature. I would upgrade my rating to two stars but Amazon will not allow that."
1,terrible,"This was terrible, ended up trying product and throwing rest of the box away. It actually made me sick. Does not taste like what comes out of a cracked coconut at all. Yuk"
1,Tasted rancid and the color is yellowish not clear,"I would have given 5 stars if it tasted as before because I actually love this brand of coconut water. However, I hated the new taste of it, it tasted rancid and almost undrinkable. I am so disappointed because I bought 3 boxes of them, they are not expired, but I can't drink them. I'll see if I return them. For some reason the 11 ounce bottles are not good. I also bought the 33 ounce package and they continue to taste great. BUT DO NOT BUY THIS 11 OUNCE CONTAINERS THEY ARE HORRIBLE. IT HAS TO CHANGE IN ORDER FOR ME TO BUY MORE."
1,Poor,"The product arrived on time, but all the coconut water was spoilt, had changed color and was tasting bad. I would not recommend the product or ateast ordering it online."
1,Not good,"Been from Brazil, i know what a coconut water taste,and this brand does not meet that taste. I am just been honest. It does not taste good at all!"
1,These used to be great... Go with a diffetent brand.,"These used to be great but the inconsistent taste and a few rotten ones make this a TERRIBLE buy / risk. Look for coco water that's not heat treated as well, for a much healthier and natural organic product. TERRIBLE customer service from vita water as well, IGNORANT company.For an unbeatable taste in coconut water, but the pre cut baby coconuts in your local market. I understand most people don't want to crack into a coconut all the time, but if you're at home and want to enjoy the best possible tasting coconut water, give this a try. The taste is night and day. :)*Amazon is amazing as always"
3,Definitely not the best,"When I drink VitaCoco, it's almost always flavored (pineapple or mango). I used to think I just couldn't stand the taste of coconut water without another fruity infused in it, but after trying other plain coconut waters such as[[ASIN:B002Z04ZNQ Amy & Brian Natural Coconut Juice Pulp Free, 17.5- Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)], I realized that there is nothing wrong with plain coconut water, just mainstream coconut waters such as this one. Not to mention, I think the fruit flavors of VitaCoco just help cover the bad taste.This actually wasn't so bad before I started trying the better coconut waters, so if you're happy with this - stay away from the better ones. You won't want to come back to this! This isn't god-awful, but it's definitely nowhere close to being the best coconut water on the market. Try Amy & Brian's or Taste Nirvana if you want the best, and trust me - REAL coconut waters don't need added fruit flavors; they are simply delicious on their own."
2,Disappointed - ingredients have changed!,"I buy this product from Costco. I bought some yesterday and noticed a packaging change. When I got it home and was putting it in the cabinet, I noticed the containers from my previous purchase said ""100% pure coconut water"" and the new containers said only ""pure coconut water"". I turned the products over to compare ingredients. Sure enough, the ""100% pure"" shows the only ingredient being Natural Coconut Water while the other has the ingredients of coconut water, less the 1% natural fruit sugar, vitamin C. This was very disappointing to me. Why mess with a good thing?Before posting this review I decided to taste test the two. The new container tasted slightly watered down and left an almost bitter aftertaste.This used to be a good product but I won't be purchasing anymore."
1,Tastes bad..,"I have been buying vita coco since few months form walmart and other stores. It tasted really good and those were packed in brazil. Last week i bought from amazon, as it is way cheaper than the stores. But it tasted really different and weird. Not even near the one i used to buy. So i checked and it is packed in srilanka.I am not buying from here anymore."
1,Vita Coco has changed for the worse,"This stuff used to be sourced in Brazil and it was delicious. Now the juice comes from Asia and is sugary, sweeter, thicker, and unpleasant. Economics-driven outsourcing I guess. Avoid it!"
4,Good Product,"I use this product for maintaining electrolytes during hours of strenuous exercise (hiking, running, and cycling). The taste is acceptable and it does the job, helping to reduce muscle cramps."
4,"Cleanses the palate, large size. No straws!","I love having this drink after a heavier meal because it's so light and refreshing, it makes you feel clean and renewed. It's also a decent size for the price; it's not a cheap drink but you get a lot. It's light but it's not water, so you can only drink so much in one sitting. I usually split one container into two portions.Highly potable...but my pack did not come with drinking straws! I'm not sure if the rest of the world happens to have straws at home, but I certainly don't. It was obnoxious that there was a place to punch a straw through, but no straw to do it with. I ended up just opening them from the side (like a milk container) and pouring it out into a cup."
4,Healthy and tasty coconut water! Good alternative for soft drinks and other sugary juice!,Most of the boxes have fresh tasting cocOnut water! I ran into some bad juice boxes in the 12 pack but still happy with it!
4,Really good coconut Water !!,"So, i have been reviewing a lot of coconut water off late. Finally decided to buy this one.I am glad that i did. the taste of the coconut water is really good.probably the closest to the real coconut water.will surely recommend this. this particular product that i ordered has 200% vitamin C.if you choose to order regular, please pay attention to the product details."
1,If you expect coconut flavor keep looking,We ordered these for our kids but we are pretty disappointed...We have purchased the actual coconuts in the past but they are not easy to come by... So we thought that these might be convenient to keep in the fridge... However... What's in these boxes DOES NOT TASTE LIKE COCONUT AT ALL!!Pricey and not tasty... Definitely Not worth the $ we spent :0(
3,Taste weird comparing to other brand,It doesn't taste as good as some other brand in the market. The packaging affects the taste.Didn't meet expectation.
3,Good deal,"With all the different coconut waters in the market, this brand was on sale and I decided to try it. I normally drink Zico, but Vita was sweeter and almost resembled a juice. I personally would stick to Zico."
3,NOT 100% pure coconut water,"When I received my order of Vita Coco ""100% pure coconut water"", I opened one, took a big swig and immediately noticed an odd, slightly sour or tart taste I've never tasted in coconut water before. It was subtle, but noticeable. I looked at the ingredients and saw that the package contains coconut water and vitamin C. I'm not sure how you can claim a product is 100% pure coconut water when you have added something to it. Now, vitamin C isn't harmful of course, but why would they add anything to it in the first place?Other than that, the taste is acceptable. It's not as fresh-tasting as water straight from the coconut, but I suppose it would be unrealistic to expect packaged juice to taste exactly like fresh. I am going to try a different brand and make a comparison."
2,17 Ounce Taste Better,"This may sound weird. Same company, same Coconut Water right?Wrong!! I first purchased the 11 ounce in store, and it was beyond yucky.Growing up on an Island,you'd be able to tell the difference Pronto.However, after giving VitaCoCo another chance with the 17 ounce. I struck gold. So tastyI think it's the box they use for the 11 ounce, that makes the water taste rotten.I'll never buying the 11 ounce again."
3,"More refreshing than water, but rather bland for my taste","Truth in advertising, I had fresh coconut water a couple of times in Hawaii, but am not a regular consumer. I bought some of this based on an Amazon promotion during August. I find the product a bit more refreshing than water when I'm dehydrated, but not something that is terribly appealing. I'll finish off my two cases by drinking it after heavy exercise sessions, and won't re-order. The type with pineapple added is a bit more enjoyable than the ""straight"" product, but not enough so that I'll order more at the price. If you have experience with coconut water and like it, you may like this very well, but I predict most will think it is ""okay"" and nothing more."
2,Not for me,I like coconuts but this didn't taste anything like one to me.I won't be ordering anymore of this stuff.
2,Price to high,I have found other 100% Coconut water at our local grocery at three cans for $1.00. The taste was as good and the ingredients were 100% coconut water. This product is way over priced at Amazon.
5,Love this stuff!,Coconut water is soooo delicious and refreshing. This is my favorite brand. It's great to drink after a workout instead of sports drinks.
3,I wish it tasted better,"It's pretty amazing they can pack so many nutrients and electrolytes into a little package, but the taste just left me unsatisfied. You want it to taste like water, or like milk, but instead it ends up being something in between that is impossible to describe. It's not sweet enough to really be thirst quenching and it has just enough of an after taste to really leave you not wanting more. Unless I'm pounding one after a long workout or run I really can't see myself drinking these for any reason."
2,Taste like a plain/unsweet coconut juice,"It tastes like coming from an unsweet coconut, which I don't like. And, my husband doesn't like this taste either. So, we don't plan to buy more."
2,The product is not consistent,"I have purchased several different bottles of vita coco in different states and different sizes. They are ver inconsistent, ranging from very good to very bad. I have found that the smaller bottles tend to be better. I was so happy to have found the same taste as a fresh green coconut, then purchased a larger qty and bottles to be very disappointed :( and wasted money on an undrinkable item. Don't buy in bulk."
2,I like coconut water -- but not this.,"For the past few months, I have been drinking O.N.E. Coconut Water, which I love. Vita Coco was on sale at the grocery store, so I picked up a few to try. While I have never had coconut water straight from the coconut, I would be surprised if it tasted like this. This has a rather strong sourish taste and aftertaste. O.N.E. is just refreshing and good, and has a much more natural taste, in my opinion. I doubt I ever would have developed my coconut water habit had Vita Coco been my first experience."
2,Not the Best Flavor,"If you are looking for the best smooth tasting coconut water, this is not the brand for you. I have been drinking ZICO coconut water and decided to try this brand. It was a mistake. This VITA COCO brand has an off taste, like you can taste the container (cardboard) flavor in it. I did not like this at all. I will switch back to the ZICO brand; I truly feel it has the best flavor of any I have tried so far. Hope this helps you."
1,This is JUNK FOOD,"Coconut water comes from young, fresh coconuts - it is ALIVE!!!!!!!!!!This is highly processed, old, rancid, BOILED UNTIL DEAD coconut water with chemicals added to it.Anything good you thought you were getting... has been processed out!"
1,fake coconut,It is fake coconut because if it a real coconut water when you spelt it in you white shirt the spot will go black. When I spelt this one my shirt not turn black it fake and taste so bad
1,AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE,"I love coconut water/juice. Every time I go to any market I look for it and buy it and have a good idea of what's out there. Occasionally I even buy real coconuts. But on to the review. I bought this pack of 12 for a little less than $1.00 a unit. I've tasted it room temperature, chilled, with ice, and even frozen. It's barely sweet, in fact a sour taste stands out more than anything. If one knows what coconut taste like then one can find the coconut flavor some where in this juice, but it doesn't stand out. The juice is pretty clear with a SLIIIIIIGHT yellow color tint so there was no oddities with the coloration. I really did try to like this product, I've only 3 units left and still I'm just not seeing it. Perhaps a bad batch???... a really bad batch??? If this was someone's first experience with coconut juice, they would probably not be a big fan of it. I will refrain from buying this product, and I advise the same to others."
3,A Bit Dissapointed,"I have been ordering Brian and Amy Coconut Water and opted to change as the cans that I have been receiving were damaged and this brand was cheaper. I was really dissapointed in the taste. it was really bland compared to the other. Guess I will be switching back, dented cans and all."
1,Awful Tasting!,"I kept hearing how great CoConut Water is on the Joe Rogan podcast. So I thought I'd give it a try. I ordered this. I think it tastes awful. I'm not really sure what people enjoy about this stuff, but it's outright nasty. I won't be ordering more."
2,Live and Learn,"O.K. I am a little eccentric and bought six cases on this stuff because it was on sale. I like One coconut water so I thought I would like this. No way. It is not delicious like One. So well, I will drink it but I am a disappointed as it was such a treat to cool off in the evening with a cold one. :) Maybe you will like the taste."
5,love this stuff!!,reminds me of drinking straight from a coconut in mexico! delicious and great for you!! highly recommend it!!
2,Just OK,"It's just not a coconut, and it's got a slightly strange taste. It's ok, but I probably wouldn't get a second time."
4,Great product!,"I use the coconut water with a few strawberries and my Protein powder every morning....Tastes better than using skim milk and the VitaCoco doesn't upset my stomach the way the milk sometimes does. Even alone, it has a light refreshing taste. Just wish it was available online in the 17 oz. size...."
2,Not Great,"Maybe my expectations are too high but this product taste nothing like REAL fresh coconut water. Since fresh young coconuts are out of season, I tried this product. There's an odd tangy taste...maybe from whatever they put in it to fortify the water with vitamin C."
3,"Great prodcut, not such a great price","Just a quick note - we are big coconut water people. This is a great product. Only rated it low due to price. They have this same package at Costco for 17 bucks. That's a pretty significant difference. I'm also a HUGE Amazon person, so I rarely shop around, but I just happened to grab some more at Costco yesterday and saw this today... Even with subscribe and save it's 19 - which isn't so bad for the convenience. Go subscribe and save if you have Amazon Prime."
2,Not good as first batch,"Ordered 4 of them after we liked the taste with a test order, but these were not good at all, but thanks to Amazon since I got another 4 for free of cost and yet to try them. Looks like they are hit and miss with the quality."
5,love this stuff,"I think that coconut water is the best, all natural way to replace electrolytes lost during exercise. Vita coconut water is the best tasting brand I've tried."
4,taste great,Ordered and arrived fast from amazon. I like the taste just fine. Use it sometimes after workouts and it quenches my thirst. Good product and will buy again.
2,not much taste,"I was disappointed with this product. It was very bland tasting. Also, straws were not included which makes it very hard to use in lunches and on the go."
4,Very close to fresh coconut water,"I am not from Brazil, but a place called Kerala, India (the very name of the place comes from coconut tree because we have coconut trees all over the place: […] Coconut is an ingredient in everything we cook (from breakfast to lunch to dinner).Vita Coco is by far the closest to fresh tender coconut juice I have tasted. Not 5 stars because still not close to the fresh taste. When you drink fresh coconut water, it has a carbonated feeling (like soda) that it gets naturally which adds to the taste."
3,To everyone who thinks the taste is off...,"It just dawned on me what Vitacoco tastes like...coco water + ALOE JUICE! It's good, but definitely tastes like it was diluted with aloe...alot of aloe."
4,"Luxury in US, cheap in South America","Coconut water is IMO much better than sports drinks and as equally refreshing. It can be consumed any time without feeling guilty. Vita Coco is good, I just don't understand why it comes from the Phillipines but Born in Brazil?I know when I was in Brazil you could get cocunut water dirt cheap right out of the nut. The fruit grows everywhere, but it's not cheap like a banana. My recommendation would be to sell this by the gallon instead of small containers. I would be more inclined to purchase if the price was better. The quality still seems good, though. After all, it's all natural?"
2,Order two times they tasted bad.....,I had bought some vito coco from Gnc they tasted great... When i order two boxes from amazon i tasted something was wrong so i compared them Gnc tasted good... So i called amazon they sent me two more box they where still were bad.. So i called again and got a refund on them.. Ill never buy they from amazon again.... On the boxes they expire JUL 15 2011 and Sep 3 2011.
5,Great Stuff,"Have tried other brands but this one is smooth, has slight coconut flavor but not overwhelming, great hydration product, have used for years"
5,Love itadd,"Well Vita Coco gives you just what they say, pure coconut water. The taste is fresh and light no preservatives added, this is where I get my supply. Price is great"
1,Rancid,"I order these all the time but the this batch was absolutely aweful, I opened it and the smell was horendous when I poured it out it was yellow. I really love coconut water and was so disappointed to have waste my money."
1,Bad batch! Do not purchase until resolved!,"Whatever they shipped for their deal of the day last week is a very bad batch, sour and metallic tasting - and it's cloudy and slightly yellow!Something is wrong. Please don't ship more from this batch, Amazon!Vita Coco isn't the best coconut water, but it's been good bang for the buck - I have previously purchased it at both Amazon and retail stores. It didn't taste anything like this! I would give a good batch 3.5 stars (the extra .5 for value)"
2,Change in taste to vitacoco,I have been drinking vitacoco pure coconut water for the past two years and I find there is a change in the taste. I am from the caribbean and I grew up drinking pure coconut water. It is clear or cloudy in color and I just pour some into a cup from my online order and it is peachy in color with no taste. I am truly disappointed. Mass production is not the way to go.
2,Not as expected,"I tried this product in costco and it was the best coconut water I ever tasted here in US. I had purchased several cases of this from costco earlier. Costco is not carrying it anymore...so I ordered from amazon and subscribed to deliver ( you get additional discount)when the product arrived it was as bad as canned coconut water you get in chinese stores. I had my old batch from costco, I was able to taste them side by side. What amazon delivered was very bad, I am tasting some kind of chemical trace, not acceptable at all. looking for alternative. I love coconut water :)"
1,Isn't what it used to be | Flavor has changed for the worse,"I have been buying Vita Coco for YEARS now, and have always been pleased with their product. Until recently. Something has changed, which started around the time they began using their new blue-packaging. The coconut water just tastes off. Like sweet soap was added. It's pretty disappointing, as I've contacted Vita Coco multiple times about this issue and have not received any notable follow-up since my initial call."
1,VitaCoco spoiled and the coconut water was brown,"I subscripted to this order. The date for a 12-pack expiring in 2/2010.I opened up first packet and it tasted sour, I poured it out and the coconut water was brown.I tried a second packet and it tasted bad, sour and it was also brown. The coconut water I believe it was left too long in the heat. I tried to return the product but Amazon says the ""grocery"" item is not returnable.Please beaware to receving a bad batch. In this case, I lost money and isn't any help from Amazon.comI gave Amazon.com is 0........ zero star."
1,Tastes ruined!,"Possibly it's because we've been having record heat here this summer when this was enroute, but I've opened one container, and it tasted sour and rotten. I immediately looked at the returns policy, too late. It cannot be returned. I'll try another one, but chances aren't good that it will taste any differently."
3,tasty but has consistency issues,"I have enjoyed this product and have bought 4 cases in total, BUT the product's flavor is not consistent, AND I've had three containers go bad and ferment... two of which exploded and made a big mess. This problem make me wonder about how well pasteurized it is. I don't intend to purchase again."
5,Closest so far to the real deal!,I have ordered this multiple times from Amazon and have also setup a subscription for automatic delivery every month.The drink is absolutely refreshing (when chilled) and tastes similar to the real deal! Tasty and full of nutrients.Go buy some and taste it to know what I mean!
1,Horrible flavor,"After recently trying a different company's ""Mango Coconut Splash"" (coconut water + juice), I wanted to try more coconut products, so I ordered this. I can't even attempt to describe the actual flavor of what we received, so I'll just say that it was one of the most unpleasant things I've ever experienced. I'll stick to the Mango Coconut."
1,VITA COCO NO NO NO!,"I've always liked coconut water but I'm sorry to say, this stuff is awful! Maybe I got a bad batch. I've read some other reviews about people getting a bad batch. I've never had that happen with coconut water before but I guess it must. I will never buy this brand again."
5,Like the taste.,I loved the taste of this coconut water. This is by far the best packaged coconut water I had. Far better than Goya and Zico.
2,Not what I thought.,"I have this on auto delivery, but I am going to cancel it today. I am sure there are some health benefits to drinking this stuff, but here are my qualms:Taste is not like it came right out of the shell. It has a boxed like taste.Sugar is too high. I can't have that amount of sugar on a regular basis. For hydrating nothing beats water. I workout every day and run as well as chop wood. My diet is varied and provides more than enough of these nutrients. Blood test was excellent. Nutritional content; I am sure it has some of the qualities that it boasts, but I am not willing to make the sugar compromise for the magnesium/potassium benefit. I will just take a supplement. It is cheaper. Plus I eat way to much cocoa and that has the highest amount of magnesium from a natural product. For potassium; plantains are good. They are just like bananas. A diverse diet is best."
2,Meh,"I found this to be the most bitter/least naturally sweet coconut water that I've had. I'm kind of disappointed that I have to plow through the remaining package before treating myself to a different brand.Amy & Brians (expensive, but amazing) > Zico > VitaCoco"
2,some batches are better than others. Not consistent. Thailand coconut water is the best....not Brazilian,I have been drinking Vita coco for a while now.....buying from different stores and once here from Amazon. The consistency is all over the place is what I have found. I much rather prefer the Thailand based coconut water products out there...much better tasting than Brazilian
1,Terrible,"About one month after receipt, I brought whole box to a park sharing with friends, all of them tuns light yellow color and taste sour...threw to the trash can..."
1,Sour Products received,"This product was sour when I received it. I tried every box only to find that they were all sour!I contacted the manufacturer who advised me to contact Amazon.com who has a no return policy on this item. I want a refund of my money! I will not recommend this to anyone else.I only gave this one star so that my review can post, otherwise it'd be a zero."
1,"Very nutritious, but extremely sweet","I wanted to love this; the nutritional benefits of coconut water are outstanding. Unfortunately, for me, the taste wasn't. I have only had the pure coconut water version of this product; it was sweet to an extreme. I'm not a lover of sweet tasting things, so I had to practically gag this down. Not sure I want to try the other flavors; I fear they would be just as sweet.Too bad; if I could drink this without despising the taste I'd love it for the health benefits."
1,YUCK!,"In general, I like coconut. This was awful. At first it was really watery and progressively became more concentrated even though I shook it several times. The packaging was pretty neat, but that is the only positive thing I have to say which is rather sad."
1,Does not taste like Coconut Water,"I am very disappointed with this purchase. It was on Amazon's Friday sale and the price was very attractive (compared to normal price) so I went for it. I normally purchase Young Thai Coconuts, but breaking them open can be a hassle sometimes, so I bought a case just for the convenience of it. I've tried Zico (back when it was still in Tetra Pak)before and was a fan so I assumed Vitacoco was similar. Boy was I wrong. Vitacoco taste nothing like fresh coconut water. To me, it just taste like sugar water, or non-fresh coconut water that has been left out too long and thus fermented. It was this tart aftertaste with a faint hint of coconut flavor. Does not warrant the price it cost.Lesson Learned: DO not buy in bulk if you have never tried it before."
3,Very yummy and refreshing. No straw (unlike O.N.E.). 1/24 had weird taste,"I like this coconut water. The taste is just a bit stronger than the other brands while still being 100% coconut water. However, I hate how it doesn't come with a straw unlike the other tetra-pack drinks. And on the picture they show a straw in a coconut.I bought 2 packs of 12, one of them (out of 24) tasted weird. It had a petroleum smell/taste to it. I drank a few sips and a few more since it was so expensive, but ended up throwing it out. Anyone else with this issue? I kinda don't want to reorder it if it gets contaminated with that kind of stuff."
5,Good tasting coco water,"The water tastes good, very natural. Like the fact that it is not sweet. Quite addictive. A little on a pricey side for what it is. Packets are small and go fast."
2,"First Time Coconut Water purchaser, did NOT LIKE IT","I don't know if it is this brand or all coconut water, but I wanted to try it to see what all the hoopla is about and I do not like the flavor at all. It really almost made me gag, and I am really not that particular of a person. I do drink Vitamin water, Propel and other water type drinks, but this is just really gross for all of you that are thinking about trying it, I would go to the grocery store and get one container to try before buying a big ol' case like I did."
1,Not what i expected,I don't know what i expected but this wasn't it. The taste is disgusting and i do not see what the hype is all about. Im stuck with a case of coconut water that taste disgusting. Im adding it to my smoothies to get rid of it and the fruit in my smoothies covers the taste. One benefit is the potassium that it adds to my smoothies other than that...Will Not Purchase Ever Again!
1,Subscribe and Save,"I cancelled this item. I orginally order this as a subscribe and save item for 13.00. then this month amazon had the audicity to charge me 26.00 and not even inform me. The whole purpose of subscribe and save is to have the value, peace of mind and honesty of receiving the product for the best price. Subscribe and save should be just that."
1,Not good,"Well, I guess I have been spoilt for all others. I bought this at Costco. I have tried coconut milk from a coconut and loved it. This didn't come close. I won't buy it again."
2,Not what I expected,"I ordered this product because of it's advertised health benefits, but I found that it is not something I like! I suppose it is of good quality for what it is. Maybe it is an acquired taste."
3,too much vitamin C?,"I bought two 12 packs of this brand. It tastes ok to me, but I haven't compaired it to the other brands yet. The high amount of vitamin C contained in one serving has me concerned. I found I got a canker sore the next day after drinking my first box. I also wonder how they can call it 100% pure if it has added Vitamin C - which they would have to do in order to get a 230% daily value - that's about 138mg of vita c, and the normal amount (I found while net surfing) is about 5 mg per 8oz serving, which should make this no more than 10 mg of vita c for 11.2 oz. I will use this up(hopefully) with food prep and meals, but it's too much vita c for me to drink a box every day."
1,yellow coconut water,"Quality varies! bought two 1L package today and when I poured out the juice, it is a darkish yellow and tastes sour :( I gave the other bottle a try and opened it ---- same yellow water!"
3,I WILL TELL YOU WHAT BRAND IS THE BEST,"THE ONLY BRAND THAT TASTE LIKE REAL COCONUT JUICE IS ""BRIAN AND AMY NATURAL COCONUT JUICE""AND ""TASTE OF NIRVANA COCONUT JUICE"" PERIOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Tastes like flavorless grape juice, NOT coconut water","I've always just bought coconut water in the grocery store, never on amazon.com. I tried vitacoco in the store. I don't know if they've changed their formula, but what I had in the store tasted pretty good, so I ordered a case from amazon. Maybe amazon is carrying a different version, but what I got doesn't taste the same as what I had in the store. There is a weird grape-like taste, like canned grape juice. I'm pretty sure the version I had from the grocery had Vitamin C listed as an ingredient (which I didn't mind). This package lists no ingredients besides coconut water, which I don't think is true advertising. It's not listed as an ingredient, but the package says it contains 230% of the Daily Value of Vitamin C. Coconuts are not a natural source of vitamin C, so I find it suspicious that it has that much and Vitamin C/Ascorbic Acid is not listed as an ingredient. I would not order this again."
5,Very Much Like the Fresh Juice.,"I frequently visit Yucatan, Mexico and one of the activities I really enjoy is to visit the coconut vendor and drink fresh coconut water from the fruit in his cooler. Vita Coco is the closest thing I've found to the fresh product, has a refreshing flavor, and I'm sure is quite healthy for the body."
5,agua de coco!,"First of all, coconut water does not taste like coconut. It has its own clear flavor. My favorite Vita Coco flavor is the one with passion fruit. I also like the plain.I first tried coconut water in Brazil, where one simply buys an actual coconut. This is not quite the same, but it still has all the health benefits and is a good refreshing drink."
1,"Horible taste, nothing like a coconut","I have been drinking zico 12 packs regularly and decided to give this a try since it was on sale. The taste is no where near coconut water, even though zico isn't perfect, it beats vitacoco's taste by miles. Now, i grew up in coconut country so i do know the true taste of coconut water. Zico feels alot like the real deal, but vitacoco is mostly sugary (how can it be so sweet, that means its artificial. WOW i wonder how people give vitacoco 4 or 5 stars, may be the boxes that i got were the only ones with horrible taste, but i highly doubt that. I haven't tried O.N.E so don't know about that. Zico does it for me!"
1,Disappointed! Product Taste Is Inconsistent!,"I am a big fan of coconut water. We often buy young coconuts from our local grocery store to enjoy it.Late last year, I was introduced to this product by a friend. I loved the taste. I immediately ordered a 12 pack from Amazon and thoroughly enjoyed every last one of them.In my excitement I signed up for ""Subscribe & Save"" program and got a really good deal. I received two shipments and both were great!However the next shipment had a very bad taste! I am not sure how to describe it. I immediately got in touch with Amazon's Customer service and they sent me a replacement. (Amazon is the best!!!). The replacement had the same bad taste. I ended up throwing all of them in the trash (recycled all the containers).Product showed promise - Unfortunately they did not have good quality control measures in place! I guess its back to the local grocery store for me."
1,AWFUL,"OMG This stuff is AWFUL! Coconut? Someone said it had a grape aftertaste, Huh? It tastes like dirty toilet water. Puke. Awful. I have tried several different brands of coconut water and this was easily the worst. I would rate Zico the best that I have tried and O.N.E. at second."
1,Horrible! Didn't like the taste!,"Received the product, did not like the taste at all.Would not recommend the product.Lander6633"
1,Eeeeew terrible Gagged,I love done life water but walgreeens didn't have one so I got some and I web to take a sip andGagged it tasted rotten I had to dry but an get something to drink smells rotten too I want to like it considering I spent almost 3dollars
1,Nasty..............,"I read the reviews which were excellent. I purchased this product and almost gagged. I am still going to try to ""acquire"" the taste because I have 11 of them left and don't want them to go to waste."
1,small size,"Well, this is a review of size. Truth is it's on me for not recognizing what 11ounces is... Somehow I just expected them to be bigger. They are tiny. I assumed the size bigger for the price.oh well...And after tasting, it tastes sub par, but refreshing!"
1,Never..Never buy this...no matter whatever the price,"I purchased this for a deal price of 11 but was very much disappointed when I made the first sip.this not only stinks and makes you feel bad, the bad taste linger in your mouth tooI would never buy this again...no matter what ever the priceI tried to return but amazon do not have policy to return the groceries"
1,It is not coconut water,"I have drunk lot of time coconut water in my childhood because my neighbor was selling young coconut. I read review about VITA and I ordered it, but when I tried it was taste like jaggery water and so color. Usually young coconut water is white but not clear. I think vita is not using original coconut water. Though, it says on it box that pure coconut water. I would suggest buy young coconut box from asian market."
1,Coconut water,I have drank coconut water many times and this one tastes spoiled...I am not a fan of this one if this is the way it is suppose to taste
2,Where is the real taste?,"Too many good stars clouded my judgment based on experience. I'm an Asian and drink enough fresh coconut water to say this water is not pure and fresh as advertised. Even after several days in the refrigerator, the plastic like taste is still evidence. Real coconut water is very hard to keep it fresh as it turn sour very quickly. I guess they have to do something with the real thing to keep it non-perishable."
2,Vita Coco,"This looked like something I'd like so I gave it a shot. I really didn't like the taste of it, and others that I had try it didn't like it either."
1,Vita CoConut water gone Bad,"I purchased this product, a case of 12 in July of 2012, with a expiration date of April 2013. I recently put 6 in my home fridge and 6 in my office fridge and they were sickening. I have ordered this product numerous times, but this batch was horrible. It must have been placed in a high temperature or something. It made me sick to my stomach, terrible, terrible taste. I opened all 12 to check the smell and take a small taste and they were all bad. I also ordered a 12 pack of the pineapple flavored at the same time and will test them. If the first taste is bad, don't drink any more. It will make you very sick."
1,100% Pure is no longer,"I'm an Amazon Subscribe & Save Vita Coco buyer but will be switching brands. While fortunately for me the last shipment still states 100% pure, the Vita Coco website has changed that designation and now lists fruit sugar as one of the ingredients. Notice too that the picture on Amazon has also changed - it no longer has a container with ""100% pure"" listed on it. I was fortunate in that my last shipment was the 100% pure, but it looks like that won't be the case going forward. What a shame. Vita Coco may be slightly less expensive than some of the other brands, but if it's not 100% coconut water then it's a moot point. If I wanted sugar water, I'd buy soda."
1,RANCID,"What more can I say? The WHOLE case was RANCID, and my husband and I, are NOT happy. Lucky that we tried the drink before our very young Grandchildren did, that is all I am going to say about that."
2,I didn't care for it,"I bought this as a treat mostly for my sister-in-law, who is Indonesian. Unfortunately none of my family cared for the product. Mom and I thought it weak and I probably wanted it to be sweeter. My sister-in-law has of course had the real thing fresh from the coconut but she says she knows where to get something she prefers to this particular product.The little juice-boxes with pull-off openings were extremely keen."
3,"Good, but not the best","I love the taste of coconut water, and this one is just okay. The Zico Pure brand is much better."
5,vita coconut,"Great product at a great price. Have used the coconut water plain and in smoothies and other drinks. I wasn't sure if I like the taste of it plain at first, but now I really enjoy it. The flavored varieties are also good. I've ordered the variety pack to try different flavors."
2,Nothing like the real thing,"Having just gotten back from an equatorial country and drinking fresh cracked coconut water from the coconut, I can say that this is sub-par.Sure, it is packaged, but I am still surprised how poor it tastes.My wife refuses to drink them, and I am going to just have to slam them in the name of the health claims."
2,Taste Nirvana is so much better.,"I drank this product from time to time during long cycling rides, but since discovering Taste Nirvana I'll never go back. This at times tasted overly salty and lacked a pleasant coconut flavor and smell you get from higher quality coconut water."
3,Not Consistent With Taste,"I haven't read through all of the reviews, so I'm wondering if we are the only ones with this problem. When we first ordered the Vita Coco, my son loved it. However, our most recent case (actually 2 cases) did NOT taste the same as the previous ones. It was 'off' enough that I canceled our subscription."
1,Worst so far!,"I just had a Vita Coco and I have to say that it was the worst, funkiest-tasting coconut water I have ever had. It had a not even remotely sweet, sour taste. Maybe that is because of the addition of Vitamin C, which the best brands don't add. Frankly, I would like my water to be as close to drinking it straight out of the coconut as possible. Harmless Harvest has THE BEST, freshest tasting coconut water I have ever had, but I can only find it at FreshDirect.com and Whole Foods, and it is expensive and perishable. Close behind that is Taste Nirvana--my go-to choice for shelf stable water. Since Amazon doesn't sell Harmless Harvest, Taste Nirvana is the brand I buy. I don't really like Zico that much, but even it is quantum leaps ahead of Vita Coco."
1,Beware!!! No Returns on Coconut Water,"I bought two packages of coconut water. When they arrived they were very hot--must have been sitting in the boiling hot UPS truck.The coconut water was awful!!! It tasted nasty. Tried to return to amazon but there is a ""no-return"" policy for this item.Don't make my mistake. AVOID BUYING COCONUT WATER FROM AMAZON!!!"
2,"Bad packaging, coconut water spoiled inside!","I've been drinking VITACOCO regularly, great taste and great price too! Unfortunately, recently, the last few boxes have been very disappointing. The coconut water was spoiled, turned brown, and smell very very bad. I poured it into a glass (usually I would drink it from a container) and found out that all of the spoiled ones were caused by a piece or two of rotten coconut meat (flesh) mixed into the water inside.I haven't called Amazon yet, hopefully I can get a replacement. However, I went ahead and canceled my subscription already. Once my stock (I have about 3 boxes left) run out, I'll start looking into new brand of coconut water..."
1,"NOTHING like ""real"" cocoanut water","I wanted to like it- ran to Whole Foods to try it~ tried both popular brands- has a salty,rather putrid taste. UGH!! Surely this is nor ""real"" cocoanut water. I drink ""REAL"" cocoanut water/milk since i live in Florida. And- i understand this won't taste as good however- AAGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AWFUL!!"
2,Stale and salty compared to the real thing,"I just opened my first box, and I have to say that I'm really disappointed with this, especially considering the other reviews. Fresh coconut water has a delicate flavor, but this product ends up tasting flat and old, like something that has been left out in the sun too long (or pasteurized too aggressively). It has a bit of an off and funky flavor, and is notably sour in an unnatural way. It also tastes *really* salty, probably from the 680mg of potassium.Coconut water doesn't have to be this way. I pop top cans of coconut water from asian groceries that are twice the size and half the price of these boxes, and those taste great and the way I expected. Maybe I just got a box that sat in the corner overlooked for a while."
1,Tastes nothing like coconut,"One reviewer described his case of Vita Coco Coconut Water as bad tasting sweet and sour water. Based on the reactions of those who sampled from our case, the description is apt.I understand from recent reviews that coconut water is an acquired taste. Fair enough. For those who love coconut water this sounds like a fantastic deal. Our family and friends, however, can't down one of these, let alone think about two. Descriptions range from 'gross' to 'not my cup of tea' to 'its bad'. We can't give the stuff away.So don't repeat our mistake and assume that you're going to like this stuff if you like the taste of coconut. (Our batch tasted nothing like it.)"
3,ONE taste more fresh,"I started drinking coconut water as a natural way to replenish since I get dehydrated very easily. I buy the Vitacoco brand only when the ONE brand is more expensive. Doing a side by side taste test, I find the Vitacoco tastes just slightly sour (because it has added vit C, while the ONE brand does not add anything to its coconut water). Also, Vitacoco does not taste as fresh to me as ONE. But that said, the taste difference is very slight between the two brands, so i purchase both interchangeably, depending on sale price."
3,Vita Coco review,"Nice product... The taste is good and not too ""sugary"" like other products in the market. Unfortunately, the price suddenly increased by 40% after my first purchase so I will not be buying it again."
2,Horrible deal,"Save your money, just stop by the local ""chinese grocery store"" and buy ""Parrot"" brand coconut water. I've been using it for years now and its waaaaaay cheaper. Tastes just as great."
4,A great natural water drink.,"I just started drinking this about 1 year ago. I have had only actual coconut water from a real coconut, overall the bottled coconut water isn't quite as tasty but it's close. I have compared this product to 2 other brands, one of which was a ""raw"" coconut water product and much more expensive.The water tastes slightly sweet, my packaging reads that it has 11 grams of sugar per serving - this could be natural. It also states on my packaging there is Vitamin C which is listed as an additional ingredient. I have tried 2 other similar products on the market. Overall considering quality, packaging and price this is a great choice. If you haven't tried it give it a try. I have found this at Wegmans for around $10.00 for a 4-pack and I have found the same 4-pack at Walmart for $4.00. I hope you will find this review helpful. Thanks..."
3,good but can be better,i wish this tasted better but unfortunately it was very sweet and was not very thirst quenching. I know some people who love this liquid but it is not me at this time.
4,viva vita!,"love the product..Natural and much better for you than soda and beverages.. and at this remarkable price it can't be beat,a no brainer if ever I saw one!"
1,Very poor. __Bad taste and must be rotten.,"Product arrived in great condition. But, taste was very bad. it was yellow color and very bad taste. I think one of the other reviewer mentioned that.I am never buying perishable food from amazon again. I should have listen to other reviewer."
2,Not Fresh,"After drinking coconut water directly from a coconut a couple of weeks ago, I was dying to have it on a regular basis w/o the hassle of opening real coconuts. So when I saw this, I had to have it. Before my Amazon delivery came, I purchased some from my Whole Foods market in the neighborhood. The one I bought from Whole Foods was so delicious - just like the water straight from a fresh coconut. However, when I received my Amazon order of the Vita Coco - it was sour and not very tasty. I won't return it as it will cost too much to ship back, but definitely buy this from a market, not online. The difference is night and day. Vita Coco makes a great product, but only when it's fresh."
1,inconsistentcy with the taste..will not take the chance again.,I have purchased 3 cases of the coconut water on 3 different dates. The first two were fantastic but the 3rd case was nasty....I would not take the chance and buy it by the case again from amazon even though its cheaper because Amazon doesn't accept return for this item.
2,Tasted like sour milk,"The shipping was quick and the packaging great, but the product tasted terrible. It tasted like sour milk. I wish it tasted better, since it seems to be very healthy for you."
1,Not same quality,"Doesn't taste the same as the ones brought from Costco. The flavor is bitter, and the coco water color is not clear but rather yellow. Has a bitter taste. Would not buy this from amazon again."
1,doesnot taste good at all,"These doesn't taste good at all.I bought them before also in costco,they are good. But not the ones I got from amazon.Donot buy them here.Maybe this Batch is not good.I will never buy them here.I will not give 1 star also"
3,Real coconut water has 0% vitamin C. Vita has 230% vitamin C.,"clearly Vita Coco is NOT 100% coconut water. in contrast, Naked Coconut has no added supplements. i suspect vitamin C is used as a preservative since when i compared the expiration dates on the supermarket i noticed that Vita Coco expires April 2013, whereas Naked Coconut expires November 2012. you can taste some distant sourness due to vitamin C, which takes a way from the real flavor of coconut water. i'm actually okay drinking this, but if Naked Coconut Water wasn't so expensive I would rather have that over Vita."
1,This stuff is awful; read online about this before you order,"This Vita CoCo is not what it's advertised; go online and read for yourself before you order. It is not at all good, either, tastes a slight bit salty with added Vitamin C (now why did they go and do that!!!).Instead of this, buy the very delicious Taste Nirvana Real Coconut Water (and I buy the one with real pulp). It is absolutely wonderful. If you buy on auto-ship, you'll save $4 per carton."
2,Spoilt,The coconut water was spoilt. Maybe I just got a bad batch but I will be shopping a different brand. It does not help that I cannot return the unusedboxes.
1,I've had better...,"I was a bit disturbed at how bad this coconut water tasted. I shared with a few friends and family who came over to my house and none of them could stand another sip, after the first. (And I had refrigerated it too, which I thought would enhance the taste). We won't be using this coconut water for drinking as is... but will use it in baking and cooking. It's too darn expensive to waste it. Not a happy consumer of this product!"
1,NOOOOO!,"I bought this yesterday and put it in my fridge for overnight cooling. Picked it up today to drink it nice and cool, but the problem was its horrible taste.It tasted something like toilet water. Has a bad taste AND a bad aftertaste. I thought it would be good after its numerous commercials with Rihanna and its Costco sponsorship, but no, it's just plain horrible coconut juice."
2,really not fond of the taste,"The taste isn't nasty, but its really not that good. It better be healthy if it doesn't taste good so this is definitely selling point for this product"
2,I do not like it. It is not as good as O.N.E.,It has a whang to it that is nasty. I just got it today and I do NOT recommend this Coconut water. O.N.E beats it 100 percent.
2,Vita co co,"I love coconut water but the last few boxes have been very disappointing. The coconut water was spoiled, and smell very very bad. Please cancel my future orders I will NEVER order this product again"
5,Vignette,"I agree with the other reviewers that this performance of the Quartet for the End of Time is the best available. It is difficult to find words to say about this most elevating and moving composition, so I will share a vignette. In 1982 I played this recording, on vinyl, one Sunday morning for my girlfriend (now my wife). Long after it was over, when it was possible once more to speak, she broke the silence with these words: ""This is what God listens to on Sunday morning."""
5,Unique and Interesting,"Oliver Messiaen's music takes some getting used to. It's not unlike some of Stravinsky's works, but doesn't quite fit into any particular category. This particular work was written in a German prison camp and first performed there in 1941. Some people might want to buy it just for the historical significance, but I encourage you to buy it because it is downright interesting and enjoyable music. This might not be the best first album to buy as an introduction to Messiaen, as it's not his best work. It is somewhat subdued music; not particularly upbeat or awesome. It's not meant to be. Still well worthy of 5-stars."
3,Not overly impressed,"I bought this CD expecting to be transported the way I was with an old LP recording (by whom I do not remember) in student days. I wish I could name what I don't like about the current CD and performers. There's a lack of passion, but I don't know how to define that. Here's a tiny thing: the lack of pitch articulation in the important final clarinet note of the first movement. The pitch is there. But you have to work for it. In summary: the work is played fine. But I don't think it's a fabulous rendition."
3,Superb rendering of banal music,"Yes, indeed, the playing by Tashi is superb. The problem is that this really is a tedious, slow-moving, uninteresting piece. Messiaen is unpopular for a reason.Let's face it: if it weren't for this piece of music's back story, it would have to stand on its own merits. And on those merits, the piece is simply not very good."
1,End of Time should've ended Messiaen's career!,"I just heard this composition played live yesterday at a concert. HORRIBLE! I don't care who this composer was, where he wrote it, or why. It is garbage. Atonal, discordant, so bad I wanted to plug my ears. It sounded like a bunch of blind monkeys were tossed into a cell with pots, pans, lids, spoons, and maybe a xylophone for good measure. I finally succumbed to a fit of hysterical laughter - the music was simply SO embarrassingly pretentious and worthless, I was convulsed with laughter at my own bad fortune being stuck there at the concert till intermission - when I BOLTED.Intellectuals will rave about this piece, the composer, his sob story, how it premiered on a bitterly cold night in a concentration camp. But let's get real here: this ain't classical, and it ain't music. And folks who claim to love this piece are phonies and fakes. It doesn't even rate ONE star, but I put it there just so folks know I'm not kidding.'nuf said."
4,"Minor issues, excellent bass","I purchased this for my husband for Christmas. Being that I am not a musician in any form of the word I was unable to test it out when I received it. Upon playing it my husband noticed a bad fret. This wasn't a huge problem, as we have a local family that repairs guitars. He also wanted to put another nob on for the strap. I wasn't aware they come with only one by design.It turns out the frets were not glued in properly so they had to redo that then it sounded fantastic. We only paid about $56 to have that done and the extra nob put on. Still totally worth it.My husband enjoys that it has a satin finish on the back of the neck as well. He's had no complaints since the repair and loves playing it."
4,Met my expectations,"I have been playing bass guitar for six years now and although I have a nice electric bass, I wanted something that would allow me to wander a bit more away from the sixty pound amp I have. When I found this guitar and played it, I knew it was the one for me! The acoustic sound of it is spot on with what I was hoping for. It delivers very nice low, medium, and high ranges for a very affordable price. The one ""drawback"" of this product is that it does not sound as good as an electric bass when it is plugged into an amp. This is primarily because the mic in the guitar picks up the sound of fingers switching frets a lot more that magnetic pickups will. I expected this to be the case ahead of time so that was no real disappointment to me. Overall this guitar is a great deal and I would strongly recommend it to both beginners and more experienced bassists. It delivers kick-butt quality and keeps it at a low price!"

3,i went cryin to my mama this thing hurts woops i lied this thing kind of sucks,"mmmm, fyf, fyfpros- it as an average everyday mag it holds 15 bbs which is good for a spring pistol, its pretty accurate for a glock i give the accuracy a 3/5,cons- you have to be 2ft away to get somebody to feel the pain,i seriously had to freakin tie the slide to a tree branch and jump off to get it to cock you would get your butt kicked if you were going agianst an aeg"
3,Um... where's the suppressor?,"Ok, as you can see here in the picture that AMAZON.COM has for this item, you see that it's a great HFC Airsoft Glock 17 replica. So it probably comes with the usual refinements that HFC is classic for: Heavy weight; realistic look and feel, locking slide (always a HUGE selling point for me), and a nice, heavy hi-cap mag. Basically another high-quality/low-price HFC spring gun. And so I ordered it from here because, from the PICTURE, it looks like it comes with a bonus item: a classic long-barrel suppressor.Lo and behold, when I receive it...No suppressor.I'm not REALLY complaining, because the gun itself is beautiful. Another great piece of HFC merch.But if you're going to show a picture of something you're selling, make sure that it comes with everything in the picture."
5,Is the Gun Black or Orange?!?,"Is this gun Black or Orange? Beause im looking for a gun that needs to be Realistic looking, & that has the same dimmensions as this one!"
3,"Looks good, cheaply made",I love glocks so I bought this airsoft gun. Its a cool novelty but it is cheaply made. The barrel is plastic and the accuracy isn't the best. It does shoot fairly hard but even .20 bb's have a fairly large curve. at 30+ feet.
2,It was ok when it WORKED,"When i revived this gun it was great, i thought it was a very great handgun. then after a while, the mag release button broke off, then the gun started to jam and wouldn't feed the BBs, then the orange tip fell off and looked WAY TOO REAL, i would order this form someone other than AIrsplat, they are very unreliable"
5,Mark Millar is a god among men,"I don't want to toot this horn again but man, Mark Millar just blows me away every time. I read his Wanted earlier this year and his run on the Ultimates has been amazing. But this Marvel Knights Spiderman run is just fantastic. He breathes new life and new excitement into a character with too many titles. He is an amazing character writer and Peter just leaps off the page as the tragic hero that he is. Aunt May and the villans and hottie Mary Jane just crackle and sizzle with life.All I can say is that if you are an adult Spiderman fan, then you've got to be reading this book and the rest of the first 12 issues. This is good writing, dark characters, violent action, and nitty-gritty goodness.'Nuff said!"
2,"Well-produced, ordinary, and... boring","At first listen, I was ready to like 'Angels and Cigarettes'. It's well-produced, and has some catchy hooks. The best CDs grow on you, getting better and better with every listen. This Eliza Carthy disc is not, unfortunately, one of those. By the third time through I was bored. There's nothing new nor original here. While the lyrics are interesting on the first listen, the music is repetative and totally expected. And that's really the problem with this disc. It sounds formulaic and pre-programmed. With so much original music out there, why bother?"
3,"grab a smoke, fly a kite","The three stars only refer to the songs I have heard. I just wanted to let folks who adored Kirsty Maccoll know that Eliza Carthy's new album shares many production and compositional qualities with Maccoll's work. Layered vocals, shimmering sounds, hints of world beat and hip-hop and folk. Her original lyrics are not quite on a par with Maccoll's, but her delivery is quite promising."
5,BRILLIANT,"I discovered this album without knowing about any of Eliza's previous music, so I don't have any preconceived notions of what this is ""supposed"" to be. All I know is this: I own a music store with thousands of CDs, and we play music all day long, 7 days a week, and this is the most beautiful album I've listened to this year, and it ranks up there among the best I've heard in the last five years. Who cares if it's not the same as what she's done in the past? This music is brilliant."
4,Widening the Panama Canal,"This account (on DVD) is extremely well done in describing the necessity for and the challenging engineering process to increase the width of the Panama Canal channel and building 2 new super locks to better handle the enormous ships presently being built. The factual information is interesting, well presented, and accurate. The photography is magnificent."
3,"Cute and it works, but requires getting used to","This bird peeler is really cute and feels pretty good to hold. However, the beak has a stronger curve than typical peelers and the tip tends to hit the apple (or whatever you're peeling) so that the peeler suddenly catches. You have to keep adjusting the angle of the peeler to keep the end of the beak from touching the apple. Other than that, the peeler works fine."
5,My opinion,"The ""bird"" peeler....was purchased as a gift........they were so ""cute"",,,,,,I purchased a couple of more.....the recipients were ecstatic..........and loved them...........B.A.H., from Humboldt county"
5,YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THIS BOOK HAS A CULT FOLLOWING,"People who love Legend, really love it. It's surprising that a book which has received so little notice, a book released from a minor publisher like this, has managed to even survive for all these years much less generate a dedicated following. But what you read it you can understand. It's hardly my favorite book of all time, but it is a great read, and when you finish it, I'm willing to bet that you'll find yourself smiling."
