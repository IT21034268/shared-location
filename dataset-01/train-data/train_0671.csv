4,"Beautifully filmed, Interesting","This is definitely a beautiful, well-filmed movie. The story stays a bit of a mystery throughout. Ms. Rampling is quite good. When I looked at her career and the movies in her filmography, I was surprised to see that such a fine actress really hasn't been in that many good movies. Not a young woman anymore, Ms Rampling is still very alluring. This film has a few erotic moments, but not to the degree that some reviewers are stating. If you like a thought-provoking type of character study and a beautiful loking film this could be a good one for you."
4,grief in all its forms,"Brilliant. When her husband goes missing, Marie (the exquisite Charlotte Rampling, who has elevated the composed, cool woman with underlying problems to an art form) will not relent in her search. When he is clearly gone, she will not fully let go or move on. She lives in a state of psychological limbo in which she lets others acknowledge the loss while she neither confirms, denies or believes what is clear. Her involvements in life after the loss of her husband are tainted by the memory of her husband, who for her is still quite real. Her grief, instead of traveling the normal path of eventual acceptance, drives her further into a madness born of denial."
2,Typical French movie,"I liked this movie when I started watching it. I remember thinking: please, let this be a thriller with a surprise ending!But no, it turned out to be just another typical eccentric French brain flatulence where you keep wondering what the heck it is all about. I used to hate French movies, but I have seen a few good ones lately, so there is hope. Two stars because I did not hate the first few minutes."
2,very stagnant,"I like Francois Ozon's Swimming Pool a lot. I think he has caught a very exceptional line in that movie. But Under the Sand is a very typical French movie which makes most people don't want to watch one as soon as they hear it is a French movie. I finally persuaded my husband that Francois Ozon is different and this movie will be good, it turned out to be a nightmare, pointlessly soul strangeling movie. I would not recommend unless you are a big fun of Ozon or this type of movies."
4,Logitech 920-000526 Cordless Keyboard is a Wise Choice,"This Logitech 920-000526 Cordless Keyboard (and cordless mouse)performed as advertised. Although the mouse works great too, I am not a ""mouse person"" and prefer to use a trackball, so I wish it came with that option. I am using this as a replacement for the keyboard that came with my HP Pavilion a6300f PC and it enables me to kick back as I write pharmacist targeted books and newsletters. I believe the Logitech 920-000526 Cordless Keyboard and Mouse to be a great value."
1,Faulty mouse,"I got stuck with a faulty mouse, which doesn't rechearge its batteries. I was not able to return the product because I was 3 months in hospital (an open heart surgery - 5 bypasses).After I was back home, I found that the mouse was bad, but it was to late to return the package to Amazon. I called Logitech to replace the mouse. I was told that this product is not made any more..."
5,Stellar Book; A Real Investment,"Tom's ""Island to Oneself"" is a must read. It is a story that one can connect with regardless of background, social, economic or otherwise.Being a great fan of the south pacific I now have an even greater drive to remain a fan of that bright, hot and so alive place.My dream is to move to an island one day, maybe not in such remote and isolated conditions as Mr. Neale, but to `My Island' nonetheless.I was sad when Tom's story closed but have been motivated to seek other literary routes to islands south while I remain here temporarily `stranded' in my desert!God bless Mr. Neale's soul and may Tom forever rest in peaceI also recommend the following Great Island Stories (to name a few):""Island of Desire"" Robert Dean Frisbie""Man on His Island"" James S. Rockefeller Jr.""Lost Island"" James Normal Hall""Rascals in Paradise"" James A. Michener & A. Grove Day""Robinson Crusoe"" Daniel Defoe""Kon-Tiki"" Thor Heyerdahl""Tales of the South Pacific"" James A. Michener"
5,WONDERFUL ACCOUNT OF LIVING ALONE..,A wonderful book - this man lived alone on a small island and he tells of all the little things he had to do to survive. Also covers his interaction with one or two visitors who arrived from time to time. From start to finish it's compulsive reading.
5,an island to oneself,"I like this book, because it's pure escape ism, one man survives two three year sessions on a isolated pacific island, it's curous, and easy reading"
1,poorly,"I ordered this book as a present for my mother and as it turned out, the inside of the book was upside down and back to front, with loose pages. My mother thought i was having a joke with her. I am not impressed that i paid $30 for a book that my mother has to read back to front and turned upside down....some birthday present!"
5,A Real Life Fantasy,"For anyone with an independent soul who always wonders why they dont just quit their job and wander the world, open a tiki bar in the South Pacific, or rent surf boards on the beach, Tom Neale has one upped even those fantasies by living alone on a desert island. He truly did it right, and the book is an absolute pleasure to read and will transport you to the life you wish you lived."
5,"An adventurous, bold, and inspiring story.","""An Island to Oneself"" totally and completely captures the isolation, the beauty, and the peacefulness of island life in the South Pacific. It is sure to awaken the sense of adventure and challenge that usually lies dormant in most of us. Mr. Neal's adventure is a truely inspiring and triumpant tale."
5,Perfect,Received the blind today. Fit exactly to the windshield as expected. Does seem pretty sturdy. Product was received quickly and well packaged.
5,Sunshade for 2011 FJ Cruiser,Very nice product that fits so well (at least on the FJ) that you don't even need to use your sun visors to hold it up. It blocks the sun completely from coming in through the front windshield. I highly recommend this product.
4,Provides Perfect Shade!,This sunshade is custom fit for the Toyota Cruiser so it covers the entire windshield providing excellent shade and blocking out the heat. I love it!
1,too expensive,My horses love them but they last like 20 minutes maximum. That is not effective for the bottom line. Trying to make on my own.
2,Not very useful for me!,I tried many accent reduction series. This one is not so useful to me. The way she go over certain difficult sounds I have did not make sense (to my ears). It might work better for other accent (non Asian/Chinese). Very hard for me to distinguish some sounds from the tape.
1,Go for Ann Cook one!,"The title says all. Her book, American Accent Traning 2nd edition, is MUCH better than this book... I REALLY want to return this usuless book and cassettes... There are many serious and hardworking international students who suffer from their accents and trying to find a way to solve their problem. I believe this book is just making fun of these serious students... I can believe how this author can publish such a incompleted and useless book... this guy should ashemed of himself."
3,Don't cry wolf,Book editor is bitten by a werewolf after hitting in the road and his senses improve as well as he develops a thirst for killing things. Eventually moving onto people. Very sharply on target and tame for it's type with good make-up effects that almost influence the viewer to believe the characters ARE wolves. David Schwimmer has a cameo as a cop.
3,Flick,"This werewolf flick though worth a rental doesn't deliver scares or gore. Stars Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer. About a guy who is bitten by a wolf in the opening sequence. The Howling series is much better. Still, not bad."
4,A timeless legend !,"The well known legend of the werewolf has now been translated and adapted for the urban life; when a genteel book editor has been bitten by a wolf and some somber events begin to show through his messed personal crisis; excellent pretext to develop an ambitious movie that it might result too slow in case you just only expect a horror film. But there is so much to seek beneath the script.Formidable cast with Nicholson at the top, flanked by Michelle Pfeiffer, Christopher Plummer and James Spader, under the secure directorial hand of Mike Nichols."
3,Only Nicholson could pull this off!,"Generally a real good flick, but the slow motion effects detract from the whole thing. Jack Nicholson steals the show...hardly any makeup was needed to give him ""the look""! Good acting, good story line, fair special effects. A werewolf movie that actually has a happy ending!"
3,Nicholson and Spader duke it out for top wolf,"While on a snowy road, Jack Nicholson (Batman, The Shining) gets bit by a wolf. After that, he soon finds out that he can see without his glasses, he can hear people talking a mile away, he can smell people's scent. So, he finds out that his wife, Kate Nelligan, is having an affair with one of Nicholson's colleauges, played by James Spader (sex, lies and videotape, Dream Lover). Soon, Nicholson falls in love with beautiful Michelle Pfeiffer (Batman Returns, White Oleander) and soo Nicholson becomes interconnected with the full moon where he changes into a furry dog. Good werewolf tale with Jack Nicolson giving it all he has in his performance. Spader also gives a good one as well. Also starring Christopher Plummer (upcoming The New World, National Treasure), Richard Jenkins (Say It Isnt So, Changing Lanes), David Hyde Pierce (Fraiser, Hellboy), Ron Rifkin(Alias, The Negotiator) and look fast for David Schwimmer (Since You've Been Gone, Friends) as a Cop."
3,The 1st hour is great last is not,"I started to like this movie at first but then when James Spader tried to stea the movie, it just went down. Then I said this was not a succesful Nicholson movie."
2,When is a Wolf a Dog?,"A poor attempt at horror. The ""scary"" scenes seemed reminiscent of a 1970's made for TV movie. The storyline was very simple, no depth, no surprises. How or why did Nicholson and Pfeiffer get involved in this? The ending added up to a big nothing. Rick Baker, supreme make-up artist...looks like he just glued on some sideburns and dracula teeth. Even the Ennio Morricone soundtrack sounded like elevator music. If they left out the horror, and just focused on the young overambitious Spader squareing off against Nicholson in a high-level executive cutthroat job position fight, it would have been entertaining."
5,Recommend,"Good Jack Nicholson movie, not too scary and the special effects are pretty good. I am glad I got it."
3,good movie,"Great movie, so far removed from the Lon Channey werewolf classics. Great suspense with Jack Nicholson along with good effects."
3,Not a horror film. More like a middle-aged male fantasy.,"This isn't a horror film. It is a middle-aged male fantasy that thinks it's a horror film. Take a well paid white collar executive with a secretary and lackeys. Check. Who goes through a transformation that makes him feel young and vivacious again. Check. Who has a beautiful wife and an even more beautiful mistress. Check. Who's half his age. Check. And the ultimate fantasy, she's the boss' daughter. Check!It's not a bad movie. Just don't play spot the stunt double - it's far too easy. And don't expect a horror movie - it simply isn't one. It's an office drama with some supernatural elements thrown in."
4,Intelligent horror film/character study,"This is an interesting film, because it's partly a character study of a tired, middle aged publisher and partly a horror film about werewolves. Jack Nicholson plays a publisher about to lose his job to his friend and protege, who also happens to be sleeping with his wife. He seems too worn out to put up much of a fight, until he is bitten by a dying wolf, and begins to feel as if he has taken on its spirit. He also falls for the incredibly beautiful daughter of his boss (Michelle Pfeiffer). This movie has top notch acting, an intriuging story and a cool ending. I recommend it."
4,The Old Wolf,"Old story with vintage actors. Jack Nicholson, Michelle Pfeiffer and James Spader all do their best to carry this movie off. If you like them, you'll like this movie. Otherwise..."
4,A horror masterpiece!,"Very precise and neat in terms of direction and some fabulous acting from Nicholson, Spader and Pfeiffer. 'Wolf' is one of the very rare horror films that really keep you by the edge of your seat and eyes glued to the screen but hey! you can't just sit still, your head keeps spinning around, wondering what will happen next. The film drags on for a little longer time, but the neat direction and acting overcomes it. Jack Nicholson delivers a brilliant performance, his expressions alone are enough to convince the viewer. An unforgettable, tiny gem of a film."
1,Where is my order?,"Until today, 14/05/2012, I have not received it. I'm waiting to find out when the going to get!SDS. Vicente"
2,not a good werewolf movie,It is more of the lines a spirital werewolf movie then an regular werewolf movie. They actully don't turn into a werewolf but they act like one!
1,0 STARS: Utter trash.,"Jack Nicholson ought to be ashamed of himself for doing such trash as this movie called ""Wolf"". One of the reasons that this movie fails is because it so unconventional and nontraditional in werewolf lore. The real bottom line on this movie is that it is unbelievably boring from a horror movie fan's perspective. I don't know why, but some people call this movie a horror movie, but I just call it rubbish."
4,I saw a documentary on this on History Channel,AND THEY SAID IN IT THAT THE MANSION THAT HE (JONATHAN CARVER) USED TO OWN WAS HAUNTED BY HIS GHOST - THEY SAID THAT A FAMILY HAD BOUGHT THE OLD PLACE CALLED 'SUMMERWIND' THAT HAD SINCE BURNED DOWN BY LIGHTNING BUT THEY MENTIONED THAT THE MALES FATHER HAD HAD A REGRESSION WHERE HE WENT RIGHT TO THE PLACE IN THE BASEMENT THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE HELD THE DEED TO THE SUMMERWIND ESTATE AND THAT IT WAS IN A SMALL BOX BEHIND A WALL IN THE BASEMENT BUT WHEN HE WENT TO THE EXACT PLACE WHILE THE HOUSE WAS STILL STANDING HE STUCK HIS HAND INSIDE THE HOLE AND FOUND NOTHING BUT A BLANK SPACE.
2,comfotable but the top is too short.,I bought this to wear after my son was born but the top was too short and I was always pulling it down.
5,I really like it,"I bought this lovely card reader serveral weeks. it's really cool. just like a floppy drive, u insert the card, select files, cut, then paste. everythin is done. I use win2000, installation is easy, convenient. by the way, I use smart media card."
1,"WINDOWS ""ME"" COMPATABILITY..","Irecently upgraded???to me,and now cannot use this device.it freezes the cpu @ update h/w info.data base.the viking support group says""sorry we do not have nor do wee expect to have drivers win me is not listed assupported on the box or anywhere due to various issues with windows mewe cannotsupport the use of the reader with the os.this maay not be the proper forum for this event but all shoulld bbe aware."
5,Very good !,"I use it frequently to transfer pictures from my digital camera's compactflash card. It has two slots one for smartmedia and other for PCMCIA cards. Each slot appears as a drive letter under ""My Computer"". The compactflash card goes into an adapter which goes into the smartmedia slot.The read and write speed is very good.One problem I had - After installing the reader, I found that my Windows ME would hang during start up (on average once every 6-7 times). First I couldn't determine it was because of this reader, but then I discovered that the machine was hanging immediately after the red LED on the reader lits up. I downloaded the latest driver for this reader. It seems to have fixed the problem. The machine hasn't hung in two days."
3,Love it...but not with WindowsXP,"My IntelliFlash performed so well with my Dell 300MHz/Windows95 that I've bought 'em for other friends with digital cameras.However, be warned that if your computer runs WindowsXP AND if you have an Iomega Zip drive (mine is parallel, not USB), you may experience driver conflicts that will prevent easy simultaneous use of both devices. Viking tech support has not been able to help me through this other than to blame Iomega's drivers. And Iomega tells me that XP comes with their latest driver. So now what?Messy. And if it's not convenient to use this product...well, that's a problem."
2,"Great, unless you use Mac OS X","I work on a Macintosh and the reader is fabulous for moving photos from my digital camera. It became indispensable for me. But there are no drivers for Mac OS X, and Viking hasn't announced any plans for compatability. As a result, the ease-of-use that I bought the reader for has gone waaaay down."
4,Another Quality viking product,This thing allows you a grat deal of versatility. especially if you have a Compact Flash Digital Camera A laptop with a PCI card slot and a desktop computer. you can use it much like a zip drive. USB makes easy installation there are driver updates you can get at the viking website if you are running WIN 98
1,Viking Intelleflash USB Stick - useless,"The reader barely works with ME, it can only read and transfer the photos. Anything beyond this and you get blue screen errors. It hasa compatibility problem with 64 MB sticks which the company knows about but has no definate plans to fix. No XP drivers and no plans to upgrade. Viking does not support its customers. I, too, took a chance on this product. My DataFab reader using Sanddisk worked super - I should have stuck with them. Buyer beware!"
2,Disappointing product,"I was pretty disappointed for the following reasons: 1- It is bulky when compared to equivalent readers on the market 2- I expected transfer rates for Compact Flash cards of 1MB/s, but the average is around 300kB/s, which is the transfer rate attained by connecting directly the camera to a PC using a USB cable. 3- CF cards are hard to take out, as the eject button takes the PCMCIA adapter out of the reader, instead of ejecting the CF card. However, I was happily surprised by its ease of installation it terms of drivers, and by the presence of a PCMCIA adapter."
4,"All things considered, pretty good","I'm using this product with my Canon ELPH digital camera. It is really convenient to be able to pop a flash card in and download all the pictures at once. I only have a few nits...For some reason, the drive doesn't work if there are other items plugged into USB ports at the same time. The other thing to keep in mind is that if your camera has a USB connection to begin with, the pictures will download pretty fast, so you don't have to worry that much about battery life (translation: your money may be better spent on higher capacity compact flash cards). Other than that, it's a great product."
2,Don't try it with Windows XP!,"I found that this product worked exceptionally well with Windows 98. However, when I upgraded to Windows XP, I could not install it even though Viking has an XP download for it (Intelliflash_XP). I contacted Viking and was told that my computer needed upgrading by th manufacturer. (No such upgrade exists). I think that I'll have to buy another unit. I won't be Viking!"
3,3 media types is misleading,"This device really only reads SmartMedia and full size PCMCIA media. BUT they include a Compact flash to PCMCIA adaptor. In a way this is nice because I can use the adaptor with out the USB device in my laptop, but it is a pain using compact flash because you have to eject the adaptor then remove the compact flash from the adaptor.The photo and description should be changed to include this information!"
1,Worked great with Windows 98 but will NOT work with XP!,"I had an older Pentium II 400 running Windows 98 when I bought this item. It worked great and I would have rated it 5 stars. However, I recently purchased a new top-of-the-line Pentium 4 from Dell (awesome by the way), which was of course loaded with Windows XP. I have since wasted countless hours trying to get this drive to work under XP. My system will simply not recognize the drivers -- even the newest XP driver downloaded from Viking's website. All of my other hardware peripherals connected beautifully under XP. After spending time on the phone with Viking support, I was more frustrated than ever. There are much better (and cheaper) alternatives at your local Best Buy or Circuit City. I bought a SimpleTech CF reader for $[money] at Circuit City that works beautifully with XP. Go in another direction!"
3,Excellent product once installed.,"The product does work as advertised, however; I had a difficult time installing the drivers during the setup process. I'm running Windows ME, and noticed that the manufacture placed the drivers in the windows ""inf"" directory, not the system directory which is generally the default. So, after manually pointing to the proper directory the product installed without fault.The product was recognized as a ""General Purpose USB Hub"" and created two new drive letters. This allows tremendous versatility. You can open and edit pictures directly on the ""smart media"" memory card or simply copy them to your local hard drive.Overall, I would recommend this product to friends, but gave it a 3 because the manufacture needs better support (i.e. FAQ pages) and automated installation."
2,"Should plug and play, doesn't.","Don't take my word for it, go to the Viking web site and see the number of folks who are not getting the results they expected from the user's manual (which I must admit is over-simplified to a fare-thee-well). I plugged the darling into my iMac G4, fully expecting to do a little tinkering, but found out after a lot of trial and error, a misleading interview with a tech support guy, and an exhaustive search of said web site that it doesn't work with OS 9.1, let alone OS X.Such a pity, because the idead is sound. If anyone knows of a rival product that does the job, post it please."
5,Very fast picture transfer but download new zip disk drivers,"This device worked great once for my 3.34 megapixel downloads, but then I had a problem getting it to work. I called Viking tech support and found out that older versions of IOMEGA zip drivers were not compatible -- my zip's drivers thought Viking drives were zip drives. Once I downloaded new drivers for IOMEGA and reinstalled Viking drivers I could again download off my Smartmedia cards at lightening speed."
2,Beware the Blue Screen of Death,"When it works, it works flawlessly. When it doesn't... well, let's say it isn't very pretty. Rebooting with the card reader plugged into the USB port on a Win2000 box will consistently lead to a Blue Screen of death. Reader has to be plugged in AFTER Windows boots which is a drag. Not bad overall, but there has to be better out there."
1,This product does not work as advertised.,"I was led to believe by Viking's web site that this product would work with Windows 2000 and at their webpage they say that Windows 2000 WILL work with this product. It does not. I spoke to Viking's tech support and they indicated that this product might not actually be ready for Windows 2000. In other words, they lied about their product on their website and their tech support is clueless. They may be planning to make this Win2K compliant one of these days, but in the meantime, save your money..."
3,Does not support standby mode per viking tech-sup,"I like the reader and it works well and is easy to install. However, once installed, my Windows 2000 system can no longer go into standby mode. I emailed Viking about this and I did get a very prompt reply, unfortunately not what I wanted to hear:At 01/11/2001 03:16 PM we wrote - The IntelliFlash does not support suspend or standby modes. It is seen by Windows as a removable drive and therefore is constantly being monitored. As such, it cannot be suspended. I'm sorry, but there is no work-around other than unplugging the reader.They seem to be wanting to blame Windows and I know its not a windows limitation but a problem with their driver. Hopefully they'll fix it sometime. Until then, I'd recommend shopping around before buying this reader."
4,Damn good music.,"it's good, but I wish Tresa Jordan would just let it go and have fun. it's a little too safe for my taste. Let it rip!"
1,Not Durable at all,This lasted ONE day. Then the seam seperated and we had to throw it away. This was a total waste of money. It would have been a cute idea if constructed better.
1,down right awful,"If you like fluffy bunny new age crap,then this book is for you. However if you like reality then overlook this book. The part that made me the angriest was when she said that it was okay to kill plants for food,but not animals,and that we didnt need protein in our diet. If you want to eat,you have to kill something to eat,unless you want to destroy your body by putting artificial substances in it. This book was so awful that I couldnt even finish it."
4,yes what did happen to Sally,"I am currently reading Star signs - I am heavyly into numerology at the moment and find it very interesting what Linda has to say about that. It is a heavy book and it will take a long time to digest it so I am reading bits by bits - and really enjoying it. I am also curious to know what did happen to her daughter Sally...that is the only problem about this interesting book - LG sometimes leaves out a bit of information or wanders off, where it is sometimes difficult to follow her.. But a great book"
3,Reasonable purchase,i bought this book for my incarcarated friend he wanted some books to read i was glad i could find a reasonable price for them. It was shipped directly to him without a problem.
3,"Good Start, Fair Middle, and then Weirdness","I was and am turned off by Ms. Lackey's use of unusual and outre' sexual mores. This is especially not appropriate in an author whose early reputation was founded in fiction oriented towards juveniles. Its just too tacky. ""Other than that Mrs. Lincoln the play was OK."""
5,Beautiful,"This is very, very similar to Winds Triology in that that it refines the lines of magic. I loved it. I would like to see more of Freehold and the Deliambren Fortress city, soon. One thing, though: Nighingale and T'fyrr sound like Darkwind and Elspeth!"
5,Salve for the soul,"Following the death of our 39 year old daughter I was having trouble sleeping. However, the night I read this book I was overcome with a sense of peace and slept like a baby. John Claypool is a master of words, scripture and emotions ... pulling them together in a wonderfully readable manner. This is a ""must read"" for grieving parents. Rev. Claypool has given us a great gift which has grown out of his own personal pain."
5,A Gift Needed For All,"John Claypool's honest about his pain after the death of his daughter. From the pulpit he does his congregation a favor by sharing his anguish with them, not hiding from it or trying to sugar-coat it. With Claypool's freedom to show his honest feelings, others who are forced onto the same parental bereavement path after the death of a child, can learn that ""strugglers making tracks,"" need to be ""given permission"" to freely grieve. Congregations everywhere should have this book as required reading. How much more effective and kind (and Christ-like)we can all be when we understand a parent's broken heart. A friend sent Claypool's book to me shortly after the death of my own son and I have found the writing to be just what I needed."
5,News You Can Use,"There are so many platitudes out there for a person wrestling with the angel of grief. Unlike all those false paths, this book produces a blessing.John Claypool climbs into the circle of powerlessness felt by everyone experiencing grief, particularly those who know the heartbreak of grieving over the loss of children. After one has tried all the other paths to living with grief, he offers a path to hope. For many, this book has been a sanity saver."
5,Tracks,"Quality words from a gifted writer and orator. I suggest this book to anyone who has lost a loved one, especially one who is taken at an early age."
5,Hope,"We recently experienced the crushing feelings of extreme grief in the death of our 22year old son. Someone lent me this book because they had found solace and comfort in reading this book. They had also dealt with the death of a child. I found a lot of answers to help me deal with the grief and hopefully heal someday. The last two chapters helped me the most. They helped me find one of the elements that has been missing from my life in the past few months and that is ""hope""."
4,Provided a different perspective,"The book is short but powerful. With some friends that are grieving from the loss of children, it helped me to try to understand their grief. Although I can't fully understand, it helped. Thanks for the insight."
1,Does not work with Hygeia Pumps,"Just so you know, this product does not work with the hygeia pump. I know there are not many hygeia pumpers out there but just in case, save yourself the time and the money and don't buy it as it does not convert for the hygeia threading. The packaging does not indicate that it will work, it does not list Hygeia at all."
4,awesome product,when I decided to nurse my baby I knew that I was going to need to fine some thing to store my breast milk. I saw the avent storage kits but those only work for avent breast pumps and I saw the gerber zip lock bags but those just looked like a pain and then I saw the playtex and I knew thats what I wanted because I love playtex bottles I knew this had to be a great product and it is. I can just pump right in to the liners and put a ring on it and put it in the freezer and be done with it. I like the fact that its not alot of hassel because pumping takes enough time as it is let alone haveing to wash a bottle to store it. I also think that it warms up quicker under hot water then it would in a bottle. The only problem that I have come across is that the rings have been craking in the freezer other than that its perfect also it fits perfectly with my medela breast pump.
2,Does not work with Avent pumps,"I bought this kit because I have been using an Avent pump and pouring the milk into the Playtex system (a pain which kind of defeats the purpose of having a pre-sterilized system, but the pump makes me happy and the Playtex nurser makes my baby happy). I bought this kit excited that I could use the adapter and just pump straight into the Playtex drop-ins. However, it is only ever mentioned in small print on the box that the adapter does not work with Avent and First Years pumps. Since these are two popular brands, I wish they'd note that on the Amazon site and more prominently on the box!"
5,I LOVE THIS!!,It saves so much time when pumping for a fresh bottle! I use storage bags for breastmilk that I am storing! This is so convenient
3,easy to use but flawed idea,"I have this set and although it's easy to use with my Medela pumps (electric and manual), I rarely use it unless all my bottles are full, because you can't see the top of the bag to know when to safely stop pumping without overfilling. Thus I can't pump as much in one session as I do with storage bottles, unless I stop and change out the bag. You end up only filling each one 2/3-3/4 full and use up more bags this way. I do love the drop-ins system and that's what I use to feed baby when I'm away from her, but I pump into bottles, not into this set."
3,Pick Your Job - and Land It,"This is an old book, but offers inspiration and specific details on positively seeking a better job. The stories were refreshing and motivational. The advice is a shot in the arm and a push to focus and go for what you desire."
3,May cause allergic reaction,"I used this with my first Maltese, who had minor eye staining and it worked wonderfully if used regularly. My current dog (also a Maltese) has horrible eye staining. This still helps get rid of particle build up from the yeast, but it doesn't make the redness go away completely as it did with my first dog. So if you have a white dog that has significant staining, this will not get rid of it. He doesn't rub at his eyes as much if I am using it regularly, though, so this is still the product I choose to use for him and I am pretty happy with it.However, I used this on my mom's dog (a poodle) for 2-3 days in a row and her eyes swelled. We weren't sure what it was from initially, but when I used this product again on her, her eyes swelled again, so I know this is the product that caused it. As with anything, please pay close attention when you start using something new and discontinue use if you see side effects."
4,Great lotion...except...,"I have not purchased this lotion online but have in a salon many times. I think this is one of the best lotions out there. Great color, no streaking, no orange hands, the smell going on is great. HOWEVER, after you tan, the smell is terrible. My husband (Mr. Brutally Honest) said that it gave off an combination odor of urine and heavy duty floor cleaning product. It was even worse once the water from the shower touched it. It was fine after the shower, great moisture & I didnt find that I hit a color plateau which was great. It came to be that I would only be able to use the lotion when I had no other plans after tanning and where I wasnt going to be around anyone to offend them & their olfactory nerve."
3,Indoor Tanning Lotion,I'm not too impressed with this lotion. I used it twice and haven't noticed any difference. The smell is kinda weird. Think I need to get something with a bronzer in it next time.
5,My review on this product..,I have used this product before. I was paying way too much for one bottle at a local tanning shop. I found this product to be the cheapest here compared to anywhere else online. Two bottles plus shipping was less than one bottle from the place I was originally buying it from! Took one week to receive the product. Overall happy to have used Amazon for my purchase.- Scott
2,For Elvira-fans only?,"""Blue Sunshine"" is a serious nice little Thriller.""Monstroid"" is pure trash as trash can be.It's a shame for some great actors to be in it.But anyway,no one buy these DVD's for the movies.Only for the Mistress of the Dark - ELVIRA!!!"
2,Out of date and abbreviated travel book,"I haven't even left for Shanghai yet and I know this book is a disappointment in comparing it with my friend's Lonely Planet and doing some quick online research. It said there weren't any youth hostels (there are several) and the book is lacking a metro map and even a decent street map! The ""exploring Shanghai"" section is embarrassing small, I don't know if I would be able to keep myself occupied during my visit if this were to be my only guide."
4,Easy overview,"This book gives you an easy overview over attractions and the maps are quite fullfilling. Really a good guide book.It could just be me, but I think there is to much info on hotels and restaurants. I'm normally the person to think ""there is a lot of people in that restaurant we just passed - Lets go eat there"". Regarding hotels I tend to book from home at the internet and just need the star rating, the website and ""tips on how to get the best rate"".But if you flip through the hotel and restaurant pages, everything looks to be squeezed in and if you need it - then you REALLY need it - I guess that I would be really angry, if I ended up stranded in Shanghai without a good hotel listing ;-)So the only negative I have is the quality of the paper. I think you will wear the book down if you go a lot to Shanghai.Ole, Denmark"
2,Neighborhood maps are not integrated,"I bought this guide because it was the most recent one available at my local bookstore. I have yet to try it on the ground in Shanghai, but I will update this review if my opinion changes.I'm disappointed that the maps in general are not integrated. The overview map of Shanghai doesn't show you the pages for the individual neighborhood maps. Similarly, the individual neighborhood maps don't show you hints to the maps for surrounding pages. Frommer's should look at how Lonely Planet guides do this. There's no copyright on doing maps that are easily tied together.For me, finding a good hotel means it should be close to a subway station. In particular, I wanted to find a hotel on the Line 1, because I need to make frequent visits to the northwest. Although there is a subway map on the inside cover of this guide, there are no stations shown on the overview map of Shanghai. The guide does not make this task easy."
2,Poorly designed,"The maps make it very hard to figure out where you are, and all the pages look alike. You'd be much better served with the Time Out or Lonely Planet guides."
3,Hmm.,"Previous was much, much better. I'd give Birds Flying Away a 5 star rating.Hopefully this isn't Mason Jennings trying to edge toward selling out. In any case he's a great storyteller, simple musician with a oh-so-unique voice (Sort of Dylan, kinda Jack Johnson... well, how can I compare. I can't)What should you do? Buy Birds Flying Away. Give it a whirl. I guarantee you'll like it, or I'll buy it from you. Well, I suppose not; one copy is fine, but that's how much I liked it.Cheers!"
1,No you're shmoopy,"Very disappointing album. Not particularly interesting, too slick, and characterless heart-on-my sleeve lyrics. They sound like high school love songs. More than a little too ""earnest"". No subtleties here. At all. His first album has a rawness that this one lacks...instead of becoming more interesting, he became less interesting."
4,Love Tom & Jerry!,"I discovered that my friend at work is a Tom & Jerry afficiando. So I thought, ""Something Tom & Jerry related would make a unique Christmas gift!"" I searched Amazon and came across this set of Tom & Jerry scene collectibles and immediately order it. The package arrived in more than enough time for Christmas. I thoguht the item was a little pricey for what you get, but my friend was completely surprised with the gift and thinks it's awesome!"
3,lack of excitement,"While I liked the book overall, I thought there was a real lack of excitement in the battle scenes simply because the Slammers armored battalions simply walk right over their enemies with almost no casualties to themselves. Virtually every battle is the same: the tanks and armored cars go in, blow everything away in their path with little to no losses of their own, then the enemy surrenders. It would have been much more exciting if the Slammers faced an actual challenge from enemies that fired back, instead of the target practice/ turkey shoot battles that pervade the novel."
2,Font,"As a senior I have difficulty reading small print and therefore ordered the above item. But I find it also difficult to read because, though the print is larger than usual, the lines are too close to each other, with very little space in between. There is not enough white space on the pages. I'm afraid I won't be using this bible very much, if at all."
5,Absolutely Awesome!,"Great bible, large letters, love the leather cover and a great price! Definitiely worth every penny! Thanks you so much"
5,EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR,THIS IS AN EASY TO READ BIBLE AND MY FIRST CHOICE ESPECIALLY IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS WHEN IT IS HARD FOR ME TO FOCUS!!! I RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY.
5,I LOVE MY BIBLE!!!,"The print size is prefect, the words are easy to follow and I highly reccomend this. The bible is pretty durable"
3,Guetta's Pop Life not as good as the Guetta Blaster,"Guetta's second album Pop Life falls short of the first album. This pop house/electronic album is more on the lines of Ministry of Sound/Dance. I take it Guetta is trying to blast out in the pop life culture of commercial DJ fame with lead vocal singer Chris Willis. However, his lead single ""LOve is gone"" is no where close to the vocals or charisma of JD Davis who did ""The World is Mine"", ""In Love with Yourself"" on Guetta Blaster giving true electronic fans and house fans a taste of what Dave Gahan and House music put together could be like. I admit Guetta is still a top 5 DJ globally speaking with putting out a roster of talent lead vocals. There is no doubt that French House music is on top of its game, however Guetta needs to go back to the sound of his first album."
3,just average,"not much new with this release. Just a couple of half decent tunes, but you've heard it them all before.It's also a joke that you have to buy the entire album (instead of individual songs)."
5,POP LIFE,"I'm a big fan of his music, and I would have to say that I normally don't buy cds, but this is the ones I just had to purchase. Its rare for me to find a CD that I can listen to the whole thing and like ever song in it. The way that he sets up his songs flow from song to song. If you like this kind of genre then you should enjoy this cd."
5,A Ray Squeezed Through by Devrie Paradowski,"I bought the book and I highly recommend it to anyone. I just love it. I keep it on my desk at all times. The author has written poetry that is gritty, honest and touching. ""Childhood in Mondex"" is riveting and earthy. You can feel it, smell it- live it with her. The last poem ""For You Dad"" is very honest and touching. She didn't sugar coat her feelings because of the loss of her father (suddenly making him a Saint)... yet- the love was there, the mourning, the aftermath..""Every word you said, burrowed deep in my blood"".. Oustanding stuff..."
3,Good for Ophthalmic Optics,"This book has good content, particularly for ophthalmic optics. The description of optical aberrations is useful. However, the treatment of paraxial optics is confusing. The authors should avoid the use of symbols that are not writeable (e.g. Cyrillic), and obscure Greek letters. All in all, a useful book."
4,Fun book.,"I found a copy of this in a furniture store where I was working, about 10 years ago, and enjoyed it thoroughly. I've since bought it for a couple of other people and they've enjoyed it as well. It's not a classic, but it is an enjoyable tale"
1,BiAs!!,i had to do a research report on eyebrow piercing and this was the only bo0k the library had! all i have to say was that this bo0k was extremely bias saying all the untruths about piercings...Like the only people that get piercings are bikers and it is not excepted!! This bo0k really didnt even help Me!!
3,The Mississippi Chinese,Quite interesting. I did not know anything about Chinese Connection in Mississippi. This book is a revelation!
5,Zoom Video and Photographic arts,"Thios is the most worthwhile duplicator for it's price. Its fast efficient, and automated or manual.it does not even require a computer.i love it and i have made more than 500 copies in one month.[...] ."
4,legolas toy,"Legolas is a fun toy, i've got to say. I myself have a collection of LOTR figures, and Legolas is one of them. He is a good figure, his bow fires, and he has dagger slashing action. I recommend this toy to anyone who loves to play with or collect LOTR figures. Legolas is good for both."
5,I love Legolas,Legolas is the best character in the movie!( In my mind anyway)He was the only one to kill all those orcs/uri-kai with only recieving a smuge mark on his chin and forehead. when Aragorn Was cut and grose everywhere.(yuck) I love this toy because it looks just like him!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Legolas' figure is great!,Legolas' bow of the galadrhim actually fires the arrows he comes with! The two elven blades he can slash with. His face looks very determined and theis is a must have for all lotr collectorss
1,Excellent.,"Legolas was the first LoTR character I bought. Only three complaints. His left arm doesn't go down, it just sticks out to the side. And his right arm won't hold an arrown to his bow. I think the reason why is because my Legolas must have been one of the first versions of him made (I got him before the movie was released). So he doesn't really do much, except hold an arrowless bowas if he were going to fire an arrow with it. The paint job is exquisite work, and very ""elven"". However, his ears are not elf pointy. His ears are hobbit pointy. I wasn't too happy about his ears. But overall, it's a great figure for a setup or display (which is the way I have all my LoTR characters), but not at all very playable. Just for looks. And again, this is one of the first versions of him. I don't know about the newer versions of him."
5,Legolas is the BEST!!!!!!!1,"Legolas is the best because it really shoots the arrows. It slashes the daggers. I was always bored with my other action figures, until I got the Legolas figure. I highly recommend it for the people who like Legolas. It really keeps you entertained and it is also a collectors item. If I were you I would get it befor its gone in every store."
1,What is this?,"At the time I reviewed this, Amazon has not even listed the name of the books or any information about them, except to say that it's a set of books. The photograph is apparently of a box with no writing on it. Why would anyone buy this? Tell us what it is."
2,"Like X, don't like much of this album",This instrumental album confirmed why I like X so much: Exene and John Doe's amazing singing. The only song I will ever listen to again is Ramonetures' version of Adult Books.
1,SUCKS,DMX IS MY DAWG ARF ARF .... BUT DIS CD AINT GOOD AT ALL I HAVE ALL HIS CDS EXCEPT THIS ONE BECAUSE I REALLY DIDENT LIKE IT
3,It's cool,It's a cool CD an all but nothin to go crazy over. DMX and the others had some good ones on this CD but the rest need some real help.
2,You get what you pay for,"You get what you pay for. This battery definitely doesn't have the capacity of the standard LG battery, but it's good for a backup. It probably lasts 60-70% as long as a new original battery. Also, when it gets close to empty, it goes downhill quicker than the original battery. For the price it's not bad, but definitely not a replacement for the original."
1,Not worth the time,"All in all, I was pretty disappointed with You Can't Afford. Their writing felt very light and airy, lacking in substance. It didn't help that every other page was completely blank save a quotation.More troubling, there's a not-so-fine line between thinking positively and denying reality, and the authors here fall on the wrong side of it. Ironically, they acknowledge this line early in the book and pledge to heed it. Yet later in the book, for example, they encourage the reader to deal with painful memories by simply imagining how they would have liked things to go and dwelling on that. I found this invitation to denial insulting in more than one way.My final verdict: Don't bother with this one."
5,Clarity,"We all know what we want and we all know the things that we have to do to get what we want. Problem is that we get bogged down in negative routines and behaviours, fears and seeking approval from those around us.This book offers us very simple and very clear advice. It does this by highlighting our problems and shining enough light on them so that we are able to lose our inertia and act positively and directly.This book is a must for everyone. It's that simple."
4,Makes you think,I am about half way through this book and I really like it so far. I recommend it for anybody that may think they have an issue with negative thinking. It makes the reader think about things in a different perspective and I love the quotes too. Thanks
3,Buy a more up to date work.,"This book was great for its time. However as you can see from the publication date and the reviews, it was one of the first really popular one of its kind. Here we are in 2012 and there have been so many other works of this theme, much more up to date, with the latest science and the information, that this publication is nearly obsolete. If you must, it is a fun read. But do yourself a favor and look for much more recent books containg much better and up to date informaion."
1,you can't afford the luxury of a negative thought,"I purchased a new book, not used, the condition of the book I received looks as if the book has been stored in an attic of a garage, exposed to the outdoor elements for the last ten years. I had the luxury of many negative thoughts. I will think twice before ordering from amazon."
2,"Yay, another disappointment","This is a book of pleasantries for people who are easily influenced and can't think about what they're reading. ""Find the positive!"" it says. If your life is hell, look at the pretty shiny fire. The author makes points that range from valid but unhelpful to contradictory and moronic."
3,"FOCUS ON THE POSITIVE, WRITE DOWN THE POSITIVE",THINGS YOU DO FOR YOURSELF AND OTHERS. Also read; The anxiety and phobia workbook.
2,cheap looking and poor quality,"Item was suppose to be a gift but when we got it in the mail, and could get a better look at it realized it is poorly made."
5,WOW!!!,"katharine nailed both songs. even for my destiny which i didnt particularly like when she sang it on finale night. but the cd version....WOW!!! phantastic =D altho the lyric's kinda cheesy but i think its something that relates well to what she's been through during the her whole idol journey.OTR - didnt think she could sing it better, but she did. Job Well done Kat !!"
5,Loved it!!!!!,"I received my cd yesterday and after listening to it, I highly recommend it to everyone.Katherine's version of ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow"" was so beautiful it actually brought me to tears. She has a voice like an angel. It is a much better arrangement than the version she sang on AI.""My Destiny"" - although I felt the music was way too loud and drowned her out at times, she gave it her all and did an outstanding job. This cd is worth buying for ""Somewhere over the Rainbow"" alone!!!!I look forward to Katherine's album when it is released. She is a beautiful girl with a beautiful voice. I wish her much success!!!!"
1,Beautiful voice!!!,She is all about the voice. I can't believe how gorgeous it could be. Its like silk velvet or any other comparison. I can't think of any others right now. She sounds kind of like a light Norah Jones.
1,disappointed,"While I think Katharine has star potential and God given talent, this single seriously disappoints. If you are looking for that magical vocal sensation offered to us during many of her performances, you wont find it here. I found Destiny worse than when she sang it on the finale- and I really thought they would have dressed up the song in the studio. They didn't. SOTR is standard fair. If you loved it on AI, just rewatch your TIVO-better sound quality on TV. If her single is a prelude to her album, McPhee might be headed for the McBargain bin soon."
2,UNBELIEVABLE,"Unbelievably bad, that is. Not that I expected much more. I have always felt that Katherine McPhee was highly over-rated. But this single really proves me right. Seriously, I think I was being nice giving her 2 stars. Half the time, you can't even hear her, and when you can her voice is mediocre at best. She offers nothing new to OTR, and My Destiny is way below average. She is nowhere near as good as most of the female artists who currently top the charts today, for that matter, she is nowhere near as good as some of the female artists to come from the show(aka: Kelly; Carrie; Fantasia) For those of you who say she is very pretty, SO WHAT?! The way one looks mhas nothing to do with the way one sings. I know that I am offending some people with these comments, but sorry. That is how it is."
1,Its just Ok Sorry,Her cd single is just ok because on the song MY destiny its too low and she still cant sing it right it sounds like shes afraid to sing it. [...]
2,NOT WORTH YOUR TIME,Katharine Mcphee has a good voice. The problem on this cd is the songs are bland and you don't get to get the real Katharine Mcfee. Unlike Taylor Hicks her single My Destiny does nothing for me. Nor does somewhere over the rainbow. Save your money for other things.
5,BEST EVER,"this single is great!! Katharine's voice is even more incredible!if you didn't like My Destiny before, you will certainly like now!! her voice, the melody, everything is so great.Somewhere Over The Rainbow, i don't know how, is more perfect than it already was! i thought it was impossible, but here kath goes again, surprising.Amazing single!"
5,WoW,I'm really surprised to hear Kat's single to be better than Taylor's on its studio version.My Destiny turned out to be a really good song.SOTR is just phenomenal!!!KAT is a TRUE TALENT!
1,NOT WORTH YOUR TIME,I hate to give this single a bad rating because I like Katharine Mcphee. The problem is in the songs and not being able to hear her voice clear. My Destiny is just a bad song. There's nothing because of the over production that Katharine Mcphee can do. Her voice is solid but not strong and you don't get a chance to hear her voice. The music is too loud. It's not a song that Kathraine can save. so sorry. Some where over the rainbow is flat. The song is missing something that made it great when other artists did it. Save your money. this is not worth your time. She will have a cd comming out this year maybe it will be better.
2,Not good enough.,"The problem with Katharine is her inability to communicate in the proper manner with the lyrics. They are much more inspiring than her voice can touch. I just don't think it was wise to tackle such a classic. They should've went for something a little less intense. My Destiny is okay, for a teenage prom, but I don't see it going anywhere."
5,Over the Rainbow is over the top,This is the most beautiful and expressive version of the classic song I've ever heard. I'm so glad it was produced on CD after it aired on American Idol!
5,Katharine Mcphee rocks!,"she has such a great voice..i have been watching american idol since it started and i saw her she was just great..i just knew she was going to be a finalist..she should of won..SHE HAD THE REAL VOICE AND she was the real thing...this single sounds very professional and i can listen to her and never get sick of her..shes that great...i love the song ""my destiny""..she raises her voice so gently..over the rainbow is a soft and gentle song..she sounds like an angel..i love her..look at her cd coming soon...buy it !! she is wonderful and listenable."
2,I didn't like it,She doesn't sing very good because her voice is pitchy when she sings high and loud. She shouldn't smile when she sings sad songs. Some of my friends like her voice but most don't. It doesn't cost very much to buy this album though so go ahead.
3,A Beautiful Yet Plastic Voice,"No doubt Katharine has a gift - a very beautiful voice that shines when in her element. Yet however technically amazing she is, I have to say she lacks artistry, passion, depth. She sings the song straight out of the book without any interpretation. This is particularily evident on My Destiny, an overproduced, mechanical piece of tripe more of a ""product"" than ""music"". Yes, she didn't pick the song, but someone with artistry could add their own twist to solidify it as their song.I'm not going to give her a one, because her voice itself is very beautiful in technical aspects. But it lacks something else, it lacks what is the true essence of music, the core - interpretation, emotion, depth, artistry.3 is my score for her.(3.5 for SOTR)(2 for My Destiny)"
4,"LOVE Rainbow, HATE My Destiny","Kat can sing Over the Rainbow like nobody's business. It's just beautiful. However, My Destiny is the most cloying, ridiculous song I've ever suffered through. Here's hoping she feels the same way and will choose her future music accordingly."
5,Wow. She's great :-),"Katharine has an outstanding voice. I love these songs. She's made me like Somewhere Over The Rainbow. I used to hate it because it's been sung so many times before and it's overdone, but Katharine has made it her own and with her beautiful and powerful voice, it's shed new light on this old song for me. I still don't know whether she or Taylor should have won - they are both great - but with songs like these and the many more she's going to do, she's going to be as big as Kelly. This is one very talented girl who can sing so well. My Destiny is a great song and you won't be disappointed if you make this purchase. It's outstanding."
5,SOTR & My Destiny ... Superb!!!,I am SO proud of what Katharine has done with her first double A side single! It's much more than I expected after how they were done on the show. Katharine is a star in the making and I'm so glad to have been witness to her debut. I can't wait ... For Katharine's upcoming album to be released! Go Kat Go!!!
3,ANOTHER AMERICAN IDOL DULL SONG,"Katharine Mcphee does the best with what she is given. My destiny is a bland song. It's not terrible I just wouldn't buy it. Some where over the rainbow is not my cup of tea. Wait till her cd comes out, maybe there will be better songs. This is not the one"
5,Katharine McPhee - our next Superstar,"Buy this CD today - Katharine McPhee is going to be a huge star and it will be a valuable collector's item. ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" is and will forever be the signature performance from American Idol Season 5 and the CD version is even better. I have not heard a more pure and clean voice in a long time. The recorded version of ""My Destiny"" is also particularly moving after knowing her story. It's so much better on the CD than it was on the show.If it wasn't a boy's turn to win American Idol this year, Katharine would have ran away with the Title hands down. But - who cares now? After listening to her recording voice, it's no wonder Simon thought she had the best voice in the competition and that David Foster and Andrea Bocelli are huge fans. I can't wait to hear her full CD. She's amazing"
5,An Idol Single That's Actually Good?!,"I've followed American Idol since its first season, but I had never even contemplated purchasing any of the singles before this year. The coronoation songs forced onto the poor contestants are consistently atrocious. But when I saw that Katharine was recording her version of ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow,"" the best performance I've seen on American Idol, I decided it was worth the purchase, despite the lackluster ""My Destiny.""Both songs ended up surpassing my expectations. I was surprised that ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" was actually able to recapture the magic of the live performance; and ""My Destiny,"" while still the typical cliche-ridden, over-produced Idol song, is elevated by Katharine's voice and I have to begrudgingly admit that it has even started to grow on me."
4,Great,I t hink that the only thing that this singles lacks is a dance song. i think kathrene should branch out and start doing club stuff. maybe that will come on her album and remixes.so if you watch American Idol this bacicly the same really as it is on the show.i think Kat shold have won because she just might be the next Kelly Clarkson.
1,McBad,"I have to say, this is really not very good material. It's pretty darn bad. She shouldn't bother with singing this bad kind of material. It's just so lackluster that it doesn't work to her benefit even."
1,"""just a step beyond the rainbow...""","I love this single! The lyrics are so beautiful. wow :) It's amazing, the best purchase I ever bought."
1,My Destiny makes it all worth it.,"I really don't like SOmewhere Over The Rainbow, but I love My Destiny. It's a great single!"
1,i don't get it,i don't get how she made runner up on AI--there was much better talent on there. I thought i would give this a try but am greatly disappointed in the two singles. I don't see either getting much radio play--i'm sorry not seeing the appeal here-not trying to be mean but she isn't producing a winner with this one--maybe the next one will do better.
2,Very cheesy song.,I find the song pretty cheesy. I mean she could've at least sung it a little better than this. It's just not that impressive. I think you should buy Taylor's instead. His is AMAAZINGG.
2,My Honest Review...,"1. Somewhere Over The Rainbow - Can't stand the arrangement. However, I am fascinated with her vocals. One note she hits is chilling. I don't think it holds a candle to the original though. 4/52. My Destiny - A pretty bad song. The lyrics are predictable, and the production seems so generic and boring. Her voice sounds pretty computer generated on the high points of the song. 1/5Overall - 2/5Katharine McPhee has a gorgeous voice, but overall, it isn't unique nor memorable. I think unless she finds her own style that she's going to run into problems."
5,now that's gorgeous!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! need I say more!!!!!!!!! misty
4,my favourite idol this past year.....,"kathrine mcphee argubally was the best singer this past season. she had range, depth, and control of her voice. she was one of the few idols that was classically trained to sing.... i felt kind of bad that she did not win this year... taylor is a good entertainer but a microwaved michael mcdonald (but that is another story).this single includes quite possibly the ebst performance on her stay on idol. ""somewhere over the rainbow"" was by far one of the best performances since fantasia's winning performance of 'i believe'. very good rendition of this song....im not to fond of 'my destiny', but she did do very well on this track as well...overall i thought she should have won idol and this single proves that she should have instead of the other guy....3.9 stars out of 5"
5,What a voice!,"I can't remember the last time I got chills just from the sound of someones voice. This girl is simply amazing! I must say I'm not usually a fan of this type of music, but MY GAWD, I could listen to McPhee sing all day long. The future for her looks very, very bright."
5,"I ACTUALLY BOUGHT THE CD SINGLE, THANKS!",I never buy cd singles and cds anymore but I purchased this single tonight. I was very pleased when I heard Somewhere Over the Rainbow was put on the single because I didn't really think My Destiny was all that great on the show. Actually I thought it was retched. But the song sounds AMAZING on the single and I like it better now than SOTR. Definitely buy this cd!
5,Music Educator Speaks!!,"After teaching music for 22 years I'm very pleased to say that American Idol has topped it's list of stardom!! There have been many brilliant musicians that have passed through the Idol doors in recent years, but Ms. McPhee has proven to be the most shining star the show has produced, thus far. She is so poised on stage and her vocal ability is exquisite. She has been nearly pitch perfect all Season and her musical expression is engaging. Bravo to Ms.McPhee on her debut album and I'm looking forward to more of her work."
5,Excellent!!!!,"Love her rendition of ""Somewhere over the rainbow."" Even though it may be different from Judy Garland, but she made it her own. Great job Katharine. Keep it up girl!!!!"
5,BREATHTAKINGLY....,"BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL!! The Cd is magnificant don't let the negative comments sway you..listen for yourself. It would only take a moment and a quick visit to any Message Board concerning American Idol to realize that these negative comments are from discontented fans of other Idols. Don't deprive yourself of Katharine's magic!! It made my daughter cry, it's that beautiful!!"
1,COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,"Katharine mcphees first single is a disapointment. My destiny is a small fish in a big pond. In other words the song just doesn't make it. It is a ok song that does not get the listeners attention. It's a song that if on the radio you might change the station, because of bordom. Katharine Mcphee has a good voice that you don't get to fully hear because of the way the song is arranged. Some Where over The Rainbow has been done too many times.Good singer fair songs. Wait for her full cd to come out"
5,WOW,I love this CD...Katharine McPhee has a stunning voice and powerful emotion that make SOTR and My Destiny more than just a song but a testimony to her personal journey.
2,"It's Okay, but it's not ""Great""!","I cannot give this the 5 star review that Katharine fans have given it. Although ""Over the Rainbow"" is quite well done and shows off a very pretty voice, it lacks the ""Wow"" factor that more polished performers have given it, and ""My Destiny"" is not that great a song in the first place, but Ms McPhee just didn't make it work.Hopefully the full length album will be better received."
5,Real Talent,"A pure voice like I've never heard. In ""My Destiny"" she sounds great but the song is average, we should blame the songwriters. The magic is definitely in ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow"". I can see a bright future for her. We are in the presence of true talent."
4,Nice debut for Katharine.,"""Somewhere Over The Rainbow"" 8/10. Her live performances of this song were better, but she still did a good job. This is one of my favorite songs of all time and she always does a great job singing it.""My Destiny"" 9/10 It's so much better than her performance at the finale. I wish she would've sang it this way on that night. It may not be the greatest song, but she did an excellent job with it.I really believe that she has a bright future ahead of her."
3,Shameful,"I have not bought Katherine's cd yet, but I am sure she does an awesome job. She has a strong beautiful voice and I wish her the best of luck. My favorite it Taylor Hicks, but I won't lower myself to come on here and write a bad review about Katherine. If Somewhere Over the Rainbow is half as good as it was on AI I am sure it phenominal. It is shameful to read some of the reviews Katherine's fans have put on Taylor's CD and I think she would be ashamed to have those people as her fanbase. Good luck to both Taylor and Katherine!!!"
1,Average at best.,"Its deserving of 2 stars. 2.5 to be exact. If I was just judging vocals she'd have 5 stars, but its not just about that. You have to factor in everything else(such as uniqueness and quality/tone not copying the original).. she gets a 0/5 for those. So really she deserves 2 stars."
1,Not my cup of tea,"Being an American Idol fan, and with SOTR being one of my favorite songs of all time - I bought this CD from Walmart earlier today. I was greatly disappointed. My Destiny is just a weak song - no fault of Ms McPhee, but that song simply should not have made the cut to be recorded! As for SOTR, she made a commendable attempt, but still fell far short of other versions I've heard, particularly the original by Judy Garland. Am glad this is only a single and I didn't have to pay that much for it."
3,Decent Version,"Not my favorite song, not the best rendition. Shane Ward did a more spectacular version. However, this one was still very nice. Vocals are smooth and easy on the ears for the most part. Good job!"
4,A Star is Rising in the West,"If you want a reason to buy this CD, here it is: Although the entertainment industry is unpredictable, Katharine McPhee is a rare musical talent, likely to become a star of studio, concert hall, and stage. This CD gets you in on the ground floor; be able to say, I was one of her fans right from the start.Almost nothing's perfect and one can take issue with certain elements of the CD. But Katharine's vocal clarity, precise phrasing, and growing emotional understanding of music makes this recording a winner. Both songs are beautifully performed. And she is only at the beginning of her developing powers. Invest in the potential."
5,McPhabulous,"When Kat performed ""My Destiny"" on Idol, I wasn't thrilled with it, but it's great here. I really like the song. In fact, I think it's better than ""Over the Rainbow."" OTR is well done as well.I can't wait for Kat's album to come out. I think she has a long successful career ahead of her."
3,Wish I had waited for the full-length album,Somewhere over the rainbow is better than my destiny. I expected more from a studio quality production. A little pitchy in my destiny. Hope for better on the full-length album!!!
2,"Great voice, but unimpressive songs...","Ms. McPhee has a great voice and talent, but ""My Destiny"" is in one word - awful, and is (in my book) the worst original song ""Idol"" has ever released as a single. The second song ""Over the Rainbow"" may be a great song choice, but the arrangement (starting with the little-heard verse) does not excite me.I have a terrible feeling that this talented young lady may be headed in the same path as Justin Guarini and Diana DeGarmo - runner-ups whose debut albums were poor sellers. However, I see a great future for her nonetheless."
1,Lacking anything special.,"I think the producers are at fault here. It isn't exactly McPhee who runs dry at the lyrics, its more the lyrics themselves. Written by Nick Lachey and Tamyra Gray doesn't help either. Their cheesy singles Inside Your Heaven and I Believe were bad enough to cut off anybodys lyrical artistry. But really, she doesn't have much to contribute to the musical edge. I wouldn't reccommend this."
1,Really the best I've heard in ages..,Katharines voice has to be one of the best voices ever! Its crystal clear and beautiful. I hope shes around for a long while.#1!!
1,didn't need to get as far as she did on American Idol,"How'd this chick swing second place when Chris Daughtry, who ought to have won hands down, got fourth? It ain't right. She can sing and she's sure nice for the eyes, but I really hate the music she's chosen to perform. I found her rendition of ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow"" drastically overrated; it wasn't even that great. I loathe that song, I don't know why she would try to bring it back to life over five decades after it was written. The lyrics are really cheesy, I found it painful to listen back to in ""The Wizard of Oz"", but in modern times it's even more of a disaster. The song ought not to have been famous; songs today have to have a beat or a bit of pizzazz to'em; soft stuff can have its moments but at least not on this CD. This review of course will be disagreed"
5,Outstanding Singer-Outstanding Production!,"I have been involved in the Performing Arts for over 40 years. (I am currently in rehearsal for a production of West Side Story) During that time I have heard and encountered countless singers: Operatic, Pop, Jazz, Broadway, you name it. Some good, some bad, some destined for Legendary Stardom because of their ability.Katharine McPhee is in that final category. When I draw comparisons, the names Streisand, Houston and Dion come to mind. Then I think about the fact that she is only 22. As her career progresses, it boggles my ming to think of the level of artistry she has the potential to reach, across performance genres.Combine that with the outstanding production on this recording, it's a sure hit! It will probably become a collector's item.BUY IT!!"
5,Wonderfully done,Katherine did a wonderful job on both songs. just when you thought she couldnt do any better she did. over the rainbow was magnificiently done - showcasing her trademark voice. my destiny too was fantastic - a lot better than when she first sang it.Expect great things from Ms McPhee...
5,One of the best pop ballads I've heard,"I don't care what anyone else says, I LOVE ""My Destiny"" and it's one of the best pop songs I've ever heard and Katharine in the song comes off as being very graceful and romantic, it's definitely on my list as one of my favorites. The studio version of ""My Destiny"" is amazing go buy her debut single! and support Katharine. I can't wait until her album comes out soon just to watch her shine."
5,Fabulous!!!,"Katharine has an amazing voice. These two tracks sound absolutley incredible. ""My Destiny"" doesn't get the credit it deserves. She makes the song a hit. ""Over the Rainbow"" rates right up there with Judy Garland and Eva Cassidys versions. AMAZING!"
5,"My Destiny"" / ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow","This single is great. [...]Please don't hesitate to purchase this cheap single. SOTR is amazing. It's been redone with the help of master producer David Foster, and Katharine Mcphee has done Judy Garland JUSTICE. MY destiny is also an amazing track. Perfect for any celebration. Give this girl a chance [...]! --OH...get the CD too. It's worth EVERY penny."
5,Totally beautiful!,I had always thought that no one could sing Over the Rainbow as well as Judy Garland. I was wrong! Katharine McPhee's version is wonderful. I could listen to it over and over! A terrific song and a fantastic songstress!
5,A good listen,"[...]This cd is great. I wasn't expecting too much out of an AI single, but Katharine's rendition of ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow"" is a pleasant listen. My Destiny sounds better than when performed on Idol, but it's still way too overproduced. I'm glad these aren't the people Katharine will be working with on her album."
5,Katherine McPhee 'My Destiny/Somewhere Over The Rainbow',"Katherine has a beautiful voice. Both tracks are as good as each other, I can't decide which track is the best out of the two though. Even though I like Taylor Hicks, Katherine should of won American Idol 2006 in my opinion. I can't wait for her to release her first album. I purchased this from Amazon USA as it has not been released here in the UK."
2,"Pretty Girl, OK voice","Nice vocal, sounds like a hundred other nice vocals, nothing special. Would rather listen to Judy Garland's rendition of OTR.....My Destiny.......OK. Doubt that I would buy her album when it comes out......nothing unique about her voice, nice voice but sounds like too many other nice voices."
3,"It's not a 5 or a 1, but something in between","Katharine deserved a better debut single than My Destiny, but it's blatantly unfair to say she can't sing. ...The particular style of these songs may not be the most appealing, but I think there will be something better from Kat on the horizon.Take the over the top reviews (from both ends of the spectrum) with a grain of salt.Give the young lady a chance!!!!!!!!!"
4,Very nice.,"I see bad people posting here.This single is not perfect, I agree, My Destiny's ending is very weird. But I really liked it.Let me guess... 90% of people who are writing bad reviews here are Chris or Elliott's fans. Bad losers, sry."
4,Really enjoyable Regina tracks,"I really wanted a CD that featured a Regina music box and I had to do a lot of digging to find this one. It was worth it though because every track is of a Regina playing! The songs are really beautiful, and my favorite is O Sanctissima. I gave the CD four stars because there were some other religious (non-Christmas-y) songs that I wasn't as interested in. I would have loved to hear some other Christmas favorites played by the Regina, but those discs may not exist.Not sure why they called it ""Baby's First Christmas"" because anyone of any age who loves Regina music boxes would love this CD!"
1,Gordon-Reed's unprofessional omission of Randolph Jefferson.,"As the author of ""The English Ancestry of Thomas Jefferson"" (pub. 1996), I found it highly unprofessional that Gordon-Reed in her book omitted Randolph Jefferson, younger brother of Thomas Jefferson, who had the same DNA as Thomas, was often at ""Monticello"", and was a possible father of Eston Hemings. I must think that Randolph clouded the issue for Gordon-Reed so she ignored him."
4,Lost Comments of William Cullen Bryant - 1808,"In an 1808 pamphlet entitled ""The Embargo"", 13 year old William Cullen Bryant who would be known for poetry such as 'Thanatopsis' apparently voiced the common thought of the day in Boston when he wrote in an attack on Mr. Jefferson's policies of the time that Jefferson should ""Go, scan, Philosophist, thy Sally's charms, And sink supinely in her sable arms; But quit to abler hands the helm of state.""If a 13 year old budding American poet in New England could advise Jefferson on matters of his personal life, then this Hemings-Jefferson relationship must, indeed, have been very common knowledge in 1808."
1,"Prosecution 1, Defense 0","sloppy research...this lawyer presents ONLY the information which will support her case, rather than an unbiased review of the FACTS (one learns this technique in Lawyer Class 101) i would like to hear the response from the defense...the prosecution has presented its case, and unfortunately, there are millions who are convinced without hearing the other side...this author knew what she wanted the result to be, and proceeded to assassinate the character of President Thomas Jefferson...i will not speculate as to her motivation...do not let this book, or any other book by mz Reed be the only information you depend on for your opinion..."
3,jefferson and sally,this book discusses a lot of history and gives the world a very different view of thomas jefferson. if you are interested in him as a person and as a historical personage this is a good one to read.
5,Historic,"Important for any Blues collector. This album joins Jimmy Reed, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf and BB King and more in mine."
5,Wonderful....A must have!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I purchased these dvd's for my 2 year old never expecting she would learn so fast. She really enjoys watching them and now uses sign language while she is communicating with us completely on her own. I have enjoyed learning as well and would highly recomend these for anyone wanting to learn sign language. Now we can't wait to get vol. 4-6.
5,Ultimate Christmas Morning Music,"This set is by far the absolute best collection of Christmas music ever put together! Our family doesn't even think to start our Christmas morning festivities without 'popping' in this cassette (now buy CD's!). We even listen to this collection while we wrap Christmas gifts! We are a Christmas ""fanatic"" family and have literally hundreds of Christmas records, tapes and CD's but this collecton is the only one that can add to the warmth of this special season and I know it has become a family tradition that will bring cherished memories to our children when they have families of their own. You can't lose with this set!"
4,Inspirational!,"This is a great book if you're looking for ideas or wondering how to handle a particular subject. It's divided into sections by subject matter, such as Still Life, Birds, Animals and The Human World. One page (for example) shows 3 elephant mosaics done by different artists, and explains how different techniques and styles produce a completely different end result.The author's work predominates but there are a substantial number of other artists too. At the end of the book is a directory of the artists and their contact details. They're predominantly British, although there are a few Americans too.What this book *doesn't* have is DIY projects and in-depth explanations of techniques/tools/materials.If you buy it for the right reason - inspiration rather than instruction - you should be very happy with it!"
4,Elvira on DVD,"This was the first time I had seen Elvira besides the movie. While this is no MST3K, her jokes can be somewhat funny, but it is nice to have these movies that aren't normally available on dvd. The movies can be watched with or without Elvira which is also another nice added touch."
5,Could Not Put It Down - Great!!!,"I fell in love with Caleb and Serenity. The chemistry between the two characters was amazing. At the end of the book the dialogue between Caleb, Roland and Blade was hysterical. Sure the story may have been fetched at times and the characters were an unlikely pair, still I found it very entertaining and a light read. The other two books I read by this author paled in comparison. So glad I gave this book a try."
5,Not just a great read - a great re-read!,"Yes, I have read this book several times. It is just as good the fourth time as the first. If you like your books with strong male and female characters, you will like Jayne Krentz. Serenity is not like many female characters I have read, she is gentle but strong, caring and loyal. I love her uniqueness and her 'alternative' lifestyle. Caleb is a man who never really knew if he was loved and does not really believe it exists. The two meet amidst a murder mystery which they try to solve as well as putting their own lives back together. What a great couple. And I loved the secondary characters! I think you will too."
5,It was all a dream,Well when i bought this cd i said it better jam and this cd jams. So if you live in H-town like i do get yourself a good car jam out to this cd and go down richmond ave.
5,Wonderful children's book about respect for the animals!,My children and I loved this book. I showed this book to many of my family and friends and they also enjoyed it. This book is well written and the colorful illustrations by Patti Kern are awesome. Well done job by Mr. Luksetich and Ms. Patti Kern!... I can't wait to see more brilliant illustrations in the next book.
2,Negative to Say the Least,"I sort of brushed off other reader's reports of this book being too negative towards living in Oahu and thought I would give it a read anyway. So many readers can't be wrong and they weren't. The author spends most of their time complaining how the high cost of living in Hawaii, how hard it is to find a job outside of tourism, etc. It makes me wonder if they have ever lived in a big city such as New York or LA where the price of living is obnoxious. The book should be titled, ""So You Want to Live in Hawaii After Living in the Cheap Section of the Mainland."" Worth a stop to the library, but don't waste your $20."
3,Some good information on moving to Hawaii,"There doesn't seem to be all that much published in hard copy on this subject so it was good to find this guide. It contains some very good information. However I already knew about a lot of what is in the guide from hunting around on the Internet and if you are reading this review chances are that you too can find most of what is in this guide out there on the rest of the Internet too. I think the book does not provide quite enough information or enough depth of information to rate say, four or five stars. Still, for the money it is not a bad addition to your Hawaii research bookshelf."
1,Negative view,"Quite a negative view of Hawaii. Just remember that this is just one persons view of Hawaii and this author did not seem to assimilate well. Any person who travels is able to find the downside to any city. She quotes from her book that someone said about not asking about the type of job but whether one is employed or not, seems condescending and incorrect as Hawaii has one on the lowest umemployment rates in the country. Pass unless you want a pessimistic read."
3,Disappointing and depressing,"I have never been to Hawaii and am about to take my first vacation there. This book almost makes me not want to go. I don't see the aloha. I see resentment, hatred and animosity towards ""non locals"", based on the stories in the book. I am African American and was extremely disheartened to read what she said about prejudice towards this group. I have a young, blond haired very white stepson and I feel I'd be doing him a disservice by moving to the islands. What I really want to know is, it it really true? Are the people really that hostile to newcomers? Or, do the authors go overboard. I would have to agree with the writer who said that this book must have a secret agenda of trying to persuade people to NOT move to Hawaii. I almost wish I hadn't read it."
5,Another good book before moving to Hawaii,"Any material that you can read before moving here, will help you ! We have been here 2 years now and even though the book was outdated in some areas, the information helps."
3,It's missing a few things and dated now but still ......,"We bought this book about 2 months before we moved to Oahu in July of 2002. It gave us info on some things like the 3 inch flying cockroaches, and the information about crime statistics (yes car theft is high, and yes our Jeep Cherokee was stolen within 6 months of moving here so I guess that was accurate). But many of the things in this book I had already come across on other sites and through other sources (but then again I did a lot of research before our move).The book is a few years old now and some things seem to need updated, that might be part of the problem. Food costs are similar to those listed in the book but information on housing is very misleading as the prices have skyrocketed.I still recommend it to anyone considering moving here because it is so far the only book I've seen with a fair amount of information on the negative side of living here. I do enjoy living here but it's not all paradise."
2,Too focused on the caucasian reader,"Like many other reviewers, I've been considering moving to Hawaii. Like many other reviewers, I feel that it's a little too negative and moreover, I do not think it is even suitable for myself. There are many stories in there talking about haole moving there being unwelcomed. I didn't know what haole meant but from the stories it seemed to imply that it's a term for caucasians from mainland. (that's indeed the case, looking it up on wikipedia) I'm of Asian descent and grew up in California, and I don't feel like I am getting useful information out of this book at all regarding how locals would view me. There are some useful practical information in there, but there are probably better books for those also."
2,A good book for haoles,"Having lived my whole life on the mainland, I was interested in a move to Hawaii. I found Toni's book and hoped that it would help me with the logistics of a move. Although there are some good tips on moving there, I found her chief audience to be haoles (whites). Instead of encouraging an assimiliation into the culture and appreciation for the people, there were cautionary notes as to how 'they' were different. I found most of the book quite superficial. Only a few chapters at the end about the actual logistics of moving and finding a job were of any help."
2,"Disappointed - Meant for Principals and Above, Not Parents","While this is probably a very good book for any school administrators in a position of power, it really does not offer much in terms of realistic, valuable advice for parents. As the incoming PTA President at my children's elementary school next year, I was looking more at what parents can be doing to foster relationships and run a successful PTA.The recommendations given in this book are focused at the administrative level and must really be implemented by those in authority, as I am the last one who can be telling my Principal that she needs to completely overhaul our entire system. For those whose principals are receptive to that, more power to you. For those whose principals are not, I suggest you look elsewhere for helpful advice. This goes well beyond the Bake Sale and really has nothing to do with the PTA unless you are an adminstrator looking to change things or your school's relationship with its parents."
3,Movie review,It was alright. I was expecting more (maybe more drama). The young girl that was followed in this documentary seems alot older for her age. She is mature in her speaking and analyzes the situation alot more than I would expect from someone her age.
4,Blind Justice-,"Strange movie, but good. as all spag. westerns go. Do not think I have seen anything like it before and I have seen alot of movies. But have watched it more than once. It gets to you."
1,Very disappointing,"I didn't find anything likable or entertaining about this movie. The characters were shallow, the story was ABCDE, and the end uses a silly deux-ex-machina. Much of what happens occurs for no good reason. We're never given the slightest reason to believe that anything that happens is credible. I came to this movie as a fan of the writer (from Carnivale), but was very disappointed that it had absolutely none of the subtlety, depth or interest of his work on Carnivale.Reading the other positive reviews makes me think it's possible my high expectations led to my disappointment, but I don't think so. This was just too simple, silly and loose for me."
4,This is definetly a good book.,"One thing I liked about this book is that it introduced me to many concepts in HTML and interactive webpages that I did not previously know. This book is easy to read, and easy to follow. This is a great book for intermediate web developers. This book really got me thinking about cool ideas to make my webpages more interactive and more exciting. This book does do a good job of providing explanations on coding for Netscape, as much as you can do that. I was dissapointed that many of the URL demos listed in the book are no longer working URL's. Some topics didn't go into as much detail as I would have liked. This book doesn't make a great reference book, but then I suppose it's not supposed to be. This is overall a great book, and I recommend it for anyone who wants to add more spice to their webpages"
2,good reading for bit advanced programmers,"the book conttains a lot of information useful for a bit advanced dhtml programming - but surely this is not the one for beginners.take the example of chapter 3 on css - it starts with how to show/hide style sheet and the compatibility issues between IE & NS , without explaining what a CSS actually is ..."
2,missing examples on web site,"the book comes with no companion cd-rom. one has to go to the web site for working examples of the code and to copy and paste rather than typing out code. however, several examples are no longer on the web site. the links to them are there but this is what i get from them: ""The website or webpage you were attempting to access does not exist on our servers..."" i'm quite upset about this and would give the book no stars, but since it's still a good intro to dhtml, i'll give it 2. i don't think it's worth buying until the site is fixed or a cd is included so one doesn't have to rely on the availability of the material on the web site."
5,Black Beauty,Jessica Gallo 7th gradePS/IS 87QBlack BeautyBy: Anna SewellMy book review of Black Beauty by Anna Sewell is happy and sad. It's happy because the horse named Black Beauty made friends and made his master smile.It's sad because there's a fire and two other horses die. In the book Beauty is the horse that was chosen to ride by the people in the story.I like this book because it's about horses. Also because it shows me what a horse's life is about. I really liked the book because of Beauty. Beauty is smart. When it was raining the bridge was broke and no one saw it but Beauty. Beauty stopped at the bridge until someone told them that the bridge was broken.I didn't like it because horses died in the story and Beauty loses freinds.I recommend this book to teens and adults. The books characters speak different because the setting takes place in Great Britain.
5,Best DHTML book of its time!!,"In all honestly, if you know nothing about web design, do not get this book. This book provideds an excellent foundation in DHTML/CSS for people who have HTML experience and want to move their programming to a higher level. While it does not teach JavaScript (a critical component of most DHTML programming), it does provide an excellent line-by-line breakdown of each example -- more than enough to understand the code.I have seen many DHTML books. None come close to this one for examples. It covers everything you need to know from simple DHTML, to using push technology. The supporting website has really grown over the last little while to include many excellent DHTML examples."
2,Dynamic Html,sir; i will be very glad to recieve information about dynamic Html. Eng.man rash. thank you
4,Bitter Apple for Dogs,"This product is a life saver when you have a puppy. We spray it on anything that we want our dog to leave alone. It especially works well on furniture. It does wear off, though, and we have to respray from time to time.Bitter Apple Taste Deterrent For Dogs 16 Oz Spray"
1,Worst CD Ever!!!!,"This is truly a horrific example of Death Row records. If you value your opinion of most of Suge's productions, do not buy this, since it will forever scar you emotionally and physically.PROS: Snoop Dogg, Nate Dogg. CD ArtistryCONS: Where's Snoop Dogg and Nate Dogg?All I have to say is ""What the hell???"""
1,call the bomb squad,"Somehow the spirit of Christmas and gangsta rap don't fit. There's a better hip-hop Christmas CD waiting to be made somewhere. Nothing against Suge and the gang at Death Row but this ain't da bomb, it just bombs."
1,It is a good thing every other death row cd is good.........,"To make a long story short, DEATH ROW USED TO BE THE BEST (doggystyle, chronic) BUT NOW HAS FALLEN APART(2pacs death, no-limit Snoop, Dre on a different label) This cd is a complete joke and I think SUGE SHOULD SERVE SOME JAIL TIME FOR THIS. Having gangsters rap about Christmas is just crazy. I do not like this cd and I dont see how anyone could. Just listen to the samples here and laugh."
3,It could be better,"The whole Rap Christmas CD idea is cool, but this is Death Row...Where's Snoop, Dre, and 2pac?"
5,sri aurobindo,"Yes I have been told this book, is very special, a kin to auto biography of a yogi, but unfortunatley after 5 weeks of waiting, I have still not recieved the book, please can you resend it so I can read, as I have paid for it thankyou Pauline"
3,Dubbed?,"This is finally coming out, but only dubbed in English? I hope the advance info is wrong about that. Otherwise, I can't wait to see a new print of this."
5,Wondefully well written,"This is a delightful new presentation of Process Algebra, which was much needed since the classic text by Baeten and Weijland is getting outdated. In comparison, I find Fokkink's text more easy to digest, more precise and going significantly further. Indeed, it should be for a theory that has evolved rapidly in the last decade. Process Algebra is on its way to become the tool to build full-proof software that will lead us out of the present day software jungle. I have used this text in my one semester class in Trier and can recommend it to any serious student of computer science."
3,Servicable but in dire need of revision,"This Loeb Classical Library edition of Juvenal and Persius was first published in 1918 and was last revised in 1940. The translations are servicable, but this particular volume badly needs the revision that other Loeb volumes have been receiving under the skilled hand of G.P. Goold, currently general editor of the series. The translations of the Juvenal satires in the current volume have been censored where Juvenal was evidently felt by the standards of 1918 to have been too indecent (cf. II.49-50 for an example; the Latin, however, is untouched). While one can understand the reticience of the editor given his era, this censorship should really be remedied in a future revision (as it has been in the Loeb ""Catullus"" edited by Goold). Until then Peter Green's fine translation for Penguin contains a complete rendering which will allow the reader to judge for himself or herself whether or not to be shocked by what Juvenal says."
3,"Nice songs, but iffy sound quality","Not sure what the problem is, but the songs on this CD don't sound very good. I know a lot of that is based on the nature of old songs, but there's something weird about the EQ. Tracks from Charles Brown and Johnny Adams are great, but there's a very disappointing version of the title track from Patti LaBelle. Basically, a few nice tracks at a bargain price."
5,A behind the scenes look at how TV shows are marketed,"I'm a student studying TV advertising and marketing and this book provided what my college texts and professors didn't: a real behind the scenes look at the inner workings of TV Promotion. It's funny, hip, cynical, smart and contemporary. I feel I have a better take on what this end of the business is about from people who've been there. I'd recommend it to anyone starting out who is considering a career in television. Well done!"
3,Those who can't ...write,Though an interesting topic...there is a reason why good promotion is short and sweet - perhaps they should have remembered this while writing this trivial book.
2,Waste of Paper,Sometimes writers need to learn that secrets are best kept to yourself. A waste of money.
4,Works great overall.,"Brush works great but the only part I wasn't 100% pleased with is that I received a bent wooden handle. The long wooden handle has a curve to it if you look down its length. Overall it doesn't affect its performance if you screw the handle in so the curve bends like a camels back down to the broom brush. If you have the curve to the left or the right when your pushing it bends more & is harder to push forward when pushing much sand or gravel away from the cement.The brush itself works great, some of the bristles fall out here and there but doesn't wear fast overall. If I didn't receive a bent handle I am sure I would have fully approved this product."
3,average,"broom is average, could be little cheaper for the perfomance but not too bad. dont try to sweep too much grass, but most garage stuff and basement stuff works fine"
5,"Riveting, inspirational & thought-provoking",I just loved this book! Not only did it keep me up late reading but at the end it really gave me some things to think about in my own Christian walk. Kathy Herman is one of my all time favorite authors and she never lets me down. This book is a perfect example of her ability to take you into the characters lives and help you see the things in your own that may need addressing. You won't be disappointed!!
3,This is another good cd that us jazz fans can enjoy,"I have long been an admirer of Warren's music. I remember when he was one of the main players on Rosemary Clooney's cds. That was back in the 80's. It seems like he always had a good sound on Rossie's songs. I had wondered how he would do as a soloist. Well Warren has passed the test of a solosist with flying colors.For this cd Warren plays a mixture of ballads and other songs. This cd is a good one for the most part. There were a few tunes that I could never warm up to, but I guess you can't please all the people with every song you record, so in compromise I guess this cd works fine.I am anxiously wanting to buy more cds by Warren. I feel like there are more great things to come from this talented musician.I Would Like To Recommend This CD"
2,Too short & too easy...,I bought this game 2 weeks ago and paid $25 on Amazon. Game Stop offered only $6 for a trade-in value. What does that tell you. This game took me only 5hrs to complete. Not worth the money.
4,Good product !,I do tape transcription and use/abuse this machine several hours a day. This is a good product at a reasonable price. My current machine has been in use for over 2 years and is still working fine.
4,great book for casual walker,"I really enjoyed reading this book, full of wonderful descriptions of easy, scenic walks. It gives lots of arguments for why you should try walking in Britain and lots of information for how to prepare. I decided I wanted to do mostly more strenuous hikes than what's covered here, but this book was my inspiration to think about seeing Britain on foot."
5,not for the meek,"This movie is an experience. Earthy and touching ,it pulls few punches.It features probally Wuhrer's best performance. Chong delivers a terrific performance as well.Lou Diamond Philips gives a great performance as the despicable pimp. The cast performances are excellent right down the line.The movie shows a side of life that most people really don't understand and gives us a chance to feel with and for the characters.The sometimes brutal and shocking nature of some of the scenes make it tough to watch but it is effective.It's not a movie you will forget about quickly.It also leads us to believe there is hope for tenderness and personal humanity at any level of existance.Hidden amongst the nudity,the sleaze,the shocks,there is a gem.This is worth watching."
2,Rae Dawn Chong is lovely but ...,"Fleeing from an abusive boyfriend, Jennefer (Kari Wuhrer) hops a bus to Toronto and ends up on the Boulevard, where prostitutes, drug dealers and the down and out reside. Ola (Rae Dawn Chong), who works the corner, takes her in from the cold. Hassan (Lou Diamond Phillips) is the local pimp. Eventually Jennefer takes up prostitution as well, and she and Ola must dodge Hassan, the cops and Jennefer's boyfriend who has come to find her.In the midst of incredible brutality all around, the two women fall in love. The love scene is wonderfully sensual and memorable. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is lacking, and the Hassan character in particular is a cardboard stereotype. It's just another abusive boyfriend/evil pimp film."
5,Pleasantly surprised,"This was one of those I sort of HAD to read ,and expected to be boring. But I learned more about music in the process, not just classical music. It just kept surprising me with it's entertaining, yet informative stuff I never expected. Maybe it was just something I needed at the time, because (if you read my other reviews) I'm usually VERY critical."
3,A bad-great book...,"It's amazing. Such a good book, so annoyingly written.Pluses: VERY informative, very comprehensive, an excellent primer for classical music and orchestras and musical instruments, music theory, terminology, a disk with a chapter critically examining the music.Minuses: so packed with sickly, soppy, low-rent humor that it comes off as a red-neck version of textbook.Without the silliness, this book would have been 1/2 as big. There is a lot of information, a lot of illustration/photos, a great spread of information. Because of the writing style, most people will probably have difficulty taking more than 10 or 20 pages a day. If you want to learn about classical music, this is the book, especially if you love ""greeting card"" humor by the ton."
2,Leaves a Bad Taste in the Mouth,"I bought this book a couple of years ago when I was a true classical music dummy. I can tell you that at the time, I enjoyed the history section as a means of giving me a rough musical chronology, as well as the listener's recommendations. Much of the book, though, is really...silly? Is that the word? Sophomoric? Moronic? We learn, for example, that Berlioz was a lunatic - that's the general impression, we get. The descriptions of the composers and their musical traits sounds a lot like Joan Rivers's red carpet quips on Oscar night. ""Love the concerto, darling, but oh! What are going to do about that hair?""If you have to get this book because it feels safe and easy, then do it. But please realize there's sooooooo much more out there to help you get a grip on the world of classical music. I recommend Schonberg's Lives of the Great Composers as well as Robert Greenberg's outstanding set of lectures available at the Teaching Company website. Check them out!"
5,Greatly Exceeded Expectations,"Like so many others, I too was reluctant to buy ""for Dummies"" books. I did on a lark to satisfy my periodic self-improvement yearnings and I am so glad I did. This is a not only informative, but a delightful read. I feel that every subject was covered an then some. I especially loved that the authors ""earthed"" the exalted subject of classical music. A must-have for anyone who wants to put the music in perspective."
4,"Great book, but please no more jokes","As an introductory primer to classical music, this book is ideal. Perhaps the best things in the book are the CD sampler it contains and the chapter that provides a second-by-second analysis of what you are hearing. For me, this was the best way to learn how to listen to classical music.Like other books in the ""Dummies"" series, this is filled with jokes. They became tedious after about three pages and detract from the otherwise valuable information presented."
3,"Poorly written, but still helpful since it fills a gap","To me, this book reads as if it has been thrown together in a hurry specifically to profiteer on a new industry. Virtually everything I've read seems blatantly cut and pasted from white papers and press releases from industry players (with not enough filtering to remove sales-pitch hyperbole), the diagrams that are supplied seem rushed, and many descriptions of visual topics (such as how a particular interface is laid out) are bizarely missing figures/snapshots.However, in a nascent industry like this, the mere act of collating all the literature knocking around into one volume does the readership a service - so, despite itself, the ""Essential Guide ..."" is worth getting hold of.Roll on more considered and value-adding books on the subject."
1,The silliest book I've read lately,"I have to imagine that this book was assembled by copy-and-paste from vendor's web sites, accompanied by ""technical"" additions by an author who either doesn't know what he's writing, or doesn't know how to write it. Examples are found on every page, but here's just one: on page 162, there's a subsection heading entitled ""Support for Internet standards."" It's a subsection of a rambling and wrong section about ""Set-top Proxy Server Software."" Here's the entire text of that subsection: ""All set-top proxy servers provide protocol support for Internet protocols."" How enlightening! Not. I think this book is a waste of time and money."
4,Learned a lot,"My job has required me to catch up on the interactive TV situation. I also found handy having the book ""The Interactive Television Dictionary & Business Index"" as ""The Essential Guide..."" doesn't have a glossary and can use more technical jargon than I sometimes understand. ""The Interactive Television Dictionary & Business Index"" is also information packed, though perhaps easier to read."
2,The Essential Guide to Digital Set-Top Boxes and Interative TV,"I received this book two days ago. Unfortunately, all figures and fotos are damaged (smudgy print). I would like to replace it.Thanks,Uvermar"
4,Useful handbook for the entry-level,"Working for a leading set-top-box manufacturer in Taiwan, I found this book useful for entry-level sales/engineers in this field. The book covers most topics of the set-top techniloies. However, the lacking of advanced technical analysis may disappoint people who already had knowledge in this field. To conclude, it's a good book worthy of reading."
4,I only used the practice tests in this book,"I took the AP Statistics test almost two years ago but I still remember how this book helped me prep for it because I found it so helpful. Before, all the equations were jumbled up in my head but after going through practice test after practice test from this book, I felt more and more confident. When I took the test, I breezed through it and ended up with a 5. The reason I didn't give 5 stars to this book is that the practice tests weren't exactly like the actual test. But that's not a big deal because the practice tests were good preparation anyway, and I don't think any other book has more accurate tests. After all, the AP Statistics test has only been around a few years. My teacher is the one who gave us the practice tests from this book and he is a grader of the AP test so he's someone you can trust."
2,not the greatest,"unfortunately i didnt look at any other ap stats review books since i was forced to get this one by my teacher but this one wasnt that great. I went into the AP test thinking the questions would mirror those on Baron's practice exams but they didnt. Also, many of the answer explanations in barons arent sufficient. Its not a terrible book and it probably helped me a bit with practicing, but i could have done without it."
3,"Useful, but updated edition needed","I used this book to review for the 2001 AP statistics exam in class. It was very useful because my class was taught using a standard college statistics book, and lacked the depth needed to do well on the exam. When used over nearly and entire semester, I practically relearned statistics using this book. The review chapters are extremely useful and very in depth. They cover everything you need to know for the exam at the level you need to know it.However, the end of chapter and review test problems are a different story. They were designed after the old form of the test which stressed calculator usage. However, when taking the test, I found that most of the review problems were nothing like the ones on the actual test. Luckily, I still managed to get a 5, because of the review chapters. This is definitely a book that you need to start at least 2 months before the actual test to let it all sink in."
3,Good Text,"I actually own Volumes 1 and 2. I mistakenly bought Vol. 1 AND the complete text that includes both Volumes. We covered both volumes in my physics classes. I think it is a very good text with good exercises.My teacher for the first semester was excellent and the text was a good tool for helping us learn the subject.My teacher for the second semester (where we started with circuits and moved on to electromagnetism, relativity, etc) was horrible, though, and the text was not adequate for helping me understand circuits. I needed to supplement the book with lots of specialized books from the school library in order to make up for my teacher's (and the text book's?) inadequacies.Still, I think the book is good enough and this review probably doesn't matter anyway since you are probably required to buy it for your class."
2,the day my virginity went away,"This disc is pretty boring. I mean, it was totally exciting that it was the first release from NIN in five years or whatever, but I never listen to it anymore. TDTWWA is probably my least favorite song off The Fragile."
1,Just buy The Fragile,This single contains what I consider to be the two worst songs from The Fragile. I can't imagine why anyone (other than collectors who get all the halos) would want to buy it.
2,not the best Trent can do,"Let's cut to the chase - it's pointless to argue with others' opinions on this. I usually enjoy NIN immensely, but I have to say this is not the greatest disc I've heard come out of his studios. Starf uckers inc. Is repetitive and poorly lyricized. I maintain my hope that The Fragile will top his previous record, The Downward Spiral in all fields. We shall see what we shall see."
1,"Yeah Right, Real Emotional","Trent is at it again. I would like to say that to anyone who thinks Trent's music is soul-baring, it ain't. TDTWWA's lyrics are like bad poetry from a suicidal person. Maybe these are his emotions, but they aren't creative, they aren't inspired, they are just dull and tacky. And Starfu%%%rs is beyond reasonable comprehension. The only sentiments I've ever heard that were more simplistic were the words from the poem Miniver Cheevey. Only a juvenile mind could write such appallingly laughable filth. Bob Dylan is an inspired lyricist. Stephen Malkmus is an interesting lyricist. Trent Reznor is a pretentious child who thinks he has something to contribute to the music world."
1,Trent must die,"I believe after hearing the new single that Trent Reznor's career is going downhill. After a long departure from working with NIN i think he's lost his touch, the perfect drug, then the day the world went away... hopefully the other 38 songs are better."
3,Trent is still the king...,i have to give this single 3 stars because the day the world was a little lame. i mean i love the fact that he's writing on piano more. star fkers is great and i believe it was written for courtney love. can't wait for the rest of it. mike
4,"The genius, hard at it.","Trent Reznor has done it once again with his newest release The Fragile. Although I believe there were too many years between The Downward Spiral and The Fragile, the wait was well worth it. The ""left"" CD dove you down deep into Reznor's psyche, and the ""right"" made you believe you were never coming out. I recommend this CD set to anyone who likes to think as well as being entertained."
2,People should post what they feel,"First, I think anyones opinion should count, not the only the ones who like NIN. If they only posted if they liked it (and this isn't limited to NIN cds) everything would have 5 stars, and that would take the point out of criticism.Anyway, I've bored you enough. I love The Fragile, but this is pretty crappy. Star Fuckers is terrible, and The Day the world went away is pretty good, but doesn't match the Fragile. Well, I've bored you enough! GOODBYE"
5,The Day The World Went Away,"This song is just so beautiful and amazing, 2 words you usually don't hear about a industrial band thats been around about 20 years.... anyways, The Fragile ( Halo 14) i might go as far as to say it was better than TDS... but I'm no moron lol I remember seeing NIN on the Fragility 2000 V2.0 Tour...very just awesome, sorry my jaw dropped haha."
2,He can do better.,"Considering the gruops on the labels he owns besides Manson, are all experimental or jungle/ drill and bass/ drum and bass techno youd think Trent would have taken a clue and let himself be influenced by them, liek Squarepusher so on. But instead he has chosen to use technology not to make innovative ionterestign music but songs that sound liek they could have come off broken or tds. Starf..... is great actually, its what earned the 2 stars from me, up until when it erupts into STAR F-ERS INC!!!!! with the howling guitars and classic NIN style, it doesnt quite work with the techno drum and bass dubbiness of the rest of the track, so take off track one and 3, change the chorus sections of track 2, and youd have a great single. Maybe since he ahsnt left his house since 1994, he thinks its onyl 1995 or soehting, but it isnt, and this is old"
2,NIN needs to change which clearly hasn't happened here,"I've followed Trent Reznor and his crew for quite a while, and I've loved his music. With the comming of this album everybody said his music was going to change, to such an extent that his band was to disclame him and name the album Trent Reznor opposed to Nine Inch Nails. This rather excited me and I was quite dissapointed when I heard this music. It was exactly the same as the Downward Spiral. Trent needs to change and gets some new ideas in."
4,good job Trent!,"I have to say that I was very happy with Trent's latest. The title song, although a little slow, has great musicality, yet the B-side, Starf**kers, Inc., has great guitars that get the blood pumping. It was my favorite out of the two. I like this because it melds every aspect of his previous albums into one:you get the techno feel of PHM and Downward Spiral with the edgy guitar of Broken. I just hope The Fragile is just as good!"
2,Disappointing,"I was expecting something COMPLETELY different, based on all I had been reading in the press. The Day the World Went Away is similar to Hurt, and Starf***ers sounds like plenty of other NIN. I still look forward to the new album, but my expectations are now considerably lower. Basically, I was disappointed with this single. Hopefully, it will grow on me as it has on other listeners."
5,Finally,I got this the first day it came out and i loved it.. i was floored when i listened to it and still am.. leaves you Needing more of his new stuff..
5,leaves you begging for more,"If you appreciate the subtelties of emotional music, you're in for a treat. This isn't your average head-banging, louder than loud, angry as hell, hard rock/industrial music. Trent surpasses the trappings of contemporary music as he weaves thought-provoking, intelliegnt lyrics into an explosively genuine music machine."
2,not his best,"just not his best work. i'm sure there are many better songs on his album he could've chosen to put out as a single, but he had to be an idiot and do the isolation bit. the thing that really bugged me, though, was the fact that there were only two versions of the song on this. from a nin single you'd expect to get three or four. i remember getting 'head like a hole' and getting shocked that there were ten songs on it.if the fragile is anything like the songs he put on this single, there's no way it'll sell as good as the downward spiral. not that that's a bad thing...it's just that these suck."
1,"If you can't beat them, don't join them.","Trent needs to either evolve with his music or quit. He is putting out the same lame songs he's been putting out since the late 80's. It's a sign of failure when bands on your own label are better than you. Whatever he went through to make this album, he needs to do the reverse to make his next one. I hope this slump breaks eventually, because my friend listens to him, and I don't want to have to listen to another wack cd."
3,The fragile intro album,"I give this a 3 because although I love NIN, two songs are really Fragile outtakes, but that's fine if you're in fear of buying the album. The only thing added is a 'quiet' version, although it's very enjoyable and the piano in it was the most liked thing in it. Though not the place to start, nice attempt."
5,"Great songs, i can't stand waiting for the album !!","Starf***ers inc. is a great nin song, kinda march of the pigs but even better. The quiet version of the day the world want away is better than the original one i think. The porter ricks remix is maybe a bit too repetitive, but anyway, NIN always makes great music"
4,This Is a good CD,"The Day the World Went Away is a good song, but nothing like Starf***ker.It instantly become a favorite for me."
3,Beginning of the end for NIN...,"I was looking forward to NIN's new album that was due out, and The first day this single was released I bought it... and was let down. The Day the World Went Away is a good song, and the quiet version is even better, but something was missing, and I desperately disliked Star**kers. I give it 3 stars because granted it wasn't a great purchase it cost me like 3 or 4$ so I can't complain...and at least I enjoyed the anticipation of listening to new NIN, even though it was less than I expected."
3,Two of the weaker songs on an otherwise excellent album,"Lyrically both songs are mediocre and Trent's vocals are the worst I've heard in years. But don't let that fool you. ""The Fragile"" is astounding. So unless you're a devoted NINnie, skip this and go straight for ""The Fragile"""
3,It was tolerable.,"I liked both ""The Day The World Went Away"" and ""The Day The World Went Away"" (quiet), but Starf*ckers was quite dreadful. Not only were the lyrics bad, but the music was unpleasant and repetitive."
3,"""World"" whets the appetite","Reznor returns with an unlikely first offering from the upcoming album. ""World"" is more in the vein of the experimental tunes on Downward Spiral and Further and features little vocals or melody. Starfuckers, Inc. however, blows the roof off like the Pigs are Marching right on through. In the bridge Reznor sings a snippet of ""You're So Vain"" and one can't help but think this song is regarding Marilyn Manson, who recently parted personal and professional ties with Trent. The song rocks from beginning to end, and the ""World"" reconstruction is swell, also. Not prime NIN, but worthy."
1,Europe Is Obviously On The Decline,"I guess Europe has finally slipped into the cultural toilet. All I have to say is that this album is trash. Depressing lyrics do not turn me off. Stereotypical, stylized lyrics that show no effort do turn me off. And as to Miles: ""On The Corner"" and ""In A Silent Way"" have more integrity and brilliance in their first notes than this entire album. Miles was no commercial artist, because he changed. Reznor is doing the same thing he has always done, in an attempt to keep fans. Reznor's fanbase is as stupid as him if they think he is revolutionary."
2,966696.,"I think most of the reviews I've read of this single, both here and elsewhere, have been either too harsh or too Trent-adoring. Trent as a pretentious, mopey juvenile is no big news -- if you don't accept that about him, I'm not sure why you'd be out at the store buying NIN discs in the first place. At the same time, to say this single is ""genius"" strikes me as pretty damn silly; if it speaks to you in some way, that's great, but really this is just an extension of the stuff heard on The Downward Spiral, nothing exceedingly innovative (and certainly disappointing to those of us who were thinking the bands on the Nothing label would have been influencing him.) Starfkrs has some nice techno but it's a really stupid song, with painfully trite vocals and lyrics. The ""Nah Nah Nah-ing"" on the last track can be nerve-grating at times too. I have to admit Trent's voice has the most appeal when it's put through effects and muted a bit."
3,New NIN Album Is In Danger of Being Over-hyped,"Is it just me, or is the new NIN album to music what the new Star Wars installment is to movies? I mean, we've been waiting for the new album forever, and it just seems as though Trent can never meet our expectations. I was pleased with the single, but I am not convinced that it lives up to Trent's description of the new material. That it'll ""piss people off."" Sorry, but these tracks are FAR from new or innovative. ""Star Inc."" sounds too much like Manson; not that Trent wasinfluenced by them, but I think he put too much of his style into that band. ""The Day the World Went Away"" is a different version of ""Hurt"" as far as I'm concerned. The problem with the single will also be a problem for the album - - it is simply overhyped. Judging from the reaction of the single, NIN will be hard pressed to fill the stadiums that they did with Bowie. Innovation can't be achieved with this material because it's been done before - - even by Trent."
4,A number 17 Hit,This was actually a Top 20 hit by Tool I am not actually a big NIN fan but I need that Joe Dirt review to standLyrics 7/10 Production 10/10 Overall 8.5/10
5,Excellent. Trent Reznor is on with this one.,You have to be a true Nine Inch Nails fan to understand. A great mix of sounds.
4,A great single worth the money,"I think this single is well worth buying. Starfuckers, Inc. is proof that trent can still write a good heavy thrash and still not sound like a song that has alreadfy been mastered. TDTWWA at first doesn't seem that great but the more I listen to it the more I like it. I love listening to hard metal from korn, Coal Chamber, Limp Bizkit and others. but it's nice to play a good song that isn't as heavy and gives you a break form all the loud guiatrs and screaming. the Quiet version is also good. it's must buy."
2,"Simple does not mean ""inventive.""","As much as I would like to think this is Trent being ""inventive"" or ""breaking new ground,"" I can't help but conclude this is a simple, not very listenable, song. I hope the album proves to be better. The best of the 3 songs is #3 -- the silent version. It is reminiscent of Pretty Hate Machine."
2,Looks like old documentory,"I bought this DVD hoping to find something to keep me cool through a hot summer and help me to just relax. I figured that it would be good quality for being almost $15. There were shots through the windshield where the reflection of the inside of the car could be seen as well as the dirt on the windshield. It's almost as if a novice filmmaker took a video camera outside, added some music, and said ""That outta do it."" It didn't."
2,really pretty silly,"Gerda Charles writes like she's in a great hurry, but also like she doesn't have the least idea what's happening next. The characters could have (presumably) fallen out of a Harlequin romance, but it is really the prose style that is embarrassing. Another novel of hers, 'Slanting Light', was so bad I defy anyone to get through the first couple of chapters. Oh well."
4,"excellent, but not as good as her highness","i got this album a few years after i picked up medicine's later release 'her highness' which i have been jocking to everyone who will listen to me for the past eight years. while this album was great, it didn't quite live up to my admittedly impossible standards. but that's not to say this album doesn't crush the skull of just about everything else, because it really does. tracks like ""one more"" somehow manage to be soothing while tearing your earholes a new a%%hole. and ""short happy life"" is so damn sexy and beautiful. i love it. buy it."
3,No Orchestra!,"The cast and their voices are wonderful. But I didn't realize that this CD, fromthe original cast of the revival at Goodspeed, is with piano only. Doesn't give you the full impact of such glorious music. It does, however, show you that the show CAN be done without a full orchestra...in case any community theatres, high schools, or budget-minded companies are looking for a great old book musical with some wonderful music.BUT, if you're looking for a great CD of the production, I would steer away from this production in favor of one of the others that have the full orchestras accompanying them.DennisMusical Theatre Actor/Producer from Seattle"
1,"Please READ the album cover for ""The Most Happy Fella.""","Please read the album cover - this is NOT the original cast recording of ANY production of ""The Most Happy Fella."" The is an album of instrumental arrangements of selections from ""The Most Happy Fella"" played by Percy Faith and his orchestra. Amazon - the description needs to be changed to remove the names of the Broadway performers and replaced with Percy Faith!The Most Happy Fella"
5,Best Album EVA!,"This is the NO1 Album of the Year!!! ""BEST EVA!""Ths Boy Chris Brown has talent!!!! 16 (Nearly 17)!My top 5:Run ItYo (Excuse me miss)WinnerAint no WayRun it Remix (ft Bow Wow)Whoever doesnt have Chris Browns First Album you have to Buy it because i know you won't be disapointed, people he is only 16 what 16 yr olds can sing/dance as well as Chris Brown! know1!So Buy this Album!! 4 Chris!*Chris_Brown_Fan!*"
5,Wow,"This Cd Is Fiyah, Chris is Doing His Thing He's Obviously Very Talented, And My Fav Songs Are Gimmie That,Your Man Ain't Me, and The Run It So So Def Remix. Its A Hott Album That Ya'll Need to Get! Do Ya Thang CB!"
5,Respect is well deserved,"For Chris to be a new artist, he has proven his point that he is here to stay. Not even been out 2 years and he has headlined his own tour. He can put it down on stage as well, both signing and dancing. You can ride to the whole CD. How is he going to top this one? He is going to have a lot of pressure on his shoulders. You wont be disappointed."
5,Chris Brown's Review,"I LOVE EVERY SINGLE LAST SONG ON THE ALBUM. IT IS A 5 STAR IN MY BOOK. I LOVE ""POPPIN"",""WINNER"",""WHAT'S MY NAME?"" AND OTHERS. THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS OF THE YEAR SO FAR. DID I MENTION THAT HE IS VERY SEXY. !!!!"
1,Soft Girly Over-rated Motown,"Other than the hit song Run It & Gimmie That, the rest of the cd is soft girly over-rated motown. I recommend this cd to girls but not heterosexual guys."
1,You Serious,He has an anoying voice and he is claimed to be the future. All he has a is a big ego and a face that girls like. Girls only buy this CD because he has a cute face. I'm telling you right now to save your money and buy something that is worth spending your money on.
3,Chris Brown - Chris Brown,"This is a great cd and music - Run it probably being the highlight. One really annoying thing about how SonyBMG havepackaged this is that no matter what you do you cannot downloadon to a computer music program. It has something installed in it which will only let you download the CD straight on to your hard drive. This in fact spoils the CD and on that basis I would not recommend buying this product. (Shame, because the music is worth listening to)"
5,The best,This cd is by far the best since Usher's Confessions. I think it should go to the top of the billboards. This young phenom is the next big thing.
5,It's like Mc Donalds cause I'm lovin it,"lol but it's true It's like Mc Donalds cause I'm lovin it...Chris Brown is a youngblood but he keeps it true to his age group. He has a young soundin voice but a good one. I love all his songs especially Ya Man Ain't Me, Winner, and Ain't No Way. All I can say is keep up the good work and God will take you far!!!!!! Everyone that hasn't bought the cd and is inbetween on buying it or not I'm tellin you it is worth it so gon head and use that 10-15 dollars on this cd because you won't be sorry :)"
5,Oh My Gosh !!!!,I love this album i got it the first day it came out it is so good the songs the beats i just can't even explain it is one of those albums where you can just play it right through my favorite song is run it remix feat. Bowow and Jermain Durpri it is crazy so if you wanna hear that song and many others go buy the cd it is in stores now you have to get it!!!!!
5,Chris Brown CD,I love his album it's the best one i have heard in years! And i like how he mixed the bluesy type hip hop songs into one CD. His songs are mostly slow but they make you want to sit and enjoy them numerous times. He has a great voice and i can't wait to get the next CD.
4,Impressing,"I was a little skeptical about getting Chris Brown's album, mainly because he's so young to me (I'm only seventeen myself Ha Ha). However, I loved ""Run It!"" and his performance at the Vibe awards was hot! So, I reluctantly got it. It surprised me how good it was. This kid has some talent. My favorites are ""Yo,"" ""Ain't No Way,"" ""Is This Love,"" and especially ""Poppin'."""
4,Run It! Chris I give 4 1/2 stars,"I love this album the best debut album in a while, It's better than Ciara's and better than Omarions or Usher's were. Chris is far ahead and is the ""Future of R&B;""1. Run It: A2. Yo (Excuse Me Miss): A+3. Young Love: B4. Gimme That: A-5. Ya Man Ain't Me: A+6. Winner: B7. Ain't No Way: B8. What's My Name: C9. Is This Love: B+10. Poppin': A11. Just Fine: A-12. Say Goodbye: A13. Run It feat. Bow Wow & JD (Remix): B+14. Thank U: B-Vocals: AProduction: ALyrics: BOverall: B+"
5,more than JUST FINE,"Finally an artist who can both SING and DANCE live! So rare these days. This album is refreshing, fun, and light hearted. Even the breakup songs leave you in a good mood. His voice is a beautiful high tenor and the melodies will melt your cynical RnB loving heart. My favorites so far are Just Fine, Poppin, Winner, and Ya Man Ain't Me."
5,Chris Definetly Has It!!,Virginia native Chris Brown is an upcoming star! Every one of his songs my personal favorite is Gimme That followed by Yo. I definetly encourage you if you dont have the albulm definetly go and by it also join the i-squad!!!
2,CRIS BROWN IS THE HOTTEST GUY,Cris you are sooo cute and when i saw your video Run It you blew me out. I kept puting your video on and on. Im 13.
1,Impressively Awful.,"This lame brained usher wanna be debut is just as awful as it is, lame songs, idiotic lyrics and other terrible stuffChris brown tries to be the 2000's version of usher, but he fails.Usher in the 90's had style, charm and heart and this one doesn't."

1,future of r&b whatever,"usher, omarion, mh, trey sungz, bobby valentino now chris brown we sure getting a lot of homie sexuals today in the music biz but hey all the little girls need somebody to drool over throughout their pubic years why not put out trash and promote them as the michael jackson of the millenium screw chris brown this cd sucks and for 13 year old girls only he dances like a retard on speed."
5,Young and on fire!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Chris Brown's debut album is the best album of 2005 in my oppinion.It's like he brought a whole new flavor to the music industry.The songs on this cd are so good and refreshing.If his first album is this good,I can't wait to see how his next album will be.My favorite songs on the cd are Yo![excuse me miss],Young Love,Winner,Ain't No Way[you won't love me],Poppin,Say Goodbye,and Thank You.I encourage you to go out and get this album,trust me,you'll be glad you did."
3,Sure.... Why not,"People need to understand that their opinion helps people decide rather to purchase a CD or not. I personally read about 5 or 6 different view points before my purchase. With that being said, here's my view:Chris Brown CD was about 3 ? stars for me. It was nothing special but with the music being played today, it was truly one of the better albums I've heard lately. The album was smooth and relaxing. It made me think about my teenage years. I was able to listen to this album with my 14 years old sister without wishing she would turn it off.I believe most people would not be upset if they brought this CD but if you have a few others albums you're thinking about getting first, I would.LOL - Perfect gift for the young teenage girl, not adults."
5,My Husbands CD,OMG...THIS CD IS OFF THE HOOK....I JUST LOVE THE MESSAGES THAT HE SEND OUT TO US GIRLS. ALSO I LIKE IT BECAUSE IT ISN'T ALL OF THAT DISREPECTING GIRL TYPE SONGS OR LIKE PARENTAL ADVISORY TYPE CD....I JUST LVOE IT AND IF I WERE YOU I WOULD GO AND BUY TIS CD...U'LL ENJOY IT AS MUCH AS I DO...I BOUGHT MYSELF 4CDS... THAT IS HOW GOD TIS CD IS///TRUST M...U'LL LIKE IT...SO GO OUT RIGHT NOW AND BUY IT....WELL IF U DO END UP BUYIN IT HOPE U ENJOY
1,More MTV-produced garbage..,"This album is proof that all you need is a 'pretty face' to get by in life. Chris Brown, and most of the mainstream R&B scene is garbage. The people that're calling this impressive are obviously uneducated, or just a product of the music television brainwashed generation. This is not music; this is trash."
1,Absolutely Unacceptable,"I can't stand the way this kid sings. It's like he's shouting throughout his songs in a whiny high-pitched voice. It really irritates me that a 16 year old wants to sing like a 12 year old. It's not gonna work. Chris Brown really needs to get some vocal lessons and fast because he knows nothing about range. I wasn't impressed with his debut album either- it was boring, nothing unique about it at all. Just the same old same old stuff you here on FM radio. There wasn't even at least one ballad on the CD that had the potential of being a classic and could be sung on American Idol. I have no idea how this boy got a record deal, but there are plenty of teenage boys out there who can dance and actually sing. Skip this all costs."
3,Potential to do better,"This album is quite good, but after the first release (Run It), the rest is a little disappointing, making me feel like he might become a one hit wonder. I hope not, because I think he's talented and there is room to do better, but for now I think he needs some fine tuning. Other than Run It, the songs to look out for are Young Love, Poppin, Just Fine and Winner. This could have been better, but overall it's not a bad effort. At least you can jam to a lot of the songs, - I just don't think there will be heaps of hits."
4,Chris Brown,The Cd is good! its what i expected it to be. i can listen to most of the cd w/o skipping the song.
5,THAT BOY IS SOO HOT!,EVERYBODY NEED TO GIVE CHRIS BROWN HIS DO JUSTICE. HES VERY HOT AND HE'S GOING TO MAKE IT VERY FAR IN LIFE AND PLUS I LOVE CHRIS BROWN AND HOPEFULLY I WILL GET TO MEET HIM IN PERSON.
5,Yeah,Thats what I am talking about R & B music that will put you in the mood for a special night with the one you love and bring back beautiful and sometimes sad memories but its all good Thank you
3,Chris Brown Album,The music is amazing and if you're thinking about getting the album definitely get it. But when I got this album in the mail the case it was in was broken. It was terrible like it was crushed somehow. I didn't return it because the cd wasn't damaged and I really wanted it so I just dealt with it. AMAZING ALBUM tho!!!!
5,Chris Brown starts off GREAT,Dont be the only one withouit this cd.His debut cd shows his versatility and his musical genius.Every song from ballads to club bangers are fire.
1,content protected,"WHY EVEN BUY THIS PRODUCT YOU CAN""T USE IT ON MOST FORMATS>>>ENOUGH IS ENOUGH JIVE RECORDS GET A GRIP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Item received does not look like the picture,"The item I received did not look like the item shown in the picture. The color, stitching and Kipling label were all different. The customer service was helpful, however, and provided me with a few options to compensate me for the problem.The product itself, however, is a good product with lots of compartments to keep things organized."
5,Kipling,I have ordered lots of kipling from Amazon or the Kipling web site. This is always a great gift for friends in Asia. They really like this brand.
5,I love this wallet!,"It is a great wallet if you are animal friendly and don't want leather. It is well made and has several sections and pockets. Also a checkbook holder. It keeps all my money, receipts, cards and coupons organized. I just have to remember to empty out my change every few days or it gets too heavy."
5,Great book,This book is full of wonderful and intelligent insights. I particularly enjoyed the sections on Agnes Smedley.
2,Forgettable R&H,I have owned a CD copy of this show for at least 15 years. I listened to it once. I haven't listened to it since. I can't even recall a single note of music. And I think R&H are the greatest. RCA's recording as I recall was heavily cut with very boxy mono sound.
3,Minor League Rodgers and Hammerstein,"PIPE DREAM is minor league Rodgers & Hammerstein, at best, sandwiched between the standouts of OKLAHOMA!, SOUTH PACIFIC, and THE SOUND OF MUSIC. William Johnson and Helen Traubel in the lead roles are in fine voice, but most of the songs seem like castoffs from other shows by lesser writers. A few of the tunes are nice, including ""The Next Time It Happens,"" but ""The Tidee Pool"" comes across as a CAROUSEL reject. Orchestrations are by the great Robert Russell Bennett, but again they are nothing special. PIPE DREAM is one of the OBC recordings that should be in every comprehensive Broadway or at least R&H collection, but otherwise it's not an essential purchase for the average person interested in Broadway musicals."
4,"Music 10, Show... ""Needs Work,"" but...!","This ""Pipe Dream"" CD is very 50's rich-voiced in its recording, so in some ways anyone listening to it with an eye on producing it might be put off by it. As it is, abridges abound, with some of the best (like ""Bum's Opera,"" which is a blast) really cut short. Make no mistake--it's great Rodgers and Hammerstein. Read the book (you can find it in some libraries) and see what life you can imagine into it. It is obscure because people in 1956 who were ""important"" deemed it was lesser R & H. Give it a spin and see what you think. I'm betting you'll see ""All at Once"" is right up there with ""Hello Young Lovers"" and the loveable bums from Cannery Row will grow on ya!"
3,For beginners only,It is a useful tool only if you don'y know much about immigration law. Much more info is avaiable on the internet.
2,Nice but defective,"The holster seems to be constructed well. The gun fits nicely into it. It states in the description that it will fit on a belt up to 2 1/4 inch wide. That is true IF you are using the metal belt clip and not the sewn in belt loop that will only accept an inch and 1/4 wide belt. Using the metal belt clip on the belt on the outside of the waist does not provide a stable attachment of the holster; I would not use it this way. The snap on the strap that secures the back of the gun to the thumb break, broke off so now the strap in non-functioning. This snap failure happened right out of the package. I have purchased and used other Uncle Mike's products since they were of good quality but this one is of low quality. I am returning this holster."
4,Well Built,"It's exactly what it should be, but I'm not going into details. I will say that the thumb release takes some effort, but I'm sure it'll wear in after a handful of uses. Excellent construction. Fits the Ruger SR22 very nicely."
2,OK,"Purchased because of a magazine review. Was supremely disappointed. Only liked 1 track and not even that much. I would sample it first before purchasing. Not as good as say, Beastie Boys instrumentals."
4,A good review,This was a good book to read. I read this book recently. I have never lived on a houseboat but I have been in several boats. This book was completely different from the previous book in the series. The first book was good because I was in the age group when I had the book read to me by my school teacher.
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this teleconverter to use with my 18-55mm and 50-200mm lenses (mainly the latter). While the construction is solid, the image quality is not what I was expecting. Images are soft, colours lose their intensity, and chromatic aberration increases. It seems TCs are better used with prime lenses, but results were not much better when I tested it with a 50mm f/1.4.If you don't mind losing some image quality, then this TC may be of use to you; otherwise, spend more money on one made by Pentax."
2,To much for dogs/ No appreciable difference,"You have to put such a large amount of this product with the dog food that it makes the meal extremely dry and the dog doesn't want to eat it. Because I restrict her water for 1 hour after she had eaten to elemanate the problem of BLOAT large dogs can have we usually have to add a little milk to get her to finish her food. She eats on a schedule of 5:00 in the morning and evening that it is obvious that she wants to eat it but just cannot get it down. I tried this product to save money because the stuff I was using previously was so expensive. However I think I am going back to the old stuff because this product is putting pounds on her she doesn't need and also teaching her to expect milk added to her food at mealtime. Not a good thing. I am not satisfied with this product for large dogs.Shirley Whisman, Wichita Ks"
3,OK,"Just as advertised, this is a roll of foam you trim to fit. As a one-size-fits-all item it works ok, but it did leave gaps near the top of the tailgate. Not all tailgates have the same size gaps ans I am learning now, but it looks to keep most of the road-crap out until something gets dragged across it and rips the foam as this foam is not as tough as that you see in a new car's trunk seak."
3,Where was the editor?,"Boy, does this book need a good editor! It needs to lose at least 200 pages of more than we need to know exposition. There is a good story, but it takes too long for it to get going."
1,Thoroughly disappointing,"I bought this book in the airport, 5 minutes before my flight was due to take off, to give myself something to read. What an amazing waste of [money].I'm a fan of the genre in general, but this book is the worst I've read in a long time. Nowwhere near the class of David Morrell or even Tim Green.Honestly, I gave up and stared at my seatback after 150 pages. I just couldn't take any more. The characters are all one dimensional carictures, the central plot element is asinine (everyone is upset at Web London for surviving an ambush), its description of the difference between a psychologist and psychiatrist was painful, the FBI/military people just don't have realistic attitudes, the dialogue is stilted.... the list goes on.Save your time and money, skip this book."
4,Complicated but absorbing,"Baldacci has never matched his first novel 'Absolute Power' but 'Last Man Standing' is definitely better than his last few novels, which I found to be too simplistic. The story deals with a HRT operative who goes into brainfreeze during an operation leading to the massacre of the rest of his team and his personal investigation into all aspects of the incident.LMS is definitely not light reading. It has a truckload of characters, backgrounds on many of them, several tracks and lots of twists and turns. But it also has a strong story, interesting characters and many suspenseful sequences. More importantly, it ties things together neatly at the end without changing pace and holds some genuine surprises."
2,A Good Book Turned Mediocre,"I must admit that I for the most part enjoyed reading this book while recently on vacation. It is a long book with well developed characters that puts together an interesting and suspense filled mystery plot. Then, as the mysteries and riddles of the story begin to be resolved ... you become dissatisfied by how weak the resolution to the story ends up being. The story becomes weaker and weaker, and more and more unbelievable with every page beyond the midway point. By the end - you are sorely disapointed. SPOLIER ALERT - It would seem like David Baldacci just got bored of writing, since there is no coherent ending to the story. The book just ... finished, in what would appear to be the midway point to a longer story. Not recommended."
4,Recommended -- But Not To Everyone!,"If you a person who enjoys a thriller primarily for its suspense and excitement, Last Man Standing will have the pages flying through your fingertips. While the plot is pretty farfetched and strains credibility, it will most likely hold your interest. However, if strong, believable characters are more, or at least as, important to you as suspense and lots of action when choosing a thriller, then I think you'll feel (as I do) feel that Last Man Standing is entertaining and enjoyable but not fully satisfying. Although it didn't bother me as much as many other reviewers, the ""good guy"" characters --particularly Web London, the main character-- are too ""super hero-ish."" Further, Baldacci's characters in general are two-dimensional at best. Despite these flaws, I found Last Man Standing to be a fast-paced an entertaining read; and a book that I think you might enjoy when you're in the mood to read a book to purely escape from reality."
4,Good,"This is a solid thriller, and probably the best I've read since Craig Furrnas' THE SHAPE. Murder, mayhem, intrigue. What more can you ask!"
5,Best Damn Book EVER!,"This book is awesome you got to read it may be long but it makes up for it with a thrilling, and suspensful plot. David Baldacci has done it again! Just when I thought that I would never find a book I loved more then Absolute Power i find Last Man Standing. This book is so great that you'll read it faster than you knew you possibly could"
3,A pretty average read,"As far as reviews go most people are pretty accurate with their own reviews above so I will just concur with them. The story was quite long and it just didn't need to be. I'd say a 400 pages read would have been sufficient. The plot was not overly complex either. In fact anyone can really deduce most of the plot from the first hundred pages. There are a few twists that get ya in the end but it isn't as convincing since you already have a good idea about things. Definately not a thriller. The action was good but in between action the story would bog down. Also why is it every woman in this story was absolutely gorgeous, independant, and confident, yet at the same time they all were so reliant on the main character and it is almost as though every one wants him as well. I hate novels that do this. Be a little creative. However it was an entertaining read but nothing I would really recommend to anyone looking for a ""great"" book."
3,"NOT BAD, CERTAINLY NOT HIS BEST....","This book moves along, is interesting and fast paced....A good book for the beach or train."
3,Good Action Yarn Built on a Silly Plot,"Baldacci really drew me into the plot in spite of boring me to tears with his idealization of the F.B.I. Hostage Rescue Team. That's quite a feat. The trick was trying to figure out who was behind the massacre of the hero's HRT unit and why. It all came together at the end. Too bad it turned out to be so silly.All in all, if you have the time to read all 640 pages and don't mind an implausible plot, the book is entertaining."
1,Whoever Wrote the Jacket Cover - Never Read Ludlum,"This book is so ridiculously predictable that it would have been better if he'd left out chapters. (If you buy it, please skip chapter 21 as from there on... well, you'll get the idea.) At times you felt like the writer wrote himself into a corner and had to backtrack and insert a chapter to help the book make sense. Even then - the absurdity of all the pieces coming together - as they do in the end - is laughable. This guy writes nothing like Ludlum, Grisham, etal, and should not, however remotely, be considered to be in the same class. It is a beach book at best.NB: The review by Kristen White is one of four, three for Balducci, that she has written. Clearly she is his publicist, publisher, sister or in some way connected to Balducci. There is no way a review for this book, like the one she has written, is put forth without some outside motivation."
2,Boring and unfocused,I was very disappointed in this novel. It starts slow and plods for 500+ pages. It has no gripping focus. Too much information about horse farming that adds zero to the plot.
1,just can't finish all of 'em,"when i started this book and read the first chapter, i thought man o' man, this is classic baldacci. but then, just like someone snapped their fingers, it was over. what i forced myself to read turned into a bunch of mush about everything hrt. the concept was good, but it seemed like the author tried to tell us everything he learned in research in a chapter or two. as i was reading i caught myself thinking, i just don't care about all this extra. can we get to some story here? this book was incredibly boring to me and i never made it past the third chapter. sorry if i am ruining anyones day, but i loved the other baldacci books and this one is simply not up to the caliber he has shown before."
1,Needs to take writing 101,"Good guys, bad guys--black /white, no shades of gray. Lots of passive writing style.I've never seen such two dimensional characters in a book that is so popular.His use of English is very amateurish--I was tripping over his writing style--very distracting -- I had no empathy for any of his characters.I'm a Clancy, Ludlum, Follet fan with a taste for Stephen King sometimes. They are master storytellers with wonderful grasp of the English language. Their characters are three dimensional and have complexity.Baldacci's characters make comic books look like classics."
2,Ponderous machine,"At the beginning ,action every 100 pages, and boy do those pages drag. The plot is movie style convoluted and not close to reality based. How come we keep witnesses alive so long, when all that is intended is their demise?"
3,Typical,"Here is a prime example why I have strayed from contemporary fiction. Does every character in the story have to have a connection with the end result? Although the story was interesting, the plot fast paced, the climax was dissapointing. We get very little depth of any except the main characters. A fun summer read, but not a book you wished wouldnt end."
3,Not bad but falls at the last fence...,"FBI agent left as only survivor of an ambush tries to find the truth behind the incident.Very pacy story with a good background on Hostage Rescue (the author had help from Chris Whitcombe in this area) this book only lets itself down in the last fifth where too many co-incidences and links come together rather too quickly.Okay there is some dialogue that is weak but although some of the twists were a little signposted, some of them do still surprise. This is not an exceptional book, but if you like the authors previous works then I suspect you will like this one too."
1,Very disappointing,"I am extremely disappointed in this book. I thoroughly enjoyed all of his other books (especially ""The Winner""), but this one was slow & uninteresting. I have read 225 out of 548 pages and have finally given up on it."
1,One of the worst books ever written,"OK, so I exaggerate. But only a little. I can't believe (1) Baldacci actually submitted this for publication knowing his name would be associated with it, (2) a publishing house actually paid for the manuscript, and (3) I was dumb enough to read it. I think I'll take a pass on the author's other efforts."
2,A first try,The general admonition for beginning writers is to write what you know about. That should extend to successful authors who try to move into completely new territory. I was disappointed.
3,MACHO MAN !!!!!!,"This read was definitely for the gun-history and gun-loving group. The story was just a side track; the real story was about para-military and the macho men. The story was unbelieveable and made no sense. I want my money back!!! However, the ending was great. Look for another book about the characters left standing."
1,Last Man Standing -- UGH!,"Baldacci at his absolute worst. This is the kind of book that is hard to get into, boring in the middle and toward the end makes you wonder why you didn`t watch reruns of ""The Gong Show"" rather than wasting you time!!"
4,Vulagarity,"Very well researched book, very good writer, and excellant plot. Only disappointment was the unneccessary vulgarity which kept it from being a great book which could be recommended to a wider audience."
1,Last Man Was Last Chance,"David Balducci here proves the old saying that some writers only have one good book in them. Absolute Power was a knockout, I recommended it to everyone I knew. Following that, he published several disappointments but I kept hoping he'd find the old formula again.I put this book away with the marker on page 87. Enough is enough. The charactrs are wooden, the set ups preposterous and the action comicical. Balducci expects us to take everything about his character on faith, but gives no plausible reason why we should.I would love to see him try to diagram some of his tortured run on sentences. Where is the editing? Where is the restraint? Where is Stephen Hunter when you need him?"
1,A Real Downer,"I found this to be a horribly violent and depressing book. Sure, life can be violent and messy, but I don't have to go to fiction to experience that. This is a real nightmare of a mystery, all too well depicting the ugly underbelly of our world today. But if you like that kind of thing, you'll probably enjoy the book. It's just not my cup of tea."
5,Great intrigue for a fall drive,A friend suggested this audio book for our fall color trip. Having never read the author before I was a little confused at the start but by the end I am anxious to read and hear more of Balldacci. Excellent for the triller enthusist.
2,Oh so very average,"I read Absolute Power and was looking for his next novel.Last Man Standing is very mediocre.Huge plot holes.One example, page 488 (out of 548), Kevin (a nine year old) picks a locked door with parts from a pen - right, I believe that ~ not!...P>It's not a bad book, just not a very good book.Easy to read, just hard to visualize real people doing some of the things in it..."
1,slow and poorly written,"I thoroughly enjoyed Baldacci's previous books and was looking forward to this one, but I was very disappointed. The book is excruciatingly slow: I am on page 340 out of over 500 pages and struggling to finish. Nothing much seems to have happened since the opening scene, and the plot doesn't make much sense. The writing is poor, and the characters are mostly not very interesting or believable. So far, the best word to describe this book is boring."
2,Carelessness reigns!,"I was really annoyed by the blatant grammatical errors - this book could have been proof-read by a grammar school drop-out! (or perhaps a graduate school student).Doesn't anyone care about correctusage these days? And doesn't anyone know the difference between ""me"" and ""I"" or ""can"" and ""may""?Too, the characteristic soul searching of the protagonists is boring!"
1,Boring and Racist.,"I found this book to repetitive. It just keeps going on and on, on how bad Web feels about the death of his 7 team mates. Also, it has harsh racist descriptions on some characters that don't really add to the story at all. It just adds to the stereotype of how life is in Annacostia, Washington DC. One such description is that of the black grandmother of the missing kid. She is described as a big black woman about the sides of a small car with big breast and lives in a house full of rat excrements. I don't recommend this book at all, but if you are a narrow minded white male, who thinks that he is at the top of the hill looking down on the rest, this book is for you."
2,a real plodder,"Having read only ""Absolute Power"" by Baldacci, I wasn't sure what to expect with this latest. Maybe I've read too many Clancy plots, but this one certainly was disappointing. I wasn't even sure I would finish it, finding it so full of cliches and stereotyping that I was aggravated. Seems like the author simply took several ""in"" subjects and meshed (or is that messed) them together for a plot that was too complicated.Many characters were shallow, and the two locales of the storyline were also unbelievable. Most irritating of all, however, was that London was so invincible. I will think twice before opening another by Baldacci.Besides that, I again spotted several typos, i.e., words not caught by spellcheck, that should not have been there. At the end, Baldacci thanks a couple of excellent editors for their ""eagle eye"" and ""superb"" editing. Ha. One more instance of consumers paying for flawed merchandise; glad my copy was from the library."
2,Lightweight Reading,"Heavy on action and light on plot, I was dissapointed. I have not read Baldacci before, but expected an intelligent and appropriate mix of plot, character development and action. What I got was just repeated thundering about how ""tough"" and ""bad"" the main character was and the brand names of a dozen guns that do nothing for the actual story. Futhermore, the plot was hardly original, I picked out the primary antagonist the first time he appeared within three pages. Don't pick this one up with high expectations."
1,TV in words,"I had read Absolute Power and enjoyed it, but either I have moved on from the genre, or this book is not very good. I kept getting the sense I was reading TV scenes and dialogue, that Mr. Baldacci was writing a screenplay. I also thought the book was too long, mostly so that more scenes could be written.Just like with James Patterson, Jonathan Kellerman and others that turn out a lot of books, I think that the author suffers from too much writing and ends up relying on cliches (and there are plenty), thin plotlines and simplistic characters."
2,Disappointing,"So sorry. Usually, I love this author but this novel was a major disappointment for me. Web, the main character was boring and the book way too long."
5,Excellent Buy,"In my opinion, this is the best David Baldacci book to date. It started out with a lot of detail that I just skimmed. As I got into the book more, I found myself going back to re-read things I missed. It was like putting a puzzle together.Web London, senior member of the elite Hostage Rescue Team of the FBI, has led a very complicated and tragic life. As we explore parts of his childhood through his psychiarist, we see what led to the tragically failed mission in the very beginning and his unwitting part in it. All of this plays a pivotable role in the book and should not be skimmed.There are a lot of characters and events that seem at first (to this reader anyway) unrelated. Again, I found myself going backwards and re-reading as the full picture began to develop.This book is well worth the hard cover price. I'm sure I will re-read it several times."
2,Bad Hollywood Movie,"I'll make this review short and to the point, unlike the book. It's totally cheesy. Hollywood will most likely get a hold of this one. Don't waste your time."
5,FABULOUS THRILLER!,"For all of those who love FBI and enforcement agency books, you can't find a better one than Baldacci's LAST MAN STANDING. The main character, Web London, is truly a web of mystery even as he attempts to solve the ambush of his fellow Hostage Rescue Team members. He's the only one left -- the last man standing. He froze during the mission. His quest for the why of that leads him to a new psychiatrist. The revelations there are astounding. The mystery is tricky and wonderful. The suspense never lets up for Web, the undercover agent, Cove, and Kevin Westbrook, a street-wise kid who becomes a pawn in the deeply plotted story. The one bit of comic relief comes from Paulie Romano, a hot-head who's a lot more than he seems. This is the first David Baldacci I've read. I can't wait to read the others. His writing is wonderful, and this is a superb suspense novel."
2,A Disappointingly Weak Effort,"Having read all of Baldacci's books, I looked forward to another great read, but ended up suprisingly disappointed at this weak effort. It seems that Baldacci packed as many story lines into this one as he could possibly think of -- which were both uninteresting and unbelievable -- then expounded on them in repetitious detail (seemingly to show off how much he knows about so many things), only to have them all come together in an all-to convenient and unconvincing ending. Even more disappointing were the 2-dimentional characters and equally flat dialog. It's hard to believe that this is the same author who penned such rich characters, settings, and plots in his other novels. I only hope his future efforts return to prior form. Skip ""Last Man Standing"" and wait for the quality stories we have come to expect from Baldacci. In the meantime, try reading Vince Flynn, starting with ""Term Limits"" ... you won't be disappointed."
1,Awful...,"How I managed to finish this book is beyond me. I've read ""Split Second"" and kind of assumed that Baldacci's other works would be similar: fast-paced, enjoyable airplane read. Shame on me. This book was slow and dull.This has to be one of the longest, more painful ""thrillers"" I've ever read. My main problem with this is the scope of the book. In my opinion, Baldacci tried to take on entirely too much, too many twists, too many characters, etc. In the end I just didn't care. The characters were lifeless and stereotypical, and not a single one stuck out to me. He tried to be be a bit Clancy, with a dash of Grisham topped off with some Dan Brown, and it didnt' work.I just can't, in good conscience, allow anyone else to read this book, it was that bad. However, I have enjoyed ""Split Second"" so if I get the opportunity to read his other stuff from a library, I may take it, but never again will I have the patience that I did with this one."
1,Baldacci Has Lost The Knack,Nobody could get this book published unless he was already a best selling author. I believe this is the worst book by any multiple-published author in the past 20 years. He fulfilled is publishing contract but not he hopes of his regular readers.
2,Last Man Standing,"Having read all of Baldacci's book I was disappointed in the quality of this story. It was an unbelievable plot and insulting to the reader. Maybe the author needs to take a rest from ""thrillers"" and go back to writing books more like ""Wish You Well"""
1,Run Of the Mill,"I'll summarize the deficiencies of this book shortly. The plotting, while complex, is not believable; too many rugs are pulled out from under the reader, there are too many laughable twists at the end, and too many cartoonish villains. This last problem is one shared by the rest of Baldacci's characters: in a book centered around the protaganist's psyche, he and everyone around him seems absurd, too damaged to function, and too interested in promoting the author's own political musings on the side. The technological and organizational detail is flavorless and lengthy. Finally, the thing that killed the novel for me was the prose. Muddy, clunky, unpolished, unedited--for a specific example look at the number of times he uses the word ""however"" unnecessarily in the middle of a sentence. It was an infuriating verbal tick of his, and it just made everything else stand out that much more."
3,Disappointed Ending,I have read alot of David Baldacci's books and thoroughly enjoyed them and this was a joy to read except for the lousy ending. To me it left me hanging as to the possibility of a sequel. I think I will read another author's works for awhile and come back to reading Baldacci again.
3,Dripping with testosterone!,"This is the second Baldacci I've read. His first, Absolute Power, was an OK thriller with an intriguing plot and fairly interesting characters. This one was just too MACHO for me. We need guys like the HRT men depicted here, but I just can't stand so much posturing and shoot-em-up gunfire. The plot was decent, even cleverly convoluted -- but way beyond belief. I'll stick with Lehane, Sandford, Crais, DeMille, Burke and the like. I think they are superior writers."
3,a slow moving thriller,"I started this book with the expectation of reading a good action thriller and the first chapter proved to be just that. However the remainder of the book seemed bog down with narrative dealing with the central character's emotional problems. I also found too much emphasis on the ""machismo"" of the HRT members. The story concept was sound, but it was about 100 pages too long. The ending was too predictable and abrupt. I think the conspiracy aspect of the plot could have been better developed."
3,...makes for indifferent reading.,"Web London, with other members of the elite Charlie Team, go in to a warehouse for a mission. By the time shots have stopped, Web is The Last Man Standing.The book is spent finding out what caused the fiasco. David Baldacci has a good plot with a twist at the end, and does a nice job of describing the fraternity of Hostage and Rescue Teams (HRT).Nevertheless, the book is sunk by the incredulity of the creature called Web London. Instead of coming out as victim, he incurs the sneer of the reader, and ends up as unemotional superman.I don't know much about hynopsis, but in all candor, O Bannon's hynopsis of Web is weak. Maybe that's why it's almost lacking in detail.Last Man Standing is for those who enjoy action without contemplating the veracity of the plot. Any one else: Switch the channel."
5,SHORT AND SWEET,The best book you will ever read. From the main characterWeb London to the ending. It is the best.
1,Textbook writing.,"I've read textbooks that were more entertaining. Reading a novel is supposed to be fun. The long boring paragraphs that take up half a page would have put me to sleep if I had not given up after page 12. Am returning it to Mystery Guild in exchange for one by McBain. Now, there's my kind of writer. Last Man was my first for this writer--and my last."
1,The worst 'thriller' I've ever come across.,"Unbelievably bad. Many of the characters have laughable names, there's repetition of the plodding plot for readers too dumb to keep up, a lot of it is predictable and the writing is so bad there are exclamation marks sprinkled here and there to remind you that you should be excited. Appalling even for trash airport fiction. As another reviewer alluded, I spent time watching my bare in-flight seatback which was considerably less teeth-grinding an experience. Shame you can't rate a book with no stars."
3,Read at your own risk,"Last Man Standing is a good read as long as you are able to overlook some typical faults in Mr Baldacci's writing style. IMHO, many of his charaters are two dimensional and flat and especially so in Last Man Standing. Much of the charater interaction is also two dimensional, with so many ""hard stares"" that it should become a college drinking game.I almost quit on this book halfway through as some of the reasons why Web London froze are obvious, but I stuck with it and the pace picked up in the last third of the book."
1,ANNOYING,"This book disappointed me. Getting through it was like walking through thick, deep mud with cement shoes. Even though it had all of the ingredients to make a compelling and riveting read, Baldacci just couldn't combine them to make it so. A page turner? Yes, if you count the times I simply turned pages without reading them to finally get back to the story because he wanders off into pointless and boring details not relevent to the plot. Another annoyance in the story was how in one chapter Baldacci will relentlessly remind the reader of how the characters are macho-can-kill-with-thier-hands-studs. Then suddenly you are reading that these men of the elite Hostage Rescue Team are really so sensitive they can be brow-beaten by their wives and can't cope with the stress and violence of thier jobs."
1,Avoid this book at all costs!,"I read and enjoyed Absolute Power so when I started Last Man Standing I couldn't believe it was so bad. The characters are cartoonish, the plot is stupid beyond belief, the ending wraps up all the loose ends in a way that sounds like an A Team episode! I forced myself to finish it hoping that there would be something to it, there was'nt. I laughed out loud during the climatic sceene.This has to be one fo the worst books ever!This dog gets one star because you can't go lower"
2,Not the best of Baldaaci,The Last Man Standing is disappointing. The hero is so interested in what has happened to him and his own self-analysis is so detailed that it's hard to maintain any real interest. Baldacci's previous books were page turners. This one sat around for a long time waiting to get a page turned.
2,Story that is rather slow to unravel,"This book took about 100 pages before it really captured my interest. However, even then, there are just too many subplots and details to make this a fun read.Given the way the story unfolds, it's almost amazing that Baldacci was able to tie up almost all of the loose ends in the final 100 pages.You can tell that Baldacci is a very talented writer, but subtelty is not part of his repertoire. This story was more complex than it really needed to be."
4,Slow to Start but Worth Sticking With It,"This turned out to be one of my favorite Balducci books. It's action packed and an incredible story. There were scenes that made me laugh out loud. Love the character ""Big F."" I would say this is a ""mans"" book, but I'm a 28 year old female and really liked it.My favorite part was the ending. I felt it had a very realistic feel to it."
2,2.5 Stars maybe. Falls Apart at the End,"Okay, so you're willing to suspend your disbelief and give the central character all the tough-guy attributes coming to him in this kind of novel, but the end of the story is even hard to swallow given your aforementioned acceptance of his SuperCop status.Look elsewhere for compelling tough-cop fiction."
2,Blah,"Is David Baldacci a good writer? No. Did I finish the book? Yes. It's a badly written page turner. It's filled with SO MANY mind numbing facts (2 pages of horse trailer models, 3 pages of boring details about a horse spread and a page of irrelevant facts concerning computer ""cookies""). Neither me nor my girlfriend ever visualized the book's characters. Maybe the main character is a joker. Maybe he's akin to Tokien's Aragorn. Who knows? But... I did finish the book. I can't say that about every book. It's a page turner. The plot provides enough for the reader to keep turning the pages. But... would I recommend it? No. Suspense and Action books are ""in"" and there's enough good writers out there to spend you money on. Don't spend your money on this one."
3,Last Man Standing,"My first book by Baldacci. Overall I rate it at 3 stars. The book started off very slowly. I really didn't get interested until page 150. Too much YA YA at the begining. Once the story got going the plot twists were fun, Characters were believable and entertaining. The finally was fast paced and the book tied up the loose ends. I would read Baldacci again.(although I wouldn't put his book in front of anyone elses)"
1,Awful,"I can't say enough bad about this book. Fortunately I only paid $1.00 for it at a used book store. A silly story written to please those with execessive macho proclivities, I guess. Given that he had written Absolute Power on which the movie was based, I stuffed the urge to throw it away many times as my reading progressed, thinking I'd come to some redeeming value. I didn't. Now I'll throw it away."
2,Blah,"Is David Baldacci a good writer? No. Did I finish the book? Yes. It's a badly written page turner. It's filled with SO MANY mind numbing facts (2 pages of horse trailer models, 3 pages of boring details about a horse spread and a page of irrelevant facts concerning computer ""cookies"").

No. Suspense and Action books are ""in"" and there's enough good writers out there to spend you money on. Don't you spend your money on this one."
2,Silly,"This was my first book by the author and may well be my last. The story was so contrived and far-fetched, it was cartoonish. Baldacci is a pale [copy] of the best writers of this genre, such as Clancy."
2,Baldacci stumbles,"I have really liked all the other Baldacci books I have read, but this one didn't come close to his usual standard.-To me, the opening scene was related poorly, without clear details about the surroundings. The city wasn't named and the only description of the physical surroundings was ""refrigerators scattered about prevented vehicles from approaching the building."" This lack of detail gave the whole thing a surreal effect and a ""Mad Max"" kind of science fiction feel that took me a while to shake.-His government characters and descriptions made me feel that he was trying to be Tom Clancy instead of David Baldacci-The street language used by some characters came off completely unrealistic.-The plot is so convoluted that by the end each twist generates a weary sigh of frustration rather than a quickened pulse of excitement.Although I was far beyond caring what happened to this contrived array of characters, I did read until the end to see how this train wreck resolved itself."
2,Utterly Predictable,"Just finished this novel - my first by Balducci. The action scenes are okay but spaced very far apart. The suspense is practically nonexistent given the predictability of every move in this book. Balducci tried to throw in twists at the end which are lame and feel to have been concocted just to tie in absurd story lines. Don't bother with this one. For great mystery/detective novels, I highly recommend the earlier works by Robert Crais and Michael Connelly."
4,First Baldacci Novel,This is the first time I have read this kind of work. I got this book from a friend and I couldnt put it down. It rates right up there with Lee Child and great without the gory sex details. I will read this book again. I gave a copy to my adult son who is working his way thru school to become a police officer.
3,Last Man Standing,"Fast paced, adventure. My first time reading something written by Mr.Baldacci. I will read more."
4,Great read!,"Really fun to read, great pace and highly entertaining. The thrilling and complex story has great characters and ample twists and turns. I stayed awake for long hours to read the book and the story kept me guessing until the very end.Unfortunately I cannot say that the solution for Web London's misery is completely convincing or really believable for me. Therefore I could not rate the book with the full 5 stars.Nevertheless I really recommend to read the book - you wont regret it."
2,Mediocre and Long,"The book has a good setup. You've got a elite Hostage Rescue Team at the FBI that gets utterly wiped out in a mysterious surprise ambush and one man happened to freeze and survive. That makes two big mysteries and there are another few piled on top of it.Unfortunately the characters aren't as formed as you'd like and it makes it hard to get attached to them. In fact, almost all the male characters turn out to be your classic tough guy with a kind sensitive interior and tragic past. I found myself just waiting to find out what the next character's childhood issue would be.The book does its best to pull up a surprise ending by forcing a few disparate stories to become strangely connected.The book is okay as an action/suspense read. I was entertained throughout, but not moved or inspired in the slightest. I finished unattached to any of the characters and somewhat annoyed at the way four or so plotlines just kind of loosely fall together."
1,Unfortunately Long and Boring,"I have read all of Baldacci's books and was incredibly disappointed by this latest novel. The book was choppy, did not flow well, and was incredibly too contrived. I have never read a book where everyone was bad in one way or another and everyone had something to do with it. There are no good characters, I did not even like Web London very much. The only character I enjoyed was Romano and unfortunately we did not see enough of him. The 200 or so pages in the middle of the book were slow moving and uninspired; just filler. The scenes on the horse ranch were boring and I found that I had to force myself to finish the book, expecting some major surprise. Unfortunately, no major surprise came. The main bad guy is too predictable and you figure him out when he is first introduced."
2,Very Disappointed,"I am a great fan of Baldacci's other novels but this one is bad. It has tons of boring details, too many unloveable characters, and an ending I didn't like. It was very hard for me to finish it and when I had, I wished I hadn't bought it."
3,Suspense and twists,"The book was recommended by my mother. It's not bad, but it's not my kind of interest."
3,Really? That's it???,"After reading 300+ pages, no one enjoys a cliffhanger. And unlike his other efforts (Stone Cold comes to mind...), this Baldacci cliff ends with a whimper, not a bang. While I love the ""pulpiness"" of his writing voice, this one was a waste of $10. Sorry."
1,Nothing in this book rings remotely true,"I've been entertained by Balducci's past books, most notably The Winner, and I can accept a certain amount of fantastic plotting as well as the next person. However, the magnitude of convoluted plotting and superhuman heroics dumped on the unsuspecting reader in Last Man Standing goes over the line. The hero, an improbably named Web London, is an FBI hostage rescue expert who lives with bordeline psychosis and the ability to heal from his repeated life-threatening wounds. He is the only man to survive an ambush and drags his survivor guilt thoughout the remainder of the book like the carcass of a moose. Balducci is clearly riding on his reputation in this maddening book."
2,Last Man Reading,"After 500 pages of learning about the ultra-brave, ultra-smart, ultra-dedicated, ultra-sensitive, and ultra-caring Web London, I was actually hoping the bad guys would kill him.The author constantly needs to remind the reader that Web can kill you ten ways with a toothpick, while trying to make you feel sorry for him having a pathetic lifestyle stemming from child abuse. At least the book is a fast read. However, after 400 pages of set up, the hero solves the mystery involving about 5 different bad-guy characters in less than 10 pages. My favorite part is when Web discovers someone may have tried to kill him by finding a wound from a tack(!) on a horse's back twelve hours after the event. Give me a break!!!! You could not find a tack wound on a poodle 12 hours later. As I said, this book is a quick read, but be careful if you have a sixth grade education or higher."
1,Yuck...,"Slow, tedious, drawn-out... Might have been a good story, but poorly told. Quite a let-down from the author of Absolute Power."
1,last man standing,"my 10 year old could have written a novel that was less simplistic, unrepetetive, and more interesting than this. I wish i could send this hardback copy i have back to the author for a refund. terrible novel."
1,Total Disappointment,"Baldacci's previous works have been great reads. This one is nothing like the others. The plot and characters are just silly. I forced myself to finish the book and wondered if he was paid by the word as there is so much unnecessary ""action"".Save your money, this one is a C-."
3,Great Read,"This for me was definitely one of Baldaccis better books. Lots of edge of your seat reading, liked it so well, ordered one for my son."
2,Boring,"What a waste of time. This book is good for one thing. It reminded of something I need to work on. My stubbornness. Sometimes I can be just too stubborn for my own good. When I was reading this I just wouldn't quit and had to go all the way to the end. This will teach me. Thank you Mr. Baldacci!Here is a synopsis of the book: ""A"" is the biggest strongest man in the world. No way! ""B"" is the biggest strongest. How can they be if ""C"" was in the most awesome group of men in the world? Then they try to catch a bad guy who thinks he is the biggest, strongest and smartest of them all. Thank you again David!This would have received a 1 star except I was reminded of the lesson I needed."
5,"An excellent, concise book on flyrodding for stripers","This is a landmark book for saltwater fly fishing. I have fished with many people, including the author, and there is probably no one who has caught and released as many big striped bass as Brad Burns. He brings this knowledge to the page in a concise and no-nonsense way.A great book."
2,Does not compare to previous releases,I cannot put my finger on it but there is something different about this Crow release. It does not have the energy/emotion that her previous CDs had. I only liked a few tracks where as on her previous CDs I liked every single track.
5,Sheryl delivers once again,"Okay, so this album lacks gloss. It lacks the hype of ""Tuesday Night Music Club"" and it doesn't have the excitement of ""Sheryl Crow"". However, it makes me feel like I'm on a train journey to nowhere; I'm in no rush and am enjoying the journey for the journey's sake. As ""Subway Ride"" says: ""I'm listening to the rythm, thinking about my living."" All together, Sheryl is unafraid to say that she feels like being low-key, that she doesn't have to prove that she can be exciting. After all, the great thing about Sheryl is that we don't know what type of music to expect next. What we can expect though is an extremely enjoyable CD."
5,One word to describe it...GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Sheryl Crow's The Globe Sessions is really a great CD and worth buying if you like her previous material. Very personal and interesting lyrics and great sounds, pure rock. From the beginning to the end great music. My favorite is There Goes The Neigborhood."
5,Shery Crow just keeps getting better!!!,"I own all of Sheryl Crow's cd's. I absolutely love ALL of them!! But i do have to say that my favorite is ""the Globe Sessions."" This cd has all you want and could get out of one cd...the lyrics are just great! I couldn't and still can't stop listening to this cd! I love ""my favorite mistake,"" ""riverwide"" and ""members only"" but of course all of her songs are good! If you like any type of Sheryl Crow music ""the Globe Sessions"" is the cd to buy!!"
2,A Bonnie Raitt wannabe,"Sorry folks. I hate to be the voice of that which is negative, but the album is pretty boring and repetitive. A young friend (I'm 50) often lends me his cd's so that I can ""keep up"" with what is current. We often agree, but this one is simply ""second verse, same as the first."" Give me Bonnie anyday."
5,Sheryl huffs and puffs,"I have got her latest album and it is pretty, hel yeah, good. It's an album which takes time. The songs are more difficult to analyse. They consume more of your concentration. But after you have eaten yourself to a whole lot of self pitty from Sheryl's side that is, it's a wonderful wonderful life with her sweat voice in the background. I'm just wondering why she also used the melody of recusitation in thru the moon. GReat album buy it, why not you've got money to spend. Pardon my language"
5,"Excellent. Much better than album 1, better than album 2.","I am a 39 year old women. I wasn't thrilled with Sheryls 1st album. Her voice wasn't quite there yet. Album 2, I grew to like quite a bit, but album #3 is by far her best. Her great,strong voice,and confidence level have arrived. She speaks of relevent issues if you'd listen to the words. I was amazed that she could come up with such interesting sounds, she's never boring, and she cares. Go Sheryl Go."
5,Around The Globe,"The Globe Sessions is another strong effort from Sheryl Crow. The songs are looser and a bit harder than her second album. There is a strong country and blues influence on the album. Songs like ""Countrywide"", ""Maybe That's Something"", ""Mississippi"" and ""The Different Kind"" show off that combination. ""There Goes The Neighborhood"" is a power rocker and ""My Favorite Mistake"" has a chunky guitar riff that carries the song. ""Anything But Down"" is the best song on the album and possibly the best of her career. The album is a bit of a comedown after Sheryl Crow, but still a very strong album by an artist not afraid to take chances."
4,Sheryl Is Pretty Cool,"The Globe Sessions was a pretty good cd, but unfortunatly, the only good songs were There Goes the Neighborhood, and My Favorite Mistake. Pretty good Cd for die hard Sheryl fans, but my advice to the rest of you is get the singles!!"
4,Sheryl Crow is the best guitarist and singer,"I believe that the ""Globe Sessions"" the best at the play of Crow because the music is hypotesising. Even if she just one one Grammy that proves that she is the best at what she does. Play music. The more she give music like this a try the better she is."
3,SOLITUDE AND SADNESS..,"I must say that when I heard ""My Favorite Mistake"" on the radio, I thought, this one, was going to be, Sheryl's best album ever. But when I bought it, I was so dissapointed, there wher too many tracks that I just didn't get, or didn't click for me. ""There Goes The Neighborhood"" it's supposed to be a party song, but it's a lil' boring for my taste, ""Riverwide"" makes you wanna sleep. But let's not focus on the wrong's, the best tracks here are of course the leading single ""My Favorite Mistake"" still a fav, an a classic, so real and anthemic, ""Difficult Kind"" so intimate ad heartbreakin', ""Members Only"" a more party-fun song than There's Goes The..., over all this third delivery of Crow didn't equal the success and music of ""Tuesday"" or ""Sheryl Crow"", because it sounded boring and sad(but not a sad song that you enjoyed), here are some good tracks that you will enjoy, but the feelin' of the album could kill those great tracks, I would say half is good the other not."
5,Great CD,This CD has such of diversity of tracks from the rocky Am I Getting Through I&II to the folky Riverwide. The cover of Sweet Child O' Mine is also excelent.
4,I loved the album .,"I thought it was great, and still think it is great, but am greatly disappointed when the artist releases the album again with added tracks. Will make me think or wait to buy next time."
5,Even Better,Adding on Sweet Child o'Mine to the CD officially makes this album perfect. It was incredible before and adding this outstanding cover makes it even better.
4,The Crow with the beautiful voice,"Sheryl Crow just seems to get better and better. This album is created with country, classic rock and modern rock combined into one beautiful whole.'The Globe Sessions' can be ""used"" for a variety of things. One can listen to the album while relaxing or one can listen more focused to the nerve of the guitar and the lyrics to find the message of the album.Even though the album will gather some dust on the shelve after some time, it is still great to have around. When ever my mood is right I put on 'The Globe Sessions' and rejoice. Far the best album ever from Sheryl Crow."
5,deep and wide,"I bought Globe Sessions because I had heard ""My Favourite Mistake"" on the radio and it sounded catchy, like many of the AOR tracks I used to listen to in the 70's. But there's so much more to this record, and ""Mistake"" turns out to be one of the lesser tracks. I bought this CD in a bunch with about four others just two days ago, and although I've listened to all of them once, ""Globe Sessions"" has been in my CD player almost non-stop since then. Great album. [....]"
4,Good...Not Great,"In ""Tuesday Night Music Club"" all the lyrics were shallow, by ""Sheryl Crow"" Sheryl had added more depth with great catchy tunes. ""The Globe Sessions"" is a different view, very deep and a good album. I think it is highly deserving of the grammy it earned. I disliked the album at first but it just gets better and better. With great effects on ""There Goes the Neighborhood"" and the simple nature of ""My favorite Mistake"" it certainly is a variety worth paying for. The lyrics are deep, and very revealing of herself, and I personally believe that it is rude to just bash her when she is trying to grow as a perosn...I see this album as a bridge into her next zone."
5,Excellent!! A great mix of songs.,Every song is unique and so catchy. It's the kind of album you play over and over. Sheryl has real talent.
3,It's Okay,"This CD was Ok, I didn't like it as much as the other 2 albums cause they at least had some happy songs on them. This one is just totally depressing. The happiest song on there is Missippi."
2,the cd is listenable..,"...its not her best work, tho. And, if a woman was going to do the chick-spin on Sweet Child O Mine, it should have been Nancy Wilson with Heart drilling it. I feel physical pain with Sheryl's version (and, since she included it on this cd, its appropriate to review it)"
4,Sheryl's 3rd cool album,"This album didn't spawn many Top 20 hits like her first two albums. The biggest hit on this album is MY FAVORITE MISTAKE. I like MEMBERS ONLY because of the awesome lyrics(""All the white folks shake their asses!""). In the song,all the rich kids and politicians shake their asses also. I also like MISSISSIPPI,CRASH AND BURN and THERE GOES THE NEIGHBORHOOD."
1,i still liked her better as michael jackson's background,"all i wanna do was catchy and a couple of other tracks here and there but is this woman tone-deaf or what?that voice is horrible.what happen after doing i just can't stop loving you on stage with michael jackson on the bad tour? i see her playing guitar,bass and writing,producing etc.. she ain't no tenna marie.crow is the perfect name for her uh tone.cuz she doesn't sing she crows really bad and loud."
4,The best Sheryl Crow record,"Tuesday Night Music Club is a near disaster most of the way, her self-titled followup is coy and self-congratulatory, but The Globe Sessions is where things go right for Sheryl Crow, finally staking her claim as the pop Rickie Lee Jones for the mid-90's. ""It Don't Hurt"" and ""Anything But Down"" are propulsive breakup numbers, ""The Difficult Kind"" and ""Crash and Burn"" are gorgeous ballads, and ""My Favorite Mistake"" remains Crow's most moving and catchy single. Sheryl Crow's brand of music making is still far more marketing than art - her sad songs won't evoke emotion out of you so much as pleasant agreement - but as pop records go, this one's solid."
4,the globe sessions underrated,"I agree with all the Amazon customers who thought that editorial on the Globe Sessions was way off beam. Sheryl Crow, on that record as much as the other two records she has put out, writes songs that go from weird and funky to simple and heartfelt, and she has a great voice. Sheryl Crow is often underrated, particularly by men. All I can say is that people who diss her haven't been listening to her records properly, and have not had the pleasure of seeing her live as I have, and so have missed half the point about her. Who are these editors who think they know better than the Grammy committee, her fans, Q magazine, Rolling Stone etc.who think she is very talented?"
3,Something's missing from this one.,"Sheryl Crow is still one of the best songwriters on the scene today, and this LP still shows flashes of that. What it doesn't do, however, is take the musical chances that helped her shine on her first two albums. In fact, this seems more like the slickly-produced sound that Crow dumped in favor of ""Tuesday Night Music Club"" the first time around. There are certainly some standout tracks here: ""The Difficult Kind,"" ""My Favorite Mistake,"" ""Mississippi,"" and ""Am I Getting Through"" are good listens, but much of the rest of this album lacks the freshness of her last LP. It's good that she's not trying to repeat the same sound twice, but the sound on this album doesn't have the same staying power. Buy it if you're a big fan and/or completist."
5,"""My Favorite Mistake""touched me in a way no other song has.","I have listened to all of the songs on this CD and all of them are unique inthere own little way.my favorites are ""My Favorite Mistake"" and ""Mississippi""."" My Favorite Mistake"" has this certain sound that makes me want to listen to it all day, it's soft yet it says that she's not ashamed of what she has done in the past. That what I like about Crow she has no regrets. I hope to be the same way."
2,"Boo Hoo - No more talent left, Sheryl?","This album was a horrific waste of 13 bucks. Yeah, there was on good song on it - My Favorite Mistake, but that doesn't excuse the poor lack of any energy or excitement."
5,Absolutely loved it.,"How could critics snub this beautifully done rock album, THE GLOBE SESSIONS? I'll admit that I'm not usually into rock music, especially since I'm more into the Pop music. But I actually liked THE GLOBE SESSIONS by Sheryl Crow. My favorite songs on this CD are ""My Favorite Mistake"", ""There Goes The Neighborhood"", and ""Anything But Down"". Not only is Sheryl Crow an amazing rock artist, but she won Grammys for this CD, too! So the Grammys must like Sheryl as well as the public. My advice is to make your own opionion on music by going out and listening to THE GLOBE SESSIONS and see for yourself whether or not it is good. Don't just listen to the critics -- you can make up your own mind on what you like!"
4,This is the good stuff.,"Sheryl's third and best CD. Her songs have grown more complex and their meaning deeper over time. Sheryl fans will have much to enjoy from this CD, from the haunting ""Riverwide"" to ""Favorite Mistake"" to ""Mississippi"". Very good."
2,"Hold on to yourself, this is gonna hurt like hell!","Can we erase this CD and try again! I'm sorry Cheryl but this attempt does not live up to your standards or what I would come to expect from you. Other that a few OK songs I expected more. I am deeply disappointed with this release. But your in good company, Alanis is in the same boat. Have 2 stars faded? Must be that Year 2000 thing! Save your money buy the single, although from what I hear there won't be one."
2,Influenced or Plagerized??,"I liked Crow's previous Cd, but I can't say the same for her latest release. The first track ""My Favorite Mistake"" seems a lot like Marvin Gaye's ""I Heard it Through the Grapevine."" And the second is a Blondie rip-off. Did Sheryl Crow run out of momentum? Or was she not of her own making in the first place?"
1,"so bad I threw the CD away at the airport, but....","even though I loved the material, the bored, pretentious, grubby delivery ruined it. She needs to re-release the songs with more attention to the performance. I like her, she just must have been worn out in the studio or something.."
3,SHERYL'S SO-SO,Poor Sheryl's so-so album. I liked her self-titled album better. The only good songs on this album are My Favourite Mistake and Missisippi.The rest aren't all that great.
5,Extemely good but not quite her best.,"Sheryl Crow has made many other albums and I think this is probably the best one. I bought this CD immediately and I loved it. The song that really motivated me was ""My Favorite Mistake"" It was so good I listened to it about 20 times until I knew the words by heart. In shorter words: SMASHING!!!"
5,One of the best albums of the nineties...,"Sheryl crow is one of the best female artists of the nineties, because of her wit, and irony in her music. I thought her second album was good, but this is to this day my favorite album. I reccomend this to people who like rock (There Goes the Neighboorhood) pop (Sweet Child of Mine) and country (just about every other song ont he album) Do not think it is all country though...it is similar to the Eagles material."
5,Wicked and Fun,Inspiring and uplifting lyrics that are as enchanting as they are thoughtful...Sheryl sings with an energy and sincerity that makes it a pleasure to listen to the alblum over and over again. Every track had something special to offer. Do yourself a favor and run don't walk to the record store or even better order it right now.
2,Disappointing if you compare it to the other albums,"Sheryl Crow surprised me with her first two albums, they were groovy and had excellent lyrics. But the new album was disappointing because the songs do not have the ""freshness"" that the others had. Only two songs (My favourite mistake"" and ""The difficult kind"") are convincing. Additionally it is a lack that the booklet does not contain the lyrics any more. Sheryl Crow should add them in her - hopefully better - next album."
4,The CD is her best yet . . .,"despite what the reviewer for Amazon says. Not only is his review completely misguided, it is mean-spirited and insulting. I found most of the tracks on this CD to be just as good if not better than her two previous efforts. ""Riverwide"" is one of the most beautiful songs she has written and the track written by Bob Dylan, ""Mississippi"", seems like it was written just for her. And of course, ""My Favorite Mistake"" is defintely one of the best pop songs to come out this year. Definitely an improvement on the inane lyrics prevalent on the radio all year from 3rd Eye Blind, Matchbox 20 et. al.If you like good, old-fashioned, rock and roll, you will love this cd."
4,Crow's writing and producing skills still unparalleled.,"I agree that The Globe Sessions doesn't compare with her self-titled last album. After all, what could? It came close to being a masterpiece. But it's still a great record, and better than much of the mediocre stuff her ""contemporaries"" (Jewel, Alanis, McLachlan) have out right now. There are a couple clunkers (""Am I Getting Through"") but tracks like ""There Goes The Neighborhood"" and ""It Don't Hurt"" (with its Tom Petty-esque fadeout) more than make up for the misfires."
1,Don't believe the hype!,"This is grammy quality material? I don't think so. I got this cd because I heard two different people compare Crow's music to the Rolling Stones. I don't know what they were thinking when they made that comparison. This album doesn't rock; it is a bore with only a highlight or two. ""My Favorite Mistake"" and ""Anything But Down"" are good but not great songs. ""Mississippi"" is a really catchy song, but Sheryl Crow is no Bob Dylan. I'm just glad it was a free selection when I ordered it. I would not recommend it, and I certainly wouldn't give her a grammy for it."
1,Not what you might think.,"The album starts out with the hit ""My Favorite Mistake."" But it seems that Sheryl used up all the good stuff on the first song. The rest of the album seems to get draggy. Quite a disappointment compared to her previous work."
5,Very Entertaining,"Actually, I want to give this CD 4 and a half stars. My only complaint is rather ironic. I loved the song ""Mississippi"", but I live there, and I don't appreciated her implications that 2.8 million people are redneck no-lifes. Other than that, this CD is great! It shows that Sheryl Crow knows the true meaning of music. She did a wonderful job with ""My Favorite Mistake"" and ""There Goes the Neighborhood"". Check this CD out whenever you get the chance!"
2,Not the best from Cheryl (sorry!),"I was elated to recieve this album for Christmas, but was terribly let down at it's content; nothing on this album is as how great her other albums are !! I can't pinpoint it exactly, but this surely isn't the best CD I've bought recently."
4,Its Growing On Me,"As popular as this CD was for the general public, I had some mixed feelings about upon my first few listens. Maybe I was looking for more Rock N Roll numbers and less string arrangements and experimental touches. However, time has passed and the many of the arrangements seem creative after multiple lsitens. Sheryl puts a lot of emotion in her voice and the lyrics are indeed quite heartfelt. Whereas Crash And Burn is long and meandering its probably one of the most touching performances on the CD once you give it a chance. Riverwide has a nice guitar pattern which kind of gets you to notice it after a while. There Goes The Neighborhood has always been a favorite with the grooving beat and cool harmonies. I still prefer Sheryl's self titled release more, but this disc has many special elements that can not be ignored."
4,It must be unanimous........,"And to think I thought I'd be somewhat groundbreaking by saying this album grows on you after awhile (trust me IT DOES). It took me probably three or four monts to listen to this CD. I have alot of respect for Sheryl Crow the artist and person (that whole Wal-Mart thing). I wasn't overwhelmed by it initially but after repeated listenings to her self-titled album you want to keep hearing something from her. This a nice, mature album with great tunes like Anything But Down, Am I Getting Through and many other solid ones. This album will have a melancholy effect on you but it is a good listen. The CD won't bring you anything but down."
2,Don't buy this unless you're already a Sheryl Crow fan,"After the excellent Sheryl Crow album, The Globe Sessions is disappointing. Other than My Favourite Mistake, none of the other tracks stand out."
5,Glad to hear there's a new album coming,"This one caught me by surprise, as did the 1996 one. Crow is a powerful songwriter, and I think that her talent is underrated. She goes WAY beyond ""All I Wanna Do""."
2,"Come On People, this CD has 1-2 good songs and thats it!","This was another disappointing CD by Cheryl Crow. The first song - My favorite mistake - is one of my very favorite Crow songs, but the rest of these songs - ugh. Anyone giving this 5 stars is doing it for other reasons than song quality."
1,JUST AWFUL!,"First of all we all know sheryl crow IS NOT VERY TALENTED. You can see she tries to play the guitar but she just can't do it. Your my favorite mistake is a decent song but it does not display talent.HOW DARE SHE TRY TO COVER GUN'S N ROSES GREAT SONG ""SWEET CHILD O'MINE"". She does'nt even play an electric guiar, and there is no solo which is the best part of the song.Besides AXL ROSE SINGS EXTREMLY BETTER THAN HER.GO LISTEN TO GNR'S VERSION OF SWEET CHILD O' MINE and you will see what I am talking about!"
2,It's Sheryl with an S,"Funny how many of these diehard Crow fans can't even spell her name correctly.Radio-friendly, middle of the road roots rock for those who think that Shelby Lynne is too adventurous."
4,Sheryl Crow is a great talent,"I just wanted to say that I'm a Gun's n' Roses fan and their 1988 Appetite For Destruction CD is among the best CD's ever recorded by any artist (and, taken as a whole, a lot better than this CD). GNR's Sweet Child of Mine is an all time classic and deserved its number-one spot on the Billboard Charts, but when I first heard Crow's version a few days ago it just blew me away! Her version is better than the original! I love it. One of the few cases where a remade song is equal or better than the original. Keep up the good work, Sheryl!"
5,One of the best albums of 1999!,"What is the matter with critics? Do they have to give good reviews to artists like Britney Spears and leave out REAL talent like Sheryl Crow? This album yet again proves that Sheryl Crow still has the magic of song writing. And of course with that beautiful voice, she scores one of the best albums of 1999. This one is a must have."
3,Fails to Live Up to a Promising Start,"When you start listening to ""The Globe Sessions,"" the feeling is almost exhilarating. ""My Favorite Mistake"" and ""There Goes the Neighborhood"" are, quite simply, two of Sheryl Crow's best recordings, demonstrating her ability to channel the Stones while still sounding like the-girl-next-door.However, the album simply goes downhill from there. It's not that any of the songs are particularly bad. It's just that they all have the same guitar-strumming, pouring-out-my-heart, singer-songwriter feel with a slight rock edge. After the first two tracks, nothing else stands out, and the album becomes very tedious by the end.If Sheryl had the guts to slash this material down to about 35 minutes, she might have had a great album. As it is, however, it's just too much of the same thing."
5,Fantastic 5.1 mix/ sound,"I am not a huge Crow fan, but this disc is an exception to my collection. The songs are all very well written...some have not received the attention they are due. I love playing this through my DVD-Audio player for the crisp playback. This is the version to get. Well done all around!"
3,Wrong Picture,The shipped item was Netami brand from American Auto. This brand has low light as compared to the one which is shown in the picture.I returned all the ordered items.
2,Good performance. Bad DVD.,"I remember buying the CD for this show as well as the VHS, back in the late 80's. While it was a great concert then, it seems very outdated today. I would've nonetheless given this DVD a 5/5 hadn't it been for the terrible digital transfer from Grandstand Entertainment.It looks like it was transfered from a second generation source and, to make things worse, the show itself has been compressed to half the total capacity of a single layer DVD. It's overly soft and grainy and the sound is far from enjoyable, as well. I've transfered older VHS tapes to DVD that looked and sounded better than this release! It's no wonder Grandstand Entertainment has since gone out of business...I'll stick to listening to the CD, until a better DVD edition comes along."
4,"Great concert, too bad it's not HD","I watched this concert on HBO long time ago and loved it. I tried to buy it recently, but the price was prohibitive, and it was a VHS rip converted to DVD. I welcomed this DVD release and grabbed a copy. Still the same great concert, and still VHS low-speed quality. It was probably shot that way originally."
2,Bad Video,"First I love this concert! I have it on VHS and it is on of my favorites. I bought the DVD expecting normal DVD video quality. The concert was certainly duped from VHS without any remastering. The picture quality is actually worse than VHS. I will however, purchase Carly's concert again if it is ever released on Blue ray"
2,Voice Track Redone,"My wife LOVES Carly Simon, and especially the Vineyard Concert from some 20 years ago. I taped this concert live off of HBO when it was aired originally, and we have almost worn the VHS tape out, playing it dozens of times. I bought this VHS tape as a backup, figuring my original would wear out sooner or later.Well, it's the same... almost.Any buyer should beware that the entire lead vocal track has been redone. To some, this may be an improvement; after all, the lead vocals are now absolutely perfect. But I like the energy from the original, and knowing that my tape was exactly how she sounded THAT NIGHT. And she sounded terrific - it really wasn't necessary to re-do the vocals. It kind of reduces the show to a lip-synching exercise. Maybe that makes me a purist. But a concert should stay a concert, in my opinion, with the original live vocals."
5,A Haunting Performance That Lingers in Your Memory,"Carly Simon is in her element here... literally. Shot entirely on a pier located by the water on the Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard, this is a mesmerizing concert in a gorgeous setting. The wind blows and the sun shines as a small, appreciative audience listens to familiar hits, like, ""You're So Vain"", and lesser known gems like, ""It Happens Every Day""... a bittersweet tune that is sure to resonate with anyone who has ever been divorced or lost someone they once loved. It's hard to believe this wonderful performance is not available on DVD, especially since VHS copies are sold out. Find one, wherever you can, and enjoy it over and over again."
4,One of Carly's best public performances,"Carly Simon is a very talented song writer and an underrated performer. I loved the children participating in ""Coming Around Again / Itsy Bitsy Spider""! Some of her children were a part of the group."
4,Good stuff.,"I forget all the songs that she did. Great band, great arrangements. I was fun getting a copy of some of the music from that part of my life."
5,Hope all the copies are not glitched...because it's GREAT,"We have been waiting for this to come out in DVD for years. We saw the orignal on TV, have pretty much worn out our VHS tape of it and now have the DVD. It's great, but....the 2nd song has huge audio/video breakup and several other songs have slight glitches or sound fading. Amazon is sending me a replacement and I sure hope these problems are limited to the first copy I received, but I've never heard of Grandstand Entertainment."
5,Fantastic,"Ive been after this DVD for years, and to say I couldn't be happier is an understatement. The delivery was very fast, estimated date of delivery was beginning of march, yet it arrived in the middle of feb. It was packaged brilliantly and would definitely buy from this seller again.I was concerned that with it coming from America that it wouldn't play on my DVD player due to different regions but that concern was unjustified and it played fine."
3,"Not as good as I thought it would be, just not enough hits on a hit album.","Not as good as I thought it would be, just not enough hits on a hit album. I ordered the one we lost, Carly on the QM2, but even it is missing two of my favorite songs."
3,"great show, worth buying","The video is pretty good, at least it doesn't jump around from camera to camera every 2 seconds. The audio is high quality, and it is obviously ""enhanced"", at least on the vocals, some. Nonetheless, since it is the only video of Carly, it is still worth having. Additionally, I have to add that they did not do a number of her hits -what a shame. The songs they did were very good."
5,Wonderful Elephant Collector's Book - Nothing like it,"Wonderful Encyclopedia of Elephant Collectibles!I have finally found a book exclusively for elephant collectibles This one is FANTASTIC! Over 1000 color images in 140 categories! I no longer have to wade through scrores of books to find one or two elephant collectibles I have. Virtually all the elephants have the basic information I am looking for (maker, size, value etc.) and many have much more. The index and resources sections are chock full of places, makers and artists so you canto find out more info. I understand Volume 2 is underway and I cannot wait for it."
3,Drum solo with difference,I would give this DVD 5 stars if music CD would be in the package. I live outside US and for me it is almost impossible to purchase the music for this choreography. If for some reason it is not legal to have a music CD for the choreography in the same package then music should be available for purchase from the same source as DVD. Otherwise the whole choreography DVD concept is useless. I can learn it but can't perform it.
3,"Interesting Examples, but falls short in editing","This book has helped to change the way I analyze language. It is a very interesting read due to the varied examples and well-reasoned analyses. The author's tone gets annoying at times, but it is tolerable. I am perplexed by the book's constant errors of grammar. There is one glaring mistake on nearly every page. It greatly reduces the readability of this title. I would still recommend the book to anyone who wants to more accurately tell fact from fiction and truth from lies, but you'll be very frustrated with all the mistakes along the way."
2,a little caution needed,"One of the most confusing things about logic and reason is that it all necessarily depends on what you mean by the words you use, which is to say... it all depends. I note for example, in the introductory chaper, page 1, ""Overgeneralization"", there are a couple major overgeneralizations. That's why they needed to invent math and science, where nothing is real except precise definitions, and logic works wonderfully. Using reason with actual real things takes more than logic."
4,Probably should read this first.,Another book I Ordered and I never got around to reading. Scanned it And it looked pretty.
5,"Stunning, Joyful, Tasteful Live Gene Harris Session","This is Gene Harris at his best. Gene Harris, who i consider the king of ""happy blues"", pounds out some luscious melodies and swingin rhythms. Here he is with the late great Stanley Turrentine, and the two are on the same page. The rhythm section is also really swingin with Ray Brown anchoring on bass. A highlight is Battle Hymn of the Republic done as a gospel blues. The music overall is very happy, but on some tracks like Misty, Gene spins out some wonderfully evocative balladry. Overall, this is a great live recording, and you can wail along right with the audience, because they really captured the mood. A must-have for any Gene fan or jazz / blues enthusiast."
5,Wonderful CD,"Gene Harris is one of my favorite anyway, but if you love jazz piano, this Cd is great listening. Probably one of his best!"
1,Poor construction with cloth that is too thin,"This garment is poorly sewn with cloth which was too thin to provide some very necessary functions for men. If you just want underwear look on; however, if your aim is to obtain a bedroom brief you can do better for less. At is unless the view is everything"
1,Waste of money.,"These charcoal incense cones do not stay lit. They burn for about one minute, then go out every time. I even tried putting lighter fluid on them (carefully) and once the fluid burned off, the cones still quickly stopped burning."
5,turbo Jam,"This video is really good. The exercises are awesome and have different types of exercise you can do during the day. It is not boring at all the music is really good and you will see results if you do it often. It is worth it. In addition, the instructions are really clear and easy to follow."
4,"Fun, Not just another aerobics dvd","Haven't used a workout video in many years. I always found them so boring...doing the same move over and over , then doing another move over and over. With power Jam you are exercizing all the right muscles over and over again but in different ways. Charlaine really mixes it up so the ""repetitive"" squats just sneak in and you are done before you know it. You won't even find yourself doing the same mundane pre and post workout stretches (I think I appreciate that most of all). The 40 minute cardio and 40 minute sculpt workouts are great, and the shorter 20 minute cardio is wonderful for those days where time has slipped away. However, I think with any exercise program, you will get bored with ANY workout video if it is your only source of exercise everyday. I would recommend trying to buy used, they are usually in great shape, and then you don't feel so put out if you don't like it."
4,great!,This is a great workout and a lot of fun! YOu do a lot punching and sometimes I wish there was a little more kicking but other than that I think it is great!
5,GREAT WORKOUT,"This workout is great, if you have the patience to learn the steps, because they change fast from one to another. But I really enjoy the program because it is very fun."
4,Turbo Jam Workout,Good workout that does not seem like work. Having fun and getting results. Not bad at all.
2,Good workout but not enough intensity,"I'll agree with many reviewers, this is a fun workout.However, I was a little disappointed because I was hoping for much greater intensity, keeping that in mind...if you are some one who has a normal gym schedule, do other videos like Taebo or the Firm,thanthis workout won't do much for you."
4,"Great video, but not a genuine copy","This is my first time doing Turbo Jam, and I loved it. It was fun, and I would consider buying other workouts by Chalene. I would consider myself an intermediate exerciser. The order was not from Amazon directly, and the video was clearly a copy (Windows read the disk as jibberish instead of its name, the cover was a color photocopy and not professionally printed). If you care about such things and don't want an illegal copy, buy directly from Beachbody."
3,Turbo Jam,I think this is a great workout DVD but for someone older than 40 it isn't quite fitting..
3,The best workout is scratched.,"The DVD took a while to come and then when it got here I realized that the longest workout, the main reason I bought it, is scratched. How disappointing. :("
2,Turbo Stupid,"What a waste of money the moves are so stupid, I am sorry I watsted my money!!! This workout is only good for starters but not for someone that has been working out like myself, if your fit like me save your money you will be bored as hell, the moves are not challenging at all."
4,pretty good,"I really like one of the cardio workouts on this DVD. The lady that leads the workouts has a lot of energy that keeps me going. It is a fun workout. I've done the workout several times and am seeing some results. However, on one of the DVDs, the workouts freeze up which is pretty annoying. Sometimes it even starts the workout over from the beginning. The other DVD is fine though. Overall I really like the one cardio workout on the DVD that does work so it was worth the money to me."
5,Fitness Made Fun!,"I can not tell you how much I enjoy this video series. I purchased this set when it first came out in 2005, I had just had my first child and was NOT happy with the body it left me with. Chalene helped me get up off the couch and get motivated to make a change. I like how she gets you to learn a routine by building on the moves you did one step at a time and then switches to the other side. I never felt like I was lost or not picking up the sequences. I look forward to my time with Turbo Jam, even six years and another child later. Although I enjoy the cardio party very much, nothing gives me that satisfying burn like Turbo Sculpt. So 100lbs later (50 per child), I can say that this workout series is fun and motivational and you will lose weight and enjoy every second of it!"
5,Great Investment!,"I've been trying a lot of workout videos from BeachBody, because I like to have a variety to choose from. I've done these workouts several times already, and feel I can't get bored of it! You can always improve, or put more energy into it. It's comparable to the other BeachBody workouts, high energy, great instructor, lots of options of types of workouts!"
4,nice at home work out,"I bought this product while I was at home on maternity leave, it was a refreshing break to have a good workout at home. I broke a sweat a few times, and seemed to get a pretty good cardio workout. I really didnt notice any immediate results, maybe I wasn't tucking my butt under correctly, or squeezing my abs tightly enough? I joined a gym shortly after I purchased these and haven't used them since. However at the time I enjoyed them a lot. At a discounted price, this is a good buy if you need something to get your heart rate up-and if you are short on cash, or short on time."
2,Good workout if you can put up with the OBNOXIOUSNESS,"I like this workout a lot, but you have to put up with a lot. The music is horrible. The back-up dancers are so obnoxious. They all make googly-eyed faces at the camera and do their own version of the workout (making it distracting) - Mindy, old lady, and chubby girl (three of the dancers) - I'm looking at you! Also, I'm not really interested in close-ups of Chalene's boobs the whole time (yikes!). Lastly, I have done Brazil Butt Lift (I LOVE) and P90x and have to say thta Chalene's que-ing is AWFUL."
3,turbo jam,I was surprised that the dvd's didn't come in any kind of jacket. i haven't used them yet. Hopefully they work.
5,Greatest Workout EVER,"Turbo Jam is AMAZING. I am so glad that I purchased this workout. I have fun while burning calories. If you want to workout without feeling like you're forcing yourself and getting bored, Turbo Jam should be your choice. A+++++"
5,Best workout ever!,"This is by far the best purchase I've made in a very long time! I saw the informercial on tv and was curious about it... At $10 on Amazon, I thought I'd give it a try. Never regretted it! I do one workout a day and, while keeping the same diet, lost 15 pounds in 3 months. Would recommend it to anybody who's trying to get fit and/or lose weight!"
5,This is FUN!!,"I have done Tae bo in the past. I've also taken karate and kickboxing. I was a little skeptical thinking this was going to be the same as what I've already tried and gotten bored with, but it's not.Chalene is so darn happy and having fun in these videos, I just can't help but want to join in her enthusiasm! It is a great way to start my day!I've only had the videos for a few days and have only tried the 20-minute and the ab workout so far. I'm not new to exercise, but holy cow is my core SORE from the ab workout!! I'm so excited about that!!!The bottom line, I am happy I added this to my workout library!"
3,"good workouts, faulty dvd","One of the dvds skips and freezes during one of the workouts. I contacted the seller to let them know about the problem, but never got a response."
3,At least I am moving around.,"It's not as earth-shattering as some others have made it out to be, but with Turbo Jam, I am at least DOING the 20-minute workout almost every day (as opposed to other DVD's I have tried that lay unused and dusty on my bookshelf). I can make the commitment because it's pretty fun, easy to follow, and not too grating on the nerves. I had already lost a bunch of weight before I started doing T.J., and now am trying to tone up a bit. I realize that is not an overnight matter, so the verdict is still out on the overall efficacy of this program. My goal was to get off my butt, and in that regard, Turbo Jams works."
1,Not completely Happy,I bought Turbo Jam to workout at home when I can not make it to the gym. Just when I get use to following one person to do the exercises the camera bounces around. Especially for finally. IT is so frustrating when you are trying to learn the move. I went back to working out with my Biggest Loser Cardio Max DVD.
4,Great Workout,I absolutely love this workout. It is upbeat and has great music that makes you want to do the workout over and over. It really does work
4,great video,I love this DVD. I use to take Cardio Kickboxing at a local gym. We just moved and I no longer have access to these classes. This is the next best thing for me to do a similar workout at home. The workouts are very similar and I feel like it is a great workout.
1,Turbo Jam Workout DVD,"I ordered this workout DVD because I enjoy all Beachbody products/workout DVD's. I chose to order a new DVD rather than a used one. The workout included 2 DVD's. However, both DVD's did not play well. It started skipping about 10 minutes into the workout. I could not finish. I am very disappointed in this purchase. I plan on returning it to Amazon."
1,"Bad DVD, Skips, stops and bluury sequences, Super bad quality.","Bad quality DVD.Couldn't use it because it kept on stopping in middle of program. All that stuff a bad quality DVD does. It is obviously a copy because the DVd is so bad. I have seen an original Turbo Jam DVD from a friend who got it from the main distributor , [...] and it was perfect. Even cover was in brighter colors.This has been copied and I should get my money back but I can't be bothered."
3,Obnoxious,"Turbo Jam may work, but I just really couldn't stand Chalene Johnson! She is just obnoxious! I hated the music even though that is one of the special selling features. It is high gear, but I got bored with it very quickly. Try Billy Bank Tae bo Cardio Jam - it's excellent!"
3,Its just for beginners,"I was not that impressed, I thought it was very slow pace, it appears to be a very long warm up, only time I thought it was great was the less than a minute TURBO when she finally was ready to get your heart rate up, then it was over at a blink of an eye, I believe the part where she decides to increase your heart rate to TURBO should have been at least 4-5 mins long or more and with that the intensity, would have been great and more calories will get burned. Its a good workout for beginners, but not for the advance person. I believe that`s a good way for her to sell another video for people like me who needs more......"
2,Work out,"I was looking forward to this ""turbo"" workout...however, the second CD was distorted and very low audio. She really didn't move me with the workout but was very upbeat. I didn't return it because I don't work out to the same thing all the time so by the time I decided to check out the second CD, it was too late to send it back. So I had to keep it."
1,I'll stick with tae bo,"I don't know why these beachbody workouts get such good reviews. I would be really mad if I had paid full price for this. I bought mine used. This is some kind of spazzed out rip-off of tae bo without the talent, proper form, or professional quality. She keeps talking about how great the music is, but you can't hear it and she never shuts up anyway.I wear a heart rate monitor and I burn more calories with less annoyance with a Leslie Sansone 2 mile walk! I'll stick with Tae Bo for this type of workout. Like the other beachbody workouts you are paying way too much for a lot of filler and very little substance."
2,Hard to follow,"I was into this dvd less than five minutes and had to turn it off. What a waste of money for me personally. I had a difficult time with the routines in general because she was going to fast, but also because if you aren't familiar with the moves and proper form how are you supposed to go from one move to the next? I also thought it was really cheesy and didn't feel like it was a serious video for me. I guess looking at the commercials on it, it looks fun, but there really is no instruction and you have to take time to get the moves down to really do the workout with everyone on the screen."
4,it is awesome...,"I have never had any formal exercise regimen before (nor done any reviews)but feel compelled to write this review. have had it for a week, i do feel the sculpting going on...as chalene says..it is what you put into it that makes the difference...so if you put more effort, you will definitely see the results"
5,Pleasantly Surprised.,"I'm not sure what got me into Turbo Jam initially, but I am thankful for whatever it was, ever since then I've been hooked. Admittedly, it does take a few times to catch onto the chorography, and it can be hard on your knees, but that aside, it's a challenging and fun workout.Just after doing it for a few weeks, I can see and feel the changes already. I would highly recommend this product."
2,A little much...,"I love Hip Hop Abs, thought I would like this too... The instruction isn't that great and it's slightly hard to catch on to... Wouldn't necessarily recommend it."
5,Highly recommended!,"I was tired and not motivated with the boring workouts. Tired of the crunches on the floor, who were actually hurting my back!I wanted a good way to work out inside (when I couldn't go running), a fun way, and Turbo Jam didn't disapoint me!!Charlene is fun, motivated, sincere, and what I like the best is that you never have to touch the floor doing crunches.The workouts are flying by, and I am having so much fun, that it is always easy to do it again and again! :)"
2,Too complex for me,"The moves were just so consistent and fast I gave up after rewinding so much just to learn a move. I'm sure it does burn calories and fat, because the dance exercises just keep on going. I enjoyed it...just too much going on."
5,Turbo Jam Beachbody 5 Workout,"I have the Cardio Party and Ab Jam workout DVD already and like it so much, I decided to give one like it (Beachbody 5) to my sister since she's trying to drop some weight...She loves it and is dropping lbs!"
2,Not my cup of tea,"I couldn't keep up with the dance moves, and so did not get a very good workout. I barely worked up a sweat. I don't really understand how it would burn calories. I switched to Jilliam Michael's ""Burn Fat, Boost Metabolism,"" and I like it much better. I work up a sweat and really exercise. I suppose that's because it has simple moves, like jumping jacks. I have absolutely no talent when it comes to dance moves. As others have mentioned, I think her cuing in Turbo Jam is not very good. I never knew when she was going to do the next move."
3,It got old to me quick!,"The first 3 workouts were cool but after that this game got old really fast. It would probably be better for an older person that is trying to stay active but for someone like me trying to go the distance, it was a little boring."
4,If Only I Had Discovered Turbo Jam First!!!!,"I do Taebo and I absolutely love Billy Blanks! That is the reason that I'm torn between Taebo and Turbo Jam. Both Taebo and Turbo Jam are great workouts, but it depends on what style you are looking for. If you are more spontaneous, love to dance, and catch on quick to choreography, then I'd go with Turbo Jam. If you are more of a straight forward, bar none, two left footer person then I'd recommend Taebo! If you are like me and you fit both categories, then alternate between the two. But Billy has my heart so I'm sticking with him as my main guy! Love Turbo Jam, but the cueing on the 20 minute and 45 minute workout could IMPROVE!Overall rating: 4.5"
5,Love it!,"I absolutely love these Turbo Jam workouts. I lost 10 lbs over the past few weeks as I started doing the Cardio Party work-out (50 minutes) and the Turbo Sculpt (strength training, 40 minutes) about 5 days a week. I needed to ""jumpstart"" my weight loss plan as I had my 3rd child 8 months ago and had reached a plateau for a few weeks. When I started Turbo Jam, I quickly lost the weight and started to gain a little muscle. I could have lost more over the past few weeks, but I didn't follow the eating plan and cheated a few times. However, I'm still happy because I'm not stuck at that plateau number. The Turbo Jam workouts are high energy, FUN (with a bubbly instructor, Chalene Johnson) and has a great music selection. These qualities make me want to workout on a daily basis."
4,Turbo jam,"I was happy with the speed at which I received my purchase. However, it does not have the booklet that comes with the original DVD."
4,Have taken the classes at the gym,"I haven't bought this product yet, but I spent over a year taking Turbo Kick Box classes at my gym. For me, it's the perfect workout. I cannot workout on my own on machines, I just don't feel like I'm hitting all the zones, but in the TKB class, I definitely feel the difference between cardio, strength, endurance, etc. After taking my mother to a class, I can see how some find the workout daunting due to the choreography, but if you have any semblance of being able to mimic motions, you should be able to catch on after a few tries. I now live in a new area and it seems like none of the gyms teach turbo kick, so now I am left with the decision to buy or not to buy...but after the weight loss success I had with this class at the gym, it's worth a 35-dollar shot"
2,Dissapointed!,"I got this DVD because of the high rated on the reviews, but I found it silly and boring, and I wonder if you really work out your abdominals. I feel like I waste my money:(."
1,Highly overrated,"Not sure why this gets such high marks from reviewers. The music is annoying, Chalene is annoying, the other exercisers are super-annoying, and the moves are repetitive and boring. I did stick with this for 4 weeks and have seen no results other than being out of the money it cost and losing motivation due to said lack of results"
1,"dont waste your money, use insanity instead","I BARELY broke a sweat in this video. The moves are confusing, repetitive, and lack impact. Unless you enjoy bobbing around and shadow boxing for 30 mintues, I would only recommend this workout to people who like to dance and have only started their fitness journey. Then again some of the moves actually look dangerous for the joints. Glad i didnt spend money on this. If you are in decent cardio shape, use insanity instead. I dropped 12 pounds in 2 months using insanity. I am disappointed in this workout. I was really excited that a woman was coaching a HIIT workout, but this has nothing on insanity. Really, this is the lamest workout ever. Im not sure why there are so many good reviews.I seriously doubt that you would see any noticeable results with this."
5,"Fun, works!","The work outs are fun. Chalean is high energy. Music is good. I have seen results in two weeks using these workouts everyday with one day off a week, with out changing my dietary intake. It took me two tries to completely finish the Cardio Party, the third time I just realized that I am still a beginner and I had to take it down a notch. I recommend this!"
3,good work out,"The dvd came fast, there were 2 dvds in it and one of them skipping a lot. My husband and I love the work out."
1,How big are they?,"You'd think that the sizes of Small to Extra Large might be a good description of these cases. You know, I just may buy one if I knew how large the large one is."
1,demented,"I'm researching behavior , my thoughts on this film are that, one ,with impressionable youth it is more likely to create a predator then support a lesson or moral to the story , two ,aggression against women is fostered by sexual desire that is stimulaed by violence either for them or against them , in my estimation this film appeals to the darker side of man and should not be seen by man or beast for the former will become the latter more than likely after seeing it ."
2,Creepy And Sad,"This movie shows a brother and sister forced to have sex with each other at gunpoint. Not only are they depressed and confused after it's over, but life as they knew it will be more or less over. Nothing will ever be quite normal again. It makes you wonder what unspeakable experiences other people are silently carrying on their backs. If I could go back in time, I would skip this movie, even though it's thoughtfully and sensitively told."
1,not worth the time or effort,this is a real snoozer...that uses film angling and music to fill its space...a wicked subject matter which is poorly explained...and then even harder to believe is how fast the brother goes off the deep end and wants to do it again....
2,Clumsy,"This movie,stated as based on true events, is more like a Telemovie with little budget.Viewing it for the first time, without knowing the actual motive for the kidnapping and crime, one is left wondering for most of the duration just why did it happen and what is going to be the outcome.The after events seem almost not in keeping with what has happened.You would expect that at least the police and parents would be involved, but no, just an awkward complication regarding a future marriage and another seemingly strange out of character event.The notes at the end of the movie finally suggest what the motive was and this is an important issue, but this movie needed a much better script and director to let it have impact."
4,Minor Rodgers and Hammerstein - Major show,"This (sadly) remains out of print, but judging from the CD itself it was a better show than either Allegro, or Pipe Dream, R&H;'s other two (comparative) failures.There is plenty of great Rodgers music, and the Hammerstein lyrics are witty and literate. Given this, there are really only a couple of songs that set you humming, but ... if we had heard them as often as we have heard the songs from (say) South Pacific, who knows how they would sound?It seems the play itself was the main weakness that kept it from being a major hit, but apparently it paid its quite considerable expenses, and turned a small profit - and I don't think you can call any show that does that a true ""flop""."
5,greaatttt...,my mom loves this footwear..its very comfortable and she could use as a formal or an informal wear..it looks great and is very sturdy..
4,Nicely padded but a bit narrow,"These sandals are designed for comfort, with nicely padded straps to prevent them from chewing into your feet. I wouldn't recommend them for those with wide feet though, they're quite snug on my medium width feet."
5,Great sandal,I love this casual sandal. It has great support in the arch. Very comfortable and looks great too!
5,So comfortable!,I love these sandals...they are very comfortable and lightweight. I tend to wear a lot of casual clothes and the shoes go with everything! It's worth the price.
4,"timeless advice on the process, dated on the details","I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because of the amount you can skip about things like ""Whether or not to use a computer.""This book is fabulous though, and having received my PhD a week ago, I can say it was immensely helpful - especially when my advisor turned into a monster as if from nowhere.You will read almost all you need to know about the types of advisors, finding and working with committee members, and (perhaps most importantly) the dissertation myths and anxieties that paralyze us all from time to time.I have read several of these ""How to write a dissertation"" guides, and this was the one I came back to again and again."
4,"Definitely a "" must-have"" if you are writing your thesis","Even though this book was published in 1981, it still has great relevance to the dissertation writer. Specifically, it adresses the demons that face the writer and the politics of dissertation writing that no one ever tells you about when you begin the process. The insight about selecting an advisor, a committee and a topic is very valuable. The section on post-dissertation let down and moving forward is also useful. This book helps the dissertation writer understand that it can be done. Sometimes in this process, that is all you will need."
2,"Worth skimming, but not owning.","The author wrote this in the 80's when the future of academia was looking a little bleak so I can forgive him some of his pessimism, but the book is rather dreary and has the principal effect of scaring away those considering a doctoral program (which is perhaps a good thing). The book has three critical flaws: it's 100 pages too long, it's dated (especially the material on computers and sexual harassment), and the author has the annoying belief that social science dissertations are the only ""full"" dissertations. By suggesting that his own field of Sociology is the most difficult field of study, the author alienates many potential readers and loses any claim of impartial observation. All of the useful gems of advice are covered in a shorter and more optimistic book written by Evelyn Hunt Ogden on the same subject. Read that one instead."
4,Does anyone else feel this way!,"Sternberg's book is, at times, dated, however he does tap into the hard-to-explain feelings of anxiety facing the ABD. This text has been a sort of therapy for me as I complete my course work and ready myself for the lonely adventure of data collecting, analyzing and writing. Chapter 7 provides meaningful guidelines for organizing your own dissertation-support group."
3,How to Complete and Survive a Doctoral Dissertation,THis book is not really worth purchasing for the doctoral student. It is not helpful in preparing the dissertation.
2,This book needs a major update!,"I can't imagine anyone ever completing their dissertation if it is as truly awful as he describes! While I am sure the information about dealing with stress and depression are valuable, what I wanted at this point was something to help me get going, not shrink back in anxiety.The author talks about the importance of a good typist and going to computer centers where someone else runs your data. He also talks about how he hand tabulated the data. I wonder if his time estimates are accurate given Word, SPSS, Excel and the Web. (It might be that time is the same, but that expectations are now higher...)I finished this book feeling that I had the choice of my husband and son or a dissertation. Luckily I talked with other ABD's who managed to cheer me up."
5,Awesome!!!,"My son loves the shirt. He wears it all the time. He says ""it goes with his board""Thank you,Heather and Jake (age 10 3/4) Strong"
4,"JOHN HUSTON, OPUS 29",Kris Kristofferson's Help Me Make It Through The Night perfectly illustrates the despair of most of Fat City's characters. I liked a lot the first and the last scene of the film that say the same thing : Stacy Keach is getting nowhere no matter how hard he tries. Highly recommended.
5,Fat City,"In ""City,"" a return to form for Huston, the director presents a spare, bleak portrait of humanity on the skids in the world of small-town boxing. Not easy or pleasant to watch, the film's impact sneaks up on you, as Huston's spot-on evocation of this down-and-out world eventually creeps under your skin. The acting bar is set high, with Keach believably tragic in the central role, and Tyrrell stealing the picture (and nabbing an Oscar nod) as the bitter, broken down Oma. Though by Hollywood standards a ""small picture,"" ""Fat City"" still scores a knock-out."
1,Boring...,"I know that this film is supposed to be a masterpiece, but I fail to see how anyone can interpret this film that way. I was surprised to see Jeff Bridges is such a boring film. I found that this film wandered too much in the beginning. I watched the first hour and noted that there was hardly any character or plot development! I found that the movie never really amounted to anything. I believe that this movie is not even worth renting! If someone can explain to me how they could interpret this movie as an excellent one, please feel free to e-mail me with an explaination, otherwise, my feelings towards this movie will stay the same. Addy : joekerrthejoker@hotmail.com"
3,loosely strung theme,"First, this book can be read in two sittings. With that in my mind, most of its flaws can be forgiven. Chief among these is the fact that the book is essentially a collection of anecdotes and stray stories, rather than a straightforward historical narrative or discussion. The end result is not very gratifying and only slightly edifying. (The most interesting factoid: De Beer's marketing suggestion that one spend 2 months' salary on an engagement ring, is 1 month in Europe and 3 months in Japan.) Some minor, but frustrating factual inconsistencies, e.g., the # of grades into which De Beers sorts its diamonds, as well as some sloppy editing.It's funny that the book's cover includes a blurb from Susan Orlean, author of The Orchid Thief. She pulls off this style of complex storytelling much more effectively and with a much clearer thesis that runs consistently throughout."
4,"""...as if a curtain had been ripped aside and there was the diamond business, spattered with blood, sorting through the goods.""","p.187This book made me glad that my wife and I twenty years ago decided to get neither the traditional diamond engagment nor wedding rings. I gave her a nice strand of pearls (probably another book out there) and we exchanged diamondless rings when we wed.Chapter 9: Diamond Wars was horrifying in the sheer numbers of dead and maimed. Whenever teenage boys are fed drugs to go and slaughter civilians, there's more to it than idealogy, it's fed by sheer corporate earnings.Recommended further updated reading: the reports on [...] account how the Kimberley Process, designed to eradicate the conflict diamonds, has in part been used to legitimize them."
2,I'm disappointed by this book,"I'm disappointed by this book. I expected a history of power, influence, and science relating to diamonds, or perhaps an expose on a ruthless and unethical industry. Instead, it reads like a collection of stories from diamond insiders, the kind of stories they would tell to bored outsiders during after-dinner drinks in the parlor.The description on the back cover begins ""For centuries, diamonds have symbolized wealth, prestige, and love. But behind those symols lies a world of deceit, monopoly, and war..."" But the book handles the substantive topics with kid gloves. It completely ignoring essential historic events like colonial abuses in Africa and King Leopold. You do get agonizingly detailed accounts of how exciting it is to discover a new diamond mine."
5,An appealing title on many levels,"Matthew Hart's Diamond is an appealing title on many levels, blending geology with a survey of the science and history of the diamond. Hart follows the 'diamond trail' around the world, from a great diamond cutter's works to smugglers and businesspeople. An unusual guide to the heart of an obsession."
3,"Hart's ""Diamond"" a good read, except for one thing...","Matthew Hart's ""Diamond"" provided an interesting and entertaining glimpse into the world of the diamond trade. Rather than giving a detailed treatment of the geology of diamonds and the history the diamond business, the author covers these in broad strokes, while highlighting key people and events that have shaped the diamond industry worldwide. More attention is given to recent events (nineties through to present), especially the diamond discoveries in the Canadian Arctic. Overall, it is a very readable book. However, I was quite disappointed by the utter lack of even a passing mention of man-made diamonds. I know there is an interesting story behind the development of the technology for making synthetic diamonds, and the impact they have had on the diamond industry."
5,Terrific Story of Power and Greed!,"This book is an excellent historical and geological overview of the mystique surrounding diamonds and the lengths people will go to obtain them. The author takes you from the deserts of Africa to the jungles of South America in a page-turning whirlwind that's hard to put down. The book is both entertaining and educational, containing several interesting photographs, maps and charts."
4,Interesting Gem,"I thoroughly enjoyed the read. A good over view of the orgin, history, exploration, marketing, and commodity of the diamond market, without the dry technical jargon. I was completely facinated by the gamble one takes by purchasing large stones in the rough, and the tedicious craftsmanship that goes into cutting and polishing a beautiful diamond. I loved the history and discussion on famous diamonds and their journey though the hands of royality, soliders, religous conflicts, and theifs. Made you stop and think, what are diamonds really worth? I would of enjoyed color photos thou!!!!!"
4,A great scope into an unimagined world of the diamond trade,"This book is a great page-turner. It simplicity and great structure make a good reading. It is a window into the world of the diamond trade. The author takes us from Brazil, to Antwerp, to New York. to London, and finally to India. In search for wolth a new world is unveiled. A trade that causes wars and famine. As the author states it, an obsetion."
3,Hmmm....,"Not really a ""remaster"" as much as it is a needle drop cleaned up in pro tools or sound forge or whatever.Your are better off looking for ""Archie's Party"" on RKO Records. It is EXACTLY the same as Jingle Jangle, all originalRon Dante etc, but sounds much better. Love the songs but could have done a better job and not killed the fidelity."
5,Wish I'd been there!,"This is a recording of a concert given by the fantastic Cleo at Carnegie Hall. She is an incredible singer with such a range of styles and nuance.It electrifies from the first note and mixes, blues, jazz, standards and comedy. The songs Methuselah and Turkish delight still have me laughing.The ending Hoagy Carmichael has you wanting more and more.A must-have disc and one of the best introduction to this wonderful singer who seems to be somewhat overlooked in the US."
4,Excellent,"Gilbert Morris is an excellent author! When he teams up with his son and daughter- it only gets better! This series, The Omega Trilogy, gives insight into what the end times might be like. If you're interested in that time period I strongly urge you to read this series. It can really bring you to your knees in prayer!"
4,A step up from most of the others,"This is a very good book. Unlike the host of other endtimes fiction available, Fallen Stars actually has something to say. Rather than using the apocalypse as some sort of big budget spectacle, Morris actually uses the setting to say something about God and mankind. He delves into the philosophy much more than the Left Behind series does and leaves you thinking about Christianity in a slightly better way. Fallen stars actually reminds me a bit of Caldwell's novel We All Fall Down, which also uses the apocalypse for religous exploration rather than simple plot purposes. Morris' novel isn't quite up to the level of Caldwell's masterpiece, but it's still head and shoulders above the rest of the endtime novels out there and I highly recomend it."
5,Delicious and Easy to Follow,"My husband has taken up cooking in the last few years and has begun to appreciate cookbooks. This is one of his favorites. We both love the recipes he has tried. He says, ""The recipes are delicious and easy to follow. Eula Mae's fascinating stories make the book even more enjoyable."""
5,A little piece of Acadiana.,"Besides a good collection of everyday Cajun food, this book is rich in the history and lore of the area. Thanks to Eula Mae Dore and Marcelle Bienvenue, the history as well as the recipes of this area will not be lost."
5,"Fun, flavorful, and fascinating","My wife and I have beek cooking from this great cook book for several years and it's become a staple in our kitchen.Recently, we hosted a dinner party with dishes coming entirely from Eula Mae (with music from The Big Easy soundtrack, Professor Longhair, and the Neville Brothers in the background). We had a great time, and gave each guest a copy of the cookbook as a gift.Most of Eula Mae's ingredients are common, but the magic of her recipes, the refreshing nature of the meal compositions, and the charm of her stories make this cookbook a unique and lasting addition to any kitchen.Sorry to hear she passed away. Thank heavens her recipes were saved for all of us to enjoy."
5,Eula Mae's Cajun Kitchen by Eula Mae Dore,"After a wonderful forward by Paul McIlhenny (Tabasco) and introduction byMarcelle Bienvenu (Who's your mama) you know this book has to be good.The recipes are by Eula Mae, a long time cook for the Tabasco company, andthe narative is by Marcelle. Together they provide an insightful look intoLouisana Cajun cooking."
5,Best Cookbook I've Ever Owned,Everything I've made from this cookbook (and it's been quite a lot) has been over-the-top good. It is 'hands-down' the best cookbook I've ever come across. I highly recommend it.
2,eula mae's kitchen,"The story the book tells is charming, taking me back to a different time, into a different world but one with echos of how my family lived when I was a child, enjoying nature's treasures in season and preserving for the long winter with fewer choices. We didn't use ""nasty"" canned foods and frozen things were limited to a few kinds of vegetables and meat, mostly from Grandmother's garden and the men's hunting and fishing trips. I'd love to visit the island and enjoy a meal at the restaurant. The recipees in the book sound very good as I am sure to find out when I try them. However, there are not very many recipees. I expected a great many more for the price of the book. That is why so few stars."
5,Fantastico!,"I originally bought this book for my bilingual (SP ENG) 3rd grade classroom, but I liked it so much I took it home for my own kids! The beautiful illustrations remind me of Frida Kahlo's work (without the gore). I couldn't believe the illustrator wasn't Mexican. The story itself is charming, and there are little subplots going on as well if you pay close attention to the illustration. This is also one of the few books my two year old (native English speaker) will tolerate listening to in Spanish, so it adds to her Spanish exposure. She likes to say, ""My book,"" but with this one, I say, ""No, Mommy's book."" I don't want to overdo it, but this may be my favorite children's book. Ever."
4,Nice song,It features singing from Bobby Brown and is off his last Temptation album.I like it now more then I did before
1,Thug Hatin',"This song is wack and Bobby Brown never should've came out of retirement; his career ended years ago. Anyway, Bobby sounds awful and Ja Rule wants to be hardcore, but it ain't working. I bet everyone's forgotten that this song even came out. If you happen to catch it on the radio, change the station."
5,Lamentablemente una produccion oscura pero muy buena.,"Mucha gente no conoce esta produccion de Tony Vega. Mucha gente no sabe que las canciones que cantan de Tony Vega salen de esta produccion discografica. Para ayudar al ""web-site"" voy a listar el orden y el nombre de las canciones de este disco.1. Lo Mio Es Amor2. Dile3. Cuando Te Encontre4. Love Is Forever5. Ella6. Vivo7. Solo Faltas Tu8. Me Quito El NombreTodos los temas son buenos, pero mis sobresalientes temas son Lo Mio Es Amor, Dile (mi favorito), Cuando Te Encontre, Ella, Solo Faltas Tu."
4,Great fun!,"In the 1960's of an alternative universe and with elements of Nero Wolfe, Sherlock Holmes and The Man from U.N.C.L.E., you have a delightful combination of fantasy and who-done-it. The stories - The Eyes Have It, A Case of Identity, The Muddle of the Woad, and Too Many Magicians - made me laugh, and think and marvel at the talent and imagination of Randall Garrett. I shouldn't read them back-to-back as they can get to be a bit much. If you enjoy Jasper Fforde, you might enjoy Lord Darcy as well."
5,Fantastic alt-hist!,"Lord Darcy is sort of a Alt-hist Sherlock Holmes, but in an England where Richard the Lionharted lived on and founded a great dynasty and there's magic. Not a lot, and it follows hard & fast rules, but it plays a part in the series. In fact playing Watson to Darcy is the much more competent Archmage Master Sean, without whom Darcy would be at a loss for many of his clews. Of course, what really solves the mysteries are Darcy's deductive reasoning. The books are have the elements of a pastiche, as nearly every other detective shows up in a guise (Nero Wolfe, James Bond, etc)."
5,Any cartographers out there?,I fell in love with Lord Darcy and Co. decades ago. My original paperbacks are falling apart so I'm buying the omnibus. One thing I felt was missing were maps. I actually made my own using clues in the stories and maps of various times from a great historical atlas of medieval Europe and adjoining areas. It was fun but half-ass since I've little skill in making maps. I wish that someone who knows what they're doing will someday take up this project and get it published in a future edition.
4,Thank little Nkima!,"This was the twelfth Tarzan book written by Edgar Rice Burroughs. A German man asks Tarzan to find his son, who set out in search of a lost city of white people in Africa. The young German, Erich von Harben, finds a lost city, which is descended from the Roman Empire. Meanwhile, Tarzan finds a rival lost city, also descended from the Roman Empire. Chapters alternate between what Tarzan and Erich are doing, until the two storylines converge at the end of the book. Another fun Tarzan book from Burroughs."
3,Okay but could have lived without reading it,"This book's plot was pretty well finished about halfway through the book - from that point on it felt like reading 'filler' to meet a page requirement. The romantic struggle between hero and heroine was redundant & often dull. Almost a wall-banger, I wish I had not bothered to buy it."
2,Spell check please.....,I would have enjoyed this book more if there were not so MANY typos and incorrect words used. It took away the enjoyment of reading trying to decode text throughout a lot of the story. Re edit please.
1,Kindle version is not formatted very well,As the title of this review suggests the Kindle version of this book is not formatted properly to the point of interferring with the reading of the book. I would not recommend it for Kindle.Also the Hero has a standing Saturday night appointment with the town Madam. I don't know about anyone else but that turned me off totally. If the heroine had had a standing appointment as a working girl the Hero would not have wanted her. But the heroine is supposed to want him??? what a double standard!!!! Give me a break!!
1,language a surprise,I had searched for Christian fiction and this book came up on the screen. I bought it and another by the same author. I have removed both from my kindle without reading more than a chapter or two because of the inappropiate use of the Lord's name. I regret spending the money. Can one not buy a good plot without having it contain objectionable language?
4,Every book is wonderful!,This is the third book by this author that I have read and each book is just as good as the last! I can't believe she is such a talented writer and her books are so affordable on Kindle! They are definitely worth the money! The writing is very descriptive and you can just get lost in the world she creates. I will probably end up buying every book she wrote.
5,Another Great Read,I am constantly pleased with this Authors books. Each story is a pleasant step back in time when life was simple. It makes me appreciate all the hardships our ancestors endured. I recommend any and all of her books
4,gentle romance,"Very gentle romance set in 1800's Montana, when men were men and women were meant to be softly spoken demure ladies.... this particular heroine wont be a stereotype of this particular era... which makes you want to cheer her on... especially when she clashes with the strong silent hero, Tyler. Great novel to curl up with ..."
4,Very Good,"The Jeff Beck is a classic guitar player , I had in my maind the others like Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page and etc, hewever after read the Led Zeppwlin bibliografy I change my maind and now I start to enjoy Jef Back and this album there is a fantastic music from Jimmy "" Backs Bolero""."
4,guitar 101,"Any quitarist worth her salt will tell you that Beck is the only player who can rate with Hendrix in terms of raw talent (maybe Duane Allman slips in there as well). This record is pure, unadorned blues/rock Beck and is essential listening for anyone serious about rock guitar. This is not to slight Blow By Blow or Wired from the mid-70s fusion period, but as a *rock* player, this is Beck at his best. Many have said that this album is the template for heavy rock, released slightly before the first Led Zeppelin album. Nevermind who came first, this is the one to go to, guitar-wise.Album overall is three and one-half stars. As a testament to quitar genius, it rates five."
5,Historical Recording,"Historically speaking, Jeff Beck rates as one of the greatest guitarist of all time. Making his mark in the late 60's while playing with some of the gods of rockNroll, he earned his respect and still perfoms quite well to this day. I used to listen to this album as a teenager in the early 70's. I recently purchased the CD, and as I rembered it is a priceless recording. A couple of things make this recording unique. Number one,,, guess who the singer is???YOUTHFUL ROCKING ROD STEWART. Perhaps his first major gig. His voice is as pure as ever, if not his sweetest. He does sing with more of a true rock style than in his later career as a pop singer. The second thing that takes this recording to another level is the song selections. Can you imagine Jeff Beck playing Old Man River, and having Rod Stewart singing the song.How about ""Zeppelin's, You Shook Me"".This music is timeless as is Ellington and Bach"
5,British Blues and then some.....Rod and Jeff,"I had the vinyl of this when it first came out. I don't remember it sounding this good. I had a cheap record player (all I could afford) but I knew it was special. Especially considering where these fellows came from, and how young they were. I didn't like Stewart's version of the blues at first but it grew on me. I had a lot of Ray Charles, Muddy Waters and other American blues masters and this seemed so alien at first. Zep hit not too long after this and all of it took off with the public in a big way. You know the story. This is on fire, well played and still sounds terrific. Every song is good. Stewart always liked to add a folk tune or two to all of his early albums. The apocalyptic ""Morning Dew"" is the Standout folk tune here. Beck does a great ""Greensleeves"" also.Beck and Stewart were a great team."
3,Never a Dull Moment,"Maybe it was Rod's sweetness, or just the fact that it didn't just drone on in some blues rock netherworld, but I actually liked this record. There's some Spirit at play here and I loved that Beck included ""Greensleeves."" Who knew? It's quirky and playful and ""Never a Dull Moment."" 3.5 Stars."
5,Classic blues metal,This was a great album by metal legend Jeff Beck. It was his best album by his Jeff Beck Group. It also showed that Rod Stewart could sing heavy metal. This is similer to Zep in style so it must be a winner!
5,Damn good stuff,"like everyone else seems to think so this is great. i had never heard any of jeff's material, only some yardbirds, so, having heard some rod stewart, being a fan of the rolling stones (particularly the 70s era and on, with ron wood) i was curious. throw in the fact that beck is renowned as one of the best guittarist, i went and bought this cd on a whim, and i was thrilled with the results, very similar to zep's music, this could be the foundation for the ""shapes of things to come"""
5,The late 60s had some great music,"Jeff Beck's first album entitled ""Truth"" is a classic rock masterpiece showcasing the voice of Rod Stewart, the virtuosity of Beck's guitar playing with Ron Wood on bass and Mick Waller on drums. 'The Shape of Things' (a Yardbirds staple) opens this disc and the rest, they say, is history. One of the highlights of this fantastic cd is 'Beck's Bolero' which, btw, includes work from Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones and Jimmy Page. The whole disc is terrific and belongs along the side of works from Page, Clapton, Hendrix, Santana, etc. Essential classic rock to say the least."
3,Jerry McCulley?,Nice album but Amazon's reviewer Jerry McCulley is highly misguided if he really thinks that rock fans backed the wrong band by making Led Zeppelin legendary rather than this.
1,dosent play,"could not get the CD to play on any player, But from owing the ablum i know the music is very good"
5,"My opinion of Jeff Beck, Truth CD","Plenty of Good tracks, only 1 or 2 I think could have been left off (Old Man River?). You'll enjoy if you're a Blues fan- rare chance to hear Rod Stewart (before he became a Pop Idol) sing the Blues, & he does it well. Some great piano work too!"
3,better,better than the other that i have purchased.it's not my typeis artist of musici'll have purchase to discover th
5,Truth (Exp) Jeff Beck,"This is where Jeff Beck's solo career launched. Arguably our greatest contemporary guitar innovator, Beck's album dazzled and amazed when it was first released, and holds up extremely well today."
4,Beck Tells The Truth,"Jeff Beck made his name as a guitar virtuoso in the seminal English rock group The Yardbirds. Striking out on his own, he enlisted the aid of a young Scot, an unknown Rod Stewart and future Stone, Ron Wood to create a real 60's gem. The opening track is a remake of his previous band's ""Shape Of Things"" and it shows off his furious guitar work as well as Mr. Stewart's whiskey-soaked vocal prowess. The album moves between blues tracks like ""You Shook Me"", ""Blues Deluxe"" & ""I Ain't Superstitious"" to traditional stuff like the folksy ""Greensleeves"" (Mr. Beck shows he can play the acoustic guitar with the same skills as the electric) and the traditional ""'Ol Man River"". A truly adventurous album that may well be the peak of Mr. Beck's career."
5,LED ZEPPELIN 1 ?,"This album is very similar to the first Led Zeppelin album, and this is a compliment. It was released at the same time and the sound is in the same style. There is even one song that appears in both, ""You Shook Me"". The quality of the two records is very high. Beck plays very roughly, with a lot of energy and feeling. Ron Wood plays with fast fingers and sounds like John Paul Jones (who plays organ on ""Ol'Man River""). Rod Stewart sings with his unique voice songs very different from the style he would go for in the future solo career - very interesting. The most admired tune by rock musicians, ""Greensleeves"", is here played beautifully in acoustic guitar by Jeff Beck alone. Nicky Hopkins also is here in two songs. Everyone who likes rock'n'roll must have this."
5,READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY IT,"I love Amazon, and find it is usually the best place to purchase boks. However, this particular book is much cheaper at places such as Murry McMurry. Just thought I would share."
2,What Christians Need To Know And The Book Forgot To Say!,"As Christians, we must defend our rights and our nation from internal attack. When asked by the IRS to conduct an audit of your return, the very best thing to say is, ""Is it mandatory or voluntary for me to let you see my private books and records?"" Just watch, they will never answer - because it's VOLUNTARY! The courts have said so! It HAS TO BE voluntary, otherwise it would be a violation of your 4th and 5th amendment rights! You NEVER have to let the IRS see your records - even if they send you a summons, all you do is show up and claim the 5th each time they ask a question, or to see a document!! The book never tells you this!!"
4,For The Price You Can't Beat It!,"I am from the old school. So I not only loved the VHS recording format, but if I wanted to dip into modern day technology the photo feature on this particular model will allow me to. Compared to other camcorders under $250 the picture isn't as great but good enough! Remember you get the best of both worlds with this one!! It's easy to use and it's cheap!!!!!!!!!"
1,Panasonic PV-L354 - NO SOUND is no good!!,"I, too, thought this was an excellent camcorder for several months until I did a playback of one of those events that can't be repeated and....NO SOUND!! The video looks great, but...NO SOUND!! It had worked fine on several occasions and even now, I can shoot a quick video and check to make sure there is sound on the playback before I shoot the important moment I want to capture. Then I shoot the main event and, again, NO SOUND!! Sometimes it works fine, sometimes it doesn't...very unpredictable. I thought it was operator error on my part until I saw Mark Noll's review.Panasonic's customer service was no help at all. It's time for a new (non-Panasonic) camera.So...you might get one that works fine, but with this camcorder, you are taking a chance that, at some point, you will miss something great."
1,This camera stinks!!!,"What a mess!! Last summer, I tried to tape some very special events and there was no sound. The very frustrating part was that it was a spuratic problem. One day it would work and the next day I got no sound. YOu never had any idea if it would work, which meant that some super special moments were lost forever. There was always a picture, but half the time there was no sound. I finally got so frustrated that I quit taping anything. Repair would be $175, so it is not worth fixing. I was glad to see that other people were having the exact problem, so I know it is not just me. My camera is going in the trash can. Don't buy this camera. YOu can't recapture those lost treasures."
3,not original,"this is not original but is ok..I was read this item was discontinued years ago, but I still like it and this is the closest I found."
5,Best Darn Freezer Paper in the West,It's freezer paper. It has a paper side and a waxy side. I use it to line my soap molds. What more is there to say?
4,Typical Wilkie Collins,"This is a typical Wilkie Collins book. At first blush, it could be a ghost story, but there's more at work as with most of Collins' works. There are a few places in the book that get bogged down in dialect and a crazy side-story, but it's still very good. Plus it was free! Overall it's a very satisfying read."
5,The Real Story,"As a musician, I was very fortunate to know Danny personally as he played in one of his earliest DC bands with my uncle, Rick Harmel. I recall that he took time to show me a few practice scales almost everytime I ran into him - no matter how busy he appeeared - and he was a warm-hearted, generous guy to the core.This book balances the abrupt, tragic end of Danny's life with the highs and motivations that made Gatton a player's player. It also spotlights many of the people (like Arlen Roth) that contributed their loyalty and friendship to Danny. Thank you Ralph for a great homage and superb, thorough account of the life of the Master of the Telecaster. A ""must read"" for all guitarists - and anyone else who enjoys a moving account of an accomplished human being."
3,Easy to read????,"They keep telling me that Hawking writes layman friendly stuff. This one is better in that respect, but still a little tough, I think."
1,COLD LEFTOVERS,"AFTER READING ""THEORY OF EVERYTHING"" I WAS ANXIOUS TO READ ANOTHER WORK BY PROFFESSOR HAWKINGS.THIS IS A VASTLY INFERIOR BOOK.IT SEEMS TO MADE UP OF LEFTOVER PIECES AND LACKS COMPLETELY THE FOCUS AND CLEAR VISION OF ""THEORY"".I WAS DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED.I WOULD RATE THIS FAR BEHIND ""BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME""[IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE A SERIOUS SCHOLAR] AND EVEN FARTHER BEHIND ""THEORY OF EVERYTHING"" WHICH IS CERTAINLY FAR EASIER TO UNDERSTAND."
2,"glib, but well illustrated","If you liked Hawking's previous book ""Brief History of Time"" then you may like this one. But, the fact is, BHT was a very poor attempt, particularly in comparison to many others that have come out since then on the same subject. The illustratios are in some cases original and worth a look. But in the end you will have absolutely no idea what Hawking is talking about. This is unfortunate because I think a good set of editors could , in fact, elicit a really interesting book out of the guy, but I think it would take much more time and effort. What worries me is that the text might have been a rush job perhaps because Hawking is in poor health."
2,"pretty pictures, but no substance","I give the 2 stars for the illustrators. They did a superb job trying to represent the ideas put on paper by Hawking. However the text on the other hand was overly simplified to appeal to a larger, non-science centric audience, who don't understand the complex formulas and ideas the govern the universe. He went too simplistic in this book and left out the explanations for what he says. He claims something is true, but never explains why or how. He never goes into the explanation of the illustrations so looking at some of them leaves me wondering ""what does that mean?"" Also, there are way too many illustrations and not enough text."
3,Beautiful Presentation,"This book is a beautiful presentation of topics like relativity, and it includes some related history and personalities, but it is not for anyone interested in understanding any topics covered in the book. The coverage is so cursory that anyone who already has ANY understanding will be disappointed."
2,It's a good way to make money! Write a book like this!!!,"...I like this book! I thing it is just a PRETTY BOOK to add to your library shelves or to place it on your coffee table to show that (yes I got this book!) which is highly publitized, and it is in your face whenever you log to any book selling websites or in every major bookstore. A brief history of time is definitly a better book to read and Mr. Hawking shoud stick to that type of science and writing . I'd describe this book as fancy magazine you'd look at the pictures and you'd read some interesting titles or few paragraghes- waiting in doctor's office and when your name is called you'd just put it down and forget about it..."
4,A Good Introduction,"Quantum mechanics. String Theory. General Relativity. These are not topics for the casual science buff, nor will they be readily grasped with one reading of this ambitious text. In his Introduction, Mr. Hawking concedes that compiling a text to serve as an introduction to the fascinating yet complex theories of modern astrophysics was no simple feat. Whether or not he succeeded is for the reader to decide, and will be determined mostly by whether or not they have any background in science, and how willing they are to commit to the material. I would assert that this book is beyond the scope of anyone without at least a rudimentary understanding of basic physics, higher mathematics, and astronomy. In the end, regardless, this book can serve as no more than an introduction that hopefully sparks an interest in the great questions of our universe and a desire to learn more."
3,And that's MY universe?,"Hawking's discoveries are indeed amazing, as is his book ""A Brief History Of Time"", but ""The Universe In A Nutshell"" can hardly be put in the same category. This book was intended to be even more simple and easy-to-understand than ""A Brief History Of Time""; what seems to have been changed, though, is - the facts have been kept, but the explanations taken away as too hard to understand.I refuse to just accept things without knowing WHY, so I didn't like the book. I learned nothing new. The pictures, while certainly interesting, didn't provide any information at all. Hawking attempts to write about EVERYTHING - the whole universe, indeed - but in the end you realize he has truly explained nothing.I urge you to buy ""A Brief History Of Time"" instead, if you haven't already. Maybe the universe just cannot be put in a nutshell..."
2,Bah!,"The only reason I gave this book two stars is that the illustrations in it are very nice to look at. Hawking is not very good at explaining all of the highly speculative theories he and those in his profession make their living off of. Indeed, the illustrations mentioned above actually do more to confuse than enlighten in many cases. His first big hit, ABHOT, was far more interesting, informative, and better written. It would seem that in ""dumbing down"" his material for this book, he simplified it to the point where crucial information was actually left out. Get ABHOT if you want a good read. Get this book if you want pretty pictures."
3,Don't waste your time,"Anyone who has high expectations of Hawking after reading _A Brief History of Time_ will be sorely disappointed.This book is filled with pseudoscience and science fiction, and Hawking makes no attempt to separate them from the accepted ""facts"" of modern theoretical physics.If you are looking for new discoveries in science, read a magazine. If you like whitty anecdotes about scientists, read Feynman. If you want to read about the power of the scientific method, read Sagan. And if you want to read science fiction, read Asimov. (If you want to read someone who is still alive, read Gleick).Don't waste your time with this garbage. This book was a major disappointment, probably more so because of how good his first book was."
2,"Daren M. Williams must be one of those ""Book Burners""","This book was entertaining however not entirely enlightening. There is no question in my mind that Stephen Hawking knows what he is talking about because he has the mathematical and physical intuition to understand the intricacies of cosmology to back up the bizzarre images he writes of in his book, however most people reading his book do not. This poses a problem because there is a vast gulf between the mathematical reality of the universe and human intuition and there is no way the material hawking is presenting can ever be totally understood without math. Sorry to have to say this, but Hawking's book only creates more confusion than there already is about the universe and people like mister williams (an earlier reviewer) are examples of what happens when you write about cosmology for the masses."
2,(Some) good pictures... nothing more,"Look,I don't consider myself to be stupid, and I usually catch up pretty fast.However, it seems to me that when this dude writes a book, he writes it for others like him.Now, you do the math... There's no one else like him!The book is EXTREMELY hard to understand. At least for me...the not so stupid guy.He is NOT getting into details like another reviewer wrote, he just throws in his explanation and moves on, without more proper examples.I was a very dissapointed, although I'm not gonna quit, and I'm gonna try again!-RoNNY"
3,The Universe in a Nutshell,Better than most of the recent output on cosmology and physics. More for the coffee table than for reading. The illustration are very good.
3,Difficult Concepts,"A Startrek to EternityAfter having read, and thoroughly enjoyed, Stephen Hawking's previous book (A Brief History of Time) I was a little disappointed in this one. Not that it isn't entertaining or that Professor Hawking isn't presenting it as well as he did in 'History,' it's just that the subject material is so much more difficult to comprehend that I'm sure the casual reader (such as myself) would have trouble getting through it. The theories presented are so 'off the wall' and are such a long way from being verified that it appears to be nothing more than wild guesses - but I suppose that's the world of a theoretical physicist."
4,"Way over my head, but interesting.","Before you read this book, you should at least have a basic understanding of physics. He talks about a lot of technical stuff that is over my head, but what I did understand in the book was fasciniating. The graphics and illustrations are great and he writes in a way that is easy to understand, assuming you know your physics. If you are big into theoritical physics, you won't want to miss this one."
2,Making it nebulous,"In trying to put the universe in a nutshell, Prof. Hawking had left out most of the interesting details. Some of the conclusions would even be misleading without the necessary details. The diagrams too are truly artistic but lack information. In ""Brief History"" Hawking was bold enough to hint ever so subtly that God is the Architect of this universe. In Nutshell, Hawking manages to cleverly wheel around this critical matter. The Brief History may be long-winded but it has the facts! On the other hand Nutshell makes a good coffee table travel brochure."
2,Differing Basics,"Time does not exist.Only motion exists.it is the yardstick not some fictional thing known as ""time"". Because we started out with the fiction and dimension it as v=d/t does not make the fiction true. the physical yardstick is v measured as a fraction of the speed of light. It is needed to measure d and with it t is only a crutch required by human senses perhaps but certainly not by reality. we measure both t and d using the same yardstick i.e. ""v"" so one of them does not exist. :)"
1,ANOTHER LEFTOVER REHASH,"BESIDES THE RECENTLLY RELEASED ""THEORY OF EVERYTHING"" PROFFESSOR HAWKINS RECENT BOOKS HAVE ALL BEEN REHASHES OF HIS EARLIER WORKS PUFFED UP SO THEY COULD BE SOLD AS A BOOK.MANY OF THE SAME PIECES ARE BETTER AND MORE SIMPLY TOLD IN ""THEORY"" WHICH EVEN THOUGH FAR LESS EXPENSIVE IS CLEARLY HIS MASTERWORK.NUTSHELL IS PROFFESSOR HAWKINS LEAST IMPORTANT WORK AND IN FACT IS AN EMBARRASSMENT TO HIS GREAT LEGACY."
5,Worth 6 stars,An expanding universe and its physics and mystery fluently imparted. An easy read under the circumstances of the subject matter.
2,Fine illustrations; incomprehensible text,"I am a physician but have read a lot of popularized physics. Hawking's book is a major disappointment. That which is understandable (such as the Uncertainty Principle) is given no new treatment. The latter half of the book is completely incomprehensible. Hawking just throws out one assertion after another with nothing to link them logically or even to show how they relate to the physical world. The sections on time travel and p-branes are especially weak and not worth the time trying to read them. Kip Thorne has done a much more lucid treatment of time travel in his book, and Michio Kaku has done a better job explaining string theory.The strong aspect of _The Universe in a Nutshell_ is its illustrations; even if you didn't read any of the text, the illustrations are worth the purchase price."
2,The Universe in a Nutshell,"A hollow shadow of A Brief History of Time. Mostly a history of whose who in physics with relatively obtuse explanations for discoveries. Formatted like a children's book. This knock off was a way for Stephen Hawkings to hopeful make more money based on the success of his first and quite excellent book. But not much effort or thought went into this one. And some of his explanations leave more confusion than understanding because of it. It is almost as big a hoax as his ""virtual time"", which was a mathematical ruse to try to overcome the fact that his regression to prove the expansion of space refused to reach a zero momentum at its source. With that one all he had to do was realize that everything he said was true except that there was no singularity. The law of physics he missed was that when the universe was collapsing it reached critical energy before it could become a true singularity and so re-exploded. To bad on both counts, Stephen. The book is a bust."
4,One of the very best,"This is one of the very best science books for the popular audience. Those of you who are familiar with the works of Michael Greene will even be impressed. In gerneral, I don't believe that Hawking can compare to Greene in his ability to explain very difficult topics in modern physics to the average interested reader, but he comes close in this one. One exception where Hawking falls short, however, is in his attempt to explain the concept of ""imaginary time"". A much better explanation can be found in ""The Fallacy of Fine-Tuning"" by Victor J. Stenger."
5,'The Universe in a Nutshell' in a Nutshell,"Stephen Hawking's prose is clear, concise, and rich with literary explanations - quite a change from the masses of equations most theoretical physicists' books are rich with. Hawking paints a rich, detailed picture of the cosmos, physics, time travel, and many other magical topics. Readers will be swept over the event horizon of Hawking's passion for the universe - but be careful. There may be no return."
5,Very deep but readable.,"I think Dr. Hawking did a better job on this book than his work ""A Brief History of Time"". Being someone who has never had a physics class, I still enjoyed this book. Some of the subjects are over my head, but I was at least able to go back, re-read sections, and at least get a weak grasp on what was being discussed.Dr. Hawking is a great writer and has a great sense of humor. If you are interested in physics, buy this book."
2,Shell Game?,"I looked forward to Hawking's book to expand my understanding of the science I never had time for in school.Sad to report, this slick book with great graphics has left me fraustrated at even a laymen's understanding of the ""principles of the Universe.""Unfortunately, no one is writing about science like Carl Sagan did."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"I am so disappointed with this book. While the pictures arenice, the text is largely useless. You can not learn fromthis book. Instead, the author simply tells you one thingafter another with hardly any motivation and rarely givingan explanation that lets you know what is going on. If youwant a book that you thumb through now and then, look atsome nice pictures, have a few jargony words thrown yourway, then you might like this. But if you want a book thatgives you a real glimpse of modern physics and gives you somereal insight into what is happening at the cutting edge and why,then this book will leave you as disappointed as I am."
5,Best Non-Physicists Book on Physics Ever by a Physicist,"Stephen Hawking is probably the best teacher of abstract concepts of the century. He obviously is a naturally gifted teacher. He easily describes concepts that many intellectuals would find trouble even understanding well enough that at age 10 I was able to understand this.For those of us who couldn't quite grasp the linear-minded book ""A Brief History of Time"", this book is excellent. It's excellent photographs, diagrams, and pictoral explanations make it easy to follow the explanation of these advanced ideas.I think that anyone who wants to know more about theoretical physics, but doesn't wan't to earn a PhD to understand it should read this book."
4,A glorious survey of modern physics,"Hawking has pulled together an imense amount of physics in this gorgeous hard cover edition. The breadth of topics is far reaching, yet simplified in a manner such that people from non-physics backgrounds can readily grasp. For those looking for more depth and less show his lectures on quantum general relativity and black hole law is highly recommended. Is Hawking playfully using stringy methods in forming the laws of black hole mechanics while sharply critizing the string theory, or is he truely abandoning string theory in favor of a more straight-forward and generic approach?"
2,Dumbed-Down,"I'm afraid I'm one of those people not at all happy with this book. I found it badly written and essentially 'dumbed-down' a little too much in an attempt to have a wider appeal than a purely scientific community. While this is fine given that it is a popular science book, I don't think it does justice to the intelligence of even the non-science reader. I found that the illustrations, while plentiful were merely page-fillers.Try again Stephen"
3,Could Have Been So Much Better,"This book could have been a lot better.This is a book for people with some previous knowledge of quantum physics. It starts nicely enough but then jumps into scientific jargon without properly explaining the terms.If you haven't read, for instance, ""The Elegante Universe""(a must-read) you will be inveitably lost. Also, one feels that some parts could be developed further (such as the ones on alternate universes).In the end it fails in providing the lay reader with the vision of the universe in a nutshell.However, it must be said the the ilustrations themselves are worth the book. They provide a magical sense of the enormity of the implications of quantu theory."
4,Very interesting and easy to read,"I have been interested in astrophysics since I was a kid, and Stephen Hawking 's theories have always been of huge interest to me. I feel that his summary of his as well as other scientists' theories past and present are put forth in a relatively easy-to-read way that could be enjoyable even to someone who has no background on astrophysics."
2,The uncracked nutshell,"I remember reading ""A Brief History of Time"" and loving it, so it was with great anticipation I started this one. Sadly, I was disappointed. The book is dumbed-down to the point of being almost incomprehensible and the pictures are largely useless (pretty, but useless). Hawking makes statements without providing explanations or, worse, he makes statements that literally make no sense. How can the outside of a sphere make contact with the outside of another sphere (branes in the book) except at one point? What does it mean to say time might be represented by lines of longitude? (The lines of latitude I understood, at least.) Why does the intersection of two time streams produce an area where time stands still? Lest you think me unusually dumb, I actually majored in physics (good thing, or I'd have gotten even less out of it).It was a good effort and the scope of the book is fascinating, but the execution makes it a one-time read only."
2,If you really want to understand--this will disappoint,"The United States Tax Code is incredibly complex, hopelessly tangled, and the a notorius generator of coarse epithets. But it's all there. With patience, intelligence, and a willingness to read and re-read, you can work it out. You can't do that with Universe because it's not all there. It is as though Mr. Hawking's word processor had a ""make it fit"" key that did so by deleting every second paragraph and maybe a few random sentences to boot.The book is a beauty. Its illustrators should win a prize. It appears, however, Mr. Hawking never explained anything to them either, and they just decided to do their own thing to get paid..."
2,A Hawking Disappointment,"After reading and enjoying Hawking's 'Tour de Force' in ""A Brief History of Time"", this book is a real let-down. The text does not really explain anything, but merely references developments and theories which are pertinent to the subject. What the book lacks in Hawking's generally fascinating expositions, is somewhat compensated by the great graphic illustrations, making this book more of a coffee-table decoration than a good read."
1,Not Science,"This is not what one should expect from a scientist. Rarely will you find any logical proofs backing up outlandish statements made, so I say it is a bunch of rubbish, which lacks any rigid scientific proofs. I think it is about time some of these physicists stop with all this sensationalist rhetoric and back up what they say with some solid proof."
2,Quantity does not equal quality...,"Over the years I have found some glaring errors in the Retriever's Guide, including wrong names for director, writer, etc. I don't know if they still do it, but they had Don ""The Dragon"" Wilson starring in films from the 1930's under his filmography. Take it with a grain of salt...if they made this many mistakes in credits, how do you know the films were really watched?"
2,No better than 1998 edition,"Really enjoyed and appreciated 1998 edition, and felt we should update to the 2000 edition, in order to review past two years' offerings. Unbelievably disappointing, and a waste of money. Can't count the number of 1999 movies that we have looked up, but are not listed. Apparently Connors and Craddock simply didn't have time or resources to update their book. They simply changed dates and cover colors to sell more copies. May try another copy in 2005. They surely will have updated 1999-2002 by then."
3,Videohound's Golden Movie Retriever,"So, they've got a cute gimmick with the title, the bones and the Woof rating for real dogs. But ... I'm giving my copy away and replacing it with the latest Leonard Maltin review book. Why? Because I didn't like the reviews as well, I didn't like the cast listing at the end of the review, the alphabetizing was very confusing (I spent 5 minutes looking for Mrs. Miniver - why is Mrs. before Mr.?)--Maltin's alphabetizing might be idiosyncratic but it's usable once you know it. And it doesn't have as many reviews - I love the old B-movie series and went to look up a Charlie Chan movie and it wasn't there! I'm very happy to have Maltin back by my chair!"
1,Duh!,"Couldn't wait to receive this tome of video nuggets, but the first movie I looked up, one of my favorites, had a short, lame, synopsis that didn't even touch one iota on the uniqueness, humor or twists involved in the plot. (It's a cult classic, Rustler's Rhapsody, with Tom Berenger and Andy Griffith; hilarious). It is more than obvious that the editor and staff didn't see the movie, nor talked to anyone that had. Guess I'll relegate it to the use as a door-stop or grandchild booster at the dinner table. There are worse fates, I guess."
1,Lost Book,"I never recieved this book. I suppose it was lost in the mail. The company was great about it, and made sure that i recieved my money back. I do have an older version of this book and it really is handy to have around if you are a big movie fan."
4,"A great reference book, but reviews are wildly uneven.","This is a great reference book but a lousy source for movie reviews. Apparently they have a large team of reviewers.... some share your taste in movies, some share the taste of your 12-year old daughter. This wouldn't be so much of a problem if they'd identify reviewers by name or initials.Another problem is that it's not great for browsing: the sheer volume of old movies and b-movies tends to overwhelm more current, reasonably well-made films. Another quibble: ""classics"" and films dealing with race or other social issues get automatic high marks--probably another product of the team approach to reviewing.Still, a great reference book."
5,Brilliant guide,"Many Video Hound collections have graced my den floor, always available for quick reference. This time the Retriever was a gift for someone who'd never heard of it. She was thrilled."
3,What?,What year is this for? I'm looking for something for around 1930 1950... Does anyone know? I need to know soon so please respond!!
1,bulky but not complete many shown on TV not listed,Only reviews movies on DVD format and many shown on TV are not listed in the inconveniently heavy book . reviews are marginal
4,Great resource for movie lovers,"It's been about 8 years since I bought one of these, long overdue. I don't always agree with their slant on movies, but the summaries and information about movies is very valuable, even in the days of IMDB and its kin. The indexing is also very handy, a fast way to find movies by a specific director, or starring a specific actor, with less clutter than most Internet databases."
5,Videohound Movie Guide,THIS is the movie guide that you need. Very complete with solid reviews (5 bones rating to 1 bone rating) for most films that are available on DVD or VHS. This book is a very large volume with a wealth of movie information.
4,Movies on Video/ DVD,"As far as this is my seventh yearly Moview Review book I've purchased I feel that the reviews for each movie give me and other friends an idea of wether we'll like the movie (if we buy it) also has a pretty good listing of most stars if I am looking for a movie, but don't remember the title. I also like that this book lists independants as well as the million dollar movie studios. I sometimes discount the bones as that's the opinion of the reviewer who may not think like me or may be looking for perfection whereas I'm looking to be entertained as well as gain some knowledge because I feel that many movies mirror current events (not just documentaries)."
3,Complete but innaccurate,"I suppose we can't expect the editor to have watched all many-many thousands of movies that are reviewed, but the number of errors is astonishing. Plot summaries often bear little resemblence to the actual plot of the movie, character names are wrong, etc. Rather disappointing actually."
4,helpful resource guide for judging movies,"Video Hound is a trusted resource in checking out movies before viewing--the reviews are usually right on the money and are often humorous to read. I use this guide book and cross reference the reviews with Leonard Maltin-- using both books, you cannot go wrong."
4,Video hound book,"If this one had a separate listing of the top rated movies available, I'd give this a 5 star rating. Except for that, it's very good. I concur with all of the ratings in it; they eliminate the usual dogs and cut down the choices to the better movies on DVD or videotape."
4,The one to own.,"Videohound's Golden Movie Retriever 2000 is the guide to get if you're looking for quality. This is the best out there in my opinion. Leonard Maltin's guide is pretty good, but this guide is much better than that one and the other ones on the market. This guide is very comprehensive and I like the actor and director indexes too. Anybody that has an affinity for very good movie guides should buy this. Recommended."
5,It's my bible!!,"Videohound's Golden Movie Retriever is the absolute best for finding the perfect movie...The format is the easiest one to use and allows you to dispell that nagging feeling that you know that actor but can't figure out what he was in. Not to mention, those guys have a wicked sense of humor. Their reviews are right on...they even recognize the merit of truly horrible films that are entertaining none the less. I don't know what I did before I discovered the retriever. God bless 'em!"
3,A lot of information is missing,"I examined a copy of this book and found the information contained therein pertains mostly to films produced within the last 20 years. If you are a ""classic"" film buff, or just like films produced from 1930-60, you will find that you cannot cross-reference or search for data from those films. It's too bad that there isn't an index to songs used in films so that one can see which film featured a particular song. The composer index omits most of the composers from the ""Golden Era"" of American film-making, so that index is not helpful."
4,More than you'll ever know,"Every movie ever made. With summary, IDs of actors, writer, Director. What more can I say?"
5,Patriotism Illustrated,"Citizen Soldiers is an incredible look at an age when men, knowing they would likely die, put aside what was best for themselves and sacrificed for the good of the nation and the world. The hundreds of individual stories filled this reader with vivid pictures of an incredibly brutal war we can only pray never occurs again. It also distinguishes stark differences from an age of honor when men gave their lives so that others could be free, to an age where Americans elect and support a draft dodger as their president of the United States. Citizen Soldiers is guaranteed to enlighten those of us who did not live through the insanity of WWI or experience the courage of a generation of men."
4,Forgotten stories that need to be told...,"This book surpassed most others on WW II combat, at least on the grand scale. The daily struggles of the front-line infantrymen were brought to life via an accurate and honest approach. The vivid stories and anecdotes put you right there, in the foxhole, suffering, and waiting for that German counterattack. It made the reader proud to be an American, an will forever give respect to the memories of the men who fought."
5,Hedgerows and foxholes aren't fun!,"This audio brings a more intimate sense of this period of the war from the ingenuity of getting through the hedgrow country to the hour-by-hour details of life on the line. One stark statement that stands out is that when you were fighting and marching all day if you didn't dig a foxhole at night, you died. Those who did lived, those who didn't died. The Germans loved to fight and shell at night. These details and countless others bring the listener to the front and provide countless vignettes of astonishment, rage and exasperation."
5,a supurb book of american literature,stephen ambroses book of world war 2 is very compelling to any reader. thats why i gave it 5 stars. this is the first book i read by stephen ambrose and i hope his book d-day is just as good.this book combined the fear of the americans of what each and every soldier went through and the courage of each citizen soldier right up to the end of the german defeat. after reading this book i could understand a little more of what they went through in one of the worst war in americas history. i recommend this to anybody who is interested.
5,Buy it Now,"This book is great because it gives a very human slant to the story of the battles fought in WWII. Ambrose gives you a good sense of what it was like on the front lines. You get the feeling of the horrors these guys went through but also he gives you an idea of what it was like dealing with the ""little"" things people don't think about ( getting food to the front, how they lived in foxholes, etc. ). I'm also glad the author also spoke to the German soldiers and put some of their perspectives into the book. This book is great because you get a sense of what these people went through and sacrificed, and you wonder if you or the society you live in today could do the same thing."
5,Perfect.,Just like a book from Barnes & Noble. Perfect Quality. No issues. No complaints. Delivered before it was supposed to be and arrived early. Great!
4,A different perspective on WWII,"This is a different sort of history book. All told, my feelings about this book are mixed. Ambrose's perspective of the front line soldier certainly is fresh, but after more than 400 pages the stories start to run together. Did I learn something new? Sure. But at times I was trudging through the book, much like the soldiers at the battle of the bulge. I appreciated that Ambrose paid a great deal of respect to the German soldiers. His perspective on ""how a rich nation fights a war"" was also quite interesting."
4,America in WWII Finally Makes Sense,"Not until I read Citizen Soldiers did I come to an understanding of the US involvement in the European theater of WWII (at least, post D-Day). All those war movies and Sgt. Rock comic books made me think that the war was fought by small groups of men patrolling and killing as many ""Krauts"" as possible. Others have accurately commented on this book's function of highlighting the ""citizen soldiers"" who fought WWII, but I'd point out the excellent overall historical treatment that this book provides."
3,Too many one-sided bits of stories,"3 weeks of waiting for the book to arrive was rather long disappoinment. The book was just full of too many ""here & there"" stories told by the veterans yet contained a little information. Most of time bothering me is too many over-heroic statements trying to emphasize the courages of GI in ETO during WWII. No doubts what the soldiers had been doing there were just plain heroic but need no too many statements over it. Let the readers judge by themselves and let the book speaks the history by itself. Further, the books also need a lot more counterchecks from the enemy side (German) and even the allies (British, Canadian, Russian) to be more neutral."
2,"Muddled, confusing and hard to follow","Confusing, hard to follow. Difficult to maintain any interest since there is no thread or story. Characters come and go, sometimes with the same paragraph. Occassionally there is some meat. Very disappointing book. Would not recommend"
5,Thank You,This was a great transaction. There is a picture of my grandfather in this book!! Awesome product!
2,Not for the Serious Military Historian,"Having sat enthralled through Ambrose's D-Day book, I eagerly snapped up ""Citizen Soldiers"" without browsing through it. When I did sit down to read it, I thought that although the text flowed well, it was filled with factual errors that indicated a hurried job of indepth research which so characterized his previous works on D-Day, Company E 506th PIR and Pegasus Bridge. My overall impression was that Ambrose's publisher hoped to capitalize on his reputation when they printed this book. Some interesting vignettes and previously unpublished first person accounts, but much more could have been done with this subject."
5,Outstanding,In depth coverage of the war we all watched TV movies about or learned about (briefly) in school. This is the real magilla!
5,"A wonderful and horrible, yet essential experience.","This novel allows one to enter into the lives of the combatants on a multitude of levels. These are not the stories of the polished generals, these are the stories of the front line soldiers told in a clear voice with palpable vividness. The books moves fluidly and along the way you make friends only to lose them. Interestingly, some of the glimpses of the war relate the German frontline viewpoint. Ambrose includes comments from German soldiers who were there and this creates emotional squalls. An excellent read, bravo!"
2,Sadly disappointing,"Stephen Ambrose has enjoyed many a great review, but he isn't going to get one from this book. It is a long, drawn out account of battles beginning with the D-Day invasion and ending with the Allied victory over Nazi Germany. It is difficult to keep up with his characters, as he jumps sporatically from one story to the next, giving haphazard accounts of the progress of the war. For a book of its length, one would expect to get more ""meat"" out of the reading. As it stands, once completing this compiliation of hosh-posh, the reader is left feeling somewhat empty, and confused. The book does provide some entertainment value, but from a European historian's perspective, it is grave disappointment."
1,A cheap John Wayne film in a book.,A hastily compiled and biased jumble of anecdotes. Annoying and not infrequent errors of historical fact and technical detail demonstrate the author's lack of both research and depth of understanding. One long ego boost for the US Army. Easy reading for the masses but neither original nor of any historical value.
1,Here he goes again!,"Professor Ambrose must be raking in the dough, but I sure hope he's not sleeping well. LIFE magazine had better researched and more honest prose than Mr. Ambrose's latest sleight-of-hand. At least it's writers were well-compensated, unlike the serious authors/veterans who find their words surreptitiously packed into Mr. Ambrose's processed book-of-the-month offerings.One bit of advice for the good Professor: leave the telling of history to the professionals. Please!"
5,The WWII equivalent of Shelby Foote's Civil War Trilogy,"Having read both Shelby Foote's masterpiece 3 volume set on The Civil War, I was very pleased to find that Ambrose's book felt very much like Mr. Foote's. A detailed, yet accessible book on WWII in Europe, such as this is, has been needed for a very long time. This book should be required reading in High School history, instead of the dry, boring textbooks which do not even scratch the surface of WWII events."
2,I was disappointed and I expected more.,"Although I agree with the author's premise that the American troops fighting in the Western theater deserve modern recognition, I found that Mr. Ambrose repeated himself over and over again throughout the book and resorted to slang terms like ""Jabos"" and German ""88's"" to fill in detail. This wore thin quickly and after several chapters I began skimming for something fresh. In addition, Mr. Ambrose rarely introduced much less explained long quotations from the many veterans he interviewed. Such an approach might work in a Ken Burns' documentary (which I would not be surprised is in the works based on Mr. Burns'praise on the jacket cover), but it is not a satisfying substitute for real history. In short, I was frankly disappointed especially in light of Mr. Ambrose's experience and the vast wealth of materials, documents, and resources available to him. I'd take John Keegan or Cornelius Ryan anyday of the week."
4,"HONEST, GRAPHIC & LEVEL HEADED, GOOD READ","A WELL WRITTEN AND DESCRIPTIVE ACCOUNT OF THE FRONT LINE SOLDIER IN THE WARTIME U.S ARMY. WELL BALANCED AND HONEST REVIEW OF THE SUCCESSES AND FAILURES OF THE G.I. I WAS GLAD TO READ ( AT LAST ) CRITICISM OF THE OFFICERS AND GENERALS RUNNING THE WAR. RIGHTLY EXPOSES THE RIDICULUS SYSTEM OF FRONT LINE REPLACEMENTS - ARMIES HARDLY EVER LEARN FROM OTHER ARMIES ONLY FROM BITTER EXPERIANCE - THIS PRACTICE CONTINUED WELL INTO TO THE VIETNAM WAR. UNLIKE MANY U.S. ACCOUNTS OF THE ALLIED. GENRALSHIP THIS BOOK DOES NOT GO IN FOR ""MONTY BASHIN"" DOES NOT PORTRAY PATTON AS A GOD LIKE CREATURE."
5,Powerful stories form the backbone of this riveting book,"Steven E. Ambrose's Citizen Soldier is an exhaustively researched and prepared book on the battles from Normandy to the fall of Berlin during World War II.Includes information and collected stories from the soldiers (from Privates and NCO's to Colonels and Generals). Extremely riveting and well organized. A must for military history buffs. But it provides any reader insight into how and why men manage fight and survive in even the most horrid situations and condtions. It portrays personal acts of heroism, cowardice, and just plain struggles to endure and survive. I have yet come across a reader who regretted reading it.Citizen Soldier is probably better to listen to it on tape...14 tapes...but each hour is well worth it!"
4,Picks up where The Men From Company K left off,"After having read ""The Men of Company K"" for the third time, I was in a book store and noticed this title. To Ambrose's credit, he references ""...Company K"" as perhaps the best book of its type, reviewing the ETO from the sole perspective of men in the front-lines. In fact, ""Citizen Soldiers"" reads like a continuation of style, not to mention content, of ""...Company K,"" which made ""Citizen Soldiers"" nearly impossible to put down. Perhaps he borrowed a little too readily from ""...Company K."" I only hope the reader does in fact refer to the footnotes to review sources. None-the-less, it is a great read. This from the son of one of the personal histories recounted in both ""...Company K"" and ""Citizen Soldiers"". As I get older, I only wish I had heard more straight from my Dad. Now that he's gone, reading these books is the only way left to even try to understand what he endured."
4,The Humanity,"If he hasn't already received it, Stephen Ambrose should be awarded the Medal of Freedom. His body of work is a tribute to America, warts and all. ""Citizen Soldiers"" puts both John Wayne and Private Ryan in perspective. With the exception of a slowing of the pace to tell necessary and valid stories of types, the book takes you with it totally. America today may be prospering economically, but its heart is hurting. I'm a teacher, and every morning the pledge of allegiance is recited over the intercom and almost no one says it. I was born the first week of May 1945, and this is the closest I've come to understanding the true spirit of the American idea. ""Citizen Soldiers"" should be a required text in high school history classes. ""We"" is more important than ""me."""
5,This is the best book ever written about the WWII.,"It gives a true review of the whole situation from both the German and American sides, giving the good things as well as the bad things. The book is very well written."
3,A true historian lives and dies by correct dates,"I was very surprised, to say the least, that Mr. Ambrose and his editors, in making an analogy to the Battle of the Bulge, claimed that Washington crossed the Delaware on Christmas eve and attacked the garrison at Trenton on December 25 when in fact he crossed his army on Christmas night and attacked Trenton at approximately 8:00 a.m. on December 26.All historians live and die by correct dates.Otherwise a good quick read w/ some useful firsthand accounts albeit 55 years after the fact."
2,Not for the serious history buff...,"With a title like Citizen Soldiers I was expecting a book that described the experiences of the individual soldier in the ETO (something like The Deadly Brotherhood by John C. McManus)and lets you see the ETO as they saw it. Instead, I got a book that that focus's on the 12th Army Group (mainly 1st Army, 3rd is also mentioned, but in a secondary role to 1st Army, 9th gets some mention, and 7th barely exists) and attempts to bolster a rather weak analysis of the strategic view with the voices of veterans and snippets from other books. While this may not be bad for introducing people to WWII, I would suggest that those who are interested in the US soldiers exploits in WWII read Joseph Balkoski's Beyond the Beachhead or Gerald Astor's A Blood Dimmed Tide to understand what the citizen soldiers went through."
5,Outstanding; Different from All Others,"Ambrose gives something unique in this book. Even if you have read extensively on the Western Front in Europe, you haven't seen it from this perspective. It will surpise you, shock you, and otherwise hit your emotions because it is on such a personal level. If you have gotten far enough to read the reviews, you should buy the book."
4,Great Read,Nice companion to Band Of Brothers mini series. Characters were identical to those in series.This is a good read for any military buff or Airborne vet.
4,Easy reading - do not expect a history of WWII,"The book is based on countless interviews with ex GIs (and also with ex German soldiers!), who fought the war in Europe. It is therefore not a history of WWII (European war), and also not a history of the tactical military moves.Rather, it tells what the soldiers who were on the front lines experienced and thought. This is done in much detail - and unbiased: Not all GIs are heroes, not all Germans are villains.It also spells out clearly, where e.g. Eisenhower made mistakes which cost the lives of 100,000s of GIs.In my opinion the book puts too much emphasis on the glory of war and on heroism; the unspeakable atrocities of any war are not pointed out enough.All in all I can recommend this book to anyone interested in the subject the books talks about: What was going on on the front lines of this war."
3,"Author knows little, and could write better.","I was putting up with misspellings an grammatical errors and the now barely acceptable use of ""gauntlet"" meaning ""gantlet"", but ""shank mechanic"" (For giving out salt pills??!!) instead of ""chancre mechanic"" (Because the medics treated venereal disease.) was downright dumb.And, the maps were unreadable on my Kindle."
3,What were these soldiers like?,"Ambrose has written a book to honor the citizen soldiers who fought in the ETO. I am in awe of these ordinary men who did these extraordinary deeds, but what were they like? With few exceptions, little detail is given about the man inside the soldier. It's great military history, but it definitely lacks the personal touch of Cornelius Ryan."
3,Interesting daily life but lacking in tactical details,Mr. Ambrose's work gives a clear picture of the day to day live's of American Servicemen in post D-Day Europe. I was personnally disappointed in the lack of attention to tactics employed by US servicemen in the theater.
3,"Good, but ....","I should have enjoyed this more than I did. The stories are interesting, but I had the feeling I had heard them before. This is probably better for readers who are not familiar with WWII. American soldiers generally have been ""citizen soldiers"" who did the job in spite of politicians and generals."
5,Ambrose near the top of his game,Ambrose has done several of this books and after awhile you see that he does repeat himself now and then but this is such a powerful account of the regular soldiers view of WW2 that is should be mandatory reading for all.
5,good narrative,"I enjoyed this book. I felt it was repeating alittle,but that would be the nature of this type of book. It read well, and left me in awe several time. I enjoyed the immense amount of details.My grandfather landed at Normandy on D-Day + 2. I was amazed to read the landing beaches were under fire on the second day. I read that part and felt a deep connection, like I knew more now, and maybe understood my grandfather a little more. There were not many guys like my grandfather; he landed at the beach in the early days, and fought through France, and Low Countries, and into Germany. The amazing thing was the attrition rate; the loss rates were unrelenting for the Americans.Ambrose has his critics, but any historian would. The usually critism made is that they don't write their material, which maybe.All I can say is I enjoyed the book."
3,Good but lack of attention to detail,"Lots of good anecdotal stories. However, as others have said, there's a lack of attention to detail - references to locations not on maps, acronyms that are never defined."
3,Normandy Invasion,"This is a good book, light on the history. The book was easy to read and it adequately reflects the period of history under discussion. I found it valuable and entertaining."
3,Not a lot of Meat,"Although Ambrose does address a few touchy subjects, (like shooting prisoners) he's dancing around the topic and there's no analysis to speak of. Frankly put, Ambrose really hasn't written a good critical and fully balanced book in 15 years. Then again, he's rich, so he's got that going for him."
5,Phenomenal book,I read a brief review in the USA Today about this book and later spotted it at the bookstore. I thought I would just check out the prologue. THE PROLOGUE!! I couldn't put it down until I finished the d#@$ PROLOGUE! This book so vividly captures the moments of battle and survival of our soldiers in the ETO that it's almost as if I'm there or if these people are family! This book will be remembered as one of the most memorable books of our time.
5,Masterful,"Although I don't usually read science fiction, once I adjusted to the terminology of ""Time Shift"" by Phillip Ellis Jackson, I was hooked. Using real life drama, authentic sounding dialogue and believable action the reader is drawn into the midst of a thriller plot. The author's talented blend of murder, suspense and romance will keep you turning pages through to the apt ending. Science Fiction fans this is one you will definitely enjoy.Add ""Time Shift"" to your shopping cart, this well written narrative is a worthy read.Beverly J Scott author of Righteous Revenge"
4,A Fun Book,"This is a fun book that puts a new spin on time travel stories. Instead of bombarding us with incomprehensible techno-babble, the author focuses on the characters to make the book work. We come to know even the minor characters well (their foibles and all.) This isn't for the hard core science junkies, but it doesn't try to be, although the ""science"" is at least as believable as a Star Trek episode. I really enjoyed the beta light machine that works like a fiber optic device, transmitting sound and images through light."
4,A good start to a career,"A good book. The story started off a bit slow, and some of the back story was confusing. But the writing style was enough to get past that and after about fifty pages the book just took off. From then on the story was a great page turner."
5,Great pads!,"I am very pleased with the performance of these pads. These ceramic pads are the first I've used, and they work very well. I sense an improved stopping performance with absolutely no noise when the brakes are applied."
5,"Beautiful watch, well worth the money","I purchased this watch at Amazon after looking at it at a local mall. Amazon had the best price, and they shipped the watch with all the manufacturer's packaging. When they dropped the price, it was easy to get the price protection from Amazon. My experience with the after sales service has been excellent. The watch is beautiful and I am glad I have it in my collection."
5,very good watch,"tag heuer best known for his chronographs, its very good,has inside an ETA 7750.will last for a looong time, heavy,very good looking Wristwatch!"
5,Excellent watch,"I was looking through a magazine at the barber shop and saw an ad for this watch.Since I had been looking for this style of watch for several years, I looked it up on line.The price was reasonable and the watch is magnificent in quality and design.It will probably be the last watch I ever purchase."
4,tantric sex book....the good stuff!,"only flipped through the book, just by doing so, anyone can see how much the book can bring to the table, or shall i say bedroom... or any other confy space for love birds....These practices will not only improve sex life, but your everyday life. Some other commenter says ""its your own personal alchemy"".... Go there"
3,Not everything I hoped and dreamed of.,"I'm not sure what I was looking for, but this isn't it. I don't feel like this book will help my love life much, but parts of it were somewhat helpful."
3,Useful!,"A very basic but effectif way of changing your point of vue about this important aspecct of life, well written and easy to read, a very good introduction to this way of feeling better with sex"
2,not so great for an amp.,"When i used my amp for the first time, it was terrible. the sound is crappy, and i dont reccomment this at all. The only reason it gets 2 stars, s because the design, and nothing more."
1,poor quality,"A few days ago received this product and use it was detected that the connection to the AC does not work, only with battery. Do not buy it. low quality product"
5,Excellent Amp,The sound of this amplifier is very good and its small dimensions allows me to take it in my guitar case. Excellent return for my money
1,Disappointed in Sound Quality,"Having read the other reviews of this product, I was very hopeful I could use the Fender Mini '57 Twin-Amp for times when playing an electric guitar unplugged just doesn't cut. But after using it for an evening, I couldn't wait to return it - it sounded just awful at any volume level and tone setting. I would fully discourage anyone from buying this item for anything more than a nice desk top paper weight."
2,Not sure what the other reviewers were smoking,"OK, the tweed covering is nice. The whole thing seems like it was built to last, being a mini and all. That is the only reason this got two stars with me. I play an Epiphone G400 with some upgrades to it and this amp sounds like crap when I turn the volume anywhere past a quarter of the way up. The tone does not make much of a difference on this, the gain just makes the speakers break up faster. I am afraid of blowing the speakers on this out. On a better side of this, when I play with the headphones in it doesn't sound too bad. There is an awful amount of static that comes across the headphones. I've tried two different headphones and I still get the static feedback. I bought this thinking that I could use it to not bother my pregnant girlfriend, sadly it is almost completely unplayable. I will be returning this as soon as possible for a refund."
3,Too many errors,"I know Goldstein is considered a classic, but I've found a number of errors, and I don't mean typos. A few times, they'll take a statement of the form P=>Q and conclude that if Q, then P. (First instance on p 3... I've seen this in Marion, as well) and their treatment of the variation of the integral J is just wrong.Okay, there's a lot of very good stuff in here, but if you're a first time reader and, especially, if you lack confidence, I'd turn elsewhere."
2,Not so good...,"Well, I used this as a graduate Classical Dynamics course as a Physics student. The text is not very clear, very few examples, and sometimes it become too verbose. I do not like.I give it two start because it is still good as a reference.I liked Theoretical Mechanics of Particles and Continua more."
2,REALLY boring,"Theere are lots of fun books on classical mechanics, which is a beautiful subject. This is not one of them -- I found it eye-glazingly tedious as an undergraduate, and still do. For the aforementioned fun books, check out Landau and Lifschitz, or Sommerfeld, or (of course) Feynmann."
4,Good book if a little dated,There are more books on classical mechanics than there are students of the subject. Goldsteins book is one that just seems to of been around forever.Even though this was written in 1980 he has deliberatley avoided the 'modern' developments such as Abraham and Marsden and the towering genius of 20th century mechanics Arnold. This is no place for diffeomorphisms or invariant tori. Perhaps these days the best use for a book like Goldstein is to have it along side A&M to translate from the old language to the new and vice versa. At the end of each chapter there is a guide to other texts on the same or related topics. Very well written and very amusing.
3,Lack focus,"In my experience this book is alright when I took the course. In working environment, I found that it is not very useful. The reason is that it lacks organization and it presents not a single topic thouroughly and clearly, and thus I need to read other books that are more specialized.A friend of mine, who is very good in mathematics, agrees with me on this. To him, Mechanics by Symon is a much better book."
4,Still the standard for mechanics,"Even more then 30 years later, this book is still the standard in mechanics for graduate courses. Working through it will give an excellent understanding of mechanics. However, due to its age it falls a little short on some areas such as relativity. It woudl need an overhaul here. Yet, there is absolutely nothing wrong with it, so it should not be misunderstood here. What is needed here is an update on more recent developments in relativity and this is the primary reason why I couldn't give it a five star. Also, if one studies Goldstein first, then working on Jackson's Electrodynamics poses relatively little problems since the mathematical level is effectively the same as required in both books. Nevertheless, starting with Goldstein will be easier then with Jackson."
4,Essential purchase for Vivien Leigh fans,"I am so happy that Vivien Leigh movies (besides GWTW and A Street Car Named Desire) are finally coming out on DVD! Vivien is so well known for her Academy Award winning performances that her other numerous films are forgoten. These 4 films are from very early in her career. Fire Over England is perhaps the most recognizable, probably because she co-stars with Laurence Olivier. I think Storm in a Teacup is a cute movie co-starring a very young Rex Harrison. Dark Journey and The Sidewalks of London are darker films. This DVD is a great value."
3,Where's the BLACK Book of CAPITALISM????,"The research in this book is all well and good, but shouldn't we all CONSIDER THE SOURCE and his ideological motives? Many of the ""crimes"" discussed therein were the DIRECT result of aggression by Capitalist/Imperialist nations. I AM NOT defending communist regimes - I am just playing devil's advocate here. In addition, the author FAILS to mention the millions of anarchists that were killed by communists and of course no comparison with the MUCH MORE numerous and insidious crimes committed DAILY in the name of ""American Democracy"" and Capitalist profits is mentioned even in passing. You'd all be better off reading the works of Noam Chomsky, Subcommandante Marcos, and Murray Bookchin."
5,And there you are!,"If you'd like a complete explanation of how someone from Australia could read a book documenting the state execution of 100,000,000 people by a political movement and still think the movement is progressive, please buy this book."
4,THE BLACK BOOK OF COMMUNISM,"Excellent reference book on Communism. Taken from the files of the archives in Moscow after the fall of the USSR in 1989, scholars and researchers mined the documents and materials of the Soviet secret services, and other subordinate agencies, to put together a sad and horrific account of a Communist socialist's society's repressive and often deadly abuse of it's millions of people, recorded by the architects and bureaucrats of the society itself. If you ever thought about what it would be like to be a socialist or communist, I would strongly encourage you to read this book."
2,Moral of Story: Dad should do nothing but watch the tube...,"I can certainly understand how this book would heighten the insecurities of a child already unsure of his/her abilities. And I loathe--loathe!!--a book that suggests that watching television is constructive behavior in any context. Dad should watch TV to help his kid Leo read? Whhhhaaaat???I'm giving it more than one star because the illustrations are pleasant and I suppose the story might help some kids be more tolerant of ""late bloomers."" I would never buy this, though. We received the book as a gift, and, like another reviewer, I'm strongly tempted to toss this thing in the trash."
2,May delay a parent from getting their child help...,"I have a lot of problems with this book as do many of the parents that I know who have Special Needs Children. Many of us were given this book when we thought that our child might be delayed in some way by well meaning people as a way to reassure us. Some people might read this book and think that time alone will allow their child to catch up. Perhaps it well, but if the child really does have special needs, Early Intervention by experts is imperative. Often times Early Intervention by qualified Speech and Language Pathologists, Occupational Therapists, and Physical Therapists can correct problems that otherwise will be lifelong learning disabilities for the child. I fear that many parents reading this book may delay in getting their child the help that they need because they really want to believe that all will be well in time. I feel that this is not in the best interest of the child."
4,It's OK to be a late bloomer !,"The ideal storybook for children having difficulty coping with their maturity. This is the story of Leo, a lion that had a hard time reading,writing, getting along with friends. In his own right time, Leo does all the things his friends can do and more. There is hope for the late-blooming child. Leo is the inner child in all of us. Praise Leo for his gifts!"
5,My boys loved this book!,"C'mon people - really? Undiagnosed learning diabilities? Lazy dads? I don't see anything like that at all! Why do things have to be so complicated? having read this book at least a thousand times, it is memorized in my mind, and my boys' minds...the excitement of ""then one day in his own good time LEO BLOOMED!"" is just unparalleled....my boys' faces glowed with happiness every time we finished the book, and anticipation every time we opened the first page to read it. The drawings are colorful, the message sweet and to the point. Now my granddaughter is enjoying this well used, dog eared book too!"
2,bad portrayal of dads,"I hate how this book protrays the father, as an unattached lion who watches tv rather than helping his son bloom. I bought this book for my autistic son for Christmas, read it and put it in the trash. It makes Dads look uninvolved and is not a good portrayal at all. My husband is an excellent father and certianly would not choose to watch tv over helping my son learn.Very dissapointed in this book and honestly surprised by all these positive comments."
5,a kid's book for parents,"While Leo's Dad watches and waits for the blooming, Leo is learning and growing at his own pace. He will eat neatly when he is ready, and not one moment before. An important aspect is that Leo is not passive, he is depicted beautifully watching and playing and getting comfortable in his world. I recognize similarities in my own life and in my children as they grow. All that stuff kids do that isn't walking, isn't talking, isn't really drawing etc, is critically important to acquiring those skills, and sometimes it is hard for us parents to recognize this. But we need to recognize and participate in these essential preliminaries, I think especially for children who might be delayed and need our intervention."
4,My thoughts on Leo the late bloomer,"I like the story because it relates to delays and that, when the time is right, they can be overcome."
5,wish I had thought of that...,"Double the wit for your money! It's the arguments and conversations we've all been having, but with the lines and comebacks we wished we had thought of. Gene and Gina tap into the human experience and social questions of our post modern society... wait a minute... they do do that, but THE POINT OF THE BOOK IS THAT IT""S FUNNY! Everybody has had these conversations with the opposite sex -- just not with as much eloquence, style and wit. Good ammunition for the spousal debates."
5,"You don't think this is funny? Are you nuts, man?","If Dave Barry says a book is funny, I'm not going to argue--especially when the book made me laugh on every page. There's material here they could have taken straight out of my living room--except me and my lady ain't quite as amusing. But the writers here offer a view on what we all do without knowing why we do it. If we want to make our communication with the so-called opposite sex better, it starts by not taking ourselves too damn seriously. Read the chapter on whether you are a man or a woman (it's a quiz!) and TRY not to laugh. Impossible. This book shows us how laughing together works."
4,This musical got me hooked,"I saw Little Me in its pre-Broadway tryout in Philadelphia in 1962, at age 15, it was the first time I was ever in a theater, have been going for the past 46 years. I have great memories of Little Me, in spite of sitting in a cheap, balcony seat in a long-since demolished theater (the Erlanger),where I couldn't hear all the words (but at least what I did hear had a natural sound). Sid Caesar dominated, but all the supporting actors were good, especially Swen Swenson doing ""I've Got Your Number"". I have this only on an lp record, haven't heard it in a long time, but I still remember the music and lyrics. This is real theater history for me."
4,Little Me : a collector's item,"This Original Broadway Cast Recording album is a must for Broadway soundtrack collector's. Sid Caesar is simply remarkable, playing seven characters,giving each roles a unique touch. Swen Swanson is simply irrestible in ""I Got Your Number"""
4,Mancini the conductor in action!,"This set collects suites/medleys from some Mancini RCA albums released in the 1960s -- themes from assorted famous movies AND TV series, a few of 'em written by Hank M himself. This is the more schmaltzy side of Mancini (as opposed to his jazzier side), but it's still great fun, especially if you are old enough to recall and/or enjoy the richly elegant, classical music-flavored orchestral movie music from films from the 1940s - 1960s."
2,Hot Air,"To start with, I am a huge fan of the Shaara's. Loved to read and to re-read their books. This book looked promising and came highly rated. However, I considered this book to be overrated and boring. Contrary to what others wrote, the lack of punctuation alone drove me crazy. The book skips around so much that not only do you lose any perspective of what the author is supposed to be saying, but you don't get a chance to connect with anybody in the book. Having any type of punctuation could only have improved upon it. You are never sure when one person has stopped and another picked up, or even to when you have left one place to visit another. A book of this size and on this topic really needs a writer who is going to pull you in and allow you to ""feel"" what the players are feeling and thinking. By the time I was done, I wasn't even sure who I was. Anybody looking to buy this needs to look elsewhere as that is what I will be doing."
4,"Good, BUT...","For years I had wanted to read this, and when I finally got around to it, I was a little disappointed. On the positive side, Kantor creates characters who come alive and touch your heart. His attention to detail makes it possible to visualize seemingly every square inch of the camp, and many scenes depicting the horrors within are so emotionally powerful it becomes difficult to continue reading. However, the mountains of detail often become oppressive and interfere with the flow of the story. And because I found the writing rather awkward, I frequently had to reread sentences and entire paragraphs in order to fully grasp the meaning. The book is remarkable, but with some serious editing, it could have been a masterpiece."
4,"Mostly great, but some filler.","I thought the book captured a period of American History very well. The good parts, and there were many, were excellent. I thought it was better than ""The Killer Angels"" because it did a better job of evoking another time. I did think it could have used some pruning though. Some of the chapters (the one on the musician, for example) didn't seem to add anything to either the story or the mood."
5,PRIMUS,An excellent read. I read this book many years ago. Now I am purchasing one for my mentoree to read & learn about civil war history. If you want to sense the anguish of being a POW in a confederate prison you must read this book.
5,A Classic,I read this book many years ago when it was first published. My husband read a book on the Civil War and I told him I would try to find a copy so that he could read it...He never put it down. Andersonville tells a tale that you will never forget...and that both sides suffered immensely in this horrible war.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This is one of the worst books I've read. The first story was the best out of all of them. The third one, written by Fern Michaels, had grammar errors and the author even forgot that her character was her grandson and referred to him in one chapter as her nephew. This book might be for some people but it wasn't for me."
1,It just keeps getting worse,"I picked up this book as a nice distraction from holiday mahem at my house. Plus, it's been a while since I read a mindless romance novel. The first story provided MILD entertainment value, but I have to say that the second and third story get so bad I actually felt sorry for the authors. The story lines are weak and in some areas almost non-existent. The plots are predictable, and too much like other recent books I've read (the third story is just like Bridget Jones' Diary). It was so bad, I didn't even finish it and it's been YEARS since I didn't finish a book. Do yourself a favor and pass on this one..."
3,Beautiful pumps,"These shoes are beautiful however they are too narrow. I ordered 1/2 size larger based on another review and they are still tight. Beautiful shoes though, good quality too."
3,Runs small; order a larger size,"Beautiful shoe, but way too tight. Had to return and order a 1/2 size up and am hoping it will fit."
4,The Rage and the Pride,I have read this book and I found it quite interesting in describing why we are in such a global instability. The current political Middle East development had its origin in the 7th Century. Oriana has a sense of history and she describe it in her own writing. I am glad that someone is telling the truth about some European countriesstanding against the invading armies of terrorists.My only suggestion is that the book should have been transalted by a person with English as his mother language.
2,So So,"This book seemed like a great idea when I bought it in a moment of $@#. I spent some time reading it and it provided a point of view of the author and thats about it. My review for this book are that if you are looking for this particular subject area, then there are books available which would give you better kick."
5,Oriana made a few mistakes in the book,"Oriana Fallaci delivers a powerful, ""sermon"". The book is excellent. However, as a Nigerian, she made mention of a fervidly Nigerian drug trade in Italy, and if i understand correctly, she was of the impression that Nigerian drug trading was done by Nigerian Moslems. This is wrong! The bulk of the Nigerian drug trade is by Christians. The sons of Jesus are dealing drugs in Italy, not the sons of allah! The ""sermoon"" is full of well intended hate. It may be full of prejudice, but well reasoned!"
1,Out of the Choir,It is definetlely not a book that can help coexistence among people. The style is as always rather good and it is easy to read. But it shakes to the ground most of the convictions of a person who believes in the possibility of avoiding the famous clash of civilization.
1,Easy way to get Famous,"It seems to me like these days you write one book bashing Islam and you will get famous, because there are so many ignorants out there in the world. This is one such typical book.C'on we all can live peacefully and coexist. There is no sense in fighting over religion, this is 21'st century. Lets ignore people who create hatred such as this ignorant woman. Love people of all kinds & religion, God will love you.Spread hatred and God will punish you.See what happened to this ignorant woman. She got punished . Its good she wont write any more books. Thats God's way of saying "" Dont spread hatred""."
3,We Asked For More...,"Although Oriana Fallaci is probably best known for her polemical journalism of the 1970s, she is also only one of two people in the last several years to have the distinction of raising the pulse of the staff of ""The Economist"" to levels above a warm corpse (Naomi Klein is the other). Indeed, ""The Economist"" seemed bowled over by Ms. Fallaci's uncanny ability to give voice to the deep and not wholly unfounded fear and loathing many in the Western world feel for fundamentalist Islam. However, ""The Rage and the Pride"" leaves such people begging for more. Ms. Fallaci spreads her venom too thin and spits it at far too many sitting ducks (Berlusconi, et al). One might have hoped that Ms. Fallaci, as she so often did in the past, would have hissed what the apologists of Islamic terrorism dare not."
5,brutal,Imagine if you had a neighbor with a huge wart. Good manners decries that you ignore it. Ms. Fallaci doesn't. In Rage and Pride she points out that there is a wart on the neighbor's face and proceeds to describe how big and ugly is and notes that it's growing. In other words this fire breathing little book is not polite much less politically correct. Is Ms. Fallaci a latter day Cassandra speaking the truth to unwilling listeners? You'll have to decide for yourself. All I can say is that this is a volcanic little book. I couldn't stop reading it until I came to the last page.
5,Aim. Fire. Direct hit.,"This is the written word that many of us who lived in the Middle East saw, heard and felt every day, but could not say becauase we feared torture. Ms. Fallaci has been in the same countries and seen the same fear. Now in America, she has taken the challenge to speak a harsh truth about the direction of hate and those who yield that hate. Now that I no longer live in that fear, I use words like Ms. Fallaci's to bolster the courage to change my world and the lives of those around me. You don't have to follow this book blindly, but you can derive simple truths that you can implement in your daily life. Read this and change your lives too. Or those who hate us will change it for us."
3,Half the Story,The author nails fundamentalist Islam but misses the bigger point. All fundamentalist religions believe their view is correct and endorsed by God and therefore tend to think themselves entitled to impose their will on others. Abortion clinic bombers and those who would deny fundamental rights to gays and lesbians are cut from the same cloth as those who think that Allah has determined the a narrow version of Islam should triumph. Falwell and Pat Robertson are not bin Laden but they would both use the state to impose their religious ideology on the rest of us. In Afghanistan people with a similar goal were called Taliban.
1,Unfortunate,"It's unfortunate that the author chose to write this ""sermon"". I give it one star only out of respect for her. The book has no redeeming qualities. Although I agree with her that the Islamic fundamentalist movement is a grave issue, the book does nothing to add to that opinion. It is a personal recounting of many injustices done to her laced with her disgust for European politicians, the Pope, the majority of Italians, Jane Fonda,etc. Skip it."
3,"great on the concepts, poor in the presentation","Fallaci has the courage to say what too many are thinking, but are afraid of saying. Her personal first hand knowledge of Muslims in their own part of the world, and her direct observation of the effects Arab immigration have wrought on her native country (filthy cities, a rise in crime), needed only 9/11 as a catalyst to coalesce into a book like this one.In the book she tells what many of us in the Western world deep down know but still refuse to accept: that Islam is at war with the West. Most of Islam, not just a few fanatics; and most of the West, not just America.Fallaci makes one mistake in the version of the book for sale in America, and that is insisting on translating it from her native Italian herself. The English is by and large correct, but the syntax is Italian and the result comes out stilted, a bit hysterical and weird sounding. This detracts significantly from the impact of this work. But overall, it should be required reading."
1,The Rage and The Pride,"I have been a fan of Oriana for the last 30 years. Her objectivity, fairness and compassion has impressed me when reporting on Vietnam, Mexico City, her interviews with History, her letter to a child never born.However The Rage and the Pride deeply disappointed me. It seems to me that Oriana in her age has lost her valleys of understanding, compassion and objectivity and is living in the peaks of irrational and passionate hate. I am very sorry to see that one of the great and most excellent journalists of our times has decided to let herself fall into the abysm of rage and pride."
1,Laughable,This book was replete with errors and fantasies galore! the poor lady seems obsessed with this idea of hordes of savages raging through her beloved city and destroying it.The work contained many factual errors and was reminscent of the theory of Jewish conspiracy theories that were found in the early half of the 20th century (especially the comparison of a religious group of people to rats).The idea that a group of humans numbering 1.3 billion cannot be so monolithic seems lost on the author.Sadly she helps the cause she professes to loathe. It's precisely this type of work which has extremists licking their lips telling recruits this is what the West thinks of you and acts as more recruiting propoganda.
2,"From what I've seen so far, lack of facts...","Read the Wall Street Journal excerpts and not very impressed with it. I think the time has arrived that the war had started and plenty of informations have been floating around the internet, one could easily varify things which she claimed as true- arn't so true, and she seems grossly unaware of many. If Fallaci actually checked out some declassified documents of the US regime, including CIA's covert ops in her own country after the WW2 (plans to interfere with democratic election, etc), she won't be such a US lover. Most of the arguments around her support for war seems emotional, based on flawed inductions from things worth little factual value. One can seriously undermine her book after reading Chomsky and doing some personal research. I am confident to write a book of my own countering everything she said in the excerpt, based on the documents I've researched lately. So can you, if you make the effort to truth."
2,full of incoherent rage,"Fallaci is one angry woman. Sadly, she does not here display the writing skill, the organization, or the preparation to take a solid swing at this.Oh, I agree with most of what Fallaci writes here; it's just that this particular book is not worth your time. It was obviously too hastily written, it suffers from an irritatingly self-important style (e.g., the author's constantly referring to the reader as ""you"" and ""my dear""), and it features a unnecessarily huge introduction.The thing is also swiss-cheesed with intrusively awful English. It certainly wasn't translated. Did she write it overnight?Now that I think about it, the book, ironically enough, has a good deal in common with Arabic rhetoric!For a much more coherent and useful treatment of the same problems, consult Robert Spencer's ""Islam Unveiled."""
1,History unchanged,"In the Name of Allah, most Gracious most MercifullIt is always repeated that Oriana Fallaci set forth an arguement or a statement, something that can be built upon and this is very contrary to the truth.Her words are insulting, generalizing and simply summoning up what Millions of people around the world feel. Muslim are women beaters, savages, polyagamists, terrorists and bearded fanatics.The only difference with her is that she did not even bother to present it in a way which is acceptable, in simple writers standards.It is full of Historic errors, Prejiduced statements, and emotional unrational, even personal attacks.Her describtion of Western Civilization as the contrary to the savage and backward mentality of Islam is so outrageous and tremendously ignorant that only the most naive headnodders will follow her.The Democracy of the West is not a result of its enlightenment, but of a long perioed of Wars, suffering, torture and pillage...."
5,Oriana rules!,"she has more courage than many european men, and simply doesn't want Italy to end up like france. God Bless her!!!"
2,Find Another Book,"Morgan's style frequently slips from casual to chatty, at the expense of the reader's time and patience. She is often uninformative, dismissive, and favors the trivial over the essential. After reading it, I do know more about Eastern philosophy than I did before, but there must be better books on the subject."
5,The Cat and the bird in the hat,"I like this book because the cat finds a hat.But what he does not know is that a bird lives in the hat.The bird does not like te cat wearing his home.Soon they get to know each other. Then they become friends and have lots of fun adventures. I really like the end of the book. I also like the second adventure, it is very cool....I got this book 2 years ago.It is my favorite book that I have."
4,Apple zap!,"I was a little disappointed it didn't taste as apple-y as it could have, but it still has a great flavor! I really liked it! I think the watermelon flavor is way better though :D"
4,Candy flavored goodness!,"As with most lubes, you want to be careful what you pick! Some can taste pretty bad, others are very good!This is a definite must buy if you like things that are sweet and sensual!My husband loves this one ^_-It doesn't taste like artificial watermelon so much as it just tastes like a lovely sweet candy :-)"
2,Frustration->Elation->Disappointment,"I struggled with one of the bottles for three days before giving up and going back to using an EvelFlo slow nipple with liners. At first my 3 week old son was highly frustrated not being able to get milk at a rate which he had gotten used to. After 4 feeding, he decided to slow down and play the bottle's game, and this is when I was elated. But after a couple of feedings like that, he simply refused to spend nearly 5 times longer to feed than he was used to. By the time he sucked a couple of ounces, over 1/2 hour would pass. I tried making the nipples hole a little larger by making a tiny slice in the silicon, and this did improve things, but in the end, even the nipple's shape was not to his liking. I got this because others had claimed that it would reduce colic and burping, but when the baby is completely frustrated and does not eat, colic is the last worry you have."
5,Gifted and illuminating charts visualising Scripture,"Larkin, a gifted draftsman, has produced a marvelous work illuminating the Holy Scriptures. Prophecy is a major theme with the books of Daniel and Revelation being key - wonderful clarity being afforded to each. Larkin is pre-tribulationalist, pre-millenianist and (obviously) dispensationalist. A must for any prophetic student!"
3,Average.,"I thought there would be more to this tape than the commercial, but was wrong. What you see on the commercial is what you get. The rest of the video is commentaries and Darrin talking. The thing I dont like about this video is that Darrin teaches you the moves while facing you. That was a little difficult for me considering that when he does a move with his left, turn left and kicks left facing you, you have to do it all with your right, which was a little confusing for me. Other than that, it's ok."
2,Fair Movie.,"Okay, I guess. He just teaches you how to dance and move around. That's it. Weird, huh?Rating: NR (Not Rated) Made For TV."
1,It was ok.,"When I watched this video, I tried to follow along with the dance moves but he goes too fast. Some of the dance moves he doen't even explain!! He expects you to do it all at once without stoping. It is very confusing. I don't reccomend this movie."
3,"Cool Dances, but A Few Complaints","The dances are cool, but there are a couple times where you can't tell what his feet are doing because the camera angle is from the waist up. Even on the replay the camera still doesn't show his feet (on bye bye bye).One other problem is that it is kinda hard to learn it opposite of him. He instructs facing the camera and there is no one who is facing backwards, so anyone watching the tape and learning the dance has to go the opposite direction as he goes to do it right.Plus he doesn't teach you the whole song. For example on Bye Bye Bye he only shows you the first verse and the chorus. But after you learn it the dances are cool.I would still recommend this dvd and i haven't been able to find another hip hop instructional video that is as good as Darrin's."
3,This was okay...,"My friend and I were learning a lot of the nsync dances off of the New York Times Square video and we were doing really well and knew most of it down. But there were these few parts we didn't have because the camera panned the audience. So, we bought Darrin's Dance Grooves, or I should say, I got it for Christmas. We were really excited because that meant we had the rest of the moves we needed. But in practicing it, Darrin only does HALF of the song, he doesn't do the whole song. So we were greatly disappointed in it. He also does't go really slow. He goes slow, but not slow enough. I found we had to rewind the tape a few times to figure it out.If you just want to learn to dance, then this is a great video to get. But if you want to learn the dance steps to a WHOLE song, this isn't for you, unless you want at least half the song to get you started."
1,WAIT... DON'T BUY IT,"I only feel it fair to warn you that you're paying for a movie that will teach you 4 dances... which are alright dances, but incredibly hard to learn.Just my opinion.Later.~me"
1,This is NOT how you learn to dance,"This is a ""I""M DARRIN, LOOK AT ME VIDEO"". There is little dancing and you can't learn what dance is on the tape. I found out about ""Groovin With The Groovaloos"" videos and THAT is how you learn how to dance! These dancers are amazing and the teaching on the tape is just what I was looking for. It's a group that has their own website too, www.groovaloos.com. You can order the videos off their site. If you want to learn streetdancing stuff like breaking, popping, locking, and hip hop, YOU MUST GROOVE WITH THE GROOVALOOS!!!!!!"
2,Hard,"This video is extremely hard. They claim that they break it down but when they go back over it with you, they show video clips of the moves and not of the whole body. I don't recommend this video and think the moves are bad..."
2,Fun But Opposite,"This is very fast paced with funky camera movements (not 'instructional-friendly'). The biggest turn-off for me was that you have to move 'opposite' of what you see in screen because they are 'facing you' and doing their 'right/left' moves. I am used to seeing the instructors in my other workout video move in 'mirror opposite'... Each little move take a good load of patience to learn, so you will end up pausing the video most of the time. Fun moves though, and gives you a sense of 'accomplishment' when you finally get to dance the routine."
4,Darrin's dances rok,We loved this video. We learned to dance like the proffesionals ! We saw the comercial on tv and we knew we had to have it ! When the video came we popped it in the vcr and started dancing. He taught us sooooo much !!! Thanks Darrin !
4,"Go, Darrin! Go, Darrin! Go! Go! Go, Darrin!","Finally! A video that teaches me all of those fresh dance moves that I see on MTV every day. Now I can pretend to be cool like all of those pop stars! The best part about this video is that I can learn at my own pace. Darrin was nice enough to break it down for me into fast, easy-to-learn steps.I think it's great that Darrin took time out of his busy schedule to make this video. His choreography is TIGHT! After learning all of these phat moves, I actually feel like I'm a member of *NSYNC, or a back-up dancer for Britney Spears, or an extra on the set of ""Breakin' 3: Electric Boogaloo 2"".Don't expect to learn these rad dance moves over night, you'll really need to work at it. I practiced for two hours every day after school, and it still took me a month to learn Darrin's exciting ""pop n' lock"" routine. Now all the ladies think I'm foxy!I can't wait until I find a practical use for all of these awesome new dance moves I've learned!"
2,Zooger10000,"Nice Try.But no go.If your a advanced hip hop dancer this tape will be 7th heaven,if your not well,DO NOT BUY THIS TAPE!!...Darren is facing TORWARD you the entire time!!He goes too quicktoo fast.So take my advice:Don't waste your money!!!.."
3,Not for Beginners,"This is a fun video to watch and it has a good message. But its NOT as easy as ""1,2,3"". I teach some of these same moves to my students and we have to take a great deal of time with each element of the more complex steps. This video is great if you can already dance this style and just want to learn some new moves. But it will be very dissapointing for someone who has never tried this before. I have it in DVD and that allows me to review and slow down the action much easier than you could with VHS. Still, it is challenging. Worth having, but not as a first instructional. Also, it is a bit dated by todays standards. But still fun."
1,Just Confusing - Left? Right? Huh?,"Unlike every other dance class I've attended - where the instructor stands with his/her back to the class...or every workout video I've watched - where the instructor uses left to be on the same side as the exerciser's right and calls ""right""...Darrin doesn't do either. He stands forward to the camera and announces HIS left and HIS right leaving you to have to do the mental adjustment. It would have been much better if they had put a split screen with camera angles from front and back. I agree with the comment that this is just all about celebrating Darrin - not really how to learn his dance grooves effectively."
2,Not for beginners & does not live up to hype,"I bought this video b/c of the commericals promoting it. First off, he goes too fast & he cannot instruct people who are beginners. He needs to go to the right when the audience goes to the right, he does not do that. Also, he does not show the whole dance to each song. He is very skilled, but he is not very verbal in explaining how to move when he moves. Also, the camera angles stink. I think that they should show you the whole body at all times, sometimes Darrin is talking about moving his feet when you cannot see his feet! He does not seem very personable and it is not very exciting & enjoyable to watch the video, esp. discouraging beginning dancers. I could hardly follow him, if not at all. I would recommend Fatima's video which is more aimed towards beginners, although she does not show the whole video dance either."
3,"hm, it's ok...","the video isn't bad, but this guy does love to talk about himself for quite a bit, meaning this waste up time on the tape. if u have experience with dance, such as ballet, jazz, hip hop, etc you should have an easier time following him. for beginners, the camera will probably annoy u as it's shot from the front and not always focused on the feet. so you have to do everything the opposite what he does and have to watch some of the backup dancers for their feet movement. also, he does each portion twice and sometimes he goes a bit too fast. so be prepared to do a lot of rewinding and practicing, especially before he takes you to a fast beat with the real song. but this is a pretty fun video and give you insight on how much practice the singers goes thru."
4,Not So Bad,"This video is not so bad.The only problem is that you have to rewind it alot till you have the dance movrd memorized.I would recommand this video or DVD to dancers who have some experience. In my opinion,the vidoe of DVD should be a little slower with the choregraphy and have longer minutes and more dance moves."
1,Waste of time and money,"I've been dancing for about 6 years and consider myself to be a fairly good dancer. But this tape offered little to no help. Not only were the rather large female backround dancers annoying they were also discusting. Darrin's feet were cut out of most of the video so you really have no idea what they are doing down there. Another annoying feature were the interviews that graced this dvd. Darrin said that he didn't choose dancing, dancing chose him........well Darrin I'm afraid dancing made a wrong choice. Kiddies don't waste your money!"
3,I thought it would be really cool,I thought it would be a really great video cause it looked cool on TV but i read some reviews and stuff and also the Hip Hop Shop had a lot better reviews too so i haven't seen the video but i would probably get the Hip Hop Shop if i were you.
2,Not enough Breakdown,"I got this DVD a few years ago. There is no music playing while he teaches, he only show 5 moves at a time, no breakdown other then to day 1 and 2 and 3 and..., he would never call out the move before you did it, so the first time you'd have NO clue what was next, he would do it 1/2 time 2x, then on the next 5 moves & would go through all 30+ moves before doing the whole thing 1 time at 1/2 speed then with music full speed with video playing.Only a few moves throughout the whole routine would he give a second instruction on minute hand gestures. He never broke down the footwork, the camera would be zoomed at their faces, hardly ever at the feet.The moves are decent, the backup 3 guys & about 5 girls seemed nice, Darrin seems nice, the extra pop/locking tiny routine with him & 2 guys is cool but your Rew button will get rubbed down. There are plenty of better dance workout DVDs out there.There's a trailer at collagevideo com"
1,TERRIBLE,"I have to say, I was totally stoked when I ordered this awful video...it looked like so much fun! Well, I watched it once and gave up on it. First of all, whoever mentioned that he was confusing about distinguising his left to your left was totally right....i couldn't follow the moves at all! And this whole video was so narcisstic-it was Darren promoting himself for 3/4 of it! Total waste of money. PLEASE don't buy it!"
3,Not so easy!,"I bought this video for my 10 year old daughter who really likes N*SYNC. She was a little disappointed that Darrin only shows you how to do the ""chorus"" part of routines. I knew from the reviews that Darrin would be performing this facing you but didn't realize how difficult it would be to try imitate him when he's moving one way and you're suppose to be moving the other way! I think it would have been better if Darrin had been facing the camera but had his dance team doing the steps with their backs to the camera so you could follow them. And yes, you can pause and rewind the video but how do you try to dance with a remote in your hand? It's a lot harder than you think. Those who have taken dance lessons, and are used to doing the opposie of their teacher, probably won't have a problem. But not so easy for beginners or their Mom's! ;-)"
1,Darrin u 2 be bad,"The video seriously disappointed me. I love working out to dance work out videos, but this has been the worst. I like to to dance, but it takes a comprehensive break down of each 8 count for me and then practice at the normal beat of each 8 count before I can move one to a new set. If you are like that too, I recommend getting something else before buying this one. I do recommend Paula Abdul's Get up and Dance. She breaks down each 8 count and then practices each 8 count up to tempo before moving on. It is challenging and yet completely doable and offers a great way to sweat off some calories, whereas with Darrin's Dance Grooves, I didn't feel any real calorie burning sweat at all."
5,A review from an [age] year old girl,This is a great DVD even if u cant dance fast Darrin goes slow so you can keep up and learn.If you think you are not good dancer this is a good DVD for you because it will teach you all the coolest steps and you will look like a professional in no time.Also if you want to learn the stars' moves it is great too.If you practice with the movie you will soon be able to do it in a snap.I reccomend it to anyone that want to learn some cool dances or needs to brush up on dancing.It is an awesome DVD!
2,Darrin's Dance Grooves,"Basically, this instructional video is poorly shot. I agree with Amazon's review about having to reverse the ""right"" and ""left"" directions. It is a little confusing. It also does not help that the camera seems to be on a slight angle. Many times it is also in so close you can't see feet when he's telling you to step. I've been a dancer for 20 years and was too frustrated to finish the video."
2,VHS Review,"the VHS was listed as new on amazon, but was used and recovered with plastic. The movie was obviously used."
3,Great Popping and Locking Routine,Most of the choreography on this DVD is lackluster and uninspiring. But there's a great--and very simple--popping/locking routine at the end. It's very different from everything else on this DVD. And there are some brief but helpful technique points at the end of the DVD.
1,BIGGEST WASTE OF YOUR HARD EARNED CASH!!,"i hated it!! darrin promises you'll be able to dance like all the stars....yeah right. it is so difficult to follow!! the camera angles are horrible..and you always have to watch it over and over and over again until you think you've got it down. the tape also has parts in between dances where darrin talks about his life. if i wanted a biography..i would've wasted my money on sumthin else!!! the commercials for this item are very tricky. when i bought it..i thought they'd teach you the whole dance, when in reality..the dance turns out to be about 15 seconds of the song. he then goes through the tape really fast, and then when you get to try the dance to the music..its practically impossible. its not a good workout either. i got it last year, and the only thing it does now is collect dust...DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!"
2,Nothing that I expected,"A friend and I got Darrin's in extreme anticipation.Not only is Darrin sexist (he believes that women are unable to do ""normal"" pushups) but everything about this video is unsatisfying.The warm up was counted too slowly and the begining of the video consisted of stars claiming ""Darrin is the best"", complete with his life history.You don't see the dancers feet, therefore you are left to guess what to do. He gives you the first move of a sequence, then goes through the sequence without breaking it up first. He doesnt even tell you how fast you will do it in the ""real thing""Since Darrin is facing you, it is extremely confusing from your rights and your lefts.However, the moves are fun and simple, but it would help a lot if they were broken down first."
1,"FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DON'T BUY IT!!",I can review this tape in just ONE word...TERRIBLE...that's all you need to know.
4,Good video but painful,"Yes, you get to do some of the moves from the hottest videos but frankly the ""bye - bye - bye"" move and others like really are not worth learning. However at the end he teaches some awesome dance moves that are just for the tape which makes up for all the boring useless stuff. He should have just had more of that. The video also has tons of ""filler"" material where you are not learning anything, and the camera angles suck (he'll describe legwork, while he's doing it, but it will be a shot of his face). The camera angles get better as the video progresses. Hard to watch."
3,Its OK,"This video was okay. I am a teen and was hoping to learn some cool dance moves. The video goes slightly fast, but you can always rewind. They usually only show you the chorus part of the song and there are inly 4 songs on here. It is hard to always remember that you have to do the opposite side of what he is doing."
3,If You're A Dancer--It's Worth It,"A friend of mine gave me this video because everywhere I went, I was dancing, with or without music. When I started teaching Funk aerobics, I needed new moves and pulled out this video to try it out. I have to admit, I found myself liking it, but if it weren't for the wonderful invention of the rewind button, I would probably be lost on the video. The camera angles are terrible and it is extremely fast paced. Darrin isn't the most engaging talker in the world either. However, when you get the hang of the moves (after rewinding and rewinding and rewinding some more), it's pretty fun to just break it out. If you love to dance and want something to just do, it's worth getting, but be ready for some tedious rewinding in order to learn the moves."
2,Too fast paced for a beginner,"I was disappointed that many times the camera angle would shift and not show Darrin's feet. I found this to be very distracting when I'm trying hard to watch his every move and then all of a sudden I don't see how his feet are moving anymore! One of the moves being shown showed him spinning around one time a full circle, but no emphasis was given to show the correct way to spin so that your feet end up in the correct position at the end of the spin. I wouldn't recommend this for a beginner."
3,Cells that are robots that join to form anything...,"So, it may not be the best story ever written, but it does carry on the Asimov Robots storyline. If you can quote the three laws of robotics, you gotta read this whole series. It will not knock your socks off or anything, but you will enjoy it."
4,Shape changing robot,"I though this book was interesting because of a robot that can manipulate its body and obeys the three laws of robotics very loosly. Also I love any book that deals with Isaac Asimov's ideas. I suggest if you like this book you should read also I, Robot a collection of short stories dealling with robots and the three laws of robotics."
3,an okay book for me,"This again was a bit violent for me, but I did enjoy it. Am on a mission to read all the Alex Cross novels."
4,Great Album,"I first got the vinyl version in 1976 - one of the first jazz records I owned. I am happy to be able to buy it on CD. The combination of Cleo and her husband, John Dankworth (sp), is great."
3,OK - Not really good for reading,My son loves firetrucks which is why I got this book. It is ok - the words to read don't really work out well - it lends better to the song it comes with. He likes to look at the firetruck pictures though - I make up my own little story for it now!
5,Purchased for a Mr. Potato Head party..,We had a Mr. Potato Head party at work for someone and we each bought a different character. This one had to be one of the cutest!
4,"¿por qué le apodan El Canario""?","No es el mejor disco de José Alberto, ni mucho menos,pero encierra una obra maestra de la música bailable ...""Que paren el reloj, que suban esa música, que bajen esa luz que quiero bailar contigo"". No podrás impedir que tus pies se pongan a bailar.Se me olvidaba ...¿por qué le llaman El Canario? Pues no lo sé, pero le vi una vez en concierto y silbaba como si fuera un canario ¿será por eso?"
5,Unbiased and Real,"This is a great book for a better understanding of herbal medicine, as a medicine. My favorite feature of this book is the fact that the author makes it abundantly clear that herbals can be just as potent and therefore dangerous as pharmaceuticals. Why do I like this point so much? Because it's the truth; unlike some other books that try to lead you to believe that herbals are somehow safer. This book gives the reader just the facts, good and bad about herbals, thereby allowing you the opportunity to a real and unbiased approach to alternative medicine, and help to make INFORMED decisions."
5,The best book ever written on early Anarctic exploration,"I mean early, early exploration. Gurney is great at mixing the technical with the storytelling. I found myself inextricably drawn in; the book is much too short. Given the idea that any information at all exists from these old sea voyages makes it more incredible for its detail. I've read far more than my share on Antarctic exploration; if you like the minutiae of acquiring a navigational fix on the open sea, why it's called the convergence, why almost everything about not only Anarctica but the southern latitudes is so weird, and why Scott and Amundsen stood on the shoulders of giants, check this one out."
5,"Detailed, gripping reading","In an age where the entire planet hads been mapped from space it's hard to realize that there was a time, not that long ago, when the existence of a Southern continent was still a matter of speculation and doubt. Gurney's book beins with voyages of the Dutch East India company, skirting the South polar regions around the beginning of the 17th century and ends with the complete maping of the coast of Antarctica in the mid-19th. Along the way are detailed stories not only of the early polar explorers, but scores of detailed asides on such diverse topics as the food and other provisions used by sailors, the problem of scurvy, the history of the rum ration, and the story of John Harrsion and his clocks that made detailed navigation and mapping possible. An excellent choice for fans of sailing, history, discovery or geography."
5,returning items,This is not the right model for 2000 and 2001 Toyota corolla. I returned the items and got my money back with no hassles. Great customer service and definitely stick to Amazon.
4,Zoinks! It's a Zombie.,"Scooby and company are going camping at Treasure Bend, a campsite famous for it's old mines and supposedly buried treasure. Business is slow so the gang can camp in the prime locale. However, rumors of a golddigger's zombie leave Scoob and Shaggy just a little uneasy. Then they meet the creature face to face. Jeepers creepers! But an unexpected accident leads Velma and Fred to suspect that the zombie isn't what he seems.Breaking away from the usual Scooby-Doo formula this story had a couple of unexpected twists (e.g. Daphne's disappearance). I also enjoyed the character of Panther Jack. It would be neat to see him in another story sometime. Overall, a book that children and fans of Scooby-Doo will probably love."
5,Delightful Tale of Female Independence,"This is a delightful tale of female independence. The mainstream typically views Arab Women as oppressed, and this tale demonstrates that many of them had a significant role in many of the independent movements. It is a short read."
2,Least Favorite of Books on Empire State Building,"I read through some books on the Empire State Building with my children (ages 2-9). This was my least favorite. The story includes very little on the building of the Empire State Building. This book seems to be more focused on including stereotypical information about the Mohawks -- which felt quite contrived. The boy telling the story is a Mohawk Native American living on a reservation, and his father is working on building the Empire State Building. When the father isn't working on that, he's repairing longhouses. The boy's mother works on beading items each night. The characters have names like ""John Cloud"" and ""Joe Eagle."" The boy listens to Mother Earth and Father Sky talk to him as he climbs a tree.Sky Boys: How They Built the Empire State Buildingis a much better option if you're looking for a story book on the Empire State Building."
5,Salsa!,"This is really one of the best albums I have. There's not a single song I don't like, every one makes me want to dance. I've been listening to salsa my whole life, and I've never heard an album that could beat this one. This is classic salsa, straight from Puetro Rico, the kind of stuff they played on the radio when I was a kid. I can't say enough about this album really. Just get it and dance the night away."
4,mefisto,"I found mefisto to be an excellent book,i particularly enjoyed the relationships between the folks at the Ashburn mansion. Felix who remains enigmatic thruought the novel is one of the most extrordinary characters ever to be woven by banville although you might already be familiar with him (ghosts) this book holds new insights into his peculiar psyche.if you are already a fan of banvilles or if you are looking for a truly excellent novel I would highly recomend this literary piece."
4,some stunning description,Really nice book with some deeply evocative language. Banville says so much with such economy of phrase. Great stuff.
3,Not a how-to manual :(,"An interesting book about the author's experience with integrated play groups, but I was hoping for more of a how-to about setting up such playdates/groups myself with my mildly autistic son and typically developing kids around the neighborhood, etc...There are only three case studies too, making this book more valuable to teachers than parents, because if your child isn't similar to one of the three cases, then the book won't be as relevant."
5,Best bird feeder yet,"I purchased this feeder as an addition to another of the same style I've owned for the past 2 years. These feeders with their stainless steel mesh and non-ferrous metal painted tops and bottoms are very durable. Over the past 2 years in constant exposure to the elements, I've only noticed some fading of the paint, but of course no rust. The only thing I've added was a couple of perches protruding at right angles to each other through the mesh. I made them out of #8 stainless steel threaded stock and secured them with the appropriate sized stainless hex nuts. I really recommend these feeders; I've always got lots of customers feeding on the perches."
1,Princeton Review needs to reevaluate this edition!,"I am preparing for the August MCAT and can no longer continue to use this book. There are indeed errors throughout the 4th edition. And the paper that it is printed on is weak and low quality. As you study about blood pressure, you might feel yours rise dangerously due to this book's inability to present the material as clear as it is advertised."
1,An Embarrassment to Princeton Review,"I can no longer trust this book. At first I thought it was just accidental deletions and sloppy editing, but the outright conceptual mistakes in the subject matter make me wonder about who was writing some of it. It's truly hard to believe that Princeton Review would put out something of this quality but it looks like I'll have to shell out another 60 bucks on a different book. I want my money back!"
2,Decent but not great.,"This book explains materials very well and the multiple choice questions are good.However, there are many mistakes especially in orgo. I also found that some topics were completely omitted(like blood groups in Biology)and many other things. The verbal questions were too easy and insufficient"
2,Beware of errors and typos,There are misakes sprinkled throughout the Organic Chemistry section of the book. The Kaplan Version seems to have better editors.
1,This book will probably decrease your MCAT score!,"PLease, do not make the same mistake I did, that is, buying this book 3 weeks before the MCAT to study. This book is inaccurate in many areas at best and insulting to one's intellegence at worst. It only covers about 75-80% of the material you need to know! Unacceptable if you are relying on this for a comprehensive study. Stay away from this one!"
4,His solo debut set.,"Johnny Rivera's solo debut CD was a better-than-average Salsa Romantica set. Unlike most of his contemporaries, Mr. Rivera comes through as a singer full of honesty and conviction. Yes, this is romantic music but it is by no means sex-drenched and it's definitely well-suited to an artist of Mr. Rivera's calibre."
5,Hot hot hot shoes!,"These shoes are the hottest! So perfect for holiday parties. They look great with jeans or dresses, brown or black or teal... They are a little narrow for my wide feet, but can be stretched as they have leather uppers. I did end up finding the same shoes at the BCBG outlet for $19 so I returned these and saved nearly $100 when you factor in shipping."
1,Avoid at all costs.................,"If your a shoe salesman and you want to sell shoes the rest of your life, this is the book for you! The key message of this book could have been told to you in a simple 3 page essay. After this authors 1st book, it has been all down hill. He should take his own advice to network himself into another career that doesn't involve advice. THATS HOW HE CAN SHOW HIS ""LIFE LONG COMMITTMENT"" TO HIS READERS AS HE SUGGESTS OTHERS TO DO TO AN INDUSTRY. It was truly unreadable. I can't even sell it used with a clear conscious.The experience in summary: Imagine, your trying to eat lunch quietly and the banter of two people talking louder than they should be are right next to you. If that is considered a positive experience, than buy multiple copies of this book for your library."
3,good stories bad editing,"I watched the house that screamed a long time ago I think its a great story and if it was remade I personally think it would be a good idea. lately for the past few years their has not been a movie (Horror) movie that I have liked I can't remember the last time I watched a good scary movie at the movies I remember walking out while watching Dracula 2000 such a boring movie.I liked Maneater of hydra I think of it more of a sci fi/horror film the two movies are good but what bothered me was the editing, their were pauses on both movies as if a comercial was next I didn't like that and it distracted me ,but all in all I enjoyed both movies but The house that screamed will always be one of my favorite movies.If I was a movie Producer I would make that movie again. I made a mistake rating 3 stars this is a 5 star."
1,maneater of hydra,the box was broken(post office may be?)!and the picture very very bad!i think you can t again to sell this product!i am disappointed!the other film is just correct!(the house that screamed)
4,Cute Concept - Not Much Substance,"I thought this was such a cute concept, but when I actually opened it, I was disappointed. The packaging from the seller was sweet, but the necklace itself was on a card, no box. It's a super, tiny charm on a flimsy silk thread. I feel it's way over-priced. I was actually a bit embarrassed to give this as a gift and ended up picking up a few handmade soaps to give alongside."
5,Fantastic book for the 3rd grade!,"All children are easily influenced by their peers, family, and friends. Socially, we go through development in ""awkward"" stages. Some just try so hard to be the perfect student, friend, and or family member. This book teaches us that we are great who we are! A must read!!!! My daughter will be doing a book report on this. Stephen Manes is brilliant and makes adults see the errors of our ways."
2,Be PerfectBe a Perfect Person in Just 3 days!,"Be a Perfect Person in Just 3 days!Would you ever listen to a book that told you to wear broccoli around your neck at school?This book is about a boy that wants to be a perfect person. So one day he went to the library. A book fell on his head. He got it and did everything that he was told.If you want to find out what happens, read the book.I think that it was a very good book. I loved it. Because it was funny.I recommend that this book would be for ages 6 to 14."
5,be a perfect person in just three days,The book is about boy how is in the library and a book falls on his head and the books title is be a perfect person in just three days. Well he pick the book up and looked on the back and see a goofy person and thinks how can a goofy looking person teach him how tobe perfect.
4,Copland Fan,"I love Copland's music and wanted to add this music piece to my collection. Although it is not considered a Copland masterpiece like Appalachian Spring, the music style is typical Copland and will not disappoint fans of his."
4,outstanding!,"one of slatkins best recordings.with copland hes on, the sound on this cd is ok,not as good as his telarc recordings witch i think are his better recordings but this one is one of them to."
1,Bad switch,"I had gotten two, one for my wife and one for me. Wife gave hers away for Christmas, and I'm not sure how theirs is. The 2 that I have had, both switches have gave out and I need to send it back again for replacement, or just write it off and move to a different brand. They are nice flashlights just bad switches."
5,Get It!,"I was first introduced to Abbey Lincoln through film. I have in my collection ""For Love of Ivy"" in which she co-stars with Sidney Poitier. Also, ""Nothing But a Man"" in which she co-stars with Ivan Dixon. The films are timeless pieces. I play them again and again. Sidney and Abbey are FUNNY, FUNNY, FUNNY in ""For Love of Ivy."" (Check them out.)I knew Abbey sang BUT I didn't know how WELL she sang. Smooth, controlled flexible, melodic tones. Lyrics that had/have significance - then and now. If you like jazz, check out the listening samples and add ""Abbey is Blue"" to your shopping cart. Shirley Horn - may she rest in peace - is another forgotten notable, as well. She sang the opening and closing theme song to ""For Love of Ivy."" (Her name is nowhere to be found on the credits - at least not on the VHS I purchased.) Broaden your musical palate."
3,William Whyte - Revival in Rose Street,"William Whyte's book has been updated and replaced by a fuller history of Charlotte Baptist Chapel, Edinburgh, by Ian L.S. Balfour in 2007, under a title of the same name (the title being used with the permission of Mr Whyte's family). The text of Mr Whyte's book is available in full in the CD with the 2007 book, and a few copies of the original book are still available through Charlotte Chapel."
2,i got a blue one that looked like a factory defect,"the blue one I received looked like a factory defect so I sent it back. stitching was off, craftsmanship quality was not great. so I ordered a new one different in brand and style after seeing a larger size of it, and trying it on physically in a karate store; they didn't have my size there though so hopefully I'll be happy with the new one amazon sends me."
5,Works perfectly,We have a wood fired hot tub. We wanted to keep the water hot overnight for an early morning soak to complement our evening soak. This product solved our needs of a water proof insulation that can be cut to fit. Easy to use and floats nicely on the water. We tested the water temp in the morning after 12 hours and got a 100 degree reading. We also wrapped the entire tub with reflectix.
1,No Karen Kushner,"Kevin was my brother, and believe me, Karen Kushner is NOT an expert on Kevin's music. She can play it so-so, but to hear the real deal, you need to buy and listen to Kevin's albums. He's a much, much better pianist. Just listen and that's all the proof you need. Where she gets off calling herself an expert on his music is just not right."
5,Fox is never killed!,"Rita Mae Brown's Foxhunting series is exceptional. Very detailed, lots of action sequences, and interesting human:human and human:animal interactions. Can't beat Rita Mae Brown for an absorbing reading experience!"
4,Beatrix Potter with attitude,"An interesting combination of fantasy and mystery although the mystery is not important to the storyline.You may wonder as you read any book in this series how a town full of freedom loving, democratic minded citizens could be persuaded to call a silly, 70-year old harridan Master. Why they would endure her pettiness and mean spirited insults and why they obey her whimsical dictates. Those answers and others are never fully revealed to the reader.Brown shows an absurd lack of knowledge when it comes to all the animals in her novels. Foxes don't enjoy being hunted, nor do they sit around their humble dens at night and gossip about foxhunters. Horses don't enjoy being jumped over ice to give their riders a thrill. But wishing makes it so in this Virginia community, that is if you are one of the hunting-mad, rich gentry.Ignore the basic cruelty to animals and the unpleasant sense of entitlement felt by the fox hunters."
3,Good story.....even with the information overload,"I really like Rita Mae Brown's work. I like the interaction between people and animals and I love that the animals usually figure out something's amiss long before their human counterpoints catch on.OUTFOXED tells the story of a murder in the genteel Virginia countryside amidst the rigid regulations of the fox hunting crowd. While I enjoyed the story, I felt she gave her reader entirely too much information on every single detail of the hunt, the attire, the horses and the hounds. I'd be worn out before I ever cleared the first fence if I participated in the sport.If you're interested, this book could certainly serve as a primer on the equine etiquette of the hunt. It was just a bit too much for me.Enjoy!"
4,Loved every minute of it!,"The *only* reason this isn't a five-star review is because personally I found the mystery plot to be a bit thin. So if you're not into the equestrian scene, I can see where it might be disappointing. For me, however, it was a delight from start to finish, with excellent characters (both human and animal), accurate and witty social observation, and lots of lovely detail on the fine points of hunting, a lot of which I'd forgotten about. I'll be coming back to this one again and again!"
5,Hopefully the beginning of a new series,"Rita Mae Brown writes what I hope to be a new series featuring a female senior citizen Master of the Hunt. There's plenty of action, a few bodies, and lots of crazy characters. Between laughing at the different characters(human and animal) and trying to figure out the murderer, this book just flies by. I was disappointed when it was all over."
4,Outfoxed,The book was great and we received it the time that was said at time of ordering. We look forward for the next one.
2,Pretentious? 5 stars,"I've read Ms. Brown for years and keep hoping I'll enjoy one of her latest books as much as High Hearts or her earlier books. Her snobbish Virginia characters and foxhunting settings have worn very thin. I believe in southern gentility as much as the next person, but in light of the issues we face today, lauding something like foxhunting as ""civilized"" seems a slap in the face.I don't mind the animal antropomorphizing, but I do mind her using that device to justify foxhunting as a sport that the foxes apparently ""enjoy"", even if she only portrays ""no kill"" hunts."
2,It's definitely not Sneaky Pie!,"This is tolerable only if you really, really loooooove foxhunting. I don't. I fought through to the end, largely because I kept hoping it would turn into a Sneaky Pie level story. Unfortunately, it didn't. As others have said, wooden characters, thin plot, and entirely too much boring, tedious, trivial arcana about fox hunting. (Does anyone really care which way the ribbons on somebody's hat go?) Not recommended unless you're a foxhunter."
4,Good Book for Equine Enthusiasts,"Enjoyable reading with accurate descriptions of ""fox chasing"" and the politics involved. Having fox hunted in the past it was fun to read the supposed thoughts of the horses, the hounds and the fox. Many of the characteristics of the hunt members could be attributed to members of real hunts.While the mystery doesn't develop until somewhere around the middle of the book, it was enjoyable reading. It may also go along way to dispell the negative image fox hunting has associated with it today."
3,Timely Arrival,"I ordered this movie to give as a gift. It arrived promptly, but I can only assume it was a quality DVD because I haven't heard anything from the recipient yet."
4,POTENT WAR TIME ROMANCE IS BIG TIME WEEPIE,"The ultimate war time romance, RANDOM HARVEST (1942) is a three hanky love story that could make a stone cry real tears.Adapted from James Hilton's huge best seller, Ronald Colman is the shell-shocked World War I vet -- an amnesiac -- who marries effervescent Greer Garson. When he's hit by a car, he recovers his memory but forgets the wife he adored. Can their once passionate love be restored?Mervyn Leroy directed this classic and it was nominated for seven Oscars including Best Picture.They don't make movies like this anymore. And I say that with sadness not cynicism."
5,Random Harvest,We both really enjoy catching up watching many old movies when time allows us to do so. This is another.
5,Random Harvest,"We love the older movies. 5 stars because of the way Amazon handled the return of a defective copy of this movie. I tried it on 3 different DVD players and a Blue Ray player, it stuck at the same place each time.This is the first time we've had a problem with anything purchased from Amazon so it was our first time to use their return service. We didn't ask for any special treatment, but they replaced the DVD overnight!The replacement DVD is perfect. What great customer service.Now, where's the season 5&6 of the Bob Newhart Show that we ordered a year and a half ago! :-)"
3,Random Harvest,This is a lovely story of how true love will always win. It may be a classic but it still grabs your attention and brings you into the life of these two people and you are just hanging to the edge of the couch towards the end to see if...Well I can't tell you or it would ruin the movie. Let's just say that the fact tht this movie is in black and white will not affect the way you see the movie.
5,My All Time Favorite Tear Jerker,"I can always tell if a movie is good right from the Start, and this one pulled me in right away. A lot of twists and turns in this movie. A truly wonderful picture that really tugs at your heart with a great ending. A very satisfying film!! Buy it and you won't be sorry! I'm so thankful it finally came out on DVD!"
5,being specific,"This is a wonderful romantic drama, dealing with a serious by-product of war as well as the uncertainty of human relationships. My romantic heart was touched by the conclusion of the story and Greer Garson and Ronald Coleman are a great pairing of great actors."
5,Vintage films,"The nearest film to this is "" Closing the Ring"". The stars are why we visited the cinema and Greer Garson- she was perfection- asmile that lit up the screne and the story line holds you on the edge of your seat. The Mist billowing across the sytreets- a man - a shell shock victim of the first world war- finds love but has lost memory of the past- then an accident and he remembers the present but cannot recall the past- will it all end well and true love triumph- I did hope so for there was Greer Garson waiting for her man to "" find her"" but surely he already has found her- or has he? What a story line."
2,The case for this DVD is environmentally damaging.,"The case for this DVD is environmentally damaging.This review is for the entire shopping experience and the physical item shipped by Amazon. If you are after a ""pure"" movie review I recommend you also see the 'The Internet Movie Database'.The DVD case is full of holes, is lightweight and flimsy. This of course, requires the case to be replaced with a more substantial one (with no holes) and the original case goes into a landfill.Light can also pass through the DVD case, which may shortening the life of the DVD.If a sturdier case with no holes were used this senseless waste could be avoided.I liked the movie."
1,"Too Little, Too Late...","I just received my pre-release notice for ""Random Harvest"" and I am greatly disappointed. Why did WB delay the release of such a long-awaited DVD until almost three weeks AFTER Christmas (Jan 11, 2005)? And provide no technical info about the DVD's format or content. What are they thinking over there at Warner Home Theater? Do they want to sell any of these discs? With a little intelligent scheduling this release would have made an excellent 2004 Christmas gift! Releasing it in January almost guarantees it to have mediocre sale figures. Once again, Warner Bros. has shot itself in the foot."
1,Dumb movie,"Coleman and Garson were excellent. But what an implausible plot. The first part of the movie is well done and interesting. But the story got so dumb that I fell asleep to find that Coleman is going to marry his wife's child?????Give me a break. I'm a romantic, but how dumb was this movie?"
3,"Excellent Product, But Overpriced","Ajax with bleach is a very good product and has been for some time. However, one can likely buy the 28 oz. version of this product for $1 at their local Dollar store. At $3, you're paying approximately $2.50 to ship the product as the value for 14 oz. of Ajax is ~ $.50Hopefully, I've helped someone make a wiser purchase next time ... I discovered this information the expensive way, too. ;)"
5,This is the stuff.,"Simple and to the point, Ajax Powder Cleanser with Bleach is what my Grandmother and my Mother used. When they were cleaning the kitchen or the bathroom, your nose knew that some serious business was going on. Not that it was the most beautiful scent in the world, it just let you know, as you would soon see, that perfect results would be evident.The bathroom sparkled. The kitchen was shiny and new.With all the super-atomic-organic cleaners on the market today, isn't it funny I always feel compelled to return to old-faithful again and again?Somehow you just know... when you want it clean, you want it Ajax clean."
5,new paradigm of health theory,"It not only is a grand books about health behavior but also is a milestone of nursing theory. It s leverage is deep, penetrating and extend ."
1,Disappointed,I am a turkish women born in istanbul raised in New York and the mother of two.I've seen the good in Turkey and I've seen the good in New York.I've ALSO saw the worst of Turkey and the Worst of New York....SO what is the point in using children in such a pitiful way.. No country is perfect.Not even U.S.A.
4,Very nice translation,"The book is a bit bulky as a paperback, with a third of the bulk being footnotes and extraneous writings. Why not go ahead and include etchings, too? I don't need that. I already have the books in separate with all the historical info I need, and if I hadn't, I have the library within a few minutes drive. I was looking for a compact version of the trilogy to carry around (I don't know why) or keep beside my bed. Anyway, the translation compared to others I've leafed through is superb. No nonsense and very straight-forward, but at the same time betraying a certain depth. You can choose to read between the lines or not. The translation warrants a 5-star rating, but the book's fuction as a paperback brings that rating down."
3,Cheaply Produced,"Note that this book is 2"" thick and will take up substantial room in a suitcase. The paper appears to be of low quality (better paper would have been thinner, and probably not a great deal more costly), although the quality of the printing is good.With the advent of word processors, end notes are an unnecessary nuisance. Footnotes would be preferable, especially in a work like ""The Divine Comedy"" where the notes are so important. On a recent trip to Florence, I found (in the Museum of the Opera of the Duomo bookstore, the best bookstore in Florence) a copy of ""The Divine Comedy"" in Italian that used footnotes. Unfortunately there appears to be none in English.By the way, on that same trip, we visited Ravenna (the site of Dante's tomb) to see the beautiful mosaics. Highly recommended."
5,"Exerpt from the Chicago Tribune, Sunday, May 25,1997, Home 4","by Karen E. Klages, Tribune Staff Writer""The following titles get high marks for their clever, low-cost/low-stress decorating ideas andgorgeous photographs that show the way.""GOOD READS:""The Aveses have a mission with this book: To teach people how to choose and mix colors successfully in a room. To do that, they gathered photos and tips from more than 80 interior designers and architects from around the country, including Chicagoans Janet Schirn, Robert Kleinschmidt, Lili Kray, David Seglin and Terrell Goeke of Highland Park.""""The photos in this book (all fully dressed interiors) speak for themselves. (Thankfully the text is short.) They explain better than any words how daring colors and creative combinations can play with the senese and whip up 'atmosphere' faster than any other decorative device.""""The book is organized sensibly by color and is a great confidence-builder for anyone who has lived far too long with bland interiors."""
1,No redeeming value.,"If I didn't believe in free speech, I would take a marker to scribble over second phrase of this sticker. Joking about murder is sick and insensitive. Also, you never know who is in the vehicle behind you. It could be a bereaved parent who had lost a young child. This insensitive sticker would only make them feel worse. Furthermore, if someone driving a vehicle with this sticker accidently hit a young child, I wonder if a judge or jury would factor in the sticker and consider that it might not have been an accident? I recommend passing on this tasteless sticker."
2,Weak and empty,"This movie is Jackie Chan's first major stumble of his career.The plot is good but it could really have been made into a great movie but is wasted on poor dialogue and a very weak script that falls apart early on in the movie.It's about a special technologically enhanced tuxedo which gives it's wearer extra fighting powers when activated.Sadly, the weak acting by everyone except Chan himself really ruins this movie.There are better movies to see. ""Tuxedo"" is one that is worth passing by."
3,"Entertaining, but just.....","a horrible storyline. About some bugs, he11, i have even forgot what it was really about, probably cause i could have cared less, about the stupid story attached to this movie. A tuxedo that had powers, could have had a better story attached to it. The only thing good about this movie is the bloopers, and on the dvd, the blooper reel."
2,quite horrible....,"I'm sorry but this is not a good movie at all.... are you all crazy??? Say it, this movie is disappointing. These american flops will destroy JC's career... Hong Kong movies are worth the money... No special effects, chinese language and one month filming... so what? POLICE STORY, PROJECT A and DRUNKEN MASTER II just to say a few masterpiece of JC. Even CITY HUNTER is much more better than this. And the 2 stars are just for Jackie, because even when the movie is horrible he doesn't lose his coolness and charm. I love u Jackie!"
2,Wait for Cable!,"The tuxedo is a pointless film about a super tuxedo that gives whoever wears it superpowers. Thats all I can say about the plot of this film. It has something to do with him teaming up with Jennifer Love Hewitt to stop bad guys from getting these bugs to poison the water that is used for bottled water. ... Jackie Chan is a lot of fun to watch, but to try and understand what he says takes a lot of the fun out of watching the movie. Jennifer Love Hewitt, usually very charming and likeable in her other films, comes across as an angry, unlikeable young woman who seems annoyed thoughout the entire film for no reason. The 2 have a few cute scenes together, which saves this film from being a total disaster."
3,Disappointment,"I love Jackie Chan. The man completely rocks. He is brilliant. Sadly, this movie falls far short of what he is capable of in story and action. Some of his stunts are good, but ""The Tuxedo"" seemed to be a [poor] excuse of a gimick to permit him to do the lame ""saturday afternoon"" cheesy style martial-arts action many of us grew up on.Still, it's not a bad ride if you go in and expect the opposite of Shakespeare. There are some brilliant scenes, like when the Tux destroys the room. Still, the story was mostly lacking, and it wouldn't of taken much to improve it a lot. Perhaps it was poor casting for the support? I can't put my finger on it."
1,"Bad, bad, bad.","The stunts were not interesting, the women all portrayed either as sluts or neurotic, excessive and inappropraite references to sex, lame story, dark and unhappy scenery, all add to a very bad movie. This is a most certainly not a family movie and that is shame."
2,Too much of a bad thing!,"This was typical Jackie ""I'm in the US now so I can stop making decent films"" Chan but worse. The plot was silly, and if the directors expect one to believe all the drivel surrounding the suit it needs SOME realism!! The suit was doing stuff Superman couldn't!! add to that the poor acting - the lines were trite and just not funny.Nobody looked natural (except jackie in his usual comic fight scenes...which weren't anything new). Jennifer seemed to be struggling with her Nerd-turn-spy role (but hey she looked pretty decent). The best part of the show was actually probably the NYC cab scene which DIDN'T have the suit involved.My opinion is to rent this...if you're willing to bear the loss for the tape."
4,Chan almost at his best.,this movie is funny and charming inevery way. the action in this movie was the only dissapointment. but the comedy makes up for it. i reccomend this movie to people who think jackie chan is funny. jennifer love hewitt looks really good too.
3,dont even bother,"the action in this is weak, jennifer is really annoying and she cant even fight, most of her punches and kicks were so dodgeable it was really funny..but whaetver i gave it 3 stars cuz its a jackie film and theres a few funny parts in the movie and i kina liked the whole thing about a super tuxedo..but whatver i woulda gave it 2 starrs..but i gave it 3 outta mercy..ight peace"
3,I liked it!,"I enjoyed this movie. It made me laugh. It's no masterpiece, it's not a serious super-spy movie, but the plot doesn't completely fall apart and it does what it sets out to do... elicit a few laughs and entertain for a couple hours."
2,Wires?! Say it isn't so.,"Well, Jackie's getting on in years, and in order for him to wow audiences with his ridiculous skills, I suppose directors feel the need to stick him in a suspension harness and make him fly. I can't stand to see Jackie on suspension cables any more than I can stand to see Jennifer Love-Hewitt attempting martial arts. Although Jackie's movies are not known for being heady philosophical treatises or marked by fabulous dialogue, I found the writing and directing sub-par even for his movies. I didn't find this movie funny or exciting. It's perhaps one of Jackie's worst of the last 5 years."
3,Not that bad,Critic Roger Ebert hated the Tuxedo because Jackie Chan doesn't do his own stunt work and relys on special effects. Yes that's true but Jackie Chan is a funny guy. Eventhough he's popular for doing his own stunts he doesn't need to do that in all his movies. The Tuxedo is a still a funny and entertaing movie. Although the action is bad the movie still works as a comedy and I liked Jackie Chan in it. Jason Issacs (The Patriot) is good as well as the secret agent Clarke Devlin and shows that he wouldn't be a bad choice for the next James Bond. Jennifer Love Hewitt has some fun as well and is cute although she can be a bit on the annoying side. The film is entertaining and funny even if the script is bad and the villain plans to unleast poiseness bugs that don't even exist.
3,"Charming, James Bond spoof","I really enjoyed this movie. You have to view it for what it is--a charming, James Bond-type spoof. Jason Isaacs, who has a sadly minor part, plays the suave superspy. Jackie is his shy, self-effacing driver and Jennifer Love Hewitt is the brassy, neurotic field agent who teams up with Jackie to save America's water supply from evil mastermind, Dietrich Banning (Ritchie Coster). Hewitt's Del Blaine is a strong female role which she plays with equal parts sass and brains. Ritchie Coster has a lot of fun with his evil mastermind character. Jackie himself is very affable as Jimmy Tong, a cabbie with a thing for speed. The ending is a bit lame--there just aren't any romantic sparks between Jimmy and Del so it's not really believable that they would start dating--but otherwise it's a fun, watchable movie."
2,Choppy,"This is just another bit of Hollywood fluff rolled out to dazzle the eye and numb the brain. The plot was do-able but the directing was poor, the charachters were undeveloped, the events were unconnected, the story line was uninspired, just a lot of special effects rehatched and over done. Body with no brains, another disappointment. Don't waste your money it will be on cable in two weeks."
2,A Waste of Talent and Time.,"I'm a huge Jackie Chan fan, and I've always been saddened by the fact that, while some of his American films have been VERY entertaining, none have really captured his true essence, or conveyed the tremendous action sequences seen in his Hong Kong films. The Tuxedo is a HUGE step backwards...Jackie and co-star Jennifer Love Hewitt are charming and cute, but the dopey plot (about an evil bottled-water tycoon!) is horrifically bad, and the few fight scenes are too brief, plus the wire-work Jackie does stands out like a sore thumb. I guess I just couldn't get past the idea of a Tuxedo that can do anything...It seemed like Inspector Gadget. And the idea of a romance between Chan and Hewitt is just creepy....I still love Jackie, and will continue to flock to his films, but The Tuxedo was a BIG letdown. Better luck next time, Jackie! And please- NO SEQUEL!"
3,James Bond 007 Spoof.....,"Quirky, funny and light-hearted! Jackie Chan has wonderful humor in this movie where he plays a chauffer who turns into a secret agent to help catch the bad guy while his boss is in the hospital! Lots of funny high tech gadgets are used in this movie, kind of like the ones you'd expect in a 007 movie!The drawbacks in this movies is the annoying character Jennifer Love Hewitt plays..... part of the interactions she has with Jackie Chan's character are funny and the other parts are not.The villian and how he plans to conquer the world is very hokey and phony! Plus how Chan's and Hewitt's characters attempt to capture the villian is a little silly.Otherwise you have a great movie!"
1,"Well, that was dreadful.","I only bought this DVD, because I'm a rabid Jason Isaacs fan, and I'm intent on eventually seeing everything in his IMDB listing, but yeesh. This was just painful. The only good parts were Jason as Clark Devlin and Debbie Mazar as Steena, and those parts were entirely too brief. In fact, there is a much, much better movie featuring those two particular characters implied in this forgettable little piece of nonsense.I really wish I owned that movie."
4,Might be Chan's Best,Great idea for a movie and good special effects. Saw it years ago and enjoyed it just as much on second viewing.
1,Less than one star!,"This movie sucked! Jackie Chan, you're losing it man! Teaming up with Jennifer Love Hewitt, god what a joke."
1,Jackie Can't Fight,"If you don't go to see a Jackie Chan movie for his fighting style, or the comedic entertainment he brings using his fighting skill, then this is the movie for you.Forget the plot, and forget whatever the story is supposed to be - comedy, action, whatever. I think most people want to see Jackie Chan use his fighting skills in a movie, not ""rely"" on a Tuxedo to do it for him.Now, Jennifer Love Hewitt lends nothing to the story. Her character is beyond trite and common, but we are all used to the female's role being lame. This premise is too pathetic to give any enjoyment. I think the major flaw of this movie is that we know Jackie Chan doesn't need the Tuxedo. We don't see him as a bumbling fool who cannot pull off a roundhouse kick without falling on his behind. I know this is the major flaw because The Medallion was slight on plot, but still entertaining because watching Jackie Chan is fun."
5,Excellent Film,"I saw this film on one of America West Airlines Eastern Bound flights in January. It was a great film, even when you are watching it on a small screen, with small ear phones for listening devices. It was an excellent film. I have this movie #1 on my Rental Queue because I want to watch it again on my DVD Player with Surround Sound. Everyone should add this movie to your Rental Queue NOW! This is an excellent film that everyone should see."
4,A 2 BILLION DOLLAR TUX,For me this DVD is good but nothing compared to Rush Hour 2.The tux is full of accion but needs more comedy. One downside of the movie is that Del Blaine (Jennifer Love Hewitt) is way to serious. What my friends and I think is that it needs a big mouth someone like Chris Tucker to lighten up things.The borring part is that most of the movie is at Detrich's house.The person in charge of writing the comical parts and lines was obviously asleep. So if you are looking for accion buy this DVD BUT if you are looking for comedy you can buy it if you want but I would recomend buying Rush hour 2. Now if you are a fan of Jackie Chan and seeking a hi-tech movie this is it.
5,jackie fun,"Jackie Chan always seems to have fun with his movies, this is no exception. Jennifer love Hewett did an exceptional job as the secret agent trainee. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys good clean fun filled action movies."
2,This is NOT an instructional DVD!,I love Pete Seeger. He's a national treasure. BUT this DVD is mistitled. It's not an instructional DVD at all. Anyone who is looking to learn the banjo should look elsewhere.
3,Not a good learning video,"I have been playing 5 string banjo for a number of years. i decided this year to try and branch out and try different technics-like folk style. So whom better to learn from I figured, but good ole Pete. Well this video is not very good at showing Petes style. It is more about Pete demonstrating just what he can do, but he does not explain it well at all. Sort of like half of the teachers out there, who when you go into the music store and pay for a lesson, then you sit back and watch them show off what THEY can do. They never explain what or why they are doing what they are doing. They just do it. This video is much the same.If you love Pete and want to hear him and see him playing some great tunes, this video is a fun watch, but if you are trying to learn to emulate the folk style, you would do better to get the video ""banjo styles of the Kingston Trio"". At least on that video they not only show you but explain step by step the how and why of what they are doing."
3,Not useless,"The title is taken from Seeger's long-standing book on how to play the 5-string banjo, a xeroxed copy of which is provided with the VHS version of this video (and, I assume, with the DVD as well). If you work through the book, the video can be very useful, but it is not your typical Homespun instructional tape. Without the book, the video is still a nice look at the variety of styles Seeger plays, but it has very little instructional value."
3,disapointing,this was a good listening cd but it doesn't teach much. If you want to learn anything don.t buy for i nstruction
2,"Fun, but too pricy","For the $20 I paid for this, I got another batch of campaigns for the original SC (not BW). But that's it. The multiplayer maps included are atrocious; very little detail, and most of the time, imbalanced. Don't buy this; you're not missing out on much."
3,Not Win7 Friendly,"Doesn't want to work with Win 7.. Gotta put together one of my old computers and throw 98 on it, then maybe I'll know :("
3,Only for hardcore StarCraft Junkies.,"Who is this product for?Casual starcraft players beat the single player and call it a day.More interested types play fastestmap or UMS maps, free from the community.If you're into the more hardcore scene you play free maps online against other koreans.This is a well done extension of the campaign editor. Voice acting, no cinematics, about 10 maps for each race. The add-on claims this will give ""even the most seasoned starcraft player a challenge"", but a decent player can chew through everything in about five hours.If you're a hardcore starcraft fan or junkie/collector and feel that you must own absolutely everything made for this game, then this is for you. Everyone else, stay online with the community made maps."
3,A Rare Game For Rare Collectors.,"This game is highly priced, but it's definitely a collectors' item in my opinion. Starcraft is a widely known game and I know many many fans. Insurrection was a spin-off title made in the same universe as the original Starcraft, but unlike the original was not made by Blizzard. Rather, this game offers a 'side-story' of sorts, with minor changes to gameplay etc., (think campaign editor) and is really a cool and fun idea and game for hardcore fans - but if you just want Starcraft, then don't look at Insurrection.And to the collectors... it's not like this game is the greatest thing on earth, but I enjoyed playing through it. Nuff said....."
3,Dissapointed....,"The bind of this book had 4 big deep cuts in the back, so this book will not be unusable after I use it every day for a couple of months. It was said to be in good condition and I don't believe deep tears in the bindings to be good."
5,Very explanatory!,"I have the DSM-IV and this case book is a wonderful addition to it. It makes it easier to diagnose when you have examples to think about and reference to. I would recommend this for any Psychology major as an addition to the DSM-IV. Also, since it does not go in the same order as the DSM-IV, there is no cheating and prompts further thinking and knowledge. Great buy! I ordered mine used, but it was in excellent condition with no markings."
4,okay,I thought it would provide me with a better conceptualization for the case studies and would offer more of a variety of different issues.
3,Probably not for the average reader,"While the descriptions of vegetation and flowers especially are the most amazing I've ever read, the story itself is more than a bit bizarre. This edition, perhaps one of the few in English, was also riddled with typos. If I had to compare it with something, it would probably be Camus - Camus gone a bit crazy."
3,Poorly done edition of notorious Mirbeau novel,"**** THE FOLLOWING REVIEW PERTAINS ONLY TO THIS ""NEW TRAVELLER'S COMPANION"" EDITION OF THE TORTURE GARDEN ****Other reviewers here have eloquently discussed the merits of Mirbeau's The Torture Garden, and I have nothing to add about the book itself. This edition, however, is cheap and horrifically edited (the horror having nothing to do with the subject matter). It reads as if someone brewed a couple pots of coffee, opened up the word processing program on his/her computer, typed the novel out as quickly as possible, and then sent it straight to a publisher without making any corrections. The number of typos is unacceptable for a high school typing class, let alone a republication of an underground classic.Whatever the merits of this novel, DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION."
3,"This particular edition is full of errors, find a better version.","Aside from the topic of the book, this particular edition ('The New Traveller's Companion,' violent green cover), was riddled with grammatical errors, typographical errors. Don't buy this one, find another version.As for the book, I was rivetted! But I like intense literature. I suppose this book is the most alarming thing I've read, but it contains insight into human existence, misanthropic and aesthetic. If you can face work like Lautreamont, Bataille, Ryu Murakami, or even films like Salo, it's for you. I would not recommend it to many people, though, particularly because its effectiveness is deeply conceptual. It uses various metaphors to equate typical opposites, love and death, good and evil, man and woman, into the same decadent event of life."
5,Real Help not just hype,"This book is wonderful. It was written by a father who truly saw raising a child as more than just feeding, clothing, and giving them what they want. It covers everything from discipline to inspiring your children. It was written in the 1800s, but the message is one that parents of today would truly benefit from. I am seeing a change in how I interact with my children, and how they are responding to my training."
1,The weakest of the B5 movie novelizations,"The only reason I decide to read a movie novelization is to see what additional material(internal dialogue, additional scenes) the author injects into the project. Peter David did a great job with ""In the Beginning"" of expanding on the film and really giving us material that could've been there if not for time constraints.Sheckley brings nothing interesting into ""A Call to Arms"" that enhances the story and much of the inner dialogue doesn't even seem like the characters.You might as well just watch the movie again if the basic story appeals to you."
2,Painfully dissapointing.,"If this is the book of the film, god knows how bad the film is. I worship B5 but being in Britain we have not seen the TV version. This was a terrible hactchet job of hashed together bad ideas that lead nowhere. Thirdspace was very good, but this is awful."
4,This one was a great read.,"IMO this was the second best of the B5 books (The best being book one of the Psi Corps trilogy.) Besides providing interesting backstories for several of the characters introduced (Anderson, Dueena and others), there were some delightful insights into the lives of Sheridan and Garibaldi at this point in the B5 saga. For me, the chapter where Michael ""seeks professional help"" to determine the state of Sheridan's mind was worth the price of the book."
3,"Not bad, but not quite great","This novel is solid and workmanlike, with absolutely nothing embarrassing or even mediocre about it. That said -- it left me somewhat cold through its general lack of real style. In that sense it falls short of the standard set by ""The Shadow Within"", ""To Dream in the City of Sorrows"", ""Dark Genesis"", ""In the Beginning"" and ""Thirdspace"", the extremely well-written B5 novels that preceded this one."
1,A waste of money,"If you know the book ""The Triathlete's Training Bible"" you should not buy these DVD's. Nothing new, lots of advertisement."
1,Essence - Snorsville,"This book rates at the top of the list...of the worlds most boring books. It belongs next to the bed, to be read on nights when you have trouble sleeping. You'll be off in ten minutes.Elixir of Enlightenment goes down a bit easier, but is very short, making me look for another book as heavy as this one, so I can have book ends."
5,"NOT JUST GOOD FOR THE KIDS, BUT FOR ALL OF US WHO ARE CLOUD WATCHERS","Any child, or, in my case, adult, who has ever watched the clouds on a summer day or evening will love this whimsical tale of imagination and dreams. The author certainly has to be one of those people and it shows in his work here and in the illustrations by Matt Mahurin. A little girl, dreaming, is able to see some wonderful things in the clouds. I suspect that a child would probably see more that most, but it certainly brought back memories of when I was a little boy gazing up at the sky. The book can well be discribed as ""mellow"" and certainly relaxing. This is a good one to stir the imagination of any child and it is a fun book to read with your child now and again and then go out cloud watching with them. The text is quite well done and as I said, the illustrations are beautiful. Highly recommend this one."
5,"Great book, wonderful insight to Virgina Beach","When I first moved to Virginia Beach, I got this book to help me get familiar with the area. I found some really cool places to visit (like Colonial Williamsburg) that where just in my backyard."
3,"Work until it rains, then the dog chews the stuff anyway.",Sprayed this on a number of my 2 year olds toys. It worked for a day or two / until it rains. Then the dog chews the stuff anyway.
5,:D,"This is my favorite movie, and I'm so glad I bought it and it even came with a special edition cover."
2,Movie - Great. Blu-ray Transfer - Terrible,"Let's get this out first - I think this is a great movie. ""The Rundown"" is just a lot of fun and I owned the DVD copy of the movie. When I saw the price of the blu-ray version of this movie, I was sold. Little did I know that the blu-ray version was an example of a poor transfer and hardly worthy of purchase. If you don't have the movie yet, I'd go ahead and buy the blu-ray. If you have the dvd already, don't waste your money - I doubt you can tell the difference between the two."
3,Watch one time only movie,Baboons in the Amazon!!!They must have escaped from a local zoo or been shipped over from Africa by Hatcher to meet Beck.
2,The Rock...rocks with action & laughs.,"I gave this movie two stars, but don't let that stop you from checking it out. If you like action, drama, hilarious laughs and fast pace...this is for you.I enjoyed it, but this is one of those movies that left me remembering the fight scenes, the funny scenes and the great performance of The Rock more so than what the movie was about. It didn't leave me wanting to remember why they were fighting, just that the fight was good. The comedy was not slap stick... just natural time & place humorous adventure.So if you are a Rock fan, like jungle adventure , action and want to laugh...this is a feel good kind of movie. There is a rhyme and reason to the plot, but so what."
3,good fun all around,"Bounty hunter Beck [the Rock] ventures deep into the Amazon in pursuit of his boss' AWOL, troublesome son [Scott], who is pursuing an ancient gold icon hidden somewhere in the jungle. Pretty soon, the two of them are both being pursued by the mercenaries of mining baron Hatcher [Walken]. A tight, good-humoured, and surprisingly well-made film, with some eye-popping effects and well-constructed fight scenes alongside the typical buddy-flic humor. The Rock more than holds his own as a comic lead, Scott's wannabe Indy Jones is a refreshing departure from his American Pie days, and Walken is a nuts as ever."
4,The Rundown on HD,"What Can I say. This is definately not Oscar Material but what it is, is a Damn Good Action/Popcorn Flick that has some Serious Eye Candy on HD DVD. If you want to see the Amazon Rainforest like it was on your bedroom window This movie will give you that thrill and entertain you in the process."
4,Fun little movie,"This is one that the whole family can have fun watching. The cast of this movie play off each other in a near flawless way that leads to believablity of their respective characters. The action is just enough to keep you interested without over doing it.The story could use a little work, but hey they can't all have gems for scripts.A fun little film for a couple hours away from reality."
3,1 star for the script; 5 stars for The Rock,"If the producers had kept the rest of this movie as good as the introduction, it would have been an amazing feature. The opening was as good as it gets. Unfortunatelly, the producers, always way behind the audience, decided to keep the movie stupid until the end. Because of that, it was far too long. The stupidity never ended and at one point it also included a bagpiper at the beginning of the last confrontation. And the incredible stupid jokes! Why, oh Lord, why? But The Rock shines. He is amazing and the future belongs to him... if he manages to get decent scripts. However, we seem to be doomed to a perennial PG-13 rating in most of the action films currently produced. Sooner or later some people in Hollywood will become aware of an anstonishing fact: not everyone in this country is a teenager."
3,"Not a showcase HD-DVD, but still good fun","Was hoping that on HD-DVD the lush tropical settings would really look sharp, apparently there's a grain filter so it might put off a few. This does fill my collection of ""adventure"" movies nicely, not the best acting, nor the best dialog.. but there is a lot of fun to be had. 'The Rock' is a great action star, and Walken is just priceless in anything he does."
3,The Rundown Doesn't Let Down!,"Having missed the Rock in his previous silver screen roles, I was weary as to how a wrestling star would make the transition to movie star. Needless to say, I was not disppointed. The Rock proved himself a competant action hero in this enjoyable tale of a man sent to retrieve his bosses son. The laughs are frequent and the action is non-stop in this highly enjoyable film. I gave this film 3 stars, but it is closer to a 3.5. Recommended to anyone looking for a good film of this genre."
3,Amusing In Spots,"Whereas The Rundown did not live up to my expectations, it did have some good moments. The Rock(Dwayne Johnson) does add some charisma to the screen with his glib style. Sean William Scott and Christopher Walken are fine in supporting roles.However the story line is really nothing special. It certainly lacks depth and basically was written as a vehicle for The Rock to show if his wrestling moves and stunt man abilities. There are other action thrillers that succede on both levels(story and action). Just check out anything by Denzel Washington or even Arnold Schwartzenegger.The Rundown does feature some comedic moments and some good action scenes. However, the story is middle of the road at best."
3,The Rundown,I think this is an okay movie. Beck (The Rock) is hired to go to Brazil and bring Travis (Seann William Scott) back to his dad in California. Travis is trying to find an artifact called the Devil's Cat in the Amazon jungles. They must fight against a private army and some rebels to get back. I couldn't understand parts of the movie because some of the characters speak Spanish and Declan (Ewen Bremner) has a thick Scottish accent.
4,Funny Movie!,"This movie is hilarious. I love the cast... Dwayne Johnson, Christopher Walken (haven't met anybody yet who doesn't like Christopher Walken!), Sean William Scott, Rosario Dawson... and Ernie Reyes Jr (He's unreal! It took me a minute to recognize him when I first saw him.). Everyone's fabulous in their parts. You gotta see the movie if you like a great mix of action and comedy! Just thinking about it makes me smile!"
3,The Rock Still Cant Act.....!,"I like ""The Rock"" but he really needs some acting classes...The begining was good but after that he just seemed to bring his wrestling persona into the movie. He Spends the whole movie teamed up with Sean William Scott who might as well be a wall because the interaction between the two just doesnt seem to ""click""! And Sean William Scott is a pretty good actor IMO! The action scenes are few and far between. With light comedy that just didnt cut it. Realy upset that I purchased this one. If you are a huge Rock fan, grab it. But, if you are looking for action with ""Stiffler"" type comedy this is not the one."
4,Surprisingly good,"I'd seen Rock's other movies: The Scorpion King and Walking Tall. So, being a fan, I had to see The Rundown. Reading the cover, I expected it to be the weakest of the three. Man, was I surprised. It's probably the best of the three! The Rundown has more humor and more action. It's easily the most fun to watch. The Rock is the next big action-adventure star so it's nice to see a brief cameo by Arnold Schwartzenager where he sort of passes the baton to The Rock."
4,kool picture,"Almost 5 stars. Complete action movie here before your eyes.However, If I tumbled down a _ _ _ _ _ _ _ like they did, I don't think I would be able to walk away.There is comedy intertwined with the drama in this motion picture that is heavy on the action side.The ""Rock"" is a must see ladies and gentleman."
3,aka Welcome to the Jungle (Aust-NZ),"A silly action movie about a bounty hunter(Rock) paid by a rich father to go to the Amazon jungle and hunt down and return his warward son (Seann William Scott)home to America.Arriving at his destination, The Rock finds out more about the sitiation of the people his quarry is associated with - an over egoed Gold Miner (Christopher Wallken) exploiting the local population.Eager not to return, Scott soon sends them both on a wild chase through the jungle with an ultimate mission to retrive and artifact that will bring peace to the region. Rosario Dawson plays a bar owner and part time reble leader that Scott uses to glean information out of except she uses him in turn...Still, as a movie, not much base and really just to show The Rock's physical strength. The info button will reveil quite a bit of information though. Still three stars is being generous for this action flick."
4,"Not great, but a very good film.","Director Peter Berg has crafted a well-paced action movie. Some clever choices, such as the ""player stats"" in the opening sequence, and some quick edits make the movie interesting to watch.The Rock (Dwayne Johnson) becomes a movie star here. While his last effort, ""The Scorpion King,"" suffered from a rehashed script, he stood out. This time, the script is ever-so-slightly better. But the charisma that Johnson brings to the role of Beck is what makes it work. He's obviously been working on his acting skills as well.Christopher Walken makes the most of his latest bad guy role. He's played it a hundred times before, but he's always interesting to watch. As is Rosario Dawson, though she seems to have a little trouble keeping her accent in tact throughout the movie.Overall, it's a fine summer movie that just got released in September instead of June."
4,THIS IS ONLY FOR THE RUNDOWN DVD,"The extras on this DVD are A++, more than enough. The extras include:*Deleted Scenes-The Rocks Exclusive footage*""Rumble in the Jumgle"" featurette- choreographed scnes*""Appetite for Destruction"" Featurette- Visual Effects*""The Amazon"" Hawain Style Featurette- The set on Hawaii*The Rundown Uncensored- Featurette with Camilla the Baboon!Great for any fan of the Rocks movies.*"
4,"PETER BERG, OPUS 2","***1/2 2003. Directed by Peter Berg. The Rock must bring back the son of a L.A. mobster who's searching for a golden statue in the Amazonian jungle. Great stunts and an always terrific Christopher Walken as the villain. The screenplay was co-written by James Vanderbilt who already wrote the scripts of two other above average action movies: John McTiernan'sBasicand David Fincher'sZodiac (Widescreen Edition). At last, note Arnold Schwarzenegger cameo at the beginning of the movie. Recommended."
2,Infantile Humor,"This was a bad movie. The action scenes were descent, but the humor was terrible. I am a Walkin fan, and I had hoped for something more. I was given infantile humor. Come on ... give me something funnier, than a really short guy running out of a bar during a fight. I have seen better action movies."
2,Just bad,"I do like the Rock, but this movie is just BLAH!!!Very boring, the dialog silly and very slow.I fall a sleep after 30 min. Really Bad!Sorry, 2 star :("
1,"""the Rock"" - give me a break","Before trying to watch this, I had never heard of ""the Rock."" Probably not an encouraging sign. ""The Rock"", as a learned, is an oaf who cannot act joined with an ensemble cast of other oafs who cannot act, struggling with a script by writers who cannot write. After 10 minutes I could take no more and shut it off. This piece of trash is an insult to the cinematic art form. On the other hand, if you know who ""the Rock"" is and are a fan, you might actually enjoy this. I found it unendurable."
4,Very funny and non-stop action,"This movie is much better than I thought it would be when I saw it at the theater last year. It is funny, the plot is interesting and the action is pretty much non-stop. I enjoyed the second and third viewing as much as the first.Seann William Scott is very funny and a great balance to the Rock. Christopher Walken is hysterical as the bad guy and has a couple of lines (one that mentions some characters from Willy Wonka!) that will have you on the floor laughing. The Rock does a good job being ""the rock"" and that is fine in this filmThe action scenes are imaginative. I especially like the fights that occur in the beginning of the film without guns. I hope the stuntmen and women were paid well because they certainly go through hell to give us a good laugh.I also enjoyed the extras on the DVD.Definitely worth purchasing."
5,The Rundown,"I have never watched a movie with ""The Rock"" before The Rundown.l laughed from start to finish. Enjoyed it so much, I bought it"
5,Very funny!,The Rock vs. Stiffler. Christopher Walken. Spud from Trainspotting / Mullet from Snatch. Flying monkey balls and hallucinagenic fruits...whats not to love?
4,Fun action movie but lacking trully hd picture...,Watching this movie hasn't really changed since the DVD days. The story is exciting and the action is constantly flowing. That is why this movie gets four stars from me.What keeps this movie from getting five stars is the grainy picture. I have a 1080p and watching other hd movies looked good. This movie appeared as they did very little to enhance the quality of picture. The picture was grainy and really didn't appear any better than my dvd version. You may want to invest in some other movie with a better quality picture unless you haven't viewed it before.
3,Cliched action,"Don't expect a smart movie here. A lot of the action is rather cliché, the humor is okay (not hilarious, but who can resist humping monkeys?), and the plot is rather thin. But with these things in mind, it still turns out to be an entertaining movie.If you like The Rock and the other movies he has done then you can't go wrong with this movie. If you like anything staring Steven Segal, Jean Claude Van Dam, or the earlier works of Sly Stalone then this movie will be up your alley. If these type of things turn you off then avoid this movie like the plague."
3,An endless festival of unrelenting macho posing,"The fight scenes are fun. The Rock is appealing as the protagonist. And Christopher Walken, as always, is a hoot. But this story is like a very bad comic book. It gives you no reason to care about any of the characters. Instead, the movie quickly devolves into macho posing. Thanks, but no thanks. And Rosario Dawson really should have tried a whole lot harder to nail that Brazilian accent. She's a lovely woman, but is just terrible here. Kelly Hu could have made a more convincing Brazilian!"
2,Big Fight movie,"Who needs Steven Segal when you have The Rock. The movie tries to be funny with Scott, but it's not. Not even Walken's one liners are funny. The action is good, but you'd expect that from The Rock. It's one big wrestling match set in the jungle."
5,"I am ""Ready""","I bought this CD as soon as it was released today. I was a fan of Linger, her last album, and I couldn't wait to hear her new CD. This is a great album that I will listen to over and over. ""Ready"" is worth the buy!"
1,Try doing your father's stuff,"I am giving this one star for one good song.........#6........All the rest are trash...I think Jen needs to record some of her fathers stuff and maybe some of his talent will rub off on her. Stop trying to distance yourself from him Jen...you have no where near the creativity. Study harder and try to capture the magic of #6. Ask yourself what you did to get #6 and then take your time ""The Cat's in the Cradle"" Jen!!!!!!!!!! Remember Mr. Tanner"
5,Israeli gold,"Cal Orey, inThe Healing Powers of Olive Oil: A Complete Guide, describes the Mediterranean food staple as ""liquid gold.""As it happens, Galil's extra virgin olive oil is Israeli gold. Its particularly light and savory golden flavor is a real treasure. Dress up your kitchen with this special jewel."
3,Not for runners,"This bra was reasonably priced and was a good looking sports bra. Other reviews I read claimed this bra was good for running and was rated as a high support bra. When I was trying it on, it occurred to me how easy it was to put on and at the same time realized what that meant, it was way too stretchy to offer good support for a runner. One jump up and down was all it took to confirm this. I returned it because I bought it specifically for running and the return process was very quick and easy."
5,One of my favorites,"I love this sports bra so much. Breathable, comfortable, supportive. I bought this one for my mom. She like it a lot too. She is a low-level runner to walker, size 32B I believe. I'm a 32C/34B and a high level runner and long distance runner."
2,uniboob,Maybe this would work better for smaller size chests. For me (38c-d) - there's no separation and it makes a UNIBOOB :(
4,Champion Shiny Seamless Sports Bra,"My actual size fit nicely and it felt as though I had nothing on. However, there is really not that much support like I thought their would be. I would prob buy a size smaller if I had known. Word to the wise."
5,love it,"The item was a gift ffor someone. it came quickly, and she loved it. The material is great quality. I will purchase more."
4,It grew on me...,"I've had this bra for almost a year now and at first I really didn't like it. I like to run and need a sports bra that will hold everything down so as not to cause pain. Well for me, this bra helped slightly it terms of upward motion, but not so much in terms of downward motion. The elasticity of the bra, which makes it relatively easy to put on, allowed the bust to peek out below. I found that rather uncomfortable. For just about every other type of exercise, it works just fine.And the funny thing was, the more I wore it, the more I liked it. I learned to put it on in a way where the peeking does not occur so much and can now use it on short runs. It is tight enough to minimize movement without being so tight that I'm sore afterwards."
3,Not for running.,"This bra is great in terms of compression and minimization of movement, until you get to the band underneath the breasts. There isn't one. There's no extra elastic or compressed stitching at all. The bottom band is actually loose and curls up when I wear it. I could use this for day to day wear, and maybe for Yoga or light dancing, but not for doing jumps, and definitely not for running. This bra should not cost $25.00."
3,"If you're a runner, keep looking",I agree with the other review that said this wasn't good for runners. It's so hard to tell when you're trying them on. This bra is supposed to give good support for high impact sports such as running but I found it to be the opposite. I'm a 36A and bought this is medium. I couldn't get a size small over my shoulders. This one feels snug but still allowed for some bounce while running. I'll keep it and use it for short runs under three miles. The search continues for a good running bra.
5,champion shiny sports bra,"My only complaint was that amazon did not show my size and color selection in the shopping cart, so I wasn't sure if the order was right. However, I contacted the seller, and verified that my order was correct. Everything else was perfect."
1,ES UNA CHINGONERIA,SON UNA BOLA DE PUNALES Y MAS EL BORRACHO DEL SAPO SEGUN TUS PAISANOS DE DELAWARE U.S.A.
3,Not for S&W 686.,"Picked this up today from a local sporting goods store for my new Smith & Wesson 686 with a 4"" barrel. It was long enough for the barrel, but, not wide enough to cover the trigger guard, even with trying to cram it in there, leaving the trigger partially exposed. The sights appeared to be too tall for it as well. Will continue looking for a shoulder rig. Seemed pretty good otherwise."
3,a reform commentary,"I think this is a good purchase for someone interested in a reform commentary on Mishlei. The translation has been arranged to reflect pluralistic and egalitarian ideas. However, if someone is looking for a more traditional translation and approach, this would not be the correct book for you."
4,For use in reform bible study class,We are using this text as our main source in a bible study class at a reform temple. Our rabbi picked the book and compares it to other commentaries in our discussions.
5,There's a trick to getting it to stick.,"I've used this mount for over a year now, and once I figured it out, I haven't a problem getting it to stick to my windshield. (Often it sticks too well.) When attaching the suction cup to the windshield, position the locking lever so that it is perpendicular to the windshield. Place the suction cup against the windshield, apply pressure with the lever still perpendicular, and while applying pressure, lock the lever. (It helps to make sure the windshield and suction cup are clean.) Using this method to apply the mount, I've have it stay on for weeks at a time and not come off until I needed to remove it. Once in a while the mount will come off in the heat, but cleaning both surfaces fixes that.Also worth noting is the intermittent interference from my cell phone (I keep it about a foot away from the speaker and blame the cell phone for that). Otherwise this mount has worked perfectly and has been worth every penny."
5,Perfect Accessory,I use this for my iQue 3600. Space in my vehicle is at a premium because it is a sporty model and this fits into a small space and locks securly with its suction cup locking feature. Great little item well worth the price.
1,Does not stay put,"I got this a week ago and tested for the first time in a rental car a few days ago. I tried at least three times and the suction does not hold. All three times the whole thing came tumbling down. Unless I don't know how to install it properly, this thing does not work.I guess it is back to the drawing board."
2,It broke,"The suction cup broke at the attachment to the plastic mount. Maybe the rubber couldn't handle the heat or being removed from the windshield. I work in the desert, and rarely need to use my Garmin. Instead of always keeping this mount in the sun, which can be pretty damaging out here, I would only install the mount and the Garmin on the occasions that I needed it. One day when I was using it, my Garmin came crashing down. One thing to note is sometimes you don't get a good suction. I thought this was the case this time, but when I went to reattach it, I saw that that part worked as promised (it sucked). Anyway, maybe the mount couldn't handle being taken off frequently or it couldn't handle the heat. I'm planning on trying to mickey-mouse it back to operation instead of dealing with a warranty (if there is one). While it was working, I liked it though (hence 2 stars)."
2,Motorcycle Use?,"Has anyone used this product on a motorcycle? If you have where did you mount it and how did it work? I have a large chrome gas cap cover on my Harley that the suction cup would fit, just don't want to loose it going down the road!"
2,"Great concept, poor execution...","I like the idea of being able to slap up my iQue in GPS mode on the windshield of my Eurovan and go, while keeping it charged. In that respect, the suction cup mount partially works: it keeps the GPS going perfectly, but the suction cup is both too small and too ineffective to stay put where I slap. It kept losing suction (this is where ""it sucks"" would have been an attribute) and dropping off the windshield, to lie on its side 'til the next Rest Area. I finally resolved the issue by attaching the grip half of Velcro tape to the suction cup, rotating the cup, and attaching the stand to my dashboard carpet cover. That works just fine, and I continue to have the benefits others alluded to without having to deal with a loose iQue. You might want to consider the sand-bag version, or keep in mind that if this unit won't suck, you can stick it."
3,Car mount fot Garmin,"Product don what is was intended for, however it was defective when I received it but was able to repair myself, audio did not work. I opted to repait it myself rther than have to deal with the delays and hassle of sending it back."
4,Major Improvement,This product is a major step up from their earlier 'bean bag' device that was meant to defy the laws of gravity and by friction alone stay on top of the dashboard.It is also a major advance over the competing product that via suction mount hangs from the windscreen but in their latest version the serpentine holding device is not rigid enough so the Garmin bounces up and down making it difficult to read.Only fault on the Garmin Mount is that once in place you can only adjust up and down and not sideways.
3,Title is misleading!,"It is a set of 2 gloves! Not a set of 2 pairs of gloves!!! I have to admit that I have never purchased a glove by itself....I thought that they always came in sets of two. So you get 1 pair, not 2! But the gloves are very good quality and still a good price for just 1 pair. Please change your title to 1 pair!!! instead of set of 2!"
4,Nice pen,"I really like the feel of this pen in my hand. It writes relatively smooth, however the ball point feels a bit finer than I like. The ink isn't as dark as I like either, it's almost a dark grey instead of black. It's also gone out on me a few times during long sessions of note taking and then I have to scribble a bit in order to get it started. Overall I do really like the feel of it, however for the price, I'm not super impressed."
4,David Poyer accurately profiles war at sea.,"The Gulf accurately portrays conceivable events within the current geopolitical profile of the Persian Gulf. David Poyer's Naval Academy and Navy Officer background shines as he shows warship life as it really exists. For those who enjoy adventure and accurately warfighting fiction, the David Poyer's novels are the way to go. Reviewed by Igor"
4,Heart of the Warrior,"This is a fascinating look inside the essense of command. What makes a commander - someone focused on the next promotion or a warrior intent on being supreme in battle?Captain Ben Shaker presents that paradox in The Gulf. Some of his actions are reprehensible and others are the kind this country needed the USN sailed into harm's way at Midway.If you like a story about the gritty toughness at sea, then this is the book for you."
2,Too Navy,"I find all Poyer's books too Navy. I usually enjoy naval warfare novels like Tom Clancy, Patrick Robinson, and even Michael Dimercurio, whose novels are very easy to read. But there is no way that Mr. Poyer could keep me interested in his books for more than 20 pages. I don't know if its beause that out of 20 words 19 have to be naval terminology, or is that you must be on a naval ship in order to understand what's going on. Eventually at the end of each paragraph, I get a general idea of what the plot is. In ""The Circle"" I didn't feel any thrill at all and in ""The Gulf"" I was disapointed. It could be that Mr Poyer does not include much of what is going on in the other side of the battle. All we read is of the same seamen, the same officers, the same ship and eventually, it becomes very boring. I wish he would write like Tom Clancy. Mr Poyer has a lot of informaion. All he needs to do is to make his plots interesting. There is no tension or suspense."
4,Better than the other guy says...and why.,"I think this is pretty good pop. I wouldn't try to compare a mix with plain water to a well-prepared fresh pink lemonade, but this stuff is OK. Unfortunately, if you dilute it too much it gets bitter and acidic. The excess water causes extra ionization of the citric acid and lowers the Ph considerably. Make it with, at most, 48oz of spring water per package and you'll love it. Except if you want homemade lemonade..."
2,should be called Yellow Lemonade,"This is a disappointing sugar free lemonade as bitter as yellow grapefruit juice even when diluted to one powder cup per gallon. I drink a Gallon of water with sugar free drink mix per day. Crystal Light loses 1 star for using a cheap old sweetener, loses another star for being expensive, and loses a third star for tasting bitter instead of being closer to a Pink grapefruit flavor."
4,Pigs in the Parlor,This book was recommended to me and has met my expectations. It will help me in my field of study.
1,Fear-Based Nonsense,"I was a devout Christian for 15 years of my life - from ages 19-34. I read this book back in my younger Christian years, and thankfully did not put a whole lot of stock in it for very long. It's been a long time since I read the book, but from what I recall demons (mythological creatures) allegedly cause just about every imaginable problem and can be found under just about every proverbial rock. Believers in the ideas expressed in this book will no doubt waste much time and emotional energy trying to rid themselves of nonexistent entities and their belongings that allegedly bring these mythological creatures into their lives. The ideas expressed in this book have the potential to cause a lot of psychological damage. This book is not recommended, nor are the irrational religious beliefs promoted in it."
5,Deliverance Ministry,"This book is an awesome tool in helping you learn the scriptures you read about. It an easy read, but i suggest that you tak yout time with it so that it can soak into your spirit. This book is a must read for those in deliverance ministry"
4,Need Help with demonic activity?,"This is a good should say excellent read. It has the scriptures you need to rebuke satan and his buddies. God has not called us to be cowards but to be strong and courages when it comes to satan and his demonic friends. Read this book, and it is agreat help. You will not go wrong in reading it. I pray it will help you as much as it has helped me, (us). Thank you"
5,The truth.,"Do you ever wonder why there are ""certain"" habits that you seem to be unable to break? How about hidden sins? Have pastors and ministers failed to help? Chances are they don't know, or simply are unwilling to admit the true root of the problem: demons within you. ""Pigs in the Parlor"" will provide the answers you seen in a easy-to-read booklet. It's God's will for you to know the WHOLE TRUTH so that you may be set free. Here it is. Read and be free."
5,alot of Great Spiritual Insight,"Alot of great spiritual insight, and the book is a little dated, but i bought it in2009 or2010... and there was alot of prayer and deliverance info... Love it, Recommend it"
4,PIGS IN THE PARLOR,I ACTUALLY HAVEN'T FINISHED READING THE BOOK. I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY MANY OTHERS THAT IT IS AN EXCELLENT BOOK FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF DEMONIC SPIRITS.
4,print saving type set,I read this book previously when it was in a bold type face and easy on the eyes. This paperback edition has money saving print type face and not so easy to read without good lighting and in my case a magnifying glass. I was a little disappointed but the material is worth reading and remembering.
1,Illiterate superstitions,"This book promotes deception and magic in it's illiterate superstitions for feeble minds.The only deliverance you will be shown in this book is the deliverance of your time, money and sanity."
5,Powerful Guide To Spiritual Housecleaning!,"The Hammonds have taken a subject that has been shrouded in mystery and clarified not only the need for deliverance, but also have provided valuable information on deliverance. The revelation regarding the roots of rejection and rebellion was powerful and quite enlightening. Those who work in ministry as deliverance ministers will find this book to be a valuable asset. Those who work in other aspects of ministry will find this book to be a valuable guide to understanding and dealing with the inevitable situations that will be encountered."
4,Not for the Narrow Minded,"This book was definitely an eye opener for me. Prior to reading this book I was going through some personal problems with witchcraft that a neighbor was putting on me and was unaware of such things. I had no idea the evil that would be experienced with all the neighbor was doing and all because of a jealous spirit. For she is married to a husband who constantly commits adultery. To my knowledge I had done nothing to this woman, but yet she had a problem with me. Unless you have experienced these types of things then you will not take this book seriously. Glory be to God for allowing Hammond to write this book. It serves as an excellent guide and is very informative."
3,the funniest sty,"hilarious little diatribe on getting to know your inner Oinking demons much better. Assists in learning about all their nasty little habits. Then you can turn them into unholy sausages never to torment you again. Piggly Wiggly would be aghast that his nefarious brethren have been wreaking such farm-like havoc on their human caretakers since before Christ.Every time you bite into some juicy bacon, you can view it as Satan's fallen crispy critters and rest in the knowledge that you didn't have to pork your way to the top!"
2,Tricked!,"I read this book thinking that it would provide some guidance on swine farming in my kitchen. It doesn't! Instead, it is perhaps the funniest ""new age"" comedy story I've ever read. Now, don't get me wrong. I like to laugh just as much as the next guy. And this stuff about demonic possession and the Prince of Darkness, told with a dry, almost straight-faced timing worthy of Stephen Wright, did have me howling--poor word choice?--with laughter.And, in the end, maybe this book is about swine--the kind that you can't present with pearls. Only they might take it seriously."
3,simply average,"I bought the book Pigs in the Parlor because another author, Charles Kraft, cited this book for further reference to his own material.This book seemed to be too matter-of-fact for my taste. I also didn't see eye to eye on many of the author's minor theological points nor the things he permits demons to do in a deliverance session.If you're looking for a good book on deliverance I recommend Charles Kraft and his two books ""Deep Wounds Deep Healing"" and ""Defeating Dark Angels"". Kraft seems more loving and desiring to see people whole and restored with Jesus compared to Hammond simply casting out demons."
5,Second time owning it...,"Excellent reference book. Beware though, only Pray where and for what God tells you to. Do not step out where you are not to be."
1,Disappointed,"Though there may be some practical things in the book, I stopped reading when the author talked about schizophrenia and how people diagnosed with it suffer from their multiple personalities. Seeing as though schizophrenia and multiple personality disorder are two completely different disorders and it was really difficult for me to take the rest of the book seriously when the author clearly didn't even do enough research to find the basic definition of either disorder."
5,Gritty NYC,"I've read all of the Chester Himes series and Blind Man is my favoriteWhile the others are common A to Z yarns, Blind Man's disjointed story and ruthless pacecause it to transcend the genre Himes created and lift this book to a higher level as NovelThe helter skelter style is why this book is the deepest and makes the most sense.Love itAlso read God's Country by Percival Everett"
