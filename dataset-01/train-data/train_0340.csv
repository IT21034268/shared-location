4,When it's all over you'll never notice,"As a major fan of Snow Patrol, (even before this year, yes) I was very interested in this album because it is the one no one talks about. After purchasing it, I kind of figured out why. It isn't bad... that's certainly not the word for it. Its dreamy soundscape and ethereal vocals are anything but bad. It's just... nothing truly special. To me, a lot of these songs sound the same and if I play the cd in my car (on auto repeat) I never realize when it finishes and starts again. There are a few small gems, ""Olive Grove Facing the Sea"" and the title track, but when compared to other Snow Patrol greats, they're something I keep in reserve for a rainy day. For anyone well-versed in Snow Patrol, if you're going to compare albums (and you really shouldn't) it would be most like Songs for Polar Bears. Anyway, I wouldn't put it on the top of your wishlist, but if you're looking for some new music and haven't figured out what to get yet... this wouldn't be a bad choice."
5,Great Music,"This is early Snow Patrol, but this band out of Ireland has it together. If you like their new music, this is a must."
2,Mid-tempo manifestos of mediocrity,"Meaty though unfullfiling sophomore release was more uptempo pop-rock of an even blander nature then the band became known for, they still had an album to go before cultivating their emo-friendly approach."
3,Listen to it Before You Buy it!,"This album is ok, but I would advise you to listen to it before buying it because it is very weird. You would have to listen to it more than once because it's not one of those cds that you instantly like (at least I didn't)."
1,What you see is NOT what you get,"I'd love to be able to review Schlammpeitziger - ""Collected Simple Songs of My Temporary Past"" but that's not what they sent me. I got another disk instead and was unable to return it due to Amazon's return policy (exceeded 30 days due to delivery time to Australia and computer dead).Maybe someone else can tell me what it's like? I don't want to order again in case I get something else I don't want."
5,Great Vise. Period!!!,"This is a great Vise. Woodworking is my hobby. I build many things around the house, from dormers to desks, and cabinets. I saw this product here in amazon when I was ready to buy one buy Rockler that cost $150. I really did not see a great difference between the two of them, based on my needs (function). So, I bought the Grizzly and it has been great. The operation is smooth and it is built to last. I have used it on many applications already. It clamps very well and I am very happy with it. For $30 you cannot go wrong. I highly recommend it, unless you want to spend $150 for an equivalent one."
1,Poor quality,"As recieved the vise was an oily mess. Paint was peeling, threads are very rough and the clamping face is warped. Customer service was non-existent after they get your money. Wont ever deal with Grizzly again."
5,"Perfect Item, Delivered as Promised","I bought several visors and they were all exactly like the photos. Best of all, they were delivered even sooner than promised."
3,"Not great for me, but a fine product","What I don't like about these visors is that the velcro is not a pulley system, but rather two separate strips on each side. I am not a large person so by the time I have this tight enough to fit there are straps on each side hanging out over three inches. If you are a larger man, or have a larger head, this wouldn't be an issue."
3,Incredible Frustration!!,"I was real excited to get this game but playing it I could hardly pass the first stage, This game is harder than Gundam: Zeonic Front and less satisfying upon completion. I've had this game for a year and it just takes that long to beat it. Really rent this one before deciding to buy it."
1,Too hard to be fun,"I was unable to get past the frustrating ""Parappa"" style first level so I can't recommend this game. After 20 minutes of not getting anywhere, I gave up and threw it away. (And I was able to beat ""Parappa"" so I know I'm not totally inept at this sort of game.) There's no difficulty option, nor is there a way to skip levels. Don't waste your time."
4,A worthy addition to any collection,"I remember playing this demo when I was younger and laughing harder than I had ever laughed while playing a game before. I forgot about this game for a solid ten years or so and randomly saw it online. I decided it's cheap and read some reviews and decided to go ahead and order it. As soon as I put this game in, I was laughing.The graphics are a little dated, but I can generally get past that. The gameplay has a lot of variety, many different mini games that last longer than current microgames in the Wario Wares, WTF, and Mario Party styles. Most of the games are pretty good, but a few (stretcher steering) can be a little annoying.The story is great, an intertwining story of this goofy family with slapstick humor showing how everything that can possibly go wrong will. This is a great game to pop in with a couple friends around to just hang out and pass the controller around for a good laugh."
4,This game rules!!!!,There are many good things about this game but a few bad. On the upside it is funny without ripping anything off. It boasts of sheer playability and will last you a for a while. On the downside the graphics are very stringy and some levels are almost impossible for lesser gamers.
1,annoying!!!!,A friend of mine has this game. i found it really annoying and frustrating. It's to difficult to play. i couldn't even get past the first level. i recommend borrowing it from someone who owns it or rent it somehow instead of buying it.
4,Top Notch,"This is one of the best scores of the last few years. Even though the film sucked, big time, Revell was inspired to write one of his best works (alongside The Crow). The love theme is the heart of the score, & it is absoloutely wonderful, totally beautiful. In addition, there are some great action peices, & some wonderful use of choir in some of the suspense peices, that you just never want to end. If only every score for bad films were this good."
5,Great,"The first reviewer thought that this is the only soundtrack for the movie,...not knowing that this is a SCORE soundtrack,...forgive him for his one star rating....."
1,Buy the movie not the soundtrack,The movie had good action and love combinations but the sountrack is just a bore. It's good to listen to once but after that it's no good.
3,Different,I have all of Madeleine Peyroux's albums. I love her singing style. Her voice soothes. But I like this one the least. Maybe I'll get used to it.
3,Madeleine's second CD,This is actually Medeleine's second CD and according to Wikipedia includes the 2003 demo material that was presented to Rounder Records before 2004's Careless Love. That may be why two songs appear on both CDs in different versions .I don't rate it as highly as Careless Love and Dreamland but it is still an entertaining collection of songs for those of us who cannot get enought of Ms. Peyroux.
3,"It's okay, but not my favorite","This CD offers a selection of songs that are okay, but not my favorites. I had been given another CD by Madeleine Peyroux, ""Careless Love"" which is totally great and a hard act to follow. So I bought ""Got You On My Mind"" hoping it would be as great, but it's just okay. Some of the songs on this CD are repeats of her other album but done in a different arrangement. I still like ""Careless Love"" the best."
4,Great background dinner music,"I listen to this album every weekend! I love to put it on saturday morning while I clean up around the house, makes the chores go by so much faster.Madeleine Peyroux has a beautiful voice, she never over sings songs. The whole album is good from start to finish."
5,A real breath of fresh air!,2 albums in 9 years??! I couldn't imagine what Madeleine Peyroux was up to!Than a newsletter arrives & informs me of GOT YOU ON MY MIND. What a treat!! William Galison & Madeleine are a great match. How I would've loved to see them live!This is just one wonderful recording!
3,good book but a bit old,"the book is from 1866, remember that.I explains very detailed, incl passwords and so, all seven degrees. Including interpretations and meaning. Some very excellent footnotes and commens I don't find other places. Ceremonies have changed since then but the main points exists. If you read the forst three degrees in this book you have a good understanding what the three degrees today is about. That way you might understand more of freemasonry than many real third degree masons today :-) Todays books or often high-flying and not so down to target as this book.Nice and small pocket book. OK to buy, even though it's available for free on internet."
2,Close but no Cigar,this book is close but if you wanted to use as a study guide don't it is a one off close but most thing are one step off if you want to peek into the world of Free Masonry is ok. If you really want to know what goes one contact your local grand lodge and join all you have to be is 18 and a male not a big secret just good men making each other better men. Trust me I have been a mason for 17 years
5,A Must For Every Masonic Library!,"This book was the first book on Masonry I ever owned and helped me make my decision to become a Mason. I believe it should be standard for every Mason's library. The pictures add a sense of historic value to the book as well. Simply put...A MUST!!! Highly recommended, not just to read, but to study as well!"
3,How do I put this?,"If you are thinking about joining the fraternity, DONT BUY THIS BOOK!! It will spoil the experience for you. With that said, the book is about half right, due to the variances in Grand Lodges and even between lodges, the information in this book is just a baseline. If you are not planning to become a member of the fraternity, it is a solid foundation for research, but again their are tremendous variances in every lodge so if you think you will be able to pass yourself of as a Mason after reading this, trust me, won't happen."
2,A narrow interpretation of a broad subject,Duncan's Ritual is based on the limited knowlege of the subject.The masonic ritual and procedure vary greatly from one jurisdiction to another. I would not want to depend on the knowledge that is imparted by this missive to prove myself a mason capable of working my way into a Masonic lodge !!
4,Must read for those interested in the Lodge!,"I bought this book because I finally decided to pettion a Lodge after considering and putting it off for several years. The ritual information is detailed, and while it may be a spoiler for some, it only enhanced my interest. I bought the gift edition which is a very nice hardcover with copper lettering."
5,Duncan's Ritual of Freemasonry,"It's a valuable resource, but it takes away the mystery for any new Mason. If you're new to the craft, I recommend waiting until you become a Master Mason before buying it."
4,Good for research purposes,"There is no point to owning this book unless you're researching Masonic ritual; many things here are outdated, and then since ritual varies (sometimes significantly) from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, it's not really very good as a ""study guide"" or even an expose. However, as a reference for the researcher, it's great - highly recommended, in fact!"
5,Great for Aspiring Masons,"Great book to learn all of the rituals of the Freemasons, unlike others, I believe this is perfect for the person whom wants to become a mason and learn more of the rituals. I couldn't say whether this is a good book for the already initiated, because I have not yet gotten that far. I recommend this to any aspiring mason! Perfect pocket sized book, small text though!"
4,So Much for Secrecy,"I am not a Mason, but have an interest in what they are and why there is so much secrecy surrounding their proceedings. Reading Duncan's book is like being in the Lodge while these initiations, rituals and other processes are going on.The book is very thorough, including footnotes, to explain the significance of certain words or the history behind some of the rituals. Great reference book."
3,Put together very well,"This book makes for good reading and is very interesting, but I would not want to rely on it to work my way into a Blue Lodge."
2,A Specific Example of a Wide Subject,"This is mildly interesting from a Masonic researchers point of view because the ritual is only somewhat dated. Today's ritual differs by jurisdiction. Most researchers are interested in very old ritual which was never written. This text represents somebody's rendering of some recent past interpretation. Masonically, it is of limited value. The secret of Freemasonry is ineffable. The ritual is designed to make a man think and find the meaning for himself. Read this and know nothing, but have it cause you to seek further light, then you will have something. This is the purpose of the ritual. Do not get hung up in ""discovering"" Masonry's secret. After all, you can find out everything thing there is to know about it, if you want. The question is: will you do anything with what you learn?"
3,Duncan's Ritual,"I got this book as it has ritual (or at least close) that is not to be written down in my state. Although it does nothave the exact wording I require, it is helpful in getting a sequence of words in the right place."
5,Smaller than anticipated but it does state dimensions above,"The book is smaller than expected, not in thickness but in height and width. I bought it for as a gift for my husband who is about to take his Master Mason Degree and he said the size is pretty typical for Masonic books. He is very pleased with it and says it is what he wanted. Apparently it is to do with the York right and goes up to the Royal Arch. Good buy, he says I got it for a really good price too. It definitely put a smile on his face and hopefully will help him towards his Master Mason Degree and to decide if he wants to do the York right degrees."
4,A Reading Buffet,"Transgressions provides readers with the opportunity to sample ten different offerings from ten different authors. There is a gritty 87th Precinct novella from Ed Mcbain and a lyrical offering on a child abduction from Joyce Carol Oates. Steven King is well represented with a short but strangely moving tale of a 911 survivor haunted by his souveniers from his unlucky co-workers.I enjoyed Transgressions for both its quality and variety. While no story in particular was a stand out, each provided a sample of the particular author's style. Like a buffet, a taste is really all you need to determine where (and whether) you will return for second and third helpings."
5,Just what I wanted,"Quality and design are what I expected, elastic straps snap in place so they could be replaced when they wear out or break. Holds as much as I want to carry, cups good quality. Overall very satisfied with product."
4,Dad Loved It!,"I got this for my father last year and he loves it! He and Mom travel quite a bit and they love to cart around their bar supplies to make ""Blue 'Toonis"" and other fun drinks with their friends.A great find and very convenient!"
4,"EARLY ROUGH RECORDINGS, BUT WAS THE START OF WHAT WAS TO COME FROM THE QUEEN!!!","Now first, you must understand these were recorded 'Live' (A few probley in the same church without the audience) in the 50's, so DO NOT expect to hear ANYTHING sounding like the ""Amazing Grace"" album (Quality-Wise). But to hear where she (Aretha) started from is worth the price of this Disc. Add this to your collection for 'Historical Purpose'. Although these recordings has always been available on Vinyl, Cassette & now Compact Disc! As a Bonus this Reissue includes her Father, Reverend C.L. Franklin's All-Time Classic ""Your Mother Loves her Children""."
2,Aretha soars but recording quality sinks,"I wish that I had read some the review below before I had bought this CD. Aretha Franklin is my all-time favourite singer and to hear her at 16 years of age is an experience that astonishes. Unfortunately, the tracks on this CD are very poorly mastered and the editing stinks. Songs chop off at the end and no song finishes completely. Let me state again that Aretha, even at 16, is phenomenal. This CD though, is not."
3,"**Powdery, Musky scent**","This scent has a strong powdery, sweet smell, not floral and woodsy like, say, Eternity by Calvin Klein. This is more like Obsession for Women. Three stars given because husband likes it and it's long lasting. Purchased this as a gift for my mother who loves it."
2,Too masculine for my taste,"I really didn't care for this perfume at all. The notes were extremely masculine to me, and frankly I didn't feel there was anything too unique about it. I think Burberry in general smells wonderful on men, but I have yet to find a perfume of theirs that I would wear."
4,good scent,I like that bottle it came in. The bottle was small abd come in a spray container which is imoportant wen trying on a new scent. but not the right scent for me.
3,OK fragrance,"I did not totally fall in love with this fragrance at all. It is just not my cup of tea, I guess. I prefer the Burberry London fragrance. Now I have gotten too many compliments on that fragrance. If given a choice, I prefer Burberry London over Burberry Touch anyday. Just my opinion, though."
3,Fun album!,"Corbin Bleu's first album is surprisingly fun and catchy. I liked both Deal With It and Stop back to back. The album has a strong consistency, though it does wear thin after track 8 before picking right back up in the end. Corbin has shades of Michael Jackson in his singing and his falsetto sounds quite good. All this from someone who didn't watch High School Musical. He sounds good on his own away from the movie. These songs have more muscle than some teen pop and match well to Corbin's style. They definitely make you dance!"
3,"fun but real,....?","This was a great tool for the kids. They gave it there all and then called in for help to get some of the parts to fit. They just aren't the perfect match. Even though some of the parts are meant to bend a little, they just don't fit the overall picture. It was a very educational piece of work; meaning you can teach them the reality of getting things that are in parts. They don't always fit together well and they don't always end up looking like the picture. But on the other hand, it was fun to see them work so hard and try so diligently to get all of the parts to line up and slowly become what they interperated as what was on the box cover. And if you tighten the bolts too tight, they colored coating of the parts will peel off."
1,KATE SMITH CD,"THE KATE SMITH CD I PURCHASED HAD SOME OF HER SONGS ON IT BUT THE TITLES WERE INCONSISTENT WITH THE TRACK I SELECTED. FOR INSTANCE, I CLICKED THE SONG TITLE "" OKLAHOMA "" AND I GOT "" GOD BLESS AMERICA "". THERE WAS ALSO AT LEAST ONE TRACK THAT WAS CALLED JUST "" TRACK "". I AM VERY DISPLEASESWITH THE Kate Smith & Other American Favorites "" CD."
1,Terrible,"I junked this map after I received it....why ?....very small print, one needs a magnifiying glass to read it,....it misses many points of interest,....American bought a very fine map co. Hagstrom and really messed up.....I've been a map collector a long time and this is one of the worst."
2,Voice Approach Not Effective,"The author's voice approach is not as effective as the one developed by Dr. Morton Cooper. Try ""Change Your Voice, Change Your Life"" and ""Winning with Your Voice"" if you are interested in improving your voice image."
3,Talk to win,"I ordered this book for a friend. She is very satisfied with it, but says it is obviously used. But no problem, she likes it."
5,Love it,My daughter loves school bus. And this puzzle was the hit. She was and she is amazed.she loves it. Wow
5,Very smart movie,Very good make you think movie. Not the same old mindless movie. Sit back and enjoy.
5,Truly unlike anything I've ever seen!,WOW! This was an amazing movie. Though somewhat confusing at some points but it made me realize that you should treasure everything because you cannot erase your memory so you have to focus on the good things in life. It opened my eyes to a whole new perspective on life. The only downfall was the *distorted-looking faces* That eally feaked me out. 5 STARS!
1,dreadful,"this movie (""film"" to the in-crowd) was a boring incoherent mess. is it possible that mainstream media reviewers often submit good reviews of movies that their instincts tell them are awful for fear of being accused of not really grasping the true beauty of the trash? the only way i can think of to account for the pretty uniformly great reviews. i am very happy to see that a few of the casual online reviewers like me also found this movie dreadful."
1,Failed to impress,"I loved all of the actors in that movie. It disappointed me so much when I started to watch it. I was expecting an amazing movie, but instead it bored me and made me fall asleep."
1,Good for the first time but started to get slow.,I liked it a lot for the first time and wanted to get the DVD. So I got the DVD and watched it like only twice then I started not to like it anymore because it started to get cheesy. The acting is allright. Jim Carrey was great but this movie is definetly not Oscar worthy of 2004. I sold my DVD back because the movie sucks. It also gets kind of overrated too. Anyone who hasn't seen it you will like it the first time but you'll start to hate it after you watch it a bunch. My advice is don't watch this movie too much it will start to suck.
1,Five Star Movie - One Star DVD Release Ploy,"Please, when will studios STOP releasing Collector's Edition DVD's right after the release of the original version? I'm sick of it already. It's one thing for a remastered edition to come out 3+ years after the original release of an older movie, but this is coming a mere 3-4 months after the original release! Pathetic..."
2,Shallow and pointless,"I might be jaded but I couldn't understand why Jim Carrey's character was upset that Kate Winslet left him. From the moment they met she was nothing but a total jerk to him.Maybe its because I know far too many people with that ""I hate my self but need to be the center of attention"" attitude that Ms. Winslet played perfectly or the sappy its better to have loved and lost theme but I thought this movie was shallow and pointless."
1,Slow & boring,It was a little hard to follow but in all lacked any excitment. I found it to be dull and boring. Certanly ranked low of any movies he has made.
3,Winslet shines in this enjoyable film,"English actress Kate Winslet turns in a wonderful performance here in ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"". Her American accent is impeccable, as is her entire performance. Most of the actors are great, but Jim Carrey's performance annoyed the heck out of me - I just didn't care for his character at all. I am not usually a fan of Kirsten Dunst but she is charming and convincing in her role. I think this film will take another viewing from me before I can highly recommend it."
2,Over-praised,"Of the two other Charlie Kaufman scripts, both are better than this one. Those being ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Adaptation."" The frenetic style is wearing on the viewer here. You admire the film-making of the memory erasure sequences, but you don't watch it wide-eyed, or particularly involved. I didn't fully understand some of the concept until I watched the extra ""Making of,"" never a good sign for a movie if it needs explanation. The ""plot"" runs thin too soon. The best moments are when the assistants run amok and get high during the night of Jim Carrey's big mind erase. It's mildly funny. And Kaufman's trademark voice-over by the main character mouthing his racing thoughts is its usual fun self. Worth watching, but don't expect to be hugely entertained."
3,chaosprincess,"I think the only good thing about this film was the score. The soundtrack is worth the purchase, but i felt the film lacked depth, and you never could get into any of the feeling of emotion that the charcters protrayed. I knowa lot of people liked it my teenage daughter did and well even the title turned me off. It was just a day to kill some time we went to see it. I would rent then think if you really wanted to purhcase it. A waste of a good actress Winslett."
3,Another challenge your fate or change your destiny,"type film in the sprit of ""The Butterfly Effect"" & ""Paycheck"".Jim Carrey is an aquired taste. But both he & Kate Winslet break out of their particular type-cast for this movie. Fine performances as emtionally damaged people who find each other, fall in love, lose each other, fighting for a predestination that they should be together.Better living through science. There is a machine that destroys brain cells, the relevant brain cells that can eliminate the memory of a relationship you may wish to forget.There are obvious drawbacks to this procedure, most obvious being what about the other person? There is a subplot involving Kirsten Dunst & the inventor of this machine played by Tom Wilkinson that is particularily touching & tragic. However, if you like Carrey or Winslet, see this movie, its a bit different."
3,OK,"Having seen Kaufman's ""Adaptation"" and ""Being John Malkovich"", I naturally thought ""Eternal Sunshine.."" would be great. It turned out to be your average blah art movie. The premise of ""Eternal Sunshine..""--what if you could erase unwanted memories?--is unique. But it came off as juvenile to apply this to the romantic relationship depicted by Kate Winslett and Jim Carrey. The characters seemed shallow and self-absorbed, and there was hardly any chemistry between them. (That would be fine, except the filmmakers appeared to take them completely seriously, trying to force their supposed charisma down your throat.) Unlike Kaufman's other movies, there was no poking fun at anyone. By the middle of the film I didn't care what happened to them."
4,Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Review,"Lovely movie, but I only saw this dvd once, saw the movie a hundred times lol. And the dvd wasn't widescreen O.o"
3,3.5 stars,"I agree with a previous reviewer--you will either love this movie or hate it. You will either be intrigued beyond belief or bored out of your mind.Eternal Sunshine has some of the best imagery I've ever seen. Great cinematography, a thought provoking script, and a well rounded cast make it a must see. And although the movie was satisfying to some extent, I have one minor complaint. All of Joel's flashbacks and hallucinations gave me a jarring headache. I thought it took away from the story a little bit, and made it confusing and hard to follow. But other than that--a great romantic comedy/sci-fi."
5,"What a good flick!! Very original, great performances!!","I have to say this is one good flick. A story of a couple who come to an end of their relationship decide to erase their memories of their dreadful relationship. Joel (Jim Carrey) in the process of erasing his memory of Clementine (Kate Winslet) journey through memories of great times and in his mind trys to escape 'the procedure' of erasing Clementine. The acting, chemistry and the direction of the movie really intrigued me. I don't think I've ever been touched by a movie that reminds me of the troubles of love as this movie clearly reflects. Great flick, too bad that Jim Carrey was not nominated for an Oscar for this is his best performance as of yet. Great special effects with apparently no CGI!! Highly Recommend this artistic and fascinating journey!!"
3,"Brilliant, yet overdone","I loved the subject matter of this movie; the creativity was stunning. The acting was superb all around; a real demonstration of Jim Carrey's brilliance. My only problem with it (which really detracted from the experience) was that the memory erasure scenes went on forever, and eventually got rather boring. The part where ""Joel"" reverted to his childhood and was under the kitchen table was especially lengthy and laborious. Also, I failed to see a lot of humor in this movie; disappointing since I had seen it billed as a comedy. Still, it was an intellectually stimulating movie and worth watching."
2,Not so happy.....,"I should have been notified that the parts to hold the DVD in place were broken, so from the time it left you to the time I received it, the movie was rattling around in its case."
4,A thinker,"I bought this movie on a whim because I had heard that it was good and ""different"". Well, it was both good and different. My husband, especially, and I enjoyed it although it was a bit confusing. Eventually, we were able to understand what was going on and piece everything together. Very creative, original, and meaningful movie. I think many viewers could get different messages from this movie, mostly based on love, time, and experience. My only but BIGGEST gripe was that the dvd was messed up at one part and we couldn't see one scene. We had to go past one scene and rewind backwards towards that lost defected bit to watch the movie!!! However, for the movie, overall, I'd recommend it for those who want something out of the ordinary hollywood flick."
2,bland execution of old concept,"What would it be like to have one's memories erased? Hasn't this concept been beaten to death by at least a dozen films in recent years? This flick is dull, dark, and often stupid (see Kirsten Dunst's role for illustration). Carrey's talents are not suited for a serious movie, and I kept expecting him to just start making those silly faces that propelled him to stardom. He did reach a new level in his abilities to annoy the heck out of me.Kate Winslet is the only saving grace here. How does she manage to make something out of this largely thankless role is a mystery. The point is that she does -- she's very convincing and interesting to watch. Therefore, I gave it 2 stars."
3,"Truly one of Jim Carrey's best roles, BUT...","...the plot goes nowhere! I found this movie to be extremely confusing, jumping from scene to scene and from one point in time to another and back again without having anything coherent holding it together. However, having said that, Jim Carrey is great. He looks absolutely adorable with his 5 o'clock shadow and longish hair and does none of the crazy antics that he's known for in his comedies. I thoroughly enjoyed him in a serious role and would like to see him do more, but in a movie that also has a well-told story that is understandable and more engaging for the audience. Kate Winslet also plays an off-beat part and does so with aplomb.See it if you're a Jim Carrey fan or if you're not but would like to watch something that might change your mind about him (at least this movie goes to show that he has genuine talent and is amazingly multifaceted); see it for the way the leads play their roles, which are very different from their normal fare."
3,Need to watch a second time.,"I am not sure I am ready to proclaim this as one of the best movies of the year. Not just yet anyways, even though it's right up there. I guess I just wanted more from the ending, which is good but a little unsatisfying. I suppose it's always difficult to bring a fantastic story such as this back down to earth, or maybe I just don't want it to end, but the ending used is uninvolving to me. I am definitely getting it on DVD though, because it's worth having just for the visuals and the performances, and maybe the ending will work better on a second viewing. Even as it is, it's still better than the overrated Lost in Translation."
1,Boooring,"I saw Jim Carrey on the cover, so I assumed it was good. I was wrong. Sooooo boring. I guess I'm not spacey enough to enjoy this movie. Jim Carrey, you still rock. Now...let's go watch Dumb and Dumber.."
2,DON'T BOTHER!!!,"i saw this film, because i had heard so many great things, and read so many good reviews of it. but i can't believe how wrong all these people were! it is a very mediocre film, which will totally confuse you.in short; don't be fooled by the all-star cast or the good reviews you have heard. if you must watch it, rent it."
1,"Jim Carrey should be the new Lead actor for ""THE CROW""","This movie lacks substance(ESOTSM), and i simply did not get it. Id rather see Jim Carrey play the lead ROLE in a future ""Crow"" movie because he proved in eternal that he has a serious dark side to him (in his acting). But if you really think about it, eternal is really a very chopped up story. For those that dont' know, the crow was a movie that was made in 1993/94 in where Brandon Lee was the lead star of it. I don't recommend eternal sunshine."
1,Couldn't finish,"how is this movie so well reviewed? It sucked hard. Watched maybe 15 mins of it several years ago. With all the good reviews I almost want to finish it, but it sucked that bad that I can't."
2,One of the most boring movies of the year,"I do not understand why critics are praising this movie. It is one of the most strangest and boring movies you will ever see. Personally I watched the movie because I like Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey, and they do not dissapoint. Their acting is indeed very strong, but I don't see anything diserving Oscar here, especally for Jim Carrey. If you are looking for the Oscar for the best male performance watch Tom Hanks in ""The Terminal"".Story of the ""Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind"" is very unique and till the last minutes of the movie you don't know what is happening. But, believe me, it does not worth waiting for two hours, it is very boring."
2,Wasted talent-wasted time,"The premise and promise of the plot was intriguing. What a disappointment! I watched in growing boredom as the repetitious images, present and past, rolled past in slow motion. A few attempts at humour were feeble and silly. What about dialogue? Can no screen writer write good dialogue anymore? Are subtle stares and maudlin looks supposed to supplant carefully crafted words and is shrill, combatitive and nonsensical communication the norm in film today? I only wish when I attend a lousy film that wastes acting talent that I could get a refund when I leave the theater and the overpriced popcorn behind. This movie, wasting Jim Carey's talent, will not linger in my mind for longer than a fleeting moment of my time, wasted as well."
1,yawn,Made it 24 minutes before coma set in. Great cast; weird script. Think I'll check to see which Monk rerun is showing.
1,Awful,"About halfway through this mess, I stopped the movie and read some of the reviews. I hadn't read the reviews before, but had seen the high rating. The movie was such a disjointed, boring, confusing mess at the halfway point that I thought I must have looked at the wrong rating. I then tried to keep watching, couldn't, and skipped ahead to the end. Bottom line: I did NOT like it. I didn't find it entertaining, interesting, funny and the least bit feasible. The acting was fine. In fact, I think this is the first movie I actually liked Jim Carrey in, but what a waste of my time. There was NOTHING about it I liked, except maybe seeing Mark Ruffalo in his underwear. I find it funny that people are so hostile if you say that you didn't like it. I'm sure I'll get hate responses to my review. Whatever. I don't need to like this movie to make myself feel, like, you know, so totally cool."
1,stupidest movie ever.,It was supposed to be a feel-good romantic comedy chick flick. Seriously???? That was a movie? People got paid to do that??
4,Mind blowing,"This movie was so unique in it's story line. The acting by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet was stunning. Mark Ruffalo was really good too. I don't want to spoil the movie for someone who hasn't seen it, but if you find it a bit strange or far fetched PLEASE watch until the VERY end! It will be so worth it. Loved it!!The DVD was new and came in good packaging so it came in excellent condition."
4,Original,"Haven't we all wished we could erase some past relationship from our history, from our minds. This movie shows what it might be like. The movie has insight into human nature. It tells us that character is destiny, and that we choose people because of our character, not just the other person's. Also shows how the very things that attract us to someone later drive us nuts or bore us. A boring few minutes in the middle, when the main characters are running from place to place that seems to go on too long, but overall absorbing. Original, too in the concept itself and in the fact that the Jim Carrey character is not condemned for being more restrained than the Kate Winslet character. Movies usually take the side of the ""free"" and spontaneous person and put down the other. This movie is unusual in being fair to both. Both are shown to have their respective faults and virtues."
4,Excellent movie; great story; wonderful acting...,"To quote Alexander Pope (Eloisa to Abelard) ""How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! / The world forgetting, by the world forgot. / Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind!""The title film, taken from this poem, is more about love and relationships, than about anything kooky.But kookiness, in the form of memory-erasure, is the vehicle in which you'll drive during your viewing of the movie.This is definitely one of Jim Carey's better ""straight-man"" movies, and I would remcommend it to all."
2,What's the big deal?,"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a critics darling and hit movie on DVD but I couldn't stand this film and I really tried to understand why this film is so special. Kate Winslet's Oscar nominated performance is reason alone to watch this over-analytical comedy. Winslet is a fearless and unique actress, Jim Carrey and Mark Ruffalo are also good, I just wish Kristen Dunst wasn't in this, she's a one-trick pony! Eternal Sunshine... left me clouded and confused, pass this one up!"
3,Don't buy HD DVD unless you know what it is!!!,I still haven't seen this movie because I ordered the HD DVD version thinking it was just a regular dvd with better quality or something. I was pretty bummed to find out that HD DVD is like an old version of Blu-ray that doesn't work on regular dvd players or Blu-ray players. If you don't have an HD DVD player DON'T BUY THE HD DVD VERSION. Other than that I'm sure the movie is great and I'm still looking forward to watching it someday.
4,IT WILL STICK WITH YOU...,"This is one of those movies that raises the question, what if? What if this kind of technology was real, would I have somebody or something erased, and if I did who or what would it be?Upon first viewing of this movie I thought it was a little drawn out and not as entertaining as I thought it would be, but as the days pass I find myself thinking about it and thinking about who or what I would erase and I find that I can't get this movie out of my head, and by that standard I find this to be a great movie.Definitely worth the watch, but don't expect the Jim Carrey of old."
1,One of the worst movies ever,"People always get excited when something ""different"" comes out in theatres. Anything that's ""different"" is always praised by the foolish movie going public. Eternal Sunshine is one of the most overrated films I've ever seen. Kate Winslet is also one of the most overrated actresses ever. Why on earth was she nominated? Actually, why has she been nominated FOUR TIMES for an Oscar? Avoid this movie if you have self respect."
1,A Sleeper (Snore),"A sleeper in the sense that it made me doze off!!!What a waste of time. I only finished watching it because my son was watching it with me and he actually liked it!I thought it was pretentious, incoherent, and plodding. The so-called plot was ludicrous and contrived. It was way too strange for this viewer.I have taken to calling this movie ""Eternally Mindless"", which would seem to be a better title.Skip this stinker!"
1,Worst movie ever,"This movie is about two losers trying to find love and meaning in life between their loser lives. Obviously, a hopeless cause. I have never seen a worse, more stupid movie in my life. I would give it zero stars if I could."
2,Pales in comparison to the Truman Show,"This movie starts out kinda slow and boring. So stick with it if you want it to make sense. It gets better, but I wouldn't get my hopes up too high.The movie is too serious to be very funny, and too silly to be taken seriously. The story starts in the middle and catches back up with itself in a somewhat unique way, but that's probably the most interesting part. If you like movies that feature loose sexual morality, then you might enjoy it, but it's really a slow paced movie.Eternal Sunshine replaces The Cable Guy as my least favorite Jim Carey movie. I really think Carey is a great actor, but I thought he was too old for this role."
1,Misleading list of extras,"I got the DVD and now bought the Blu-ray. That is a waste - there is no extra on the Blu-ray. When is Amazon going to give us the real list of extras on Blu-ray instead of recycling the DVD material? Surely, Amazon can afford to let us have just that one section to list down what is in the Blu-ray. Well, I am not guessing any more and I am not buying any more Blu-ray from Amazon to upgrade from DVD until I am sure of what is in it."
1,I NEED A REFUND,"I love this movie, I've seen it before, it's one of my favorites but the DVD I bought is for Region 2 (NOT US) could have make it a little more clear that this won't play in my DVD player. Thanks a lot."
4,good,"movie is great, i was waiting for dvd too long because of some shipment mistake but it was worth waiting for."
1,Maybe it's Jim Carrey...,"I just couldn't stand this movie. I didn't believe any of it, didn't find the performances convincing. Apologies to those who loved it; I watched it with an open mind and found it terribly lacking."
3,Very overrated movie that should have been better,"Unfortunately, this movie is receiving way too much credit and praise than it deserves.Yes, it is a good movie. But at times, the plot seems to sway from centrality and thus lose its viewer's interest. This movie could definitely have been better plot wise. Without benefit, it seems to rely too much on vagueness and predicable scenes to explain parts of the movie.I believe that Winslet did a very good job in her role, and so much that when I first started watching the movie, I had no idea that it was her until 30 minutes into the movie! However, Carey pulled through with a run-of-the-mill performance.A good movie it is, but not deserving of all the praise and accolades. ""Butterfly Effect"" was far more brilliant than this film."
4,Unique!,"My one piece of advice to anyone who is going to watch this film is to watch it TWICE!! The first time I watched it I spent most of the film trying to figure out what the heck was going on. Which for me spoilt the enjoyment of it. But the second viewing was brilliant!It's a great feel good movie, yes it has it's sad parts but overall it leaves you with a big smile on your face.So, if the first time you watch it your aren't sure, give it another try! I did and i love it now!Big thumbs up to Jim and Kate who were fabulous, and also to the writer and director. This is a very unique film, one of it's kind!"
5,Favorite Movie,"I absolutely love this movie, and the DVD version did not disappoint. I absolutely loved the inclusion of deleted scenes - some were very funny."
5,Excellent,Made me think about my own relationship where we love each other so much that sometimes the flaws are too much but at the end of the day you circle back to your true love. Great movie with great twists. Recommend to anyone looking for a good movie to keep you interested.
5,Best thing since sliced bread.,"No seriously guys, this movie gave me an epiphany. Watching it for the first time was one of the most enlightening experiences of my life."
5,"beautiful, moving, thought-provoking","This is a beautiful journey through love and the human heart. Both Kate Winslet and Jim Carey produce heartfelt, touching performances. Probably the best acting from either of them. Definitely an excellent love story. Plus, the cinematography is amazing."
4,A Great Movie,This movie explores the mysteries of memory and love- it's a lot of fun and leaves you with a lot to think about.
1,I almost fell asleep,"Jim Carrey needs to stay from these weird, serious movies. They are all bad, but Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is the worst yet. Clementine (Winslet) eraces Joel (Carrey)from her memory. To get even joel eraces her from his memory. They meet, don't know each other, and fall in love all over again. I think the point was love is love no matter what, but is was a really weird way of comeing to that point. Not only was it weird, it was boring. I almost fell asleep. I felt like I was watching a movie making experiment. [...]"
2,"overrated, boring and ridiculous","don't believe the hype. this is a very tedious movie to sit through. the actors are all good but the story's ridiculous. and worse than the ridiculous story is the boring way it's told, in never ending memory flashbacks (before they're erased). the movie bombed at the box office so you decide who's right. the critics who love it or the money paying movie goers who didn't. one other thing, what's the point of this movie? that if dopey little creeps (human beings) came into possession of miraculous technology they'd probably misuse it? that's the point of almost every science fiction novel written in the last 50 years. or is it that in love or life you must take the good with the bad. there's no new ground being mined here."
1,Just g*d aweful,This movie is based on the idea of there exists true love. This is not true at all. Men and women and especially men are interested in basically one thing and that one thing is sex. Once the sex gets boring people move on. That is why there are so many break ups and divorces. We need to make more realistic movies that investigate sex and sexuality. This movie was crap
1,This is a fantastic movie if you're easily manipulated.,"This movie has a particularly insidious gimmick that fools over-sentimental fobs who are easily manipulated by memories of love lost into breathing some wistful sighs and thinking they've seen a great movie when its their own memories they're in love with. How ironic.Most reviewers will try and pretend this is a great movie using the most pretentious lexicon available to film students, but this isn't a great movie. It plods and stutters and stammers and doesn't take a single turn that any thinking person can't anticipate well in advance. It really doesn't make us think about anything we don't already know. Love can be painful but it's ultimately rewarding? My oh my! Well stop the presses, I've never heard that one before!The acting isn't good. Kate Winslet made her fame screeching in Titanic, and Jim Carrey made a name for himself due to his asanine rubber-faced mugging. There's no acting here. There's an ideal, but no acting."
2,"Unlikeable characters, bad vibrations","I was into the concept, the idea that memories which you no longer wish to keep can be permanently erased from your mind. Unfortunately, by the time these scenes were shown I was sick and tired of the various characters. They were whiney, boring, combative, and very profane.(The R rating is well deserved). At times I felt I would have very pleased if the entire cast(almost) had been rolled by a beer truck--at least then the misery I was feeling at having to watch these neurotic n'er-do-wells would be over. It didn't happen and some masochistic urge forced me to watch to the end.To be fair, there was one enjoyable area. The tenacity and will of the Jim Carrey character in refusing to let go of the memory of the Kate Winslet character, along with some nice special effects as this played out. Also, the ending would have been very compelling--if only I could have cared! I didn't.This should have been an excellent movie, but wasn't. Pity."
1,I wish there was a way to erase my memory of this film.,I really wanted to like this movie (I even watched it twice). Instead I just wanted to smack anyone associated with it.
1,Complete nonsense,This is nonsense galore. I bought it for Kate's sake. Tried to follow the movie but best I could do was to fast forward because this is a completely nonsense waste of time movie. I would not recommend it. Waste of money.
5,Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind,"This is a wonderful movie, I highly recommend to any and everyone. I could watch this over and over again."
4,Don't give up!,Don't turn this off too soon because it is a very quirky and twisted plot. It is a very good movie and worth watching!
4,Whiplash,"This was a pretty good movie that could have been much better. It has an interesting premise that I won't give away in case you haven't already heard. (The scene where all the patients are in the waiting room clutching onto their stuff was one of the funniest in the movie.) This movie is one that rapidly transitions back and forth in time. Kate Winslet's hair color was used as a clever way to help keep track of where we were in time, but for me it wasn't enough. That lack of orientation together with the rapid time shifts made me feel almost motion sick at times. It takes a huge amount of acting talent to play a depressed personality and be engaging. Jim Carrey who has an incredible range of emotion and facial expressions in his comedic roles was flat here. Pretty much the one look. I'd give this 3 1/2 stars."
5,Genius.,"My only take on this is.. people who don't like it, don't understand it. It takes a great creative mind to bring certain notions to life. And Kauffman and Gondry combined, makes this movie absolutely stunning."
4,Maddening but mezmerizing,"This movie is not for the sequentially minded. The story line is more scrambled than a three egg omlette. And that's what keeps it suspenseful and intriguing right up to the end. For the mainstream movie goer, it may be a bit ""artsy"" with it's sudden change-ups and hard cuts. But the movie takes a risk and there's not a lot of studios willing to do that. So if you like twisted, bittersweet, thought provoking movies, you'll find this one a jewel."
4,"A genuine look into the human mind, heart and soul","One of the most beautiful romances...a true journey to find/keep those memories or real life events occuring from being erased.I read an article from Alex Sandell that said, ""Even if love is nothing more than a chemical reaction and string of random memories, it is indeed real. It's only when you decide to erase what makes love what it is -- the memory of love itself -- that love turns into nothing more than flowery words scribbled out on Hallmark cards.""The movie was creative and done beautifully by Michel Gondry and the story is nconventional, but a love story nevertheless that reminds you that ""there's no such thing as unconditional love, but conditional love is more than enough."""
4,Montauk?,"I didn't get the chance to see this film in theatre because I don't know why but it was not screened in my country. I was reading very positive comments about it for over 2 years and I was very curious about it. So I ordered it from amazon and I watched it the second I got it, and let me tell you something the reviews you read are not a single bit exaggerated. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a love story, but it is not a cliché, seeing it doesn't raise the question inside yourself ""I think I've seen this before..."". And the casting is a perfect match. If you still haven't seen it, be quick and order it. You'll be gladly satisfied. As for the dvd, it's a nice widescreen edition, sound and picture quality is ok but I just didn't like the menus. Other than that for this price it's a nice dvd."
5,Brilliance and Luminosity for Eternal Sunshine,"I just have to say that this movie is absolutely stunning- a work of art that belongs in a museum rather than a popcorn-munching theatre. Gondry at his stylistic finest, Kaufman at his wittiest and most charming.To make a comparison- this movie is ""A Clockwork Orange"" with love substituted for violence. What happens to the very essence of our humanity when something that is integral to our being is suddenly taken from us?This movie is for anyone who has a spare brain cell that they intend to save and cherish, and not to erase with mindless Hollywood schlock."
2,Seriously Bleak,"The bottomline about this film is that I DIDNT FEEL IT. I'm a very curious guy so when I was told there is something so insanely mesmerising about this film, I saw it again and even after watching it twice, I failed to feel it. This film is self conscious, stuckup, morally confused and pretty badly edited. I found two scenes in this film which tried to be very thunderous but failed miserably at evoking any sort of amusement or ""whoa"" out of me, except the original intented intent.I did not sleep during this film. It isnt the worst film I have ever seen. I'd still give it a four.All this is my opinion. Try not to knock on me.Do I hate it? I seldom use such strong words, but Yes, with every beat in my ""Man On the moon"" loving, Jim Carrey Fan HEART."
4,An invigorating movie not easily forgotten,"This was my weekend for non-linear movies, as I saw both this film and ""The Grudge"" on DVD. The latter film was pretty good, but ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" really stood out for me. It had the usual Charlie Kaufman cleverless (actually, this is probably his MOST clever screenplay to date), but that trademark cleverness was- more so than ever before- acting in the service of some very human, emotional themes. By the way, a concise little 11-minute ""making of""/cast & crew interview piece (one of the DVD extras) nicely sums up those themes for those who don't easily get their arms around offbeat, non-linear fare like this. But honestly, the movie isn't all that hard to follow and understand, so don't let it scare you off."
4,So well done.,The thought that went into the script is unbelieveable. The idea is a great one and execution is amazing. Not a huge Jim Carey fan but I loved his performance as well as the rest of this talented cast.
3,Ties to be profound but fails,"In many ways, this movie reminded me of Vanilla Sky, except that I loved the latter and I could hardly get through this one.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind started out strong. I have always loved Kate Winslet and she does a bang up acting job here. My personal opinion of Jim Carrey is that he is an excellent actor who consistently takes bad roles.I found the beginning to be funny, sweet, interesting and to have crisp dialogue but after a half-hour or so, the movie went rapidly downhill. The plot became very weak and the episodes were so disjointed that had difficulty following what was real and what was imagined or taking place in a dream.Liked the concept of this movie but not the enactment.Sigrid Mac"
3,I am an avid hiker who lives in Southern Wisconsin....,"and I bought this book three weeks ago. I have used the book as a guide for three straight weekend hikes. It was worthwhile in that it gave some good ideas for new places to go, but the trail maps were not accurate for any of the three hikes we took. The distance was off in two cases, and the trails had changed in the third. With some updates of the trail maps, I would give this book four stars. It was descriptive, and gave good directions to get to each hiking spot. Well worth the price."
2,Not true to book or Wharton,"As others have noted, the movie is not representative of the book. I'd further agree that the movie deviates from the flaire of Edith Wharton. While others note that the film is depressing, this is what I'd expect from Wharton. What I wouldn't expect was an ending that left one of the characters off so easy. Further, the warping of characters (and lack of a character) take away from the whit of a Wharton social commentary on aristocracy. I guess if you haven't read the unfinished book, don't care how well it represents Wharton, and just want to watch a fairly depressing movie with people in costume, you might enjoy this."
5,Love Period Movies? - Meet Your New Favorite!,I caught this years ago on television and was THRILLED to find it on DVD. This is truly a fantastic period piece that sucks you in the moment it begins. There isn't a dull moment and all the characters are equally loveable and interesting. The time you will spend watching this 6 episode mini-series is well spent and you will want to see it again and again!
4,lots of color,"I loved this mini,lots of color,pretty people.I hated thats not everyone ended up happy,but I guess thats life.I would highly recommend this movie for anyone that enjoys period pieces.Its definately a girly movie.Infact I will watch it again and again.Sooooo buy it and enjoy it."
1,Beware,"Beware. If you are looking for the wholesomeness of Wives and Daughters and Pride and Prejudice, this is not it. There is a scene where a woman finds her husband in bed with a man (his lover). Definitely not family-oriented material."
1,Not a family friendly period movie,"I rented this DVD thinking it was a good period movie like many other BBC productions, but it was depressing and there was a lot of immorality in it. I couldn't get past the first hour."
3,"Ok, but not recommended","Interesting movie, but too long and too many negative aspects of story. CD is not very good quality material."
1,Nothing of the splendor of Jane Austen...,"This piece of tripe was a modern day soap opera dressed in period piece clothing. None of the characters are heroines that I would want to be. None stayed true to who they were or pursued a life worth living, rather they succumbed to the flashy and enticing riches of the world and sacrificed everything that is good and worth having, i.e. love, dignity, honor etc. It doesn't pursue any ideals of what we should be, there was no character growth or scenarios of overcoming one's flaws to be a better person. The virtuous characters fell like dominoes one after another until none were left and all were miserable at the end for the choices they had made, at the very least I was miserable as the result of the choices they made. If you like/love Jane Austen, you'll hate this. By the end I was just pissed that I had watched the whole thing hoping it would get better because it didn't. Don't waste your life watching this."
2,Disappointing content and quality,"I believe this DVD is a digitized version of a 1995 film. I haven't seen the original video production but the DVD version had contrast problems and the quality of the image was poor throughout.I was fully prepared to ignore the visual issues with this otherwise sumpteous production except that the story line was a deep disappointment. I've read many other Edith Wharton novels and found them subtle, detailed, and melancholic. I was expecting something similar here but found the plot developed like a bad soap opera and ended in a truly modern and shallow manner. The historic background to this period - fascintating in itself - was sometimes referred to but usually under-developed and the characters were rarely truly fleshed out properly. Since this is an unfinished novel, I would have expected the screen writer would have found a more appropriate end to Annabelle's story rather than callow infidelity.I love BBC drama but this one went straight in the trash."
2,Disappointing,"Being a fan of most BBC drama productions in general, I was disappointed with this mini-series. The dialogue was cleverly written, the plot was interesting, and the actors were all very convincing, but I was expecting either the light hearted type of wit like that of ""Pride and Prejudice"", or a romantic drama like ""North and South."" ""The Buccaneers"" was indeed a hardcore drama, but focused on the unhappy relationships of all the characters, and the consequences of their decisions in marriage and elsewhere, with little or no redemption. The film was extremely well made, and the performances were solid, but fans of fairy tale romances and happy endings may find it a disappointment."
1,A disgusting disappointment,"I thought this would be one of those wonderful BBC movies like Wives and Daughters, but what a disappointment! The first two episodes weren't that bad, but when I got to the third one I had to stop watching it because of a very disgusting sex scene. Definetly not family friendly or anyone friendly for that matter. I would definetly not recommend it."
1,No happily ever after,"This was one of the most depressing movies I have ever watched. It doesn't have a happy ending like ""Pride and Prejudice"". This is not a family friendly movie either. One of the characters finding her husband in bed with another man and being ""raped by her husband"". If you are looking for a movie that makes you feel good at the end do not watch this one."
1,Less than one if possible this was soap opera in period clothes,"What a waste of money. If you put modern costumes on some of these actors, you would have a modern day soap opera. After watching Cranford, Sense and Sensibilities and North and South, this movie was a total disappointment. Supposed women of class drinking whiskey from flasks, smoking and a newly wed woman already in search of a rich man to have an affair with was not what I expected from a period drama. Add the syphillis of one husband and the homosexuality of another and you are projected right into today, minus the costumes of yesteryear. Not a movie you would enjoy watching with your daughter, grandaughter (or even your husband, for that matter), it's right up there with Another World. They've also managed to throw in a few profanities and rape scenes for an already piece of trite work.Total waste of money, in my opinion.Don't waste your money on this movie."
1,"Don't Bother...read the book if you really want to enjoy the ""Buccaneers""!","I had high hopes for this DVD. I should have thought twice about it. Even though the price is right the movie is very low quality. The acting is very poor. Where did they find these people??? Oh yeah...that's right where did they find them...except for a few I have never seen any of them before or since! The actress who played the mother of the lead was a nightmare! Really except for Mira Sorvino and Greg Wise the rest were B-actors at best, and you hardly see them in the stupid production!I think the problem was that it was low budgeted and hastily made. It sure seemed so to me. For a BBC production I sure would have expected much better.Rent, borrow or just read the book! Don't buy this one, you won't watch it a 2nd time!"
3,This was just ok,Some of the acting (Mira Sorvino)WAS AWFUL especially her fake accent other parts were good
1,"torture, spinless little wimps..save yourself the 8 hrs...","Save yourself the 20 bucks and freakin 8 hours..The women are not likeable, they are spinless wimps. Instead try North and South, Persuasion, Pride and Prejudice, just skip this one..."
4,Buccaneers,Great addition to my collection of movies. Will definitely buy more classic movies like this one. Highly recommend Amazon for all your movie needs.
3,OK to pass on this one...,"I suppose this series is a drama and not a romance because it certainly wasn't a happy romance story though at the end, the main couple we root for gets a happily ever after - the other three girls seem to just get a content-ever-after. The struggles and interaction between the girls, the gentleman, and the ton is interesting to watch. However, it fell short. I felt the story itself felt vain, insipid, and the characters (probably with the exception of Nan, Guy, and Ms. Testvalley) had no real admirable qualities, some didn't have any redeeming qualities at all. It just seemed that as a whole, the series was left to be desired."
4,Buccaneers,So far the episodes I have watched have been entertaining but not sure about the story line yet. I love the costumes and the family dynamic with the sisters.
4,Good Drama,"We enjoy Dowton Abbey, so we thought that we would give other BBC shows a view. This was better than many of the others, as it contains a poignant story line. It develops great characters and keeps your attention. We enjoyed it throughout the drama."
4,Great Show!,"I watched this video after having watched Downton Abbey, North and South, and Wives and Daughters. As some of the other reviewers have noted it is not quite as good as those and is somewhat sad in the end in that everyone does not get a happy ending, but there is still romance to it and I was not depressed when it was over. Some of the characters get their happy ending. Although the story follows the lives of 4 girls, the story is primarily about Nan's life, her relationships, and her friendship with her governess. I won't go on so as not to give away too much of the story, but suffice it to say, it is worth watching and I was hooked after watching the first episode on instant video!"
4,the Buccaneers- Women and the piracy of wedded love,"Thought this to be a very provocative story of women in the 1800's.Arranged marriages (some yes,some no), 'propriety of the day' not followed,and all with some very interesting turns to these young women's love-lives."
2,The Buccaneers lacks substance,"I was disappointed in ""The Buccanners."" I expected a higher quality production. Because I have not read the book I cannot vouch for accuracy of plot. I found the series hard to watch and finish. The story makes the American rich look empty and shallow. Not to the quality of a Master Piece Theater Production. I wish the USA had something to compare to the BBC productions."
2,The Buccaneers,I found this mini series to be boring. I didn't finish all of it because it was torture.
1,Worst Movie I saw this year,"This is soap opera trash. I could not give a rip about a single character and if they had all died in a fire at teh end I would have had a Seinfeld reaction. ""That's a Shame."" Straight in the trash."
5,The Buccaneers,Excellent BBC mini series. Uses a mix of historical facts both English and American to give real life to the story. The casting of a very young Carla Gugino and Mira Sorvino make this Edith Wharton tale even more interesting.
3,Costumes were great,"I was not disappointed with the historical correctness of the clothing. The costumes were great. However, some of the actors and their story lines were boring and sub-par. Ending was like a dangling rope."
3,not what i expected....,"I suppose I have been spoiled with all of the recent period dramas because this felt very dry for me. I watched the whole thing waiting for the moment when I woudl be sucked in and invested in the plot, but that never happened. Its not awful really. the acting is wonderful, the costumes and scenery are great. somehow it just didnt do it for me. I guess I will just have to watch through downton abby for the 12th time. I also recommend Lark-rise to Candleford."
2,Let me down,"I was suckered in by the characters, the costumes and the story line until the end where I was left flat and confused by the unexciting conclusion. I was disappointed."
1,Not a Jane Austen kind of film,"If you enjoy the kind of period pieces with happy endings, high morals, and the heroine and other principal characters emerging mostly unscathed at the end of the narrative, this is not the film for you. I only wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this film but I didn't want to spoil the movie before seeing it. In my opinion the movie spoiled itself. I stopped in the middle, read the reviews and now plan to get rid of it. I was surprised by some of the movie's content which without a rating I was completely caught off-guard by. The movie would probably be rated at least PG-13 in America. Some might feel this movie only accurately reflects life and its many compromises and disappointments but, whatever the case, this film's take on life was not to my liking and I did not enjoy it, definitely not an upbuilding film."
2,Disappointing,"Although it held my interest long enough to finish watching, I didn't care a whole lot for this movie. The characters make choices based on shallow reasons and then wonder why they are so unhappy. The characters frustrated me. I really wanted Julius and Nan to become a happy couple. How much more interesting the movie would have been if she had truly loved him and he had changed in response to that love. But no, Nan, in the writer's mind, had to be portrayed as a victim who was in love with someone else and Julius, therefore, had to be turned into a monster. In the end, the only couple who perhaps had some hope were the least appealing couple of all of them. My hopes for a rich and satisfying British drama were dashed! A final note--this is not a family movie."
5,Wonderful women,I love this movie. The acting was great and the plots were thick and interesting. I would watch this movie over and over again.
4,The Buccaneers,Very entertaining story with a good cast. I enjoy stories that take place in this era. Its a good paced movie. I re commend it.
2,going downhill,"The old and new price are very similar.The old bar 2.2 oz the new bar 1.98 ozprotein was 14g now 10gsugar was 19g now 22g,fat was 6g now 4.5vitamins were lesser quantities now greater quantities.Sugar used to be fourth on content list and is now second.Alkalized cocoa powder used to be second fr content and isnow fourth. Sugar is also present as corn syrup and isadded in the Genisoy blend.The roasted soy nuts seem to be removed.Calories were 240 are now 210.The undefined carbs have gone down from 11g to 8g with theGenisoy blend reformulated.The new taste is sweet. I used to cut the old bar in halffor a twice a day treat. The empty packaging could have been cutby a third for the new bar. I like fats rather than sugar so thefood lasts longer than a sugar high."
4,Tasty!,"These are pretty tasty bars. My wife and I eat them just candy bars / dessert (240cal). I've tried most of Genisoy's flavors, and this is by far my favorite. (My wife thinks it's a tie between this chocolate mint and the peanut butter.) The only thing keeping me from giving the fifth star is the price (not bad for the protein-bar market, but still I wish they were a bit less)."
3,does not ship well,This product has a good taste but was melted and stuck to the wrapper. It made a mess getting it out of the wrapper.I could no longer find it in grocery stores and maybe this is the reason.
3,Good Product but 40% increase in less than 30 days WOW,"I tried this product for the 1st time on Nov-12. Following recomendations from other clients and I like it. It is a good product better than other ones in the MArket. I paid $10.43 a box. and Now they are priced at $14.58 WOW WOW WOW 40% price increase. Unless this is a pricing error, this is very sad, this will force me to look elsewhere Too bad....This product is avilalble at $10 else where why pay more???The OLD Product Tasted MUCH Better. Can you see if they offer the classic taste, that would be great!!!"
5,THIS Nada Surf Album ROCKS,this album is really really great everysong on the album is killer. Their new album is coming out soon in the usa. go to nadasurf.com for their albums that are a lot cheeper
4,the most underated band of the 90s,"Nada Surf scored a hit a few years back with popular on the CD high/low, most people never journeyed deeper into the CD, it was filled with wit, charm and charsima that few bands today have. The album was a master piece, well Nada Surf have done it again, The Proximity Effect is fantasic, the only song that seems to be lacking is ""why are you so mean to me?"" witch is a cover tune. If you dont buy this album, your braindead, it kicks ASS!"
2,The datedness effect,"2 1/2While not as generic as their debut, ironically even that album had a little more energy in places. The songwriting is a mild step up from the standardized alterna-pop melodies of Hi/Lo, but far less than initially remembered; unlike Nada Surf's following refinement in Let Go, the vast majority of PE won't stand any test of time."
4,DON'T BELIEVE THE AMAZON CRITIC,"Amazon's critic was obviously biased. As most of US know, there best albums are the one's that get better with age. Make no mistake--The Proximity Effect will grow and grow with every listening. This is truly great modern songwriting. Nada Surf without a doubt should join the ranks of the all time great overlooked bands. List them with Badfinger, Big Star and Weezer. The're just too damned good to miss. It's all the more appropriate since their name means ""surfing on nothing"" in the words of Matthew Caws. For Christ's sake, for Buddha's sake, for YOUR sake, give them a chance."
2,My Review,"I think the book was really boring. It didn't make much sense to me, but maybe the reason why is because I wasn't really interested in the book."
1,Stinks... but used to be so lovely,"I agree with the other reviewers in that this product used to have a light, wonderful lavender scent. Now it has more of a Pine-Sol cleaning smell scent to it, and it smells more like Rosemary than Lavender. :("
1,"Natural lavender, normally nice was spoiled and stinky","I have ordered this product for years and this is the first time the product was rotten. I don't know if the natural lavender botanicals were spoiled, but the shower gel smelled only of chemicals - and a disgusting combination of those. I couldn't use the product and threw away large quantities of it. I will never order it again."
1,Smells like my floor cleaner,I am not kidding. It smells so bad it makes me wonder what bad stuff is in it. I will finish this bottle but will not buy again.
1,I THREW OUT THE HONEY MANGO TWO WEEKS AGO,I've been buying the Citrus for years. I tried the Honey Mango and almost vomited from the chemicals in it. I couldn't wash off the stench for an entire day. I believe they must have outsourced to China and are now poisoning this population with chemicals. I will never buy any Alba products again -- and I've spent many hundreds over the years.
5,Great Product!!,"My husband & I both use this product and love the smell. It's a citrus floral smell and it smells divine. A little of this product goes a long way! Yes, it is very emollient and gently cleans your skin. This product rinses off easily."
2,Definitely not what I was expecting,"I have used other Alba products and have really enjoyed them but this was nowhere near as good as the others. It doesn't lather and it doesn't smell like lavender... If you want a better lavender scent, try avalon organics."
5,i loved it,After reading this slim book I felt like I'd gone hiking with McKibben. And I felt like moving to the areas he describes: Vermont and the Adirondacks.
5,His best solo album,"Character Assassination is probably Ed's strongest solo work with great melodies throughout and an overall feel reminiscent of Dylan's ""Blood on the Tracks"". He may have put out more interesting albums (think ""Electrical Storm"", ""Rooms of the Magnificent"" & anything by his old band ""The Laughing Clowns"") but this one hangs together better than his other solo albums and has no real weaknesses.A perfect first album for new Ed fans. Also try ""Black Ticket Day"" and ""Honey's Steel Gold"" for others in a similar vein"
2,"didn't ""discover"" much","Maybe if you're interested in a trek down Memory Lane of Red Sox Nation, this is the book for you, but don't buy it if you're a baseball fan who wants to learn the ""positioning of infielders and outfielders, what goes on at batting practice, the difference between choking up and getting the yips"" forget about this book. It was a pleasant read of personal anecdotes of a former player now broadcaster, but I didn't learn a thing about the ""inside' of the game. I'm a fan who loves to watch the psychological aspects of a baseball game (the role confidence plays, handling failure, etc.) and from the title, I thought this book would be about that, and would let me ""see"" the game from the eyes of a player. Not."
5,The best recording out there,"if you want a recording of miss siagon, this the one to buy. after hearing almost every recording of MS out there, this one, created as the most complete and updated, surpasses all. in this new vist to saigon the music and the lyrics have undergone minor to major changes from the original london production. thus making the story of kim and the other five characters who come together under extrodinary circumstances, so realistic, this recording should be harolded as a master peice of musical theater. the london production lacked the emotion and the historical accuracy that is now portrayed through the music and through the acting in this recording. six years later after the opening in london are we able to hear and bear witness to the full potential that miss saigon truly has."
4,A good soundtrack,"I am going to be in a community theater production of this show and this soundtrack is better than the original london recording if you want to hear most of the show, not just the actual songs. Also, the CDs are seperated by act, rather than the London discs that have act one run over into the second cd a little, so that's kinda nice to have it play through and not interrupt except where the intermission would be anyway."
4,=),"i bought this cd a while ago and i love it. my friend has the london cast and when i listened to it i did not like it as much. i think whatever recording one hears first, the person tends to like that one better."
5,"Great, but make sure you have the Original London CD","What I like about this album is that it includes a lot of the music and numbers not recorded in the original release. What's great about the original album, however, is the topnotch cast (esp. Lea Salonga) that this one unfortunately doesn't match (though they're all really good).Get the OLC if you just want to be introduced to this powerful musical, but get both albums if you want to enjoy it completely."
3,"Great recording, but in the shadow of the OLC cast","This is a really great recording, the orchestra is powerful and as the name suggests it's a complete recording. But when you compare it with the power of the performances of the OLC cast, it really pales. I own both but I actaully rarely listen to this recording, because the OLC one is so very much better."
4,"Beautifully touching at times, but not flawless","I just finished reading the reviews and am discouraged by the low remarks on Joanna Amphil's performance as Kim. I found her performance surprisingly more touching than Lea Salonga (who I consider to be a theatre goddess). Her ability to convey her pure emotions in her singing awes me. I was disappointed in Ms. Salonga's performance, due to her young age. (And as a side note... I just saw Lea on Broadway and absolutely adored her.) I believe Joanna is the only actress worth noting specifically on the Complete Recording. All the others are adequate, and could have been cast better. On a whole, I much prefer the Complete Recording to the original recording because I feel it has a fuller, more beautiful sound, and is far superior."
2,1989 London Cast is much better that this CD,Lea Solonga will always be Miss Saigon. Not putting her on this CD is a crime.
2,Im so sorry!!!,"Im so sorry.. i even want to rate this as a one star.. well.. all of the cast are not as better as the orginal londons cast.. even the one who sang the ""the movie in my mind"" here sounds funny.. and Joanna Ampil and whoever plays Chris and John's sounds funny especially with their accents. Gosh! its like they recite a poem or a declamation or what? Its not melodic, I dont wanna be respectable to these people but to be honest, its not worth buying. I dont care if the OLC does have the missing part but i still love the way they sang. You better get the Original London's Cast if you dont wanna waste your money."
1,Natrol CoQ10,"I cannot eat soybean oil or other soy products. I reviewed several online products, and this one did not mention soybean in the ingredients at least that I saw. But in fact, when it arrived and I read all of the ingredients it did in fact contain soybean. So I had to mail it back. I wish I could obtain a CoQ10 product without soybean.Pat Gladden"
2,Ingedient listing is incorrect,"I ordered this product after carefully reviewing many products because I am allergic to soy. This one clearly states, ""Contains no yeast, wheat, corn, milk, egg, soy, glutens, or sugar"", but when I received it the first of the 'other' ingredients is Soybean Oil. I didn't give it one star because I couldn't try it and rightfully say I hated it, I just don't like the fact of the soy. For others it probably is a great deal."
4,"Informative, Cinematography Lacking","I recommend this video with one caveat. The cinematography is fuzzy, the colors dull, as if watching a 1970s sitcom. I suppose HD has spoiled me, and perhaps others won't mind as much. The video itself is very detailed and informative, offering up the patron-artist relationship between home owner Kaufmann and Wright; the tensions, the creative process, the give-and-take between two strong-minded individuals to bring a magnificent structure into being. The house now belongs to the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy, hence the signs (""Entrance"") that somewhat spoil the homey atmosphere. Overall, the video succeeds in introducing the beauty and the true grandeur of Fallingwater in its sylvan setting."
3,Good Resource,"This helped me write a major paper. Easily comprehensible, full of great source material, and not as dry as some books used for research."
3,good background read for FEVER series,I keep wishing I had read this series BEFORE I read the Fever series. There is alot of background information here. I still do not like the writing style in this series as much as I love the Fever series but it is still great. I can never understand how an author can do that. Write in such different ways for their different series. AMAZING. Anyways we learn more about Queen Aoibheal and we see how she is setting things up for FEVER. Not so crazy about these girls in these Highlander books. They all seem so shallow for some reason. I guess I want to see the same grit Mac is made of. Sidenote- Jessi has short black hair or so we keep reading so who is this girl in the cover??
4,Great Story!!,"This installment in the MacKeltar series was very good. It started rather silly at first, which may account for some of the less than 4 or 5 stars, but, once the story gets going, it is a rollercoaster ride up until the last page! Don't be put-off by the slow start, keep reading & you won't be disappointed; cannot WAIT for the next installment. Karen Moning, keep up the great work!"
3,SPELL OF THE HIGHLANDER,"I was expecting more then what was delivery on this one, it just was not Karen best work. It appears as if something was missing.And it left you with a lot of questions. 3 stars for this one.Linda Hubbard"
5,romance novel,"I really love this series, I admit, I have read these books many times. karen moning writes very well and keeps me captivated."
2,Spell of the Highlander,"This is the third book in this series that I have read. Kiss of the HL and Dark HL being the other two, and I am glad I read the other two first. Cian is the worst character of the three. Drustan and Daegus are written with much more love and tenderness in their hearts. Now don't get me wrong I love an Alpha Male in my romance novels but he has to have a heart underneath that muscular chest. The whole couldn't keep their hands off each other was stupid, with the ""tupping"" in the hallway while everyone else is trapped in the library. I just wanted Drustan and Daegus to beat the crap out of him. I also did not like the heroine and I really tried to like her. I would only recommend this book if you read the other two and wanted to see Drustan and Daegus again."
2,So Disappointed In This Boring Tale,"I loved other books by this author, especially the books about Grimm & Hawk, but this one, featuring Cian [KEY-on] & Jessi, was pretty boring. It had its moments but quite frankly, until Daegus got involved at the end there, in a surprisingly witty and compassionate role, this book was doomed. I guess using the mirror was a necessary plot idea to the overall theme of Moning's tales, but I wasn't thrilled about this approach."
3,Average... and disapointing,"I rarely write reviews of books, but I had to this time. I see countless reviews that tout this as wonderful, but honestly it's average... and average for this author is just plain awful. I've read all of her books and ordered this one months before it actually came out.It would be unfair to say it was a bad book, but it pales in comparison to books like ""The Dark Highlander"" or, really, any of the author's previous titles. If you want a decent romance novel, this one's fine. But it's not at all what she's capable of. The plot is regurgitated from ""The Immortal Highlander"" (save your money and buy that one in paperback).I'm still a HUGE fan of her work and will buy her next book, but it would be completely unfair to say this isn't the worst of her works. Everybody has bad days and this title represents Ms. Moning's."
3,I liked this book but..........,"I really liked this book but Cians' whole me Tarzan, you Jane attitude got on my nerves. I mean one minute he's being wonderfully sweet then the next he's treating Jessie like she can't think for herself. All the men in the other books where tough too, but they treated the women with more respect than this guy who, if he had listened to his mother in the first place, wouldn't have been cursed. Then when he met his decendents he acted like they were beneath him. Other than that the story kept me turning pages. I just hope the next installment of this series does better."
2,Not castle MacKeltar again!,"Why does Karen Marie Moning insist on spoiling a good story by re-hashing the endings of the other MacKelter books. For the last three books I have been really enjoying the story and then she decides it's time to return to the castle Mackelter and the reader immediately knows that the books is going to go down the same tired old route all the other stories have gone down. Even worse she has now turned me off of the the characters of Drustan and Dageus and their wives who have become farcical thanks to the books that have come after their stories - especially the wives who seemed to do a lot of running around acting silly. I think it is time for Ms Moning to come up with a new way of resolving her stories, and reward the reader with something original."
3,Not as memorable as the other Highlander books,"Cian and Jessi's story continues the mystery of the Druids and the Fae, but is less memorable than the previous six books in the series. Due to an evil unseelie spell, Cian is trapped in a mirror for 11 centuries until Jessi, a college asst. professor, calls him out. Her life is in danger and together they escape from Chicago to the Highlands and try to thwart the ancient enemy. This is complicated because Cian is called back into the mirror at unexpected times. Drustin and Daegus MacKeltar are also in this story and it is good to see them again. This book didn't flow as easily as the previous books. Other than Cian being discribed as big, lusty, and powerful, the author has not characterized him as thoroughly as usual. Maybe I was a just a little disappointed because Kiss of the Highlander and The Immortal Highlander, 2 previous books in the series, were so good."
3,FANTASY AND FUN,"Picked this up in the library and am glad I did! These stories should be in paperback form. After reading Diana Gabaldon I do like reading about Highlanders. This book was a hoot!It's sad in our society that we cannot imagine a woman reaching the age of 24 and still be a virgin. How much experience do you want a 24 y.o. to have? Well, I read the story for some erotic fun and it delivered. To take this kind of plot seriously is a big mistake. I enjoyed Cian immensely! Jessie was a typical heroine of this genre. I am pretty sure I've read one or two KM's books and they are basicly the same.This was no Diana Gabaldon but it was a fun read."
4,"Magic, passion, and a man in a skirt!","I love this series by Moning. It's an easy read. It follows the typical romance-novel formula. But it is well-written, and it is fun. If you want to get lost in fantasy, this is the way to do it."
3,"No plot, all porn.","Ms Moning is a great author, this book seems rushed to publication....hardly any plot...just a lot of body part descriptions....so incredible they're laughable...unless there is a great plastic surgeon in this book I missed.Jiggles, throbs,groans I was bored."
2,love the stories....,"without getting wordy - I agree with several other readers, I love the stories but hate the porn !! I also preferred the first several books covers to the newer ones..I was glad that I got this book from the library while on a visit to the states instead of spending my money on it ( I live in France).. so far I have all her books in paperback - and was awaiting the new ones ..now I have a feeling she is kranking them out too fast and using porn to catch new readers..what a shame...."
5,Amazing,"I had never even heard about Karen Marie Moning, until recently browsing my local bookstore, i decided to buy Spell of the Highlander. I am happy to say i didnot regret that impulse. I have recently bought, Dark Highlander, which is my absolute favorite as well as Kiss of the Highlander. Its hard getting new books in the Bahamas, but every book of her's i can find i will buy! She has become my new favorite writer!"
1,Wait for the paperback!!!!!,I agree with the other reviewer. This was just a retread of the Immortal Highlander and not even a good one at that! The villian in this was so pathetic and one dimensional as were all of the characters. The storyline was so predictable that even the villian knew where Jessi and Cian were going to hide. Please save your money on this one. check it out from the library or wait for the paperback and get it used.
4,Great book but disappointed in the Kindle edition,"I love this series and hope there will be more to come. Karen Marie Moning knows how to capture her readers and make them fall in love with the history and magic of Scotland.That said, I was disappointed with the Kindle edition of this book as it slipped in and out of italics throughout for no apparent reason. You kind of lose the rhythm of reading it when you keep wondering ""Why are there italics? What am I suppose to be paying attention to?"" Kinda silly but it really was distracting. I would still recommend the book though!"
3,"Readable, but disapointing...","This is definitely my least favorite of the Highlander series by Moning. The relationship started out very cute, but it quickly took a back seat to other story lines. In fact, the end was very truncated and we didn't get to learn how our couple fared. I think Moning realized this and tried to fix it by adding the author's note at the end, but it failed.We do get to see old favorites, like Drustan and Drageus, but they continue to distract from the plot. I don't like investing 300 pages to a plot line that just doesn't get finished. Oh well...Bottom line, if you are new to Moning, don't start with this one. If however, you have read the other six books, I won't try to dissuade you."
5,Spell of Hot Highlander,"I love when a charcter catch my eye or the author. Great Series, write many more books Please..........................."
3,A bit of a let down,"I bought 1977 and i was completly amazed by it and I could not wait for the next album to arrive. Unfortunatly NU-CLEAR SOUNDS did not live up to my expectations. Some tracks such as NUMBSKULL, and WILDSURF did catch my attention. The majority of the songs however seem poorly construted and are a bit of a blur. The distinct lack of a defining song such as Goldfinger also did a lot to discredit the album. But, like a lot of good bands the third album is a bit of a let down so better luck next time."
2,Really disappointing if you wanted another 1977,"This is probably the most disappointing CD I have ever purchased. I have listened to Girl from Mars over 100 times and there is nothing even close to that in Nu-Clear Sounds. There are no catchy tunes like Kung-Fu. The music sounds muffled. Unfortunately for me, I did not preview any of the tracks because I was impatient enough to buy the import version. I would much rather have received a CD with remixes of 1977. I have heard some people who like this CD as much as 1977. Don't believe that they are anything alike or you will be disappointed. The band has taken a different direction which I was unfortunately unable to appreciate."
2,Very inadaquate,"If you don't know anything about the SAT and want to study for it just a little bit, this is a good book for you.This book is too short and all the stuff in this book and more are in Cracking the SAT so if you have that book, you shouldn't even bother with this one.There are some questions that are exactly the same but appear in two different quizes.Vocab on the back is the only good part of this book"
2,confusing,"I should have known what I was getting myself into reading Newton but I tried it anyway. I can't understand it, and I am an avid reader and English teacher!"
4,Eschatology 104,This book gives you a great viewpoint from Newton on Christian Eschatology. However Newton is not easy reading and might require some prior knowledge of biblical prophesy. I would love to see any writings Newton did on the book of Ezekiel.
2,Not what I was looking for.,"I did not 'hate' this book. I can see that a great deal of Biblical scholarship went into it, but the book was not what I hoped it would be - I have no right to criticise Newton - but was he not a little dogmatic about the 'meaning' of these prophecies?"
3,Scotts voice,Great voice-Just wish I could hear more of his song writing.His 1992 CD something different was even better.Great stuff need to hear more of Scott.
3,Don't Buy the Kindle Version,This is the worst Kindle version of anything I've purchased. The 2nd or 3rd paragraph of each chapter is misplaced into the last paragraph of the previous chapter.Otherwise...A good read. This is closer to the orginal Xanth style than any of the later books.
2,Alright but not his best,"This was another example of Anthony's devolving into what friends have termed sexiest lit... I can't say I was terribly impressed by this edition to the Xanth series; it seems like he's been working to a formula the last few volumes.That said, if you've enjoyed the Xanth books up to this point, I guess this volume doesn't really offer any reason NOT to buy it. Just realize you won't be getting anything approximating original story/plotting."
5,Lot's of fun,I had so much fun reading this book. I almost never knew what was going to happen next. This is probley the third Xanth book ive read and probley the best. Email me and tell me your favorite xanth book. jugglin_josh@yahoo.com
1,More anti-American self loathing from Harvard,"Makes the term conspiracy theory seem almost rational, why liberals think facts are not relevant but their emotional drivel are always escapes me."
4,A great aid to finding your way in Jewish prayer services.,"The Siddur is a precious, age-old resource of Jewish spirituality, and the prayer service is an anchor for Jewish community. But it is complex. Rabbi Hammer helps us find our way, historically and in the synagogue services of today. A good companion book is MINDING THE TEMPLE OF THE SOUL, which adds meditations and movements you can do in your own home. With these, you can enrich your prayer life, your community life, and your relationship to God."
4,For anyone,"Even if you have been attending synagogue for years, this book will give you a greater understanding of the meaning of the entire service....and for someone less experienced it will be ever more helpful."
5,Helping to make prayer meaningful,"This book is an incredible resource for those looking to derive meaning from the Jewish prayer tradition. It has helped me in my own personal practice of prayer by giving me historical context for the prayers I am saying, and by elucidating the structure of the service. This is definitely worth the read for anyone interested in Jewish prayer, or even prayer in general!"
3,A useful book,"This is a useful book, which discusses many interesting concepts, but is far from comprehensive.I have done extensive study previously concerning both Shabbat and High Holy Day services, and this book did add to my knowledge, however, why the discussion in the book was interesting, there was a real limit to what the book brought to the discussion, compared to what a person well versed in Jewish Prayer would have already known and discussed previously.I would recommend the book more for those who haven't done much prior study of the subject."
5,like new,"When I opened the package and removed the book, I thought they had sent a new one, it was in that great of condition. I will not hesitate to order from them again. When ""like new"" is posted, one is skeptical...but not here...it WAS like new! No markings, no tears, nothing."
4,What a deal!,"...This is my first burner and was nervous at first, but the Nerosoftware is SIMPLE to use(Has a burner Wizard that takes you throughstep by step). The quality is Fantastic! I gave it 4 stars because themanual is a little ""techie"" which might make new computerusers confused. Also, the manual says ""set the drive asMaster(jumper) if connecting to an existing CD-ROM-which I did. NOGO...Had to move the jumper over to Slave for it to work. But,remember all systems are different so do as the manual says! Simpleproblem solved so don't let this scare you from purchasing- I LOVEMINE! Get one fast-you'll love it!"
5,Good product--But buy it cheaper at OfficeMax,"The product is high quality but I made the mistake of not doing my homework. I bought the drive from Amazon and then I went to OfficeMax to buy some CDs and there it was for $30 cheaper. Don't try to find this on OfficeMax's website because it isn't there (I checked before I bought it from Amazon). You'll need to go to the store in person to get one. Also, if you do it in the next 7 days you can qualify, still, for their rebate--another $30. This CD burner can be yours for $69.99 if you get it at OfficeMax.I checked with Amazon and they DON'T match prices (too bad--this might be their downfall."
5,Great price and great product!,I just got this CD-RW yesterday. Thank you Amazon for your timely shipping. I have to tell you that I barely know anything about hardware. This CD-RW is easy to install(just follow the instruction). The NERO software is easy to use. I've burned a couple of CDs and everything works great. You can't go wrong with this incredible price!
4,Just getting started,"I just got this as a gift and I love it. Installing it was simple, and timeless. It works great and I would say it is fast. For a first time buyer this is a great product. The only 2 things that are bad that I have to say about the product the softwere is not helpful to beginners, also the customer service is a waist of time. I called them about 3weeks ago, they still never called back. I fixed the problem my self."
2,Could do a lot better,"Not a bad unit overall, made by Ricoh whom is well into the CD-RW drive business. Rate it only a 2 on scale from 1-5 as it is NOT compatible with Adaptec Software. Software included is on the OK side but sure could be a lot better. Has problems writing at the 6X speed unless more expensive CD's are purchased."
4,"what a great drive for a great price,","This is the 6th CDRW drive I have bought. I planed to give it to my brother for Xmas and I thought about giving him my Sony 8x4x32x so I could keep it for myself. The drive was a RICHO Dive in cendyne packaging. It supports 700mg ""overburning"" and came with Nero 5.0 burning software. If you are a novice to installing hardware this dive might not be the best option for you, as thear is no step by step install guide. If you are looking for a low cost high quality drive this might be the one for you."
3,Okay drive; yucky software,"The drive installed in 5 minutes in a Dell Dimension L box. Simply took out the old CDROM drive and threw the Cendyne in. A snap. It works great. The software is second-rate however. It works okay, but it has many confusing modes, useless wizards, messy UI, confusing array of icons. Very amatuerish. With that said, it seems to work fine. I've burned a few audio CD's and they work great. The other reviewer who said you can't burn data CD's is nuts. Of course, you can."
5,What a great product!,"I'm no computer wiz, but with the easy to follow instructions within an hour I installed and began to burn my own cd's without a single problem. Works like a charm! With it's affordable price and effortless use you can't go wrong."
1,Doesn't work!,"I went through three of these drives and could not get any of them to work properly. I tried them on two PCs under Windows 98. One of the drives would just not burn at all - I kept getting a SCSI/IDE error right away. The others would burn the CD just fine, but they would not read the CD that was just burned. However, my old CD-ROM drive would read the CD that was just burned - go figure! I decided to try more expensive media; however, it was the same disappointing result. Needless to say I returned the drives! Maybe I got unlucky - who knows. I think I'll shell out the money and get one of the more expensive drives and get peace of mind."
2,Will they ever help?,"After getting my drive and installing it trouble free I found that the drive would not operate. I contacted tech support and was told to update ide drivers,which I did, with no change in operation. It has been three weeks with no reply to my problem. I am very disappointed with cendyne."
2,"Great Product. Where's my rebate, Cendyne?","We bought this one because of the great value, figuring in a Manufacturer's rebate from Cendyne. We'll it's been years, and after constant phone calls and emails we've received nothing but promises that it ""will go out in tomorrow's mail."" Other than the lie of a rebate to falsely lower the price we've been very pleased with this burner, and actually they shipped a free upgrade (8x12x52 CD-RW drive) as this model was out of stock. Really good product (4 stars) , dubious marketing (-2 stars)."
1,Wasn't compatable with my computer.,"Sorry, but I can't say anything good about this cd writer.I had to send it back cause it was not compatable and wouldn't work. I have no idea why."
5,So easy to use...no wonder it's number 1 ! LoL!,Seriously I think this is one of the best CD burners out there! Since I've got it I've been making tons of custom mixes in no time! It takes only about 15 minutes to make a CD! It includes easy to use software. And I can gauruntee that you will not find a CD burner that is as good as this and as cheap as this elsewhere!
4,Nice inexpensive CD burner,"The drive is the OEM version (RW7063A) of popular Ricoh/MET MP7063A. The drive works very well even with the cheaper media available on the market (I've tried Ritek and CMC manufactured cheapies). As with other IDE burners without the new Burn-proof option, care should be taken on multitasking while CD is being burned to avoid buffer underruns. The real plus of this burner is the DAE (digital audio extraction) capability. It is able to rip audio tracks at average speed of ~18x (min ~10x, max ~30x). So if you are into creating MP3 files, this drive is for you. Although there are faster drives on the market, this is very nice drive for the price."
5,My Daughter's Favorite Birthday Gift!,"My 8-year-old daughter had so much fun making her pillow...with help from mom of course! It was one of my daughter's favorite birthday gifts, and the pillow now holds a place of honor in her bedroom. It is much cuter in real life than it appears online.I think a 7-year-old may need too much supervision to make this fun, so I would definitely recommend this for the 8 & up age range."
5,Make Your Own Fleece Pillow,"I bought this product for my daughter for Christmas, & she had a blast putting it together. The materials were very easy to work with. All she had to do was cut a fringe around the edges of the fleece, tie the sides together, & then stuff the filling into the top before completely tying the fringe closed. It was a fun, practical, & attractive project . . . & my daughter still enjoys lounging on the pillow even now."
5,True stories ALWAYS make a movie!,"As a once very avid Elvis collector and music history specialist, I must say this movie is worth your attention! Based on the true story and book of a very wonderful woman who works with handicapped children in a special care facility. She meets a young lady (Diane Lane) who is a total fan of Elvis Presley and not only works with her therapy, but her love for Elvis. The unbelieveably true part is that Elvis personally begins to correspond with the young lady through a private mailing address. The complete story is golden, like a fairy tale. But this one is amazingly true, confirmed by the author, Joe Esposito, and once, at a press conference, Elvis, himself. 5 STARS- ALL THE WAY, (and remember the Kleenex box)!"
5,A MUST FOR ANY SERIOUS ELVIS FAN,"It details the life of a special little girl with cerebal palsy and how her love of Elvis made her remaining years joyful. Diane Lane is outstanding. John Amos and Michael Learned give much in supporting roles. While some may find this a weak production, any true Elvis fan will view it as quite an emotional ride and confirmation of the largeness and humbleness of The King of Rock n' Roll. As a ""devout"" Elvis fan he greatly touched my life. This movie, which I treasure, details just how special his life was and how much it meant to so many in so many different ways. Again, it's a must for ANY true Elvis fan."
5,Wonderful and Heart Warming Story of Love and Courage,This is a wonderful story which is a must see for any true romantic at heart or to anyone who love to sit down and enjoy a good tear jerker.
5,Great hard to find movie,"I ordered this as a gift. My sister-in-law mentioned seeing this movie along time ago. She couldn't remember the name, but I found it on Amazon and she is thrilled to have it."
1,Touched by Love,I ordered Touched by Love I received the cover that said Touched by Love and the VHS tape has Touched by Love on it HOWEVER REVIEWED THE MOVIE AND IT IS AN OLD COWBOY AND INDIAN MOVIE WHICH IS NOT WHAT I ORDERED. I ORDERED IN SEPT AS A BIRTHDAY GIFT FOR MY DAUGHTER. JUST REVIEWED IT WITH HER THIS DATE AND FIND IT DISAPPOINTING THAT HER FAVORITE ALL TIME MOVIE IS NOT THEONE I ORDERED AND PAID 38.00 FOR. ADVISE REVIEW MOVIE WHEN YOU GET IT TO AVOID A BIG LET DOWN.
2,"Battery great, installation horrible","The battery is handy to have as a backup and works fine. The mini screwdriver, however, is useless. It doesn't work to open the battery compartment and is more likely to strip out the screw or scratch the back of your SP before it even begins to turn the screw. I'm on the lookout for a replacement screwdriver but for now I use one of those 'eyeglass repair' kits. The screwdriver in there works ok, but I'm sure there's a better one somewhere."
5,so many uses,"Great product.not only should it be a factory option on all trucks.Makes getting in and out of your truck much easier with the tailgate up or down.Sitting on the tailgate down,it makes a great foot rest.Pull it out halfway and it makes a great seat to have lunch with the guys.Again, worth every penny."
3,HitchMate Truck Step,It's just OK in my opinion. I though it would have been sturdier. I think it may be prone to injury if you don't stand directly in the center of the step. Would I purchase again. No.
4,His second solo album,"I remember buying this on vinyl back when it first came out.It has the classics Cinnamon Girl, Down by the River and Cowgirl in the Sand. Neil plays the long versions of course, with five minute guitar solos, just like everyone did back at that time, when the guitar solo was a must. This is when Neil Young came out as a solo artist. It is probably still my favorite Neil Young album of all time.I used to play this over and over. I still bring it out every once in awhile.This CD is truely a classic and one of Neil Youngs best ever"
5,Oh come on.,"It is Neil Young at his best. When you can write, and play that well you won't be sitting around talking about music for yahoos on amazon."
5,Great Album,"I love Neil Young, right from his songwriting to his guitar to his off-key singing. It is hard for me to pick my favorite album, I have many but I probably find myself playing this one more than any others. Simple production, great songs, super guitar, super songs from a great songwriter. What more can you ask."
5,What a relief,"I often buy vinyl records at Amazon, I was a little bit worried for this one, that I ordered before Christmas, because of the negative reviews about pressing defects. I listened to the record and I am happy with it, the vinyl is quiet, very thick cover and great sound. A great addiction to my collection"
1,Very very poor presiing quality.,"I live in France and often order LPs from amazon.com. I encountered exactly the same problems with this LP and ""after the goldrush"" LP. Some monthes ago I encountered the same problem with ""music from the big pink"" reissue on Capitol Records. This time I'll ask for a refund because it's not acceptable such a poor quality pressing for so beautiful remastered sound."
1,"""Cowgirls"" album only?",what crap is that? I want to buy this but you can't sell me the one BEST track on it via download?
5,Neil Young CD,"Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere truly encompasses the sound and brilliance of Neil Young. Certainly an album created in his prime, showing his diversity and skills as a songwriter/singer. A must album for any Neil Young fan..."
3,"I seem to have some defects, too...","I seem to have problems similar to the other reviewers. On side one during ""Cinnamon Girl"" there are several awful sounds. There's one more during the next tune as well. The rest of the side and all of side two seem okay, but come on! What a bitter disappointment.As far as refunds or exchanges go, I'm probably out of luck. I'm in Korea and got it in a local shop. Must be the same pressing (says made in USA).I'd sure like to send Neil a letter about it; I'm sure he'd be pissed too."
5,Birth Of Grunge,"After the confused reaction to NEIL YOUNG,the ex- Buffalo Springfielder decider to use a bar band called the Rockets as the backup band on his next album;renaming them Crazy Horse.The result of their collaboration,EVERYBODY KNOWS THIS IS NOWHERE,is a perfect blend of folk and crunching guitar rock.DOWN BY THE RIVER,COWGIRL IN THE SAND, CINNAMON GIRL and the title track showcased what a underrated guitarist Young is,and the promising new talent Danny Whitten.Billy Talbot and Ralph Molina proved to be a formidable musical backbone. This was the true birth of grunge;Young wore flannel shirts and torn jeans,and played hard long before Seattle made it fashionable.The song RUNNING DRY is another in a long line Young's ""sad songs"" - made even sadder by Bobby Notkoff's violin playing.EVERY KNOWS THIS IS NOWHERE is the first Neil Young classic album . . .of which there would be many more."
3,disappointed..,"I can't understand this fuss about the ""HDCD remastered 24bit sound"" of these Neil Young classics.I've bought them all, and felt disappointed. The booklets are more or less the same as on the previous edition (except that the paper is of worse quality) and as far as the sound is concerned, I can't hear the dramatic improvement everybody's writing about - even on my $25'000 system (!)It's just a bit louder than the previous remasters, but it still sounds muddy most of the time - nothing crisp in there. ""Runnin' Dry"" always sounds like it was recorded on a toaster..As a whole, some parts have been slightly improved, but I wish the Japanese had taken care of the remastering job: this would have been definitely something else."
1,"A book that, attempting to be about digital games and their learning value, is about neither.","When I first got this book, I was hoping to find a much needed argument in favor of the learning and educational benefits of games. Instead I found a lackluster series of marketing-like evangelisms that have neither valid science nor learning theory to back them up. By using a sales-pitch approach in an attempt to convince the reader, this book can do more damage than good to the field of educational videogame design and research. If one really wants to find out about what games have to tell us about learning, I would recommend Jim Gee'sWhat Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacybook instead."
3,Digital version not well done,Always enjoyed the hardcoved edition (5 stars). Recently downloaded the Adobe Acrobat version and found it lacking the functions to efficiently read it on a mobile device with Acrobat Reader for Palm Devices. Publisher failed to tag the file to allow jumps from the Table of Contents to the referenced page. The pagination is also 18 pages off. I would not recommend the digital version if there are plans to read it with a mobile device.
3,But..what do you have to learn?,"The book doesn't explain what you shoul learn, and the flaws of online learning. Much people don't finish the courses, don't read it really, cheat and a lot of things. The author gets his lunchs with this stuff.But I found it interesting"
5,A Must Read for all educators,This book opened my eyes to the new requirements for the New/Next generation to be engaged and connected to learning. It contains great practical reference material too.
5,Don't Let the Didgeridoo Throw You,"If you are in search of truly authentic Scandinavian fiddle styles, look no further. Impeccable bowing and double-stop technique and vocal chanting. An interesting texture is achieved with the odd addition of the didgeridoo, which does not in the least detract from the purity of the well-researched folklore. This album has escaped the sugar-coating of California-New-Age layers that plagues so many other bands in the World Music category. A first-rate work of artistry! By the way, I'd choose this album over the more recent Sjofn."
3,"Not what I had hoped, but I'll try again...","""Bucking the Sun"" starts with the discovery of two bodies and the promise of a mystery to be solved. I was hooked after reading the first chapter. However, the mystery reappeared once in the next 350 pages or so. In the meantime, I learned about dam building, New Deal projects , and Comunist politics of the era.On the plus side, Mr. Doig certainly knows his subjects well. He develops interesting characters and relationships and weaves it all into a complex novel.I was left feeling like I'd been teased with the mystery which turned out to be little more than a footnote. Also, I'd have to say I didn't find the author's style all that easy.On whole, though, the book was worthwhile and I'll try another of his works."
2,Not a great Doig book.,"I thought I would never finish this book. It was very disappointing, mainly because his other books were so great. This had a thin story as an excuse to tell about the dam project which is interesting, I guess, if you're an engineer."
4,An Amazing Novel!,"Like Fort Peck dam, Doig has fashioned a lasting and monumental achievement here. He has done what no dam engineer could--elevate the project to the level of metaphor. I LOVED this book--it's utterly compelling and pure poetry at the same time. I admit haven't read much Doig, but I recently listened to the audio book of ""Bucking The Sun"" read by Will Paton on a car trip, and even abridged, the book still has a tremendous impact. Long may Ivan Doig wave!"
4,Doig makes the Dirty 'Thirties come to life on the page,"This is the second Ivan Doig novel I've read. In ""Dancing at the Rascal Fair"" I learned a lot more about sheep-herding than I ever thought I would like, but like it I did. In fact, I loved it, 5 stars worth. In this book I learned a lot more about how those big Western dams were built than I ever thought I would like, but only 4 stars for this one.Doig is a wonderful popular historian, well worth reading on whatever topic he decides on. He took on a difficult story here. He got the history right but it's still a difficult read. Several times as I was reading ""Bucking the Sun"" I wondered if he introduced the mysterious Duff adultery/homicide at the beginning just to keep us reading to the end.I'll be reading more Ivan Doig, that I know. He has the knack of making history come alive, even when the history is as gritty as the story of the Great Depression and how people lived through it -- or didn't."
1,COULDN'T FINISH--SORRY,"MADE IT THRU 113 PAGES---I WAS VERY UNINTERESTED.I, REALLY, DIDN'T CARE WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DAMOR THE FAMILY MEMBERS--SORRY.I TOOK THE BAIT BUT DOIG COULD NOT SET THE HOOK."
1,Never got it,"Well I was in need a good air hose and when you order it you ussualy anticipate resonable shipment, after they got my money they told me that it was damged and it would take unitl feb.( jan 12 is today) who needs an air hose (or any tool) in a month. I guess when the advertise free shipping they forgot to mention the it would be on the back of a mule,"
3,works but too stiff,"Bottom line is it's working, but I have to make the coil shaped hose straight all the time. The rolled hose catches air guns and other stuffs on the floor. And makes the flooring staple gun down on the floor all the time and leaves a mark on the wood floor. It's even worse on cold temperature. Porter-Cable needs to make it more flexible."
1,very very very unhappy customer,I ordered this hose because it had protecttive sleeves and said porter cable on it(to match my compressor). What I got was a plain red rubber hose with no sleeves! Who cares if it comes in porter cable packaging. ITS NOT WHAT I BOUGHT !!!!!!! I could have bought a plain red hose 1 mile down the road for a lot less money ! Apparently they think its ok to swap items.......ITS NOT AND IM EXTREMLY MAD !!!!!!!! UPDATE: Ordered hose straight from porter cable(who said he had the right hose with name/sleeves and still got a different hose ! Good luck with this product !
5,perfect for the weekend warrior,"I bought this product about a year ago, and have used it numerous times when I worked on my truck, or for construction. I've never had any issues with the hose. It's durable, flexible, and has quality brass fittings which easily accept different sized air fittings. would definitely purchase again"
5,Well made 3/8 rubber hose!,"I had previous problems with the threaded connections on a yellow 50 foot GoodYear hose I purchased at Amazon, so I returned it and bought this one to replace it. And so far, this hose is working great. It lays flat in cold weather and all of my fittings will actually screw on all the way."
1,still a Poor Man's Usher,"nothing has really changed with this cat.Vocally He just doesn't move me&His Music seems just kinda there to me.but ""What's your Flava"" is the best cut He has done thus far to me.Very New Jack Swing early 80's vibe going.had He gone more in that direction I think He might have gotten out of the shadows of sounding like a Usher clone.Sting can't save Him either.for His sake I hope His Music lives up to the title but I seriously doubt it."
2,Self-Obsessed Craig Craig Craig,"This CD was a huge disappointment. Craig David's first CD was innovative and had a background of jazzy feel to it. This one is more R&B;/hip-hop/i-don't-know-what-but-i-don't-get-it.Practically every track makes some reference to ""me"" or ""Craig David.""The only decent song is the title song, and even that is not very unique. I'm sad that Craig can't do any better."
4,Worth buying,"This CD was definitely worth the buy, however, I also own the first album of Craig's. His first album was soooooo good, Born to Do It. This album is great, but not as good as the first. I am hoping that his next iss better.There are many upbeat songs on this album. HIs first album was more ballads, which I enjoy."
3,Good but not better than the 1st,"The love songs, as on his first album are great. I have a problem with our buddy when he goes into his money, cars, blah, blah, blah songs. It sounds like something Jay Z would come up with. I like ""what's your flava?"" (which I believe originated from Wu Tang Clan's ""Ice Cream""). I'll give him credit as someone living in Europe who goes to the UK to party. The songs are nice in the club. For those of you who liked his last album because of the love songs, I'd suggest NOW by Maxwell."
3,smooth soundz,"personally i think ""born to do it"" was a lot better than his new one...but this one is ok and i would recommend buying! hott beatz, romance every thing all on one cd! my favorite track is #8 personal.. real smooth and romantic for all those playz! well i hope you enjoy the cd because i know i did!"
3,BORN TO DO IT WAS GREAT WHAT HAPPENED ?,"I LOVED BORN TO DO IT. SO WHEN SLICKER THAN YOUR AVERAGE CAME OUT I RUSHED TO BUY IT. IT WAS OKAY BUT IT DIDNT DO WHAT THE FIRST CD DID FOR ME. I LIKED IT BUT, I LOVED BORN TO DO IT AND I FEEL CRAID COULD HAVE DONE BETTER. STOP LISTENING TO THE CRITICS AND FOLLOW YOUR HEART!"
2,[bad]!,"Not the best music EVER made. But most certainly has comedy value, its just so bad its interesting. Whats your flava, tell me whats your flava OOOOHHHH.Whats so hilarious is the way that Craig David seems to think he's a genius. He's not.He also seems to have a superiority complex. It is people like this who are destroying our music world, people!BOYCOTT MODERN MUSIC!"
5,Done it again,"Well what can I say, Craig David is flossin' again, for all you people out there that have never heard of him, you guys are really missing out. His new CD is right up there with his first. He has 4 songs that can easily go platinum here, anyways, this dawg is off da hook, so you all better recognize alright, later,Big Jay"
5,I loved this album!,"I loved the album by Craig David titled ""Slicker than your Average"". I have wanted it for a couple of years, but I couldn't find it anywhere else but at Amazon.com. I really appreciate your site and the reasonable prices. The album receives definite five stars from me because of the artist and his slick lyrics. Plus the music, the melody, and the imagination he adds to his creations. I recommend this album to anyone and everyone. I thank you once again."
4,Craig is back and showing his influences and changes,"From the moment the disc started I kept hearing Craig's(and his producers')debt to Terence Trent Darby and Michael Jackson. Does anyone agree with me? I grew up with Michael's music and then later with Darby's. I think this is an excellent disc showing a major star's path to maturity in terms of experience and inspiration. ""Rise and Fall"" is truly excellent as most of the other customer reviews have indicated. I do agree with one who said that Born to Do It might end up having a longer shelf-life, but this is a superb follow up to a brilliant recording."
5,This album is addicting,"Well first off let me say that i love craig david, hes incredably talented. Ok now to the album, this album is so addicting, i havent stopped listening to it since i bought it, i have to listen to it atleast 3 times a day. The song you dont miss your water (till the well runs dry) is my favorite, its a very sweet song. This album has all the flavors of craig, his rap, 2 step and r&b. its just an all around great album. I highly suggest it for everyone."
3,"No, No Too Slick","This #2 CD by Craig is no where as good as his first. He has lost his unique sound, just trying to imitate every other rapper. The CD sounds formulaic, drum-machine monotony. Ok, a few cuts are good (2 Steps Back, for example) but I am soooooo disappointed."
1,terrible,"im sick of seeing this guy prancing around on my tv screen, and listening to him whining like a trapped goat on the radio. who does he think he is? im sure he is having a great time 'rapping' about his money and big cars, do u know why that is? its beacuse he is funded by screaming 12 year old girls. this cd is sicker than your average."
5,Off DA HooK,There are no other words to describe this CD than off da hook. It's got the sickest beats and rhymes and no lies it's the CD I've been listening to ever since I bought it two weeks ago! So if you haven't checked it out yet be sure to do so cuz tracks like Personal and Spanish just make this CD too hot too handle!... SSSSSSSSSssssssss...
5,Slicker Than His Last CD,"Craig David... you are an absolute genius with this album.. the smoothness, the style and the emphasis on rnb is clearly seen in this albulm."
5,THE BEST R&B SINGER I HAVE EVER HEARD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Craig David, has undoubtedly become my most favorite R&B singer of all time. His voice is amazing. What I am most captivated by is how he pics THE BEST HARMONIES IN THE WORLD, to go with what he is singing. Example (You're only gonna mess things up, you've done enough, why can't you stop). What he sings, plus the background singing (which haronizes beautifully) is the most amazing sound thing ever. If you like soft R & B, you shouldn't waste a single second, go out and buy this Album. Not only is he a great R&B artist, but he does a little rap as well. Hands down, best album ever. It is so good, that I have left it in my car since I bought it and everytime I drive somewhere, it is the music that I listen to."
3,A very different album from Born To Do It...,"It's no surprise that expectations for Craig David's second album would be high following his successful debut 'Born To Do It'. While it is still too early to speculate the degree of success 'Slicker Than Your Average' will experience, it would be unfair to compare STYA with BTDI because they are so different. I don't care much for the title track but standout tracks include:Hidden AgendaYou Don't Miss Your Water ('Til The Water Runs Dry)Rise and Fall (feat. Sting)Two Steps BackWhat's ChangedWorld Filled With Love...Six tracks out of thirteen ain't bad but I find the rest of the album to be filler material... It is obvious that Craig has grown musically and should be praised for experimenting but it just didnt' work for me. Having said all that, the album is worth purchasing just for 'Rise and Fall' featuring Sting, it contains samples from 'Shape Of My Heart' and certainly the highlight!"
2,No no. It's just average.,"When Born To Do It premiered in the US last year, it was a daring crossover success -- mixing enough uk garage 2-step beats with proper R&B production and smooth lyrical skills. Unfortunately, the follow-up is seemingly less about the perfect intimate bonding of 2-step with R&B and more about the bonding between R&B and what R. Kelly is reminded of. The opening single ""What's Your Flava?"" is probably the tightest on the album as it bounces through fun lyrics about different shades of women -- it's Raekwon's 1995 tune ""Ice Cream"" recycled for 2002/3. While Craig might've taken that chancier step into more gangster territory, he forewent the unison with ex-producer Mark Hill (of uk garage Artful Dodger fame) this time and got caught in a slump. Possible other hits would be ""Eenie Meenie"" or the interesting duet with Sting, but radio and will probably pass."
5,Dig those fiendishly fun sounds!,"I love this CD to death! It's got surf, rockabilly, and even some macabre mambo music. This is hauntingly hip halloween party music you'll want to play all year round.It also features a spoken intro by Zacherley, the famous TV Horror Host from the fifties. He also sits in with the crazy fun Southern Culture on the Skids for some spoken word on the track, Sinister Purpose.This is one of those CD's I put in the player and hit repeat all tracks and start working at the computer, because I enjoy all of it. I just have to get up from working occassionally to dance around madly. The artwork inside and out on the CD is also very killer, very retro creature feature-esque.Fun stuff!"
5,Surf's Up on Creepy Halloween Tunes!,"""Halloween Hootenanny"" is an eerie compilation of songs that makes you feel like you're on a beach at night doing the twist and sipping on a Werewolf's Eye martini. This album is all about mood and it transports you to a bygone era when Halloween was still mysterious, exciting, and DARK. As bubbly and upbeat 1960s-style as many of these songs are, they almost all have a creepy vibe that brings you back to the old days when Halloween was all about vampires, devils, monsters, and mischief. The tracklist starts with a spoken word selection by late night horror host Zacherley and it sets the ""classic but strange"" tone of the album. ""Halloween Hootenanny"" is great for dancing, listening to while drinking with friends, blasting on Halloween, or cruising around on a crisp autumn night."
3,Re: Hallowe'en Hootenany,"Not bad, but for an even better Hallowe'en selection I recommend the CD for ""Return of the Living Dead."" That music rocks!"
2,So So,"It just isn't great music and the sound is so so. One certainly can't dance to it, live and learn."
5,STAB STAB STAB DEATH DEATH DEATH ROCK ROCK ROCK SURF SURF SURF!,Every song on this CD is perfect to rock out on Halloween with.. BUT what I want to know is WHY and HOW did SURF music end up associated with HORROR and HALLOWEEN! I mean it started in the fifties with bands like BOBBY BORIS PICKET and the KRYPT KICKERS and THE BLOBS etc. but why?Check out THE FAMOUS MONSTERS you'll love it if you like this CD.. it's SEAN YSEULT from WHITE ZOMBIE's surf band!
4,GOT GOATS????,"NICE ALBUM, GREAT FOLLOW UP TO AN EVEN BETTER DEBUT. GET TRICKS OF THE SHADE FIRST AND THEN PICK THIS ONE UP TO COMPLETE THE COLLECTION."
1,WIGGITY WACK,"This is to elevating the fusion of jazz,turntable(ism),rap and rock (shlock) as Kid Rock (shlock) is to elevating the human race. Jack off all trades......master of wack."
4,Good if you like Anne McCaffrey,"I'm a Dragonriders geek, so I enjoyed this. Not sure how it stacks up to other SciFi authors, but I liked it."
5,Restoree,"RestoreeWhat a fascinating syfy story. I originally read this book 10 years ago and at least 3 times over that time frame.I re-ordered the book when my copy started falling apart. I always thought this story would have made a good movie.Danger, mystery and romance all in one book."
5,A very nifty story by Ms. McCaffrey!,"I have a '67 copy of this book...much the worse for wear from many readings. Since she has gone on to expound on quite a few of her earlier works, I would love to see her do the same with this one. Sara & Harlan are a great two-some and I still think of this as one of my favorite works of hers. Easily read, it is more than capable of standing alone. A must for any McCaffrey fan."
5,You just gotta love Sara,"OK, OK, so the plot has holes. Yes, the villans are straight out of a comic book. So what? The SF setting and plot are just the framework for a love story - and a very nice one it is, too. Unlike most books, the hero is secondary. Our heroine, Sara, is the star of the book. Intelligent, observant, and compassionate, she is thrust into a new and frightening world. To add to the confusion, she's always been ugly, but is suddenly beautiful. Who is the patient in this wierd hospital, and what should she do?Restoree could just as easily been set in Nazi Germany, or any number of settings. Irrelevant. This is above all a love story, and one you will want to revisit. It's a crying shame there has never been a sequel."
3,FIGHT KINDLE PRICE GOUGING!,"It's worth reading but not at the Kindle price. No paper, no ink, no glue, no fuel costs, no Text-to-speech. Do yourself a favor buy a used paperback. Don't support the ""Publishers"" price gouging. No TTS, $3.99. with TTS $5.99 max."
3,Crayola Clock,I bought this clock for my 6 year old daughter for Xmas and was a little disappointed. Overall it is a great first time clock for a child with the changeable front cover and music to listen to with the sleep timer but somewhat hard to use. The directions that come with it are hard to see and just give pictures. I had a hard time programming it and thought it was broken becuase I was not able to set the alarm or get it to record my daughters message. But with trial and error figured it out. What was most disappointing was that I understood the clock to have the ability to have music as the wake up for the alarm but that is not the case. Only the buzzer which my daughter does not like becuase it is too loud.
5,UK Dub begins here!,"New Age Steppers was the original UKDUB group. Ari Up & Adrian Sherwood were the moving force behind this incredible, dark (usually but with SOME bright spots) spaceym bass & drum driven atmospherics...you can't go wrong with this!"
4,HEAVEN,"heaven...heaven...""heaven"" must be the ultimate groove on this hypnotic classical jungle journey. Two cd's one mixed one unmixed. If you're just exploring the large logistic world of jungle, Promised Land will take you there. jacinta@poetic.com"
4,Take a trip to the...,"I made this purchase after listening to Pandora and realizing that many of the great songs being played were on this compilation. I was very impressed to find even more gems on the 2-disc volume. DJ Crystl, Adam F, Voyager and Big Bud all supply amazing tracks on the Promised Land. I even purchased the other two Promised Land compilations (Vols. I and III) and I found Vol. I to be slightly better than this one. I highly recommend purchasing at least one of the compilations."
3,Not to bad,"This was a good old movie but i'm afraid after you've seen Love finds Andy Hardy, the rest don't seem as funny. Overall, it is wonderful, because Mickey Rooney is in it, but it lacks the charm of when Andy was home at Carville and girl crazy. In this he acts a little more 'mature' and 'of the world.'Mickey plays Andy Hardy in this film. While away at college Andy falls head over heels in love with Kay (Bonita Granville) And at first you think she loves him back but suddenly she dumps him for a much older man Dane Kittredge. Though a little depressing, still a wonderful movie. And you'll love it when 5'2 Andy dances with a 6'3 girl and she's throwing him all around!!! Hilarious!!!!"
5,Funny!,I love this movie! It was funny watching the dancing. I hope you can have the other movies with M.R. put on DVD's.
2,Love Laughs at Andy Hardy--slim case,The story line and general production quality is good; there are some scenes out of sequence. I purchased a different dvd by the same title and it did not contain the sequence problem.
3,charming but dated,"Mickey was an underrated actor but this film is a little silly for a modern audience. Not without charm, however."
3,huh?,"there must be something i missed.... i bought the book...thinking it would be like the lone ranger. Instead, it's like the lone ranger meets ron jeremy. i guess i was misled by ""all action western novel."" it's not very suspenseful and a bit corny, but if you want a book that takes two hours or so to read and gives you a few cheap thrills, then go ahead. But i wouldn't reccomend spending $...on it; buy it used."
2,Not the best buy.,"This charm looks pretty straight from the box, but that's about it. The day after I got it, the clasp broke and the ""abalone shell"" had a deep scratch in it, just from doing laundry. I would not recommend that anyone else buy this."
3,Not so much,"It all pales before ""The Prophet"" That inspired work put KG in my hero-philosopher column. I found The Madman to be tepid by comparison."
2,"fantastic literature, poor book","this is one of my favorite books of all time, but this particular binding is riddled with typos, so if that bothers you, I recommend buying a different one."
4,a bit of wisdom,this book is amazing. gibran has a sense of wisdom in his words that makes us think about who we really are. truly a beautiful work.
1,The Madman Reprint by Kessinger Publishing,"I ordered a reprint from Kessinger Publishing of ""The Madman"" and find that it is not reprinted like the original. Instead, some juvenile editor arranged the sequence of chapters and lines to fit the warped ideas found in his mind. That gives him or her a boost up by assuming that he or she has a mind. Kessinger should be ashamed to call this a ""Legacy Reprint."" I ordered the book from Barnes and Noble and will return it for a refund.Lew R. CookPhoenix, AZ"
4,Sonny and Cher they aren't.,"This short album (just six tracks), produced by Pat McDonald and Barbara K, who also performed as Timbuk3, has fun stuff on it. Most notably, there's a new version of the group's best known song, ""The Future's So Bright, I Gotta Wear Shades."" A cover of Steppenwolf's ""Born to Be Wild"" fits the group's take-no-prisoners attitude. An acoustic version of ""Sunshine Is Dangerous,"" which preceded the version that opened the group's great album, ""A Hundred Lovers,"" is also worth hearing. If you like other material by this group, you won't regret getting this album."
2,Pickup in South Africa,"Take the plot of Pickup on South Street, fluff it up with sixties schlock, and what puffs forth is a colory, crime-does-pay piece that looks more like a Doris Day comedy than a caper flick. Imagine James Brolin in a role made memorable by Richard Widmark, and the picture's problem becomes even clearer. About the only shade left of noir here is the motivation of communist menace and the casting of Claire Trevor. Her presence is of little help to the effort, however, as she is blowzied out as an apparent ex-hooker in a role that makes a mockery of Thelma Ritter's previous portrayal of a dowdy, world-weary peddler. Even Brolin's waterfront shack looks like a fumigated, cleaned-by-mom clubhouse where, thanks to modern indulgence, nude pinups remain taped cutely cocky to the walls. Ho hum. If the movie was less than gaudy, it could be labeled film blanc."
5,"Moody, cool, and brilliant","As a horror-film afficionado, it's always a pleasure to come across a movie that is solidly crafted and doesn't insult your intelligence. Asia has produced several remarkable films in the horror genre, and this one is definitely one of the best. It has all the elements of a classic - atmosphere, music, premise. I won't give the plot away. Enjoy!"
1,I've had enough of this genre,"It was too slow paced, cliched, and full of plot holes. I also found the characters vapid and not very likable, something that has become a common denominator among Japanese horror films."
3,Creepy and flawed,"Kurosawa's films are quite wonderful, and Seance comes close to that level. A mood of quiet and eerie tension is created and sustained throughout the film. The cast is superb, as is the deliberately slow pacing and the underplayed horror. Unfortunately, the film is seriously marred by a plot point which occurs near the halfway mark. Lacking any dramatic or common sense, this choice drives, but completely fails to justify, the last act of the movie. I do not know if the film's written source follows the same construction, but what's here is severely damaged by the couple's decision(s) about how to deal with the crisis. It's too bad because Seance would have been a much stronger entry."
4,A masterful performance from our favorite Berklee rockers,"I wish the album contained more unreleased tracks from Falling to Infinity. I suppose the video 5 Years in a Livetime makes up for it. What is on the cd is increadable, although I wanted something else."
2,"I love them, but this album sucks!","As a die hard fanatic I am forced to decry Once in a Live Time with a heavy heart. It is true that both discs have a walloping amount of material, but Kevin Shirley's mixing was for crap. Derek Shirinian's keys were too high in the mix, often drowning out the other player's efforts with too much volume. Mike Portnoy's killer drumming was muffled with little color coming from his toms or snare. I place the sound quality of the 6 song EP live at the Marquee high above OIALT. The Marquee's sound was brilliant. Portnoy's drums shone with clarity and force and the other players were shimmering in the spotlight as well. Sorry DT, but my voice must be heard. And lose Shirley!!!"
1,Jameses vocals are the pits on this album!!!!,"Let me start off by saying I am one of the biggest DT fans in the world. I cannot beleive that the guy's actually released this album. The band sounds as awsome as ever. BUT Jameses vocals absoulutly suck. His range is overextended on all the songs but ESPECIALLY on take the time. I really love these guys and I hope, no, I pray that the next live album will showcase everyones musical ability. Not just the instruments but the vocals as well."
3,"Great music, but it has it's quirks","Don't get me wrong, this is a great album and I love DT, but it has it's problems. The biggest problem with this album is it's sound quality. It seems that every time the music gets intense, the audio gets fuzzy and compressed. Also dissappointing was Mike Portnoy's drum solo. It is simply a blur of unorganized notes. John's guitar solo is quite good, as long as you don't pay attention to his timing. I would recommend Awake or Images and Words anyday over this album."
5,words fail me,I must say this album and its music will revive your spirt. its best enjoyed sharing it with others who have never heard it.
2,Sort of a let down,"I love Dream Theater, but Once in a Livetime is a letdown as far as live recordings go. The mixing is pretty bad, LaBrie's vocals are forced, and Petrucci's guitar is hidden most of the time. One of the best live albums I've ever heard is UFO's Strangers in the Night...that is how to record a live album, and in 1978! Anyway, there are a few good points on the album, the best being Petrucci's 8 minute guitar solo which simply blows me away as he melds some DT, Liquid Tension Experiment, and some classical music into one heart stopping solo!"
1,Whish I hadn't bought this.,This is the worst 80s rock I've ever forced my self to listen to. If you want this kind of music do bug with dream theater just buy some Rush.
2,Not impressed,This CD is just ok. They playing is just great. What really bugs me is the drumming. My lord can you double kick enough? Has to be the worst drumming I have heard in quite some time. It really detracts form the music. If it was not for the drumming I would give this CD 4 or 5 stars but because of it it only gets 2 stars. Other then the drummer the players on this CD are top notch and tight. I was impressed with the overall sound of the band. The singer needs to calm down a bit. Dump the drummer and you will have a great band!
5,Outstanding and Amazing!!!,"This album showcases the talent of five of the best musicians on the planet...live. You don't have to love their musical style to appreciate their talent. I listen in awe every time. If you appreciate music of all kinds, give Dream Theater a chance....you'll be hooked!!!"
2,Put a hurt on my ears....,"I love DT, but this disc contains versions of many of these songs that are lackluster and occasionally, just plain bad. James destroys his voice on ""Voices"" (how ironic) and most of the other songs I've heard performed MUCH better than this on imports or on video. Gave it two stars just because it's DT and there are some good spots, but I'd like to see them apply the ""quality not quantity"" rule a lot more. Pass."
2,"Among, if not the WORST Dream Theater show.","When I first heard this, Marqee was all the live DT I had ever heard. I was shaking in fear at what I heard. Now I know why it sucks so much.Tension in the band reached a point where, hours before the night of this show, Mike Portnoy announced to the band that he was leaving the band. He would however, see out the European tour dates. This show really blows. I may never have heard one so bad from DT. Not even close. Buy this album just to destroy it in new and exciting ways. Or if you're a completest who wants DT's worst release around on your shelf, at least get it last.DT are better than this show.I have it, each CD is separate from the other, sitting in a box full of crap somewhere. And if I want to hear what a band sounds like when they are collectively at the breaking up point. I'll give it a listen, but I don't."
2,Awful Live Recording,"Musically, this album was very good. These guys can perform live like no others. But this album sounded like it was recorded with a cheap handheld recorder."
4,Not as Good as Marquee,"I'm a dedicated fan of the all-mighty DT, and personally think they can do no wrong. However, this album (and When Dream and Day Unite, by the way), is the one DT I was really kind of disappointed by. The album was recorded on the Falling Into Infinity tour, and likewise contains many songs from that release, and also consequently features the overrated Derek Sherinian on keyboards. (While Mr. Sherinian is certaintly good, he ruined Dream Theater after Kevin Moore.) The album contains several interesting jams, including one of Skynyrd's Freebird (my fave on the CD), and features unbelievable guitar work from Petrucci. Other high points include the Metropolis medley that closes the album, and the inclusion of Yste Jam. The acoustic set, and a few of the songs from FII could've been done without though. On the whole a good greatest hits live type collection, but I feel that those wanting to get an accurate representation of DT live should get the Live at The MArquee EP."
5,had to write one due to the previous reviewer,"because he is out of his mind in saying that James Labrie's vocals are terrible. I'll admit at times on other live releases, i.e. Score he isn't as consistent but on this he's pitch perfect so I don't get what the Labrie hating is for. As for the rest of the album, it is incredible. Great song selection and excellent musicianship and the Petrucci solo (HOLY COW!) is that amazing. All in all, if you like Dream Theater, get this album. You won't regret it."
1,Not the correct Frank Pearson book,"The description of this book and the Chapter page are completely different than that of the Frank Pearson ""Food"" book for which it is attributed. Also, he died about 50 years before (1965) it's release date, so someone has made a big mistake in listing this book under this detail page. If you want the Frant Pearso book, look at the 1944 edition. He was born in 1923, so the one that claimed it was written before 1925 was not his either."
1,I have not bought this product but.. the color interface does not work,I whould love to start colecting eyeshadows but since most of the names are in french I don't know what the colors look like. this is very fustrating. fix this!
4,still boggled,"I still have trouble wrapping my head around the immensity! That said, the book carries the mantle of the earlier works quite comfortably. I felt that this is a first-class example of 'true' science-fiction; ie, this could work. My recommendation would include all sci-fi fans and anyone who likes action writing. This is good stuff!"
3,Not one of Niven's best but ok if you like Niven.,"Continues the story of Louis Wu and the Ringworld. The plot gets overly complicated and if you haven't read the other Ringworld stories you'll be utterly lost. If, however you like the careful way Niven's universes are constructed and his style of story telling it's a pleasant read."
4,Still a great read,"It's been years since I've read a Niven book, but it was still as great as I remember. The characters, events, and locations are very memorable so you drop back into known space very quickly and pick up where you left off. The science remains right, which is always a Niven trademark. I can't wait to get started on ""FLeet of Worlds""!"
4,"Not his best, but definitely worth the journey...","I didn't see the disjointedness that some other reviewers are claiming, I felt the book had a healthy, mostly linear pathway from beginning to end. I wouldn't place it with my favorite Niven books, but I definitely enjoyed it and felt the ending made a great finale to the Ringworld story (assuming that's what it is)."
3,Misses the mark,"Ringworld's Children is half a book. The first half was the previous ""Ringworld Throne."" Unfortunately, Niven didn't combine them, toss out the filler in ""Throne"", and write the book that would have been the worthy successor to ""Ringworld"" and ""Ringworld Engineers."" But he didn't, and the two half books don't make a whole one.What we have instead is (like ""Throne"") the outline of a great novel, a few sketches of characters (and not even that for some: Chmee's son whatsisname), and Louis Wu solving a few puzzles with clues we never see.Larry Niven once said that the Ringworld offered so many opportunities for sequels that it would make Edgar Rice Burroughs look like a case of ""writer's block."" Sadly, having created such a mental playground, Niven is unable to capitalize on it.3 stars because it's Ringworld. But only just."
1,A waste of time,"What is it about aging Science Fiction writers that they become so obsessed with sex? It happened to Heinlein, and sadly, it's happening to Niven, two of my favorite authors from childhood.I've read most of Niven's work, loved all his known space series, even if he's made some serious physics blunders, and loved Ringworld and Ringworld Engineers. Ringworld Throne would have been a short story if you ripped out every page with his twisted interspecies sex fantasies, and I promosed myself that I would toss Rindworld's Children if I encountered a single scene of gratuitous rishathra that didn't propel the plot line.Surprisingly, I got through half the book, but that sucker is on the curb for recycling as I write this.Larry, get a ticket to Thailand, get yourself thoroughly laid, and then write your next story."
3,The Ringworld series ends,"This book is an improvement on Ringworld Throne, which isn't saying much. There still aren't new striking ideas, but this time Niven brought in ideas from earlier in his career (tricks with hyperdrive, loony ARMS officers), and made it look like he had planned it that way. And the elaborate cover story that Louis comes up with sounds almost like the plan of an unwritten Ringworld novel. Finally some mysteries are finally tied up neatly:(SPOILERS!)Why did Teela die in spite of her ""luck""? Because the Teela Brown gene was protecting ITSELF, not her -- Dawkins' selfish gene theory.Why don't the Ringworld Protectors show the xenophobia that they did in PROTECTOR? Because they did genetic engineering on themselves to eliminate the trait.Still, to paraphrase TS Eliot, the RINGWORLD ended not with a bang but with a whimper."
2,Only slightly better than Throne,"Not quite the crapfest that was book 3 in the Ringworld series, but still a gigantic disappointment coming from Niven. Children is plagued by the same things that made the previous novel so unbearable: flat, uninteresting characters, ridiculous names, obsession over interspecies sex for no reason other than to include sex in the story, and overall a poorly written plot. To be fair, I didn't come out of this one as bewildered as after Ringworld Throne - don't even ask me to summarize THAT plot, I've yet to come across a decent one myself, mostly because trying to figure it out can cause lasting brain damage. But even so, this novel is nowhere near the original Ringworld novel, or even Engineers for that matter. Avoid if possible."
1,Not worth reading,"I used to read a lot of science fiction, and I enjoyed Larry Niven's stories. While he wasn't a great writer, he had interesting ideas, and I enjoyed his books. I enjoyed Ringworld years ago.I read the negative reviews and had low expectations for this book. Unfortunately this book failed to meet them.I did not like the story, nor did I find the characters interesting. Had this not been a Larry Niven book I would not have finished it."
2,The most disappointing Ring World book,"This trip to Ringworld was a disappointment. The character and the plot development was weak and shallow. Niven had the material to flesh out the story, but, for some reason failed to use it. When I reached the end of the book I wondered where the rest of the story was. This is definitely not his best effort. (...)"
2,Waste of time,"Loved the original Ringworld book and have read all the sequals. Unfortunately I could have skipped this one. No plot, no character developement and the ""story"" could have taken place in any space setting, no need for the Ringworld.It's time to leave this series alone and appreciate it for what it is, not try to make some money off it's reputation."
2,Not up to his standards,This was not a great read. The first half of the book read like someone with ADD describing a video game. The last half of the book is wildly disjointed. Not a great way to end the Ringworld series.A big part of the disappointment is missed expectations. I loved this series. Waited a long time for this book - and it's just a poor read.
3,One of my favorite authors,"A great addition to the ringworld series.But disappointing in a few, hard to explain ways.Maybe the characters and setting are so clear to Larry that developing them seemed unnecessary.It's fast paced and grand in its scope, detailing the fragility of the ring very well. But I felt the sense of wonder at encountering new species and situations was missing.This is likely my high expectations.To be clear, I'd read this again and again, because I really liked the initial novel and characters. It's a good story too.But maybe its a little thin.Seems almost like it's written as anaction movie script, --it'd be a good one."
2,"confusing story - should be great, but isn't","Niven had some great ideas for this story, I feel sure. Unfortunately, he couldn't get them on paper in an understandable way. The story jumps around, and goals / motivations of the characters are always unclear. All of this series but the original Ringworld suffer from this problem, but this one is the worst."
3,"Cute, but not safe","I bought this for the SP we got my 4 year old for christmas. He loves it, wears it around his neck...but it has opened by itself and the gameboy has fallen out on the ground. Not real safe for and expensive toy. It only holds 2-3 games, no accessories. It is really a cute little case, maybe better for an older person, that would be more careful with it..."
2,get rhinoskin instead,"i was looking for a case for my son's gba sp. rhinoskin makes one that is anodized aluminum. fits perfectly, and you can still play the game while it is in this cover."
2,Does it's job,"The only reason I bought this case was due to the fact that it was made of aluminum. I thought it would be a nice, sturdy case that I could keep my SP in. Unfortunately I am very disappointed. The case looks and feels very cheap. The metal is very thin and doesn't feel sturdy. But it will hold a Gameboy just fine, if that's all you want."
4,Tough Case,"if your looking for a very tough this is the one, it really can take a beating there is only room for gameboy and a couple of games, a great case for kids who take it everywhere"
4,Could have been better...,"Marie is the best, but this is one Osmond album I can't give 5 stars! It's too country for me. I love the pop songs from Marie. Although most of her ""country"" songs are fun and uplifting this selection is rather boring and unrememberable. ""Steppin stone"", ""A too blue moon"" & ""Slowly but surely"" are pretty good though. For $5.98, you can't complain too much!!"
4,Her 4th and Final Capitol Release of the 80's,"In 1989, the 4th MO CD was released with a more sophisticated original feel compared to her prior releases. The material is not as strong, but stands up to her prior efforts. The singles were Steppin' Stone (#70) reminiscent of her 90's hit Like A Hurricane, Slowly But Surely (#75) and Let Me Be The First. The lead song What Would You Do About You was a B side and then flipped for airlplay without great success. Perhaps they would have been better to release If You Think About It Call Me or Love Speaks Louder Than Worlds?"
1,pointless movie,"I want to thank reviewer Jeffrey Leach for helping me gain a tiny insight into this film. Without his informing me that this was a satire of American radicalism, I would have guessed it was somebody's high school film project - that got an F. I'd give it a zero, but this system won't go that low.The question the movie leaves me and the friends who sat through this is why would Danny Glover or Peter Coyote agree to this project?"
2,Buyer Pay Attention... I didn't,"This item is not as pictured. As the item title states ""Benefiber Pwdr 4gm Pkt (Case)"", it is Benefiber in individual 4g (single serving) packets with 75 packets to a case (or box?). ""Product Features"" describes it as ""Boxes Per Case 75"" which is actually 75 packets per case. This is a confusing description and misleading photo.Benefiber is a great product but it is difficult to find a bulk quantity if you plan, as I do, to use it for a long time."
4,Between Darkness and Wonder,trip hop is a kind of music that is going to desappear but this CD has very good quality music. The voice of Lou Rhodes is unique!
4,Newest Lamb Album Shines,"If you enjoyed Lamb's previous album, What Sound, you might want to pick up their newest release, Between Darkness and Wonder. It's a departure from their older releases, but it is still definitely Lamb. This album takes a bit more listening to get into, but the latter half is really worth waiting for. (From Please until the end of the album...words can't even describe) The remix-Debussy stuff from Track 4 is a little Moby-ish, but overall this CD is excellent. If you're not willing to fork over the import price, shoot for What Sound instead, as it is a stronger, more accessible album. BD&W is worth it if you're a die hard fan."
2,more cloying sounds from a newly spit-polished Lamb,"Let's just say that I miss the upright bass and jazzy sounds of the first two albums. Although ""Darkness"" is less cloying than the almost vomit-inducing (in my opinion) ""What Sound,"" it is only a baby step away...The first and third tracks caught my ear, but by ""Angelica"", (which is merely one phrase of a Debussy piano piece set to a beat and repeated over... and over....), my attention was drifting. I have no idea what happened, but this is not the same Lamb that produced one of my favorite songs of all time, the soaring, epic, ""Gorecki,"" but a once-interesting and innovative group pushing for popular, Dido-sized and -shaped success. My advice: bring back the wooden bass, Lamb! I'm begging you! And for all you peops interested in this band, pick up Lamb's first 2 albums. They are guaranteed to please!"
4,Flimsier than I'd hoped.,"This set can make the crane truck, but not multiple projects. Its not 50 models at the same time. The shaft collars are weak, when you have gears driving gears they should have screw locking collars instead of rubber and plastic collars. The instructions are a little weak also. My son, 6 yrs old, enjoyed the building but was disappointed in the functionality."
1,as poorly designed as a toy could be,The greatest virtue of this educational toy is that it teaches about frustration annd the implementation of poorly laid plans. While individual pieces are made very well the design is garbage and the best construction methods and delicacy can only create what is a poorly thought out toy. I would buy another product OR be prepared for a rough time of building with your beloved kids.
4,Good Book on Mediocre Paper,"An excellent book that takes a unique approach to explaining the world of amateur astronomy. I use this book more as a reference than a door to beginning to understand the huge world of astronomy (Terence Dickinson in Nightwatch does that best). Has an excellent Equipment section (especially the filters area), great planetary info in the Solar System section, and very handy reference charts in the back of the book.For the price of this book, you'd expect paper quality to at least be equal to The Backyard Astronomer's Guide (Dickinson, Dyer)-- but it isn't. The paper is cheap and really doesn't stand up well to the heavy page turning I have subjected it to - a minor gripe though. There is stuff in this book that is very hard to find elsewhere. Check it out in your local bookstore -- then buy it here at Amazon for a substantial discount off retail if you like it!"
4,Philip's tooth-cutting,Funny little story about a society completely obsessed with morality. Every bit as relevant today as when Philip K. Dick wrote it in 1956.
1,"Uri Caine, the Ultimate Musical Blasphemer","I was quite pleased when a friend gave me what I thought to be Mahler CD. Until I listened to it, that is.I could not fathom why the instruments were so horribly out of tune, sliding and screeching their way around the notes and rhythms. I was aghast, then hysterical with laughter. I kept the CD to play for friends, who were either too pained or nauseated to listen. Some joined in my derisive laughter, asking to hear it again and again, as one would repeatedly watch his favorite episode of the Three Stooges.Mahler's 5th Symphony and ""Kindertotenlieder"" are very dear to me, having performed these works. ""Kindertotenlieder"" are a study in expressivity of the depths of grief. Caine has made a silly, stupid mockery of these profound works. Equally ridiculous, the packaging and liner notes of the CD insinuate that of a classical work. Again, the pretension is absurd and laughable."
1,Uri Caine's mutiny against Mahler,"I've been a big Mahler fan since Bernstein's first recording (4th Symphony) as well as a knowledgeable follower of jazz. These pieces are grotesque caricatures of Mahler melodies and while I have not heard Caine's other depredations, after listening to this one I think I'll pass. If this is something released after a jam session that somehow was rescued from the cutting room floor, my apologies. But Mahler's melodies do not belong in a setting like this and who is Caine to try to improve on Mahler's orchestrations? Save your money."
5,From Yddish to Arabic Music towards Mahler,"Sensationally cultivated and sensitive arrangement of several musical roots and sounds, starting from Mahlers music."
4,Great Floor Puzzle,"My little 3 year old just loves this floor puzzle and loves the big chunky pieces! When she is done putting it together so quickly, she likes to stand up and look at the farm and walk across it. She just beams with pride at her accomplishment!"
3,difficult to read,Interesting storyline but difficult with a little too much to digest. I keep waiting for her to get to the point...better reading for classrooms.
5,"Information-packed and still, concise.","This is a book which explores the goddess myth from its paleolithic beginnings to the current time, and it is both a good read in the sense of possessing clarity of intent and good structure, and also in being consistently interesting. There is more history, scholarship, depth, and intellegence in this work than one might expect, and it is a good reference for those interested in history, in myth, and those who simply wish to understand the feminine aspect of divinity."
5,A really terrific resource on the history of Goddess culture,"I am a United Church of Christ minister. I am using this book for a book study with some women who wanted to explore the Goddess culture. We have been very impressed with both the scholarship of the authors, and their ability to creatively relate some of the myths to later biblical material. We have had many ""ah ha"" moments as we suddenly saw a correlation with stories and images we were familiar with in the Bible. I find this very enlightening and enriching for my ministry! And I have learned a great deal about a culture I had only known bits and pieces of before. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"
5,Jungian View of Myth,"When I finished this book I was very saddened because this is the book I wished I had had the ability to write. The authors have presented a detailed, fascinating book about a basic piece of what the Jungians would refer to as our collective unconscious. It's a wonderful book, clear, focused, well-illustrated, and guaranteed to give the reader lots of opportunities to say ""Aha, is that what that means?"""
2,Great at first -- then it doesn't stay in place...,"I loved the way this worked at first... I was able to see everything much more clearly. Then, after 6 months of use, the magnifier screen wouldn't stay up because it loosened up. I couldn't find any way to tighten it either. Too bad... I found a different brand that works and actually doesn't have a frame."
4,GBA SP Magnifier,I bought a SP magnifier and I really enjoy using it on my GBA. I have problems with my vision-so the magnifier is perfect. I also like the fact that once folded up-it folds right into the GBA SP.
4,Great!!,My kid loves it! I can even tell that the letters can be easilt read and that she doesn't get as many headaches when she uses it.
3,good but ok,"Good helps but not perfect nor necessarily needed !!!! Also doesnt stay perfectly in place but pretty good and semi useful but you can play with out it fine and see your GBA SP well enuff w/o it if needed !!!! Buy if you needed it , some what recommeneded if needed but ok ;> !!!"
2,poor durability,"It does magnify and it's great that it folds flat to the GBA, but both of ours broke within the first year. The screws loosen and, no matter what we tried, they would not stay tightened. One magnifier lost its' screws and the plastic broke on the other. Unfortunately, I'm on-line looking for a better alternative."
3,Mixed feelings,"The author sets up an opening system for you that may or may not fit our style - as typical of most books that select a system for you. However, the book will provide you with a fair number of good ideas for a player who already has developed their opening system.Some of the lines are not the strongest, and often obvious questions come up about alternate moves that seem like reasonable continuations. Explaining on what is going on is lacking for the lower rated player. Therefore, this book is recommended for players between perhaps about 1400 and 2000."
3,"Lot of information, very hard to use as reference","I was amazed to discover that the book has no index, no key for opening moves etc. You either have to know his name for the openings and variations, perhaps generally known but not by me, hunt page by page for the proper line. Good if you want to follow his lines - the implied objective of the book, but horrible for a reference.It is very difficult to locate a line given opening set. No index is amazing in today's publishing!"
1,Forget it,"This book is really very bogus. I am not sure where this analysis comes from but it does not hold up.Let's take one example page 297, has a variation of the Italian game. It is game 7. The note for move 12 says that white can not stand to play a3 because of ... Ba6. Well, the delorie computer webpage basically disproves that quite simply. The basic point is that black has a bishop that is hanging. He has no time to play either ...c5 or ...Ba6. After ...Bxd2 13. Qxd2 Ba6 black does not seem to have a way to get at the ""stuck"" king. Since white simply plays Qc2 and Ng5 is aways a threat. This whole line seems to be predicated on some wild dream. The book is full of this kind of blathering and not worth the money."
3,Need for more work.,"Read the book a few times but couldn't make myself to buy. Thanks to the reviews of recent reviewers, the book doesn't have the list of openings and index??? It loses at least 1/3 of the value for this factor, the book must save the reader time to look for info. The presentation of the games are OK, but the theme arangement is not very clear. I would get a used one for 1/3 to 1/2 of the listed price, but no more."
3,Its okay,"Liked her other books better,more detailed,can make out what you are making ,like it looks more like the thing you are making ,not what is that that i am making."
3,Interesting but poorly written and edited. . .,"I'm a fan of true crime and although this is a very gruesome case, I found it interesting to follow. . .but it was very poorly written and edited, reads more like a first draft. The inserted legal explanations--which interrupted the narrative--drove me nuts (most people who read these books are familiar with the terminology; if an author feels a need to insert the info, put a glossary in the back). This book could have been written so much better and it was irritating to shuffle through the choppy, repetitive sentences and poor grammar. I also wish the author had taken the time to research the two criminals' backgrounds more, to include--as Ann Rule does. That would have made the book so much better."
3,Music is good,"Music was good....quality of the CD was poor. Low volume and not much bass. Every time the CD comes up, I have to readjust the stereo."
4,Fun for Kids,"I ordered these items for my Saturday school's outdoor activity. Previously, I did not think that they are made from plastic sack, but it is ok anyway. They are strong enough. I receive the packet in a good condition, but they have two double color: green (one sack has upside down printed number). This sack is good for kids (not too tall kids)"
3,Not my favorite,"I admit I am not a sophisticated consumer of classical music, but I have other albums featuring viol, so my reaction is not because the instrument is new to me.That said, my only comment is that the voicing of the instruments seemed to blend in to one another, and from note to note on a single instrument, so that some of the pieces ended up sounded ""muddy"" to my ears."
5,"Wonderful interpretation, brilliant sonics.","Fretwork is always good, and here they truly exceed expectations. The recording quality is wonderful. Highest recommendations."
4,Bach: The Art of Fugue,"Bach: The Art of Fugue is a recording that does not use the traditional organ or harpsichord but here one has useed string instruments. The end resulst is not nearly as strange as one would imagine. Harmonia Mundi has done a good job with the booklet and we get well written linernotes by Mr David Pinto. The booklet itself is 27 pages long and we get the linernotes in English, French and German including a short introduction of the Fretwork group. The front cover I do not care all that much about and looks like the photograph was shot by a child and not a proffesional. The inside photo of the group is fair enough but some of them could have had a bit of help when it comes to what they decided to wear. Even so this is a very nice recording that adds a different twist to a beloved classic. 4/5."
5,Kuryakyn Shift Lever Peg,This peg fits perfectly my Honda Shadow Aero 2012. They are of excellent quality and beautiful look. I took less then 10 minutes to fit. Note:you might sacrifice the original rubber insert on the peg as it is a must to remove it to install the new peg cover and it is very difficult to remove.
4,Classic!,"This is one of those old fashioned books written in a pre-electronic age. Though the book was written for audience of a century ago, the book is very readable to this day. The translation of the book from the original Russian version is flawless and captures the early twentieth-century sense of excitement about physics. The book contains many anecdotes taken from history, for instance the author narrates the story of Chelyuskin disaster to illustrate the principle of Bernoulli's principle. This book makes for an interesting reading and can be read at leisure without a break in flow over the weekend afternoons."
2,A disappointment,"Cold war thrillers are one of my guilty pleasures and I was expecting a little-known gem after reading the other reviews. But this book was somewhat of a disappointment.The dialogue seems forced and even stilted. For example, several Americans are asked to join a trip. After one accepts, another says, ""I, also, of course."" Now, have you ever heard an American say ""I, also"" instead of ""me, too""?The lead female character is also a problem. Almost none of her actions or dialogue rang true for me. She seemed liked nothing more than a clumsy device to move the plot along. If the plot required a tantrum, she threw a tantrum. What's worse, for a thriller, this book wasn't very, well, thrilling. The first half of the book seemed to drag, although it did pick up in the second half.SEMI-SPOILER ALERT: I also disliked the ending, or should I say, the non-ending. When you stick with an author (or in this case, authors) for 307 pages, you deserve some sort of payoff."
3,This is not the universal rack!,"I bought this rack, and I could have sworn that it said universal rack, but it did not fit on my factory installed rack. I later came to find that it is the 91725 rack that is universal, NOT the 725. I had to buy the adapters, and the rack seems to be working well, but it cost me an extra $30 for the additional parts. Make sure you check the part number and order the 91725 if you want the universal mount. If this rack does fit your car, it is very easy to install."
2,"Works, but a little off...","It does work well with maybe two set of skis... But it sure can't fit four pairs of skis or 2 boards... lol! No way! And good luck using a factory rack; I have a Toyota '08 Forerunner Limited, and it DOESN'T fit! Good luck with the Yakima rack system, piece of junk. The bars on that system and the Thule carrier is made to go on square bars... figures... Though I learned that with the Kayak system too, so whatever...In the end, it has to go on a Thule Rack System."
5,Thule has discountinued this item try the part #92725,I originaly purchased the 91725 for my car and love it. When I went to purchase one for my daughters car I found that Thule has discountinued this item and now has a part # 92725. It wider and fits better..... Try it out.
1,"""Universal Mount"" isn't","The literature describes this unit as a flat-mount ski rack compatible with any factory-installed roof rack with crossbars. Hardly.My vehicle is a 2006 GMC Envoy with a factory roof rack. This rack is the same one used on many GM SUVs, so great numbers of them are out there. These racks have crossbars with a ""reverse wing"" shape that are tilted forward, presumably to reduce wind noise. The Thule ""universal"" mounting system will not conform to these crossbars, and will only mount with the ski rack tilting forward (or backward) at a silly angle. It can be used in this conformation, but it looks odd.Also, the ski rack indeed locks over the skis/boards, but the mounts are not lock-protected, so the entire ski rack and contents can be easily stolen with standard wrenches.My searches found no alternative to this rack, however, and it does work for the intended purpose."
2,Sorry but it's very boring,"This is not one of Berger's best: in fact it's not far short of the worst thing he's ever written. Almost entirely without humour, this is a dull dog of a book. Only the seriously committed need bother: others perhaps should look to his '60s masterpiece 'A Fortunate Man' or the later 'Into Their Labours' trilogy. But please steer clear of this one."
1,Very Dissapointed,"Though the tracks on this CD are fine, I was not happy with the product. Each track has a 2-second delay in between... so the music does not seque into each other. Not at all what I was expecting."
1,Unwatchable,"Wretched quality and the films are not even complete. Max Takes a Bath is missing the entire set-up with the doctor. I will never buy another Grapevine Video release; I've tried them four times now, and their quality is ALWAYS the lowest of the low. I would rate this ZERO stars if I could. Instead of buying this, go for ""Laugh with Max Linder"" which is excellent."
4,Eyewitness to Civil War times,"This is a book I had a hard time putting down. It is an eyewitness account of civilian Civil War times, and is a ""must"" for Civil War period buffs. It tends to deromanticize the era, as Libbie Custer tells the day-by-day details of marching with the Union Army, living in then near-desolate Washington D.C., and taking over rooms in Confederate farmhouses to set up camp. But those details are nevertheless fascinating, because they are so different from life today. Her memoirs unfortunately give too little information about Custer's personality and her relationship with him, which I was eager to learn. This is probably due to the writing style of the era, however, as Victorians tended to be ""closed"" about their personal feelings."
3,Not on the same level as Here Come the Warm Jets....,or Another Green World (or even Before and After Science) but still a good cd in the Eno catalog that has actual vocals.
4,good but a little odd,"this is a good cd and it and the rest of eno's cds have inspired much other crap which does not even compare with this. But i do think it is alot bit odd and the songs can get a little repetitive at times. But the songs r good so it makes up for the fact that thier repetitive. This is an inavative cd that has some great stuff on it, but i just find it a bit strange."
3,The Least Satisfying,"of his remasters from the early to mid seventies, this is essentially Roxy Music without Ferry. Or at least a Manzanera and Eno project. In any case nowhere near the dynamic that infuses anything with the Fripp & Eno moniker. Most of the CD sounds like Eno is still trying to establish just what his identity is. There aren't any melodies to speak of, but the experiments are courageous, and better stuff was coming. I'd recommend this for the completist only."
5,It's about time!!!,"Carl has always played with an effortless fluent sound. Ideas seem to flow endlessly and accurately. This is my newest favorite album. Everyone I have played the album for is amazed at his agility and flexibility. What they don't know is that Carl has been playing this way for more than thirty years. His knowlege of changes and ability to get around the horn has always been phenominal and he has improved with age. ""Minute Waltz"" is a great feat to pull off and he does it with such ease as to make your head spin. The personnel on the album is outstanding. It's good to hear Roger and Santo together, and Buster is as solid as any bassist around."
5,"Simply , Fantastic!!","I have been playing trumpet for 60 years and listening to good music (pop and classical) for almost that long. In those years a number of fine trumpet players have surfaced who stand head and shoulders above the rest (Bud Herseth with the CSO and Maynard). I put Carl Saunders among the best. He is doing things that don't seem possible, either technically and musically, on trumpet. Because I have never been prolific at ""improv"" (that's an understatement) I marvel at those who make an art of this playing technique. But Saunders seems to go beyond the normal technique. Ideas come so fast that he can't keep up with them. Enough can't be said about this fabulous performer. Everybody should listen to his technical facility and musicality, everybody!"
1,Not a good buy,"What a disappointment. All this product was, was a can with a huge light-bulb and a mirror inside. The lens was a tubular gadget with a glass inside it that you manually move back and forth. I wanted a bigger image on the wall, what i got for a clear image was a 4x7 image. Any bigger you got a blurred image. My kid could build this for ten bucks."
4,"Brick, Crystal Metallic glasses",I purchased these glasses in Feb 2011 for riding my Harley. Great glasses they really keep the wind and dust out of your eyes while riding with an open face helmet.I consider these glasses a very good buy. Well at least for myself.
2,Cute... when it works,"I've had this cd player for a few months and my daughter uses it to listen to her music on the 20 minute drive to and from school every day. It absolutely CHEWS through batteries, even running for only 40 minutes a day... I have to swap out the batteries every couple weeks. In addition, the cd player has been getting stuck a lot recently... skipping and freezing up in the middle of songs that play with no problem on the car cd player.Overall, not worth the money."
4,crayola cd player,I bought this for my 4 yr old daughter for her first cd player. It works well and she is able to manage it herself. We have not tried changing the color discs.
4,A good survey,"If the book weren't so dated, it would be a better survey of the field. Sampson does a good job outlining the historical development of linguistics as a discipline and the main schools of thought currently existing; it's a must-read for those who enjoy the field. But there are a couple of needlessly eurocentric comments, and while I agree with the author's attacks on generative grammar, they are probably a bit harsher than deserved (though at the time of publication, as Sampson is keen to point out-- and exaggerate-- the generative school had an enormous unfair advantage in terms of media publicity and the ability to dominate professional linguistics journals)."
2,It was a difficult read...,"This book was disjointed. It was really hard to follow what was going on and where the author was going and why. The book seemed to be a compilation of miscellaneous stories about his life. Some of the stories made sense, while others were out of place and unintelligible. This made for a difficult read."
5,MSR what did you expect?,"I needed a water bladder but I could use the plan I'm at site. This was perfect for me, I love the build quality of this product and I'm sure it will last for years to come."
2,Not up to par.,"Irish Whiskey, the third of Andrew Greeley's Nuala Anne McGrail mysteries is not as successful as its predecessors. The mystery deals with the mysterious death of an Irish bootlegger, Jimmy ""Sweet Rolls"" Sullivan and once again Nuala has the feeling something is not quite right with the story. But the mystery plays second fiddle to two sub-plots; the upcoming wedding of Nuala and her stalwart Watson, Dermot, and a case against Dermot concerning how he achieved the financial independence he has. The former is a problem due to the machinations of Nuala's oldest brother; the latter is caused by a vindictive figure from Dermot's past. Both these storylines take away from the original mystery, which plays second fiddle to these soap opera plot lines. While Greeley continues to make Nuala and Dermot enjoyable and believable characters this was a disappointing sequel."
5,always loved this book,i used to read sweet valley all the time from the school library and i read all of them. i dont care for the newer ones that are out now.
4,A must read for Romantics.,"This book, in my opinon, is one of the best Sweet Valley books ever! It's romantic, tragic and historic. It covers every thing from the French Revloution to the 60's era. I was so enchanted with it that I couldn't stop reading it. Personally, my favourite of all 5 stories is the second one. The one starring Celeste and Marc. It was so romantic but it wasn't over done either. I think that all hopeless Romantics would enjoy this book a lot."
3,"Ok, not as good as the Wakefield Sagas","A lot of people seemed to have enjoyed this book, but I have to say that I only thought it was ok. I liked the Wakefield ones the best; the Patman one was pretty good, too. I think the problem with this one for me was that this time they actually knew that they were meant to be. Usually it's 2 generations before the two families meet again...this one they knew about it because the generations where the families meet are separated. As well, in the other books there was certain something special on each side of the family that signified their love. There were only roses for this one...and only on one side of the family. Overall, it was ok, but I didn't enjoy the romances as much as the other sagas...they didn't seem to have the same feeling."
3,A slice of history and damaging medical myth.,"I'm not sure how to rate this book, as it is a historical slice of fiction, mostly, and has to be valued as such. It is a book that can show you how circumcision became popular in America as an anti-""self abuse"" operation. Or where the perfect Christian model of sexual fear and frustration began. If you want to know how NOT to raise your child, and more perfectly understand the faulty model that many Americans were brought up on, this is the book to read. Freud had a happy business no doubt partly because of this book."
5,A Must For Anime Lovers!!,"Anime Lovers, Rejoice!!! Finally there's a anime series you can watch with you significant other, or even teens without the embarrassing nudity, sexual situations, strong violence or excessive profanity. It's Dai-Guard!This is one of the few anime series I could actually immerse myself in. The characters are true-to-life complete with emotion. The situations seem almost realistic, and the comedy isn't really ""cartoony"". This is one of the best, under-rated and under-appreciated anime series out there. Please give this one a try...it will not disappoint and you can share it with the family."
5,"Not the ""Insight"" series from Paulist","In the 60s and 70s, a religiously oriented production company, called Paulist productions, produced a number of episodes of a series called ""Insight"". They were uplifting stories that gave *insight* into the human condition. An arm of Paulist still gives out the Humanitas awards for media that fulfills that mission.These videos are NOT FROM THAT SERIES. They're a different series about teaching the blind."
2,Box not suitable for the set,"Like the set, but do not like the way the box is designed. This is definitely not the same quality as the Erector set I grew up with, but at the very least, make a box that holds the pieces without losing them in the box - once you open the bags."
3,Erector 30 Model Set 352 Piece Set,Erector 30 Model Set 352 Piece Set son can't get the battery pack to stay together. screws keep coming out
5,"Good price, good quality, good shipping, good buy.",This heater control unit fit perfect. Quality appears good and it operates like it was supposed to. I had the unit on time and it was packaged well. Good price for this product.
2,tiny trinket box,After I recieved this as a gift I was really disappointed. It is so small. Really not worth the price someone paid for it. I would pay $5.00 at the most for it.
1,This is well written but depressing and not really SF,"I enjoyed the first few pages and thought I was going get a fascinating story about a world taken over by alien plants and the people resisting the invasion. WRONG. When they started murdering people by the dozen and grinding them into sausage I knew I had the wrong book. If you enjoy stories about about mass murder, torture, cannibalism and the hopelessness of life, then this will be your meat (so to speak). If, you, however, enjoy a story about decent people rising to meet challenges, then trySisters of GlassorAraminta Station (Cadwal Chronicles, Book No. 1)."
2,An incitement to prejudice that's well presented,"A very disappointing book for me. The presentation is great but content is poor on two levels: unacceptable sweeping generalisations (eg. brown eyed people are intellectual)and a negative approach to the subject matter: systematically critical and judgemental about people and not seeing their strengths. What a contrast with books like The Power of face Reading by Rose Rosetree, or Face Reading: an Illustrated Encyclopedia by Mac Fulfer, whose respect and compassion for the human race calls out from every page. Also, the interpretations given in this book differ often from those given by other respected experts. Conclusion: not a book I shall be able to use, nor would I give it to anyone."
5,Congratulations!,I have found this book to be a life saver in the business world. I am no longer in the dark with people and have increased my success with clients and customers dramatically. I feel like I've gained some kind of new magic power. Thanks again for one of the most intriguing and life changing reads.
1,Don't wast you're money,"The only reason this book has a 4+ star ranking is all the puffing up by ""A Customer"" who probably is the writer. The only kind things I would have to say about the book have already been said in reviews by Patricia Lamin or sumo."
5,Gameboy Advance SPMagnifier,"The gameboy magnifier is great, I can see everything a little bigger and clearer. It folds up easily for storage. I haven't taken it off my gameboy since I took it out of the package. I highly reccomend it! Anna"
1,Do not buy,"Hard to turn on (factory defect according to seller after he sold it)not accepting an sd card, no sound on movie review"
5,A Christian-minister-to-be finds it FANTASTIC!!!! - J.Vargas,This is a great CD for people really interested in India's religous music. This is not a spotlight for Shankar's sitar virtuosity. This is only meditative music for the spirit and soul.
5,Chants Of India: Ravi Shankar,"This is one of my most cherished disks. I find the Sanskrit mantras rendered in Ravi Shankar's compositions, as well as the traditional Vedic chanting heard on this disk, definitive and powerfully moving. Additonally, the modern-style love song to God, ""Prabhujee"", features beautiful words and melody over George Harrison's acoustic guitar chording, evoking deep feeling, longing for the Divine.When I bought this disk years ago, it came with a booklet featuring extensive liner notes, including the Sanskrit portions written in the Devanagari script, with transliterations and translations by Panditjee himself. This disk has thereby proven itself a great resource in my studies of Sanskrit, enabling me to read - and therefore properly pronounce - these important verses. I hope this information is still provided in the disk, as a version I bought in India omitted these extensive texts."
5,Boundless Joy and Serenity,"A string of pearls for peace and harmony. It elevates the basic principles of the religion. To enjoy this CD to the maximum, I recommend people to initially read through as they listen, the enclosed booklet which is printed in Sanskrit, English and with the meaning of each serene rhymes, slokas and hymns and the next time.... sing along with it - you will feel the difference in your inner self : Tranquility. It is a marvelous work by Shankar and Harrison."
5,OMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM Namo namaha,"Ommmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm namo guru dev namaha - awesome album. Transporting, uplifting, hypnotising, powerful and unique. Ravi and his wife, Sukanya (produced by George Harrison) have given a real treat with this album. If you haven't ever heard mystical Indian music, this is a great place to start. If you're not hooked after this you'll never be!!!"
5,Excellent for relaxation,"First of all I like to appologise to review a great meastro like Pt Ravi Shankar. But I like to put forward only one thing- Normally there are some ragas which are slow in nature and many people may not like, but this one is not so. One should listen to this piece in solitude and enjoy the background music with the recitations of the Slokas. Voices for thr recitations has been well selected."
2,Disappointing: sentimental folk music,In this CD you will not find any of the mystical atmosphere of Indian music. The voices are quite ordinary and the tunes have a disgusting sentimental flavour. Some of the voices are so nasal that they are really unpleasant to listen to.I wonder why the name of Ravi Shankar is so prominent on this CD because you hardly hear the sound of the sitar.
2,this cd is for ex-hippy newagers.,"This cd was the first cd in the genre of subcontinental indian music i ever got, as a deal from bmg music club. i got the cd for two dollars, and i still don't think it was a terribly good buy. Fortunately, i have many friends who are from india or have lived there part of their lives who showed me real indian music, not this mushy stuff, with its elements of western music. mixing indian music and western music is a bad idea. get some traditional indian music, whether you want to hear good indian music, or just trip out on shrooms. get some zakir hussein or something."
1,I am disappointed,"Being a Sanskrit scholar (Ph.D.in Sanskrit, Samaveda) and sitar player, disciple of Pt. Ravishankar since 1963, I am quite disappointed to listen to these compositions. No ancient heritage impact of Mantras was found in the above compositions. I am deeply hurt, beacause Guruji (Pt. Ravishankar) is a legendary composer, and I love many of his compositions since my childhood. But this album has not touched that level. I felt the prayer from his album 'Passages' with Phillip Glass, is far better than these verses. Chandrakant (Chandu)"
3,Student cookware,"First of all, this set is NOT the made-in-USA All-Clad, which is made in Pennsylvania in a special factory with special materials, but is made in China for All-Clad. The pieces are small, with no lids, and no lids are available. This is a freebie that comes if you buy a set of ""the other"" All-Clad. Probably an experiment to see if China can do as well as the USA.That said, the pieces are smaller than the usual smallest All-Clad pieces. Remembering that you can never fill a cooking pan brimful, you should count on a capacity of only a few cups in these ""helpers."" They are just about right for heating up a small portion of something if you live in student digs."
5,Wow - I never had cookware that performs this well!,I just recently received this set as a gift from my wife. I'd been talking about updating some of the accessories in our kitchen and cookware was one of the things I couldn't decide on. We've had Farberware for 20 years and been mostly satisfied with its performance - but I really wanted something a little more sturdy. So when these showed up I was excited to try them out. My experience so far leads me to believe that these things will last forever if you take care of them. I find that they fit the way I cook and are really easy to clean - if you follow the directions. I couldn't be more impressed.
5,sparkley,this was the prefect addition to my star reader bulletin board......I love the size and the sparkles. Very cute and bright
5,Definitive Album,I bought this CD at Media Play back in the day. It introduced me to LTJ Bukem and MC Conrad and I have been loving them ever since. They put out great compilations over the years but this one carved a special place in my heart.
2,All Sounds the Same,"Every song on this 2 CD compilation sounds the same; it's an ok song, but do you really want to hear it for 1 & 1/2 hours?"
1,What an unpleasant surprise.,"My daughter and I expected these to be roughly the size of the Stacy dolls in the old Barbie line, and were very surprised when we saw how large they actually are. They might have been a bit more playable if there was at least some articulation, but their legs don't even bend. They are really figures more than dolls.Two thumbs down!"
3,Surprised by Size,"My daughters were surprised by the larger size of the new Stacie doll and her friends. My oldest daughter who is 8 was expecting to be able to add these dolls to her existing collection of Barbies, friends, etc. She was pretty upset about the change. My younger daughter who is 3 didn't really mind. Please make a point to let customers know about the size difference for this new style of doll."
4,Rodney O & Joe Cooley puts out a gen,"In F..ck New York the trio put out its best work since Me and Joe. The concept of the cd was ahead of its time and should stand as a classic underground release. The alblum is full of tracks to ride to and bob your head. Also, on this particular cd, Rodney O probably did his best work with the pen."
4,underated g funk,"love how these 2 came at new york with the parliament-zapp samples from flashlight, and more bounce letting you know this is west coast at this time the east-west beef was going too bad they did;nt say names the rest of the aklbum isn't bad either."
5,Cd-Review,"I am positive that this cd and any cd from this artist is worth purchasing. If you haven't heard this artist before, strap yourself down and take a deep breath !"
5,You know when I'm with you I can really be myself...,"This is the original punk funk. David Brown and the late Black Randy brought this version of the Metrosquad around in '79 or so. The price of the cd is worth the liner notes alone. David Brown was pretty much the catalyst of this whole scene along with Pat Rand, who had good day jobs...they brought us many other bands via Dangerhouse Records.Black Randy is dead and he was cool. He was a lyrical genius with a drunk automatic writing style. Remember the Green Frog!!!This was a great bunch of guys and a fun scene. Sad that it's gone."
5,"why yes, this IS punk funk!","woo hoo! Black Randy and the Metrosquad is the greatest thing ever! They have songs like, ""Say it Loud (I'm Black and I'm Proud!)"" where they name-drop Dee Dee Ramone. They do the theme from Shaft. It's super-weird and great. Idi Amin, their song about the about the ruthless dictator, is the greatest: Idi Amin, I am your fan...next time you're in town we'll go to CBGB!anyway, if you like weird and obscure punk rock, this is for you."
3,It's good but not great,"Black Randy is the kind of musician who makes a career out of being sick and twisted and having little actual musical talent. He's a little like G.G. Allin but not quite so sick. This album is very basic punk rock with a little bit of synth thrown in. It's kind of funny. The high point is ""Idi Amin"", written about my very favorite Ugandan cannibalistic dictator. Dissect that sentence and you'll figure out what this album is like."
2,not too clear,"This is basically a thin piece of fabric with pinked edges. When ordering it was not particularly clear what exactly this would be like and for the price I took the chance it might be good. I like the size for doing larger pieces, but it is not particularly see through and works no better than a piece of scrap muslin or any other cotton fabric."
3,I second that this would have made a better magazine article than a book,"Yes, I realize that this a non-fiction STORY and not supposed to be a reference book filled with page after page of dry, boring facts, but this book could have been cut by about 33%. The author drones on and on needlessly about unimportant, irrelevant details.For example ""The mercury flirted with ninety, while anvils in the sky built, waiting to crack and wash away the fetid air."" Ummm... how about these 5 words instead: ""it was a hot day."" I know some of you are thinking that this is supposed to paint a picture, but trust me it isn't even necessary to mention the weather as it did nothing to advance the story/plot.Call me unimaginative but parts of the book read more like they belong in a 19th Century poem rather than a modern book. I agree with the other reviewer that this would have made a better magazine article or a much shorter book."
2,"Should have been a magazine article, not a book","The author is a journalist. It is clear that he accustomed to writing shorter essays and getting paid by the word. He spared no words or overstatements. This book is about a federal investigation of a coin wanted by collectors. I am a federal investigator and a coin collector. The first eighty pages of the book are a good read and a nice discussion of U.S. coins and the double eagle. The book then drones on and on discussing an unlikely series of circular interviews described with pointless details. The author attempts to tell the story in a colorful fashion by including passages that are reminiscent of detective novels but falling far short - to the point of being trite. Face it, this investigation lagged for 60 years. Obviously, evidence discovery was slow.If you are getting on an airplane and want a pleasant read that will put you to sleep, go ahead and buy it. The price is cheap."
1,Big disappointment,Wow! What went wrong? I bought this book because of all the positive reviews. That was a mistake. The book is just a mess - it is almost impossible to follow along with the story because so many different characters are introduced and so many facts recounted without any overarching themes or ways to keep track of the main story.
3,Competent but Tedious,"Although hard core coin collectors will enjoy this book, those of us who enjoy reading non-fiction crime stories will be a little disappointed. The author does a good job in describing the history of the coin at stake but loses something in the translation. The sad fact is that this coin's history is checkered and unknown. Therefore, the reader is always left guessing and speculating about how it ended up at auction. There is very little that is ""known"" when it comes to how this coin escaped the melt-down. Perhaps this is not the author's fault as he is limited by his subject. The book is readable and grabs the reader at times with the description of the auction as well as the FBI investigation in the 1930's as they tried to track down where the coins came from and who had them. All in all, the author did a competent job but the subject, which could have been fascinating, is somewhat dull."
5,Maltese Falcon Meets LOTR,"I expected Illegal Tender to be heavy on historical facts and otherwise a dry, boring read. What I got was something completely different. Tripp does an outstanding job of keeping dry subject matter exciting. Well, exciting if you enjoy numismatics + history. Highly recommend this book if you're looking for something different from the usual run of the mill crap out there on the shelves."
5,The Blues is just the starting point for this fine debut CD.,"BLUES FROM ANOTHER DELTA is a solid debut recording by Sacramento-based bluesman Ray ""Catfish"" Copeland and his band, The Crawdaddies. The name of the CD, ""Blues From Another Delta"" refers to the Sacramento River Delta, a meandering maze of waterways that is so similar to the Mississippi Delta (the birthplace of the blues) that it is often used by Hollywood as a stand in for the Big Muddy. Standout cuts include ""Jumpin' at the Jazz Jubilee"" a paean to the local Sacramento Jazz Jubilee, where Catfish holds court on an annual basis at the blues tent, ""I Wanna Bop"", a chugging rockabilly blues, and ""Gold Cadillac"", a witty ""wish-I-had-a"" type number. Although the band are categorized as a blues unit, healthy and welcome doses of African rhythms and blistering American Rock n Roll saturate this CD. Treat yourself, add this CD to your cart and in 2-3 days you'll be dancing to a different kind of delta. Yeah, buddy."
2,Appleworks 6.0,"We installed an upgrade to our Mac operating system and it would not handle the old appleworks which had all our information from years past. Unfortunately, our new system would not handle 6.0 so we were dead in the water. We have not retrieved the information we had in the old appleworks program. The short of it is, since the program did not load, we have not used it."
5,25 l Andrews Sisters treasures,"Just when you think all the Andrews Sisters recordings have been released, comes along this CD with long out of print songs with duets by Dan Dailey, Alfred Apaka, Red Foley, Dick Haymes, etc. Nicely packaged and the sound is great."
3,Missing parts of the story,This apperrs to be an abridged edition of the original Kline story. As a boy I read a version printed circa 1929 or the 1930s which contained far more development of the action. For example in the earlier version there is an episode of an encounter with a ptang which is killed and eaten by the rebels in Uxpo. That episode describes what a ptang is. in the modern version there is no mention of the hunt and the word ptang appears once with no description. The current version omits passages which carry the story smoothly through passage of time. The current version jumps from one adventure to another with no connection of the time or action between events. Is it possible to find an uncut version of Planet of peril?
3,Its ok but limited,"This is a good book for just starting out, but anyone who has played for a while (more than a year or so) may find this book limited. I was able to go thru all the lessons in a day and a half. At least the songs in here are different than most of the other lesson books."
5,Worth the purchase!!!,I picked up guitar a few years ago and have been struggling finding a good book that would allow me to teach myself at my own pace and at the same time leave me feeling like I was accomplishing something. This book shows really nice melodic chord changes that will have you feeling good about your playing almost immediately!!! I recommend it for any beginner-intermediate guitarist who is looking for a book to help them FEEL and HEAR the guitar in a new light!!!
4,Good book,"Targeted to a range from beginner - intermediate players. I really love the piece arrangement on this book. Shows simple yet produce a really good sound. You will definately have a fun time playing while learning through this book. Definately recommend this book to anyone, also look around for other Mark Hanson's books."
4,Another Hanson winner,"I like Hanson's books - he's a good teacher with good material, as are most other authors of tutorial books with CDs. However, I could've saved a lot of money on books had I first come across the DVD ""How to Play Fingerstyle Guitar"" by Eltjo Haselhoff (available through customerservice@peghead.nl), which I'd come upon at YouTube. The video production is top notch, from lighting to scripting, to camera angles, etc. and Mr. Haselhoff's goal is to get you to a point of fingerpicking mastery that you needn't have to have tab to play a tune that you've heard. His instructions are very clear, and, like his playing, precise. And he has a pleasing personality as well.Check it out."
4,Good for finger picking techniques,Im not a good guitarist but after going thru this book found that im able to follow the style and the CD was a great help. Mark H. did a good arrangement and this book serves for an intermediate guitarist.
5,Helpful to learn,This is my second Mark Hanson book and I recommend it. If you are trying to learn fingerstyle this book is a must have.
3,Good,"I know that this is an old book, and it was advertised as good, but it was really wasn't in ""good"" condition, the binding was intact, but the pages were written all over and there was minor damages in the page structure."
1,Disappointed,"I was excited to get this book, since I am a stay-at-home mother of three. I believe that it's important to take care of yourself and feel confident in your decision to be a mother. This book didn't really give much advice. It skimmed the surface with suggestions about dressing cute, exercising, taking time for yourself...things I've heard a thousand times before. I like to hear real life tips on how other mom's do these things and more. I thought the book was a rip-off with no real content. A much better book, if you stay at home with your kids is Happy Housewives by Darla Shine."
1,Hard to Follow,"What a waste of money! Take out all of the quotes and places to jot down your thoughts and you're left with maybe 10 pages worth of worthless suggestions. Really - I should take time for myself? Gee, I hadn't thought of that one before! (sense sarcasm) Her writing is very hard to follow and skips around. Not a good read!"
5,Great Mother's Day Gift,"This book is a really great opportunity to encourage the moms in your life to embrace who they are! Not only is it hilarious and lighthearted, but it's premise is all about women empowering themselves and maintaining a sense of self while still being a parent. It's on the top of my list this Mother's Day!"
4,MILFs,"More than a MILF guide this book The Hot Mom's Handbook Moms Have More Fun by Jessica Denay untangles the mysterious of getting back you mojo.A mom herself, Jessica Denay brings together other moms to share and give pointers on love, sex, and bringing that spark back.It also has some touching insight into the love and care that all moms have for their young. Reiterating the old maxim, ""God could not be everywhere, so that is why he created mothers.""Money raised from this book goes to help women in need, visit:[...]"
5,"No, Mr. Bond I expect you to Buy","As a long time James Bond collector, I am always looking for new items to add to my collection. This car is great, like many of the other Johnny Lighting cars it has real rubber tires and incredible detail for such a small car. It is a perfect way to start a collection or add to exsiting one. I currently had mine dispalyed next to my Goldfinger twin car pack of Bond's Aston Martin DB5 and the 1955 Chevy sedan used by Goldfinger's henchmen. Also the pacaging freating the famous laser table scene from the film is the licing on the cake for me in terms of stunning visuals. Bravo Johnny Lighting"
3,utilitarian ceiling lamp,This light ended up being smaller and a little cheaper looking than I hadthought from the photo. But it gives off fine light and is completely functional.
2,Downer.,"Lubricated Goat must have been in a downward spiral here. The songs are mostly mid-tempo and narcotic sounding (but not in a very interesting way). I love this band, but this album features none of the fun or craziness that you'd expect from this band. There are two standout tracks here: 'You Remain Anonymous"" starts the album off relatively strong, and of course ""20th Century Rake"" is a rocker... this being the only track to feature members of the previous line up with Renestair EJ and Martin Bland. The rest of the album drags...This is however, interesting to fans of the band. Because there isn't too much music available from this under-rated band, fans will certainly find something interesting about some of this work.Find these albums first: Lubricated Goat Plays the Devil's Music, Paddock of Love, Schadenfreude, and Psychedelicatessen, (and the two 7"" single they released in the early 90's)."
1,not filterless as advertised!,"Honeywell advertises this humidifier as filterless, which is what sucked me into buying it. It turns out the unit has a replaceable ""demineralization cartridge"" which cost $6 for a pack of two (not much less than the cost of filters for other humidifier models). I can't comment on the functioning of the unit, since I plan on returning it tomorrow. False advertising pisses me off."
2,"Worked intially, but. . .","I liked this humidifier when I first bought it. It worked great and it was quiet. It's still quiet but it's not producing any mist. Sometimes when I shake it it will start up again, but by the morning it's not working anymore and it leaks all over the floor. So after kicking several times tonight, I've decided that it's going in the trash."
4,Mine Works,"I guess I bought a good one. This thing works great, no leaks, no white dust, and very quiet.The de-mineralization filters are easy to find at Target, and are $5 for two filters.I like this product."
1,leaves a puddle on your floor,"As other reviewers have noted, this product is prone to leaking water. I bought my unit last winter, used it for several months without incident, then put it away. I recently starting using it again, and after two weeks, discovered a large puddle on the floor. The humidifier continues to leak, even after reseating the valve."
1,Icky brown buildup,"The unit worked for about one year, however, I had to clean the base literally every day, as there was an icky brown buildup. I thought algae was growing in the filter, so I removed it, but that didn't help the problem. I don't know if the icky brown stuff was algae or mineral buildup, but regardless, it grossed me out and created a lot of extra work. Not to mention that the blue ""on"" light was so bright that it actually interfered with our ability to sleep and we ended up covering it with duct tape so we could sleep. I would not recommend it at all."
1,I actually bought this twice!,"Save yourself a lot of trouble and DON'T BUY THIS ONE! The first time I bought it, it worked for about 2 weeks, then had decreased output due to the black paint flaking off of the nebulizer (the part that makes the mist). So I returned it and bought another one...this one worked off and on for about a week and then never worked right after that, despite my careful cleaning and disinfecting, just like the owners manual instructs. I use it in my baby's room (very small room) and, after the first week, couldn't get the humidity above 20%. It's just not dependable, which is a pain when she wakes up constantly throughout the night sniffing and fussing due to dry air! I just ordered the Vornado 2.8 gal cool mist humidifier...hopefully that will work much better!"
1,Doesn't Deliver on Promises,"Not only is there a filter for a product that claims to have none (putting aside whether it's needed in non-hard-water areas) but, more importantly, it fails to raise the total humidity to the multi-source recommended 40-45% level. In my office, with is exactly 1/2 the 350 square foot size that Honeywell claims the product can handle, the mister, going full blast, even over night, fails to deliver enough mist, even on the highest setting, to nudge the baseline 25% humidity level up even one percent notch. So, yeah, it looks pretty, but you know what they say about looks aren't everything. I guess I need either to replace this thing or get another mister that is maybe less decorative and more functionally effective."
3,White dust ! &*(@!,"I really like this humidifier until I discovered a layer of white dust over everything in the room! I don't think it hurts anything, just annoying. I replaced the filter, but the damn white dust still there. BTW, if your filter is old, the humidified just stops working. I have a pair of glasses on the desk and have to clean it every time I pick it up to read, even in just a couple of hours. Other than that, it works fine. Quiet and I kinda like the blue light. Replace my night light."
1,don't believe in filterless!!,"I bought 2 of these. Filterless sounded great until you read the instructions. You have to carefully clean with a vinegar solution. If you touch the ultrasonic baffle you could damage it. It is a real pain to maintain. I will go back to a filter model. Oh and also, it leaked all over my hardwood floors damaging them and now I have a water stain in the ceiling below. NEVER AGAIN!"
1,Gurgle Gurgle Gurgle,"I bought this product because it said on the box it was quiet. The white noise from the ultrasonic mister is fine. It is quite pleasant. What is disturbing is the ""GURGLE GURGLE GURGLE"" every 4 minutes from the water chamber. It is certainly not quiet and it wakes me up. If it was a consistent gurgle I suppose I could get used to it, but it is very annoying and loud. I guess air bubbles get released into the chamber like a water cooler. The design seems to amplify the sound out of the chamber like a trombone and it is always random and loud."
1,Dont waste your time and money,"It looked great and said filter less, but it requires some kind of demineralization filter and you need to change it very often, i have a very small bedroom (10x12), though i switch it on 4 hours before going to bed and close the room completely, still i feel the dryness in the air. and boy it leaks water all over the places from top when you are filling the tank, and from bottom when it is working, I am returning mine after one week of use.By the way, it is not manufactured by Honeywell, but by a company called KAZ and they are using the Honeywell logo. its kind of cheating."
1,Do not buy: Leaks,"I own two of these. They worked great for 3 months and now the both leak. I tried customer support once and told they ""had not heard of this problem"". Hopefully now that I have read the reviews on Amazon, I can convince them otherwise. Please do not buy this unit."
2,Does this burn anyone else's nose and throat?,"No one else has mentioned this. I have not had the leaking or other problems that others have had, although we have not had the unit that long. I have stopped using this unit because of the smell it emits. It is chemically and stings both my throat and nose. I find myself sneezing. I have never been allergic to a humidifier before, or much else actually. I was wondering if there was some paint or something that I am inhaling but this does not seem possible."
2,Cure for Leaking Humidifier,"Mine also developed leaks. The problems is inside, not outside. Remove rubber plugs and screws, take out plate with fan, than plate with heating unit, there are than 2 rubber gaskets, one clear one black going into the unit. Clean and coat them with silicon sealer and put it back together. 10 minute fix. Good Luck"
4,Works great and as advertised but . . .,"Overall I am really satisfied. I love the stream of mist coming out of the top. I give it only 4 stars because the box says no filters and it obviously needs one as stated in the other reviews. Call it a filter or a cartridge, it's still 6 bucks every couple of months."
1,Disappoited,The humidifier worked great for 2 weeks but now leaks all over the floor during operation. I would not recommend buying this product.
2,didn't last very long,worked only about 1.5 years and then leaked all over the floor. I couldn't find the hole in the reservoir so I had to throw it out. Not Happy
5,"Excellent work,,","its works really good , we having now almost three months its work perfectly,,i recommended this product."
5,Loved it!,"Pefect size for a bedroom, adjustable mist, easy to handle and fill, very quiet. Light is a little too bright, but other than that I loved it. No leaks ar any problems at all."
1,A Piece of Junk,Pay attention to all these bad reviews. Do you notice a common thread? Leaks? Stops working after a period of time? All true. I've gotten tired of bringing mine back to Home Depot again and again and again for an exchange. Don't buy this product.
2,Motor died,"It didn't leak, like others have reported, but the motor died on its second season. Basically, it ran like a champ last winter, but this winter, it started making a loud rattling/humming noise. A week after this started (the second week of the season), the motor died.Out to the curb it went. Note that it has a 5 year warranty, but you would have to pay postage, and the turnaround time would be a couple weeks. Given that I had a 20% Bed, Bath and Beyond coupon, the effort to get it repaired would not have been worth it."
1,leaks!,This humidifier (Honeywell Ultra Quiet Care cool mist HUT102M) LEAKS! All the water will drain out of tank while it is supposedly running. It worked for me for the first winter (though it's very awkward to fill) but the second winter all the water out would leak out. It damaged furniture. Terrible product. Would give it zero stars if that was an option!
5,Get this,"If you have gotten the Lumix, you need this adapter. I have taken pictures that are better than my $1000 SLR using this camera and this adapter. You can use any professional filters or teleconverters and make some great images. It is made very well and strong, and makes the Lumix very versitile and I believe is a must have."
3,Not the Best,"The below reviewer is wrong: They ney is much older than the ""Egyptian Times."" It is not an Egyptian instrument either; nor is it Arabic. It is 100% Persian as is the name ""ney."" It existed in Iran at least 3000 years BC. Anyway, Omoumi's style is a bit dry. You can hear him ""poofing"" his breath into the instrument as if there were hair stuck on his mouth. I know other artists who aviod that style of playing, and it is much more satisfying. And the zarbi pieces are not as fast as they ought to be. The sound quality of the CD is not exellent either."
3,Fall in love with me,"I'm a die-hard fan of Steve's work, I've got everything! And I really like this record, but, I must say that this is just for fans. Everyone else would get dissapointed. This record can't reach the hights of ""Unearthed"" and ""Remindlessness"" (his two best solo records by far), but, if you're into Kilbey's universe then you will like it with the time. It's great to listen to his voice in songs like ""Fall in love"", or ""Midnite in America""!So a must for Kilbey fans, forget it if you're not. And hey, that's great"
4,Excellent jazz but pass if your expecting a Jamaican sound,"This is a fine jazz albumn (thus the four stars) but I'm oddly disappointed. I guess I was expecting a much heavier Carribean sound. The players are all top notch but most tracks sound like what you would expect to hear in any American club. There is one song, Strawberry Mango that has a satisfying reggae sound and sounds like they are having a lot of fun playing. The rest of the cd is good but sounds more Chicago than Carribean."
1,The Principal Challange,"This book is a mountain of theory with virtually no examples of practical application. The non-specific nature of this book makes it pretty much useless. Example: ""To be effective leaders, principals must know about and have skills to address the tasks and roles of transformational and instructional leadership."" With no examples or specific information of exactly how they purpose one use that information. The entire book is made up of this kind of rhetoric that I doubt is useful to anybody except graduate school teachers who need books that sound intellectual."
1,Farm Puzzle isn't as great as it seems,"I got this puzzle for my baby as a Christmas gift. Within the first few days, the puzzle pieces started to warp. Now the pieces are in two or three separate layers and don't even fit the spaces. I don't have the information on the company I got it from except for the name or I'd be getting my money back or getting it replaced. Now my baby wants to bite on the wood pieces. Not good!"
5,Love the textures!,"Both of my children love this puzzle. I like the excellent quality. I have a 2 1/2 yr old boy and a 13 mo old girl. They have learned the animal sounds and love the textures of each peice. I have a friend who is blind and I got it for her granddaughter and it really helps her to interacte with her granddaughter, as many toys you have to see it to play with it. We really enjoy this puzzle and all of our products from Lights,Camera, Inrteraction."
2,B O R I N G,"ONCE YOU SLAP THE ANIMALS ON A FEW TIMES IT'S BORING. MY 20 mo old son already knows the names and animal sounds so beyond making up stories there isn't much to this...for the price there are better values out there...heck, make your own farm puzzle"
4,Pleased with the puzzle,"We have 2 of these puzzles and the pieces are not interchangeable. I have had one for over 3 years and have had no problem with the animal fuzz. The newer puzzle did have a few splinters, but that could be from any number of factors - shipping, handling, display...These are brightly colorful puzzles that my children have enjoyed. I never thought about the pieces being difficult to get out of their slots. (I admit that I turn the puzzle upside down to get the pieces out. I do it with our peg puzzles, too.)"
5,A super hit,"This was a super hit for my year old daughter - she still plays with it months later. The peices fit easly, they are light weight and she likes to ""pet"" them.The only negative point is that after repeatedly being put in her mouth some of the coloring on the edges has worn off - most likely ingested - its doesnt seem to bother her tho. :)"
5,My Daughter's Favorite Puzzle,My daughter received this puzzle as a gift when she was 18 months old and loved it immediately. She loved the fuzzy texture of the animals and I used it to teach her the four animals included in the puzzle. The pieces are large and easy to put where they belong. My daughter is now 2 1/2 years old and has moved onto more difficult puzzles but still loves to play with this one. I have given this to several friends for first birthday presents and the feedback has been much the same as my own experience. I highly recommend this puzzle for beginners.
3,The Fuzz is Off the Chick,"I thought this puzzle would be a perfect starter puzzle for my 18 month old, who can't yet figure out a more complicated 8 piece knob puzzle. As soon as I saw her play with it, however, I realized I'd made a mistake.The pieces are raised, but it's difficult for her to grab them and remove them from the board, so she ends up dumping the board over. When she tries to put the pieces back into place, they don't click in fully, so she doesn't recognize a successful placement as successful. And although I've only had the puzzle a couple of weeks, the fuzz is wearing off and I find little bits of animal lint all over the furniture when she's been trying to play with it. Worst of all, she finds this puzzle easy to ignore and plays with it only when I'm right there directing every move. Save your money for the Geometric Shapes Knob Puzzle, ASIN: B00004R8K3."
1,Be careful!!!!!!!,"I watch my one year old play with all of his toys and he put a piece from this puzzle in his mouth and an extremely sharp, pointed shard of the wood particle board came off in his mouth. Had I had my back turned we would have had a real emergency. I will continue to allow him to play with it, but only under strict supervision and nothing goes in his mouth!!!! Bad construction."
1,Very dangerous,"My one year old son was chewing on a piece of this puzzle and a very sharp, pointed one inch shard of wood splintered off into his mouth. Fortunately I always play with him and was able to grab it. Had I not been there we would have had a severe emergency. Do not buy this puzzle. The pieces are constructed of layered wood veneer and the edges are frayed and splintery (right out of the package). The Melissa and Doug large knob puzzles are solid wood and SO much safer."
1,This puzzle should be pulled off the shelves!,"Let me first say that I have several Melissa & Doug puzzles & love them. I bought this puzzle in a specialty store (for a lot more $$), & had a problem within DAYS. The fuzz was coming off in clumps, & several edges were very rough & splintered. I'm suprised my son didn't get hurt. I did call Melissa & Doug, & they replaced the puzzle for a different one. I think if more people call about problems with this puzzle, maybe they'll see that they have to change it. Stick with their peg puzzles."
3,GE 6.0 Phone,"1. Most phones have the ability to dial at least nine numbers by pressing a ""memory button"" and hitting an assigned number. This phone does not. You have to scroll through their ""Phone Book"" and select your number.2. If you are mounting it on a wall, the phone does not mate with a standard wall mounting plate. I had to modify the back of the phone in order to mount it to a wall."
2,Not Stainless Steel,"This phone is silver colored plastic, not stainless steel. The ad copy is deliberately misleading on this point, and adding the term ""finish"" does not correct the misimpression. Don't be fooled!GE - DECT 6.0 - Stainless Steel Finish"
3,handsets,"I purchased this phone from a competitor, and it is impossible to find the expandable handsets. Supposedly the system is expandable to 4, but you can't expand if you can't find."
1,Do not recommend purchasing from this vendor,"This purchase gave me the worst experience with Amazon. We had our kitchen renovated and waited for this wall mountable phone... Despite numerous emails, vendor did not bother to reply on delivery status... After over a month, they advised item not available... I will not do business with this vendor again, and will not recommend them either..."
2,Plastic Silver Phone,"Wall phones are more difficult to come by so when I found this one which looked really nice from the box I was excited to pick it up for around $50. I was disappointed at how cheap it felt but again.. i needed a wall phone and this was the best I could find at the time. It lasted a little over a year when on day the receiver just stopped working. Now.. searching for a phone again I see this one... well, not on your life. Not again. GE has made a bad phone and worse yet, they've mislabeled it here by calling it ""Stainless Steel Finish"". Well... you can't say that you weren't warned when you open this POS up only to find you've been had."
4,unique style phone,"i purchased this phone 2 days ago, as i like the style.buying this phone at walmart was alot cheaper than to buy online.so far all is working fine. good phone."
4,GE Phone,"Very stylish looking phone.Very sleek look goes well with stainless finishes in our kitchen area. Best feature, it hangs on the wall. I looked all over for a phone/answering machine that could be hung insted of taking up the limited space I have on my kitchen desk. The drawback of this phone is it is a little difficult to program. All features are programed from the handset and the menus on the phone are somewhat difficult to find and the directions are a bit confusing. Not the easiest phone/answering machine I have owned but I would recomend the product none the less."
3,Fine if you don't need an answering machine,"The sound quality is great, and it looks sleek. But the answering machine only works intermittently. If I had kept my receipt I would have returned it."
4,Great wall mounted phone,This phone looks great on our wall. We dont use it much so I dont really have much to say about it. The only thing is that I wish it had an adjustable ring volume because when the phone rings it is way too loud and needs to go down a bit. Other than that I recommend to anyone looking for a not so expensive nice looking phone to hang on their wall.
2,"Can you say ""trash""?","The trash is exactly where ours has ended up! We purchased this, along with 2 accessory handsets (using our AMEX rewards points) for our Series 27909 phone and NEITHER of them will sync with the base. We tried several times and ended up contacting GE about it, who told us to unplug everything (including batteries from the phones) for 30 minutes and then try again. When that didn't work, we were basically told, ""Oh well"", and no offer of repair of replacement was made. We were told to return it to AMEX, but it was outside the 30-day window for AMEX returns, so we are stuck with this and 2 handsets that don't work and GE doesn't give a damn. This is worthless to us without the additional handsets."
4,Stainless steel finish,"I've read other reviews about how difficult this phone is to set up, program and hang on the wall. Well, I'm here to tell you I love my new stainless steel finish phone. It was easy to set up, it was easy to program, and I had no trouble hanging on the wall. The only con to this phone is the ""chirping"" ringtone. But once your used to it, it's fine!! I love the way the phone looks in my kitchen, it matches my stainless steel appliances. I also love that you can hang your answering machine on the wall without it teetering or sticking out so far. L O V E IT !!!!!!"
5,GE-DECT 6.0 Stainless,Phone does everything it was advertised to do. It easily mounted to the wall and the included DSL filter is a nice touch. Sound is crisp and clear. The red LED showing the number of messages will wash out in bright sunlight. The range of the unit is more than acceptable and there is no interference from or to the numberous other wireless devices in the home.
2,wall phone dilema,"I was not aware that I could have purchased this phone locally. If I had purchased it locally I probably would have returned it. It has a nice look to it and it does have a bright caller Id display, but the receiver sound is very ""tinny"" sounding. The buttons on the handset are flat and therefore you must press very hard on the keys. The sound from the built in answering machine works well it has a number of calls counter. The reason we purchased this phone was because our original wall phone quit working an we wanted a traditional look in the kitchen.I would only recommend this phone if you could overlook the poor receiver sound."
2,Looks good but problems from day 1,I love the way that this phone looks but I had to go through the hassle or returning due to manufacturer problem with answering machine not working. Amazon handled well but the quality of phone was disappointing. If you get a good one the looks are well done!
2,ge phone,Vendor service was good. The GE product is not of the quality I expected. Hard to set up and use.
3,Stainless Steel-Look Phone,"The phone works fine but was not as easy to set up as others I've had.It's not as solid as others, somewhat flimsy to handle."
4,as discribed,The sound is not as clear as I had hoped but is still satisfactory. It is very compact and looks good. It is not staonless steel but is plastic with a stainless looking finish. Installed very easy as it fit my wall plate perfectly.
5,This was made for the kitchen!,"The product was relatively easy to program, very user friendly to retrieve and delete messages and looks great in the kitchen."
1,Don't waste your money.,"Makes a nice kitchen clock, vloume on high still hard to hear,when hanging up ,does not disconnect,must press one of the buttons,which one??? It's a geat speacker phone. O'YA It's silver plastic."
4,Stainless look phone,"Got the phone set up and installed last week. Hey, it's a basic phone which is all we need. As others said, it's hard to find a wall phone anymore and the fact that it blends with our other stainless is great. Yes, the instruction sheet format is goofy, but that is no reason not to choose this phone. They are easy enough to understand."
1,never buy again,"The letters on the keypad too small, I need a magnifing glass. The instructions very difficult to understand and make work. Can not space or use caps when intering names for phone book.I have purchased many cordless phones and computers, so I am knowledgable with these items. This is not a good phone. When I received it and tried it, I wanted to send both this and the extra handset, however I would now need to pay restocking fee and return postage to 2 differant places."
1,GE DECT 6.0 SS wall mounted telephone,"In my 70 years, this is by far the worst purchase i have ever made. Handset feed=back when on speaker fone unless your 3 - 4 feet away. Voice mail can only delete if you disassemble all the menu items. This has turned me off GE and its Product line. I will look elsewhere."
4,STRAIGHT TO THE POINT ! ! !,"THIS IS A 10 SONG [REMIX] CD; OF SOME OF THE BEST KNOWN BABYFACESONGS OF THE PAST {15} YEARS!.THEY ARE TWICE AS LONG AS THE REGULAR SONG'S.WITH CRISP,TIGHT,CLEAR BASS 2 TURN THE VOLUME ON MAX!THEY ARE MENT 2 ""PARY"" 2 AS MOST OF HIS SONGSARE MENT 2 GET ""ROMANTIC"" 2.IT IS THE ONLY BABYFACE CD THAT I KNOW THAT HAS RAP ON IT.IT IS A 10 SONG CD THAT IS A HOUR LONG.IT IS A REMIX~GREATEST HITS OF THE LIVING LEGEND CALLED BABYFACE!{TONY~TONI~TON`E}/ROME,NEW YORK:HOME OF WOODSTOCK 1999"
3,How does it compare?,"I'm interested in knowing how this mattress compares to the 8"" model by Tempurpedic...anyone have any first-hand knowledge? I scoured the web, but couldn't find much information on this manufacturer, so I'm not too confident in the quality of construction. I am a huge Amazon.com fan, though, and am inclined to trust that they dont' sell junk."
3,More Information,I traced through the BBB of Boston that this company is now owned by Englander. The following is their website but doesn't seem to have any info on this particular bed. http://www.englander.com/ It shows in their list of where their plants are the location stated in the previous review. Still wasn't able to find whether these things are good or bad
1,Not much of a mattress,"I was lured by the price, and the reviews were mixed. So I ordered it. We did the right thing, let it expand for 24 hours, put it in place, and by the middle of the first hour I knew it was going back.There is little support provided by the mattress. You sink deeply into it until you have bottomed out on the box springs. I got up this morning and there was a hollow in the bed about 2 or 3 inches deep. So a soft mattress begins to feel hard as the foam compresses completely down.So our serch for a good cheap mattress continues.So my son and I will attempt to roll, and tuck this monster back into the box and ship it back to Amazon this weekend."
3,Fluffed fine - flattened fast.,It took about eight hours to fluff fully but flattened down after a few nights and stays flat - and hard.
5,We like it.,"My wife was upset when I told her I ordered it, but she liked it immediately. The first thing we noticed is that our individual movements are much more isolated, so we disturb each other less. We bought it during the winter, and noticed that it was much warmer than our conventional mattress."
5,I Like the Mattress,"I had a Spring Air Chiro Platinum that was like no mattress at all. I spent a few days in Philly and slept on a very comfortable bed. I pulled the sheets back and the mattress said World Sleep Products. I ordered this one. It is very comfortable. No more aching back and shoulders. However I would say it is not a mattress for big heavy people. I think it might bottom out. Like 10 people trying to ride in a VW bug ....Anyway, it was well worth the price! The paperwork says it is warrantied for ten years."
2,Not happy,"Bought this from a shopping network. Remote lasted 2 weeks, ordered a new remote and it's been 30 days and no replacementremote has been sent.No fault of Amazon. But I have an 1100.00 TV on the wall and can't adjust anything. I will be shipping this back Monday !!!!Picture is good."
5,An amazing array of talent! Witty and Quirky,"I was fortunate enough to see Dutch and his orchestra perform this CD live in a ""period"" concert/performance art piece in Sacramento. Visualize a smoky evenng, complete with cigarette girls, sultry sirens in 40's attire, giggalos with velvet voices crooning to the audience, and tacky charletins hawking their wares--and you'll appreciate this cd all the more. The talent, wit, and outrageous humour of this group will delight you. Make a martini, sit back on your vinyl lounge chair, and smile smile smile"
1,Worse than a 'for dummies' book,"Don't buy this unless you're a complete idiot, and are not sure how to navigate in Windows. The explanations of how to open, save and close a program are for people like my mother who still has problems with basic computer operations (like where to put the CD). There are way too many bubbles and button pictures that I can't stand to have the book open for more than 5 seconds."
5,Classic Introduction for Biblical Study,"John Nelson Darby was the father of dispensationalism. (C.I. Scofield edited Darby's system in the extremely popular ""Scofield Reference Bible."") This set of commentaries is extremely helpful to those who wish a deeper study the Holy Bible. Much more than a devotional commentary, ""The Synopsis"" gives an overview of the Bible from the dispensational, premillenial prespective. A valuable addition to any theological library. After J. Vernon McGee's ""Through the Bible,"" this is the most important commentary set to have at your disposal."
5,Such a simple yet wonderful item,"Worked perfectly. I use a 9"" pie dish and this worked perfect for a large dutch apple pie. I got rave reviews on the perfect crust and how it did not burn on the edges. I had to promise to buy these for people at Christmas."
2,Too small,"I thought it would work on my 9 inch pie. My crust started to burn, had to resirt to the foil.burned."
4,Another one that you'll love!,"Here on Air Supply's 1986 release(the duo's sixth)are some more great tunes including LONELY IS,the lone Top 40 hit. Sadly,this album didn't sell as well as the duo's first four albums did."
1,Economic Stimulus Pricing,"I guess that somebody could pay this obviously incorrect price for the item if they wanted to stimulate the economic status of the manufacturer. ""Hey - Amazon... FIX THE WEBSITE !! :-)"
5,IT WAS LOVE ---- AT FIRST SIGHT !!!!,"MY SON FELL SOOOO IN LOVE WITH THIS HORSE BEFORE I EVEN ASSEMBLED IT. WHEN I FINALLY HAD THE TIME TO PUT IT TOGETHER, I WAS QUITE NERVOUS BECAUSE MOST OF THE TIME WHEN I PURCHASE A LARGE TOY OR PIECE OF FURNITURE, THERE'S A L W A Y S SOMETHING MISSING! AND NOT JUST ANY SOMETHING, BUT THAT VITAL SCREW OR PIECES DON'T FIT. BACK TO RADIO FLYER, EVERYTHING NEEDED AND VITAL WAS THERE. THANK YOU RADIO FLYER AND AMAZON FOR BRINGING MY SON THE BRIGHTEST SMILE AND CHRISTMAS EVER!!! AND WHOAH, TALK ABOUT STURDY!! THIS HORSE WILL LAST BOTH MY BOYS PROBABLY WELL INTO THIER TEENS, OR LONGER. THEIR AGES RIGHT NOW?? 2,4 YRS OLD."
5,Nana picked a winner,"My granddaughter who is two just loves the bouncy zebra toy and she is getting too big for that so I thought maybe she would like this. SHE LOVES IT! She couldn't quite get on it by herself at first but has gotten quite good now. She tells everyone it is MINE and most of the time will not let her big sister on it. It is very well made and I think will last a lifetime, I like that the springs are covered with padded material. The only thing my husband said the rails should be padded also in case the child falls when getting on or off. For the money this is the most durable and well made toy I have ever bought."
4,Be advised two different models,"I wanted to pass on some quick information on Liberty. There are actually two different models - one with sound and one without sound. In addition I think the Liberty with sound also has a ""leather"" saddle - make sure you are getting the right Liberty that you want. I wanted the one with sound and of course I have the other one - just some information ......"
4,Not for under two,"I read reviews on this and expected my grandson who was 23 months at Christmas to be able to get on and off this spring horse without difficulty. Not so, we have to help him on and off and can't leave him alone in the room with it. I know he will enjoy it when he is a probably 2 1/2 but it is not for an average size 2 year old. We have put it up for now but hope to use it in about 6 months. It looks great and my older grandsons age 6 and 7 got on it and enjoyed sitting on it, so I think it will be good later on. It was a great buy on Amazon versus the Toysrus here."
1,It is very big and Very Ugly,"I guess I was thinking about the rocking horse that I had when I grew up. It was pretty. This horse is so ugly. It is very big for an almost two year old - long fall down that is. So unfortunately, we have put it away till he gets older/taller. On the positive side, the springs are wrapped so that your child can not pinch their fingers. It does make sounds which is cool."
2,If possible test first,"Well, my son (who is almost 3) loves to bounce on this one zebra type toy, but he is too big for it. I thought for sure he would love this toy. He was very excited, at first. We have had it for over a month and he rarely uses it. I think he may use it more when he gets older, but for now it is just sitting in our living room mainly collecting dust."
2,Poorer quality in current version,"Radio Flyer has eliminated some of the features that made this toy nicer than other spring horses, but it has retained its premium price tag. No padded leather seat anymore, just a hard plastic seat. Comfortable? How could it be? It also has other downgrades. In addition, it is manufactured in China. Radio Flyer, you can only live on reputation for so long. Look elsewhere for a better version."
1,Do not buy this toy from Amazon!,"We were very unhappy when we opened the box and found that we did not get the leather seat. The feature that most attracted us to this toy was the padded seat. We tried to be careful and order model 300, but ended up with the cheaper model 301. If we were going to do this over again, we would buy from someone else who would guarantee to send the model 300."
2,Don't get the sound option,"My in-laws gave this to my daughter as a Christmas gift and two weeks later, the sound module stopped working. I thought it might be the batteries but no such luck.I can't return it because there's no gift receipt and my daughter refuses to ride it anymore. Since the sound doesn't work, she thinks the horse itself is broken. So I'm going to have to buy a new sound module from Radio Flyer for a poorly made product.So, I suggest not paying any extra for sound. And to echo another recent review, this version comes with a plastic seat and non-adjustable stirrups."
4,Radio Flyer Spring Horse,The product is great. My only problem was that when I purchased the horse they said it would ship in 4-6 days. The next day I received an email telling me it would be another 10-14 days therefore not making it in time for christmas. I did not ike making my grandson wait for his christmas present.
3,What's All The Fuss About?,"I have read ""Theft,"" have read most of Peter Carey's previous novels, and have read the generally favorable reviews, and now I ask, ""what's all the fuss about?"" ""Theft"" is the least enjoyable Carey book I've read. I do enjoy reading about the world of art and art collectors, but this book is way too technical for all but those who are collectors themselves or work in the field. I think the hero is an unappealing and hyperactive character with whom I could not empathize in the least. And what in the world did his women find attractive about him? The only real person in the story is Hugh, for whom I award the book three stars."
2,Mostly unintelligible,"I have been a fan of Peter Carey forever and have read all his work. His work, however,has become more bizare and unreadable with each new book. Weird characters and a brilliant command of the language have always been a part of his style,Some of his stuff almost crossed the line (My Life as a Fake) to the inintelligible but Theft makes it all the way. I found the characters somewhat boring, and the language, idioms, references to times and places impossible to understand in many cases. Perhaps if you are a Sydneysider or live somwhere else in that great and beautiful country the book will make some sense. But for the rest of us---I am really sorry to report the book is not readable. I quit after reading about 2/3ds and for me that is unheard of. I feel like I have lost at good friend."
1,Bloody Awful,"When I the reviews to this book I thought to myself: this is going to be the read of the summer. So naturally, I went to my local bookstore and paid $24.00. A few hours later, I went back and returned it. It was vulgar and had a story that went absolutely nowhere. I don't know why so many liked it but it was so mean and pointless, with no execuse for its swearing. Literature isn't trash, Mr. Carey."
3,Picture Great...TV..not so much.,"The picture on this television was very nice. I state that the picture was great but the TV..not so much. I had 3 different Toshiba 50"" HDTVs delivered to my house. All three of which had the same damage. The bottom right and left corners of the screen encasement were cracked in half. I gave the rating of 3 because the TV picture I enjoyed, but it is hard to actually enjoy a 1500 dollar television when it is cosmetically flawed everytime it shows up at my door."
3,Not What I Thought,"I assumed this puzzle had individual state pieces for the puzzle. It does not. Other than that, it is a nice puzzle with a lot of information."
4,my daughter loved it,best thing is seeing your child smile. mine sure did when she saw this great bike
5,Saiyuki-Double Barrell Collection vol1,A must get dvd and lot of action and suspense in this collection a must get you will watch overand over.
2,Verticon Falls Flat,Kids played it one time and haven't touched it since. Bought the extra tower attachment which was a complete waste of money.
1,Not as good as described!,"Well, the toy just does not perform the way it's suposed to. They don't fly high in the arena and hardly EVER knock eachother out as they are suposed to do. VERY unhappy with product. HUGE disappointment for my 6 and 8 year old sons!"
2,A Big Disappointment,"The first in this trilogy is ""The Wise Virgin"" written by Jo Beverley, an interesting idea but poorly executed. Too much subjective dialog to give the story the strength it needed.The second story, ""The Vagabond Knight"", written by Margaret Moore to my surprise was boring. I've read quite a few books by her and found them to be enjoyable, but in this one, the main character just didn't come through. It was obvious what she had intended, it just didn't work, leaving him appearing weak and confused.The third story, ""The Uninvited Guest"" written by Deborah Simmons, the best writer of the three, who for some reason wrote the worst story of three, was a real let down. I've read her prior 6 books on those wonderful deBurgh males and if anyone deserved a good story it was Campion! It paled in comparison to her other works. Another good book from her is ""The Devil's Lady"", a highly likeable heroine, an interesting story, and of course, a great Knight."
4,Good Read,"This was a good book but I was very annoyed that after every couple of chapters, about 6-10 pages would be missing. So I'm hoping I didn't miss too much."
4,Good read,Scary and gripping from the fist. A little predictable near the end! Overall a good read! I would definitely recommend this book.
5,A Nightmarish Read,"Douglas Clegg has done it again!Nightmare House is perhaps Clegg's finest--and scariest--read. Though only two hundred odd pages long, the rapid-quick prose left me breathless and aching for more. This novel is the ultimate foundation for reading all the Harrow House books. So if you're a Harrow fan, read this book NOW.For fans of splatter horror, this book may not quench your appetite. Nonetheless, the atmospheric mood and in-depth characterization (and detailed history of the 1920's) breathes life into the words. I promise you that you'll start seeing shadows move and hear things go bump if you spend just ONE night reading Nightmare House.If only more books were like this one...Bravo! Mr. Clegg!"
1,Maybe I'm reading the wrong book?????,"So far, I'm on page 107 of a 218 page story and nothing even remotely scary has happened. The constable is rambling on and on and on about good cigars and the little quirks and eccentricities of the towns-people. Page-turner??? I'm having a hard time staying awake in order to turn the next page!"
2,Confusingly Developed,"This book began slowly, developed slowly, and ended blandly. Nothing was well explained or well developed. Some portions began to develop the story and characters, led the reader to think a good story was being grown, only to end with nothing developed or explained."
1,Nightmare House,"Will try some of his other books, but this one did not impress. In fact will not bother with the remainder of the Harrow series. No horror, nothing really even spooky. Don't understand why it got such high reviews. Will try Goat Dance."
4,good old fashioned horror,"Nightmare House was a good read, kept me interested throughout and without the gore of some horror books, just good old fashioned twists and turns,"
3,Nightmare house,Not the kind of book I normally read. I guess I have to say it was ok since I finished it
4,Fantastic,I became a fan of Cleggs many years back. Once I had read everything that was out I never really followed his books any more. I recently received a kindle for Christmas and immediately thought to search for him as an author. I'm so happy I did. Many new books for me to read now. Great book and even better series.
4,A good album,"This is a solid and good free-jazz album. Not a masterpiece like the albums the man he's paying tribute to did but definitely worth listening to. The music is closer to the ""ESP""-free jazz sound (brown recorded for that label) than the Sanders/shepp/coltrane approaches."
3,Could have been a better Melissa & Doug,I have had much better experience with other Melissa & Doug products. The train set is not bad but I rate it only 3* since it is not something that will grab a toddler's attention for more than 15 minutes. And not something he would want to go back and play with.
2,Too Long,"I purchased this thinking it was the other alphabet floor puzzle with the good review, but this one is ten feet long and connects one to one. I purchased it to help my toddler learn the alphabet, but it just takes up too much floor space and it the pictures are not very fun so the alphabet part of it seems to not to come across well enough. Quality is good if your looking for this type of puzzle."
5,"Sturdy, great for learning alphabet, nice inexpensive gift","My [...] really likes this train puzzle. He knows his alphabet and is able to pick out which puzzle piece comes next in line and attach it. It goes straight across and is over 10 feet long. There is also a picture with each letter on the piece and this has helped him with words beginning with that letter. He will say ""Q quail"" or ""N nut"" when he is putting the piece on. The pieces are easy to attach, thick and very sturdy. The pieces comes apart with no worry of ripping the picture off. This would make a really nice gift for a 2-4 year old. The box is also very nice to keep the puzzle in."
2,"I usually adore Melissa and Doug products, but not this one!","We bought this Alphabet train puzzle for our two year old for Christmas. We already have 9 other puzzles by Melissa and Doug and my kids love them. This puzzle is a 10 foot long train and in two different places the picture doesn't line up between two pieces. It is the alphabet, so I know that the pieces are in the correct order but you try to teach kids to line up the picture when you do a puzzle and you can't with this one.This definitely is not the quality that we expect from this company. We are disappointed."
5,Our son loves it,"Our son starting playing with this puzzel at 2 1/2 years and he's 3 now and still loves building the ""alphabet train"". He loves trains and saying the alphabet, so this is a really fun activity for him and the whole family. Each time he picks the correct letter to attach on the train, he shouts ""chugga chugga choo choo!"" with a huge, proud smile."
5,Fantastic first puzzle,This puzzle helps in two ways- it shows kids how puzzle pieces fit together while teaching the ABC's. really a great idea. Pieces fit together well but may require help snapping together the first few times.
2,Beware-X is not for fox!,"We recieved this as a present and my son was very excited to put it together. The pictures are nice and the big size makes it fun. As with any alphabet activities, we enjoyed practicing our letters by saying, ""C is for Cow,"" etc. But when we got to X we were shocked to see they put a fox. The age range for the puzzle will expect the traditional ""X is for..."" set up and not be looking for the letter in the final position. They did U is for umbrella so why they felt they had to do fox for x is unclear. We love most Melissa & Doug items, but fell that this one missed on this. We have to keep correcting our little one that X is not for fox!"
1,Where is the 'C',"At first I thought this was a great puzzle and would have given it 5 stars; the pictures are great, it is sturdy and it fits together well. But I guess my son will have to learn his A B Ds because the C is missing! This makes the alphabet train pretty worthless. I'm sure this is cut all at once so where did the C go? We opened the box and pulled the pieces out one by one as we put it together so I know the C didn't get lost. Now I get to try to find a box and packing material and take time from work to go ship it back. Maybe it isn't worth it."
4,LONG puzzle,"I purchased this puzzle for my grandson who loves trains more than puzzles. There is no real challenge in putting this ten foot long puzzle together but it is VERY educational. The alphabet letters are printed clearly in both capital and small letters, and the pictures are very colorful. When my grandson no longer wishes to play with it as a puzzle, my daughter plans to mount the puzzle on his bedroom wall. A puzzle, a toy, a learning aid, and a room decoration... what more could you ask for?"
3,ok,"way too much stretch. My wife ski's at an expert level and fell twice. That is more that I have seen her fall in the previous 5 years. I used it for wakeboard and found that the removable lenghts are not where you would want it. I had to tie a knot in the last section about a two thirds of the way back. I will buy another rope before skiing again. Understandably, this is a great item for the non serious. If you are halfway good, BUY A GOOD quality rope the first time, unlike me that now has to buy another rope anyway!"
5,some of bukowski's best work,classic bukowskilong narrative thoughtful poetry carefully planned and executed regardless of how he may have described his own techniqe herethe ending short poem is classic
5,This is the book you are looking for . . .,"With jobs so scarce lately, I thought I'd spend my time reviewing basic skills while I waited for the phone to ring. One of the skills employers and agencies test for admin jobs is spelling. When jobs are plentiful, who cares. I get 100% on word processing tests; I know how to use spell check. Since I have to compete for a limited number of jobs, I got serious about each test.This book starts with a mammoth list of commonly misspelled words. It's great as a reference. Skip to the chapters with the rules. I did a read through followed by a close reading of the first three rules chapters. I got 100% on a computerized spelling test for business and legal terms today -- which didn't include the obvious words like mortgage, committee, bookkeeping, and government. I know I would have gotten several of the test words wrong if I hadn't reviewed this book.My next purchase in this series will be Business Mathematics the Easy Way."
5,Beautiful!,"I purchased this to use as a wall hanging in a bedroom with an Asian decor. It is gorgeous - rich, bright colors and it's very big. Well worth the price. In fact, I would be willing to pay more. Received it quickly, too. Overall I am very pleased with the purchase."
4,Aging surprisingly well,"The essays in this book are speculative, but most of the book consists of reviews of ""where we have been, where we are now"" with cautious extrapolations towards the future. There are a few exceptions, but I skimmed them: I'll read a good SF novel instead.Published in 1996, as a body the essays have aged very well. There has been a great deal of progress in neuroscience in the last decade, and it continues to pace ahead. Still, this is a good book for getting up to speed and virtually every paragraph is easily understood by laymen.I found four spelling errors in my hardcover copy."
2,Very dated,"I find this novel has not aged well. While Trey Ellis is trying to poke fun at the contrived nature of Black literary politics from the mid-1980s, he ends up presenting a very weak caricature of how a feminist author would write. I actually found the novel pretty insulting, particularly as the meta-narrative comes to its extremely predictable ending. For me, the fact that Ishmael Reed was a vocal advocate of this novel says it all."
1,"Works great, BUT","I have had this little blower for over a week now. I got it to quickly clean off a small deck and the table and chairs. It works great so far. No complaints.BUTIt has a horrible petroleum odor - almost like it has been soaked in gasoline. Since I use it outside, it does not bother me when I am using it. But it is stinking up the closet where it is being stored.I noticed that it is made in China, and the following notice is printed on the outside of the box:""WARNINGThis product may contain chemicals known to the State of CA to cause cancer and/or birth defects or otherreproductive harm.""I am sure that I would never have purchased it if I had known this in advance."
5,Best Bang for the Bucks,"I run a computer repair business, and I do a lot of cleaning out the insides of desktop PC's. I've tried many portable vacuums & blowers, but this ""Blower/Vacuum"" is definately the best in it's league. It has a very powerful combination blower/suction that is perfect for vacuuming and blowing the dust & dirt from computer casings. Because of the power, it is a little noisy indoors; but I highly recomend this product! Best Bang for the Bucks!"
2,Worked great for a year,"Worked great for about a year, then just suddenly died and would not start up. Since it was cheap to begin with I will buy another cheap one. You get what you pay for, just don't expect a long life."
2,Promising device... BUT...,"Ordered this based on the positive reviews. When I first got it, I was very impressed considering the $17 price tag. I ran it for a few minutes the first day just to make sure it worked OK. On day two, I used it to dry my car. After a couple of minutes it sounded like it was slowing down and began emitting a burning smell and the sparks inside the motor (from the DC brushes) seemed very excessive. I figured the bearings were fine because it coasted down normally when the power was turned off. It came with a 2nd set of DC brushes, so I replaced them. I got the same results...it started a full speed but began to slow down after a couple minutes until it finally would not turn on at all.Amazon allowed me to return it for a refund. I plan on looking for a better quality model for my next purchase."
1,This product is crap.,This product is useless. The motor overheated and seized after just a few minutes of blowing dust from a computer chassis. Look somewhere else if you are looking forward to using it more than once. It is so cheap that returning it would be more of a hassle.
1,don't waste $ on this,Shiped fast! broken fast! the worst thing I ever bought. I only used it 4 times. amount of time it work not over 10 min. don't waste your money
2,okay product,for less tha $10 it is okay for blowing watre off your car but I needed it for was to remove leaves off my small apartment patio and it does not blow hard enough.
1,Do not buy!,"The reviews for this product seemed ok enough to buy this item. Well, I guess you do get what you pay for...this item was quite inexpensive as for as blowers go.To make a kinda long story short, this blower DIED within 1 minute after I started using it. Fortunately, the company was very receptive and I was refunded almost immediately.This blower is now in the garbage awaiting the dump!"
4,Best sounding new act in years,"The title track, Godzilla is a remake of a Blu Oyster Cult tune from the 70s. This song has been given the full frontall Superfuzz attack and, in my opinion, would have been a much better choice for the movie soundtrack than that wimpy song from Jamrockquell or whatever their name is.Anyway the CD rocks. I especially tripped hard on the song Out of Her Mind. Put me outta my mind!Great CD guys, give us more."
4,If you love Goldens,"This is a very cute family movie, especially if you have Goldens and kids or grandkids!"
4,Hilarious!,"Can you imagine seeing a dog hitting a ball with a baseball bat? I can understand soccer, basketball, and maybe football, but baseball? I think all of the Airbuds are funny, but this is definitely the funniest. Espeacially Rocky the Racoon. If you've seen the other Airbuds, you'll be surprised when you watch this one, because it's not Josh playing baseball, it's his younger sister Andrea! It's not the best of the Airbud series, but you'll fall in love with the funny cast of characters!"
1,Laughable Disgrace of a Movie,"Okay, I didn't like the first Air Bud film, or the second. This film, however, doesn't deserve the name ""Disney"" any more than Air Bud deserves to be referred to as a Dachshund. Disney owes it to the movie watching audience to put Air Bud to an eternal sleep."
1,Flimsy,"The case broke coming out of the package! Not well put together. I'm afraid it won't hold up on the road, and that pretty much defeats the purpose."
4,Nifty little gadget puts you ahead of the game!,"We purchased this device because it seems the battery often dies when you're nowhere near a wall to charge it, and carrying a spare battery doesn't always help, so this was a great idea! As an added bonus the solar charger can also charge the Game Boy Advanced (at the same time!!). We were highly amused that the solar charger is basically the shell of a GBA with solar panels where the screen and controls would be. That means it fits in a standard game carry case. It's also a fantastic idea for military members headed downrange where there's plenty of sun but not always plenty of electrical outlets. Very economical, eco-friendly, and convenient."
1,Not suitable for children,"I thought I was pretty safe with Hello Kitty, but I guess not. To quote the Snow White story, ""Take this arrow and kill Snow White. Bring it back to me with her blood on it so that I know she's dead."" Not much of a kids movie. Stay away from this one."
5,Andrienne Wilson's tour de force,"Andrienne Wilson is a jazz talent who merits wider recognition. Her artistry shines in She's Dangerous, her second CD. Her incredible abilities as a multi-octave vocalist, composer, flautist, and arranger are truly the workings of a mature artist. Wilson presents material mostly her own-which could easily become jazz standards because of their brilliance. Andrienne sings of love and relationships in a way that draws the listener in. Try ""Please Don't Say""-you'll hear a heartfelt criticism of those who look at relationships as a battlefield conquest, not as a communion in love. The title track is a refreshing statement of a woman living life centered in her own personal power. Wilson has an all-star band assembled for the date which is one of the most stimulating performances on record in the last few years. Discover Andrienne Wilson and enter into a new level of jazz musicianship, performance and communication."
5,"Finally, an explanation for the human ear (and more).","Why are ears so freakish and weird, even more alien than the roofs of our mouths or the gnarled depths of our bellybuttons? If you think all that showy cauliflowery serves a purpose, you're wrong. Thanks to the exhaustive research of Dr. Doris Haggis-on-Whey (and her eversmiling sidekick, Benny), we now know who to blame: Fernando de la Mancini-Goldfarb, the infamous procrastinator and inventor who designed the ear in a rush of poor-planning one night in 1911. It all makes sense now, no?""Your Disgusting Head"" is packed with similarly illuminating facts, drawings, and diagrams, each specially designed to edify and entertain -- the perfect panacea for all the gift-buying challenges in your life, from the littlest child to the tallest adult."
5,this book is so good I don't know what to do with myself,"There are a couple of misleading numbers in the description of this book, where it says that it's for ages 9-12 and that it's 64 pages long. Sure, it's for ages 9-12, and for ages 19, 29, 39.... the humor is a substantial notch more clever than ""The Secret Knowledge of Grownups"" (which my kid loves, so no criticism implied; he gets 100% of the humor in that book, whereas a certain percentage of this book would be over his head, or at least he wouldn't completely understand why I'm laughing so hard). Also, the 64 pages add up to more than 64 pages of a regular kids' book would be; as in Jon Stewart's ""America,"" there's a lot crammed into a regular page. (Of course there are a few pages that aren't too complex.) This book is pretty similar to ""America,"" actually.This book is marvelously multilayered; kids will love it because it's silly and adults will love it because the absurdities are just so much fun and so artfully done."
4,My 3-year old son loves it!,My son is really into dinosaurs lately so this was a great gift from Santa. Only complaint I have is there is a gap between the frame and puzzle so puzzle pieces don't fit snug in the wood frame when finished.
5,Yea,Our 3 year old grandson is big into dinosaurs and this really appealed to him. Colored nicely and the pieces fit well and it looks like it'll stand a lot of punishment. We are very pleased with the quality and appearance.
4,Excellent Gift,Came in plenty of time. Excellent condition on delivery. Seems well made and durable. Pieces fit together and come apart easily. Colors are bright and engaging. Frame could be a little bit more decorative though well made.
4,Exciting music from african duo with a pop bent,"Hijas del Sol is a superb duo (aunt and nephew) from Equatorial Guinea, a former spanish colony in West Africa. Singing in spanish and the local language of Bubi, they deserve to be better known. The best tracks in my opinion are 1, 3, 6, and 7. Their music combines the traditional with the modern in a exciting way."
4,Good Overview Ravi Shankar's Career,"This box set is a good overview of Ravi Shankar's career. The classical Cd is especially good. Perhaps the set should have been at least 6 cd's with the additional discs being pure classical since R.S does constantly insists he is a purely classical musician.I find parts of the East-West and Vocal and Experimentation disc to be dated and contrived ,not too interesting after a few listenings and as a result I rarely play these discs.Listening to this set will enhance your appreciation for Indian classical music and for Pandit Ravi Shankar.The accompanying booklet is quite nice , although I would suggest R. Shankars book Raga-Mala. I also think that the current remastered Angel CD 's are a good value. For those looking for good overview of Hindustani music check out the Raga Guide: Survey 74 Hindustani Ragas ."
5,captivating,"It's true, the quality of the music varies greatly from disc to disc and sometimes from track to track, but that's a concomitant of the fun, part of the exploring. My favorite piece is the Yehudi Menuhin collaboration. (Mr. Menuhin reveals in his autobiography he never learned to improvise, but you couldn't tell it by this: he plays with conviction and spontaneity.) The ""classical"" disc is consistently good; the movements for sitar and orchestra are fascinating; the pop song ""I Am Missing You"" is amusing. The set is attractively packaged and includes a lengthy biography of Ravi Shankar with historically significant photographs.Also recommended (for sitar players too): PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns."
2,Review of the Universal Pet Pad : Bucket Seat,"Pros : Material is lightweight and easy to cleanCons : Material can be slippery, dogs jumping up and down can be tricky.Because of this, there should be more fasteners, eg at the middle using elasticcords. The fasteners could also be better made and with more options, andusing elastic cords instead of the loop typeThe material they use (part of pvc pipe) to insert into the seat gap to holdthe seat in is simply not suitable. If it were leather seats, your leatherwould be scratched in no time. I improvised and replaced it with a rubber one"
5,New OS X Leopard Family pack,"This is really a great new operating system for Mac. One purchase and I was able to upgrade all four Mac in our family. Microsoft should learn a lesson and do the same when they do an upgrade to the OS. Anyway, we all lovbe the new features in Leopard, including the neat, new utilities."
2,say good bye to final cut,"if you don't have a reason beyond ""it's new"" to upgrade my advice is ""for the love of God - DON'T""."
2,Wait till bugs are fixed,"There are still multiple issues within this version of the OS. I recently upgraded from Tiger and after 1 week of use I have decided to go back. Since using Leopard my productively has drop to nearly nothing because I spend most of my time trying to fix patches, or trying to figure out a work-around since I have so many problems with certain programs. Among many smaller problems I have run into the most serious issues I have with Leopard are the ones below.Mail: wouldn't let me log onto my companies IMAP sever. Talked with Apple on this issues and no one could figure it out. They told me they have no clue and will submit the issue to the engineers.Power Point: crashes every time, with no sign of being able to fix.Simply put, just hang-on to your version of Tiger and wait till they fix all the issues with Leopard."
5,"An excellent OS, but buy ""Missing Manual"" by Pogue","I am very impressed by the new OS from Apple, and it far exceeds my expectations. I upgraded largely to ensure the best compatibility with new third party applications, but there are many great features here in mail, iCal, security, multi-tasking, and so on.I have two tips:1 - Buy ""The Missing Manual"" by David PogueMac OS X Leopard: The Missing Manual[NYT Columnist, some say humorist, and Mac geek]. His book helped me understand how to get the most out of this OS which would have taken too much time otherwise.2 - When upgrading do a completely erase and install. Of coarse back up your data first on an external HD or in the cloud with Jungle Disk.Enjoy."
1,Don't Buy Family Pack,"Only ONE single DVD install disc comes in the family pack (for 5 users). You cannot create duplicate install discs for each user - any copies created look/verify as perfect but are not bootable, so cannot be used for emergencies. Not good a good buy for families with busy, independent teens who need their own install disc!"
1,Should not be sold till it's ready,"The Leopard ""improvement"" should not have been sold or recommended by Amazon untill the interface with AOL was fixed. One cannot attach documents and if one is responding to an Aol Tech Support Email, the program crashes. Apple should have done better than to put this on the market with what is for many of us some woeful glitches."
5,Longtime mac user,"As a long time mac user (who happens to use Vista all day for work), I can tell you this is a *nice* OS. It's a joy to use on my Mac Pro, and a definite step up from Vista. I dual boot, and with Tiger installed before, I didn't even bother booting into OS X after work. But now with 10.5.2, I boot into Leopard everyday. On my Mac Pro, 10.5.2 is polished and butter smooth, and browsing and email is a much better experience vs. Vista."
3,"Great features, but as of today it still has a lot of kinks...","Great update, too bad Apple couldn't work all the kinks out first. As of early December 2007 this new OS needs fixing, but I'd buy it again and know that apple will fix everything with updates over time."
1,What a mess,"Defective CD caused my fiance to lose contents of his hard drive with no hope of recovery. Apple Tech support suggested a re-install of prior OS X version. We knew to back up the contents, however, so many friends had no trouble, he didn't bother. What a mess! Apple has offered to replace CD, however, they won't mail to APO address...which is why we ordered from amazon to begin with. BACK UP YOUR FILES prior to an install! Where is quality control? I gave it one star because the system won't allow 0 stars."
3,"Leopard has trouble ""spots""!","Ever since have have had OS 10.5, otherwise called Leopard, I have had problems with settings and peripherals. My printer no longer prints on our wireless network even with driver updated. I finally decided I will keep my printer plugged in and wait for the companies to do what they need to do. My very common asp Roadrunner has had trouble handing my e-mail. Apple did straighten that out after talking with a number of their staff. My asp helpers were clueless. I guess I'm going through the growing pains as many have with MS Vista-although my problems haven't been nearly as bad as that fiasco. Actually Leopard is a great product, but there a some trouble spots that need fixing."
4,Ms. Swenson,"I like the Leopard, and I have shared it with family members who also have a MAC. They agree that it is easy to use. The only thing I had to do...that I'm aware of ... is update RealPlayer. But that was very easy. This has some interesting ways of reminding me of things, and there are still some things I can't find. But I'm a slow learner, and I have to get with my ""tutor"" to be able to upgrade my brain. But so far, I have not found anything I don't like about it."
5,Prompt and perfect OS X!,"Much needed OS X update works beautifully on my ""ancient"" G4 Mac. Thank you for being so prompt!"
4,Good Leopard,"I found Leopard a little tricky to install on my g4. Othere than that, the product has been good."
2,"A Disaster for ""Power-PC"" Macs.","This OS is nice and well enough designed for Intel processor machines, but for ""Power-PC"" processor Macs, it's a debacle. I have one of the last of the G5 iMacs (20"") and it never crashed at all with Mac OS 10.4. But with 10.5, IT WILL CRASH EVERY SINGLE TIME I use iTunes. Sometimes it crashes when I'm using iTunes, and sometimes it will crash after I use that program and quit the application. It doesn't seem to matter what I do. And yes, this is a legal, registered version of the OS. And yes, I have re-installed it twice, all to no effect. Apple has some serious work to do to make this latest OS viable for their not-too-distant machines. I hear they are completely giving up on their G-Series machines with OS 10.6, so if you have 10.4, hold on to it and don't let go. Until Apple figures it out (IF they even try), users should avoid this OS.Thanks for reading,-CL"
5,Great product and timely arrival,I love OSX Leopard. It arrived within the delivery time and I have been more productive using it.
4,Solid Upgrade,"There's no one single feature of this upgrade that jumped out and made me buy it. Instead, a bunch of small upgrades to almost every area of the operating system combine to make a whole that truly is more than the sum of its parts."
5,Leopard Family Pack,Great product as expected from Apple. Installation was very easy.Great price as expected from Amazon.
5,Mac OSx Leopard 5-user Upgrade (Family Pack),Very easy to upgrade all of the Macs in our home. Obviously we are Apple happy !!!
1,Not for Power PC Macs,"Apple Mac OS X Version 10.5 Leopard [5-User Family Pack]This may work well for Intel based Macs but is close to a disaster for Power PCs or at least for the PowerBook G4s we use in our company (1.5ghz and 1GB SDRAM). Speed has slowed to a crawl. E.g., to restart takes 10-15 minutes even after deducting for numerous timeouts. There is a pronounced delay when saving, opening files when changing applications etc. Stay with the old OS or trash the hardware and buy a new Intel based Mac."
2,"Slick, but....","There are a lot of gushing reviews on this new OS, and why not? Leopard is the smartest OS I've ever used, and the prettiest. But if you're wondering how much this OS is really going to cost you, take a deep breath. The upgrades I need to get my essential software running on this OS total more than $2000, and that's more than I can afford (and more than the price of the most expensive iMac). For example, my older Adobe package won't run on 10.5, and the upgrade is over $1300. In fact, the only older software I've found that does run on Leopard is Appleworks 6 and a few shareware programs. Now how is it that an old Claris software program can still work without a hitch and nothing else does? Apple and its software providers need to rethink their marketing strategy. I, for one, am not made of money."
5,TFP Betters With Age,"I have always liked TFP...with and without Scott Radinsky. This release is their first full length in several years...much awaited and maybe their last. It is maybe their best, as their music and lyrics mature with them. The lyrics are just as emotional and meaningful as ever, and the music, as hard driving as ever, would satisfy even the youngest hardware-store faced teen! But don't be fooled, this edition of TFP is thoughtful and meaningful and the songs will stick in your head. This is great and I recommend to any ""true"" punk or emo fan."
2,Not So Great,"Ten Foot Pole was better when Scott was in the band. The band has changed a lot depending on how you view them. The band has moved away from their raw punk energy that Scott delivered and is trying to appeal to MTV fanatics. If you like Green Day style pop-punk, this is for you. But Bad Religion and NOFX fans should buy Rev instead."
3,Quirky characters,"This was an enjoyable book, but I was a little disappointed near the end. It started out good, but lost it's steam three quarters of the way through."
3,Too many Brits spoil the blues,"Despite their good intentions, the producers invited too many Brits aboard. The songs end up cluttered and the parts by Beck et al seem punched in. A better album to really hear Rogers in the best setting is his 1990 album for the Antone's label, LUDELLA, where he's surrounded by people who have worked with for many years and aren't taking a vacation from being rock stars."
4,"Jimmy Rogers ,His Legacy Should Always Be Remembered","This CD is a pleasant surprise and shows some heavyweights banding together to honour an influence on them all.Unfortunately Jimmy Rogers died soon after the sessions,but this can double as a tribute to him.The songs express all that is infectious and pleasing about the rocking blues.The energy and feeling put into this recording by the likes of Clapton Jagger and Plant make a welcome for them.Taj Mahal is great and this should spark a desire in anybody to seek out Jimmy Rogers past catalogue.This collection is well produced and would be a welcome collection to anybodys blues library."
5,If you buy one blues album - make it this one!!!,I bought this CD predicated on reading the online reviews. This is not to be missed!!!
4,Very Good,"When I heard this CD I was pleased with the result of probably some enjoyable afternoons of fellowmusicians jamming through the day. In some songs it worked less and then you just hear the 12 bar blues that anyone can play, but on the other hand, these songs are helped by the great singing of Jimmy Rogers, Taj Mahal and Robert Plant which makes all these songs special. This is a very good CD. And although it's a CD full of easy songs they do not bring these songs like anybody can do. You may think that anybody could, in the beginning, but after you listen some more times, you'll realize that this is a great CD."
2,Doesn't live up to the later version...,"I was disappointed with this longer version of The Mill on the Floss. I thought, being BBC and a long version it would be a definitive one, but I have to agree with the other reviewer. This version left out some very important events, and emotions seemed washed out rather than passionate and moving. I like long movies, but this dragged because it just doesn't hold your attention. The 1997 Masterpiece Theatre version is so much more powerful, and keeps all important events intact, spending less time on Maggie's mother worrying about the fate of her china, and more on character and plot development, with a very haunting score. I really hope the other version is released on DVD-if so, I will probably donate this one to the library, because I can't quite see myself rewatching it. I would rather read the book, instead."
2,not sure about this one,"Well I watched about 15mins of this version and turned it off, seems slow going and thick, will have to sit and try to watch it a second time...not sure if I will make it thru the whole thing!!!"
1,It was not what I had expected.,"This book appears in the mandalas section, and it does not include ANY information about mandalas. I was very very disapponinted."
1,Too loud,"I ordered this chickadee thinking that it would have the ""chicka-dee-dee-dee-dee"" sound. I was disappointed to hear the two two-toned sound only. And it is very loud."
5,Secondary usage,Our Bernese Mountain Dog loves these birds. They work for him since he is extremely gentle with his toys aka friends.
2,Not what I thought,I listened to the previews of the songs and they sounded perfect to teach Tai Chi. But when I got it.... it was NOT at all useable for that. My bad.
4,"""Butterfly Lovers"" not good as expected","I have heard of four versions of ""Butterfly Lovers"" violin concerto by Li-Na Yu with Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, Takako Nishizaki With New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, Siqing Lu and at last this title performed by Vanessa-Mae. To my disappointment, Vanessa-Mae's performance is neither loyal to original folklore nor deeply constructed. Li-Na Yu's recording still deserves the authoritive status. Takako Nishizaki probably can take second place.However, other works in this albums are better."
5,In a nutshell: My best CD,"I really like this CD. It is so beautiful and it she is so great. I love the way she has such a wide variety of playing. I really want her new album ""Storm."" I played the violin for a year and I did not appreciate it. Vanessa Mae is really an inspiring person. She is really pretty and can play really well so it makes little kids want to play music and listen to classical. If you are a fan of violin, classical, Vanessa Mae, or all get this CD! I strongly recommend it to a son or daughter that does not like classical. It helps acquire some enjoyment out of the genre."
1,Vanessa Mae has no place in the classical world,"Vanessa Mae should seriously consider leaving the world of classical music and concentrate fully on the commercial marketing hype that she is so good at....The Butterfly Lovers is a beautiful piece, but many say that Vanessa Mae has played very well simply because there aren't many famous violinists out there who record this. There is a much better version by Takako Nishizaki. In fact the interpretations with Traditional Chinese musical instruments such as er-wu, pipa (conducted by Henry Shek, the acclaimed conductor in China) express this violin concerto even more lyrically.I don't know whether this is due to the process of the recording or because of Vanessa Mae's playing herself, but her techniques are poor and at times it just sounds like a junior hacksaw sawing a lump of metal."
4,Smoke From This Altar,"This was a great buy. I bought it for a friend who is a Louis LaMour fan and he only needed this book to round out his collection. It is an old book, but except for a few signs of 'wear' it was in great shape."
1,I didn't read the description well enough,"I thought this book was a group of his normal western stories and was thrilled to have found it. But it's POEMS! I don't care how good the poetry is and even though Louis L'Amour, my husband's favorite author, he won't read it so it was returned."
5,One You'll Go Back To Over and Over Again.,"I picked this up in a used bookstore a few months ago and have not put it down since. I love poetry and read it everyday, and this has become my favorite book of poems.Keep in mind most of these poems were written when L'Amour was a young man our traveling the world, long before he became the revered storyteller of his later years. And with that in perspective, it only makes the work more impressive.If you're intimidated by poetry or just ""don't get it,"" this is a good volume to start with. It's not ""high brow"" poetry in the old English sense. It won't send you to the dictionary every other word. But it will take you to distant lands aboard ships and ports of call, and it will call to you on the inside like all great poetry does. In short it will move you.If you love L'Amour's novels, do give this little volume of poems a try. Even if he'd not become the popular writer he was, this work would stand on its own."
4,Australian Arm,"This is a good album, not classic, but interesting. It feautures Mark Arm (of Mr. Epp/Green River/Mudhoney/Monkeywrench-fame), Martin Bland (of The Monkeywrench), and vocalist E.J. Renstaire. The music is like a mix of Mudhoney with an AC/DC-type singer minus Steve Turner's lead guitar. Best track by far is ""The Past Is A Coming"" featuring Arm on backup chorus vocals."
4,...and another 100 people...,"I bought this album after seeing an amazing performance of the show, and it was the song 'Another 100 people' that made me want it. Though I cannot say it is better then the live showing I saw, it still brings back the memories of poor little Bobbys life. 'Ladys Who Lunch' is wonderful, as is 'Not Getting married Today'. The accents are a little much, and sometimes annoying, but its a stage show, what do you expect."
2,Not for everyone,"""Company"" is my favorite Sondheim show, and out of the four recordings of it that I have, this is my least favorite. The CD does not leave me satisfied and haunted as the original Broadway CD does. The singers evoke no passion, and the orchestra is too synthesizer-dependent. The only track of note on this CD is Veanna Cox's ""Getting Married Today"" - her diction is unbelievable, but she, as the other singers so, seems to leave behind the feeling that is supposed to go into the song. This is at best an interesting buy for those who are already familiar with the score, but for first-time listeners: go with the original."
5,"That&#65533;s what it&#65533;s all about, isn&#65533;t it?","I bought this CD the summer before I entered the sixth grade. The month before, I had seen a production of it at a community theatre in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma (where I am forced to live). I am now in the 8th Grade and still love this show, and this recording. LaChanze is excellent as she soars her was through ""ANOTHER HUNDRED PEOPLE"". The Broadway diva Debra Monk (star of Sondheim's ASSASSINS and Ebb/Kander's STEEL PIER) leaves a mark on the role of Joanne with her renditions of ""THE LADIES WHO LUNCH"" and ""THE LITTLE THINGS YOU DO TOGETHER"". Boyd Gaines is in good voice with ""SOMEONE IS WAITING"", ""BEING ALIVE"", and espcially the new addition ""MARRY ME A LITTLE"". Veanne Cox is a major plus on ""GETTING MARRIED TODAY"", as is Jane Krakowski on ""BARCELONA"". The girlfriend's trio of ""YOU COULD DRIVE A PERSON CRAZY"" is perfection and the cast's rendition of the title song is breath-taking. SONDHEIM ROCKS!"
2,Cool Puzzle- Edges Break Easily***SPLINTERS****,This puzzle is beautiful and my 4 year old loves it- except for the splinters it gives her. I'd not recomend this one unless it was made of cardboard.
4,Finally!,"I too have been looking for this album, going on 10 years. I searched many other online music stores and struck out everywhere until I came here to Amazon."
5,One of the best if notthe best,I have searched for this for years and finally Amazon made it possible. Once again Air Supply finds a way to touch even the darkest of hearts. They continue to show their wide range of talents. I for one hope they continue for years to come.
3,It's ok for the money,"I have 2 of these in my 55 gallon saltwater tank; one for the protein skimmer and the other for the return from the sump. We took a few quick off/on power hits during one of the big snow storms we had and suddenly there was no water from the return. I pulled the pump out and took the impeller housing off only to find the impeller ate itself alive. I now have the one from the skimmer on the return and don't have a skimmer until I get another. I am trying to find a better pump for the same money. If not, I will have to go with another one of these.These are very loud and they do get very hot even though they are submerged."
1,Forget This company!,"The camera is just ok. No better and no worse than most others out there I've seen; and difinitely not any better than the webcam that came built into my Sony Vaio. The cordless earpiece is worthless, with very mushy sound. BUT the worst of all is this companies absolute zero customer service. After trying every way possible to get through for tech support I've chucked the whole thing. I have left several messages that the computer voice promised to return in in 1-24 hours and I've never heard from this company. I will never, ever purchase another Ezonics product."
2,The Bluetooth headset's better than the webcam!,"I'm wondering if there's plutonium in this thing because the Bluetooth headset piece holds a charge forever in storage, and I'm still trying to use it to drain the thing! Never seen anything like it. Please tell me the name of the company making this rechargeable battery!That said, the webcam is rather low quality and not good in low light, software's a bit quirky using on my iBook G4. It works well enough and in bright light it's acceptable. Stills from it are very lo-res and grainy. It's ok i guess, but the BT headpiece outshines it, and you can use the BT dongle on computers without BT for small file transfers like text files, but it takes way too long for mp3's etc. which I guess is to be expected from Bluetooth?I was surprised to see the $99. price tag on this and I'd look for used before paying that much, or for something else. Make sure to factor in what it'd cost for a BT headpiece too, though, if you need one."
5,A wonderful and moving album,This is a great and affordable CD highlighting the best of Shankar's 'In Celebration' album. It contains both instrumental and vocal songs which are very moving and uplifting to the Hindu soul! Jai Ravi Shankar!
5,Great Stuff !,"This was my first Saw Doctors disc and I was very impressed. I have always been a huge Pogues fan and enjoyed traditional Irish music as well. This is a nice balance of tunes. ""To win just once"" describes my soccer team perfectly."
5,Brilliant,The Best Thing To Come Out Of Ireland Since Guinness. Every CD by the Doc's is a equally brilliant as the next. You will feel good instantly from the first note of each song!
5,Misnach,"OUTSTANDING ALBUM! Seems that every song on this CD is a hit! From a Travel Channel favorite, like ""The Green and Red of Mayo"" to a brilliant overture like Sing a Powerful Song"", or a fun and lively song like N17, the whole CD rings a liveliness and fun to listen to brilliance that only the Beatles have done in the past."
3,"Grows old fast, but first few listens are really fun.","My older brother and I agree on this one. Many of the songs (especially the first 7-8) sound great the first 3-4 times, but they grow old very quickly after that. We concluded that the songs and writing must be generally thin. The band is good and fun live."
5,Awsome!!!!!! These guys are the best thing since U2.,"I have followed The Sawdoctors for about three years now, every year they are more fun to see. When you listen to their CD's you enjoy the music, but when you see them live, you feel like they sing every song for you. Definately a feel good group. Keep up the great work Davy, Leo, Pearce, Johnny and Derek."
5,"""Sing a Powerful Song"" is an excellent album.","I happened on to the Saw Doctors a couple of months ago at Borders (sorry) and since then the album has been a constant companion to my CD changer. They have a modern, down-home sound that is difficult to ignore. Listening to their music reminds me of mom and apple pie, only the apple pie is cooked in a microwave and mom is wearing Harley-Davidson leather. Blending of musical styles often times fails, yet the Saw Doctors have somehow found a way to make it work. I can hear shadows of REM, Springstein, and Sting in their music. The lyrics are real, almost scenic, and they steer clear of cynicsm and romanticism.. The Saw Doctors are an excellent band and ""Sing a Powerful Song"" is an excellent album."
1,Wrong message for my daughter,Very negative message. My daughter was excited to wear her glasses and questioned why the character in this book was so embarrasseed by her glasses and eye patching. Wrong message for my child.
2,Ehh...,My daughter has worn a patch with glasses the last two years. I bought this and similar books to link her situation with others via storybooks. The story was fairly uninteresting. Worth a read once through i suppose. Would recommend getting it from the library or second hand.
4,When life gives you lemons.....use your imagination!,"A trip to the pediatrician's office for a checkup reveals that 5 yr. old Becca has a 'lazy eye' and needs to wear a patch and glasses for a while. Becca protests saying that ""Ballerinas don't wear glasses and do NOT wear patches!"" Becca goes to school in her brother's pirate costume to conceal the real reason for having to wear a patch and glasses. She then tries convincing her friends that she's a private eye, and then a one eyed monster. Her classmates see how fun it is to wear an eye patch and they all decide they want one too. Which is, I think the main point of the book. -To show kids that having a minor medical condition isn't a big scary deal and if they use their imaginations and make the best and most fun of it, others won't think it's such a big deal either.We enjoyed reading this with our daughter. She liked the story and the pictures. There's an author's note at the very back of the book about the condition 'amblyopia'(lazy eye)."
2,Not a helpful message,"Wearing an eye patch does not make one look like a pirate. My five-year-old has been wearing glasses for two years and patching for one year. I shield her from anything that suggests she looks funny, ugly, silly, or strange in glasses or an eye patch. She doesn't have to pretend to be a pirate to pull off wearing an eye patch. My ideal book about glasses or an eye patch would be a book about a great kid, and the glasses or patch would never be mentioned at all."
4,"funny, relaxing book :)",I enjoyed this book very much. It was funny and I loved all of the stories! My favorite story is the first one where the main character and 'his' horse (the horse forced him to buy him) both find 'girlfriends'... but the horse 'breaks up' with his 'girlfriend' and makes his 'owner' miserable. So funny! It's not the BEST book I've read though. But I'm only rating it a 4 star because I'm picky about this type of thing. Loved this book though!
5,Thank you for this wonderful gift!,"I was first attracted to the book because the title was so tongue-in-cheek. Turned out, so was the book! Looking for and finding God (if you're lucky) can be a heavy task, but in Marie D. Jones' brilliant book, it is treated in more of a light vein. With chapter titles like ""Do You Validate?,"" ""Might as Well Face It, You're Addicted to ___________,"" and ""Catechism Cataclysm,"" I was able to laugh at myself and others as we take many wrong turns in our life's journey. The book led me to People, Places, and Things where I and others have looked for and not found God or Spirit or Peace. When I finally arrived at ""Where to Find God,"" it all seemed so simple, so obvious. Yet so elusive at the same time. It made me remember how important it is to take ""time outs"" during my hectic days to sit in the silence, rub my cat's belly, take three deep breaths, and know that God is everywhere and God is right here where I am. Thank you Marie, for this wonderful gift!"
4,Enlightening and enjoyable read,"I hate books that get so detailed and research-heavy your head spins just reading them. I really enjoyed this book, and felt it was just right for someone who hates having to look at footnotes for every other paragraph. A fun and deep at the same time book..."
5,"Fun and enlightening, especially in these greed-driven times","A great book for anybody who has ever looked for spiritual empowerment in things like money, success, beauty, people, drugs, fame...I love the humor and personal essay-style, which makes the information more accessable and easy to relate to. I hate heavy-handed and preachy books on spirituality, so this was really perfect for me. Reminds me a lot of ""Traveling Mercies,"" and other narrative books that combine humor and serious insight."
4,Does the job.,I used it to go over my clothes when it rains. I definitely keeps me dry. It will also keep you hot as it holds heat in. I got large size but it's more like XXL which is okay since I use it only to go over my gear when it rains. I fold it and keep in my sidebag all the time just in case and the pants and jacket together take up very little space when folded. These items offer no protection whatsoever btw. The jacket does have a stretch band around the waist area which keeps it snug and help it stay down so water does not enter. Overall great for the price.
3,Rain Gear,"I ended up using the pants more often, the jacket's zipper broke on me after just a few uses since it's made of plastic for whatever reason. Don't roll up the pants into storage or it'll eat away the material somehow. Still keeps you dry though, just have to reinvest if you have to use it often."
5,amazing underground band,I heard about this band from a friend in Virginia so i bought the EP. It was so awesome. I like listening to lesser known bands and this band is great. I can't wait to see them live.
1,Be warned! Rust stains on your counter!,"I normally don't take the time to write reviews but buyer beware of this product. First I hate the smell, not like eucalyptus at all. It smells like cheap bath soap, very perfume-y, we all know what that smells like! Anyways I could live with that, I did buy it online....But after just a few weeks of using it I noticed a rust stain on my newly remodeled counter tops. FYI-Rust stains do not come out. And guess what? The maker of this product is not going to come and fix your counters. Do not buy this product unless you do not want to use the metal caddy."
1,Smells horrible!,It reminds me of really cheap hotel soap. It dries out your skin. The smell is completely overwhelming and sort of makes you feel allergic. Does not smell like eucalyptus. Surprised Thymes would have made and approved this scent for mass release. GROSS!!!
1,Forget buying this tumbler,"I have tried again and again to get the Urban Tumbler to work but to no avail. I live in the western suburbs of Chicago and all I get out of this composter is goo. After trying more ""brown"" nothing happens even when I wet down the contents. It sits in the sun all summer ""cooking"" goop! Sorry I have to be so negative!"
1,Cockroach infestations make for bad neighbors,"I used a different type of composter when I had a much larger yard and it worked well, but it eventually attracted rats. In my new smaller yard, I was hoping that this enclosed model would compost quickly and relatively easily and discourage pests. Granted, I haven't seen rats, but the compost is crawling with cockroaches. There are some minor things that you can do to try and discourage roaches - keep compost damp, turn regularly, etc, but none of them are completely effective, and I really hate being the person infesting our urban neighborhood with cockroaches. I'm afraid it just doesn't seem practical and considerate to compost when houses are so close together. What a bummer."
3,Ripe Fruit,This erotica was just ok. I was expecting more stories of well-seasoned lovers of the opposite sex not same sex stories. There are some good one's in the book but not enough to really call this book great. I was disappointed.
5,Great puzzle,"My son is going to love this , it arrived quickly and is exactly what I expected. I would recommend this for all ages"
3,"Good product, but miss one piece","I bought this one for my daughter about one year ago, but just unpacked it yesterday. It is very good product, but miss one piece:("
5,He loved it!,I bought this for my 4 year old grandson and he loved it! Of course all little boys love dinosaurs but we make up stories as we put it together and he wants to do this puzzle every time he comes over!
5,"Challenging, but lots of fun","My son got this puzzle when he was three. He absolutely loved it and still does at four. It wasn't quite as easy as many of the floor puzzles, which usually have simpler pictures (stylistically). I think that's part of why he liked it. The first time he put it together took him about 20 minutes of concentrated 'work'. After that, he was able to put it together in about 2 mintues, but loves to stomp around it and pretend that he is one of the dinosaurs in the puzzle.This has been a great one. Lots of fun and very, very durable (it goes together probably every other day around here). I highly recommend it."
3,Where are the dinosaur names?,"My 3 year old loves puzzles and dinosaurs, and he enjoys this puzzle. The colors are good, the pictures realistic, and it is durable (as I expect from Melissa and Doug products). My complaint is that there is no information about which dinosaurs are pictured. I am no expert, and my son keeps asking what their names are. We've been able to figure some out by looking through books, but it is work I don't think I should have to do. If it had this information (or if you don't care about this info), I would give it 5 stars. The Crocodile Creek dinosaur puzzle has a cartoonish look, but at least it includes the names and eliminates this hassle."
4,Dinosaur Floor Puzzle,The kids loved this product and enjoyed the excitement of putting it together.
5,Received as a gift for a 4 year old,"My 4 year old daughter received this as a gift--Was impressed with the quality of the product, colors an images were nice, puzzle seems very durable. Would buy more of this type product and would recommend it to others."
4,dinosaur puzzle,"Great puzzle for kids to learn spacial orientation. With some help the first couple of times, kids(4-5) should be able to do on their own."
4,Pretty good puzzle,I was hoping this would be a little more durable than it was but my 4 yr old loved it. It hasn't torn yet but I have seen sturdier puzzles that lock together well.
4,Good puzzle but not for suggested ages,"I gave this puzzle to my granddaughter for Christmas, who was 2 at the time and she had it assembled in less than 15 min. The puzzle itself is colorful and sturdy but the recommended ages are off ""From Amazon: Our recommended age: 36 months - 6 years Manufacturer recommended age: 3 years and up"". I am now looking for Melissa & Doug puzzles that are more advanced."
1,$1600 for 3 years of usage,"Loved this TV until it started malfunctioning and finally quit working just after the warranty expired. We purchased the the extended warranty from Best Buy and they came out once but couldn't recreate the problem. When it finally quit, it was just two weeks after the extended Best Buy warranty expired. The set is now defunct, spent $199 so far for a local technician to tell us it may be able to be repaired for a minimum of $500. Toshiba and Best Buy refused to do anything to help even though we had reported the problem during the warranty period."
2,$1699 for 4 years of usage,"Loved this TV until it broke just after the warranty expired. Made a mistake and purchased the extended warranty from Best Buy which ran concurrent with the factory warranty so I was shorted a year of warranty. Had I purchased the Toshiba factory warranty after getting home, the set would still be under warranty. The set is now defunct, spent $350 thus far to repair vertical problem and now technician claims he can't find a needed tube for additional cost. Probably will trash the set."
1,VERY bad customer service,"Had no problems with this unit until i HAD a problem.I bought mine 1/16/02 & have been pleased with the performance till early in December when the screen went black and liquid started spilling out the bottom !!!! It has been setting in my living room for 6 weeks now ( black screen, liquid dripping etc).Atechnician came by about a month ago, charged me $63 & said he could fix it but could not warranty his work.Long story short; I've been getting the runaround for over a month now since it became apparent that the unit needs to be replaced. Looks like i'll have to rely on small claims court to get Toshiba to honor the warranty. BEWARE"
1,I TOOK IT BACK,"I bought a new TOSHIBA 43H71 took it home and hooked it up and I was gravely disappointed with the picture quality. I could not get channel 5 with a clear image, it had snow all over the screen, I even bought a new antenna, but that still did not clear up the picture. I did not like the fact that you had to seat directly in front of the TV to see a good picture, plus I did not like the fact that this TV had about 30 or more settings you had to make. Every time I turned the set off and then back on, you had to make some more settings. I took it back to the store I bought it from for a refund, then I went to another store and bought a new SONY 36"" WEGA Trinitron and I have been happy every since."
5,My favorite Childhood book,"This is the only book I truly remember from my childhood. It is very difficult to find, so I recommend that you purchase whatever condition you can locate. It has charming illustrations in it, as well as a wildly imaginative plot line. The vacuum and the penny illustration was one I remembered very vividly. So often in life, upturned noses and superficial conceits can be so destructive to another's self image. This little doll's tale exemplifies the special worth of each and every person, even if she is a small doll!"
2,This is NOT Lifehouse!,"Fans of the band Lifehouse are aware that they were formerly known as Blyss, with that spelling. The CD RealSimpleFeelGood is by another band from Oregon with the same name, same spelling.Reviewed independently of the false Lifehouse connection, the Oregon Blyss is an OK band, difficult to distinguish from their peers."
2,Two years and nothing new.,"This is pretty much the same album the band released a couple of years ago on a different label. A couple of new songs which are not very good. A couple of remixes to songs that should of been left alone because the previous mixes were better. It is obvious that Sire records is trying to break the band on the last album which saved them money in the long run but I feel has hurt the band with their already established fan base. It also makes me wonder if the band has any really good new songs. By evidence of the new songs such as ""Do It"" it doesn't sound like they do. I find this extremely disappointing because I really loved the last one, I just found nothing new on this one that would make me pick up the next. From a band point of view, How they could let old songs get re-released as a new album I find shameful, because you owe it to yourself as an artist to continue to grow. What's next guys a greatest hits package!"
5,bella vera!,"This recently released cd is a lot of fun, especially the video tracks ""bella vera (non e il caldo ma)"" and ""la lungha estate caldissima"". But these songs don't give the flavor of the whole album which is surprisingly varied. Romantic songs, like ""Essere in te"" and ""Honolulu Baby"" are well executed and beautifully sung. ""Cloro"" is an upbeat, strange song that sticks in the head but is uniquely flavorful. The title song's instrumentals are unique. It is a cd you'll listen to over and over again. The videos are delightfully cheesy, exactly what you expect from italian pop!"
2,Led Zeppelin Deserves Better Than This,"I bought this book with the anticipation of learning all sorts of obscure Led Zeppelin trivia. I was also looking forward to finding out what inspired these guys to write some of the most memorable songs ever. I was dissappointed in both aspects.To be quite frank, this book just isn't long enough. If you've never even heard of Led Zeppelin before its a pretty good start, but it reads like the instructions for operating a VCR.There are a lot of good photographs in the book but the author or editor didn't even bother to put the album cover on the first page of the chapter about each album.If you're really looking for more on the greatest rock band of all time, look somewhere else. Most Zeppelin fans will find this book lacking."
2,Don't buy this book,"I was very disappointed with this book. First, it doesn't contain much new information - the stories behind the songs are pretty general, and not interviews of Led Zeppelin. Secondly, the author says negative stuff about the music. For example: ""There never was a real ending to 'Whole Lotta Love' and maybe it should have finished a chorus earlier than the final fade-out."" Then on ""Hey Hey What Can I Do"" he says ""It fades out in some chaos, which might suggest it was a trial run for a song weeded out of the final album-selection process"". Thankfully Led Zepp didn't listen to people like this guy when they made their recordings."
3,Mediocre,"Tends to ""describe"" or give his opinion about the songs rather than telling the story behind them. I can listen to the songs - I don't need to be told how great they are or how Plant's voice sounds on a particular number.A disappointment."
2,It all depends...,"I was highly excited when i bought this book. I am a very obsessed Led Zeppelin fan and was looking forward to reading it after listening endlessly to all of their songs. If you are just starting with Zeppelin its a great book to read, but if you a huge long time fan, than i dont recommend that you buy it. I already knew most of the stuff they said and the author lacks in explaining the actual meaning of the songs. The 'analysis' is too short. Ramble On only has one paragraph!! I was disappointed...the author is telling me some lyrics and some instruments that are used..its purely not enough..you can learn more by going on the message boards at www.Led-Zeppelin.com..and trust me i have..."
5,Awesome photos and unique insights into their music.,A stunning book as much for the pic material as for the text content. Chris Welch knows this group and obviously isn't jaded by his back-stage association with them. Led Zeppelin are icons and Chris Welch goes a long way to explain why. Especially appreciated by me are the glorious full page photos of John Bonham; for some reason usually absent from most other books. Well done.
5,LED ZEPPELIN FOREVER,PLEASE IGNORE ALL THE ONE STAR REVIEWS FOR THIS GREAT BOOK ON THE GREATEST ROCK BAND EVER.THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING READ ON THIS CLASSIC BAND AND IS VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.FIVE STARS
5,Led Zeppelin,"Led Zeppelin Dazed And Confused is a great guide to Led Zeppelin's songs. Its has all the stories behind the songs!It also has great pictures of Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, John Boham, and John Paul Jones on mainly every page! I think this book will appeal to all Led Zeppelin fans!"
4,Snake Eyes,"If you like old school ""Hamond"" organ jazz playing with a great supporting band you'll like this one."
1,Beware - Not all the same book.,"Amazon has confused several different items. They have attached the ""Editorial reviews"" for a hardcover book of the Brothers Grimm's Snow White and Rose Red illustrated by Gennady Spirin and published by Philomel to a School & Library book illustrated by James Weren with cartoon-style illustrations and an adudio cassette, both published by Troll Associates. Other versions of this classic fairy tale with different illustrators have their own separate reviews as these completely different items should. When dealing with children's picture books, different illustrators create entirely different books. All the Spirin and Werren versions share is a title."
4,"Old School Story, Still Popular","This is a story I remembered loving as a child. It is not as politically correct as today's children's literature -- a troll displays all kinds of rude behavior and then is killed at the end by a ""Bear"". My girls (3 and 6) gave this book and all its elements lots of thought and it prompted considerable discussion. In the end, however, the story illustrates great love between two sisters which has made this one of my girls' favorites as well."
4,Cute old fairy tale,"Cute old fairy tale. Sweet story of how two sweet gracious girls rescued from poverty by their Prince. What can you do? That is the premise of most fairy tales. What I found fun is it came with a little record. Of course we don't have a record player but it brought back memories of when I was little. In the end sweet little story, my daughter loved it. Worth the price."
4,"4 stars for the album, 4 for the dvd.","I was on my fifth Sting-consert in Oslo Spectrum (Norway) yesterday, yes - I am a Sting-fan, and the show was great!I bought myself a signed copy of his book ""Broken Music"", and I am of course very happy. The only ""downer"" yesterday was that he opened the show with the techno-version of ""Send your Love""(!) - but other than that he and his great band performed in the same old genioustic style, musicians of the highest level.I have written a review of the album ""Sacred Love"" already, so this is for the bonus-dvd of this release.Done mainly for the money? Absolutely. But it is fun for the fans, and the ""show"" is entertaining - and is closed with a beautiful version of the wonderful Fields of Gold. Five songs performed live in something that looks like a tv-show (?) for promotion of the album. If you are a collector, don't hesitate to buy a copy of it."
4,Does the Job With Some Attitude,"Nice mirror for adding some style while staying safe and keeping track of what approaches from behind. Not extremely high quality but well worth the cost. One item to note, most buyers will get this, but just in case, there is a plastic protective coating on the mirror surface that must be carefully peeled off before using. If you do not realize it is there you may think the item is unusable."
5,"Quiet novel with themes of fidelity, betrayal, death","I have read other books by Louise Dean and so was tempted to try this one. Very engrossing. The plot line concerns two couples, middle aged at least, one British and one Belgian, who don't know each other but meet at a luxury vacation spot in the Caribbean. (For both couples the trip is a gift from their adult children). The main character, Jan, is dying of cancer, and this is supposed to be his last big vacation but the long-term strains in his marriage keep bubbling up. The other couple, older, also have deep issues. In the hothouse environment of a resort spa, others are pulled into this dance, each with their own baggage. I found it to be quite engrossing and recommend it (even though the ending fizzled a bit from my point of view). Come on, Ms. Dean, give us a more powerful ending!!"
4,Interesting and provocative read,"Had to wonder if the author was German or Danish, because the writing style is awkward and thought the novel was a translation or maybe she was knackered when pounding away on the machine with an extreme overuse of the thesaurus. In disbelief that the author hails from the UK.If the book was cleaned up a bit, it would be much better. The social issues dealing with death, difficulties of marriage, loss of youth, alzheimers etc. are important and should be applauded for highlighting what most people find not worth discussing/delving into at length."
2,"Do yourself a favor and skip this one, there are too many good books out there...","Thankfully I only spent $5 on this and little time. This is just one of the worst books I have read in a while. The characters are not developed, the story is slow and mundane, and I dislike how the English (the author lives in London) structures and organizes the written language - it just seems odd. The English phrases are just 'off' to me. There are spelling disparities and punctuation issues too. As someone else said, it almost seems as though some things were 'lost in translation'. I also was not surprised to see one of the five 5 star reviews was from someone in London. Bottom line is, there are just too many good books out there to waste time on this one..."
2,"This book is a wasted opportunity, like the lives it attempts to depict","I'm giving this book a generous rating of 2 stars because I did read it at one sitting. But I read it at one sitting because I saw a lot of potential to discuss the issues at hand - the examination of your motivations, relationships, wasted opportunities, etc. when you're coming to the end of life's road. But the discussion was trivial and ultimately didn't work because Ms. Dean gave us characters who, after 304 pages, I didn't really know or care about."
1,Falls apart very quickly,"This is a cute puzzle, but unfortunately, the pieces are falling apart quickly. When it says 'solid wood', each piece is really several very thin layers of wood glued together. When assembled, the pieces fit very tightly together so that just separating them is enough to delaminate the layers, especially the top layer which has the paper picture glued to it. This started happening the first few times we played with it."
5,I love old maps!,"This one is a nice addition to the research I've been doing on my uncle's Army unit in World War II. I'm lucky to have the letters he wrote to his family from the time he was inducted to a few weeks before he was killed in France. I've marked the command posts on Google Earth, but there's something about an old paper map from that era that makes it seem more authentic.I've also ordered the Battle of Normandy, Map 102."
1,Worst possible Deep Purple CD,"Give them credit, the liner notes say what the band was up against during this concert - a half paralyzed Tommy Bolin due to drugs. But this is...that should never have been released. John Lord does a very boring solo, Glenn Hughes voice repeatedly cracks, there's virtually no guitar player, and no matter how good they are here - David Coverdale, Ian Paice and Jon Lord just can't carry the show. I never bought a CD that I genuinely felt ... before this one. Very sad..."
5,the new remixed of last concert in japan 1977,"yes this cd is absolutely excellent, many people said that the LCIJ LP from 1977 was crap, but this new remixed from songs like burn until mayhem highway star showing us that deep purple mk IV was a very exciting line up.Long time ago, the Last concert LP 1977 got a very bad mixed and the errors on the lp version. Today Purple records in UK have decided to release the old Lp again on the double cd set. The songs here are completely presented.....A must for all deep purple fans like me! 18 songs on 2 cd!! how pretty it is!"
2,Don't go there,"I had high hopes for this album. I had enjoyed Tommy Bolin's studio albums and I thought Coverdale and Hughes sounded great when I saw them in California Jam on TV 30 years ago. But the performances here are awful! These singers have both made some excellent recordings but in this concert they just had nothing. Coverdale was flat but Hughes manages to do little but offer up frequent and useless screams. They sound wasted.The liner notes document Bolin's hand problems during this tour and that may explain his subpar performance. Some of his solos just lay there as if he was expecting Jon Lord to fill in everywhere. Lord and Paice both play great and the remastering is excellent, but its not enough. This was a concert best left forgotten."
4,"if you like Coldplay, you won&#65533;t like Deep Purple","The remastered version of Last Concert in Japan 1975 which had been rushed out quickly as a single EMI released - LP in 1977. this double CD set includes some unreleased songs that weren?t involved in the old vinyl release. Tommy Bolin?s guitar playing is amazing and he was on fire at night. Martin Birch the old time DP soundengineer had mixed up the LP very numb and avoided any guitar distortions what Bolin played. This double cd set reminds us as a small brother of the success of Made in Japan 1972.Musically DP have more nice composition. but Roger Glover doesn?t want DP to be a trend. he said we?ll never be a trend, we are not into pop celebs. we?re just a natural group. Glenn Hughes said the same thing that he is just only a natural singer, who composed the songs that had happened to his life.PS: Coldplay is a lovely band of many celebs but also the most detested band by the heavy rock fans....."
5,only fool rock fans said this one is a bad cd,"this cd is a double remix of the original LP who had appeared in warner bros Japan 1977.Long ago the original LP Last concert in japan was rushed out very quickly, and the Japanese record company put out the songs on the LP not correct. The set had an errors, and many good songs such as lazy, Stormbringer, This time around and owed to G also Drifter were hacked.This new double remixed cd is now presenting the whole Deep purple mk IV set from the beginning until finish.You can checkt out from a thundering Burn until the great anthem Highway star. And Deep purple featuring Tommy Bolin on guitar was not a weak line up. This previous line up was short, but the legendary is still alive."
3,This book had too many flaws,"This book had a good plot and even though it ended bad, it was still a nice book, but there were a couple things that made the events in it impossible. First, if Billy was a vampire, when he dragged April into the sunlight, it would have killed him too. And what about his parents? Wouldn't they have guessed something if he was in a coffin during the day!!! And he went out to eat with his friends, they would have thought something was wrong if he never ate!"
2,This is not the Joan Baez we love so dearly.,"My wife and I bought our first Joan Baez album in the 60s, and have since bought every album she has ever released. We have also seen her live in concert several times. With two exceptions, ""Blowin' Away"" and ""Play Me Backwards,"" we cherish every one of her albums -- and enjoy them to this day. But ""Gone From Danger"" is simply not Joan Baez. Indeed, we don't know what it is. This is not to say that there is anything wrong with any artist venturing into new styles or materials -- or crossing over entirely, for that matter. Redeemed only by the few cuts on the bonus 2nd CD -- which emphatically prove that Joan is still Joan and account for the two stars, this collection is otherwise, and sadly, a failure -- simply because this is not the Joan Baez we love so dearly. (And echo and over-dubbing? Really!!) Please come back, Joan. Please."
5,red leaves,"Reading a Thomas Cook novel is like taking a journey into darkness...But if your willing to take the trip, you will find that you have learned something about yourself along the way.Again, Thomas Cook takes the mystery novel to a whole new level.He is the best at what he does."
4,Still a riveting read despite plot hole.,"I too was extremely bothered by the plot hole that Mr, Baker pointed out: how could neither parent check on their daughter when they got home that night? Thomas H. Cook is one of my favorite writers, so I thought for sure he would provide an explanation or at least acknowledge the parent's oversight or maybe suggest that a pillow was placed in the girl's bed to fool them or SOMETHING! So, yeah, this was a real flaw in the storyline... well, maybe one of two: the detectives were really unbelievably stupid not to ""sniff"" around for another possible suspect. That said, I can only deduct one star for an otherwise riveting read. Cook's books generally transcend the mystery genre, and like so many of his others, ""Red Leaves"" is mostly about the characters and that's what held my interest."
2,Not the Worst Book I've Ever Read...,"...but certainly not one I'd recommend. Just trudged along with not much to offer. Didn't find too many sympathetic characters, and the end was predictable. The only redeeming factor was that it wasn't a long book. Wish I would've enjoyed it, but simply finished it to satisfy my book club requirement!"
2,Wake me up when the game's over...,"Who said this was scary? Must've been a real whoosie... The game is awkward in it's controls and it's annoying trying to recharge. The graphics are good, but scary? C'mon... If you think this is scary you must've led a sheltered life... I love exciting games and this one bored me... I wouldn't reccommend it to anyone who has a short attention span..."
5,"HARD, BUT FUN","This game is about 5 levels, but they are WICKED hard. NOthing more to say. go out and buy this game. Play with cheats if u get bored, taht will keep u going for a couple more weeks."
4,Resident Evil 3 was awesome.,"Flesh eating zombies, plagued creatures and vicious animals. You want a game that will scare the pants off of you...well here it is. Resident evil 3 is the best resident evil(for playstation 1 and computer). What i loved about this game was that it made you think what you had to do. For example, you either have the choice of doing something that will help save your life or help you kill the monster. Also you have to think like..""What am i gonna do next?"", ""Where do i go?"", or ""Should i take this weapon or should i save room for something i might need?"". What i didn't like was the graphics. They weren't really what i had expected. I mean it would have been a little better if the mouths moved and u can see there faces a little better. If only it had a little more detail, but all in all it was a great game. If you want suspense, creepy music, and blood thirsty monsters to blow away, then this is your game."
4,The best selling game on earth,"I wasn't much surprised to play the first of the resident evil game, simply because of the graphics... The second one was a great achievement, and the third one is simply the best of all the games. The graphics were simply superb and the suspence kept me glued to my computer... In this part we get to see Jill Valentine again, striving hard to save her life from flesh eating zombies and she plans it with the help of mikhial victor, a member of UBCS.. they plan to reach the clock tower via the L train but the seemingly unstopable monster plagues her constant struggle for survival...Now this seems quite prosaic but actually this holds all the gem for the game freaks and specially for the resident evil fans...go for it!!!"
4,The Scariest Game for the Playstation!!!!!,"This has got to be the scariest game I have ever played! I have let go over the controller some many times I can't even count them. The controlls are a little hard to master but if you have ever played the first or second one it will be easy. The graphics are ok, especially when the movies appear, and the plot is alright. The majior plot is to escape from this little town but when you do the zombies attack. There is this one huge ""bad zombie"" who chases you all around, Nemisis. He is really scary and you can run into him at any point during the game, except for the first ten minutes! There is a lot of scary moments and I wouldn't recomend this game for small kids. It is really hard, scary, but very very fun."
1,Absolutely atrocious,"Note: This review is for the Audiobook version.The Audiobook is a tragedy of ... everything. At first, I appreciated that the reader attempted to give a different voice to each character. Although, the first two speaking characters were draconians, and after 7 minutes of scratchy, guttural, and ssssssnakey dialogue, I was fairly annoyed. It really made me appreciate the reader for Dragons of Autumn Twilight.But when she got to Tasslehoff, I had to stop. The reader's interpretation and presentation was quite cartoonish and ... I couldn't help but imagine a retarded gully dwarf clown."
2,Sloppy Effort,"I was eager to read this because like many I am entranced by the Dragonlance Universe, and I enjoyed the brief glimpse of backstory- I feel like this might have been intended or at the least contemplated 26 years ago when the first novel was published, because I was always puzzled/ frustrated by the gaps in storyline.Unfortunately the stilted writing, grammatical errors and shallow overview of the emotional depths of the characters ruined the story line for me. It was as if the entire story was dictated to a text to speech and sent off to be published without any effort at... well anything really.Perhaps the most poignant thing I can say about it is I read this three months ago, and despite a strong hunger to know what happens in the other two in this trilogy, I haven't been able to bring myself to buy Dragons of a Highlord Sky."
5,Dragonlance standard!,"This book lives up to the Dragonlance standard in my opinion. It portrays the events that took place between the first two book of the chronicles trilogy (after the escape for Pax Tharkas).Definetly worth reading if you crave to know what convinced the dwarfs of Thorbadin to shelter 800 human refugees, or if you crave to know how a hammer that has been lost for over 300 years finally resurfaced."
4,"Wow, Another Great Instalment","This is another great Dragon Chronicles novel which certainly explains some of the inbetween material we did not see in the origional Trilogy. Excellently written, always witty, and the characters are exactly like they were in the first three books. Excellent novel and highly recommended."
3,Slow Going,"I'm trying to read Dragons of Dwarven depths but so far I'm quite bored. It does read like an old tabletop d&d; game with some of the most average dialog I've ever read. Tanis calls the high theocrat an a**. The kender makes unfunny jokes about chickens. Repeatedly. Seriously, if I had something else to read I'd be doing so. There are too many characters making their requisite cameos and not enough action. I loved these books when I was a teen. But I never realized quite how stereotyped many of these characters are. If I have to hear about how how gold and lovely Laurana and Goldmoon's hair is, I think I will scream. Bleck.I hopefully will persevere and resurrect some of the thrill I had from the initial series...But so far, I'm living for scenes with Caramon and Raist and slogging through the boring face time with less interesting characters. Meh. 3 stars. Average."
3,Good Read,"I haven't read a Weis and Hickman Dragonlance novel that I liked since the Legends trilogy way back when. This one drew me in, kept me on the edge of my seat, and definitely reminded me of the glory days of ""Chronicles"" and ""Legends."" I give this book 3 1/2 out of 5 stars. In the fast-paced action leading up to the climax, I think the authors cut come corners of logic to make all of the pieces fit together nicely. Namely, when the heroes were prisoners, they were left hardly guarded and allowed to roam freely when they escaped! Also, while collectively the heroes had a major impact, individually, I would have liked to see greater individual impact. There were also quite a few misspellings, which I would not expect from this publisher. But, with that aside, this was certainly a good read, and wonderful story, and adds to the depth of the characters. I highly recommend it and eagerly look forward to the next story in the series."
2,Was the Editor on Vacation!?,"The number of spelling mistakes, typos, and grammatical errors in this book is off the charts. Literally, there is a glaring mistake every other page. For a major publishing house, WoC, this is unforgivable. For two authors who have been in the business for over 20 years, this is unforgivable.Not to mention that Weis and Hickman have lost the ""essence"" of each of their characters. Raistlin and the crew are just cardboard cutouts of their former selves.It's an easy read, and it does have its moments, so if you miss the world of Krynn, I suppose you could do worse."
5,"Dead villains, beloved heroes and a lost hammer. What's not to like?","This book is an excellent addition to the Dragonlance Saga. It's nearly seamless with the other books, Dragons of Autumn Twilight and Dragons of Winter Night, and could theoretically be read in between them with no continuity problems to the reader. However, there are lots of hints to the Legends trilogy (Fistandantilus, The Abyss, Dougan Redhammer) that those who have already read these series can appreciate the little drop ins. It's always good to see the Companions at work again, though, as always, Raistlin, Flint and Tasselhoff steal the show. The other characters are there, but mostly in a minor role, especially Laurana, Goldmoon and Elistan. Though with a title of ""Dwarven Depths"", it's no wonder that Flint takes center stage.All in all, a great book and I can't wait to see the next in a year!"
3,"A good read, but does not compare...","I was excited to finally get this book although the first part of the book dragged endlessly. Although I am an avid Dragonlance reader, the characters of old had a different ""feel"" about them, not like their old selves. That was the hardest thing to digest in the book. The tale is getting better and there are a few things that contradict the earlier books but you learn to ignore them and read on."
3,Love the series but...,"I truly love the series and these characters... however, a lot of the dialog between characters in this book felt forced or ""over-acted"" to me, compared to the subtle, easy feel of the other books with these characters I've read. Also, a LOT of time was spent explaining the characters, and re-hashing old ground. Second book in this series was much better"
4,All Hail Flint Fireforge,I read a lot of the series back in the 80's Great job filling in the blanks of a great adventure. This book is best read during (if you know where to skip over) or after The Dragonlance Chronicles Trilogy. It was fun reading and It reminded me just how much a missed Flint and Tas.
3,Little disappointed,Having read many of the dragonlance series when I was younger I was really looking forward to reading this however I thought the writing was a little confused at times and I didn't really care for how the characters were portrayed. The next book Highlord Skies has been much better.
3,Interesting Addition,New angle; a few interesting bits...The tricky bit is matching all events to the future..I enjoyed reading it... and definitely don't regret buying it...
4,Nostalgic and enjoyable,It was nice to read about the old crew in a new writing. I look forward to the next release; hopefully soon.
4,Stuffy albums renewed,"The Baltimore album appliqué style is among the most rigidly traditional of all. What makes a Baltimore album - the elaborate fruit and flower appliqué patterns - doesn't allow for much creativity of design for the quilter. Or does it? Jane Townswick undertakes in her new book to show how quilters can put new wine in old bottles by ringing changes on traditional album blocks. Starting with a significant example of the style, an 1857 quilt from New York state belonging to the State Historical Association, Townswick shows the reader how to update and vary the traditional blocks in the quilt for a fresh and contemporary look that still is clearly in the Baltimore tradition. Townswick also uses fabric selection to update her look, and the effects of including Skydyes and other contemporary fabrics are refreshing and new. The book is full of tricks and techniques for easier appliqué. If you think Baltimore albums tend to be a bit stuffy, this book is a good antidote!"
5,The VOICE is what is heavenly here!,"Tammy Wynette recorded the majority of these songs at the same time she was recording STAND BY YOUR MAN. While the songs are traditional classics of inspiration, it is the powerful and youthful voice of country music's First Lady that takes your breath away here. Wynette and producer Billy Sherrill were still mapping Wynette's one-of-kind voice to specific types of songs which would emphasize her abilities and this collection is an example of their best."
1,How much does it hold?,"Can't believe these people left off the size of this thing. The concept is intriguing -- 2 bins are VERY attractive. But I MUST know the size or will never, ever order it. ZEROS to you."
1,Prank,I loved this book because it was funny and the pranks were good! I recommend this book to any one. :)
2,Not enough support,"These stockings say they have 14% lycra, which should provide mild support. In fact, they provide almost none, even at the ankle area. Guess you get what you pay for!"
5,panty hose,Fits and supports a tall lady very well. It comes in the required colors that are needed by most ladies.
1,1 Star because I dont like Taliban of any religon.,They are just Mullahs in black hats and Zionism is the West under a different name.
1,The 2 reviews above are from the film's producer and boyfriend,"As any regular reader of the Indymedia sites is aware, ""Truthseeker"" is simply a pseudonym for the filmmaker Wendy Campbell (the canned and predictable rhetoric of this review makes that clear as well). She is simply posing here as a disinterested consumer while in fact praising her own work. Mark P. Green is her boyfriend and one-time fiance. They live together in La Quinta, California. Apparently they could not find anyone outside their circle to review and praise this film (now they'll probably send one of their friends to rebut this)."
4,contrarian perspective,"Mainstream ""news"" about Israel and Zionism generally gets a kosher stamp of approval, particularly when the source is Jewish. Fortunately, some iconoclastic Jews are leading the way towards openly and fairly criticizing Israel as it was created, and cautioning us about America's continued ""special relationship"" with the Jewish State.Rabbi Weiss sets an example for us all. It's time to re-think an alliance which has undermined American values along with our national reputation."
4,Lake Wobegon Loyaly Days,"This record by Garrison Keillor is both subtle and also hilarious. The anthem of the Sons of Knute stands out as a comic masterpiece. It is closely follwed in quality by the tale of the Radio Announcer which incorporates Garrison Keillor's brand of quiet desperation with comic genius. The record audience is clearly Keillor addicts and completely in his thrall, as the listener soon is too.One can play this record over and over and still find new subleties in its construction. This is a rare American comic genius who can pull quiet fun at America in the kindest way."
3,"Good, but.....","Not bad. It does its job.Pros: holds two gauges, fits well.Cons: two ugly fasteners instead of stock retaining pins, hole for defroster is poorly dimensioned.With the amount of thought the manufacturer put into the mounting system, they could've easily duplicated the Ford method of the plastic tabs on the back of the unit. It would've looked so much better and would've held better too. Instead, they give us two ugly screws. Nice.Also, when tightened, the unit makes the defroster button look like something out of a lego set. The hole for the button is terribly off, rubbing up against one side of the button. It still works, but it definitely looks like @ss.And the headlight knob is no longer flush against the bezel.The only good thing about this piece is that is houses two gauages, and it doesn't make any creaking noises when going over bumbs.OVERALL: 3/5Better luck next time. :|"
3,No big deal,"I'm giving this item a 3 rating because I think it's just okay. Overpriced and overrated. On the other hand, my husband loves it. I just couldn't seem to get the right rocking motion needed to make it work well.The other thing that really bothers me is that there is no protective cover for the blade, and they are very large and sharp!"
2,"Pretty, but...","I saw this and just had to have it. I love the color and the cutting board is of good quality. The blades are super sharp, so beware. After using the Froggy, I found I prefer cutting herbs and ect with a good chef knife. It is easier to control where the blade is going. I'm thinking of getting a traditional Mezzaluna with only one blade instead. It would be nice if this came with something to store the blades in. The plastic covers that it came with are easily cut through, and don't last. By storing it in a drawer, with no covers, the blades are sure to get dull quickly."
3,yes and no,"I both like, and dislike this product. It is very sharp, and it even cuts through raw potato like nothing. The problem is that unless you're starting with something very small, stuff gets caught between the blades and can be very difficult to get out without cutting yourself. I like it but I'm constantly afraid someone's going to get hurt while using it!"
3,"Good, But Not Complete","Contains all original recordings between 1962 - 64, each one making the top 40. Obviously, Vinton's career was not the same after the British Invasion, but he did chart more hits well into the early 80s, and this CD does not include them. So as far as early hits go, this is a great CD, but for a more complete picture of Vinton, you'll need more."
2,Not all original recordings?,"I know for sure that the version of Blue on Blue on here is not from the 60s. You can listen to it side-by-side with the original (try The Look of Love Bacharach box set) and the modern production on the track is overwhelmingly bad. The music sounds like bad Billy Ocean.I've Always Loved You is contemporary, and I think Are You Sincere might be too, as it doesn't sound like 1969. Finally, Your Old 45s is newer as well.The rest seem to be (as far as I can tell without originals to compare to) from the 60s and 70s, so that's good. However, I'm sure there are better produced, more complete collections out there."
5,Bobby Vinton's Greatest Hits,"I ordered this cd for one song, but enjoyed all of them. It was like going back to the 60's although some of them sounded like they were a little different than back in the 60's when originally released. Still very good."
2,Not worth it,"These, at least for me, did not fit correctly and felt very cheaply made. I would not recommend this I would look else where at another pair of goggles."
3,It is a good book but does needs for examples,"The book should have more examples per topic, one example is not enough for a difficult subject like Numerical Analysis. The book does not provide the answers for the exercises and students do not have a way to check if they are doing the exercises correctly."
4,DIVORCE HIS DIVORCE HERS,"A PRETTY GOOD MOVIE FOR LIZ AND BURTON FANS,,VERY EUROPEAN AND IS WORTH WATCHING"
1,boring,"I had read somewhere that this was a disaster on TV. Well, the review was correct. This is a very boring DVD. But I had to find out for myself, and I did."
3,FOR FANS ONLY...,"OK, I admit, I picked this movie up after the passing of the late, great one and only,Liz. And while I love most of Elizabeth's movies... this one fell flat for me. Slowmoving and all over the place at times. This one may be only for die-hard fans ofLiz & Dick. Just OK at best."
4,Interesting drama.,"If you're a fan of Burton and Taylor, be sure to catch this Made-for-television movie. It's an interesting examination of a crumbling marriage viewed from both sides. Some line deliveries are stilted but all of the performances are sound. The Roman setting is magical. Today, this is a film which could work as a cult-feature, a curiosity or a camp classic. Decide for yourself."
1,This DVD is a Rip Off,"Yeah it's cheap, but this DVD is only the SECOND HALF of the film. There is a menu that shows ""Part 1"" and ""Part 2"", but you must go to the final chapter of the second half and fast-forward to the end before it cycles to this HIDDEN menu. Only problem... no matter what button you push it starts the SECOND HALF. I began to suspect that there was nothing BUT the second half on the DVD and came to Amazon to make sure I had my facts straight. Sure enough; the ENTIRE film is 180 minutes long, and as you will note... this DVD is only 73 minutes long. Don't waste your time."
2,Divorce is ugly,"This is an old DVD released in 2001 with absolutely no specials, commentary, or even subtitles. The picture quality is fine for an old movie(from 1973). The DVD contains two parts(His/Her).The Divorce His part contains numerous flashback scenes from the husband's viewpoint. Before a flashback, Burton's character goes into a zone, then the flashback begins. I found the flashbacks to be disruptive, like someone cutting into a conversation.Divorce Hers(just like His) contains plenty of long, drawn-out(and overly dramatic) conversations. Liz Taylor's character spends plenty of time 'yelping' about her troubles.I came in with an open-mind and tried to enjoy this movie, but I got bored pretty quick. Everyone has their own opinion; I still think Liz Taylor looks beautiful in this movie(in an older sort of way). That was the only somewhat enjoyable part of this movie."
2,WARNING - Deceptive Marketing Rebate Practice from Edge Corp,"I recently bought an Edge Tech Corp DiskGo flash drive and have been satisfied with its performance so far.UNFORTUNATELY, the company itself leaves much to be desired. They market many of these drives and other products with a VERY RESTRICTIVE rebate program which requires the rebate to be postmarked within 10 days of INVOICE. They make no allowance for holidays (as happened to me over xmas & new years) and personal vacations. Discussions with Edge Corp's main marketing & sales manager fell on deaf ears, and messages to their VP were unreturned.Only buy this product if you can meet their restrictive, if not onerous rebate rules. Using the SuperSaver free shipping may put you out of the rebate window. I for one, will never buy another Edge product."
3,Problems with rebate,"I too am happy with the performances of my Edge DiskGo! products, but have had trouble receiving any rebates."
2,Alright,"Started reading but never finished, was not an attention grabber but its readable... I prefer more detsail and action. thanks"
4,When criminals took the power in Russia,"Ouspensky is known for his philosophical books and particularly for ""In Search of the Miraculous"", in which he wrote about the teaching of G. I. Gurdjieff 1915-1918 in Russia.This book is a criticism of the Bolschevik revolution. It was written in the midst of the happenings describing much of the madness while it was going on.The letters were smuggled to the recipient, A. R. Orage, the editor of the literary magazine ""The New Age"" in London. (Ouspensky had been reading the magazine and met Orage before travelling to India in his ""search for an esoteric school"" in around 1915 and met Orage also on his way back to Russia.The book has an excerpt from Bechhofer's ""In Denikin's Russia and the Caucasus, 1919-1920"" with Ouspensky's discovery in the harsh circumstances while warming the inner man with Vodka: ""In spite of centuries of consumption of Vodka there is nothing that goes better with it than salted cucumber""."
5,"Hightower, Pheasant Hunting",This is a great book about how to hunt and how to grow up in nostalgic times in the early years of the twentieth century. Thru these pages you hear about the difference between different types of upland bird hunting. The prose is excellent and gives me a warm feeling everytime I open my first edition copy of this great story.
5,How to truly serve others,"What a fabulous book on the beauty of serving from Joy Haney. All her books are filled with experience, teaching, and encouragement. Every christian (and especially christian women) should read her books. I have learned so much from her example."
4,Mannix season six,"Mannix was a fine 70s show, still strong in season six, thanks largely to the compelling performance by Mike Connors. Highly recommended!"
5,Great Shape!!,I received Mannix Sixth Season in a timely fashion and in great shape. I would definitely recommend this dvd to anyone!!
5,Don't Hesitate,Don't hesitate to buy this season. Every season that we have purchased has been great. There is always a lot of action with Mannix. You won't be sorry!
5,Still Good After All These Years,"Thoroughly enjoyed watching these episodes. Amazing what tidbits I remembered from my early teen years when I watched the series faithfully. I enjoyed them so much, I just ordered Season 5, and will probably order Seasons 7 & 8 when they are ready."
4,"Action, Action, & More Action!","""Mannix: The Sixth Season"" is a six-disc set containing 24 episodes from the show's 1972-1973 season. Starring Mike Connors as the title character, ""Mannix"" was one of the most violent detective shows of its time. It was also one of the longest-running. Joe Mannix, an L.A.-based private eye, was employed by a sophisticated detective firm called Intertect.Though the company had the latest scientific equipment, Mannix worked mostly by his own instincts and fists. The show was one of the first to adopt the big screen's penchant for car chases, elaborate brawls, and blazing guns, making it a popular favorite for eight seasons. During season six, Mannix takes on the mob, a missing heiress, and a deadly foe with an ax to grind."
5,Fantastic,"I've become a big fan of Neiko's impact tools after using this line of products. The price is a bit high for torx sockets, but considering the strength and quality of the product, it's a good deal. Other reviews were talking about snapping them.... I've put a fair bit of torque on my set with no issues at all, and I have a hard time imagining what it would take to round them off, let alone break them. I highly recommend them."
1,Junk,Broke first socket within secounds of opening package with 3/8 IR impact gun. Junk .Also bought 3/8 set and broke that one too
1,I got what I paid for.,"The T47 broke on initial use. I ordered this ""Neiko USA"" tool set for less than the expected price for a single ""MADE IN USA"" impact torx bit. I got what I paid for. Life is too short - I returned it & I'm searching for an American made set."
2,"not strong enough for 1/2"" drive","I bought the item because it was a impact set. I used the T50 3 times with an adapter for a 3/8 ratchet. The first time I used this item with a 1/2"" ratchet, The tip broke off. This set is strong enough to be used on 3/8 drive, But if you sell a item for 1/2 impact use? Make sure its at least strong enough to at least withstand the use of a 1/2' drive ratchet. I tried to contact the seller, Yet I have not had any replies. I would at least like to replace, or have the item replaced that is broken. The set does grip nice to the torx bolt. As long as you dont use the bits on a stuborn or rusted bolt. the set will work good."
2,Junk,They look cool but the first time I used the t45 it bent like a pretzel. I would not waste my money on these
5,"Beautiful, moving rendition of gorgeous song!","Butterfly Kisses is a beautiful song, and the new version does it justice with the emotion rich voice of Sir Cliff. And to see him perform this song live, as he did in New Zealand February 98, was a real treat! I heard the original Bobby Carlisle version and seeing him perform it live on Oprah, and fell in love with it. Sure it's sentimental! But is there anything wrong with that? This song should be a hit for Sir Cliff, and I recommend it to anyone who likes good music, and hearing someone who can sing well, with feeling! A beutiful, moving rendition of a gorgeous song!"
3,"Low budget indie film, but still enjoyable","This very low budget and amateur movie is still pretty enjoyable for what it is. As a midwest guy who ventures out on annual sports road trips with his buddies, I could relate to a lot of the humor in this movie. The characters were right on (the workaholic, the bored/undersexed family man, the aging party animal, the stats guy, etc.) and I could recognize a little of my friends in all of them. Jim Gaffigan is one of my favorite midwest stand-up comedians, and he was great in the lead role. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this goofy low budget indie movie...but your mileage may vary, depending on how much you can relate to the subject matter."
1,I am disgusted,This record is sooo veeerrry BAD.this crappy group performs only with lousy synthesizers.MUSIC IS NOT MUSIC WITHOUT GUITARS AND DRUMS.Dont listen to or buy this lousy album.Get POWERSLAVE from IRON MAIDEN instead.
5,IMPRESSIVE,"I have been listening to DM for many years and this time something possessed me to buy one of their albums.(my sis has many) Now, if someone wanted to by it from me I wouldn't sell it for the world! I think all the album is worth listening to. buy this one you wont be sorry!!"
5,Carousel: Complete & Splendid!,"For years I've been collecting musicals from both Broadway & movies and have always felt cheated by the incompleteness of most recordings. What a treat to finally have a recording containing the ballet, reprise, introduction, and bonus material from the 1956 musical ""Carousel"". No longer do I have to sit with my video tape and try to create my own complete soundtrack recording, it's finally done for me and very welcomed indeed. The ballet music from ""June is Bustin' Out All Over"" and ""Louise's Ballet"" are worth the purchase alone. Carousel is my favorite R & H musical. Did you also know that it was also the personal favorite of Richard Rodgers? The reviewer who had a problem with the foot stomping should never buy 42nd Street. I love this CD and (though it's not perfect) can recommend it without any reservations!"
5,Lovely Carousel,The music from this film really gets to me especially the live duet between Julie Jordan and Billie Bigalow. That What's The Use Of Wonderin and You'll Never Walk Alone especially when Billie has just died make me weep. also that haunting Carousel Waltz is such a masterpiece.
4,Pretty good book!,"Some pictures and steps are not very clear, also alot of info has been generalized so if you have rebuilt some transmissions in the past it should help you. If you are new to rebuilding transmissions, search around for a DVD video, you will be much better off. But all in all, I'm glad I bought this one with my skill set."
3,AOD shortcomings,"I bought this book to help me overhaul my AOD transmission, and although it has some good info and pictures, it lacks important info like clearances and parts breakdown/diagram."
1,The title is a LIE,The actual coverage of all FORD transmissions is a damned lie. I was looking for the transmission for a 2002 Lincoln and it was not in the book nor was most recent ford automatic transmissions. This title is very missleading at best and a damned lie at worst.
4,Enjoyable and relaxing,"This DVD is not too challenging but provides great stretching and relaxation. The only part I do not like is what she calls the ""keep up"" exercise to develop mental stamina. I find it dangerous for me to do this because of my existing shoulder dysfunction. It would be nice if another alternative exercise was presented for those who may be unable to use the shoulder in this way, but I suspect most people would not have a problem with it."
5,Wonderful - This DVD is a godsend,"I'm 23 weeks pregnant and had done kundalini yoga on and off before getting pregnant, but haven't been able to find a prenatal kundalini class in my area. I couldn't sleep and at 4am started this DVD - it instantly felt calming and soothing, the exercises all felt wonderful and as intense or mild as I wanted them to be. I felt so much more peaceful after doing the DVD, and look forward to doing it every day from now on."
4,great purchase,"I bought 4 prenatal work out DVDs to try. This is my favorite yoga DVD. Very fluid movements, not choppy like many other Yoga DVDs I have or have done. It is soothing, easy to listen to and follow and provides a good overall stretch with some decent strength training. Easy enough to get through if you are just begining. Challenging enough if you work out regularly. If you work out 3 or more times a week you may find this to not be challenging enough but still very good four your mind and soul."
5,Great for everyone!,"This dvd is excellent - for me it is perfect for low-energy days, but still challenging. The music is relaxing as is the narrative.I am in my 3rd trimester and find it helps with swelling in my legs and tightness in my hips. I would say this dvd is also appropriate for women who are beginners to yoga."
3,STAY GOLD PONYBOY......,"Oops,Got My S.E. Hinton's confused there for a moment..I'm okay now,let us proceed...Another big-screen adaptation drawn from the quadrilogy of junior high must-reads written by Ms. Hinton,This was the only one delivered to us by the Walt Disney Studios.That fact is of particular note since there are scenes that involve both guns and drugs,And neither Kim Richards or Burt Convy are anywhere to be found!--Watching the film today,it doesn't work as well as it did 22 years ago,but then I'm 22 years older(ouch!)and look at film in a way I didn't(or couldn't)back then..The kids will enjoy it,and you will enjoy sharing it with them-So own it!....Just make sure you purchase the Disney edition as it is remastered and presented in widescreen for your protection....."
4,Great,"I personal loved the book and i have never actually seen the DVD or Vhs but i bet it is really good. I also read the outsiders and saw the movie the book was excellent. The movie was very good and all but i would have to had these certain in that were not in the movie, which i would have like to seen. i loved the book so much thats how i decided to read Tex. i had fun reading both and they were both well worth it."
1,The first Disney flop,"This was the first movie I walked out of a theater on. I couldn't even stay to see it all it was so boring. The only apeal is if you are a harp core fan of any of the actors and you don't care how bad their movies are. The acting was not that great. The story, if there was one, was not interesting at all. I walked away thinking Disney really went down with this one and wondered if they could go any lower."
2,I have seen better,I bought this DVD because of the 5 star rating. It was soooo bad I gave it away. This is the first DVD I have every given away because it was not worth watching.
4,Rebecca Love topless 3.5 stars,The entire 'Bikini Brawl' event is filmed in a yard. I was impressed by how hot the women are and by Rebbeca Love's ample frontal nudity. The wrestling matches are basically a woman being held down so the camera can zoom in on her junk. And they never really resemble a fight in terms of action. So to summarize the DVD is all eye candy but no a**kicking.
2,UNsatsfying,The best thing about this book is the title - it sets your mind thinking but the book never lives up to those expectations - no substance to the book. Could have been so much better given the subject matter. Not a recommended buy.
3,Conscience and Economics,"I found this book fascinating. Mr. Perkins explains so many things about events in the world for the last 35 years that I had some misconceptions about -- especially the Panama Canal.I find that the author is extremely articulate. Although I don't understand economics that well, he made complex conceptions about global economies clearer. This book will definitely make readers re-think the role of the United States in world economics if that reader will view it with an open mind.My only problem with the book is his bothered conscience cropping up so frequently right from the beginning of his career but his inability to do something about that for so long. But it makes me ask myself what would I eventually do?"
5,Thank you Mr. Perkins,"Almost daily on the news a foreigner is telling us to stay out of the business of his country. But from what I read in the newspapers, all we do is send them massive amounts of aid and build their infrastructure. So what's the problem?? John Perkins explains it. This book answers so many questions, mainly about why the rest of the world 'hates' us.Now if only Mr. Perkins could explain the US immigration policy so succinctly."
5,Made me want to read more about USA from the outside,"I read this book based on its rating. It definately is one of the top best-sellers because it made me think about how the US is viewed from the outside. It jump-started my desire to read more about the US Economy and learn how our management of global resources (which in turn fuels our addictive purchasing habits) affects other views of the US.The book discusses a lot of the history of oil resources and how the US made arrangements to acquire this oil. It also alerts the reader to the value of oil and the crux is plays not only on our country, but other emerging countries.I gave it 5 stars because it gave me new insight into arguments when discussing global resources and debates about terrorism. Although it gave me a bad taste of the USA after reading it, I begin to realize that without control of resources, I might not have this opportunity to enter this opinion from the USA into Amazon. Thus, I'll stay neutral and continue more reading."
2,Underwhelming,"I had much higher expectations about getting an inside view, but Perkins superfically goes over a historical record that is all too well known. At one point he confesses to taking a bribe to not publish the book, but who on earth would feel threatened by such a tepid ""expose""? And his incessant moralizing becomes lethally tedious about halfway through. Yeesh..."
2,Self indulgent and lacking depth,"While this is readable and ties in several historical threads of the past 30 years, in the result Perkins fails to make his case that development finance is merely a tool of the ""evil capitalist empire"". He makes inferences, allusions and assumptions, but he failed to show enough evidence or connectivity to convince one that investing in power plants, roads, ports, etc is a net negative for developing countries. Sure, the world is connected, financed and full of agendas -- lets not throw out the economic baby with caveat-emptor bathwater. Or, as we say in emerging markets, ""the only thing worse than being exploited by the developed world is NOT being exploited"". Perkin's ""guilt"" wears a bit thin as he fully believes he's sinful, but accepts the paychecks for 30 years before finally letting go and coming clean. Like Democracy, Capitalism is the worst system, except for all the others."
4,act out of your conscience or live the consequences,"there are many great, kind and charitable americans. the presidents and the government represented american....for years, as now everyone knows that there was no nuclear weapon found in iraq, haliburton is still making great money. people like bush family, dick cheney have a lot to do with this company. they made great money. they were the one declaring war. and they were the ones making friends with the dictators of the world. look where it has got america and the world. i hope McCain will not win. and obviously the lady running mate of his. with all due respect, someone who has little education, and pro-live and pro-gun. imagine the future of america and the world in the hands of these duo.this book is an eye opener. the view it presented has tied in with the facts i have previously known.american should care more about the rest of the world and the action of their leaders. indifference can otherwise be very costly"
5,Delivered as Promised,"If you want your eyes to be opened to what really goes on in the world - why thirld world countires remain third world countries - if you want to understand why there are riots held wherever the World Bank meets - if you want to see why the West is despised so much....then this is the book for you. I never knew that any of this happened - John Perkins deserves more attention to speak about this topic. However, you will only get this information for the most part by purchasing this book. Will definitely turn your opinion upside down. A great read and education."
3,A good point of View,"I think this is an OK book. It has a point of view on world politics and economics that is not very often brought up.Some parts of the book seemed a bit naive, but overall, I would recommend it to a friend."
4,Confessions of an Economic Hit Man,"easy read, interesting, logical theory on world economics and American hegemony in the world economy."
5,Illuminating and Troubling,"A great book because it dares to speak the truth. John writes with a smooth flow and with lots of powerful anecdotes. It is a book that will change your life, if you allow it.Check out a great interview with John and about the book as well as his views of the state of America and its relationship to the world at www.smallacts.blogspot.com"
2,Didn't Pass the Smell Test,"This book was recommended to me and while I might have anticipated enjoying reading it, if for no other reason than political slant, as a liberal it ultimately left me cold. The book is written in a very thin manner, nearly devoid of detail and color - more of a rough screen play than a true memoir. Nearly every other page had some leaden anecdote or other experience that did not ring true. The author's NSA ""recruitment"" and his ""Dinner With Andre"" education by an older female co-worker into a supposed Economic Hit Man (EHM) was quite unbelievable and literally incredible. If nothing else, the story doesn't make sense on face value. the NSA is an electronic intelligence gathering agency. The CIA or even the DIA would have been more believable sources of EHM."
1,Honesty appears to be a problem,"I gave up reading this after a brief start. The man just isn't honest. The ""recollected"" conversations with his ""trainer/seducer"" that occured 35 years ago so stretched credibility that it just didn't seem worth the time. And to blame his being suckered into what he now considers his very unethical life because his dad wouldn't let him date the girls in his town is just laughable. Certainly, those who are strongly oriented to seeing everything the US does in foreign policy as evil empire building intended only to serve the industrial military complex, will be tempted to accept everything written here as gospel truth. Others I think will see here is a sad man trying to make sense out of a life by spinning a simply incredible story."
1,Laughed out loud,"As insubstantial as cotton candy or the stuff dreams are made of. This is an author in need of a therapist, not a publisher. If you believe anything in this book, you will believe that giant Masonic lizards rule the earth through their agent, Queen Elizabeth."
1,off the wall,"This author simply doesn't understand major league international finance. I won't argue that the World Bank and the IMF need overhauls, however, Perkins says ""our underlying objective is to burden the (foreign) country with debts it couldn't repay"". and the intent of electrical projects all over the world is to benefit a few of the wealthy and ""widen the gap between the rich and the poor"". HUH? This guy is nuts. I suppose he also thinks the objective of the TVA was to widen the gap between the rich and the poor. I can assure Perkins that the intent of private sector lenders is to get their money back with interest and the intent of the rating agencies is to analyse and critic objectively the work of feasibility studies. Maybe he just worked for a bad apple. He admitted that he was a bad apple. Now he is trying to capitalize on it. A shame. Don't bother reading the book."
5,TRUE CONFESSIONS,I BELIEVE EVERY WORD OF JOHN PERKINS' BOOK. HE WRITES ABOUT UGLY AMERICANS AND TELLS US WHY 9/11 HAPPENED. RECOMMENDED READING FOR ANYONE WHO WISHES TO KNOW WHAT AND WHO LIES BEHIND OUR FOREIGN POLICY. IT IS A SAD COMMENTARY ON HOW OUR GOVERNMENT HAS DISREGARDED THE RIGHTS AND ASPIRATIONS OF CITIZENS OF OTHER COUNTRIES. ALSO HOW LITTLE WE HAVE LEARNED FROM VIETNAM!
2,Conspiracy Theory Economics / Republican Bashing,"The book was written to highlight how US corporations use international organizations like the World Bank, IMF etc. to further their own interests, and if that fails we murder foreign leaders and go to war.I found some of the writting interesting, but despite the writers claim that both republican and democratic leaders are involed in the enslavement of foreign contries, he describes every republican since the 60's in a negative light while proping up the work of the likes of Jimmy Carter. Then bashes Reagan, Bush Sr., Bush Jr. and conveniently skips over 8 years of Clinton.His leftist agenda and conspiracy theory type story is interesting, but credibility is damaged by his obvious and thinly vailed liberal views.Chances are if you are liberal you will love the book and if you are more conservative you will not."
5,should be required reading for all high school seniors,"Perkins gives us insight into policies that many suspected but few knew the inter-workings. The means to make developing nations financially obligated to Western powers through the marketing of schemes that could never live up to the promised economic benefits is shown in dramatic terms. For those who wish to understand the dynamics of USA foreign policy, this book is a must."
4,American Empire - Get Educated!,Length:: 5:08 MinsThis book is a real eye opener about what is happening around the world. Mr. Perkins tells ALL about the American Empire and the ruthlessness of power and wealth of a few. The American people need to read this book and take action. You can check out the book summary at successprogress.com
4,Enlightening and Shocking,"This book is enlightening and shocking. It is an incredible account of the more sinister side of business and politics. And it reads like a novel. I highly recommend it.I was a little disappointed, however, at the relatively superficial analysis of the causes of the human desire to expand an empire and take advantage of others. Therefore, the solutions he offers for how to address the problem of ""corporatocracy"" seem superficial and insufficient. I would love to read an updated version that offers better inspiration to change this sad side of humanity - if it is even possible.Nevertheless - this one book offers an amazing education in ""corporatocracy."""
3,Confessions of An Economic Hit Man,"Perkins' stories of his experiences abroad are valuable and worthy of communicating. I would recommend this book for any international relations student or those planning a career in foreign service. While he did not open my eyes to anything new, I certainly feel he credibly develops a picture of how the Game of Empire is played."
4,an interesting memoir,"This work alleges much of post-WW2 development and modernization involves inflated financial projections used to justify projects that ultimately provide revenue for western companies and indebtedness (servitude) for third-world clients. Further, these projects often destroy the unique with colonial mediocrity exclusively benefiting first world parents. Finally, local politicians that disagree with the development agenda are vulnerable to `enforcers' (regime change).The author provides a well written, first hand account backing his claims. Read it and decide for yourself."
1,Confessions of an Economic Hit May,"This is one of the worst books I have read in a long time. All his mistakes in life are someone elses fault (ie, his parents, school, wives, employer,etc.) It amazes me he stayed with the organization for 3 decades and FINALLY decided it was evil. He takes no responsibility for his actions. Sour grapes to me."
2,"Great idea, bad writting","While the premise and experience are worthy of a read, the author's style was not something I could get used to. I'm glad I read the book but couldn't recommend it."
3,Good but Grandiose,"I really expected more from this book. It was billed as an ""insiders"" view of economic misdeeds; however, of any nafarious misdeeeds by the authuor were not included in the book. And by not included, I mean that overstating a estimate of energy usage is not what I would call a economic ""Hit"".There was as interesting historical prespecitves that I learned about: like that the Panaama Canal was initally started by the French; or that Noreiga was on the CIA payroll for more that 20 years.But all in all , the author makes himself out to be a ""spy"" when really the book reveals that he was a door-to-door sells man of energy contract. Nice, but no ""Econinic"" hitting that I could see."
1,embarrassingly poor treatment of an important topic,I wish I read the reviews before purchasing this book. There is little to add beyond what most of other 1-star raters have already said. It's an important subject that has been tortured by a self aggrandizing individual. The are far too little facts or analysis for this book to be taken seriously. Very depressing to see an important topic presented so poorly.
2,"Not Economics, Not Politics, Lots of Feelings","This book is supposedly about an interesting topic - the economic interactions of developing nations and industrialized ones, but the topic has been written about better and in more detail elsewhere. The author admits to not having ever regarded himself as an economist, so it is not surprising that he fails to actually talk about economics, but he does not really even talk much about international politics, or any sort of factual events in any depth; he simply rehashes the fact that American corporations work with politicians to unfairly take advantage of developing nations. The book is about him more than anything else, specifically his personal feelings about the events of his own life.If you want to read an unpoetic exposition of the feelings of a not particularly gifted writer, this is the book for you. If you want to read about corporate imperialism, international economics, or politics look elsewhere."
2,still a selfish egocentric prick,"I first heard John at Powell's in Portland several months ago and saw him on Democracy now. It was a lively discussion and he was thrown a few hardballs. He has some intersting things to say, but his book lacks flow and continuity, and the last 60-80 pages are void of anything useful. It starts good, and gets worse as it goes, but luckily it is an easy read so I didn;t waste too much time. I believe he got into his field because he was a self serving sob, and I think he wrote this book just to be seen as an altruistic hero-more ego gratification."
3,A bearable introduction to the subjeects of globalization and corporations.,"This book seems to be embellished somewhat to make it more interesting. The base information on the western governments, corporations, etc is factual, and this book holds some great information on those subjects. With that said, much of the writing focuses on the author's personal life, and there is not suffient footnotes. For that, I cannot give this movie more than 3.5 stars.If you read this book and it opened your eyes, I would suggest renting or buying a great documentery dealing with similiar subject matter entitled ""The Corporation"". Available from amazon below:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007DBJM8/ref=cm_rv_thx_view/102-6408610-5017740?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v;=glance&n;=130"
5,Confession of an Economic Hit Man,It is an eye opening revelation and confession.Every leader in developing world should read this bookand refer to it when ever makes an important decision on economiccooperation issues.
3,Terrible ending...,"The Book is very interesting, kind of James Bond tales that a lot of older men prefer to tell women to make it sound more interesting. Seems like this guy in fact work with the 'dark side' but I am so totally disappointed with the ending - the author says that now, after reading his book, people must take action and try to do something about the horrific situation that his work of 35 years helped create. I'd say - too late, mister. I am not buying into your remorse. You made enough money and connections on this and to put an ending like this asking for public help frankly does not help much.But the book is very informative, interesting - if you enjoy James Bond kind of tales."
5,Wow!,"This book gives a wonderful documentation about life in the James Bond lane. Even if 25% of the story is true, it's a ""Wow""!"
4,Great book!,I have not been able to put it down. What a great insight to our financial world economies!
2,"Fits my personal beliefs. Alas, no facts where needed most.","If you want a good read that superficially confirms your fears or if you like sneering at the gullibility of folks who believe this is a true historical record, buy this book. Otherwise, donate your time and energy to a good cause.The premise fits well with my overall view: no conspiracy but the belief system and social constructs of Americans, especially powerful and influential people, allow us to exploit the world and remain blissfully unaware of the suffering we create and/or exacerbate. However, the book doesn't stand up to critical reading: facts at key points are missing, many incidents are too cliché, dialogue is too smooth and trite, the author claims too much prescience and understanding during his younger years, it all fits so neatly together and has none of those nasty contradictory facts that real events generate as a matter of course. It just doesn't have any meat (or protein and essential nutrients, if you're a vegetarian)."
1,"Can't rate all of it, but what I know is seriously wrong","The book sounds good, but in the only part I know something about he got it 180 degrees wrong. Makes me wonder about the rest of the book.On page 68, line 5 Perkin says: ""A coup overthrew Arnulfo Arias, the latest in the parade of dictators, and Omar Torrijos emerged as the head of state, although he had not actively participated in the coup"". Well, in fact Arnulfo Arias was freely elected and overthrown 11 days into his presidency by the military (yes, Torrijos did not particpate, he overthrew his comrades a while later). The saga spiraled down all the way down to Noriega. Torrijos was charming, but he was a dictator, make no mistake about it."
1,nonsensical,"if you believe this, then you believe in the subjects of his other books: psychonavigation, time travel, and shapeshifting. not to mention santa claus, the easter bunny, and the tooth fairy."
2,Naive and Self-Serving,"The story reads quickly and I found it difficult to believe that the author could have spent so much time in the developing world and could have, at the same time, have been so incredibly naive. Autobiography by its nature is self-serving and this book does not disappoint. He proudly proclaims himself as a corporate hit man, but at every turn, his actions identify him as a dupe. I don't know whether to feel pity for the author, bumbling around Asia and Latin America wanting to rebel against the establishment and yet not having the courage to do so -- or to simply write him off as a ""white man overseas"".I can't recommend the book except as an example of how not to be at every possible level."
3,"Very interesting glimpse into international world, somewhat simplistic cultural perspetive","It is fascinating to get an inside look look at how the international business world works, and the motivations of the people in it. That said, the author is very good at being critical of his own culture, but not so much with other ones. He should try being homosexual in some of the traditional societies he seems to highly regard."
1,Fact or Fiction?,"John Perkins semi-biography is completely without substance. Unfortunately he is now a cult hero among members of the ""conspiracy"" club. A recent Sunday NY Times Business Section piece on him points out several fatal flaws in his book. Not sure what he was smoking back in the 1970s but seriously doubt Jo Lo lookalike seduced him to get him to take his ""economic hit man"" job. His discussion of the jackals...is totally without any merit. I think he should have published EHM as a work of fiction."
1,Not Substantive,"John Perkins wrote a book that contains no real insight. Most of the information in the book is available through other sources. There was also no satisfaction of him taking us from the start of a project to the end. He speaks vaguely of his various projects, never confiding in us about any details. However, he took ample time to talk about his feelings of guilt and second-guessing. For someone who second-guessed himself as much as he claimed to have, he seemed to make it through a good 20+ years of this work. Without the details, the stories do not have the ring of truth. And, the imposition of his self-doubt and guilt on virtually every page, just leaves the whole story flat and unmoving. And the biggest question is, if he really was a member of such a ruthless and powerful organization, how can it be that he is still alive after writing this book?"
3,Good ...but,"It is a good biography, but a little bit speculative on the history with hookers in Panama and other places. If you have been in any of these countries there are better places for people like Mr. Perkins ...none of any foreing business men, entrepeneurs, or diplomats needs to go to places as those refered by Mr. Perkins to have fun.From the political point of view I don't believe that Corporations like Bechtel are engage in these political affairsas such.Finnaly, why a country as important for oil as Venezuela (much much more than Equator) was no mentioned as a target for the EHM?Diego GonzalezCaracas, Venezuela"
1,"Yucky, icky, whacky, goofy . . . blah, bleh, duh","I see I am not alone in my response to being required to read this book. I thought I was taking economics, not extremist contemporary politics. This book is ludicrous. The author is a false-prophet, make-believe tattle-tale. I do not approve of knocking down my country in order to make book sales. I do believe in fairness, equality, human rights and all those values Perkins suggests he shares. And yet, I do not get the sense that we share anything at all. I believe in those things truly and do not banter them about as part of some self-serving, self-hating agenda. Anyway, this goof is no hit man. He's just another guy that did bad things and is atoning for them by doing more bad things."
5,A Startling View Into the Corruption Rampant in World Governments,"This book is a must-read for everyone who wants to learn how governments REALLY operate. John Perkins gives a detailed, insider's view of the corruption that is rampant in our own government (and others) and to the fact that the US will use all means available to gain world domination.Considering how fascinating this book is I was amazed at the number of one-star reviews. This book paints the United States government in a very unflattering light. It includes details on criminal behavior by past presidents and other government officials. It shouldn't be surprising that there are many people who will make false reviews in order to discredit this book.Ignore the poor reviews and read this book. It will give you information you will find nowhere else."
3,"How long before ""insider"" info is no longer insider information?","Author notes he resigned in 1980. His book was published in 2004. The recent course of events such as 9/11 in 2001 and the economic collapse of 2008 were much later than his active involvement in 1970's. An insider back in 1970's can provide important details of what happened then. I am not sure how easily it pertains to something so many years later. The author can provide insight and speculation, but lack details if out of the loop for so many years. Mike Ruppert and David Ray Griffin and Paul Rea provide compelling evidence of what happened on 9/11. The DVD ""Inside Job"" and Naomi Prins' book ""It takes a pillage"" provide details of the economic collapse of 2008. Check these out here in Amazon as well."
5,Foreign policy strategies revealed,"If you never seem to know why our government's foreign policies are hard to understand, or if you wonder why we worry about genocide in Bosnia but not in Sudan, this book is for you. Dozens of questions about US policy abroad are answered here. A must read."
4,Confessions of an Economic Hit Man,"A real eye opener/confession from a top quality writer that ""walked the walk"". This is a MUST READ for all who labor under the false assumption that the USA is always the good guy in world economics, third world development, or love thy neighbor.May this detailed, inside report motivate concerned US citizens to analyize carefully and vote for fairness and true freedom on election day."
5,great read,"Great read. Short chapters for quick fixes, but incredibly hard to put down. A sobering look at Post WWII history from inside the corporatocracy. Packed full of history that didn't make the news. Read this book and then pass it on."
4,Enlightening,"This book has been out since 2004. It is enlightening to read it in 2009 because there are some predictions made that have come true. Additionally, John Perkins has so much insight because he lived it. I experienced many feelings while reading ""Confessions."" 1) Perkins has reaped the benefits of his actions and now he can speak out; 2) We must all get involved and do something to save all the people on the planet; 3) I have to look at my own behavior. Even though I am not the worst offender, I am a participant in this calamity.Everyone can learn something from this book."
3,Why only 3 stars,"Certain facts are not really facts, e.g. the CIA orquestrated the coup that ended the Allende government in Chile. (I know that isn't true....I'm Chilean and was a direct witness of the chaotic situation under Allende.....He was overthrown after a resolution by Chile's House of Representative asking the military to put and end to such a chaos."
5,Connect the dots,"I bought this book on a recommendation of a Friend. I found it to be a wonderful read, yet truly a frightening eye opener about how our government really works. I've since loaned this book to a couple of other friends and both of them came to the same conclusion. ""We've known all along about what the Corporations and the government really do and this book just connected the dots and put the whole picture into perspective."""
4,An interesting story of large scale international development,"Author John Perkins confesses his role in a high level international construction and engineering marketing scheme to take advantage of the developing world.Perkins, as a respected economist on Charles T Main's staff, would fake his predictions of economic benefit to a developing country which would then borrow the money to construct the dam or whatever and retain Main and its colleagues to design and build the boon dogle.The book no doubt will be ignored by those in the know since it broadly indicts many of the leaders in the construction and financing industries.I would call the book frightening but worth reading."
5,Reality check.,This book is a must read especially with the current economic crisis in mind. It is a reality check for the reader. I could not put it down until I finished.
3,Corporatocracy,"For a subject as dull-sounding as that of ""Confessions of an EHM"", John Perkins actually writes very approachably. The contents of this disturbing tell-all pretty much confirm suspicions of conspiracy theorists about the ""corporatocracy"". ""Confessions"" goes a long way towards showing why citizens of other countries might view the US as an evil empire. Perkins' story certainly bears some extra reading to be utterly believable, but most of the facts are laid out right there. This is a must read for anyone who has been wondering how things went so wrong with the US."
3,Confessions indeed.,"John Perkins gives a good account of his understanding of how the building blocks of empire in this new age of global finance is achieved. There is one question that I tried to answer throughout the book, but could not find the answer. John seems to feel very guilty, and attempts to purge his sins with this book. ¿Are his economic ""hits"" just the tip of the iceberg? For that I'll have to wait to finish reading Chalmers Johnson's book Nemesis. John fails to deliver the broader vision that Chalmers does into the working of empire building and its relation to the failing republic."
1,"Looks, walks and quacks like fiction","I understand the author claims these accounts are real but, having just finished the book, I find that impossible to believe. The characters feel fictitious. The dialogue sounds fake. The politics are ridiculously extreme. Everything about this book is wrong, exaggerated or hateful. I am very disappointed. I would like a refund."
4,Nice reading,"Very interesting to read, especially parts that his team ruined economies of developing countries including my beloved Indonesia. If you want to read for a fiction-like book, it's perfect. It has all the elements. If you need supporting facts, there's almost none. It's great to read, though i find sometimes that this guy a bit ``whiney,'' he could've stopped earlier."
5,Read this and then tell your friends to read it....,"Incredible.....I found it believable which makes it scary.....There is a lot in here that I don't want to believe and most americans probably would not want to believe, so read it and pass it on...."
2,Not even an airplane read,"""I convinced myself,"" the author writes on page 30 about his employment in a admittedly greedy company presided over by immoral men, ""that if learning more, by experiencing it, I could better expose it later--the old 'working from the inside justification.'"" I refuse to willfully disregard my bullshi* meter when reading a so-called ""confession."" You should too."
3,Economic hit man,"The book starts out with speciifc strong facts. However, towards the end it becomes significantly weaker and less convincing. Overall wothwhile reading, as long as you do not believe every word."
3,Good-n-Fruity,"The first half of this book seemed legitimate, and even if it is not, it is definitely a well written page turner. Unfortunately the latter part of the book seems to go a bit to far into supposition, rather than hard fact, and does not make the distinction. If the Mr. Perkins had made this distinction, or simply stopped writing where his first hand knowledge ended, this book would seem much more credible.As it stands now, the latter part of the book focuses too much on the Altruistic agenda that Mr. Perkins would like to advance. While many of his opinions I agree with, such as reducing consumption of oil, and no longer shopping at mega-corporations, this book was not the proper venue, and his venting seems to discredit the firsthand knowledge in the first part of the book.However, the book is a good read, and I suggest you read it with an open mind."
3,Self-congratulatory,"Although I enjoyed this book and it provides an excellent alternative and eye-opening point of view, the author is self-serving and the writing is clumsy. I seriously question the existence of a vast right-wing conspiracy that all presidential administrations over the past 35 years have participated in. While I believe some of this economic mischief goes on, since time immemorial nations have been expected to act in their own interests. The US is no different. Is it really the role of government to provide charity to other nations? This seems to be what the author suggests the US do - become caretaker of the world."
4,Good Read - I was Hoping for Better,"If you're interested in reading about ""conspiracy theories,"" this is a decent read. Stories of the author's experiences in South America will give you some satisfaction. Sadly, truth is not always as interesting as fiction - there is no MASTER PLOT uncovered in this book.Also, the writing was a little ""inelegant?"" at times - could have been tightened-up a bit.But, unless you're intimately interested in this subject, this book should do nicely - just enough to keep you on your toes about the global economy and all the ""good"" it brings to third world economies."
1,True Confessions,"There are no confessions in this book pertaining to an economic hitman. There are some historical facts regarding US foreign policy since 1951 however anyone who has read or researched these facts should not waste their time with this book. If you are looking for a brief overview of US foreign policy in the last 50 years then perhaps you may find parts of this book enlightening.The frustration I have with this book is that there are no confessions from the standpoint of an economic hitman. This book feels more like the author created a character that he thought might exist in the matrix of US foreign policy and then said he was this character. Again, this is due to the fact that there is no information in this book that is specific to what he did as an economic hitman."
1,Charlatan's Tale,"If you're looking for 1/s pound of side splitting laughs--at the author--with a table spoon of revulsion and half a cup of disgust, give this entree a try. Then, send it back to the chef!Keep in mind, when the ""author"" is not pretending to be a secret agent, he is writing books about his travels through space and time and voodoo magic.He's a nutcase. This book is nutty. How did this book get imposed upon me? Would the book publishing and distribution world please conspire to keep this fruit out of my bookstore basket? Thank you."
2,Horribly slow,"The book was good. In nice condition and everything, but it took forever to ship. I needed it and ordered it two weeks in advance, and it got here after my we were supposed to have read the first two parts (three weeks after I ordered it), so needless to say, I had to go out and buy one from Waldenbooks before this one arrived. Three weeks to send a book is insane."
2,"Should be classified as ""fiction"" as opposed to a ""memoir""....","Granted that yes, corporations/governments/NGOs may not always have the best interest of developing nations at heart, it simply is not concievable that a mid-level economist could/would have such an ability to shape development and funding for all of these projects. Economists, yes, do play a significant role by forecasting and or analyzing the impact of a project, but to assume that one as the ""ultimate power broker"" seems more fictional and Ludlum-esqe as opposed to a memoir.This book is more of an apology for inflating statistics or percieved misdeeds for fostering third world development."
1,Total Fiction!,"It simply scares me to think that some who read this book will believe that what it says is true. While this theory of economic imperialism isn't technically impossible, it's the kind of idea better left to an ideological blog somewhere instead of a book purporting to be a true account. Books like this make the left look as naive and stupid as Ann Coulter books make the right look bigoted and, well, stupid. This is an incredibly implausible account, and books like this, claiming to be nonfiction, undermine good writing and reporting everywhere. Shame on the author and the publisher. The only redeeming quality of this book was that it contained a list of other books published by Berrett-Koehler, the contents of which make it obvious that BK is simly a peddler of 4th rate crackpot theories, all of which appear to be of the nonfiction variety."
2,"Could be interesting, but....","They may have trained him to become an Economic Hit Man, but obviously book writing was not part of the training course. The way chapters are organized does not make a lot of sense. He starts talking about Iraq, and a couple of paragraphs later, the story switches to Latin America.He tries to paint himself as a good guy by providing his regrets here and there, but he just keeps doing it. Overall, I also sensed that there are some degrees of exaggerations."
2,Could Have Been Much Better,"When I saw this book at the book store, I just had to buy it because not only did it look incredibly interesting, but the cover looked pretty darn neat.After the first few chapters, a few things became apparant. Not only was the book very vague, but John Perkins keeps referring to his moral tug of war. Which was so incredibly repetitive, that it just made me want to return the book and find something else to read. But I kept with the book to only realize that the dialogue was very poorly written and unrealistic. I then realized that his job as an ""economic hit man"" was no where near as interesting as the blurb on the back of the book leads the reader to beleive.This book could have been a masterpiece given the subject at hand. But the writing and amateur story telling leave this book a confusing mess."
4,Good read,"The book got a bit too preachy/personal, but I liked the journey and I liked reading about the various countries where I have previously not paid too much attention to when it comes to globalization. I found Indonesia very interesting. The style of writing is good for those small detials that you wouldn't find elsewhere."
1,Fabulist?,"I read this book until I just couldn't take it anymore. I'd heard someone describe the book and was anxious to get the inside scoop on how the world bank and other international lenders are screwing poor countries, but this book became less and less believable the more I read it. It doesn't feel like an honest account, it reads like fiction, posing as non-fiction. It's either the result of a horrible writer who can't get past his ego to tell what really happened, or it's a con, or disinformation. I feel cheated that I spent money on this book.Oh, and on the possibility that it is a truthful account, John Perkins is an unconscionable a**h*le trying to squeeze a little more profit out of his career of bad deeds."
1,How to make money......,".....first, Perkins claims to have conned nations into plunging themselves into monster-debt scenarios, second, Perkins feels awful about it whilst touring the Amazon, third, Perkins writes a book, telling us how bad he was.If there ever has been a shallow, basic (if not simplistic) and hair-raising account of how the American corporate world conquers the rest of the globe - this is it.To trump it all: admitting to having made good money when acting as an EHM, Perkins now seeks to capitalize on his confessions. An utter waste of time."
2,Not Quite Contrite,"I have no doubt that much, but not all, of what Perkins describes in this book actually took place and his telling can be interesting at times. What really clued me in to the fact that he is capable of stretching the truth were his descriptions of Ground Zero after 9/11. I lived at the corner of Liberty and West Side Highway on 9/11 and can say, based on my own experience, that this part of the book is pure fiction. Perkins wants the reader to feel his pain and guilt for having been an EHM but I never got the feeling he was being genuine. He kept going back for second helpings. He rambles while trying to be descriptive and the result is page after page of quite boring reading. This is an OK book to buy if you can find it used and cheap."
2,Felt made up,"Just finished the book and have to say the author's stories seemed very contrived. While many historical facts are presented like the Iraq War or the Control of Panama Canal, the author's stories of meeting ""local people"" seem made up and don't provide any useful evidence to the reader beyond attempting to help the author's own conspiracy agenda. I was hoping for a lot more from this book, but it fails in so many ways, and believe this guy is in the same category as James Frey."
3,"Possibly true, maybe fiction","""Confessions of an Economic Hit Man"" offers a compelling story and an interesting vantage point. John Perkins retells his tale as a chief economist, and his role in building of the new 'empire' - the economic kind - on part of the United States. The data is sparse, and at times the book borders on fiction, but I would not disagree that there many elements of truth in it as well. An interesting read, but also a book to be approached with a healthy dose of skepticism."
2,An exercise in rationalization,"Author's unique position as an economic/development consultant enables him to provide a view of globalization that questions many conventional theories about benefits of international trade and its positive effects on citizens of poor nations. However this book was, by author's own admission, written over many years and a few failed attempts. Unfortunately it shows.It's frustrating that many revelations about exploitation of world's poor that could be much better understood by providing good data and statistics, that the author should be in a great position to gather, is missing.Confession can be a means to admit and accept ones failings. This book does not allow the reader to sympathize with the author simply because it is overly littered with rationalizations for why, in spite of all the opportunities for atonement, author continued on a career he always believed was hurting millions of people around the world."
2,way to far left,"book summary: all corporations are bad, the world was perfect before we discovered petroleum, and if america never existed there would be no world hunger, poverty, or military dictatorships.yes, it really is this left wing. very well written though."
3,Not entirely without merit,"There's some interesting material in this book, mostly the brief historical overviews of US government involvement in the various parts of the world Perkins visited, but it is overwhelmed by page after page of uninteresting and self-absorbed autobiographical material. Far better to spend one's time reading something more substantial like Michael Parenti's ""Against Empire"" or Greg Palast's ""The Best Democracy Money Can Buy."""
1,could have confessed on the internet and supplied it for free,"If Perkins really feels remorse and regret he should have made a fact-based report and posted it online for free on the Internet. It seems he is pulling yet another scam by selling a story that no one should buy. Moreover, he should seek forgiveness by donating the millions to the poor people in the developing countries, which he received while operating as an EHM"
5,Inspiring Great Read,"Well Done Mr. Perkins. I've heard some of this before but he does a great job of giving an overview of how it has worked the past 40+ years. I'm just surprised this hasn't caused MORE of a stir, but when I read the 1-star ratings I realize people only believe what fits into their existing view points on the matter. If you don't think the government could possibly have ill motives abroad, then you probably won't have the ability to read and listen to this book. I feel like I've seen enough with the US government to believe anything is possible, and his account definitely supports the outcomes we are experiencing right now. Great book, please read and share with friends. Spread the word!"
2,"Makes you think, but not exactly what he wants you to think","Narcissistic? Yes. Short on details and big on vague generalities? Yes. Outright lies? [Shrug] This book probably has enough truth to hook some otherwise intelligent readers and enough misleading information to make reading it almost useless. However, if you are of the there's-got-to-be-a-lot-of-bad-people-taking-advantage-of-all-us-common-folks persuasion, then this is the book for you. It does a good job of separating the credulous from the critical reader. It also does a good job of boring most of us with Perkins' shallow naval-gazing and contrived self-flagellation. If you read it, try to remember what a truly well-documented and supported work actually looks like. And, for heavens sake, make the contrast. BTW, on a personal level, I'm most affronted by his blatant lies concerning SIL and the (mostly) wonderful people that devote their lives to making the world better for so many people."
2,Too Self-Absorbed,"I'm not quite sure what Perkins is trying to do here. For liberals who read extensively, there's really nothing new. We already know that ""economic development"" is a raw deal foisted upon money-poor countries. We've known that for years. And it's a fairly commonplace observation that debt-servicing and import replacement are scams desgined to keep the rich finance institutions on top forever.But Perkins writes as if he is the first guy to actually break the silence and bring these startling revelations to the world. It just doesn't wash. I'm sure he's telling the truth about most things, and I would imagine that some of the dialogue is a bit artificial. But it really doesn't matter much. It just reads like a novelistic foreground account, written for folks who find reading background macro-material too stale.I would say don't bother."
1,confessions of a boring sychophant,"I gave this worthless book to a friend so that he would have something to use as kindling in his fireplace. I cannot comprehend all of the adulatory reviews. Mr. Perkins advances our understanding of the gangsters out to destroy us not one iota.Readers and researchers would be much better served to purchase the books of the last great American patriot Eustace Mullins instead (Secrets of the Federal Reserve & The World Order).Mr. Mullins is a researcher without peer, and lays bare the nature and history of the true gangsters who are out to destroy us, fiscally and otherwise...."
3,Thought provoking,"To any other mystified American who has ever wondered ""Why do they hate us so much?"", this book sheds some light on a few possibilities. The machinations of the US and its manipulation of other countries' internal affairs for our advantage, to the detriment of the local people, is told in the first person by a confessed perpetrator. Intriguing, and worth a look."
4,Decent Read,"I enjoyed reading this book. At times that entire concept seems far-fetched, not in the fact that this couldn't happen, because it most likely does. But, the fact the Perkins offers almost no credible evidence to back him up, and claims that the company was very secrative about their work. You would think that through all his years with all the guilt he claims to have, he could easily have come up with some sort of paper trail to support his story.Perkins has a very detatched perspective in that he claims to feel bad about what he has done, and claims to have felt that way while doing it (also claims to have gone out of his way to learn about what the people of the countries he was out to destroy economically were all about) yet continues anyway. It seems that he now feels that all is o.k. because he wrote a book about his misdeeds to expose the system, 30 years later, that he claims to have had a major roll in creating."
4,One side of the story.,"I'm not going to waste time re-writing what everyone else had to say. Every story has two sides, and I read this as more/less an autobiography - which is what it's intended to be! I didn't read it as an authoritive history book, as it looks like most other people have.This is one side of the story. There are others, but this one is the personal story of Perkins, which happens to be quite an interesting one."
3,Confessions of a mediocre book,"Interesting, but a little overly dramatic. I've been able to meet and have a pretty in-depth conversation with a former assistant director of the CIA, it does not appear to me that such a large organization can have such a cohesive and well thought out master plan. That is simply not how large complex organiztions behave."
2,Enticing but a general letdown,"I cracked this book open with the hopes of getting an insider's view of how corporate manipulation of international loans works. Unfortunately, Perkins reveals little except his takeaway from the experience. The overall feeling of the book was not that he wants to educate us on the machine and how it works but rather issue a mea culpa. It's long on feelings and short on detail. I was looking for something more well researched and detailed like ""Blackwater"" by Scahill which gives a deep account on how corporate players make money from war and the US government. Unfortunately, Perkins was only able to vaguely confirm what I know to be true, leaving me searching the book racks for someone who can explain the nitty gritty to me. I don't recommend it if you want to answer the ""hows"" of this really big and complex issue."
4,Did he give all the money back?,"It would be fascinating to hear more of the actual numbers involved in all of these shady deals, not to mention the fortune that John raked in as an EHM. I don't think it was enough to merely confess about his morally unjust actions, if liberation of his burden was what he really wanted he should also give ALL the money back to the countries he pillaged.Everyone in the world should know the information in this book and be appalled. It is just a shame that Perkins waited until after 9/11 happened to write this confession. By then the corporatocracy was already planning their exploitation of the situation. Or hell even before the dumbass Bush was elected President. It might have saved Gore some votes if the public knew more about what Bush 1 was up to during his presidency or who Cheney really was. Too little too late if you ask me..."
2,Mildly Disappointing,"Perkins does a pretty good job of starting off this chillingly exciting topic before the story quickly erodes into a repetitive onslaught of bragging. For me, the stories were not believable. Read Gary Webb if you want a true account of the business of War. Save your money and time on this one."
2,Disappointing,"I thought I would learn a lot of interesting ""insider's"" information in this book and frankly I'm wondering if the author has ever been an economic hitman as he pretends he was, because all he is describing can be found in other mainstream books and medias. So if you want to learn the hidden mechanisms of economic colonisation you'de better choose another source!"
5,"Informative book from an insider's perspective, highly recommended","This book illustrates many processes of economic and political globalization. Written from an insider's perspective, reader's learn a lot about what goes on behind closed doors in the corporate and political world. It is well written and easy to get through, very interesting."
4,Worth A Read,"I would certainly say that this book is worth a read. If nothing else it is an eye opener revealing truths about a corporate culture that most Americans like to pretend doesn't exist. The beginning of this book is fantastically written and told like a suspense novel that is quite the page turner. However I only give 4 stars because it does seem to become slow towards the end as if the author is stretching the book out into more that it should be.Another reason I cannot give five stars is because the author repeatedly appears to be putting himself up on a pedestal as the one who did the right thing, when in reality he was one of the ones leading the charge and creating this culture. He is no better than the rest, and had more of a negative impact than many of the others."
3,Worth Further Exploration/Discussion,"I just finished this book, and am disturbed and intrigued enough to follow up with other books on the subject, such as Joseph E. Stiglitz's ""Globalization and Its Discontents"".There are parts of Perkins' story that are hard to digest, but taken as a whole, whether or not you find him sincere, the issue deserves further scrutiny. I would recommend this book to anyone open-minded enough to take Perkins' message seriously.And to the 1-star reviewers who invoke the G8 summit, you obviously didn't read far enough: in order for a country to be eligible for debt relief, the World Bank/IMF demands that it has to privatize a public program, such as its water utilities or education system. I'm sorry, but that seems to SUPPORT the arguments made in the book I just read."
2,doesn't fly,"The author claims we built infrastructure for countries who couldn't/didn't pay us for them. Doesn't sound like a great idea to me. I don't doubt that there are social and environmental problems associated with oil production and these should be addressed, but this book does not really make sense. Would the world be better off without globalization? How would backwards countries ever get started on the road to a modern state? Remember along with some negatives, a modern state means health care, education etc. The author suggests that corporations should have as their major goal helping poor countries rather than profits. Bet they wouldn't be major corporations very long with that attitude and by the way, What would the stockholders think? Bottom line, the author doesn't make his case."
1,Save your Money!,"If you want to read a book that glorifies tin pot dictators and excuses terrorism this is the book for you. This book has little real economic content and Author has little real understanding of capitalism or modern economics. The Author has an agenda of socialism and anti-Americanism that is easily apparent from the start of the book. If you are looking for an Anti-American rant that blames America and capitalism for all the worlds environmental and economic problems you found the right book. The book consists of rant after rant against capitalism, repeats previously discredited conspiracy theories as fact and appears to be nothing but a cry by the Author for you to feel sorry for him. Don't waste your money or your time on this book."
5,Did Rush Limbaugh write the negative reviews???,"I have not yet read this book. I logged on to read the reviews prior to purchasing it. I was struck by the fact that the negative reviews were like listening to Rush Limbaugh. Just one character assassination (of the author, John Perkins) after another. Seems like they were all using the same conservative 'talking points'. I definately WILL read this book. If Limbaugh and his sycophantic 'dittoheads' don't like it there must be something to it."
1,Confessions of an Ecoinomic Hitman,"We have a problem. I have not yet received the item, Confessions of an economic hitman. This is the second try and it does not look as though we are going to have any joy in this regard. I think that we should just give up and suggest that you cancel my order and refund the cost to my credit card. Kindly confirm.K.B. Rowland"
1,Record high score on BS meter,"Wow! For politics that so well comport with my own, I have never been so put off by someone who might seem a kindred. The arguments and accounts put forward by Perkins are incredible or, incredulous. He is obviously no ""spy"" and works for no US government agency. His characters around the world are only regurgitating his own monotone voice. How did his editors let this slip past the review? The book is just kind of repulsive. Jesus appears before him?Perkins is just another greedy consultant tied in with world financing institutions. His retrospective does not reconcile with the historical facts or conventional realities. The US government and its businessmen may do lots of things that are directly and indirectly assailable as unethical. But, his thesis in Confessions is ridiculous even to persons such as me with biases to believe him."
1,WRITTEN BY A COMPLETE EGOMANIAC,"This book is less about historical accuracy than it is about John Perkins' ego. I'm angry that I spent my hard-earned cash on this ""People Magazine"" of an expose. I am sickened that he lifted the Iran portion of his ""story"" straight from Stephen Kinzer...(he did credit Kinzer, but regardless, this story had already been told, and told well). I'd just finished reading ""All the Shah's Men,"" which evoked such memorable images of Kermit Roosevelt, the Iranian nationalist leader Mohammed Mossadegh, Reza Shah and the 1953 coup, and I didn't appreciate Perkins simply re-telling it, using all of Kinzer's energetic & descriptive writing. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK.If you're searching for factual books on contemporary or historical events, go to the men and women who have stellar reputations. This guy is a wimp, an exaggerator, probably a liar, and an egomaniac with an inferiority complex."
2,"Too Few Brightspots, Too Many Soapbox Speeches","After hearing this book mentioned and quoted in many other books and articles I have read, I figured I would give this book a read. I was quite disappointed. The book felt more like a way the author could purge himself of his past sins than writing an informative book about the ""Economic Hitman's"" role in changing the history of the world over the past 30-40 years. There are a few bright spots of really great insight and information which is why I gave the book two stars, but for the most part, the book is one long apologize."
4,wimp factors!??,"the ""wimp factor"" from the first Bush against Panama is still the same as the Wimp factors in his son against Iraq... what tragedy and deception.. learning the politics/coporatocracy of 70s to the presents from an Economy Hit Man was a gut-wrenched journey..highly recommeded although it can be vague with assumptions at times, but its core spirit/truth is valid..In my view, one star ratings/reviews here have their ulterior motives.."
1,Not worth the read - - - not worth the critique,One of the worst books I have ever read. Astonishingly bogus.
1,Publisher Integrity? work of fact and fiction,"My first inkling this was mixing fact and fiction was when the author claims to have aced his grades at a snooty prep school, won an academic scholarship to college, but then couldnt place Ecuador in South America? Anyway, this guy weaves a tale of US conspiracy involving getting countries hooked Aid money all to the benefit of big corporations and the US. His liberal slant and political agenda ruin an interesting subject, and in my eyes destroy any credibility by mixing BS with actual fact. His mentor is a mysterious woman who is using his NSA profile to seduce him into becoming and Economic Hit Man, oh and Indonesian puppetiers knew of the American Conspiracy to conquer the muslim world as far back as 1971?? A must read for liberals and conspiracy theorists. The publisher should probably be ashamed, but I digress."
1,John Perkins: Fraud,"To All:Do not buy this book. John Perkins is a complete fraud. The book is rubbish. The USG and the big banks do enough dirty work. We don't need Walter Mitty's inventing such nonsense. Worked for the National Security Agency, did you? Sure. I suppose the CIA was too old hat for you. For the information of everybody out there, the NSA is the electronic intellgience and code-breaking arm of the U.S. intelligence community. Geeks with earphones and computer nerds. Important work, but the NSA has nothing at all to do with the kinds of things Perkins describes. Want to know what Perkins is? He is a typical gringo goofball who drifted down to Latin America (in this case, Ecuador) and picked up some half-baked nonsense from some leftist books. You find these lost souls all over the place in South America, Central America, and Mexico. He then got the bright idea of inventing his life of darring-do and selling it. Whew! Let this hairball ride on out of town."
2,"The Military-Industrial Complex Is Alive and Well, But This Book Isn't.","A few pages of important and discomfiting facts about our criminal national policies (greed and treachery) upholstered at great length in painfully turgid prose evoking words like egotistical, fatuous, pretentious, verbose, pompous, self-indugent, and illiterate. Seldom have there been so many first-person-singular pronouns in such an uninteresting volume. Could no one have edited this book, preferably down to a magazine article?"
1,"Big Ego, Little value",The guy certainly loves himself. Overall I think it is of questionable judgment to place this book in the non-fiction category. The editor could have done everyone a favor and removed all this guys self-aggrandizement and made the book much shorter and more enjoyable to read. If this is even remotely true it is covered up by this guys ego so regardless of where the story goes the reader is turned off.
2,It's embarrassing to read,"I read the reviews here and assumed that a right-leaning bias was informing most of the reviews of the book. They seemed too harsh to be fair and I dismissed them as coming from the flag-waving ""America Does No Wrong"" demagogues.Let's forget the topic and just address the writing. It's sophmoric- almost embarrassing- to the point I was saying, ""I can't believe his editor allowed this.""The emotional confessions are so one-dimensional it reminds me of a third-grader writing, ""I am happy. Today is good for me and my dog.""I'm not going to comment on the reliability of the content. Fact is, none of us know for certain so it's all speculation. But the style is awful. I couldn't finish the book.Skip this, even if you're a radical-leaning, capitalism-hating anarchist. Read something better, as recommended by other reviews."
1,I can't believe the positive reviews,"This book is a slow and painful read. The author is hopelessly self aggrandizing: he says at one point, ""They were going to make me a millionaire."" Wow! A guy at the center of a global conspiracy involving trillions of dollars and they were going to ""make him"" a millionaire. Not give him a million (which would still be paltry considering...).What? were they going to pay him $100,000 per year and after a while that would ""make him"" a millionaire. This guy was a mid-level manager at best. From there he constructs his grand delusion. Only people who already believe the the U.S. is the cause of all evil in this world (college students, professors and incomprehensibly naive adults) could actually think this book represents reality. If in fact we are enslaving the world to us through debt, then we are enslaving ourselves to the Chinese. Think people think."
1,Dear Mr. Perkins:,"Normally, I'd be eager to read a book such as your""Confessions of an Economic Hit Man"" and today Inearly bought it. However, when I punched in your namein Amazon, I found other books on Shapeshifting,Shamanic techniques and whatnot by a John Perkins.(Certainly it must not be the same person...why...Yesit is!)I don't mind that you are an ex-spook, a writer and anew spiritualist but which one of you are we supposedto believe?And when you give interviews where the discussionsconcerns IMF lending patterns, the American oligarchyand their ulterior motives, etc., shouldn't you alsomention that you are a proponent and prolific writerof new age spiritualism?One persona seems to discredit the other in your case.Unbelievable."
3,Confessions of an Economic Hit Man,"I had to read it for school, but it is still good. If you like reading about the economy, this is a good book for you."
3,First Half is OK,"if you're educated about US-latin america foreign affairs from 60's to 80's , this book should not surprised you . But it's an interesting reading and worthwhile reading. First 4 chapters are more telling and rest of book is expendable."
4,uncerainty,After reading this book I am confused as to why this person want us to believe that he was able to to fool so many people around the world. Does he want us to believe that most of the world cannot see through the Ameican way?
5,Confessions of an Ecomonic Hit Man,I could not phantom some of the outrageous things our country has done to other countries I'm not talking just about war it goes beyond that; It is situations I thought were only done by other nations. It's a great eye opener and a great read.
5,a must read,"if you have heard of this book but cant decided, read it! economics, intrigue and state (not so secret) secrets."
5,Amazing insight into how America was built and maintains its global super power status,"Very interesting book that grabs you from page one and holds your attention begging for more with every page. Deep insight into the inner workings and back office deals that have lead to the rise and power holds that the US has created in order to maintain its dominance as the worlds super power. Its detailed description of all the things we think might be going on, but never really know how or any details of how they occur. Such an amazing book that I will likely read again soon and have recommended to many friends. It pulls you in and is a very entertaining read!"
5,Spellbinding modern history,"This book is spellbinding like a novel and a must read for anyone interested in Post World War II history. It is the story of America's march to dominate world politics and commerce told by an insider, a man who was there when the deals were struck. Although he may upset readers who want to believe that our leaders always wear white hats, the author's stated and obvious intent is to educate. In the end, he helps us see a way to realize America's Founding Fathers' dream of ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"" for all people everywhere. A chilling, yet ultimately positive and encouraging, narrative."
5,Riveting!,"None of this is new to me. The machinations behind global empire have been exposed by Greg Palast in his wonderful book, The Best Democracy Money Can Buy. What makes this book different is that it reads like a spell binding and absorbing spy novel. Mr. Perkins takes us on a wild ride and succeeds in masterfully connecting the dots. The origins of terrorism become more clear. The reasons for the abject poverty in developing countries can be seen as a direct result of greed at the very highest levels--not only in the corporate world, but in our own government as well. It would be easy to feel cynical after reading this book, but Perkins redeems himself throughout by constantly questioning his mission. He has subsequently done much to give back to those who suffered under the system that spawned him and other EHM. Visiting his website and learning how we as individuals can help alleviate the inequities in the world gives me a renewed sense of hope. Well done Mr. Perkins!"
1,Another Piece of Worthless Propaganda,"Ug. Where should I begin? This book was a HUGE waste of time. First of all, I found Mr. Perkins' discussion of his own internal moral conflict as self-righteous and BORING.Second of all, Mr. Perkins is no economist and as such, his denouncement of free trade and over-simplified views on US monetary policy should be treated as trash. I feel sorry for people who read this, do not think beyond the surface and take all Mr. Perkins says as fact. For real economic analysis, I'd suggest reading something else.Finally, as far as Mr. Perkins ""shocking"" conspiracy theories... unless you've been living under a rock, you will have read these all before in Vanity Fair and/or in the New York Times. Do not waste your money on this book -- it is worthless."
1,Self-righteous mumbo jumbo. Nothing of significance,"This book should be used for toilet paper. It shares nothing that the general public does not know. The author really hasn't repented despite feeling guilty about different things he has been involved it. There is no such thing as an EHM, only a sexy name given to themselves. There job is only to inflate things and paint a rosy picture. I cannot believe that huge companies belive that their false and rosy economic forecasts is the truth. It is asinine to think that the government s of the third world countries blindly buy into this just for thier own corrupt purposes. So what if these EHM did not do it. Someone else from other countries will do it. I think you just got hit by an EHM to buy this book or else?????? the jackals will come. It is only a woe is me book. Not worth it."
3,Confessions of an Economic Hit Man,"The book (on CD) is great so far. Very eye opening, and an excellent reader. I was disappointed however with the quality of the used CD I purchased. I didn't realize it was a former public library copy, though that info was available in the fine print/clicks I found after receiving it. The audio quality is poor and skips in many sections, and it is a bit on the grimy side too. It is very hard to rate since I like the book but am disappointed with the quality of the used copy, so I gave it a 3. I would give the book a 4 and the quality of the CD a 1 if I could rate them separately."
3,Ragged,"the story was almost compelling but not quite. it was a good read in terms of getting another perspective, but i did not feel sympathy or in any way bound to the author. he seems to write randomly and although i am sure he wrote reasonable economic reports his ability to emotionally involve me was limited. it seemed as though he couldn't quite grasp exactly what his theme was or maybe couldn't decide on a path.despite the fact that the writing wasn't that great, the information is interesting. although it is a bit consipiracy theory type of view point, it doesn't try to pretend it isn't. i dislike authors who couch unbelievable things in terms that make the unbeliever look unreasonable. Perkins at least gives the reader the respect of saying that some things are unbelievable. then he carefully steps through his points without haranguing the reader."
3,Hit Man,The author extrapolates a set of known facts into a global conspiracy. He then repeats his conspiracy theory over and over in an attempt to convince the reader that it is true. He should provide more proof and less justification about his personal motivation for writing the book.
2,Hit me and put me out of my misery,"It was a good story, possibly worthy of an Atlantic or Vanity Fair printing, but to make a whole book of it was a great stretch. The last half of the book was interminable; I only finished the book because I started it.Perhaps had this book been ghost-written it would have been more tolerable. But once the novelty of the story wears off (about halfway through the book) the amateurish writing style becomes grating. This is nothing new. I've read books by several successful businessmen who thought they were authors, and they just don't have it. Give me Fitzgerald or Dostoyevsky anyday. I am not a good writer, but I recognize one when I see one, and John Perkins is not one."
1,I can't recommend this book,"Should have been titled ""Confessions of an Conspiracy Theorist"" as it appears to be a totally anti-American hit piece."
1,fiction written badly,I found this work lacks any credibility. Usually a biographical work contains detail that makes for a story . This book does not and fails miserably as a story or as non-fiction . I would venture that it was written by a conspiracy theorist with a james bond complex.
2,Not as Impressed as I Hoped,I was hoping for more than the tale of Super E-Man who falls into the job. I was hoping for more.
2,Fake and boring,"The author wants to have it both ways - his actions are those of a ""hit man,"" yet his moral principles, if he is to be believedd, would entitle him to sainthood. Phoney, self-righteous, with no credibility."
4,Isplati se pro&#269;itati,"Zanimljiva knjiga koja otvara nove poglede na svakodnevne doga&#273;aje i zbivanja u krutom svijetu u kojemu &#382;ivimo. Doga&#273;aji oko vas, koje ste do &#269;itanja ove knjige promatrali kroz obi&#269;ne nao&#269;ale, nakon &#269;itanja ove knjige dobivaju nove obrise i konture i u dubini tkiva ih vidite, kao da gledate kroz rentgen.Sretno !"
2,Starts Out Good,"Book starts out pretty good. It was hard to put down, but then the author seemed to be more interested in blaming his complicit behaviors on a number of things. It felt like the reader was being used as a conscience clearing mechanism for the author.I admit that I didn't finish the book. I got half-way through it, but it just became so repetitive. Much vagueness in the book as well."
5,Enlightening,"This book summarises the true nature of global affairs. Why some countries remain at the top of the chain and why others remain categorized ""third world"" or ""developing countries"" - whatever that means. If you can think beyond patriotism and nationalism, and therefore think like a global citizen, then read it."
1,I COULDN'T FINISH LISTENING TO THIS CD!,"I was very disappointed in this book. The writing style made it impossible to continue listening after the third CD. Sentences were short, declarative and subjective. I really, really wanted this book to fulfill the potential promised, but the author sounded so immature, naive and obsessesed with women and self promotion that it was impossible to take him seriously. Self involved, superficial fluff about his personal life very little about the potentially fascinating world promised on the cover, I just couldn't keep listening. The author seemed to me to be a complete novice and I found myself wondering why his editor wasn't more helpful."
1,Boring ego trip,"Much of the economic premise of this book is obviously true. However, now it is presented as a personal reflection on a participants life. It feels like fiction and it probably is. In short, he is stealing from the poor and giving to the rich and continuously feels guilty about it, but still confinues this for decades.Why? He is a victim himself. As a youngster he was profiled by the NSA and they exploit their knowlegde of his weaknesses, to make him do these bad things!Some of his weaknesses are poor writing skills, too much fantasy, and a large ego that needs a boring life to be made interesting."
1,A total fabrication,"I spent most of my working career overseas on behalf of the U.S. Gov't.There is no such thing as an economic hitman, or any job resembling what Perkins claims he did.This is a total fabrication and Perkins is a con man."
2,Disappointing,"I'm of the typical ""conspiracy theorist"" bent. I like books like John K. Cooley's Unholy Wars and I like Noam Chomsky's Understanding Power. Having stated my bias, I was really disappointed in this book. Instead of stating facts, Perkins seems to put in his ideological view every other sentence. A few chapters are good, but a lot starts sounding downright corny."
1,I believe him. But why should you or me pay him?,"Having grown up in a different country, I heard lot of stories like this before. May be the terminology like EHM is new but nothing else. The content may be new to the general American public. But why is this guy writing this book now? May be he is out of Cash. Dont give him your money. This guy made his living with one of the worst possible jobs in the world, and now want to extort your money by confessing that. Naa.. not falling for that. I didnt buy it, didnt read it. Let him give all the money he make from this book to charity and then I will buy it. Isn't that a good approach folks? Let him die with guilt and he is not the one who deserve any attention."
2,Too populist to be trusted,"What could have been an important book turns out to be populist and untrustworthy due to trying to ""appeal"" to a wider audience, I suppose. Instead of all the sex allusions, the proselytizing and romanticizing I would have appreciated the true dry facts by themselves. The subject matter is too serious to be given that sort of treatment."
2,"Interesting Subject Matter, Poorly Written","I couldn't make it through this book.While many of the historical details are fascinating, the writing in this book is appalling. It's a clumsy first-person rumination on how power corrupted a man and how he came to self-realization too late. The personal insights are repetitive and dull. This could have been a great book in the hands of a competent writer."
2,Flights of fantasy detract from anything worthwhile,"If you want a sober, credible, and unforgiving insider critique of the doings of organizations like the IMF and World Bank, get Joseph Stiglitz's ""Globalization and Its Discontents"" instead of this bizarre little book. Stiglitz was the World Bank's chief economist so he knows how policy is shaped, and how it fails, at the highest levels. Perkins was just a consultant, one among hundreds, who get paid under contracts funded by organizations like the World Bank, USAID, etc. Somehow Perkins has suffered horrific delusions of grandeur, thinking that he was a principal agent in the downfall of a number of governments, and his cloak-and-dagger stuff is just too much. He was but a foot soldier in the consultancy army, stationed in faraway exotic places--a bit too long for his own good, it appears."
3,"Interesting, but preachy and somewhat hypocritical","Ever notice how aging rock stars find religion after years of partying and then go around telling young people not to party - AFTER they've had years of fun? The author got rich after a lifetime of exploitation and then goes around telling others not to do the same, instead of selling his posessions and giving the money to the exploited countries. Plus, he makes even more money from this book. It is an interesting book, but I could not get over the preachiness. 3 of 5."
2,Shaken NOT stirred!,"A strange book indeed. Aside from the amazing feats Perkins accomplishes with such mediocre intellectual capital, one should also be impressed by the flower child in him who endured for so long the role of an international pirate extraordinaire. One can also feel a Bond complex behid all this. There is a surreal feel to the whole book not to mention some really bad writing.Of course Corporate America aims to enrich its coffers first and above all. Is anyone really surprised by this revelation?The grand scheme of US generals of capitalism and ""deep state"" to control and conquer the World is blown up to impossible proportions. If only these people had displayed a fraction of these skills in managing their corporations and our wars.Unfortunately many of the events and tragic fates of various leaders of countries who tried to resist the US hegomonic policies are closer to truth than fiction. In fact, much of this is printed in your newspaper everyday in gory detail."
5,My Dad was right all along!,"Yup...Dad, my good conservative Republican father, told me the world worked just this way, but I wouldn't listen. Surely, I thought, people wouldn't do this to each other on purpose.I don't know how to respond to reviewers who doubt the credibility of Confessions. No red flags were raised to me, but then again, I have no background in the field.All I know is that this book was a riveting read. I could not put it down. And, with due respect to other reviewers, you do not have to be a paranoid leftie to think the world operates like Perkins describes. Not by a long shot."
2,so so,This book reads like a novel and less like a non-fiction. It draws to light the misguided spending of the US and other first world nations. It's not wildly enlightening but a fairly good read all the same.
5,"Whether you believe Perkins or not, this book should be read.","Have you ever wondered how the world really, really, really works? Perkins attempts to show insight into the secretive world of global finance, emphasis on markets, and the quest for American Empire.I really wanted to love this book, yet at times it felt more than a bit shallow. It is hard to know what is true and what may be distorted. Perhaps Perkins cannot come completely clean.Having lived abroad for several years in the 1990's I can attest to the ""Ugly-American"" syndrome, and how some have contempt for foreign cultures.Debt burden and the rise of the Corporatocracy are true and attestable. If you don't believe it, search for ""Project for a new American Century"" on Google. Take a look at the membership, and you will find many of the cast of characters within Perkins book.Remember, ""The greatest trick the Devil ever performed, is convincing the world he doesn't exist.""Cheers!"
2,Blade,"I like Merle Travis a lot, but the sound quality on this CD is very poor. It is old radio clips and it sounds like it."
2,The New Madrid Earthquakes-Technical Engineering Study,"This is a very technical dissertation on the New Madrid earthquakes. It concerns interpretation of relict liquefaction features.There are many charts and diagrams. I think the author needs to describe the technicalities of this item to the reader. There are geotechnical studies. This is not a book but a collection of scientific data and papers.I have studied Geology in college and this was beyond me. I don't understand why such a technical collection of papers is represented as a book on Amazon. I'm sure the author means well but most of us do not have PhDs in Geology.Sara Howard, Author of ""Something Funny Happened on The Way to The Moon"" and ""The Biggest Explosions in The Universe""."
4,Great FUN for any AGE,This is a great toy for any age. It has made a great gift for even an adult. I would recommend it to any music lover.
3,this was the stupidest thing i have ever put money on,What the hell? That is all i can say about this toy. The speaker function isn't very loud. It is not as big in person as it appears to be here. It also goes through batteries quickly.
3,Ok toy for the money.,Speaker not that great. Just got it for fun for my son. He seems to enjoy it. His aunt bought him a clock radio for his ipod and he uses that more for speaker use.
3,"Slightly interesting music, but no masterpieces","Margaret Sutherland (1897-1984) studied (privately) under Bax, but her music sounds more like Bliss than her erstwhile teacher; most prominently so in the energetic, sinewy Concerto for string orchestra. It is not as good as Bliss's Music for Strings, but is yet probably the best work on the disc. The Concerto Grosso is more neo-classical, while the violin concerto flirts with more modern forms of expression.Haunted Hills is, despite the title, not Baxian either, but this time it is the late Vaughan Williams who seems to be the closest stylistic point of reference. Overall, the music is interesting, but hardly world-shaking.Performances are somewhat on the rough side and does not flow as naturally as one might wish for. Sound quality is decent, if a little airless and dry. A worthwhile release, but I don't think my life would have been much different if I had never come across it."
4,"Very good, but a bit tedious","I stumbled upon the Starbridge series by reading the 4th book ""Scandalous Risks"", which I absolutely loved. I then decided to read the series starting with book 1, which introduces the character of Jon Darrow. In ""Glittering Images"", he is a wise and compelling priest who counsels a fellow priest. In ""Glamorous Powers"", we get to know Jon Darrow, at times ad nauseam, warts and all. I love the intelligent, energetic dialogue in Susan Howatch's books, but found this book almost too talky. The first 100 pages or so are particularly tedious. I found that I, as another reviewer admitted, grew a bit tired of Jon Darrow, whereas in ""Glittering Images"", I couldn't get enough of him. Nevertheless, this is a wonderful read with fascinating insight regarding spiritual pride, mystism, marriage, God's love and redemption."
1,Glamorous powers,"I chose the book because I loved others books written by Howatch, but this one unfortunately disapointed me a lot.-"
5,Revisiting an old friend,"I read this first 20 or so years ago, and I suddenly decided to go back and reread the whole series. They have aged well. Life in the hierarchy of the Church of England gives the novelist plenty of scope for drama and exposition of the various aspects of the church. Additionally, the author addresses the social changes wrought by World War I and II in theBritish world."
3,Polarizing Protagonist in C of E series,"Whether or not ""Glamorous Powers,"" the second of the six Church-of-England novels by Susan Howatch, appeals to you, will depend on your attraction to or disgust with the protagonist. In this book, as in no other of the series, the first-person narrator, ordained priest Jonathan Darrow, sets the mood and the tone, and dominates the proceedings from beginning to end. The reason my review has only three stars, is because the character of Jonathan Darrow is, for me, a three-star narrator and not a five-star narrator! Why not admit to my own bias? Especially when father Darrow is one of the most disruptive and polarizing of all the clergymen populating Howatch's fictitious Starbridge diocese, and that is indeed saying something. His character -- and, as I think of it, his novel, his story -- are guaranteed to divide and polarize readers of the Starbridge series into pro-Darrow and con-Darrow factions."
2,Disappointing - if you want the 'real' Zorba,Disappointing. This is NOT the movie soundtrack. This does NOT feature Anthony Quinn (Mr Zorba the Greek!). This is NOT Mikis Theodorakis' music. The music is bland and artificial - definitely not Greek enough by my standards. I suppose one had to see the play to appreciate this CD
4,Zorba,Zorba is a show I saw many years ago and I enjoyed very much. I am glad this show was available. I enjoy listening to this as much now as I did when I first saw theshow
2,Not The Movie Soundtrack,The album was disappointing as I expected Mikis Theodorakis' music quality.
3,Very bad packaging,"The movies themselves are great but the packaging is terrible. All three movies are sitting on top of each other in a single case. They could of at least made it a double dvd case so only one would be stacked on another. Other than that they came in good condition and the movies are great. All are in original TohoScope ratios, Englis running time 259 minutes and Japanese running time 277 minutes, English subs, English and Japanese Languages. Special Features are commentaries on Mothra and Battle in Outer Space by Authors and Japanese SciFi Historians Steve Ryfle and Ed Godziszewski."
5,Excellent Movie in SP Mode!!!,"This is a very interesting movie for all you Godzilla fans. Mothra is a little bit bigger in this movie (as opposed to Godzilla vs. Mothra), and it is a very enjoyable movie. The best thing about it is SP mode! Yes, the Toho movie distribution people finally decided that we would be allowed to view a movie in SP mode. Weird but true!"
3,Great Movies but Horrible Packaging,I give these great clasic Toho movies a 4.5! The dvd case however has the three movies stacked on top of each other. It was a miracle that none of the discs were scratched during shipping. I hope this trend stops for companies getting cheap with their package design.
4,"A must-have for kaiju enthusiasts, but for anyone else . . .","The original Mothra is an interesting movie. It relies on human drama much more than the average kaiju movie that I've seen, but still manages to keep up the monster action enough to keep your attention. Unfortunately, the monster action isn't very exciting. After smashing a dam and a building or two, the catapillar spins a cocoon around Tokyo tower, only to be ""fried"" by a new military weapon. But, after it hatches into a giant moth, the kaiju destruction really looks like nothing more than a hurricane documentary.However, if you are a kaiju enthusiast like me, you'll love the movie for what it is and not so much what it has to offer in monster destruction. But, if your looking for a cheep monster flick, you may enjoy this, but you may not. This movie is really based on personal preference."
2,Pretty bad,Okay it wasnt awful.The story begin some show guys capture 2 small girls and have them sing some strange song on a stage and a giant egg hatchs and a caterpillar type thing comes out and is swimming towards Tokyo.
5,What took them so long?,"OK, I'll say it, ""Thanks, Sony!"" But it's about time you got around to these movies."
4,Great Sci-Fi collection!,"From the golden age of Japanese Sci-Fi era, this three film reproduced in their original aspect-ratio is a must for Sci-Fi film lovers, all three movies are from Toho production company filmed during 1959-61 and directed by Iconic Japanese director Ishiiro Honda (Gojira). The only problem is the packaging, each film is in a single DVD disc which is great considering some film collection has 4 movies in a single disc (dual layered), the problem is all three discs are stacked one on top of each other, with no dividing panel, if you take good care of your dvd disc, this should not pose as a problem... happy viewing"
4,"Good, but could have been better","I had high expectations for this collection, and while it mostly met them -- bringing out three rare Toho flicks that used to be seen maybe once a year on some weekday afternoon -- when I compare it to the other Toho film series releases currently available (the Godzilla collection from Classic Media and the Tokyo Shock non-Godzilla tokusatsu flicks) it comes up short.The discs are stacked right atop each other with nothing between them, and they are very bare-bones offerings: the original films with English subtitles and the Anmerican-International releases. It is good to see just how the original films differed from the afternoon TV versions I saw, but the former two series of releases included trailers, documentaries, and some very entertaining commentaries by Toho/Godzilla fans of considerable knowledge. Good work here, but try to get it at a discount if you can."
5,Fabulous,"I watched this movie as a child and it was incredible. it all seemed to make sense in terms of the ""longing"" of Mothra to find the girls and bring them back home. As a woman, I do not have that same feeling however it was a work of art in terms of plot -- like all great movies it all seems to fit together like the pieces of a puzzle. There is a major subplot here: the longing of the Japanese people to reunite with the ""islanders"". OH MY GOD it is a different type of longing and I still feel it!! LOL Great movie!"
4,It sounds like...,"...clsider is asking about Godzilla and Mothra: the Battle for Earth. It came out in the early 90's, but that's the only other film I can think of that would fit her description.Mothra is one of Toho's most interesting creations, so much so that she eventually got her own series in the mid-90's. It would be nice if someone would port this film to DVD so that it could be enjoyed by those who no longer have a VHS player."
4,Mothra the Original,This Mothral flick was indeed boring when I saw it but the reason I rate it high because for one it teaches you a lessonin this movie and the other reason Its the original mothra black and white film!!The original twins in this movie gets capture and taken on display for money not until they call on mothra to come help them.Overal this movie is alright but dont expect a lot of mothra action cus overal its a good story rather then a cheesy monster flick.
3,The other film with those unforgettable twins....,"...which another viewer asked about was, I believe, Ghidrah: the Three-Headed Monster."
4,Works,"Thin velco. However, it serves it purpose. I got it to secure bikes tires from swinging. It wasn't long enough for my bike, so ended up using two of them."
2,One best to avoid,"When I picked this CD up I thought it was going to be pretty cool. I have always like Tom Cochrane and Red Rider. However after putting this CD in my player it quickly came out after a couple of listenings.The first problem is Tom Cochrane is clearly a studio/electric musician because his voice on this CD was none too good. Most of the songs found on Songs of a Circling Spirit are not good unplugged covers...I may have liked only a couple, but hardly worth the effort to find them or struggle through the rest of the CD.But his other 2 albums LONG before buying this one."
3,good stuff,"Cypress keeps dropping cd's every few months, which is a good thing for a fan like me. Stash is a 6 song remix disc of some old-to-new material, most of which is somewhat obscure. You won't find any ""kill a man"" or ""insane in the brain"" on here. The remixes are pretty tight, but this type of project is suited for a hardcore fan of cypress."
2,illusions harpsichord mix,"I dont understand, Im trying to find this song and I keep finding the clean version. I dont want the clean version, I recently heard it on youtube and it was not the clean version. So where did that song come from?"
2,Awful,"This EP is not worth your money unless you're a hardcore Cypress Hill fan who has ate up every other cd they put out. Definitely the worst in their whole repertoire. I would've preferred the first 5 songs being unedited. The remixes of the songs aren't better than the originals. The beats alone are good, and the originals are good, but together, it just sounds recycled, like a forced release thrown together to make a few bucks. There's nothing going on in this EP. Its boring, to say the least. The only reason I've even given it 2 stars is because I think any Cypress Hill is tolerable. Its not so bad you can't listen to it ever, but its bad enough to end up at the bottom of your cd collection. Stick with the originals, they're much better. If you buy this, it won't be in your cd player very long."
1,Not another one!,"I'm tired of recycled material being released as albums. Cypress Hill has already released ""Unreleased and Revamped"", a Spanish remix album of some of their songs, and the live album. Now we see this, mediocre remix of some of their past hits. Leave well enough alone and stop releasing recycled material."
4,great book for U. S. Space fans,"Too bad we don't have a few serviceable Saturn 5s around, due to LBJ's war, and a stupid Congress. Additionally. NASA's role in killing the Aur Force's dynasoar and Manned Orbiting Labatory (MOL)was power grabbing at its worst! Who knows what might have been if the X15 was further developed? Instead we got the space shuttle, when what we needed was big dumb booster rockets, and a true space plane, rather than the hybrid/bastard space shuttle."
2,Disappointing book,"I was an engineer on Gemini and Apollo and found many technical and historical errors in this book (i.e., pg 131, Apollo 11 launched on July 17?). The book is also very poorly organized. Check it out of the library."
1,They fall down.,"These socks don't stay up and that's simply unacceptable, especially in a work situation. I'm very disappointed and will be less inclined to buy Hue footwear in the future."
5,GREAT Socks!!!!!,"Finally, I found the perfect knee socks! These are the only socks I will buy from now on. They are very comfortable, and not too tight at the top. When I do a lot of walking, they slip down some, but not as bad as all the other brands I've tried. Thank you, Hue!"
3,Nice quality but too small,"I have muscular calves out of proportion for my size 8-10, so I ordered these in Plus hoping they wouldn't cut my circulation off just to make wearing high heels easier vs. no socks. I guess other people must have pretty skinny calves to call these plus? I can't imagine wearing them all day, they are too tight. it's too bad because the actual quality of these is REALLY nice, like their tights."

2,A Disappointment,"I found this DVD a large disappointment. I expected more what with all the 2012 hype that's starting now (move over Y2K). The treatment of the subject is too Hollywood and superficial. The DVD is modeled after ""The Secret"", however, THAT was a much better and well done video compared to this one. I found this boring, repetitive, and hardly worth the money or the time spent watching it. I guess I'll donate it to someone just to get rid of it. Such a shame, when so much could have been done with this subject."
1,Silly! its on netflix dont waste money,It starts in black and white with a guy telling a weird poem while some subpar terrible special effect is going on. Then it goes to color and he's out side hugging a tree? I got a good laugh then shut it off cause it simply isn't good unless you idea of good is this
1,be careful,"this story is listed at print length on the kindle store at 130 pages. it is not. try about only about 2000 words at most. but it is simple short read that has done before. not sure where all the hype is coming for this ""short story""?"
3,Just reviewing this ONE VERY short story,"The information and other reviewers led me to believe that this was a collection of stories. That's not true. It is ONE VERY short story.However, I'm not letting that affect my review.The story itself was rather predictable. Just a classic story of revenge, no twist, no mystery, ho-hum.However, the writing was top-notch! I will be checking out this author's other works. Should he come up with a good plot, I am certain his books will be awesome!"
4,Good stuff!,"Okay, so it is not as good as the author's novels, particularly NIGHT OF THE WEREWOLF (which ROCKS) and I almost knocked off another half a star for a couple of stories I felt had slightly obvious ""twist"" endings, overall this is a terrific piece of work for a first-time-out collection. The climax of ""Loose Ends"" did catch me me totally off guard. ""She Who Is Kali"" grossed me out and then made me laugh. The author's style is reminiscent of Ed Gorman, Michael Connelly and at times even Stephen King. Good fun, good read. Quite a collectors item now, too..."
